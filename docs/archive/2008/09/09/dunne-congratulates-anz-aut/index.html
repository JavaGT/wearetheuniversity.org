<p>Dunne congratulates ANZ, AUT</p>
<p>Minister of Revenue the Honourable Peter Dunne congratulated ANZ National Bank as the first corporate member of a new centre that takes business philanthropy beyond chequebook charity.</p>
<p>The AUT University Centre for Community Investment and Development (CCID), launched last week by the Minister at the Beehive, was established by organisations interested in social and community investment.</p>
<p>The centre aims to fulfil the mission of the Community Impact Group, formed in 2007, whose members include ANZ, IBM, Lifewise, Volunteering New Zealand, Nick Jones and Associates and Minister for Revenue, the Honourable Peter Dunne.</p>
<p>Dunne says CIG evolved alongside legislative changes, enacted in April 2008, which heralded a change to charitable donation tax laws. Its mission is to &#39;increase social investment by promoting full interaction and common purpose between business, government and the community&#39;.</p>
<p>Dunne says the centre is much more than fine ideas floating around a room, it&#39;s about doing and telling.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not just about feeding the homeless people and providing a shelter for them,&quot; he says. &quot;It&#39;s about professionalising; it&#39;s about utilising skills and it&#39;s about bringing people together so that all of the good will that&#39;s out there can be channelled to effective use.&quot;</p>
<p>The centre acknowledges that corporate citizenship requires a more holistic investment than has been present in corporate giving up until now. This can include anything from the provision of human resource management, product and service development, marketing, public relations through to developing and accessing new markets.</p>

<p>Dunne adds that establishment of a national centre to address change in New Zealand communities fits with a mood shift that&#39;s occurring globally.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not something we could have done five, let alone ten years ago. The mood and the times weren&#39;t right,&quot; says Dunne. &quot;This is the right time; this is an important initiative.&quot;</p>
<p>AUT and the CCID will bring together government agencies and corporates with community organisations. The centre will lead implementation and management of community investment projects and apply academic rigour to research in this field.</p>
<p>The Minister applauded ANZ and AUT for working together to drive permanent social change that will benefit New Zealand.</p>
<p>Notes for Editors:</p>
<p>The Centre for Community Investment and Development has been jointly established by AUT University&#39;s Institute of Public Policy (IPP) and AUT University Relations and Advancement.</p>
