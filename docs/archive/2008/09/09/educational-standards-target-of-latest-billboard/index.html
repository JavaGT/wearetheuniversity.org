<p>John Key MP</p>
<p>National Party Leader</p>
<p>9 September 2008</p>
<p>Educational standards target of latest billboard</p>
<p>The complacency with which Labour treats educational achievement has been targeted in National&#39;s latest billboard, says National Party Leader John Key.</p>
<p>Ten billboards are going up in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch.</p>
<p>&quot;One in five students leaves school without even basic NCEA qualifications,&quot; says Mr Key. &quot;This is completely unacceptable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In order to ensure students finish school with a useful educational qualification, we must address the failure in their early school years.</p>
<p>&quot;National has already announced that we will set national standards in reading, writing, and maths.</p>
<p>&quot;We will assess all primary and intermediate school pupils against these standards.</p>
<p>&quot;If a child is finding it hard learning how to read, write, and do maths, and the problem isn&#39;t addressed, they have no chance of leaving school in their teens with a qualification.</p>
<p>&quot;That is robbing them of opportunities, and we owe it to our children to do something about this major issue.</p>
<p>&quot;National is far more ambitious for our children, and will campaign on delivering them the brighter future they deserve.</p>
<p>&quot;Since Monday last week National has launched a number of billboards on the issues we believe New Zealanders are concerned about.</p>
<p>&quot;National will be resolutely focused on the issues that matter. I believe the public is ready for a fresh start from a new government.&quot;</p>
