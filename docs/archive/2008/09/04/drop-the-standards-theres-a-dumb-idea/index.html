<p>Anne Tolley MP<br>National Party Education Spokeswoman</p>
<p>4 September 2008</p>
<p>Drop the standards – there’s a dumb idea</p>
<p>A suggestion that NCEA Level 1 should be dumbed down has astounded National’s Education spokeswoman, Anne Tolley.</p>
<p>“At a time when one in five children leave school unable to read, write or do maths anywhere near their chronological age, this suggestion defies belief.</p>
<p>“Dropping NCEA’s Level 1 ‘pass’ point from 80 credits to 60 credits would be extraordinarily short-sighted.</p>
<p>“We want to raise education standards, not lower them. That is why National will test all students from the time they first enter school.</p>
<p>“This suggestion is an admission that younger children are not getting the help they need. If they were, there would be no need to drop the pass rate.</p>
<p>“This is one step away from ditching exams altogether. What future will our children face if they do not have an education that will equip them?</p>
<p>“Education is vitally important. Our children are already failing. Around 150,000 leave school without the skills to get themselves a decent job.</p>
<p>“The answer is not to drop the standards for these children, but to raise our expectations of them from the day they enter school.</p>
<p>“National intends to raise the bar, not lower it.”</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
