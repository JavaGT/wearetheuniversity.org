<p>Immimgration Policy That Works</p>
<p>On Saturday the Korean Society held a meeting at Westlake Boys’ High School for candidates from all parties. There were close to 1,000 people present, mostly from North Shore. The most important issues for the Korean community are immigration policy, and the ability to maintain the viability of the Korean community in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Silver Fern visa</p>
<p>National has given a lot of thought to immigration policy. In particular, we need to ensure that New Zealand has an appropriate skill base. That is why a central feature of our policy is the Silver Fern Visa. The Silver Fern Visa will enable people with recognised tertiary qualifications to be in New Zealand for a short period of time to seek permanent employment in highly-skilled areas which are of high value to the New Zealand economy.</p>
<p>In order to give New Zealand education providers a competitive edge, Silver Fern Visa holders with New Zealand-obtained qualifications will face a lower remuneration for- work threshold than those with qualifications obtained overseas. This means New Zealand will be getting immigrants who have New Zealand qualifications, surely the ideal migrant.</p>
<p>Further details of the proposed Silver Fern visa are available at:<br><a href="http://national.org.nz/files/2008/immigration%20policy%20and%20backgrounder.pdf">http://national.org.nz/files/2008/immigration%20policy%20and%20backgrounder.pdf</a><br>Immigration and citizenship<br>Currently immigration and citizenship are divided into two separate government departments. The Immigration Service is part of the Department of Labour, and citizenship comes under the Department of Internal Affairs. National believes it would make sense to combine the two into a single department, which would be more accountable, and will be able to develop a better settlement policy.</p>

<p>National will explore the possibility of establishing a standalone Department of Immigration and Citizenship, combining existing resources and functions currently within Immigration New Zealand and the Department of Internal Affairs. This outcome would only be acceptable if we could be assured it could occur within existing resources and would not lead to a rise in the number of bureaucrats.</p>
<p>OUT AND ABOUT</p>
<p>On Saturday the Governor General opened the new Wilson School building for the disabled. This is a completely new school facility to replace the existing inadequate facilities. The Wilson School has been in existence for 70 years. They will now have modern facilities that will endure for many years to come. Among the guests was Judge Mick Brown. He told me he was a student at the school in the 1940s, and in the bed next to him was motor racing legend Bruce McLaren.</p>
<p>Overcoming disability is the goal of the school, so that people can fulfil their dreams.</p>
