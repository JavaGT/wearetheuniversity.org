<p>Reckless waste of taxpayers’ money to re-hash policy</p>
<p>Labour’s frenzied, last-minute spending spree has reached a new low with news that hundreds of school principals are being flown to Wellington for what is being called a ‘briefing’ on Labour’s Schools Plus policy, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Anne Tolley.</p>
<p>“Schools that are struggling to raise funds are appalled that Labour can find tens of thousands of dollars to fly in 120 principals at the taxpayers’ expense as a gimmick to sell this flawed policy.</p>
<p>“Schools Plus is an admission that Labour has badly failed young people.</p>
<p>“In 2002 they signed the Mayor’s Taskforce for Jobs agreement and promised to have ‘every 15 to 19-year-old in work, training, education, or another constructive activity for their future’ by 2007.</p>
<p>“They failed that time, so they’re re-heating their old goal under the Schools Plus guise. Why should we believe they’ll get to their 2014 target this time?</p>
<p>“Schools are struggling to find money for essentials and Labour thinks it’s perfectly reasonable to throw all these education dollars at airfares, rental cars, and petrol to brief them on a doomed policy that few of them have any confidence in.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow’s briefing to principals, which could just as easily be delivered by email, is a shameful waste of money that would be far better spent where it’s useful – on our children’s education.”</p>
