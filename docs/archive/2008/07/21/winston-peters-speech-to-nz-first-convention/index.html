<p>Winston Peters Speech to NZ First Convention: “When Tomorrow Comes”</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters<br>New Zealand First Annual Conference<br>1.30pm Sunday 20 July 2008<br>Alexandra Park<br>Auckland</p>
<p>It has been a great conference and thank you to the many hands who have contributed to this success.</p>
<p>To George Groombridge, the Board, all of you work on a voluntary basis – thank you.</p>
<p>To my caucus colleagues, Deputy Leader Peter Brown, Ron Mark, Doug Woolerton, Barbara Stewart, Pita Paraone and Dail Jones – thank you.</p>
<p>These men and woman have served you and this country well.</p>
<p>They are an integral part of the fabric of New Zealand politics and our country is a better place because they are there.</p>
<p>In celebrating 15 years as a political party this week we recognise the many people who have played a central role in our success.</p>
<p>Some in this room were here at the beginning, at this very venue.</p>
<p>Others joined us along the way.</p>
<p>To each of you who have played your part in building this great party – thank you.</p>
<p>Some people might think 15 years is a long time in politics.</p>
<p>Well, we have news for our opponents – we’ve only just begun!</p>
<p>But let’s make no mistake. What we know points to the dirtiest campaign New Zealand has ever seen, full of smears, allegations and lies.</p>
<p>But it’s a compliment that we are the target.</p>
<p>Our enemies know that if they can’t get rid of Winston Peters and New Zealand First, then their intended conspiracy against the public will fail.</p>
<p>Advertisement - scroll to continue reading</p>
<p>So we will make our enemies a pact. If they stop telling lies about us, we will stop telling the truth about them.</p>
<p>We have so much more to do. New Zealand needs hope again - real hope for ordinary New Zealanders.</p>
<p>We need hope built on our unity and belief in ourselves.</p>
<p>We need hope built on Kiwi ingenuity and the Kiwi way of life.</p>
<p>We need hope built on fair incomes.</p>
<p>We need hope built on safer streets and shared values.</p>
<p>We need hope that our education prepares our children for a better future.</p>
<p>We need hope that their better future is here in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Parents need hope that there will be job security, affordable housing, proper healthcare and a life outside work.</p>
<p>We need hope that our citizens work to live not live to work.</p>
<p>Senior citizens need hope that generations following them can build on their hard work and sacrifice, and learn from their experience.</p>
<p>But most importantly, we need hope built on action.</p>
<p>If we are going to have a better tomorrow we must act today.</p>
<p>New Zealand First has a plan of action.</p>
<p>It uses New Zealand solutions for New Zealand problems.</p>
<p>What we used to do when we were a great country.</p>
<p>For more than twenty years now, the two old parties have got the social and economic mix wrong.</p>
<p>They have imported foreign money, ideas and culture, while exporting jobs, talent and profits.</p>
<p>They have governed for other peoples, but not ours.</p>
<p>If it seems like we are going backwards – it is because we are.</p>
<p>We must head in a new direction.</p>
<p>Keeping our brightest and best, generating our own ideas, and developing and exporting our products and services so the profits flow back to us.</p>
<p>We would get richer, we would provide better healthcare, education and social services, and once again we would set the benchmark for other countries.</p>
<p>In comparison with successful economies, it is not that we are spending too much, but that we are simply not earning enough.</p>
<p>Today the National Party is transfixed on cutting spending while having no idea about wealth creation.</p>
<p>Others are obsessed with defending spending whilst missing the point; reduced spending will flow from real wealth creation.</p>
<p>The fourth Labour government introduced income support because their economic plan was dramatically failing. Little has changed since.</p>
<p>These economic plans failed because they were imported from economies different to ours.</p>
<p>So the solution is for New Zealanders to start providing the answers again.</p>
<p>It means throwing people at problems – not buckets of taxpayers&#39; money.</p>
<p>It must occur at the community level and not be imposed from grey concrete buildings somewhere in Wellington.</p>
<p>Here are some examples.</p>
<p>There are thousands of gang members in this country – a blight with its origins in overseas ideas.</p>
<p>Gangs have fused the LA style gangster culture of drugs and violence with disenfranchised urban Maori and in doing so have bastardized Maori culture.</p>
<p>Across the racial divide, others have adopted the views of violent racists.</p>
<p>You could not think of a more poisonous cocktail of social misfits and criminals.</p>
<p>The result is New Zealand now riddled with violent crime, drug dealing, intimidation and teen prostitution.</p>
<p>The gangs are the most visible – the most blatant – the most in-your-face manifestation of the breakdown in law and order.</p>
<p>Brazen and cocky, the patched gang members strut and preen themselves in our streets and outside social welfare offices where they pick up their dole.</p>
<p>The message they send to the young and the impressionable in their communities is unmistakable.</p>
<p>That message is “the police are impotent - we the patched gangsters, have the real power!”</p>
<p>We have a clear message today. Things are going to change.</p>
<p>For too long gangs have been tolerated and indulged by successive governments.</p>
<p>They have been too scared to confront the long term causes of violent crime and the breakdown of traditional families and communities.</p>
<p>New Zealand First recognises that the root causes of crime demand long-term, local solutions.</p>
<p>First, in the short term, we are going to make life real hard for them.</p>
<p>Those who are a clear and present danger to our society with their record of criminal offending should be locked up until they are too old to harm anyone.</p>
<p>It is simple crim-onomics. That word means that if it costs more socially and economically to have them outside, which it does, than inside, – then the solution is clear.</p>
<p>You do the maths, insurance costs, car conversions, drugs, health costs, law enforcement costs - the list goes on. Having them on the outside costs us billions a year.</p>
<p>We are no longer going to go on paying the wages of fear.</p>
<p>Where there is hope among them – we will help them get out, and stay out, of the gang culture.</p>
<p>Ultimately however, the answer to the gangs and criminal offending is to raise a generation of people who are not attracted to a disgusting anti-social lifestyle.</p>
<p>Too many children and young people in New Zealand are being shortchanged as a result of:</p>
<p>Family dysfunction and abuse</p>
<p>Low levels of educational achievement</p>
<p>Tolerance of criminality and violence.</p>
<p>Today many young New Zealanders are not being raised to be proud and responsible citizens.</p>
<p>Tell me – would the Kahui twins have died if their mother had been mentored by caring members of her community about parenting and personal responsibility?</p>
<p>If the boys&#39; father had been taken under the wing of a fatherly figure, taught him how to be a real man, to face up to his responsibilities, to get a job, and to support his young family?</p>
<p>So what difference would the right people make to this scenario, and the thousands of others like them, in communities throughout New Zealand?</p>
<p>Because sadly, too many parents have abandoned their responsibility to teach their children right from wrong.</p>
<p>They have lost their social compass and conscience.</p>
<p>This is an epidemic.</p>
<p>And what is the answer?</p>
<p>What will build a strong, Maori and Pacific middle class, which has the economic means and the fortitude to resolve this crisis?</p>
<p>One thing is clear – simply throwing more money and more government inquiries at the problem won’t deliver any improvement.</p>
<p>Strong communities are built on people – people helping other people.</p>
<p>And more than ever we need the right people playing key roles in rebuilding our communities.</p>
<p>New bold leadership.</p>
<p>Rebuilding our society on tried and true traditional values.</p>
<p>And the people most often able to pick up this burden are the women.</p>
<p>They represent real hope.</p>
<p>They raise our children which are our future.</p>
<p>We need more women playing a more prominent part in our communities.</p>
<p>The strongest societies and communities are those where men and women work together.</p>
<p>Behind every great community are great men and women – each playing their part. We should not be afraid of embracing what is strong and enduring about women in our communities.</p>
<p>As a society we have never properly dealt with the fallout of Maori and Pacific urbanisation during the 50s to the 80s.</p>
<p>The loss of their traditional social anchors left many in these cultures adrift.</p>
<p>We need to see community leadership that reclaims those hardworking traditional values that underpinned the great Maori and Pacific cultures.</p>
<p>The values of Ratana, the Maori Battalion, of the Maori Women’s Welfare League and Maori Wardens, and great leaders like Sir Apirana Ngata.</p>
<p>The values of respect for elders, of respecting property, of belonging to a community, of knowing right from wrong.</p>
<p>And it is not for the government to force these values on society – they must come from within.</p>
<p>But a government can help with policies which promote the economic and social conditions in which communities thrive.</p>
<p>These communities will provide leadership that will guide and inspire young Maori and Pacific people to achieve.</p>
<p>We know there is no magic wand to save a lost generation.</p>
<p>The choice is ours – either act now with local wisdom and proven solutions – or lose this generation forever and pay the social cost for decades to come.</p>
<p>Time and time again New Zealand First has come up with the answers to serious problems.</p>
<p>This party has called for investment law reform for fifteen long years.</p>
<p>We’ve witnessed successive governments more concerned with protecting directors than investors and shareholders.</p>
<p>The jungle that they have defended has seen collapse after collapse and the loss of over three billion dollars of largely older peoples’ money.</p>
<p>We’ve seen the Bluechips, the Bridgecorps and 25 others go belly up losing your money.</p>
<p>It is scandalous that parliament has long refused to act to defend a key component of the free market.</p>
<p>We will not rest until investors are paramount and the prison sentences for those defrauding them are the same as the United States.</p>
<p>Past governments have failed but we will not because we are the only party that takes the same view of white collar crime as any other crime.</p>
<p>This party was founded on the Winebox, the BNZ and the sellout of New Zealand.</p>
<p>When no one would raise a finger – we raised the roof, spending our own personal money to do it.</p>
<p>Likewise we need bold and decisive New Zealand based policy for savings and foreign ownership.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that our economy is hemorrhaging from daily transfusions to Australian-owned banks and foreign interests.</p>
<p>This financial blood letting must be staunched.</p>
<p>The Cullen Fund and KiwiSaver are helping lift New Zealand’s savings performance – and that is why we supported them – but they do not go far enough.</p>
<p>New Zealand First wants to put an investment programme in place to reduce foreign ownership of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Our real savings will enable us to buy back our strategic assets now in foreign hands.</p>
<p>It is simplistic and naïve in the extreme for others to talk about GDP growth when so much of the profits go into foreign hands.</p>
<p>Why do we hear so much talk from National about offshore money for infrastructure.</p>
<p>We regard ACC as key infrastructure. Under National’s plan Australian insurance companies will decide if you get injury compensation and for how long.</p>
<p>New Zealanders should be given the opportunity to invest in a designated fund that targets local infrastructure and sound companies.</p>
<p>Remember the Auckland airport was 250 percent oversubscribed by New Zealanders so why are we shutting our own people out</p>
<p>We are calling it - The New Zealand Fund – to be launched after the next election.</p>
<p>How much more sensible would it be for New Zealanders to put money into such a fund to rebuild our nation’s future - than the billions that have disappeared into failed finance companies and shonky property deals.</p>
<p>Here is an example.</p>
<p>This past week government agreed to sell a Wellington power network to Chinese interests.</p>
<p>This is the same madness that gripped the governments of the eighties and nineties.</p>
<p>And whilst we are at it, with power prices going through the roof, why are we not amalgamating the power companies created during the mindless National Party reforms?</p>
<p>Why don’t we buy those back and provide cheaper power to New Zealand households and businesses?</p>
<p>The other parties are trapped in a time warp over this.</p>
<p>They are happy to sell our power infrastructure to offshore interests whose concern is not our long term security but their short term profits.</p>
<p>Why not give a huge competitive advantage to our exporters and help every household budget?</p>
<p>New Zealand First is the only party really prepared to address the poisoned chalice of Douglas and Richardson.</p>
<p>That is the type of New Zealand-based solution we are talking about - bringing New Zealand thinking to the issue of economic cohesion and social stability in our society.</p>
<p>Our future as a nation is only secure as long as the things that unite us are stronger than the things that divide us.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen in our country, multiculturalism, whatever that means, has become an excuse to ignore what is really happening to our society.</p>
<p>There is a world of difference between being multicultural and multiculturalism.</p>
<p>One is to respect other cultures - the other to actively promote every culture - and therein lie the seeds of ethnic strife.</p>
<p>If we are to all head in a different direction, based on fifty different cultural values, for our ship of state, no wind will be the right wind.</p>
<p>It’s already happening. It’s in the news most nights, but only one party has the solution.</p>
<p>Yes, we are a nation with many immigrants – so it is imperative we think seriously about the values and vision we must share.</p>
<p>We came here to build a new country with its own culture, not a resettlement of fifty different cultures from somewhere else.</p>
<p>And that is the reason we remain vigilant about the rate of immigration and where our future citizens come from.</p>
<p>The politically correct habit of seeing the world through “multiculturalism” spectacles is against New Zealand’s interests.</p>
<p>In New Zealand First we believe in looking at things with our eyes wide open.</p>
<p>New Zealand already has one race-based party in Parliament.</p>
<p>Tell me what if we had an Asian party – a Pacific party – or even – heaven forbid - an all-whites party?</p>
<p>We’ve already heard calls for this. Look at what is happening in Auckland – the immigration capital of New Zealand – just last night on TV the tragedy of our flawed immigration system was highlighted.</p>
<p>Murders and kidnapping.</p>
<p>Our convention was pushed to third place – remember the years we spent warning them this would happen.</p>
<p>The crime wave in Auckland is all too real – as are its racial and ethnic undertones.</p>
<p>When the Asian community mobilised and marched in strength a few weeks ago to protest against attacks they sent a signal to the rest of New Zealand.</p>
<p>That message was that this community is not prepared to play some politically correct game of turning the other cheek.</p>
<p>“We in the Asian community are not going to be ‘culturally intimidated’ even if the rest of you are,” their leader said before he admitted the Chinese triads were already here.</p>
<p>The response of the Asian community was honest – but if anyone missed the ethnic dimension of the protest they are willfully blind.</p>
<p>The New Zealand based solution is clear.</p>
<p>We are a tolerant and inclusive people. But we do have a uniquely Kiwi way of life based on long held values to defend.</p>
<p>That is why we must include the people of New Zealand in decision-making over matters of immigration.</p>
<p>We must support those who come to this country with a proper civics education programme which ensures our values and basic laws are taught and understood.</p>
<p>But we reject the callous negligence that sees us with the most scandalous immigration policy in the western world.</p>
<p>Does anyone believe this week’s Indian pilgrimage story?</p>
<p>If any recent immigrant is behind this scam his lawful right to be here should be revoked. The answer to our future is where it has always been.</p>
<p>It is with you.</p>
<p>When tomorrow comes, you, the people, will provide the lasting answers we need.</p>
<p>When tomorrow comes, you must take back your country.</p>
<p>You must continue to help the young mother next door.</p>
<p>You must share your wise counsel with the young.</p>
<p>When tomorrow comes, you must stop our future being decided in a foreign board room.</p>
<p>When tomorrow comes, you must demand leadership prepared to fight for New Zealanders first.</p>
<p>In a few months the people will be asked to pick a new government.</p>
<p>The foreign-owned media are already deciding who it shall be.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t let them.</p>
<p>When tomorrow comes, the people will be in charge of this country.</p>
<p>When tomorrow comes, we will start rebuilding our nation again.</p>
<p>When tomorrow comes, we will do it together.</p>
<p>So let’s go back to our electorates, our communities, our streets, our suburbs, our country lanes with a clear message.</p>
<p>This party has the policies and the people, the record and the resolution for a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>But we must act today.</p>
<p>There comes a tide in the affairs of men, which, if taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.</p>
