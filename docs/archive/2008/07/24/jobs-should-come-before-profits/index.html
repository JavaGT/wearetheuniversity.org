<p><strong>Thursday, 24 July 2008, 12:49 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Workers_Party_of_New_Zealand">Workers Party of New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Jobs Should Come Before Profits</p>
<p>As the recession bites, workers are again carrying the heaviest burden.<br>The layoffs just announced at Silver Fern Farms&#39; Belfast plant are<br>another sign that the current parties have nothing left to offer<br>workers. ﻿The Workers Party thinks jobs for all should come before<br>profits for private companies and supports action by workers to keep<br>their jobs, including occupations of workplaces threatened with closure.<br>As a first step, the Workers Party of New Zealand will abolish GST<br>because it is a regressive tax that hits workers particularly hard.</p>
<p>We are launching our Christchurch Electoral campaign at 7pm on Monday<br>July 28th. The campaign launch will be held in the WEA at 59 Gloucester<br>St.</p>
<p>The Workers Party is standing two candidates in Christchurch<br>electorates: secondary school teacher and former meat worker Paul<br>Hopkinson in Christchurch East and retail worker and student Byron Clark<br>in Christchurch Central. We also have candidates standing in Auckland<br>and Wellington. If elected, WP candidates have pledged to use their<br>parliamentary resources to support workers&#39; struggles and campaigns.<br>Workers Party policy is that candidates accept a skilled worker&#39;s wage<br>for themselves. The remainder of the inflated MP&#39;s remuneration will<br>contribute to a fund to support such struggles.</p>
<p>The Workers Party is a party of workers, for workers. We are campaigning<br>for the complete freedom of movement for workers through a policy of<br>open borders, and for freedom from all anti-democratic laws such as the<br>Terrorism Suppression Act, the Electoral Finance Act and the current<br>Bill to amend the Immigration Act. The Workers Party stands for jobs for<br>all, a shorter working week and no restriction on the right to strike.<br>The Workers Party also aims for a workers&#39; republic.</p>
<p>The Workers&#39; Party intends to be registered on the party list, giving<br>every voter in the country the opportunity to vote for a party that<br>stands firmly for workers.</p>
