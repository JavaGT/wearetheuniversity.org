<p>Dr Paul Hutchison MP<br>National Party Tertiary Education Spokesman</p>

<p>Trades the loser with Labour’s new university</p>
<p>Labour’s announcement of a new university campus in South Auckland is a major blow for any potential growth in trades and polytechnic education, says National’s Tertiary Education spokesman, Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>“For two years the Government has been working on a tertiary education hub in South Auckland alongside Manukau City Council, Auckland University of Technology and Manukau Institute of Technology, as well as the Counties Manukau DHB.</p>
<p>“Everyone else involved thought Labour believed in an integrated strategy to lift skills with relevant tertiary courses, when what they have done is a deal behind closed doors in favour of a university campus.</p>
<p>“The local polytechnic, Manukau Institute of Technology, and Manukau City Council have been left high and dry.</p>
<p>“All the talk of collaboration, reducing competition, and partnership has turned out to be just talk. So has Labour’s much-promoted focus on skills and trades.</p>
<p>“When Labour has a choice, they always favour university education.</p>
<p>“The South Auckland community has made it clear they need a balance of technical and university tertiary courses, and thought that was where they were heading by working together.</p>
<p>“Labour has shafted the South Auckland community for its own political interests.</p>
<p>“This is a deal done to try to boost Labour&#39;s re-election chances and has nothing to do with the long-term needs of South Auckland and its economy.</p>
