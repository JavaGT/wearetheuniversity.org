<p>Tony Ryall MP<br>National Party Health Spokesman</p>
<p>4 July 2008</p>
<p>Yet another committee on health workforce</p>
<p>Labour has completely lost the plot with its announcement of yet another committee to deal with health workforce crisis, says National Party Health spokesman Tony Ryall</p>
<p>&quot;Setting up another committee is not going to keep any doctors in the country. In fact, the ballooning health bureaucracy is what&#39;s driving them out.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ryall is commenting after Health Minister David Cunliffe announced a new committee to deal with junior doctor ‘workforce and systems issues’ called the Resident Medical Officers Workforce Commission.</p>
<p>&quot;This demonstrates Labour has run out of ideas. All they can think of is another committee.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides over 48 workforce reports, there will now be at least eight central groups working on health workforce issues.</p>
<p>&quot;The public want action not committees.”</p>
<p>National&#39;s health discussion paper sets out a number of proposals for improving the recruitment and retention of medical staff including the smart use of bonding through student loan write-offs, and improving job satisfaction by re-engaging health professionals in the running of the health service.</p>
