<p>First business students in &#39;2+2&#39; programme arrive at Massey from Wuhan</p>
<p>The first group of business students from China&#39;s Wuhan University was welcomed to Massey&#39;s Palmerston North campus this week.</p>
<p>The 39 students, all finance majors, are part of the 2+2 Pathway Programme arranged by the two universities in 2006. The programme will involve cohorts of students from the Wuhan World Trade Organisation School studying for two years at home then move to New Zealand for two years to complete their business degrees at Massey.</p>
<p>Wuhan, in central China with a population of about 7 million, has one of the world&#39;s largest universities. About 100,000 students live on campus.</p>
<p>The Pathway Programme was developed by Massey&#39;s College of Business Associate Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Chris Moore and senior finance lecturer Dr Jing Chi. At the time Professor Moore headed the Department of Economics and Finance, a position now held by Professor Martin Young. Professor Moore, who is responsible for international and distance learning within the college, says it is an exciting development for the University that will see new cohorts arriving in the second semester each year.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a bilateral relationship with Wuhan, so there is a high level of pastoral care that the department will provide for the students. They will all live in Massey&#39;s halls of residence, at least initially, and I think many will choose to stay in the halls for the full two years.&quot;</p>
<p>They were accompanied by a full-time administrator employed by Wuhan University, WTO Studies School-Massey Programme Director Delci Wu, who will spend at least a week ensuring the students are settled in at Massey before returning to work with future cohorts.</p>

<p>The students have all completed core business papers equivalent to Massey&#39;s as well as English language papers,&quot; Professor Moore says. &quot;This gives them a truly international degree and that fits in with the WTO objective of growing international business co-operation and trade.&quot;</p>
<p>Another 60 business students are in the programme at Wuhan and those cohorts will come to Massey next year and in 2010. Professor Moore says the programme will shortly expand to include students majoring in other areas such as economics.</p>
<p>College Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Lawrence Rose welcomed the students on their first day, telling them they would be exposed to some Massey&#39;s best and brightest teaching talent. &quot;Finance is our strongest area and, as a former finance professor and finance major myself, I&#39;m very proud of that. You&#39;re in good hands here. I wish you well with your studies and look forward to seeing you all at graduation.&quot;</p>
