<p>Introducing Rahui Reid Katene<br>Maori Party candidate for Te Tai Tonga</p>
<p>Ko Tainui te waka<br>Ko Raukawa te moana<br>Ko Rangitoto te motu<br>Ko Ngati Koata, Ngati Toa, Ngati Kuia, Kai Tahu nga iwi<br>Ko John Hippolite raua ko June Kerei oku matua</p>
<p>“The people of Te Tai Tonga need an energetic, hard-working MP to give them a presence and voice in Parliament”, says Rahui Katene, Maori Party candidate for Te Tai Tonga.</p>
<p>“It’s the biggest electorate in the country which means it’s more difficult for people to access their MP than anywhere else. We need enthusiasm, care and commitment; we need change.</p>
<p>“I know so many of our whanau, hapü and iwi are struggling from not having the support, from not having someone to advocate for them at the highest levels. These are the things I want to change.</p>
<p>“I was raised in an intensely political household with a very strong work and iwi / community service ethic. The possibility of change from holding fast to our kaupapa, from speaking up and being active, was the positive energy that fuelled my father, and his cousin, Aunty Eva Rickard, in the many challenges for justice they were involved with.</p>
<p>“It’s the energy that first propelled me into the law, and now into the role as the Maori Party candidate for Te Tai Tonga.</p>
<p>“I know our parents will be cheering both Angeline Greensill (Maori Party candidate for Hauraki-Waikato) and myself on from the tupuna grandstands.</p>
<p>“The Maori Party has done a lot of work to develop policies for the people, ones that are based on a Maori kaupapa to uplift whanau, and to pave the way for justice and real prosperity.</p>
<p>“Our commitment is to ensure that tangata whenua have a proper presence at decision-making tables around the country. For government departments, agencies and service providers to really do right by the Treaty, Maori need to be there – at all levels, in all roles – with budget and policy back up.</p>
<p>“It’s about being there, and being prepared to have influence. We’re ready!”</p>
<p>Rahui Katene will be attending the Otautahi Maori Women&#39;s Refuge fund-raising dinner at the Town Hall in Christchurch tonight alongside Maori Party MP for Waiariki, Te Ururoa Flavell.</p>
