<p>Shallow sea encounters shortlisted for Montana New Zealand Book Awards</p>
<p>A book documenting the ocean&#39;s beauty just below the surface by Faculty of Engineering member Dr Iain Anderson has been selected as a finalist in the Montana New Zealand Book Awards.</p>
<p>The Surface of the Sea: Encounters with New Zealand&#39;s Upper Ocean Life (Raupo Publishing) is one of three finalists in the awards&#39; Environment 2008 category.</p>
<p>Iain is a Principal Investigator for the Bioengineering Institute and a Senior Lecturer with the Department of Engineering Science.</p>
<p>Although not a marine scientist, Iain is an avid underwater photographer and photojournalist, and is a contributing writer for Dive New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;The upper ocean is easy to visit. All you need to do is grab a mask and pair of flippers and go for a snorkel. It is the largest animal habitat on Earth,&quot; Iain says.</p>
<p>&quot;In my book I describe inhabitants of the upper ocean that I have been privileged to photograph. These include giant jelly-like plankton drifters, fish, sea turtles, sea snakes, juvenile giant squid, and the world&#39;s largest fish.&quot;</p>
<p>Most of the images in the book, which have been described as &quot;stunning&quot; and &quot;phenomenal&quot; by book reviewers, were taken in local waters around the Poor Knights Islands, the Leigh Peninsula and Auckland&#39;s west coast.</p>
<p>The Montana New Zealand Book Awards ceremony will be held on Monday 21 July at the Wellington Town Hall.</p>
