<p>PRESS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>VUWSA doubles bounty on Condy&#39;s head</p>
<p>Friday, 25 July 2008</p>
<p>The Victoria University of Wellington Students&#39; Association (VUWSA) was saddened to learn that it&#39;s fellow student association AUSA withdrew the reward for Condolezza Rice&#39;s arrest while on a visit to New Zealand.</p>
<p>VUWSA President, Joel Cosgrove said, &quot;VUWSA is willing to pay up to $10,000 for the arrest of this war criminal, and we challenge other students&#39; associations to do the right thing and front up with some money too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rice is a criminal and we expect all law abiding citizens in good conscience to pay heed to this message, and do the right thing,&quot; says Cosgrove.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike the Police, we are obliged to ensure the safety and security of the citizens of the world and we will not shirk from that task,&quot; Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel that it is within New Zealand&#39;s international obligations as a UN member state to uphold the international rule of law, and bring the perpetrators and supporters of this illegal war to justice,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard enough living as a student in New Zealand these days without having a war criminal coming to town, so we thought we&#39;d give our students a chance to make a dent in their student loans and work for global justice at the same time,&quot; said Joel Cosgrove.</p>
<p>&quot;As was aptly put by David Do, &quot;Rice is the public spokesperson for an illegal and immoral occupation that has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and the continued oppression of the people of Iraq. We believe Rice should be arrested and detained in accordance with the law and tried fairly at the International Criminal Court for her role in these war crime&quot;,&quot; noted Cosgrove.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike the AUSA reward, VUWSA will pay any student who successfully detains Rice,&quot; concluded Cosgrove</p>
