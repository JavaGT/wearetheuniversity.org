<p>A little bit of honesty please, NZUSA</p>
<p>Media release: Student Choice, 18 July 2008<br>Categories: education, tertiary education</p>
<p>The news that Labour are thinking of introducing universal student allowances is hardly a surprise to members of student group Student Choice.</p>
<p>The reaction from NZUSA that &quot;students are delighted&quot; at the news was also as predictable as it is dishonest, spokesman Mike Heine said.</p>
<p>&quot;Just because students are all forced to fund NZUSA does not mean they can make such sweeping statements on behalf of such a culturally, socially and politically diverse group of people. Every time NZUSA and other student unions claim to speak for all students they are deceiving the public and themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;Many people know that a shift to universal allowances would come at a great cost. This is money that could be used to far greater effect elsewhere - for instance, to pay higher salaries to lecturers or increase research opportunities. In much the same way as interest-free student loans (another NZUSA-backed idea) has greatly increased the amount of student debt, so will universal allowances prove to be counter-productive.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course Student Choice, unlike NZUSA, do not claim to speak for every student - the upcoming election will provide the opportunity for that. Whoever wins, we hope the next Government will realise that students do not speak with one voice and will give us the same freedom of association the rest of society enjoys&quot;, Mr Heine concluded.</p>
<p>Student Choice promotes freedom of association through voluntary membership of student associations.</p>
