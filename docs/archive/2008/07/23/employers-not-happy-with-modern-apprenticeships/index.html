<p>Employers not happy with Modern Apprenticeships</p>
<p>The depth of discontent with Labour’s handling of the Modern Apprenticeships scheme has been starkly highlighted in the latest Skills and Training survey says National’s Associate Education spokesman, Colin King.</p>
<p>The survey is commissioned annually by Business New Zealand and the Industry Training Federation. The latest survey, for 2007, was published last week.</p>
<p>“The Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) should see this survey for the wake up call it is. Labour spends millions of dollars every year on the Modern Apprenticeships scheme but employers say they have been abandoned to muddle through with no support at all.</p>
<p>“I have been pointing to the relatively poor performance of the Modern Apprenticeships scheme for three years now, and the comments from employers in this latest survey validate my concerns.</p>
<p>“Labour will spend $48 million on the Modern Apprenticeship Scheme this year which is hugely concerning when employers are making comments like; “We are training our 4th apprentice and have never received communication or visits from any support people/organisation. We feel totally on our own with apprentice training and really want to understand if we are performing adequately with our training aspects.”</p>
<p>“The Modern Apprenticeship scheme is intended to provide more focused care for young people who are entering a particular industry. Alarm bells must be ringing when employers are saying, ‘The Modern Apprenticeship co-ordinator never visits the apprentices on the afternoon and night shift… they (the apprentices) wouldn’t even know who he is.’</p>
<p>“This is just another example of wasteful spending by Labour. National values apprenticeship training and will develop flexible models that better meet the needs of employers.”</p>
