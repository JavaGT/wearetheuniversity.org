<p>Action, not cover-up, needed over Coast water quality</p>
<p>Greens Co-Leader Russel Norman says he is worried central government may put pressure on West Coast authorities to ignore a report saying 100 percent of West Coast water supplies failed to meet drinking standards.</p>
<p>&quot;After I commented on the joint document produced by the West Coast and Canterbury District Health Boards last week, the local MP and Associate Health Minister Damien O&#39;Connor has said the report &#39;shouldn&#39;t have been in the public domain in the first place&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;He seems to discount the report&#39;s main themes and hopes that if studies on water quality are out-of-sight, they will also be out-of-mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Norman said he accepted Mr O&#39;Connor&#39;s comment that the report was a draft which mixed national and regional statistics; for example it indicated a national figure of around 18,000 and 34,000 cases of gastro-intestinal disease was a regional figure, when the true number was about 110. The Greens had incorrectly used such figures in a press statement based on the report.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand these typographical and layout errors will be ironed out by the report&#39;s authors within the next six weeks or so, and then Mr O&#39;Connor must stop shutting his eyes to the message there is a major problem with Coast drinking supplies.&quot;</p>
<p>Also, the West Coast Regional Council needed to reflect on its policy of generally not prosecuting over consent breaches, despite evidence some farmers were putting profits ahead of West Coast residents&#39; health.</p>
<p>&quot;I know some water supplies are not affected by dairying and there are other causes of water pollution on the Coast, for example mining and septic tank leakage,&quot; Dr Norman said. &quot;But despite Mr O&#39;Connor saying I&#39;ve been unfair in blaming industrial dairying, the truth is the report identifies dairying expansion as a major offender in &#39;polluting... water with faecal material, nitrates and silts...&#39; &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr O&#39;Connor and regional councillors need only look at the report&#39;s map of New Zealand headed &#39;Drinking Water Quality - E. Coli&#39; to see Coasters are hard-done-by with their water supplies.&quot;</p>
