<p><strong>Tuesday, 29 July 2008, 11:34 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Otago">University of Otago</a></strong></p>
<p>Tuesday 29 July 2008</p>
<p>University appoints new Professor of Marketing</p>
<p>Professor Janet Hoek has been appointed to a Chair in Marketing at the University of Otago.</p>
<p>Professor Hoek is currently a Professor of Marketing at Massey University. She has a MA (Distinction) in early medieval literature from Massey University and received her PhD in marketing in 1996; she was made professor in 2003.</p>
<p>“I am delighted to be joining the University of Otago, which is firmly established as New Zealand’s pre-eminent university. The Department of Marketing has an excellent international reputation for high quality and innovative research and I am looking forward to extending existing research links and developing new relationships.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Hoek’s research interests are in marketing and public policy. She has developed new methods of estimating consumer deception and has acted as an expert witness in intellectual property litigation. Professor Hoek has also published widely on tobacco regulation and continues to work with the Ministry of Health, ASH (Action on Smoking and Health), the Smokefree Coalition and the New Zealand Cancer Society to promote more effective tobacco regulation.</p>
<p>Professor Hoek is a Principal Investigator in the University of Otago-based Centre for Translational Research into Chronic Disease (Obesity). She was recently appointed as an expert to assist the Health Select Committee Inquiry into Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes.</p>
<p>She received Massey’s College of Business award for research distinction in 2007 and, earlier this year, a Vice-Chancellor’s award for sustained excellence in teaching.</p>
<p>She is currently Vice President of the Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy, an organisation for educators and practitioners interested in marketing theory and research.</p>
<p>“My interests in marketing regulation complement work being undertaken in several areas of the University of Otago and I hope to develop strong cross-disciplinary research links with colleagues in public health and law.&quot;</p>
<p>University Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg says Professor Hoek’s research interests in marketing, public health and nutrition make her an ideal appointment for Otago, with its strengths in these areas.</p>
<p>“I am pleased that Professor Hoek’s research will involve collaboration between marketing and other academic departments. She has already developed such links in her current position, and I am looking forward to the synergies which could develop at Otago.&quot;</p>
<p>Otago’s Pro-Vice-Chancellor Commerce Professor George Benwell says Professor Hoek brings a strong commitment to research, particularly in marketing and public policy. “Her considerable expertise in advertising self-regulation and marketing will be a valuable addition to the School.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Hoek will take up the position in February 2009.</p>
