<p>Students campaign against rape and violence</p>
<p>Students around the country will be taking a stand against rape, violence and discrimination tomorrow when the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations re-launches its ‘Thursdays in Black’ campaign with a national day of action.</p>
<p>“Thursdays in Black invites people to wear black on Thursdays indicating their demand for a world without rape and violence. It is a peaceful protest calling for an end to discrimination based on sexual orientation, political affiliation, gender or ethnicity,” said Analiese Jackson, National Women’s Rights Officer of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).<br>‘Thursday’s in Black’ is an international human rights campaign that has historically united people who believe in the fundamental importance of respecting all human life without discrimination.</p>
<p>“This campaign focuses on ways that the individual can challenge attitudes to rape and violence.  It challenges the existing social taboos associated particularly with rape and domestic violence,&quot; said Jackson.</p>
<p>‘Thursdays in Black’ was started by groups such as Mothers for the Disappeared in Argentina, Black Sash in South Africa and the Women in Black movements in Israel-Palestine and the former Yugoslavia.  The World Council of Churches has also been involved in facilitating the campaign internationally.</p>
<p>“Wearing black on a Thursday is a gesture of solidarity for all women, men and children who are outraged by the rape and violence that happens in our communities,” added Jackson.</p>

<p>NZUSA member associations are holding a variety of events honouring victims and survivors, and calling for the eradication of all forms of rape, violence and discrimination. The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations and the Tertiary Women’s Focus Group are proud to administer this campaign in New Zealand, with all proceeds from campaign merchandise being donated to local organisations working to support survivors.</p>
