<p>Officials out of touch with New Zealanders</p>
<p>It is ridiculous that officials are backing a proposal to set up a new field trial in Canterbury of genetically engineered onions, spring onions, garlic and leeks by saying it would &quot;enhance&quot; aspects of New Zealand&#39;s reputation, says Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish some of these government advisors who are pushing New Zealand to become the world&#39;s GE laboratory, with all the risks that involves, would talk to just a few of the many ordinary New Zealanders who email and &#39;phone me urging the Greens to do all we can to keep our food-growing industry GE-free.&quot;</p>
<p>Crop and Food Research scientists are awaiting approval for the 10-year field trial and an Environmental Risk Management Authority project team has said in an interim report just issued that it considers, &quot;the benefits to be derived from the proposed field test would be; enhancing New Zealand&#39;s ability to preserve options and maintain choices, increased scientific knowledge including knowledge about environmental impacts, agronomic performance and impact... and enhanced reputation of New Zealand agricultural research&quot;.</p>
<p>Says Ms Fitzsimons; &quot;To most people, saying GE food trials would enhance our reputation in any way, especially as a producer of clean and green products, would be like saying nuclear warship visits could do likewise.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than &#39;preserving options and maintaining choices&#39; we are heading down a route that will seriously restrict the choices of growers who wish to satisfy their markets that their products are totally GE-free, and eventually deny choice to New Zealand consumers who want certainty their food is uncontaminated.</p>

<p>&quot;Significantly this test takes the risk to new levels by allowing a small number of onion plants in the field to flower and set seed within special cages, rather than preventing GE plants from reproducing as in previous trials.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike the Greens, and most New Zealanders, the Government doesn&#39;t care whether we are GE-free or not and with each new trial, the risk of accidents is increased and so is the risk to our international image.&quot;</p>
