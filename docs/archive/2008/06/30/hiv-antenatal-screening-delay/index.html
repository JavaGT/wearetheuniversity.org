<p><strong>Monday, 30 June 2008, 10:58 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Jackie Blue MP<br>National Party Associate Health Spokeswoman</p>
<p>29 June 2008</p>
<p>HIV antenatal screening delay another broken promise</p>
<p>News that the full roll-out of the antenatal HIV screening programme will be delayed by up to a year is unacceptable, says National Party Associate Health spokeswoman Jackie Blue.</p>
<p>“Announced in June 2005, the roll-out to all DHBs was to be completed by June this year, but the fact is that only two DHBs, Waikato and Tairawhiti, are currently offering screening to pregnant women.</p>
<p>“Twelve other DHBs will hopefully be on board by the end of the year, with the final seven DHBs by June 2009.</p>
<p>“This is just another broken promise by Labour.”</p>
<p>Dr Blue says that since 2001, 12 children born in New Zealand have been diagnosed with HIV infection.</p>
<p>“With early detection of HIV in pregnancy, the chances of delivering an HIV negative baby, and ensuring the best health outcomes for both, are greatly improved.</p>
<p>“The Waikato DHB, the first to offer screening as part of a pilot study, has proved that this test has been welcomed by women. Any teething problems with the screening should be well and truly sorted out.</p>
<p>“Labour launched the HIV/AIDS ‘Action Plan’ in 2003 with antenatal HIV testing one of its goals. However, ‘inaction’ would seem to be a better description.”</p>
