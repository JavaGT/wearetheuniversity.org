<p>Experts Illuminating Topical Issues</p>
<p>Sustainability, racial problems in the United States, and the &quot;War on Terror&quot; are among topical matters being aired at the Centre for Continuing Education&#39;s Winter Week on Campus.</p>
<p>University of Auckland academics who are expert in their field and passionate about teaching adults will be offering the popular annual programme from July 7 to 11.</p>
<p>Those attending need no experience of university study, simply a love of learning and an interest in the key issues of our time.</p>
<p>The sessions on &quot;Making your Vote Count&quot;, for example, provide a detailed rundown of how New Zealand&#39;s political system works as well as the role of the media and opinion polls.</p>
<p>Another stream of lectures gives a brief historical perspective of the United States from its democratic foundation to the race problem, foreign affairs and events post-2001.</p>
<p>&quot;Engineering Today&quot; covers not only sustainability but also such aspects as green roofs, replacing bone joints, and food properties.</p>
<p>In &quot;Legal Issues&quot; Scott Optican and colleagues from the Law School will discuss questions including disclosure of previous convictions, admissibility of illegally obtained evidence, and the law of shipwreck.</p>
<p>There is a lecture series on &quot;Philosophy of Religion and the Problem of Evil&quot; and another entitled &quot;Music Matters&quot; to help develop and enhance musical appreciation.</p>
<p>Three sessions, each with a choice of two lecture options, will be run each day.
