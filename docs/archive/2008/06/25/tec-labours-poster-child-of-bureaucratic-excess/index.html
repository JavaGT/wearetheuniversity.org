<p><strong>Wednesday, 25 June 2008, 3:47 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Dr Paul Hutchison MP National Party Tertiary Education Spokesman</p>
<p>25 June 2008</p>
<p>TEC - Labour&#39;s poster child of bureaucratic excess</p>
<p>The Tertiary Education Commission&#39;s appetite for excess knows no bounds, says Nationals&#39; Tertiary Education spokesman Paul Hutchison on learning that the departing CEO will be rewarded with a performance bonus.</p>
<p>Today it was confirmed that Janice Shiner&#39;s performance bonus would be between $40,000 and $41,000 even though she is shortly leaving New Zealand and will not remain accountable for the changes she has made.</p>
<p>&quot;The TEC continues to gorge itself on more bureaucrats, consultants, and contractors. Last year it spent 300% more than it estimated on contractors and consultants, so this year it has simply trebled its budget.</p>
<p>&quot;In just four years, since its establishment in 2004, the TEC has burgeoned to 287 full-time employees and a further 19 who are part-time.</p>
<p>&quot;Today the Minister confirmed that TEC&#39;s new structure could have 341 full-time employees, but said they hadn&#39;t finished hiring staff.</p>
<p>&quot;In 2007 there was a 69% rise in TEC bureaucrats earning over $100,000, and in 2008 a 16% rise.</p>
<p>&quot;The constant reforms of this sector will be remembered not for any improved efficiency but for reckless waste. The 2008 Budget fuels the situation by increasing the operational funding by a huge 37%.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s record of building massive wasteful bureaucracies is without precedent.</p>
<p>&quot;The TEC is its poster child.&quot;</p>
