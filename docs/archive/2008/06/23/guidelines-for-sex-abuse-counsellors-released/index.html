<p>Monday, June 23, 2008<br>Guidelines for sex abuse counsellors released</p>
<p>New guidelines for the treatment of survivors of sexual abuse, developed by Massey University psychologists, have been released today.</p>
<p>Sexual Abuse and Mental Injury: Practice Guidelines for Aotearoa New Zealand was commissioned by the Accident Compensation Corporation. The corporation provides counselling and sometimes compensation to people who have been sexually abused.</p>
<p>The Director of the University’s Psychology Clinic, Cheryl Woolley, says the guidelines will be a practical reference tool based on best practice principles.</p>
<p>“The guidelines are important because practitioners from a number of disciplines counsel survivors of sexual abuse,” Mrs Woolley says.</p>
<p>“Counsellors, psychotherapists, social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists are all involved. It’s not an academic tome, but rather a product designed to help practitioners make decisions in the context of daily practice.”</p>
<p>The guidelines include sections on working with victims of all ages and cultures.</p>
<p>Mrs Woolley says the guidelines went through a rigorous peer review process by international and national experts.</p>
<p>Mrs Woolley and her team, along with representatives from ACC, are embarking this week on a national road show to introduce and discuss the guidelines with counsellors. They will visit Auckland, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington and Christchurch during the week.</p>
