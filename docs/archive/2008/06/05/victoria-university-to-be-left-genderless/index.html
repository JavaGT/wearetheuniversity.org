<p>Press Release: For Immediate Relase</p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington to be left genderless?</p>
<p>Students plan to protest tomorrow morning against proposed cuts to Gender and Women’s Studies (GWS) at Victoria University.</p>
<p>Victoria University Students’ Association’s Women’s Rights Officer, Georgina Dickson stated, “This is a travesty, the University is undermining Gender and Women’s Studies, and effectively threatening to close the school down.”</p>
<p>Dickson added, “The proposed changes are entirely unreasonable, and we as students will not tolerate these incessant attacks from the University.”</p>
<p>A consultation document recently released by the University proposes, as part of a new structure for the College of Education, to restrict 300-level and BA Honours courses to a minimum of 16 enrolments, as well as limiting the time GWS lecturers spend teaching GWS, and moving them outside their field of academic specialty.</p>
<p>Dickson says, “The University justifies these proposals, claiming that funding models are to blame for the under resourcing of small departments, such as GWS. However, GWS has the largest proportion of PhD enrolments in the University”</p>
<p>The protest will take place at 8.40 am, Thursday the 5th of June, in the Council Chambers during the Academic Board Meeting.</p>
