<p>Inner City residents meeting highlights important issues</p>
<p>A public meeting held last night for inner city residents in Wellington highlighted a number of important issues facing those who live in the central city.</p>
<p>“As the population in the inner city grows, so do the issues and challenges for those who live there. The meeting discussed everything from resource consents and availability of green space to pets and parking”, said Grant Robertson, Labour candidate for Wellington Central, and meeting organiser.</p>
<p>Around 20 inner city residents attended the meeting and, as well as discussing local issues, heard from a representative of the neighbouring Mt Victoria Residents Association, and the three Lambton Ward Councillors.</p>
<p>“The issues raised include many that the Council is currently working on, so there will be a number of opportunities to take them further. The meeting also highlighted positive initiatives that people in the inner city would like to see. There was a call to develop a sense of community and neighbourhood in the area, which is exactly the role a residents association could play”, Grant said.</p>
<p>The next step will be for those who are interested to meet again to discuss the issues that were raised in more depth, and look at how to formalise the network.</p>
<p>“The structure and nature of an inner city residents group will be unique, and it will take some time to evolve, but there is plenty of enthusiasm to look at the issues further, both from those who attended the meeting and others who have contacted me who were not able to be there.” Grant said.</p>
<p>Any inner city residents wishing to be a part of on-going meetings and discussions should contact grant[at]grantrobertson.co.nz</p>
