<p>Secure healthcare</p>
<p>Something is clearly wrong when the Government has doubled expenditure on health but hospitals are spiralling into deficit even through the Government promised not to let that happen.</p>
<p>Buried in the fine print of last month&#39;s Budget is the revelation that nine of the country&#39;s DHBs are expecting to run up huge deficits in the next financial year: Auckland, Counties Manukau, Tairawhiti, Hawke&#39;s Bay, Whanganui, Capital and Coast, West Coast, Otago, and Southland.</p>
<p>Apparently there is a $24 million deficit at Wellington&#39;s Capital and Coast DHB - more than double what was expected. Last week, Hutt Valley DHB admitted to a possible $6 million to $9 million deficit after planning to break even.</p>
<p>Southland&#39;s deficit has jumped to more than $6 million. MidCentral&#39;s deficit is expected to be over $7 million - four times the original estimate.</p>
<p>The response of Finance Minister Michael Cullen is that &quot;cost containment strategies&quot; are being put in place. It is not clear what that means in the context of sick or injured people.</p>
<p>Ironically, Helen Clark campaigned in Opposition on a promise that &#39;the deficit funding of the public health sector has to stop. We should fund a balanced budget for our public health services - not a deficit budget&#39;.</p>
<p>The New Zealand political economy</p>
<p>This month, Kerry McDonald, a well-known professional company director who was previously the director of the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research and then Managing Director of Colmaco, gave his insights in a published paper which was sub-titled &quot;Ineffective policies, lost opportunities; miserable results and serious risks&quot;.</p>
<p>It is a devastating indictment of the Labour-led Government and looks at a range of key performance indicators and key issues.</p>
<p>His comments include that an NZIER analysis of the Government&#39;s recent report Economic Development Indicators 2007 concludes: the 24 underlying determinants of New Zealand&#39;s living standards are &quot;heavily clustered&quot; in the &quot;low&quot; and &quot;deteriorating&quot; performance ratings. Twelve were rated low, 10 medium, and 2 high. In addition, 13 were deteriorating, 2 steady, and 9 improving.</p>
<p>Productivity is &quot;low and deteriorating&quot;, and its growth has been at or below benchmark countries since 1980. New Zealand was also &quot;low and deteriorating&quot; in savings, international trade, outward foreign direct investment, management skills, exchange rate, balance of payments, and net foreign assets. The tax system was &quot;deteriorating&quot; as the rest of the world has been steadily reducing tax rates and New Zealand&#39;s share of total taxes from personal and corporate income is high! That is a woeful picture.</p>
<p>A referendum on MMP</p>
<p>When MMP was introduced we all believed there would be a further referendum. Not so. The plan was only to conduct a review that was conducted by a parliamentary committee dominated by minor party representatives.</p>
<p>The result, of course, was a foregone conclusion. The cynic would say that &quot;turkeys don&#39;t vote for an early Christmas&quot;. These ones proved the strength of that aphorism.</p>
<p>If National wins the next election it has promised a referendum on MMP. That is not to say that some form of proportional representation would not be inappropriate but that it just might not be MMP.</p>

<p>Political Quote of the Week</p>
<p>&quot;A vision is not a vision unless it says yes to some ideas and no to others, inspires people and is a reason to get out of bed in the morning and come to work&quot; - Gilford Pinchot - American conservationist and public official, was chiefly responsible for introducing scientific forestry to the United States (1865-1946)</p>
