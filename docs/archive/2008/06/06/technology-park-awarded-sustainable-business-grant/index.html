<p>AUT Technology Park awarded grant to lead SMEs in sustainable business</p>
<p>AUT Technology Park has been awarded a $14,000 grant through the Shell NZ Sustainability Fund.</p>
<p>The business incubator will use its grant to take a leadership role in sustainability by measuring its carbon footprint and then passing on the knowledge, tools and insights to other SMEs to encourage further expansion of the program.</p>
<p>AUT Technology Park chief executive officer Jonathan Kirkpatrick says as an incubator it has the potential to influence other businesses in their approach to sustainability.</p>
<p>&quot;We wish to be seen as a positive influence and contributor to the protection and maintenance of our environment. As a business incubator and commercialisation environment focussed on start up business with high growth potential we can influence practice through the introduction of sustainability processes for ourselves and our companies.&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>Shell has devised the funding programme to support the development of initiatives that can be act us models for businesses throughout New Zealand.</p>
<p>The 300,000 small and medium sized businesses in New Zealand have an important role to play in reducing our carbon footprint. However, in many cases these businesses either lack expertise, or the time and resources, to tackle the issue.</p>
<p>The judging panel for the Shell grants consists of senior representatives from the New Zealand Business Council for Sustainable Development, Ministry for the Environment and Shell New Zealand.</p>
