<p>Boards of trustees abandoned in hours of need</p>
<p>Imperilled boards of trustees are waiting years for help from the Ministry of Education because staff have been given no guidance on when to intervene, says National&#39;s Education spokeswoman, Anne Tolley.</p>
<p>An Auditor-General&#39;s report tabled in Parliament yesterday cites examples of schools waiting years after being identified as being in trouble, before a statutory manager was brought in to help out.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry has available all the information it needs to assess whether schools need intervention, but they have no written policies or procedures on how to use that information.</p>
<p>&quot;The welfare and educational performance of students is being put at unnecessary and unacceptable risk.</p>
<p>&quot;In one example quoted in the report, it took three-and-a-half years from when problems with teacher quality and student achievement were first recognised by ERO for support to be provided by the Ministry.</p>
<p>&quot;In another example, a school was recognised as being in trouble in 2002 and it wasn&#39;t until 2007 that a statutory manager was appointed.</p>
<p>&quot;These are not isolated problems. The Auditor-General points out that 7% of ERO reports suggest there are big problems, but statutory intervention is happening in only half of those cases.</p>
<p>&quot;Boards of trustees must be supported because they are the life support system for the school and students. If boards are in trouble, the consequences down the line are dire.</p>
<p>&quot;Education Minister Chris Carter must address the concerns raised by the Auditor General as a matter of priority.&quot;</p>
