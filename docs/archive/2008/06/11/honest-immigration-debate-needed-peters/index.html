<p>Honest Immigration Debate Needed – Peters</p>
<p>New Zealand First has called for an honest and open debate on immigration and for a sensible population policy that takes full account of the country’s resources and future economic direction.</p>
<p>Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters said recent extreme statements on both sides of the immigration issue showed that officials implementing policy and academics were floundering around without clear direction.</p>
<p>For example, an immigration conference in Wellington was given an outrageous claim that an immigrant can be four times as valuable to the economy as a New Zealander.</p>
<p>It was claimed that each immigrant makes an annual net impact of $3547 against $915 for a New Zealand born individual. Mr Peters described this statement as “moronic”.</p>
<p>“The conference was clearly fed some ridiculous nonsense that is contradicted by the Labour Department’s briefing papers to past ministers.</p>
<p>“There have been huge costs associated with the influx of immigrants over the past two decades. The costs are linked to infrastructure, education, health and social services.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mr Peters said he was extremely wary of a recent academic paper that claimed an underclass of crime-ridden Pacific Islanders was developing.</p>
<p>“It is time to take stock of who we are and what we want to be. We need to look at ourselves and decide whether we are a Pacific nation, part of Asia or wish to retain our uniqueness as New Zealanders shaped by our colonial history.</p>
<p>“It is time for an honest discussion about immigration, not some one-sided cheerleading excuse for policy failure,” said Mr Peters.</p>
