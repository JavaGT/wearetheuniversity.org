<p>More hold-ups with Project Protector roll-out</p>
<p>National Party Defence spokesman Wayne Mapp says Labour&#39;s roll-out of new equipment for our armed services continues to be plagued by problems.</p>
<p>&quot;There are now problems with three ships in the Project Protector fleet - the Canterbury, the Rotoiti, and the Otago.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Mapp is commenting on the latest glitch to hit the Canterbury, which was due to have left the country on Monday for training in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The Navy has announced that the Canterbury will now carry out those activities in New Zealand waters while it sorts out problems with its inflatable-boat launch system.</p>
<p>&quot;Less than a fortnight ago, it was revealed that the HMNZS Rotoiti, an in-shore patrol ship, failed to gain Lloyds certification because it didn&#39;t meet all safety requirements.</p>
<p>&quot;Lloyd&#39;s identified a raft of problems, including a lack of basic fire safety and insulation measures.</p>
<p>&quot;The HMNZS Otago has also failed a basic safety test. Lloyd&#39;s has refused to give that ship certification, too.</p>
<p>&quot;It keeps getting worse for the Defence Minister. The Canterbury is the only one of these three vessels which has actually made it into service.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears Labour has taken shortcuts with its navy acquisitions, and the Government&#39;s self-imposed rushed deadlines, are compromising the safety of the ships and those who serve on them.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the soon-to-be-released Auditor General&#39;s report into the Project Protector, contract under which all these ships were purchased, will make for grim reading.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has overseen Defence Force projects that have been riddled with problems, and it needs to answer serious questions about why things have gone so badly wrong.&quot;</p>
