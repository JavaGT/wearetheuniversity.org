<p>Maori Party to campaign vigorously for party and electorate votes</p>
<p>Maori Party Press release from Hon Tariana Turia<br>Co-leader of the Maori Party<br>Tuesday 3 June 2008</p>
<p>“The Maori Party will campaign vigorously for the party vote in &#39;08 as we did in &#39;05, says Co-leader Tariana Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;Our mandate to lead the nation on the basis of our foundation principles comes from all of Aotearoa, as well as the specific electorates we will stand in” she said.</p>
<p>She said that comments reported from the Green Party AGM in Auckland this last weekend have come as a surprise.</p>
<p>The comments attributed to Greens Party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons suggested that a deal had been struck with the Māori Party to encourage their supporters to give their party votes to the Greens.</p>
<p>“Just to put the record straight, there are no such arrangements in place” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“We want to work constructively in Parliament using the mandate we get from both votes, the party vote and the electorate vote”.</p>
<p>&quot;Many Pakeha, Pasifika and Asian people are telling us they plan to give their party vote to the Maori Party, even though they are in General electorates”.</p>
<p>“We are building for the long term future, not just a three year election term” said Mrs Turia. “That sort of thinking limits political strategy to three year opportunism”.</p>
<p>“Why would we not trust in ourselves?” asked Mrs Turia. “Our people are here for the long haul, for the future of Aotearoa”.</p>
<p>“We absolutely believe that the aspirations of tangata whenua are closely aligned to the aspirations of the nation”.</p>

<p>&quot;The heartfelt message of our supporters is that Aotearoa is in need of a change, a change for the better - and they are going to &#39;Vote Maori Party for a change&#39;,” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>The Māori Party are currently taking part in a roadshow across the electorate of Tamaki Makaurau. The schedule for today includes hui at:<br>• Ngā Whare Waatea marae, 9-11am;<br>• Te Wānanga o Aotearoa, Mangere, 11-12pm<br>• Te Wānanga o Takiura, 1-3pm<br>• Waipapa Marae, Auckland University, 3.30pm-5pm</p>
