<p>Victoria managing swine flu cases<br>Molly McCarthy</p>
<p>Recent reports suggesting swine flu was spreading through student hostels were swiftly rebutted by Victoria University, who stressed the situation was being carefully managed.</p>
<p>As of 16 July there have only been seven confirmed cases of H1N1 Influenza in Victoria’s halls of residence.</p>
<p>The university has over 2700 students in nine halls of residence, and since 1 June until 20 July, Victoria has recorded 40 suspected cases of H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Of those 40 students, 16 students have tested positive for swine flu, three have tested negative and we have had 21 suspected cases.</p>
<p>Victoria’s Director of Student Services Ruth Moorehouse said that because testing was only being conducted in certain cases, the university could not confirm the numbers of students with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>“The university is working closely with staff from Regional Public Health to ensure we are taking all the necessary precautions,” Moorehouse said.</p>
<p>The university and its halls of residence have had a pandemic plan in place to ensure all suspected cases are carefully managed to avoid the virus’ spread.</p>
<p>In a number of halls this plan has included isolating students with flu-like symptoms and providing anti-bacterial hand gel.</p>
<p>One hall of residence, Weir House, isolated a small number of residents, providing them with face masks, isolated bathrooms and meals served to their rooms. One resident described the experience as “like a holiday, except you’re really tired”, but others were less impressed with the service provided by the hall staff.</p>

<p>Latest protocol advises students and staff to only isolate themselves if they are feeling ill, not simply if they have been in contact with someone with swine flu.</p>
<p>Victoria has established Pandemic Management Committee, which is constantly monitoring the situation and responding accordingly.</p>
<p>Practical steps to avoiding spread of the virus include basic hand hygiene and covering coughs and sneezes. Regularly updated information can be accessed via a link on the Victoria University homepage.</p>
<p>Most of these cases remain unconfirmed however, and few were provided with Tamiflu. The spread of the virus had also appeared to have died down since the initial cases.</p>
<p>New Zealand has over 1000 recorded cases of the H1N1 virus. There have been 94,512 reported cases of swine flu worldwide, with over 420 deaths.</p>
<p>Statistics from the Ministry of Health say that there over 47,000 cases of seasonal flu in New Zealand in 2008.</p>
<p>In the US, an estimated 25–50 million cases of seasonal flu are currently reported each year, leading to 150,000 hospitalisations and 30,000–40,000 deaths yearly.</p>
