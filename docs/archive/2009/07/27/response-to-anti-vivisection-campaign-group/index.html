<p><strong>Monday, 27 July 2009, 12:28 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University">Massey University</a></strong></p>
<p>Response to anti-vivisection campaign group statement</p>
<p>Claims by the group National Anti-vivisection Campaign that I am involved in cruel animal experiments at Massey University are completely untrue.</p>
<p>My role as manager of Massey&#39;s Manawatu campus small animal facilities, where I have worked for the past 15 years, involves caring for small animals – invariably rats but occasionally mice and rabbits – and the facilities in which research and teaching is conducted.</p>
<p>The teaching involves Massey University veterinary science students learning to handle small animals, which are increasingly popular as pets and therefore more likely to be encountered by those who work at veterinary clinics after graduation.</p>
<p>The research involves nutritional studies by internal and external clients. These do not involve the use of toxins or poisons or any form of cosmetic testing. The research is done to improve human understanding of diet and health. All the activities at the facilities comply with national animal welfare standards and every research project conducted has approval from the University&#39;s animal ethics committee.</p>
<p>I am not involved in cruel animal experiments and would not work at Massey if the types of activities suggested by the anti-vivisection campaign group were occurring there.</p>
<p>I have spent much of the past eight years in a voluntary position for the Manawatu SPCA working for the welfare of animals. There is no connection between what I do with the SPCA or Massey, and no conflict of interest either.</p>

<p>In both roles I feel it is my responsibility to ensure that all animals – whether pets, livestock or those used in legitimate scientific teaching and research – are treated humanely</p>
<p>If members of the anti-vivisection campaign are genuine in their concern for animal welfare and wish to assist the SPCA they are most welcome to join the organisation and seek membership of the committee that has elected me as chairperson. Then they would get a real understanding of the work done by our staff and volunteers like myself to assist in the welfare of animals and education of the public.</p>
