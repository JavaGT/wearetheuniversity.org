<p><strong>Tuesday, 21 July 2009, 9:16 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>John Key misses the point</p>
<p>John Key’s attack on recession recovery policies announced today to assist unemployed Kiwis is typical Key sleight of hand, Labour Social Development Spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“John Key has dismissed Labour’s recession policy removing the spousal income test for a person in a dual-income family losing their job as welfare for the rich – citing households where one person earns $200,000.</p>
<p>“This, conveniently, misses the point. John Key should get real. How many Kiwis earn over $200,000?,” Mrs King said.</p>
<p>“John Key is putting up a straw man. Let’s look at the facts. If every person earning over $150,000 was thrown out of work tomorrow this would account for 37,000 people out of the around 2 million in the workforce.</p>
<p>“Labour’s plan, to apply until the economy recovers, actually targets the growing number of low and middle income Kiwi families which, through the loss of one income, are struggling to pay the mortgage and the food bills.</p>
<p>“The average household income in New Zealand is $66,092, a far cry from the type of household John Key clearly thinks about.</p>
<p>“With unemployment numbers forecast to rise to180,000 next year, many hardworking Kiwi families are facing hard times. Labour believes that families would welcome this temporary assistance.</p>
<p>“Labour’s policy fills the void left by National’s do-nothing, hope for the best approach. Rather than spending time practising his one liners, John Key would be of more use to New Zealanders if he actually came up with an idea,” Annette King said.</p>
