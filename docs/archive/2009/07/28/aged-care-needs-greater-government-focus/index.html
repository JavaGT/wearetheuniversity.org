<p>Hon Luamanuvao Winnie Laban<br><strong>Associate Health Spokesperson (aged care)</strong></p>
<p>28 July 2009 **Media Statement<br>**<br><strong>Aged care needs greater Government focus</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand’s elderly deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, which is why earlier this year I proposed that MPs hold an inquiry into elderly care in this country, Associate Health Spokesperson Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.</p>
<p>“Abuse in any form is not acceptable. The recent court case where a care giver was charged for putting tape over an elderly woman&#39;s mouth in a rest home is an outrage and a reminder to us all to be vigilant around ensuring safety for our elders who for many are our parents, grandparents and great grandparents,” Winnie Laban said.</p>
<p>“Sentencing decisions are a matter for judges, but this case has sent a clear message to those living in rest homes, their families and the people who work in the homes.</p>
<p>“Last month I sought a Health Select Committee inquiry into aged care, to ensure that older New Zealanders were receiving the appropriate access to health services both in the community and in residential care.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately the National Party voted against holding the inquiry.</p>
<p>“There are currently around 28,000 older New Zealanders living in aged residential care and a further 60,000 older people receive home support services.</p>
<p>“It is extremely important that we ensure we are doing everything possible to meet the needs of these people.</p>
<p>“Already the Otago DHB has signalled that it is looking at cutting home support services to make financial savings.</p>
<p>“An inquiry would have ensured Government funding which is in excess of $700 million a year was being targeted to the right services and that elderly were receiving the most appropriate health services at the right time,” Winnie Laban said.</p>
