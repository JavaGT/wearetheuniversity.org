<p><strong>DIMMER – ALBUM RELEASE SHOW</strong><br>Saturday 18 July – Bar Bodega - $20 presales <a href="http://www.undertheradar.co.nz">www.undertheradar.co.nz</a></p>
<p>DIMMER</p>
<p>Shayne Carter has been in the studio for over a year working on the follow-up to Dimmer’s acclaimed third album There My Dear and the result is one of the most potent recordings of his remarkable career, Degrees of Existence, due for release at the end of July.</p>
<p>Preceded by the snarling melodic brilliance of the singles “Degrees of Existence” and “Cold Water”, the latter currently searing across the airwaves, this Dimmer album promises to meet the exacting standards of one of the finest New Zealand groups of recent times.</p>
<p>Joining him onstage will be James Duncan (Punches, SJD), Kelly Steven (Punches) and Gary Sullivan, the latter recently returned to the Dimmer fold having first occupied the band’s drumstool almost a decade ago, bringing his always tasteful and sinuous grooves to the ongoing Dimmer project, adding a fresh element to the sonic pop explorations of Carter and Duncan’s brilliant guitarwork.</p>
