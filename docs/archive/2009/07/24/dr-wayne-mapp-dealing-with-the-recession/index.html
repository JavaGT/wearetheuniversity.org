<p>24 July 2009<br>Dealing With The Recession</p>
<p>The recession is having a considerable impact on most New Zealanders. Because it has a global origin, the Government cannot simply make it go away by spending money. However, we have done much to take the sharpest edges off. Doing that calls for a careful balancing act. That is why the Budget delivered on National’s pre-election commitments, but we have taken particular care not to let debt spiral ever upward.</p>
<p>The Government is working on three key long-term objectives to boost economic growth: increasing New Zealand&#39;s productivity growth, maintaining high levels of employment, and reducing New Zealand&#39;s vulnerability to adverse events.</p>
<p>New Zealand has many economic advantages. We are experts at food production. We are close to the emerging centres of growth in Asia. Tourists want to come here and see our beautiful scenery. Ultra-fast broadband is a breakthrough technology that will give our firms the ability to reach customers around the world.</p>
<p>To make the most of these advantages, we need an environment where the private sector can thrive. We are working on six main policy drivers to help create that environment and lift our economic performance. They are:</p>
<p>• regulatory reform<br>• investment in infrastructure<br>• better public services<br>• education and skills<br>• innovation and business assistance<br>• a world-class tax system.<br>•</p>
<p>Getting A Good Start</p>
<p>It is important that children get a good start in education. The Government is now helping more families to access early childhood education.</p>

<p>We are increasing funding for early childhood education providers. This brings the early childhood sector into line with school and tertiary education funding increases announced in the Budget. This is part of a $1.1 billion investment by National into early childhood education this year.</p>
<p>National has also delivered on its promise to extend 20 hours ECE to five-year-olds, playcentres and all kōhanga reo, increasing the choices available for parents. This will be in place from 1 July next year. From 1 July, 2011, the six-hour daily limit will be removed.</p>
<p>We have also introduced changes that are designed to keep our children’s health and safety in mind as well as reducing bureaucratic requirements on ECE centres. These changes follow consultation with the sector and parents.</p>
<p>Improving Health Services</p>
<p>The Government is committed to delivering effective frontline health services. That is why we have freed up DHBs to make smarter use of private hospitals.</p>
<p>DHBs can now enter into longer-term arrangements with private hospitals to ensure they best meet the needs of our communities. This will be of particular value in North Shore</p>
<p>These changes will save money and reduce patient waiting times, especially for non-urgent operations.</p>
<p>National has already announced that it will build 20 extra dedicated elective surgery operating theatres, and train extra nurses and doctors in the public sector to staff them.</p>
<p>Defence Review</p>
<p>The Defence Review 09 Public Consultation Document ( <a href="http://www.defence.govt.nz/reports-publications/review09-public-consultation/contents.html">http://www.defence.govt.nz/reports-publications/review09-public-consultation/contents.html</a> )</p>
<p>was launched at the end of June. This Review will provide the platform for defence policy which will support New Zealand’s security in the coming decades. I encourage you to express your views. The Government needs wide input on the major Defence issues we must address. Make your views known using the online submission form available at <a href="http://www.defence.govt.nz/">www.defence.govt.nz</a>. The deadline is 24 August.</p>
<p>Out And About</p>
<p>I visited the Waiouru and Linton Army camps, and the Ohakea and Woodbourne Air Force bases over the past fortnight. Each of the armed services has its own structure, culture and operational imperatives and the visits gave me valuable insights into how they work. I enjoyed meeting a large number of service people in their workplaces and hearing about their jobs.</p>
<p>Each of them is making a valuable contribution to New Zealand’s defence. Contemporary expectations mean that more service people have served New Zealand on overseas deployments.</p>
