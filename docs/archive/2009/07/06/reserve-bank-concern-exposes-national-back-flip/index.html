<p><strong>Monday, 6 July 2009, 4:43 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Reserve Bank concern exposes National ‘back-flip’ on inquiry</strong></p>
<p>The Reserve Bank’s continuing concern at the level of interest banks are charging on floating rate mortgages shows just how wrong it was for National to muzzle a parliamentary inquiry into bank profits, says Labour finance spokesperson David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>David Cunliffe said the Reserve Bank, in an analysis of interest rate margins, said today that the pricing of floating rate mortgages appeared &quot;unusually&quot; high in recent months.</p>
<p>“The Reserve Bank said in its statement that it believes there is some scope for further reductions in these rates without compromising the viability of this lending.”</p>
<p>David Cunliffe said the Reserve Bank’s concerns underlined the need for the inquiry that National had torpedoed.</p>
<p>“National, with help from the Maori Party and ACT, effectively muzzled the inquiry by Parliament’s watchdog finance and expenditure select committee.</p>
<p>&quot;Thousands of New Zealand homeowners, businesses, farmers and exporters have every reason to ask why,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They are paying too much for their mortgages and business loans, and they&#39;ve now been denied the opportunity to find out why in a parliamentary forum.&quot;</p>
