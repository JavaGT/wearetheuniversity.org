<p>2 July 2009<br>Media Statement</p>
<p>Minister abandons Maori students</p>
<p>Maori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples sent the clearest message today to those secondary schools struggling to raise Maori student achievement that they are on their own and cannot rely on the Government to help them out, says Labour’s spokesperson for Maori Education Kelvin Davis.</p>
<p>“Maori students have been abandoned by their Minister.”</p>
<p>“Speaking on behalf of the Minister, Gerry Brownlee said today in the House that he stood by his comments that ‘if secondary schools will not step up and deal with that problem then we go elsewhere, such as universities to deal with it’,” Kelvin Davis says.</p>
<p>“The Minister should know that shifting a problem doesn’t fix a problem. This response signals that after just eight months in Government, Dr Sharples has given up on Maori students in secondary schools. He is devoid of ideas.</p>
<p>“When asked to articulate his solutions to Maori student underachievement, not one was offered, other than to blame schools and tell them to sort themselves out. This was Pita Sharples’ opportunity to demonstrate to Maori that he was a leader with a plan, but he failed.</p>
<p>“As a former teacher, I can only imagine how gutted some school staff and Boards of Trustees must be feeling, knowing that despite their best efforts, there is no sign of support coming their way. Struggling schools know they are struggling. Telling them to work harder won’t make them any more successful. Those schools need help,” Kelvin Davis says.</p>

<p>“When asked in select committee last week about the research base he referred to when making decisions about Maori education, Dr Sharples sadly replied that he based his decisions on his own experiences at university, being on a Board of Trustees and talking to a few mates.</p>
<p>“Using the same illogical reasoning, anyone who has flown on a few planes, had a conversation with a pilot and eaten in the Koru Club, should be about ready to fly a plane,” Kelvin Davis said.</p>
<p>“Surely the Minister’s job is to create the conditions where the people they lead can do their job to the best of their ability – not just abandon them when they need help. That’s not the Maori way. I deplore a school that gives up on its students, just as I’m deeply disappointed by a Minister who gives up on those he leads.”</p>
