<p>Swine Flu Spreading Through Student Hostels</p>
<p>• 3 New suspected cases in the last 48 hours</p>
<p>• Allegations of unhygienic conditions</p>

<p>The Capital’s largest University is under fire from students following an outbreak of suspected swine flu cases and allegations of unhygienic and cramped living conditions.</p>
<p>Student hostels owned by Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) admit that three suspected swine flu cases have been reported in the last 48 hours, prompting a late night meeting on Tuesday amongst the University’s residential advisors.</p>
<p>The news comes just weeks after two students, who were both confirmed to have the virus, were quarantined for up to 72 hours at Helen Lawry Hall in Karori.</p>
<p>The three latest suspected cases, two of which are from Helen Lawry Hall, are currently seeking medical advice and being urged to steer clear of fellow students.</p>
<p>Victoria University Students’ Association Welfare Vice President, Seamus Brady, says he has received several complaints from students about the state of Helen Lawry Hall.</p>
<p>“I’m concerned about the conditions that students of the [Helen Lawry] hall are living in. Students are genuinely worried about the damp and mouldy walls, ceilings and floors,” Brady said.</p>
<p>At least 6 students were treated at Victoria’s Health Clinic in Kelburn today after presenting to medical staff with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>The Victoria University Communications team today failed to respond to media enquiries.</p>
