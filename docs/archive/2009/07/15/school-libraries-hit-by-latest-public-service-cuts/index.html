<p>School libraries hit by latest public service cuts</p>
<p>School children in New Zealand’s regions are the latest to suffer from National’s broken promises of capping public service jobs and moving staff to the frontline, Labour State Services spokesperson Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>“14 jobs around New Zealand have been cut by the National Library. Those staff provided support to school libraries,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>“School libraries offer vital services for students learning and the evidence suggests many schools in the regions rely heavily on the support the local National Library staffer offered.</p>
<p>“Many schools in remote areas were alarmed when they heard of the possibility of National Library staffing cuts and lobbied management, for the sake of their children, for a rethink.”</p>
<p>A letter sent to Ministers and MPs from three central North Island school librarians says the move is a backwards step. It goes on to say;</p>
<p>“The need for professionally staffed, well resourced school libraries is ever-increasing. The Ministry of Education’s emphasis on self-directed, research-based learning has ensured an exponential increase in the use of our libraries at all levels, across the whole curriculum.</p>
<p>&quot;This, together with the push to improve literacy in our schools is a reason surely to beef up the services to our school libraries, not cut them back.”</p>
<p>“This penny pinching decision does not make sense for schools, for library staff, for students and for their parents,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>“These workers were front line, helping with getting key resources into the hands of children.</p>
<p>“National’s contempt for its election promise to cap and not cut the public service apparently knows no bounds.</p>
