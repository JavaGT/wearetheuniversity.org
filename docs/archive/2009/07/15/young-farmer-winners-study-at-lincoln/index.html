<p><strong>Young Farmer Winners Study At Lincoln</strong></p>
<p>Lincoln University has again been confirmed as the place the country’s best young farmers choose to study.</p>
<p>Four of the seven finalists in the weekend’s National Bank Young Farmer of the Year contest were Lincoln graduates and three of them placed first, second and third.</p>
<p>Winner Tim O’Sullivan of Pleasant Point, South Canterbury, graduated with a Bachelor of Agriculture in 2003. The 29-year old has been involved with the Young Farmer contest over the past couple of years, but this year is taking more than $90,000 worth of prizes home with him.</p>
<p>Tim says both farming and Lincoln University are in his blood. “Dad was a Lincoln student in the early 1970s and has two diplomas to show for it, and I’m one of four sons to complete diplomas or degrees there.”</p>
<p>The family farm is a 1000-cow dairy operation near Fairlie, but Tim is based on a cropping and run-off block at Pleasant Point. He is also an irrigation design consultant and co-owner of a company specialising in irrigation and effluent pond liners – and finds time for rugby and fishing. Tim could, because of his age, return to the contest next year to defend his title.</p>
<p>Runner-up Richard Copland, graduated with a Bachelor of Agricultural Science with First Class Honours in 2001. He works as a finance manager for Rabobank, based in Gore, where he also farms a sheep and deer property in partnership with his parents.</p>
<p>Chris Will, a Bachelor of Agriculture graduate (2004) and third-placegetter, is a 50-50 sharemilker with his parents at near Palmerston North.</p>

<p>Lincoln University graduates have now won 20 of 41 Young Farmer contests. In the past ten years, that has included five winners, four second and three thirds. This year is the first time the university has achieved first, second and third and more than ten years – and also sees the Young Farmer of the Year returning to the South Island after two North Island wins.</p>
<p>The Young Farmer of the Year contest is held over three days of physical and intellectual challenges, culminating in a televised show.</p>
