<p>Thin green line stretched to breaking    
       </p>
<p>New Zealand’s economy and biologically-based primary industries have been placed at higher risk as a result of the latest cuts in staff at Biosecurity NZ, Labour Biosecurity spokesperson Damien O’Connor says.</p>
<p>“A cut of $2 million in the Biosecurity budget has contributed to this loss of 60 skilled jobs at a time when the Meat Industry report indicates a likely major biosecurity incursion within the next 10 years and when John Key’s push for streamlining of travel from Australia could result in huge pressure on our border control systems,” Damien O’Connor says.</p>
<p>“Those losing their jobs are all experienced and skilled people who work hard on a thin green line at the border to protect our primary industries and economy.</p>
<p>“This is a time when we should be increasing our surveillance and systems, not undertaking a short-term cost cutting exercise that puts our environment and ecosystems at greater risk.</p>
<p>“The agriculture and horticulture industries are worth billions of dollars and thousands of jobs to New Zealand and ensuring they are protected should be a priority.</p>
<p>“If any damage were to occur to our primary production industries through an introduced pest or disease that would compound the affects of the recession and make it even more difficult for New Zealand’s economy to recover,” Damien O’Connor said.</p>
