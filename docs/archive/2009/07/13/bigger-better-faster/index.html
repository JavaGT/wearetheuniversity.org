<p>Waikato University has unveiled two new microscopes to the world.</p>
<p>A $1 million Hitachi Scanning Electron Microscope replaces its 20-year-old predecessor and comes with a cryogenic preparation unit, allowing it to examine hydrated samples of materials such as liquids or plant matter. It is capable of viewing material down to less than a 1000th of a millimetre.</p>
<p>The other is a $500,000 Transmission Electron Microscope which can image ultra-thin samples of materials such as titanium, or very in-depth samples of biological matter.</p>
<p>Although they’ve been in use for nearly 18 months, the two microscopes were officially opened this month at the University of Waikato. Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford said at the opening that it was critically important to have top-class equipment to do top-class work.</p>
<p>Says facility manager Helen Turner: “This new equipment expands the capability of the Electron Microscope Facility.” A vast amount of research around Waikato University relies on a microscopy facility such as this where everything from plants to shells to composite materials and titanium are imaged and analysed.</p>
<p>“These new systems are better and faster and will considerably cut down analysis time while allowing for larger data sets” Ms Turner says.</p>
