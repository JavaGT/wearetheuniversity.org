<p>Bennett privacy fiasco a sideshow to the real problem – reinstate the T.I.A.</p>
<p>Student leaders today are renewing their call for the reinstatement of the Training Incentive Allowance and are pressing the Minister for Social Development, Hon Paula Bennett, to immediately take action in the face of widespread public concern over the scrapping of this important student support scheme.</p>
<p>“Privacy fiasco aside – the core issue for students is the unjustified scrapping of such a constructive and helpful allowance that for many years has helped people into higher education, and then into the job market, who might not have otherwise had an opportunity to do so” said Jordan King, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.</p>
<p>“In a time of great economic uncertainty and with unemployment on the rise, the TIA was even more valid and necessary and represented a clear commitment from Government to make it easier for those struggling to up skill themselves,” said King. “It makes very little sense at this time to scrap such an important allowance and students are struggling to see how this decision fits in with the National Government’s plan to keep Kiwis in productive work and education,” said King.</p>
<p>“As a country, we all benefit from a highly educated population and we are all responsible for the education of our people. Now more than ever is the time to support those who find accessing education quite difficult and ensure that barriers to education are broken down.” concluded King.</p>

<p>NZUSA urges the Minister to abandon the cuts and reinstate the Training Incentive Allowance immediately or else face being held responsible for preventing the participation of those who need to be accessing education at such a crucial time.</p>
<p>For reference, Jordan King’s student loan currently sits at $24,594.10 and his Co-President, Sophia Blair’s balance is currently at $21, 711.93. King and Blair feel it is appropriate to pre-emptively release these figures given their criticism of the Minister, and before the Minister does it for them.</p>
