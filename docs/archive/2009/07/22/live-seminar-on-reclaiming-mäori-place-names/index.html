<p>Dr Katene says the seminars will be of interest to Mäori university staff, students, practitioners and professionals.</p>
<p>“The academy was established in response to the need for a well-qualified Mäori academic and professional workforce of high calibre Mäori leaders,&quot; he says. &quot;The project has three main aims – advancing Mäori scholarship excellence, strengthening links between Mäori professionals and Mäori academics and accelerating Mäori leadership. These aims will be met through a series of academy-sponsored activities that also include lectures, leaders’ groups, forums and symposia.</p>
<p>“The aim of the live lectures is to expose a wide range of methodologies, areas of scholarship and research findings.&quot;<br>ends  </p>
