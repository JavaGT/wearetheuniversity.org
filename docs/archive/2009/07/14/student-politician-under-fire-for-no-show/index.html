<p>Student Politician Under Fire For No-Show</p>
<p>Ryan Bridge | Tuesday 14 July</p>
<p>A student politician has failed to front-up to allegations he’s responsible for losing a student-owned laptop and wasting time and money on a failed database project.</p>
<p>Victoria University Students’ Association (VUWSA) Education Officer, Robert Latimer, declined several invitations by a student radio show to face-off with VUWSA President Jasmine Freemantle in a live debate.</p>
<p>After several attempts by The VBC Breakfast show to persuade Latimer to join the debate, which was set to take place this Wednesday morning, Latimer sighted time restrictions as a reason for his no-show.</p>
<p>“I am well aware of the importance of this issue. I have to attend my classes in the first week. None of those times I am free. What questions do you want to ask?” Latimer said.</p>
<p>However, VUWSA President Jasmine Freemantle doesn’t buy the excuse, because Latimer was offered a range of different time slots to attend the debate.</p>
<p>“I’m disappointed he’s not willing to be accountable to students… it’s yet another example of [Latimer] undermining the democratic process,” Freemantle said.</p>
<p>VBC Managing Co-Director Matthew Davis today confirmed that Freemantle will still be interviewed on the show, ahead of a vote to ‘roll’ both Latimer and herself, from 9:30 am on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tune in to the VBC breakfast show at 88.3 FM in central Wellington, or stream it live at <a href="http://www.vbc.org.nz">www.vbc.org.nz</a>.</p>
