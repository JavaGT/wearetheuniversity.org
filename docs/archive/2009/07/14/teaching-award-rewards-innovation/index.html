<p>A Massey University senior finance lecturer is the first person from a New Zealand university to win the Australasian Pearson Accounting/Finance Lecturer of the Year Award.</p>
<p>Dr Hamish Anderson, who lectures at the Manawatu campus, travelled to Adelaide to collect his award last week at the Accounting and Finance Association of Australia and New Zealand Conference Dinner.</p>
<p>The aim of the award is to encourage and recognise innovative teaching practices in accounting or finance. The Lecturer of the Year Award selection criteria include interest and enthusiasm for teaching and promoting student learning, the ability to organise course material and to present it cogently and imaginatively, and command of subject matter, including the incorporation in teaching of recent developments in the field of study.</p>
<p>Dr Anderson says as well as passion, his success with teaching comes from continually seeking to make his topic relevant and accessible to the diverse range of students. “It is just amazing to watch when the light bulb goes on and you see a student grasp a concept for the first time,” he says.</p>
<p>Increasing student access in financial learning is aided through Dr Anderson being an early adopter of new communication mediums and technology to create a learning environment that his students can relate to.</p>
<p>“Feedback I get from students is that this gives them a more enriched learning experience and is more engaging for them,” he says. “I was delighted to get a personal thank-you note last week from a student who took an extramural paper last semester and found the use of a range of mediums very helpful.”</p>

<p>Another bonus is being in Massey University’s research-led environment, which means the work he does in that area translates to real life learning for himself and his students.</p>
<p>“My personal research goal is to conduct quality academic research that has relevance to the industry and enriches by teaching,” Dr Anderson says. “A theme that runs through my research is the impact of regulation or market structures on shareholder wealth and its impact on investor and management behaviour.”</p>
<p>Dr Anderson was last year a recipient of the Massey University Vice-Chancellors Teaching Award and a national Tertiary Teaching Excellence Award for sustained excellence in teaching.</p>
