<p>26 July 2009 Media Statement<br>Secret polytechnic plan a backwards step</p>
<p>The Government’s secret plan to take the scalpel to polytechnic governing councils is a short-sighted and backwards step, says Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Maryan Street.</p>
<p>The plan was revealed today after a confidential memo written by the Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics New Zealand (ITPNZ) was leaked to the media. It appears to follow meetings with Tertiary Minister Anne Tolley.</p>
<p>“The memo spells out the Government’s plans to reduce polytechnic councils to eight members, down from up to 20,” says Maryan Street.</p>
<p>“Maori and Pasifika representatives would be axed, as would union and employer representatives. This is a classic ‘cutting off your nose despite your face’ type of<br>action.</p>
<p>“We need representatives of all these groups on the councils to ensure polytechnics are connected to the communities they need to focus on servicing.</p>
<p>“The proportion of our youth who are Maori and Pasifika is growing by the day and the demographics show this trend will continue. These students have not always been well-served by our education system and continued improvement makes it imperative that representatives linked to these communities are on the councils,” says Maryan Street.</p>
<p>“Employer and union representation is equally critical on the councils because these groups know what skills and training are required to ensure New Zealand emerges from the recession able to hit the ground running.</p>

<p>“Of major concern is the obvious plan to ensure the Government has much greater control over what the polytechnics are doing. There are now three or four ministerial appointments on the councils, which are normally between 14-20 members strong.</p>
<p>“Mrs Tolley wants that changed so that the Government appoints half the council, including the chairperson. This is a major shift, taking power away from the community and giving the Government much greater ability to interfere.</p>
<p>“The ITPNZ says in its memo that it is not confident Mrs Tolley has a ‘clear vision’ of what she wants to achieve, which appears something of an understatement. This is more short-sighted costs cutting which will cost the country in the end.”</p>
