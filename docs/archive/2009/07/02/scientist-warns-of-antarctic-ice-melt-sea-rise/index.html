<p>Media Release<br>2 July 2009</p>
<p>Scientist warns of rising sea levels due to Antarctic ice melt</p>
<p>Tim Naish says new evidence shows that changes to Antarctica’s most vulnerable element, the West Antarctic ice sheet, could raise global sea levels by up to five metres.</p>
<p>The Director of Victoria University’s Antarctic Research Centre will present this new evidence at his inaugural professorial lecture on Tuesday 7 July at Victoria University.</p>
<p>“Polar ice sheets have grown and collapsed at least 40 times over the past five million years, causing major sea-level fluctuations. The most recent ‘interglacial’ has lasted 10,000 years, during which time global sea-level and atmospheric temperatures have remained more or less constant, and human civilisation has flourished.”</p>
<p>Professor Naish says much of his research has focused on the international ANDRILL drilling programme in the sedimentary layers of the West Antarctic ice sheet.</p>
<p>“Evidence shows that this sheet is expected to melt first, along with Greenland. West Antarctica sits below sea level, so as the ocean warms, the ice sheet also warms. One way to understand this is to use the paeloclimate record to go back to a time when the earth was warmer and to see how West Antarctica behaved. We know that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were slightly above what they are now, and the earth was two to three degrees warmer. When the West Antarctica ice sheet collapsed numerous times, it raised sea levels by up to 10 metres.”</p>

<p>Professor Naish says his lecture will focus on this major finding, and its relevance to future climate change.</p>
<p>“In the past, these climate changes were happening naturally but now we’ve accelerated this process, the greenhouse gases are rising and temperatures are rising faster than they ever have in the past. It’s one of the big issues of our time and it will have a profound effect on our future society.”</p>
<p>The findings are an opportunity to take a major step forward in our understanding of the Antarctic ice sheet’s response to global climate change.</p>
<p>Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says Professor Naish is an outstanding researcher, teacher and leader in the field of Antarctic research.</p>
<p>“Professor Naish’s Antarctic research has raised international awareness about the role of Antarctic ice sheets in climate and sea-level change. Through the ANDRILL project in particular, he has provided leadership on an issue that is of global significance.”</p>
<p>Professor Walsh says Victoria’s Inaugural Lecture series is an opportunity for new professors to provide family, friends, colleagues and the wider community with an insight to their specialist area of study.</p>
<p>“It is also an opportunity for the University to celebrate and acknowledge our valued professors.”</p>
<p>Professor Naish became Associate Professor and Deputy Director of Victoria’s Antarctic Research Centre in 2005 and was promoted to Director of the Centre in 2007.</p>
<p>For the past five years he has led four major paleoclimate research initiatives including the international ANDRILL drilling programme.</p>
<p>The public lecture is at 6pm in the Hunter Building, Lecture Theatre 323, Gate 1 or 2 Kelburn Parade on Tuesday 7 July. To RSVP, email <a href="mailto:rsvp@vuw.ac.nz">rsvp@vuw.ac.nz</a> with ‘Naish’ in the subject line.</p>
