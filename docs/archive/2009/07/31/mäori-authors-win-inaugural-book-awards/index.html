<p><strong>Mäori authors win inaugural book awards</strong></p>
<p>Books about Mäori written by Mäori were the resounding choice of hundreds of voters in Massey’s Inaugural Ngä Kupu Ora Book Awards.</p>
<p>Kaihautü Mäori (Mäori library services manager) Spencer Lilley says the idea for organising book awards recognising Mäori literature was as a result of other major book awards consistently failing to include Mäori items in their awards.</p>
<p>“The overarching trend across the six categories was that books about Mäori written by Mäori were the most popular. This is a reflection of how far publishing has come in this country in the last 20-30 years, back then you will have been very hard pressed to find a book about Mäori written by a Mäori author,” Mr Lilley says.</p>
<p>Despite missing out on an award at the Montana Book Awards announced earlier in the week, Ngä Tama Toa: The Price of Citizenship by Massey graduate Dr Monty Soutar was a clear favourite in the history category.</p>
<p>The result of the te reo Mäori category also differed to the Montana awards with Tähuhu körero : The sayings of Tai Tokerau written by Dr Merata Kawharu narrowly winning ahead of He Pätaka Kupu te kai a te rangatira compiled by Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Mäori (the Mäori Language Commission).</p>
<p>Massey’s Te Reo Professor Taiarahia Black praised He Pataka Kupu as it represents “an important tool in the continuum of te reo Mäori immersion and regeneration and sets the benchmark for iwi to develop their own Mäori language dictionaries”.</p>
<p>Massey researcher and honours student, Malcolm Mulholland’s Beneath the Mäori Moon was the popular winner of the sports and recreation category. “The importance and popularity of Mäori rugby to New Zealand’s national game has been captured by Mulholland and his win in this section reinforces the positive reception the book has received from reviewers and commentators,” says Mr Lilley.</p>
