<p>&quot;Should I Resign?&quot;- Latimer</p>
<p>Ryan Bridge | Independent Journalist | 17 July 2009</p>
<p>An embattled student politician has reportedly asked fellow executive members if he should resign from his position at the Victoria University of Wellington Students&#39; Association (VUWSA).</p>
<p>It&#39;s been a trying week for VUWSA&#39;s Education Officer, Robert Latimer, who made headlines after failing to front-up to allegations he lost confidential documents relating to Victoria students.</p>
<p>Latimer has reportedly asked members of VUWSA&#39;s executive, including president Jasmine Freemantle, if they believe he is fit for the job.</p>
<p>The question came less than 24 hours after Latimer faced the public in a bid to have him removed from his position. The bid failed after the public meeting didn&#39;t reach quorum.</p>
<p>VUWSA President Jasmine Freemantle today confirmed that she&#39;d been approached by Latimer.</p>
<p>&quot;Robert asked me if I thought it&#39;d be a good idea for him to resign. I told him that he should reflect on what he&#39;s achieved and decide if he thinks he still has the support of the student body,&quot; Freemantle said.</p>
<p>When interviewed on Wednesday afternoon, Latimer confirmed he would be considering his future at VUWSA regardless of the outcome of the vote [to have him rolled].</p>
<p>&quot;I will be thinking about my role as Education Officer and will make a decision about whether to stay on&quot;</p>
<p>Several other VUWSA executive members have confirmed they&#39;ve also been approached. Latimer reportedly plans to seek the opinions of all executive members by the end of the week.</p>
