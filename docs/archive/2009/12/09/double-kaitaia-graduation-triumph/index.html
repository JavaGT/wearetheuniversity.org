<p>Double Kaitaia graduation triumph</p>
<p>When best friends Bridget Dawson and Ashlee Peeters left Kaitaia for university three years ago their hearts remained behind. Now, after both graduating with a bachelor of business degree from AUT University yesterday, the pair says the world’s their oyster.</p>
<p>Dawson, a 20-year-old from Ngati Kahu, Te Rawara and Te Aupouri majored in management and marketing. The A student graduated at the top in her degree and was invited to represent all graduating students to speak at the AUT Faculty of Business and Law ceremony. The university invited Kaitaia College principal William Tailby and head boy Jackson Davis and head girl Tyla Stevenson to attend the ceremony.</p>
<p>Dawson said while she was nervous, the privilege of being asked overrode any stage fright she may have had.</p>
<p>“It was a huge honour to stand up in front of my graduating class, their friends and families, and talk on their behalf; it is something I will remember for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p>Dawson says moving from Kaitaia to Auckland was an eye-opener but it has armed her with a truck load of confidence.</p>
<p>“Auckland was a culture shock but I enjoyed the diversity, challenges and opportunities that it presented, especially in my studies,” she says.</p>
<p>“Kaitaia is a wonderful town to grow up in with its tight-knit community and I am hugely proud of it. They bred us with a strong mind and a strong will which gave me the determination to follow through with my aspirations. And I’m glad I got the chance to show Auckland what a small-town girl is capable of achieving.”</p>

<p>Peeters who went to Kaitaia College with Dawson agrees that growing up in the supportive Kaitaia community meant she was ready to take on the big city.</p>
<p>“I&#39;m really am proud to say I come from the far north,” says Peeters. “The Kaitaia community is a happy one. Seeing the realities of life there has helped me to believe in myself and pushed me to follow my dreams. I know that no matter where a person comes from if they put their mind to it they can do what they want.</p>
<p>“And it was always great being able to escape the concrete jungle and head back to the serenity of the Northland country and beaches.”</p>
<p>Peeters, a  21-year-old from Nga Puhi, majored in finance and economics. She says living in AUT’s student apartments made moving to Auckland easy.</p>
<p>“It was great socially but also meant I had my friends around to support me. And Bridget and I were able to study together and help each other with assignments.”</p>
<p>Both girls chose the AUT Business School because of its small classrooms with student laptops and interactive teaching.</p>
<p>“We had amazing lecturers with vast industry knowledge,” says Dawson. “Learning from their experience created lively class discussions, and the engaging learning environment embraced a whole diversity of people, cultures and ideas”</p>
<p>Peeters agrees, adding support systems like the AUT Maori liaison team helped her excel beyond her expectations.</p>
<p>“At AUT students aren&#39;t left to fend for themselves,” says Peeters. “The staff and academics are focused on helping us to pass to the best of our abilities.”</p>
<p>Peeters, also an A student, adds that the best part of studying was getting her marks back.</p>
<p>“This made all the hard work worth while,” she laughs. “Handing in the last assignment for my degree was also a great feeling; knowing I had finished.”</p>
<p>Dawson and Peeters are confident their studies have given them a strong understanding of current global challenges and trends in business.</p>
<p>“We had to keep up-to-date by reading newspapers and watching the news,” says Dawson. “Class discussions centred around real case studies and current world issues. In one of my classes we spent the first 20-30 minutes discussing what has been happening in the world by using our business understanding.”</p>
<p>The pair adds that the nine-week work experience, compulsory in the business degree, gave them a first-hand look at how organisations operate.</p>
<p>“We learned it was up to us to give it our best shot with the tools we’d gathered in our degree,” says Dawson. “And like a lot of the students, I was lucky enough to be offered a full-time position after my work experience.”</p>
<p>Both Dawson and Peeters were recipients of the AUT Faculty of Business and Law Maori Scholarships, which granted them full paid fees for three years. The pair agrees that being Maori gives them the pride and passion to make New Zealand proud.</p>
<p>“I plan to create something special that reflects my background and values,&quot; Dawson says. “I want to make my mark on the world so that when I am old I can say I made a difference.”</p>
<p>Peeters nods, adding: “Being Maori has given me a strong appreciation of different cultures. I understand the importance of having support people and whanau around to help me and being there to support others when they need help.”</p>
<p>Faculty of Business and Law Dean, Professor Des Graydon praised the outstanding duo adding that AUT Maori Scholarship recipients typically excel in their academic studies.</p>
<p>Peeters is now weighing up her future, choosing between starting her career or going back to university to do an honours degree.</p>
<p>“Next year is full of options, and I definitely plan to travel in the future. But one thing’s for certain, one day I will give back to AUT and the far north community for the experiences they have given me.”</p>
<p>Dawson, who is doing her honours year next year is already considering her O.E.</p>
<p>“You only live once,” she says with a grin. “Everyone experiences fear and often it stops them from achieving their dreams. I’m inspired to take on the challenge and live my life where fear is something I know is inside of me, but won’t stop me from unleashing my potential.”</p>
<p>She adds that her dream is to be a small business owner and retiring by the beach. Kaitaia, perhaps?</p>
<p>“Maybe,” she laughs. “But no matter where in the world I am, Kaitaia will always be home.&quot;</p>
