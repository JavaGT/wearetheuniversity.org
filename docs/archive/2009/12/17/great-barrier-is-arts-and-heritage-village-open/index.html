<p>Nikki Kaye<br>MP for Auckland Central</p>

<p>Great Barrier Island Arts and Heritage Village open for business</p>
<p>Yesterday&#39;s opening of the Great Barrier Island Arts and Heritage Village represents a great example of the community working together to make this project a reality.</p>
<p>I am delighted to see yet another example of the cultural richness of the Hauraki Gulf becoming available to both the wider community and visitors to Great Barrier.</p>
<p>In particular the Great Barrier Community Board and Auckland City Council should be acknowledged for delivering this project.</p>
<p>Over the last 5 weeks, many islanders have volunteered and worked hard at lightning speed to get it up and running.</p>
<p>Representatives at the opening included Councillor’s Toni Millar and Denise Roche, the community board, Ngati Rehua and over 100 people from the island.</p>
<p>The village will provide a hub for over 90 artists on the island to boost their income and deliver a much needed community facility.</p>
<p>Over the summer months, thousands of Aucklanders travel to Great Barrier and will be able to enjoy the beautiful artwork produced by local islanders.</p>
<p>I look forward to working closely with the community to continue to enhance the new village.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
