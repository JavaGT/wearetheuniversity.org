<p>Embargoed to 4.30pm 3 December 2009<br>Media Statement</p>
<p>John Key is wasting half a million dollars to keep his mate in a job</p>
<p>Labour Leader Phil Goff today called on Prime Minister John Key to save New Zealand hundreds of thousands of dollars by disbanding the Don Brash-led 2025 Taskforce Mr Key set up with Act.</p>
<p>“The Taskforce’s first report, this week, was a complete and utter waste of money, Phil Goff said in a speech in Napier.</p>
<p>“The report was widely and deservedly panned by nearly everyone who read it. It cost $150,000, according to media reports, and contained nothing that we have not repeatedly heard over many years from Dr Brash.</p>
<p>“Mr Key and Finance Minister Bill English have both described the report’s recommendations as too radical. In fact, Mr Key completely dismissed the report on Sunday before he had even read it.</p>
<p>“Labour supports any moves that will increase New Zealand’s overall wealth as long as they are credible and do not result in a massive distribution of wealth from ordinary New Zealanders to the privileged elite.</p>
<p>“While it might suit John Key’s purposes for the Taskforce to continue making economically Right Wing recommendations that give him room to make radical but not as radical changes that favour the well off, that is no good reason for continuing this expensive charade.</p>
<p>“The Taskforce has a budget of $477,000 over three years. So I have a challenge for the Government – don’t be relaxed or comfortable with this waste – dump this soapbox for Act and Dr Brash, and save the taxpayer the unspent $330,000,” Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>“Just say no thanks. In these tough times, when the Government is calling for everyone else to show restraint, keep the money and spend it on something worthwhile.”</p>
