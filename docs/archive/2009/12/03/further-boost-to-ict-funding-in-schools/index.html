<p>Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga<br>MP for Maungakiekie</p>
<p>03 December 2009<br>Media Statement</p>
<p>Further boost to ICT funding in schools</p>
<p>Local schools Royal Oak School and Royal Oak Intermediate School are set to benefit from a new round of ICT upgrades, Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
<p>Education Minister Anne Tolley and Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce have confirmed that 100 more schools will benefit from a $21.5 million allocation for school network upgrades.</p>
<p>The new roll out is the latest round of the $150 million boost for school network upgrades, which is part of the government’s $1.5 billion Broadband Investment Initiative.</p>
<p>“We want to ensure our schools can provide the best possible education for our students and this roll out will make a significant contribution to that,” Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
<p>“Here in Maungakiekie, ultra-fast broadband can make a real difference to our economic and social wellbeing. Students need to be able to take full advantage of the benefits of technology.”</p>
<p>Upgrading the schools’ networks will mean teachers and students in every classroom will have the capability to access ultra-fast broadband.</p>
<p>“Access to high-speed broadband is a vital part of ensuring students get a 21st century education in a 21st century economy,” Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
<p>“We expect that up to 2000 schools will be upgraded over the next six years. We’re aiming to have ultra-fast broadband access to 97 per cent of schools, serving 99.7 per cent of all students, in that time.”</p>
<p>More schools will be invited to upgrade their networks in early 2010.</p>
