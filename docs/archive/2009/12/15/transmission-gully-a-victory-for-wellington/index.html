<p>Transmission Gully A Victory For Wellington</p>
<p>Hon Heather Roy, ACT Deputy Leader<br>Tuesday, December 15 2009</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Deputy Leader and Wellington-based MP Heather Roy today congratulated Transport Minister Steven Joyce for doing what his predecessors would not: listening to the public and taking action on the long-awaited and controversial Transmission Gully.</p>
<p>&quot;For years, I called for Transmission Gully to be built - those calls fell on the deaf ears of a Labour-led Government that was not focussed on the infrastructure needs of the country&#39;s capital,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;It did not matter to the previous Government that, with only one fragile coast road in and out of the city, Wellington would be completely cut off from outside life-saving assistance in the event of a major emergency - a very real possibility given our location on a major faultline.</p>
<p>&quot;All we&#39;ve had is empty talk about Wellington&#39;s infrastructure deficit but this is now being addressed through the strategic upgrade of SH1 from Wellington Airport to Levin - which will see the construction of Transmission Gully, improvements around the Basin Reserve, Mt Victoria Tunnel duplication, and Terrace Tunnel duplication.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s announcement is great news for Wellingtonians. We have fought long and hard for Wellington Airport-Levin route to be upgraded - including Transmission Gully - and the Government has heeded our call,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
