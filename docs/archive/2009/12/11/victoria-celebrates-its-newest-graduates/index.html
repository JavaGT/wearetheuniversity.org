<p>“Victoria is the start of many exciting and rewarding careers both nationally and internationally, and I look forward to following our new graduates’ successes.”</p>

<p><strong>Interesting graduation stories include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mina Moayed</strong><br>Iran-born Mina is of the Baha’i faith. She escaped from Iran as a teenager 25 years ago, because she was banned from studying at university in Iran due to her religious beliefs. Mina will be graduating with an MBA, on Wednesday 16 December at 6pm.</p>
<p><strong>Wellington Lions graduating – Victor Vito and Arden David-Perrot</strong><br>Two Pacific Island members of the Wellington Lions rugby team will be graduating in Wednesday’s 1.30pm ceremony, following the graduation parade. Arden David-Perrot will graduate with a BA in Education and Pacific Studies, and Victor Vito will graduate with a BA in Classics.</p>
<p><strong>Mother and daughter – Philippa and Rachel Burns</strong><br>Philippa and Rachel will be graduating with Bachelor of Arts degrees at the same ceremony on 16 December at 1.30pm. Philippa (mother) will be wearing the family graduation gown, first worn 100 years ago in 1909 at Canterbury College by her paternal grandmother Henrietta Dyer. The gown has been worn by four generations of the family so far.</p>
<p><strong>Visha Balakrishnan</strong><br>Visha is from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. She completed her PhD in Education in two and a half years, while adjusting and adapting to life in New Zealand and caring for her two boys aged eight and 12. Her research focuses on using real-life dilemmas to teach moral education in secondary schools. She was one of the Olympic torch bearers in 2008, and says that when she was running with the torch, it gave her the feeling that she would make it in her PhD journey too and “all she had to do is work hard and stay focused”.</p>
<p>During her stay in New Zealand, Visha has done some tutoring in the university and has volunteered to work with refugees and migrants on English Language skills who are settling in New Zealand, to help them cope with the language and the many daily life challenges that they face.</p>
