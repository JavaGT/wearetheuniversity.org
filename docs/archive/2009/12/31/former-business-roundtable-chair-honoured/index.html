<p><strong>Thursday, 31 December 2009, 9:13 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Business_Roundtable">New Zealand Business Roundtable</a></strong></p>
<p>Former Business Roundtable Chair Honoured</p>
<p>New Zealand Business Roundtable chairman Rob McLeod today congratulated former Business Roundtable chairman Sir Douglas Myers on being made Knight Companion of the Order of New Zealand for services to business and the community.</p>
<p>Mr McLeod said that Sir Douglas, who was chairman of the Business Roundtable from 1990 to 1997 and former chief executive and chairman of Lion Nathan, was an outstanding leader who had made an extraordinary contribution to business, public affairs and the community.</p>
<p>“Douglas is one of those rare business leaders with a clear understanding of both public policy and business management and what differentiates the two. Like his predecessor, founding Roundtable chairman Sir Ronald Trotter, Douglas has been willing to speak out on national issues and put the country’s interests ahead of personal popularity. He succeeded at the top level in business, and maintains a strong interest in New Zealand public life.</p>
<p>“In a quiet and understated way, Douglas has also been an enormously generous contributor to New Zealand’s sporting, cultural and academic communities. The Business Roundtable is delighted to see his exceptional contribution to New Zealand life recognised in this way”, said Mr McLeod.</p>
