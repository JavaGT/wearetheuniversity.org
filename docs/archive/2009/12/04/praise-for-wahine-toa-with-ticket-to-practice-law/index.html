<p>MEDIA STATEMENT<br>Te Ururoa Flavell<br>Maori Party MP for Waiariki</p>
<p>4 December 2009</p>
<p>Flavell commends wahine toa for ticket to practice law</p>
<p>Maori Party MP for Waiariki Te Ururoa Flavell is praising a young Te Arawa mother and Maori martial arts student who will be admitted to the bar today.</p>
<p>Karla Kereopa&#39;s admission in the Rotorua Court House, which will allow her to practice law, will be a proud moment not only for her but the iwi of Ngati Whakaue, Ngati Wahiao and Rakaipaka whom she hails from, Mr Flavell said.</p>
<p>&quot;Karla is an amazing wahine - a beacon of hope for young Maori mothers,” Mr Flavell said.</p>
<p>&quot;Karla’s whanau and the people of Te Arawa and Ngati Kahungunu can be very proud of one of their daughters today.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not praise enough the great achievements of our people and its time we stop focusing on the doom and gloom so people like Karla get the recognition they deserve. And so their stories can inspire others.&quot;</p>
<p>A graduate of the law school at Waikato University, the 30-something-year-old has worked as a law clerk at Waihere Hope now known as Te Nahu-Lovell &amp; Co which has offices in Rotorua and Wellington.</p>
<p>Despite what is expected to be a busy legal career a head, Karla is very much committed to her Maoritanga and will continue to study part time at the Matarua Federation of Traditional Maori Martial Arts where she is a tau or level three student, Mr Flavell said.</p>
