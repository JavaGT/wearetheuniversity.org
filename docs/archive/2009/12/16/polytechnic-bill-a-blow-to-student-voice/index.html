<p>Passing of Polytechnic Bill a blow to the student voice and quality education  
 </p>
<p>Student leaders today are appalled at the passing of the Education (Polytechnics) Amendment Bill as it signals drastic changes for Polytechnics and removes the voice of students in governance level decision making, and are questioning the rushed and poor process with which this Bill has been pushed through.</p>
<p>“The long history of positive contribution of student representatives to governance of Polytechnics has been completely trampled over today and as result, the voice of students at their local Polytechnic are at risk of being completely ignored,” said Sophia Blair, Co-President of New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.</p>
<p>“The process for these changes has been a complete joke. Due to the rush to pass this legislation, significant changes made after the select committee submission process which removed the safeguards of student and staff representatives have meant there has been no time for further consultation or input from sectors which will be directly affected. This whole process has been a complete farce,” said Blair.</p>
<p>“Students in New Zealand pay high fees to gain an education, and as a result, should have a say about the quality of education that they receive, “ said Blair. “The quality of that education will have a direct effect on their future career prospects. Accordingly, as tertiary education is a prerequisite for many careers and is of direct importance to the well-being of graduates, students should, and deserve to, have a voice and a say in decisions that will directly impact on their future,” added Blair</p>

<p>“From an organisational management point of view, involving those who will be affected by decisions ensures that these decisions will be easier to implement as they are likely to have broad agreement from the outset. Such processes reflect good faith and an inclusive approach, demonstrating the Polytechnic’s recognition and appreciation of the role students hold in the tertiary community,” said Blair.</p>
<p>“It was extremely disappointing to see that Minister Tolley did not even turn up to the second reading of this Bill and showed a distinct lack of interest at the third reading today. Given that this Bill will have a significant impact on students, the largest group in the tertiary sector, they will be right to question the Government’s commitment to ensuring that students get a high quality, relevant and appropriate education,” said Blair.</p>
<p>“NZUSA questions why the National-led Government would push through a Bill that removes the key mechanism for ensuring the education that New Zealanders receive is both relevant and of high quality. This move is completely at odds with their stated goals for tertiary education in New Zealand,” concluded Blair.</p>
