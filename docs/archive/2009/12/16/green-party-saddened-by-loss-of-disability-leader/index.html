<p>Green Party saddened by loss of disability leader</p>
<p>It is with great sadness that the Green Party acknowledges the death of leading disability activist and tertiary educator Todd Fernie.</p>
<p>Green Party Disability Spokesperson Catherine Delahunty expresses a personal sense of loss and said Todd had deeply impressed her with his humanity, perception, and leadership.</p>
<p>Todd Fernie was the Scholarship Recruitment and Training Adviser for disabled students at AUT University. He managed the School and Community Partnership scholarships for disabled and deaf students. Todd oversaw the allocation of scholarship and monitored the process ensuring that all applicants completed the &#39;Scholarship Recruitment Critical Pathway&#39;.</p>
<p>Todd also supported the career development of students and provided pastoral support and mentoring for all disabled students on scholarship at AUT University. He was in charge of training packages and leadership studies as well as assisting faculties and allied staff groups to develop disability responsiveness.</p>
<p>He was a leader in terms of human service, leadership, disability politics, facilitation, philosophy, advocacy, business, and brokering collaborative partnerships.</p>
<p>Todd was also the author of a paper titled The Mechanics of Perception: A Disabling World View.</p>
<p>Todd Fernie and Marcus Henning provided the vision for a new book, Towards Inclusive Learning in Higher Education which is a widely used text book in inclusive education.</p>
<p>Todd was also an “Attitude Award” winner in 2008 and was involved in governance of disability organisations.</p>
<p>The Green Party expresses our sympathy and love to his family and his community for the great loss of an inspirational and talented young man.</p>
