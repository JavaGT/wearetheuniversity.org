<p><strong>Wednesday, 16 December 2009, 9:55 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Maryan Street<br><strong>Tertiary Education Spokesperson</strong></p>
<p>15 December 2009 <strong>Media Statement</strong><br><strong>Shoddy and dangerous polytech Bill progresses</strong></p>
<p>Shoddy and dangerous legislation stripping away guaranteed representation for Maori, students, staff, industry and community representatives from polytech councils passed its second reading today, says Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Maryan Street.</p>
<p>“The Education (Polytech) Amendment Bill enables the Government to seize greater control of polytechnic governing councils and in the process removes provisions guaranteeing representation for all these critical groups.</p>
<p>“The Education Minister once again refused to give any rationale for the changes, but that’s not surprising because there is none. Taking away guaranteed community representation makes no sense when now more than ever we need tertiary education organisations which are responsive to regional needs.</p>
<p>“The Minister&#39;s performance on this issue has been woeful from the outset. She must have muzzled all her colleagues because not one of them got up in the House today to defend her legislation during the second reading,” Maryan Street says.</p>
<p>“Had the Government supported the amendments put up by the Maori Party, our objections would have disappeared. Labour voted for the Maori Party amendments, as they did for ours, because we share the concern about the gutting of community and iwi representatives.</p>
<p>“Adding insult to injury, the Minister went against her own undertakings to student groups by amending the legislation through the select committee process to deprive students of a guaranteed voice on the polytech councils.</p>

<p>“Just six months ago she was telling student groups how important their voices and input were. This month she strikes them from their legitimate role on polytech councils.</p>
<p>“At a time when jobs and skills should be a top priority, Anne Tolley has moved to rob polytechnics of the stakeholder input they need to ensure they are doing the best job possible. It’s simply inexplicable,” Maryan Street said.</p>
