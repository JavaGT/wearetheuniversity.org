<p>Tamaki College to open Service Academy in 2010</p>
<p>Local school Tamaki College in Auckland will be one of seven secondary schools opening a new Service Academy next year, Maungakiekie</p>
<p>“This is a great opportunity for even more year 12 and 13 students to take part in a challenging and motivating programme,” Peseta Sam says.</p>
<p>“There are a number of young people who tend to leave school and find it difficult to find a job, or to move on to tertiary education.</p>
<p>“The new Service Academy is aimed at them. The programme will focus on giving them new skills and a chance to succeed,” he says.</p>
<p>“As Patron of the locally-based Maungarei Cadets, I’ve seen firsthand the work that cadet units play in the community.</p>
<p>“Last Saturday, I attended the final parade of the cadets - one cadet had joined the regular force infantry and another was heading off to basic training in February 2010,” Peseta Sam says.</p>
<p>The military-style programmes are part of the National-led Government’s Youth Opportunities package. They will be provided at schools with the help of the New Zealand Defence Force.</p>
<p>Students will take part in courses such as leadership and outdoor education, and work towards reaching NCEA Level 1 Mathematics and English or above.</p>
<p>“This Government wants to help these students return to a mainstream school, go on to tertiary education or find a sustainable job. The aim is that after a year at the Service Academy, they will be able to do just that.</p>
