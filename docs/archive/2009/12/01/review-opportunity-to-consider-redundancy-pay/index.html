<p>Minister’s review opportunity to consider redundancy pay</p>
<p>The Government should review minimum redundancy entitlements as part of its evaluation of provisions under the Employment Relations Act, Labour’s Associate labour spokesperson Darien Fenton said today.</p>
<p>“National’s review of Part 6A of the ACT is a good opportunity to investigate minimum redundancy entitlements,” Darien Fenton said.</p>
<p>“Labour implemented Part 6A because it was a crucial element in improving job security and protection in situations of contracting out, particularly for low paid, vulnerable workers.</p>
<p>“Those provisions must not be tampered with.</p>
<p>“It also provides for workers in specific industries who have been transferred to a new employer to bargain redundancy. In events where redundancy cannot be agreed, the Act allows the Employment Authority to determine minimum entitlements.</p>
<p>“However, Part 6A does not provide protection for those workers whose employment agreements expressly exclude redundancy pay. And there are no redundancy protections at all for other workers.</p>
<p>“The recession has seen thousands of workers laid off with little notice and no redundancy pay. The review of Part 6A is a great opportunity for wider discussion about redundancy entitlements for all workers.”</p>
<p>Ms Fenton says the review should look at whether New Zealand’s redundancy protection should catch up with other OECD countries that provide minimum notice and redundancy compensation.</p>
<p>“Kate Wilkinson has said that if there is a need for improvement she will be happy to look at suitable amendments,” Darien Fenton said.</p>
<p>“Labour will take a keen interest in the review and urges the Minister to consider the provisions of my redundancy protection bill as part of it.”</p>
