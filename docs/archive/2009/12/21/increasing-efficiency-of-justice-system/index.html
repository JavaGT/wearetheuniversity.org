<p><strong>Monday, 21 December 2009, 2:20 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Govt plan for increasing efficiency of justice system</p>
<p>The Government today continued its drive for reform of the justice system by releasing a bill plan seeking input on proposals to shorten court waiting times and trials, increase efficiencies, and introduce technology to criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>The bill plan will form the basis for a Criminal Procedure Bill to be introduced to Parliament next year.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s estimated that the reforms we&#39;re proposing have the potential to save thousands of court events and court sitting hours,&quot; Mr Power said.</p>
<p>&quot;This will lead to cases progressing through the system much more quickly, resulting in a more efficient system that delivers justice to victims, witnesses, defendants, and the community,&quot; Mr Power said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Criminal Procedure Simplification Project is a substantial piece of work, and I&#39;m confident its reforms will be effective. The bill plan shows how the changes would work as an integrated package.&quot;</p>
<p>The release of the bill plan closely follows the recent introduction of the Courts (Remote Participation) Bill to allow the greater use of video-links in court proceedings.</p>
<p>&quot;Our courts have used audio-visual technology for witness evidence for some time</p>
<p>&quot;Allowing that technology to be used for a wider range of criminal proceedings would mean offenders can appear in court by video-link for routine appearances, making courts faster and safer, and saving money and resources.</p>
<p>&quot;This consultation is another milestone in this Government&#39;s commitment to substantial overhaul of the justice system.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ve looked at victims&#39; rights, and how victims can be supported through the court process, and we&#39;re looking hard at legal aid.</p>
<p>&quot;I encourage court users and the public to express their views on the bill plan.&quot;</p>
<p>The bill plan is available <a href="http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy-and-consultation/crime/criminal-procedure-simplification-project">here</a>.</p>
