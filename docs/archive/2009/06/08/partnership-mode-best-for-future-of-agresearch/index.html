<p><strong>Monday, 8 June 2009, 1:20 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Partnership model agreed as best future for AgResearch and Lincoln University</strong></p>
<p>Three months of investigation by Crown Research Institute AgResearch and Lincoln University have identified that a partnership model would be preferable to a full amalgamation as it will be more cost effective and still achieve significant benefits for New Zealand.</p>
<p>The two organisations will remain separate entities but focus on working much more closely together on a range of partnership initiatives.</p>
<p>AgResearch and Lincoln University announced in March a combined consultative approach to investigate how they could work more closely to develop land-based research and education through investigating the option of a merger. The two organisations worked closely and effectively in identifying the opportunities a new entity might deliver and during this process it became clear the significant benefits to New Zealand could be most cost effectively delivered from a partnership rather than an amalgamation.</p>
<p>A number of synergies and benefits of closer collaboration between the two organisations have been identified through the investigation process and it has been agreed to pursue a substantial partnership, the form of which will be agreed in the near future.</p>
<p>AgResearch Chairman Sam Robinson says the joint investigation of the benefits of Lincoln University and AgResearch working together has produced a better understanding of the respective capabilities, strengths and expertise of the two organisations.</p>

<p>“We can see the potential for forming productive partnerships in post-graduate supervision, commercialisation activities, and extension teaching,” he says. “Knowledge transfer, through a sustainable partnership particularly focused on technology adoption by the land-based sector is our best shared path for the future.”</p>
<p>Lincoln University Chancellor Tom Lambie says “We are looking forward to a closer working partnership with AgResearch. I believe this will still deliver significant benefits for the land-based sector.”</p>
