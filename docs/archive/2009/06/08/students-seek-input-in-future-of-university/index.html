<p><strong>“Students urge for increased input in future of university”</strong></p>
<p>The Lincoln University Students’ Association (LUSA) President and Lincoln University Council member Megan Harte welcomes the move towards exploring synergies within AgResearch and Lincoln University without significantly changing the direction or nature of either organisation. ”It was becoming increasingly clear that a merged entity posed significant hurdles, and as Student representatives, we were concerned over aspects that were being raised” says Harte.</p>
<p>LUSA is pleased that the cited benefits that were being explored relating to research and teaching are still able to be followed through. Megan also comments that “Obvious synergies in sharing academic and teaching capacity will positively impact on the quality of degrees that students seek relating to those areas”. LUSA urges Lincoln University to move to strengthen and enhance teaching and learning quality in all areas of the university, as part of its commitment to quality teaching and learning.</p>
<p>Concerns raised by the Students’ Association during the merger process was, consultation and due diligence involving key stakeholders was inadequate; and that students were treated as an ad-hoc stakeholder rather than the primary one. Student representatives were not part of either the steering group of the project, or any of the many work streams commissioned. Student representatives on the university council were bound by confidentiality and were unable to speak with the student body about the details of the business case that was being prepared. Though requested, a clear timeframe and process for information to be released was not yet set out. This was reflected by the many comments from students requesting more information.</p>

<p>“Students are the ones who leave with the qualifications and the associated reputation of any university. No matter what, we, as students, are the ones who matter the most” Says Harte. Students expect, going into the future, for any further discussions relating to the future of Lincoln University to involve clear and direct involvement with students as key stakeholders, not begrudgingly, but because they are valued.</p>
