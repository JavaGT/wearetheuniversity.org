<p>Davis: Tolley makes cuts on a whim, not on evidence</p>
<p>Education Minister Anne Tolley is making important education decisions about the professional development of teachers based on a whim rather than evidence, says Labour Associate Education spokesperson Kelvin Davis.</p>
<p>&quot;I was staggered when she admitted in Parliament last week that she neither sought advice nor referred to research when making her decision in the budget to cut 25 percent from teachers&#39; professional development,” Kelvin Davis said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is best practice for teachers to make evidence-based decisions in the classroom to inform their teaching in order to raise achievement, but obviously the same high standard doesn’t apply to the minister.</p>
<p>&quot;While she continues to disregard evidence and research into what creates the best learning environments for students, and instead makes educational decisions based on a whim, we can look forward glumly to stories of under-achievement.</p>
<p>&quot;Teachers deserve something better and more intelligent out of the minister. So, most importantly, do our students.”</p>
