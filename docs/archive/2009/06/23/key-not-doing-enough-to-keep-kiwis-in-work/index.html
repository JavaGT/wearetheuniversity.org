<p><strong>Tuesday, 23 June 2009, 3:35 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>23 June 2009<br>Media Statement</p>
<p>Key not doing enough to keep Kiwis in work</p>
<p>John Key’s admission that unemployment numbers are worse than forecast is further evidence that his Government is not taking the urgent action needed to protect Kiwi jobs, Labour Leader Phil Goff said today.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister promised back in February that his Jobs Summit would save or create thousands of jobs but the evidence is that he has not delivered,” Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>“The truth is the Jobs Summit was little more than a talkfest and a gimmick.</p>
<p>“Over 1000 Kiwis a week are joining the dole queue. New Zealanders are crying out for more action from the Government to preserve jobs but John Key isn’t listening,” Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>Today the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research forecast that 60,000 Kiwis will lose their jobs over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>“New Zealand needs focus, fresh ideas and solutions to tackle unemployment, but the National Government doesn’t have any. Since the Budget the Government has gone silent on preserving and creating jobs,” Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>“John Key’s released 13 statements since Budget day. Just one, on the Green Party&#39;s insulation fund, was linked to jobs.</p>
<p>“Finance Minister Bill English has been even more reticent. One of his two statements dealt with jobs. Ironically it defends National’s cuts to adult education which will cause hundreds more job losses.</p>
<p>“And last, and definitely least, comes Employment Minister Paula Bennett. None of her three media releases relate to jobs at all.”</p>

<p>Phil Goff says John Key and his Ministers either don’t care or have given up on the number one issue facing New Zealanders at the moment.</p>
<p>“Thousands of New Zealanders a week are losing their jobs and John Key is not doing enough to keep them in work,” Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>“Since his Jobs Summit 16,000 New Zealanders have joined the dole queue, and 4000 since the Budget. To date the Jobs Summit has saved just 345 jobs. More urgent action is needed to keep Kiwis in work.”</p>
