<p>Winning Team Feeds The World With The Granulator</p>
<p>An idea for a device that uses food leftovers to help feed livestock in Mozambique won the national final of the Global Enterprise Challenge this week.</p>
<p>Dubbed “The Granulator” the bench-top food processor takes waste food, mulches and pasturises it, then dehydrates it into a fine grain that can be used to feed chickens and pigs.</p>
<p>The design is the brainchild of a team of seven teenagers who took part in the event at Massey University’s Albany campus.</p>
<p>The challenge was to create a product or service that would reduce food waste in New Zealand and stop people going hungry in one of the world’s poorest countries.</p>
<p>Led by joint managing directors Ashleigh Bennett, of Diocesan School for Girls, Auckland, and Aimee Groom, of Taradale High School, Napier, the team named their company Envirolink.</p>
<p>Other team members were: Bethany Balmer of Tawa College, Wellington; Xinran Chen, St Cuthbert’s College; Edvince Hermanoche, Westlake Boys’ High School; Carissa Heunes, Long Bay College and Christina Mills, of Massey High School (all Auckland).</p>
<p>They came up with an idea to use leftover pizza, ham, chicken and beef sandwiches, fruit and a slice from their lunch and process it into granules.</p>
<p>The product would then be collected by a waste management company, put into 20kg loads and given to World Vision, which could pass it onto farmers for animal feed.</p>
<p>“There is nothing you cannot put in The Granulator,” Ms Groom said. “It reduces waste in New Zealand because less goes to landfill and what was once waste now has a purpose.”</p>

<p>The team selected Mozambique as a suitable country to receive the product because of political stability. They spoke to World Vision and Foodstuffs, which would retail the item at $200, about their idea.</p>
<p>Ms Bennett said their business plan included a marketing campaign outlining the key social goal of caring for the global environment.</p>
<p>Corporate mentor Paul Bolte, from Albany-based firm Bartercard, said he never doubted the team would win.</p>
<p>“The team had two strong co-leaders, which made them very powerful because they were able to delegate and lead in separate areas ¬¬- it is very rare to see young people have the maturity to be able to deal with that,” Mr Bolte said.</p>
<p>Professor John Raine, regional chief executive of the Albany campus, described the energy of the students taking part in this challenge as amazing.</p>
<p>“If you can bring the same application and ideas to your own businesses I am sure the country is in good hands,” Professor Raine told them.</p>
<p>The winning team’s proposal then competed against 20 others in a global online contest. The overall winner was Indonesia, which also came up with a way to turn food waste into animal feed.</p>

<p>The Global Enterprise Challenge was organised by the Young Enterprise Trust and the University was the principal sponsor and host. Eighty year-12 and 13 secondary pupils from across New Zealand took part.</p>
<p>Every participant in the challenge received a scholarship worth $1000 from the University&#39;s College of Business and the winning team’s members received $2000 scholarships.</p>
