<p>Senior citizens next on Government’s hit list</p>
<p>Government plans to investigate denying senior citizens access to student loans and allowances are a retrograde and ageist step, says Labour’s Senior Citizens spokesperson Ross Robertson.</p>
<p>“Education Minister Anne Tolley has confirmed she is looking at cutting the tertiary entitlements for over-65s, yet another plan by the National Government to limit access to education.</p>
<p>“We’ve had Adult and Community Education funding slashed, we’ve had confirmation today that polytechnics will be forced to turn thousands of students away because the Minister will penalise the institutions if they enrol them - and now this.</p>
<p>“Older New Zealanders are increasingly remaining in the workforce well beyond the age of 65 and like other New Zealanders need upskilling and ongoing training to ensure they can do their job,” says Ross Robertson.</p>
<p>“And as the size of the older population continues to increase, there will be even more reliance on keeping senior New Zealanders in the workforce.</p>
<p>“Others who rely on superannuation and may have never had time to utilise a student allowance or draw a loan, but could not afford to study otherwise, may now have the carpet pulled from under them,” says Ross Robertson.</p>
<p>“They’ve paid their taxes like everyone else, but this Government obviously thinks they can be treated like second class citizens. Well, they can’t and Government should not underestimate the power and voice of senior citizens who I believe will be incensed by this proposal.</p>
<p>“Universal access to education is part of the fundamental fabric of our society and this Government is now taking successive steps to dismantle that access. Who’s next?</p>
<p>“Education is a lifelong experience and it should remain that way. Anne Tolley should drop this idiotic idea immediately,” says Ross Robertson.</p>
