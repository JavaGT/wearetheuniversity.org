<p>New Zealand Air Guitar Champion Wants To Bring The World Championship Home Where It Belongs</p>
<p>The 2009 New Zealand Air Guitar Champion &amp; 2nd place winner of the Australasian Air Guitar Champs, Louis Ewen aka “Gat Rockin’ Randy Reaper” is going to make it to the World Championships to bring home the gold for New Zealand.</p>
<p>Auckland, New Zealand. June 17, 2009 - On Saturday 13th June 2009, Louis Ewen a 21-year-old retail worker from Waitakere City, West Auckland transformed into his alter ego “Gat Rockin’ Randy Reaper” the current New Zealand Air Guitar Champion, and took on nine Australians to gain a very respectable second place in the Australia/New Zealand Air Guitar competition.</p>
<p>Louis first competed in the New Zealand Air Guitar Championships in 2008 and made it into the New Zealand final as a wildcard entry. He came 4th in the competition that year and knew that he had to take it to the next level to achieve his dream in 2009. As a natural musician and performer, Louis practiced his routine and honed his air guitar skills to perfection to take out the NZ Championship on May 1st at Vesbar, AUT University.</p>
<p>The Air Guitar World Championships were first organised in Oulu, Finland in 1996 and have been running ever since. The idea that was once thought to be so absurd has transformed into an international media sensation, attracting a number of contestants and concertgoers from all around the globe.</p>
<p>The Australia New Zealand Air Guitar Championships, held in the Australian Capital Canberra, were won by the 2006 &amp; 2008 defending Australian Air Guitar Champion Clay Connolly aka ‘Clay Bangers’.</p>

<p>The ten competitors put on an amazing performance showing of their outrageous air antics to impress the judges and the large audience in attendance at the Canberra Irish Club.</p>
<p>Although Louis did not win the Australia/New Zealand title, and the grand prize of a trip to represent Australasia in the Air Guitar World Championships in Oulu, Finland in August, he is still eligible to represent New Zealand in the competition. His dream is to have the world title back in New Zealand hands, so he has begun to seek sponsorship and donations to help make this dream become a reality.</p>
<p>“To be the World Air Guitar Champion would mean the world to me”, says Louis, “but more importantly, I want to do this for New Zealand and for Kiwi pride”. For anyone who wants to be involved in supporting Louis, in anyway, please contact <a href="mailto:carl.ewen@aut.ac.nz">carl.ewen@aut.ac.nz</a> for more information.</p>
<p>&quot;The purpose of the Air Guitar World Championships is to promote world peace. According to the ideology of the Air Guitar, war’s end, climate change stops and all bad things disappear, if all the people in the world played the Air Guitar. This is why the whole universe is invited to play the Air Guitar for the world peace at the end of the competition.&quot; - Air Guitar World Championships Website.</p>
