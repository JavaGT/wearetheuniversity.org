<p>Football Game A Chance For Community To Come Together</p>
<p>Labour Wellington Central MP Grant Robertson will host a screening of the Confederations Cup football game between New Zealand and Iraq this Sunday morning at the New Crossways Community Centre in Mt Victoria. The game starts at 6.30am.</p>
<p>“This is a chance for the members of the Iraqi community in Wellington, and other football fans to come together to celebrate the first time teams from our two countries have played each other on the world stage.” Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>“The idea for a screening came from conversations I had with members of the Iraqi community. They are mad keen on football, and especially if Iraq is playing. Not all of them would have access to Sky TV to view the coverage, so this was a chance for them to come together to view the game.”</p>
<p>“Also it is a chance for them to make connections with football clubs from around Wellington. There will be representatives from Soccer Wellington and football clubs in town who will be attending the screening. This is one small opportunity to help the Iraqi community to feel more and more part of the wider community in Wellington.”</p>
<p>“Neither New Zealand nor Iraq has had a great run at the Confederations Cup, so this game represents a chance to gain something out of the tournament. I think it will be a great event, and I am sure we will get a great turnout.”</p>
<p>Those interested in attending are asked to RSVP to Grant Robertson’s electorate office (04) 801-8079 or <a href="mailto:office@grantrobertson.co.nz">office@grantrobertson.co.nz</a>. Light refreshments will be provided.</p>
