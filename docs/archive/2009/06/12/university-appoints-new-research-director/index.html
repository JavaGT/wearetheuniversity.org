<p>Friday 12 June 2009<br> <br>University appoints new Research Director<br> <br>A scientist who has forged important international linkages for New Zealand’s science system has been appointed as the University of Otago’s new Director (Research).<br> <br>Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research &amp; Enterprise) Professor Harlene Hayne says she is delighted that Dr Brian Young has taken up the position, which involves providing strategic leadership to maximise the University’s research performance and external research income.<br> <br>“Dr Young’s background makes him an ideal person to help lead Otago’s efforts to enhance our existing status as New Zealand’s most research-intensive university. He brings a wealth of skills, knowledge and experience to the role, including an extensive understanding of public and private sector research funding systems in New Zealand and the United States,” Professor Hayne says.<br> <br>In 2004, Dr Young was appointed as New Zealand’s first Science and Technology Counsellor to the United States, a position established by the Ministry for Research, Science and Technology (MoRST).<br> <br>Based in Washington DC, his work focused on developing research linkages and establishing networks of contacts in the US research, science and technology system. He was also tasked with identifying opportunities for funding, collaborative research and access to research facilities not available in New Zealand.<br> <br>During his four years in the role, Dr Young developed numerous strategic initiatives and negotiated New Zealand’s inclusion in a number of bilateral and multilateral funding and research schemes. These included the Human Frontier Science Programme Organization and the US National Science Foundation’s East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes.<br> <br>“As well as pursuing this country’s scientific and science funding interests in the US at a high governmental level, Dr Young also has a strong record as a researcher working in the New Zealand science system,” Professor Hayne says.<br> <br>Before taking up the MoRST role, Dr Young was a senior scientist at the Crown Research Institute HortResearch, leading a multidisciplinary research team investigating a variety of basic and applied research problems.<br> <br>He gained a first class honours degree in Psychology from the University of Canterbury, and a PhD in Behavioural Neuroscience from Dartmouth College, a prestigious US Ivy League university. He went on to hold a Foundation for Research, Science and Technology Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Otago from 1995-98.<br> <br>Dr Young says that it is wonderful to be back working in a research environment, and particularly in an institution of Otago’s calibre.  <br> <br>“I very much look forward to working with the Research and Enterprise Office team to facilitate funding of the research that provides important public good, economic and intellectual benefits,” Dr Young says.<br> <br>He took up his position at the University this week.<br> <br>ends</p>
