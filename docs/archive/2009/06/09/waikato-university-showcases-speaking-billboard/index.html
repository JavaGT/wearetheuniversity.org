<p>Waikato University showcases ‘speaking billboard’ at Fieldays</p>
<p>Visitors to this week’s National Agricultural Fieldays may find themselves assailed by a newly-developed ‘speaking billboard’ promoting the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>Passersby will activate a movement sensor in the free-standing signboard, triggering one of a series of recorded messages about the University, which is once again a Fieldays strategic partner.</p>
<p>The messages include a promotion for the University’s seminar series, being held in the Services Building, which will feature academics and other experts from around the Waikato talking about topics relevant to land-based industries.</p>
<p>The ‘active advertising’ device has been developed by University of Waikato student Steven Kane during a summer work placement at local electronic product developer Novel Ways.</p>
<p>“The big challenge was starting with just an idea and ending up with something that worked – all in 10 weeks,” says Kane, a former Hamilton Boys’ High student who’s now in his Bachelor of Engineering honours year at Waikato, majoring in electronics.</p>
<p>During his placement, funded through a government Technology Internship, Kane had to research and develop components and devices, and learn how to programme so he could build the whole circuit. “Then I had to build it again after a lot of modifications!”</p>
<p>The device has already been successfully trialled outside sporting goods retailer R&amp;R Sport in Hamilton. Manager Wayne Addison said the response from customers was very positive. “Advertising is always difficult to measure – you don’t know if you’re getting value for money. The cool thing about this device is that someone can walk in and say ‘I heard the message’.”</p>
<p>Novel Ways director Graham Lynch says Kane has done a great job, and he’s currently applying for a patent for the device. “If we think there might be a market for a new product, we’ll give it a go,” he says. “We’re aiming it at bigger retailers, ones who’ve already got their own radio ads and posters. It’s a way for them to ‘top up’ their advertising using what they’ve already got.”</p>
<p>Kane says the work placement has given him a better idea of what he might do after he graduates. “I really like the idea of producing niche products for the electronic industry,” he says. “I’ve always been full of ideas and in this industry I’m able to explore where those ideas can take me.”<br>ends</p>
