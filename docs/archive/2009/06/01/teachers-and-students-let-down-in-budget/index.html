<p><strong>Monday, 1 June 2009, 4:32 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sue Moroney<br>Labour spokesperson for Early Childhood Development</strong></p>
<p><strong>Teachers and students let down in Budget</strong></p>
<p>The National Government has taken the knife to four professional development programmes for early childhood education, Labour Early Education Spokesperson Sue Moroney says.</p>
<p>“These development programmes aim to keep New Zealand at the leading edge of the quality of the education we offer to our young children,” Sue Moroney said.</p>
<p>The programmes that have been cut - Centres of Innovation, the implementation of ECE exemplars to develop effective assessment practises, the ECE Advisory Training/Education Fund which was used to strengthen teaching practise and the ECE ICT Framework which worked on the benefits to ECE services of using ICT.</p>
<p>“This saves a measly $9.8m over four years but puts future professional development at risk.</p>
<p>“The National Government are failing to fund initiatives that will have long-term benefits in Early Childhood Education.</p>
<p>“To deliver the best education to our youngest New Zealanders we need to be investing in teachers as well as students.</p>
<p>“The Government has also failed to put any additional funding into increasing participation of children in early childhood education, despite claiming this being their top priority.</p>
<p>“They have scraped $275 million out of the ECE budget that was dedicated to improving staff/child ratios.</p>
<p>“National bragged about moving resources from the backroom to the frontline, but what they are really doing is slashing programmes that focus on long-term development,” Sue Moroney said.</p>
