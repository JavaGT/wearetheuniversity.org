<p>9 June 2009<br>Media Statement</p>
<p>Labour recognises the contribution of school support staff</p>
<p>Labour today paid tribute to the work of school support staff who provide essential assistance to young New Zealanders, Labour Women’s Affairs spokesperson Sue Moroney says.</p>
<p>“School support staff; include teacher aides, librarians, nurses, and sports co-coordinators, these staff are an essential part of a school’s ability to provide children with a well rounded education,” Sue Moroney said.</p>
<p>“State Services Minister Tony Ryall has cancelled an investigation into pay equity for support workers, his justification being that he didn’t want his government to have to pay for increased wages that might result if it were completed.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, many school support workers earn just above the minimum wage, and there appears to be little inclination from the National Government to improve this.</p>
<p>“National has talked big about moving resources to the frontline, but so far that has not included providing for improved wages for these valuable staff.</p>
<p>“Today Minister of Women’s Affairs Pansy Wong said her government was committed to addressing the issue of pay equity. Sadly the actions of her government prove otherwise.</p>
<p>“School support staff, the majority of whom are women, deserve to have their contributions valued and acknowledged. Unfortunately the current government appear determined to ignore pay equity issues.</p>
<p>“The recession should not be used as an excuse to keep wages unfairly low.</p>
<p>“The work of thousands of school support staff will be celebrated in communities around the country on June 10, and I urge Education Minister Anne Tolley and Women’s Affairs Minister Pansy Wong to prioritise the issue of low wages for these workers,” Sue Moroney said.</p>
