<p>Communities</p>
<p>In the last few weeks I have been travelling around the communities of Mt Albert.</p>
<p>I’ve had the opportunity to meet a lot of people.</p>
<p>And the theme that has come up again and again is that Mt Albert people want this to be about communities.</p>
<p>We have been listening to people while others came in and played politics.</p>
<p>The difference between us and them is that the others wouldn’t listen to what the community wanted.</p>
<p>They imposed their motorway.</p>
<p>And they wouldn’t let the community have a say on the future of the Super City.</p>
<p>This is about listening and about strong communities.</p>
<p>I support strong regional government, but I also support a form of government that makes for stronger communities.</p>
<p>A giant super city with no adequate community representation won’t work for communities.</p>
<p>A strong layer of regional government is needed for regional parks.</p>
<p>It’s needed for an integrated transport system - one where you can buy a single ticket to get across the city on a train, bus or ferry.</p>
<p>A transport system that better uses our rail corridors and moves more commuter traffic off roads.</p>
<p>This is the strong regional government that I support.</p>
<p>It’s not what we’ve been given in the government’s proposal.</p>
<p>The government has made some big promises.</p>
<p>But let’s look at those promises.</p>

<p>John Banks is the mayor who the Prime Minister endorsed on the weekend - he went to the National Party conference and said John Banks is National’s choice for super mayor.</p>
<p>John Banks has talked about cutting 2700 jobs, or forty per cent of current staff.</p>
<p>But if you cut 2700 jobs, you are going to cut services.</p>
<p>That is the wrong thing to do in the teeth of a global recession.</p>
<p>We should be finding the best ways to make sure everyone contributes to the recovery - not throwing them out of work.</p>
<p>They have said the super city will be more efficient because it is bigger.</p>
<p>But bigger is not always better</p>
<p>I don’t buy that bigger agencies are necessarily more efficient. Often, they are less efficient.</p>
<p>If you want a good example, the members of the Transition Agency are being paid a thousand dollars a day.</p>
<p>The chairman will be paid nearly six hundred thousand dollars a year.</p>
<p>By way of comparison - there are not many councillors who are paid a thousand dollars a year.</p>
<p>And there are no mayors at all who are paid more than the average wage every month.</p>
<p>That’s more than the prime minister is paid.</p>
<p>And unless you are very careful about representation, the bigger an organisation is, the less responsive it is.</p>
<p>I’ve just come from the UN - if there’s one thing I have had experience with it’s managing people in large organisations.</p>
<p>I had a budget of about two billion dollars rebuilding schools and hospitals and communities.</p>
<p>The new city will have a similar budget.</p>
<p>I have seen how large organisations can easily produce waste and inefficiency.</p>
<p>The promises they are making of gains are far in the future but the costs will not be.</p>
<p>I talked to an economist from Auckland University who crunched the numbers.</p>
<p>She found the costs of adjustment far outweigh any savings.</p>
<p>She put the transition costs at between $574 and $753 per household.</p>
<p>National hasn’t costed the transition.</p>
<p>Just about the only numbers you will find in the National Party costing - are the page numbers.</p>
<p>The Royal Commission came back with a long and detailed report. And the National Party replaced all of that with a pamphlet.</p>
<p>The same economist I spoke to said there would be between 539 and 817 jobs lost as a result of the transition - and that level could be accommodated through gradual attrition.</p>
<p>The problem with the Super City is that you are never going to get a chance to have a say about any of this.</p>
<p>The National Government has already passed the law that replaced elected representatives in Auckland with its own panel of selected people</p>
<p>If you don’t get a chance to have your say in a referendum, then they won’t make sure the proposal is adequate enough to pass the approval of most Aucklanders.</p>
<p>Only this morning you can see in the news Rodney Hide has been talking about his plan for the future of local government.</p>
<p>He says he wants councils out of social and environmental work.</p>
<p>That means councils will have nothing to do with cleaning up Oakley stream or Meola Creek.<br>Environment will be nothing to do with local councils.</p>
<p>It means there won’t be local community centres and recreation centres.</p>
<p>What will happen to crime rates when councils no longer have any role in helping create a place where young people can go to hang out? There is an old saying that the devil makes work for idle hands.</p>
<p>No social role means no local swimming pools and cultural events, from santa parades to festivals.</p>
<p>You won’t even be able to vote for any of it.</p>
<p>This is the policy of the National Act government.</p>
<p>It’s being rammed through now.</p>
<p>And then the government says - we’ll give you a lot more referenda on local issues.</p>
<p>How about a referendum on the Super City?</p>
<p>We say Auckland should have a say.</p>
<p>We say Auckland should be listened to.</p>
<p>We say communities should be supported, and that takes strong local representation.</p>
