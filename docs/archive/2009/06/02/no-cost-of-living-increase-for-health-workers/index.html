<p>2 June 2009 Media Statement</p>
<p>Minister confirms no cost of living increase for frontline health workers</p>
<p>Minister of Health Tony Ryall has confirmed that there will be no increases in salaries for frontline health workers under his Government, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.</p>
<p>“Doctors, nurses, midwives and other frontline health workers will not even be receiving cost of living increases under the current Government, Tony Ryall confirmed in Parliament today,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>“This decision will drive increasing number of doctors and nurses overseas, making workforce shortages even worse.</p>
<p>“This year’s Budget made no allowance for salary increases for health workers or for increasing numbers of frontline health workers.</p>
<p>“This short-sighted approach means that the gap between medical salaries paid in New Zealand and overseas will widen, ensuring that our best and brightest medical graduates head offshore.</p>
<p>“This is a ridiculous decision by a Minister who has clearly failed to grasp long-term health issues, such as the importance of public health and the retention of medical staff.</p>
<p>“As workforce shortages increase, health services will be cut and it will be New Zealanders who will be worse off.<br>“If the Government can make $50 million available for a cycleway then surely it can make money available to pay our doctors and nurses a cost of living increase.”</p>
<p>Ms Dyson said increasing numbers of medical students in training, is pointless if you do not pay them the salaries they can earn elsewhere.</p>

<p>“This is not about paying enormous salaries during a recession. It’s about ensuring that salaries for New Zealand trained medical professionals are attractive enough to keep them here and ensure the continuity of health services.</p>
<p>“Services are already being cut under this Government. Southland and Otago DHBs are looking at home support service cuts of around $10 million as a result of Tony Ryall&#39;s letter of expectation to those DHBs , West Coast is struggling to attract enough staff to maintain current services and Wairarapa DHB is looking at service reductions.</p>
<p>“There has been just six months of a National Government, yet service cuts are already a reality for many regions and they will only get worse,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
