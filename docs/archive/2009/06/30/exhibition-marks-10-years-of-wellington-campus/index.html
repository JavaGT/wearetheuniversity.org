<p><strong>Monday, June 29, 2009</strong><br><strong>Exhibition marks 10 years of Wellington campus</strong></p>
<p>Massey’s Wellington campus will this week celebrate its first decade with an exhibition showcasing some of the best work of students and staff, and a photographic display featuring the construction and refurbishment of the landmark Museum building, which has become the campus&#39; defining feature.</p>
<p>The Buckle St building has been indelibly associated with Massey Wellington since the campus came into being through a merger with Wellington Polytechnic on July 1, 1999.</p>
<p>The story of its restoration is one of the exhibition highlights which features a display of more than 30 photographs telling the story of the Museum Building’s construction, occupancy, refurbishment and rejuvenation when it became the home of the university’s College of Creative Arts.</p>
<p>But all of the university’s four colleges are represented at the exhibition, which is open to the public from Wednesday till Sunday, and showcases through video and static displays top teaching and research at the university. It also provides an opportunity to view plans for the future of the campus.</p>

<p>The exhibition is being sponsored by Fletcher Construction, which built the Museum Building in the 1930s and led its restoration in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>Massey’s Wellington Regional Chief Executive Professor Andrea McIlroy said the venue was apt for the exhibition, which has also received support from the National Library, given its lengthy association with the wider Wellington public.</p>
<p>In the past decade that connection had also become indelibly linked with the university too, she said.</p>
<p>“We work with business and industry and the arts community, and focus on career opportunities for our graduates.</p>
<p>“We pride ourselves on being a friendly campus; and in the coming years, exciting new building projects will enhance our facilities for students and staff.”</p>
<p><strong>The exhibition <em>Past, Present and Future</em> is being staged in the Museum Building, Buckle St, Wellington from July 1-5, 10am-4pm.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Guided tours of the building will be held daily at 11am and 2pm.</strong></p>
