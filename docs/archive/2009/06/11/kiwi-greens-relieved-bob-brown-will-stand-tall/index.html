<p>Kiwi Greens relieved Bob Brown will stand tall</p>
<p>“We are delighted to learn that over a thousand donations have been received and that Senator Brown now has the money to avoid bankruptcy. Consequently his leadership of the Greens in the Senate is safe,” said Green Party MP Jeanette Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons was horrified to discover earlier this week that Mr Brown’s Senate seat was in jeopardy because of his efforts in the public interest to save the Wielangta forest in Tasmania.</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons has known Bob for decades, and the Green parties on each side of the Tasman regularly cooperate to achieve better protection for the environment.</p>
<p>“The public response shows the power of the numerous people who care deeply about endangered species and the magnificent old-growth forests that get turned into toilet paper.</p>
<p>“Senator Brown said to me on the phone that he was humbled at the level of peoples’ passion to protect Tasmania’s remaining forests. I also think it shows the degree to which the public, whether voting Green or not, appreciate the presence of the Green Party in Parliament,” Ms Fitzsimons said.</p>
<p>Senator Brown also told me that he had many people sending money who said they are not Green voters but wish to help because they think the legislation and Court processes were so outrageous, said Ms Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons paid tribute to Bob’s work: “He has worked all his life to protect forests, putting his life at risk in front of bulldozers and auctioning his belongings to fund a case to protect endangered species.”</p>

<p>“He has won real gains for the environment, but at huge personal cost.</p>
<p>“The Greens here in New Zealand support him to the hilt: I phoned him last night and we have made a financial contribution too.”</p>
<p>Bob Brown’s website reports the breaking news that: “Due to an overwhelming public response, Senator Brown will be able to cover his Forestry Tasmania legal bill this week. Bob would like to thank everybody who has been and continue to be so generous.”</p>
<p>“Bullying corporates and governments everywhere should know that you cannot keep a good man down – and Bob is much much more than just a good man,” Ms Fitzsimons said.</p>
