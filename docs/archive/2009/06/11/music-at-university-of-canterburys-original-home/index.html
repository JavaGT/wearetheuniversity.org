<p>A national stage for music at University of Canterbury’s original home</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury could be returning to its original home in central Christchurch and establishing New Zealand’s first National Conservatorium of Music in a new purpose-built facility at the Christchurch Arts Centre.</p>
<p>The Christchurch City Council has agreed to investigate the feasibility of building the new conservatorium on the Arts Centre’s Hereford Street car park site and entering a long-term rental agreement with the University.</p>
<p>It has been designed by Sir Miles Warren and Warren &amp; Mahoney in a style that complements existing buildings, none of which would be impacted by the new structure. Images attached.</p>
<p>The University would be responsible for fitting-out the new building. It would pay construction costs through lease payments and fund the running of the music programme.</p>
<p>The conservatorium would be occupied by staff and students from the University’s School of Music, and be a national leader in music performance and education.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr describes the University’s proposal as an investment in education, economic development and cultural enrichment.</p>
<p>“While this would see the University’s music programme back where it all started in 1891, we are motivated by more than just sentiment. Having our staff and students working, studying and performing in the centre of town would add to its vibrancy, attract more visitors and provide significant spin-offs for businesses in the inner city.”</p>

<p>UC’s School of Music has been in need of new facilities for a number of years. The University believes its ability to keep attracting high quality staff and students will be limited if new facilities are not developed.</p>
<p>“Our preference is for these facilities to be in the inner city at the Arts Centre given it is the original site of the University and the centre of Christchurch’s cultural life. The Council, which wants to revitalise the central city, supports our initiative and is willing to do what it can to make that happen,” Dr Carr says.</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury occupied the Arts Centre site from 1873 until 1974. The site was leased to the Arts Centre of Christchurch Society in 1976 and subsequently gifted to the Arts Centre Trust.</p>
<p>The University has been working on the development of the conservatorium proposal with the Arts Centre Trust Board. Given the scale and long-term nature of the project it has also entered discussions with the Christchurch City Council.</p>
<p>Christchurch mayor Bob Parker says the Council is considering how it could assist.</p>
<p>“Given our commitment to revitalising the central city this proposal could certainly have merit. For a long time I’ve been talking about the benefits of the University having a presence again in the inner city. The University is showing foresight with this proposal,” Mr Parker says.</p>
<p>Under the proposal the Council would lease the land from the Arts Centre Trust Board and construct the building, leasing it back to the University under a long term rental agreement. The Council has been briefed on the proposal this week (June 8), with a report likely to come before the Council next month. Mr Parker says nothing will happen without agreement from the Arts Centre Trust Board.</p>
