<p><strong>Tuesday, 15 September 2009, 3:09 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>OUSA Women’s Week</p>
<p>Do women still need their own representative on the OUSA Executive? That is what OUSA members will be arguing at tomorrow’s debate.</p>
<p>“Some people believe there is no need for a Women’s Rep because the big questions of women’s rights have been dealt with; others believe issues apply to both men and women and would prefer to see a Gender Rep on OUSA” says OUSA Women’s Representative Claire Jackson.</p>
<p>The debate, in the University Union Main Common Room at 1pm tomorrow 16 Sep is part of this year’s OUSA Women’s Week.</p>
<p>In addition to a good old fashioned argument, women can celebrate the week by attending the Women in Business networking happy hour on Thursday at 5pm in the 2ndfloor staff room of the Commerce Building.</p>
<p>Or learning how to defend themselves in some tricky situations with the help of self-defence instructor Ana Pereira at 1pm and 2pm at the Clubs and Societies Centre on Friday.</p>
<p>Women’s health is not neglected during the week – young women on campus will be encouraged to get pap smears by way of “I heart my cervix” free chocolates.</p>
<p>OUSA Women’s Week runs from Monday 14 to Friday 18 September.</p>
