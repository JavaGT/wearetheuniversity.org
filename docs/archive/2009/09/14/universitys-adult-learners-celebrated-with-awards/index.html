<p>University’s adult learners celebrated with awards</p>
<p>A music composition student, a trainee teacher and a video maker are among this year’s winners of the University of Waikato Vice Chancellor’s Adult Learners Awards.</p>
<p>First offered in 2001, the awards are intended to encourage more adults to access learning opportunities and to celebrate the efforts, achievements and contributions of adult learners.</p>
<p>Jennifer Spark, Jenny McPherson, Pippa Russell and Ruth Smith received awards of $1,000 each at a ceremony last week (Adult Learners Week) hosted by the Director of the University’s Pathways College, Professor Brian Findsen.</p>
<p>Prof Findsen said mature-age students are an asset to tertiary education institutions. “Universities benefit from having older students amongst school leavers because mature students enrich the teaching-learning environment. Typically they bring extensive life experience which astute teachers can link to the curriculum; they have a more developed sense of self and a very strong motivation to achieve.”</p>
<p>All award winners have maintained very high academic standards in their studies, while juggling work and family commitments.</p>
<p>Jennifer Spark has overcome challenging health issues to return to full-time music study, and has this year been awarded a prestigious Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship as well as a scholarship from Arts Waikato.</p>
<p>Mother of three Jenny McPherson is combining teacher training with a degree in English – and holds down a part-time job as a teaching assistant for special needs students, while playing an active role in her community.</p>

<p>A single parent with four children, Pippa Russell is studying full-time for a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in both Screen &amp; Media and Religious Studies, as well as juggling part-time work for GreenUp. She also finds time to volunteer in the local arts community, and has had her video work publicly exhibited.</p>
<p>Ruth Smith (Ngati Kahungunu) left school after failing to get good enough grades to go on to university. This year, she’s achieved A grades in two Masters level papers as part of a Postgraduate Diploma, majoring in Strategic Management. A single mother of two, Ruth also works part-time as a mentor to Maori students, and is currently undertaking research on role of support among Maori students.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato has more than 4,880 adult learners, defined as students over the age of 25, who make up 38% of the student body.</p>
