<p><strong>Car-seat inserts and dummies could save babies’ lives</strong></p>
<p>New research indicates that placing a foam plastic insert in standard car-seats and capsules reduces ‘stop breathing’ episodes for premature and full-term babies.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Auckland have found placing an insert in infant car-seats helps babies’ upper airways to stay open and they expect their findings to lead to a review of the design.</p>
<p>Infant car-seat use is essential for all babies traveling in cars to prevent serious injury in an accident. However, some babies experience breathing problems while asleep in car seats.</p>
<p>“Our research shows the combination of a baby’s large head and the flat sloping surface of a car seat pushes the baby’s chin and tongue backwards, causing narrowing of the upper airway passage. This can cause low blood oxygen levels and even lead to a complete block of breathing,” GP and Research Fellow, Dr McIntosh said.</p>
<p>“Placing an insert with a hollow for the baby’s head in a car seat, pushes the baby’s back forward a little - while accommodating the bulge at the back of the baby’s head - and allows the upper airway to stay open. This reduces the number of episodes of oxygen drop and ‘stop breathing’ spells.”</p>
<p>Dr McIntosh, who spoke at the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners (RNZCGP) conference last week, said scientists had long held the belief that dummies (pacifiers) ‘protect’ against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).</p>
<p>However, until now it has not been known why.</p>

<p>“Past studies indicate SIDS may be caused due to a narrowing, or blocking, of the upper-airway passage. Our research has shown when a baby sucks on a dummy the reverse happens - its airway enlarges as the dummy pushes its jaw forward.”</p>
<p>Dr McIntosh also emphasised the importance of protecting babies’ airways whenever they are asleep.</p>
<p>“When an infant that has been sleeping in the same bed as a parent or sibling dies, it is usually assumed the baby was accidentally over-layed or smothered.</p>
<p>“This may be the case, but our findings indicate death could also occur because the baby has slumped down on a pillow or parent’s arm, or been trapped in a hollow in the bed - narrowing their airway.”</p>
<p>Dr McIntosh said the safest way for a baby to sleep is on a flat mattress without a pillow, on its back and in its own sleeping space – a cot next to a parents’ bed is the safest of all places. Babies should not be left to sleep in car-seats when they are out of the car.</p>
<p>Dr McIntosh presented her findings at the RNZCGP conference held last week in Wellington.</p>
