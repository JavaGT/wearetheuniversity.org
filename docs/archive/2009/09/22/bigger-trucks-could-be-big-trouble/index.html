<p>Bigger trucks could be big trouble</p>
<p>Bigger trucks will make at least 620,000 trips on our roads each year meaning drivers should brace themselves for more road carnage, and more road damage, Green Party Associate Transport spokesperson Sue Kedgley said today.</p>
<p>“Truck operators have sought permission to carry 33 million tonnes of freight a year by huge, 53 tonne, 72 foot trucks. If the Minister of Transport approves a pending rule change, we can expect to see at least 620,000 trips by heavy trucks a year on our roads,” said Ms Kedgley.</p>
<p>“This is an alarming number of trips by heavy trucks, and it will have a devastating impact on our roads, on the road toll, and on the viability of rail and coastal shipping.”</p>
<p>&quot;Already trucks are involved in 18 percent of all deaths on the roads, even though they comprise only four percent of the vehicle fleet. Imagine what will happen to the road toll if thousands of heavy trucks are allowed on our roads.&quot;</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of journeys in 53 tonne trucks will exponentially increase the damage to our roads. However, the Government’s recently released National Land Transport Programme reveals declining maintenance budgets for state highways over the next three years while the budget for local roads is remaining flat.</p>
<p>“If Central Government has made no allowance for increased wear and tear, who will be picking up the bill? Local ratepayers?”</p>
<p>Freight volumes are forecast to grow by around 75 percent between 2006 and 2030 and the vast bulk would go by heavy truck unless Transport Minister Steven Joyce directs his Ministry to take a more strategic look at moving freight by more sustainable alternatives.</p>
<p>“Rail freight and coastal shipping are more sustainable, safe, and energy efficient modes for moving freight. Yet there has, to date, been no analysis of how allowing bigger trucks will undermine our rail and sea freight systems,” added Ms Kedgley.</p>
<p>In a report from the Treasury obtained under the Official Information Act, Treasury does not recommend a lifting on the restriction of heavy vehicle limits “until a more detailed analysis has been undertaken which considers the broader costs and benefits”.</p>
<p>“Potential short-term productivity gains should not blind the Minister into taking a more strategic view of our transport networks,” said Ms Kedgley.</p>
