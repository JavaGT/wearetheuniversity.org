<p><strong>Tuesday, 22 September 2009, 2:56 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Trevor Mallard<br><strong>Education Spokesperson</strong><br>22 September 2009 <strong>Media Statement</strong><br><strong>Mallard welcomes Law Commission report on private schools</strong></p>
<p>A Law Commission report issued today shows the law governing private schools needs to be brought up to date to ensure the schools meet accepted education standards, Labour’s education spokesman Trevor Mallard said today.</p>
<p>The report, Private Schools and the Law, describes legislation governing private schools as “vague” and “past its use by date”, Mr Mallard said.</p>
<p>“I welcome this report, which highlights that the law is 90 years old and needs an overhaul.</p>
<p>“As Law Commission President Sir Geoffrey Palmer points out, there are some ‘serious gaps’ in the legislation.</p>
<p>“There are no restrictions on who can set up a school, including people with a serious criminal record, no obligation to look after students’ welfare, and a lack of flexibility in how to deal with schools that are not meeting minimum standards.</p>
<p>“Private schools have existed in New Zealand for many years. It is important that they are guided by laws which ensure students who attend them have the same protections and rights as students in state schools,” Trevor Mallard said.</p>
