<p><strong>Tuesday, 22 September 2009, 4:32 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Government’s ACE claims under the spotlight</p>
<p>The Government must explain how it reconciles community claims that NZ Sign Language, other language learning courses for deaf people and ESOL courses will be axed despite its assurances to the contrary, says Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Maryan Street.</p>
<p>“Today in Parliament, Labour raised three different examples of community groups and educators telling us these courses would be canned because of Budget cuts to adult and community education. Finance Minister Bill English responded each time that these claims were wrong.</p>
<p>“Well something is definitely wrong. What is clear is that not only was the Government’s decision to slash ACE funding foolish, but its handling of the matter has been shambolic. We’ve got Ministers saying ‘no cuts’ for these courses and the people on the ground saying they will have to be axed,” Maryan Street.</p>
<p>“Anne Tolley ridiculed my colleague Lynne Pillay in June when she raised concerns the cuts would see courses for New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) shut down. The Minister denied this in Parliament saying on June 25 ‘this is absolutely not the case….that is scaremongering of the worst kind’,</p>
<p>“Yet I have been told that NZSL classes at a number of schools will be axed next year, because of the funding cuts. Those schools include Mairehau High School (Christchurch), Taieri College (Dunedin), Kelston Boys’ High School (Auckland) and Tamatea High School (Napier). Others have signalled they may also be forced to do the same,” Maryan Street said.</p>

<p>“And I tabled a letter in Parliament today from the Hearing Association of Wellington, which is very concerned that funding for courses in speech reading and lip reading for the deaf and hearing impaired provided through Wellington High School has been canned next year,” said Rongotai MP Annette King.</p>
<p>“The confusion only deepened, when Bill English disputed the veracity of a letter from Auckland Regional Migrant Services claiming English language programmes (ESOL) for new migrants would be cut. Something is wrong and Anne Tolley and Bill English have some serious explaining to do,” Maryan Street said.</p>
