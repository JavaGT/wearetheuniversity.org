<p>One Step Closer To VSM</p>
<p>Students are now one step closer to being free following the passage of my Education (Freedom Of Association) Bill through First Reading, ACT New Zealand MP Sir Roger Douglas said today.</p>
<p>“For almost 20 years, no other group of individuals has been forced to join an association –unfortunately students are the exception,” Sir Roger said.</p>
<p>“The idea that people should be forced to join unions has lost support over the years as people recognised that it’s a violation of individual freedom of association. Many students are forced into students’ associations that do not represent their views, waste money on administration costs, and indulge in resource mismanagement for personal gain.</p>
<p>“The argument that students currently have choice is misleading. Students that oppose compulsory unionisation are told they can ‘conscientiously object’, yet many are rejected on the grounds that their philosophical objections are not strong enough to justify them leaving the organisation.</p>
<p>“Further, even in the cases where students have successfully left the students’association, the compulsory-acquired fees are left with the association, and it is therefore taxation with our representation.</p>
<p>“If students’associations really do such a good job – as they claim – they will have little difficulty attracting students to join. My Bill will ensure that students are free to choose for themselves,” Sir Roger said.</p>
