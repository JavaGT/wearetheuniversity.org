<p>Investors need not lose sleep over daylight saving</p>
<p>The changeover to and from daylight saving does not have a detrimental effect on financial markets, according to new research.</p>
<p>While previous studies suggested stock markets weakened on the Monday after daylight saving began or finished, possibly due to the effect on investors&#39; sleep patterns, Massey finance specialists and a Dutch research colleague have produced a paper showing there is no discernable impact.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Russell Gregory-Allen, Professor Ben Jacobsen and Wessel Marquering of Erasmus University in the Netherlands found that sharemarket returns in 22 countries were no different from any other day.</p>
<p>“The results reject earlier conclusions that a change in the mood of investors as a result of changes in sleep patterns significantly affects stock returns,&quot; Dr Gregory-Allen says.</p>
<p>They researched more than five times the number of countries included in any previous studies on the subject, he says. “The only way to really know is to look at a large number of countries whose daylight saving changeover day is different, so we have looked at countries from New Zealand and Denmark to Spain and the United States.”</p>
<p>Their report has been accepted for publication in the international Journal of Financial Research. New Zealand Daylight Saving starts at 2am on Sunday, when clocks go forward an hour.</p>
