<p><strong>Thursday, 24 September 2009, 3:16 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>24 September 2009<br>Media Statement</p>
<p>Accelerator or brake? Health is not a toy Mr Ryall</p>
<p>Minister of Health Tony Ryall’s latest attempt to dazzle the public with additional cardiac surgery figures in Auckland is unsustainable given the strange accelerator and brake signals he sends to health sector staff, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.</p>
<p>“I am delighted there has been an increase in cardiac surgery figures for Auckland but the health sector and the staff who work so hard in it are not toys.</p>
<p>“Rushing resources to one spot to get a good headline at the same time that you put the freeze on in others is disrespectful. The public health sector tries to deliver for ALL New Zealanders,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>“This confusing mix of accelerator and brake, reward and deprive, is sending alarm bells ringing through the sector. What is good news for Auckland people today should be seen in parallel with cuts elsewhere in the country and the reality of specialist cardiac staff leaving New Zealand as they face a 5-year salary freeze.</p>
<p>“In the May Budget I pointed out there was no allowance for salary increases for health workers or for increasing numbers of frontline health workers. By June Mr Ryall confirmed that there will be no increases in salaries for frontline health workers.</p>
<p>“In August, with his State Services hat on, Mr Ryall meddled in pay negotiations in the education sector and yesterday Bill English confirmed the country&#39;s 44,000 public servants face a virtual five-year pay freeze, despite the recession being officially over.</p>

<p>“Mr Ryall has made repeated statements about his health policy being Better Sooner and More Convenient and how he will trust and value our health professionals.</p>
<p>“The National Party campaigned on listening to frontline health professionals. Clearly they had no intention of actually doing it – Tony Ryall’s recent comments to the Australasian College of Emergency Medicine conference that ‘the new government wants a new partnership with the health professions. We will not see you as costs, but as a valuable resource’ are just hollow,”Ruth Dyson said.</p>
