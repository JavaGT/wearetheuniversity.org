<p>Thursday, September 17, 2009<br>Study pods and more for Albany library extension</p>
<p>Study pods designed for collaborative group work are among the state-of-the-art features of a new library extension that will more than triple the size of the library on the Albany campus.</p>
<p>The first stage will open in November, and the second stage early next year when the existing building is refitted and linked to the new.</p>
<p>Other features include a parents’ room, group study rooms, cafe, expanded information commons, combined lending and information desks, new special collections of Maori and Pasifika material, additional individual study spaces and thousands more books brought out of storage.</p>
<p>The five-storey building was designed by Opus Architecture and is being constructed by Mainzeal. It will have more private group study rooms – popular with students working collaboratively ¬– and more individual study spaces.</p>
<p>“People increasingly see the library as a social place,&quot; says campus librarian Valerie Cohen. &quot;We are responding to how students want to work,” she says.</p>
<p>The combined buildings will comprise 7000 square metres, house more than 100,000 books, 1000 study spaces and about 150 computers. Dedicated study space for postgraduate students – who make up just over 30 per cent of the total students at Albany – will also be part of the new complex.</p>
<p>With noisy drilling on the new building all but over, students and staff in the existing library will not need to use the free earplugs on offer much longer, says Mrs Cohen.</p>
