<p><strong>Monday, 21 September 2009, 12:33 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>**Media release for immediate use – September 21 2009<br>**<br>**Australian Political Delegation Visits Lincoln University<br>**<br>Six Australian politicians will tomorrow visit Lincoln University, New Zealand’s specialist land-based university, to learn about innovative approaches to the land-based sector.</p>
<p>The six have asked to see Lincoln University’s dairy farm and learn more about dairy industry advances being trialled there.</p>
<p>They will also hold discussions on topics including international trade and enhancing bio-diversity in agriculture for sustainability and profit.</p>
<p>Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Roger Field says the politicians recognise the university’s role in continuing innovation in the land-based sector.</p>
<p>“Land underpins some of this country’s biggest opportunities and greatest challenges and we are <em>the</em> institution which specialises in educating graduates who travel the country and the world, committed to transforming land, people and economies.</p>
<p>“We are effectively developing the leaders of tomorrow for specialist roles that haven’t even been thought of yet. What we do know is that these careers will see our graduates working at the forefront of economies all over the world.</p>
<p>“What might once have been a line between rural and urban is now well and truly blurred. Our graduates are recognised globally for landing on their feet and producing real results that count in the real world,” he says.</p>
