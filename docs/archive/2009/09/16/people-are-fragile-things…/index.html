<p><strong>People are fragile things…</strong></p>
<p>If true love is a perfect union, an inseparable bond, how do people cope when a relationship falls apart? Or self-destructs in the palm of their hand?</p>
<p>The season of <em>Peopleare<strong>fragilethings</strong>youshouldknowbynowbecarefulwhatyouputthemthrough</em> explores the dying sparks of collapsing relationships, each offering a different take on how people sift through the ashes left behind by the bright light of burnt love, and try to keep it burning.</p>
<p>The season is composed of three 30 minutes plays, <em>Ashes to Ashes</em>, <em>Three More Sleepless Nights</em>, and <em>Savage/Love</em>, all with the common theme of love and relationships.</p>
<p>The plays feature the acting talents of Chapman Tripp winners Eli Kent (Outstanding New Playwright 2008) and Erin Banks (Most Promising Female Newcomer 2005) among other local talent.</p>
<p>The season opens with <em>Ashes to Ashes,</em> written by the late Nobel Prize winner Harold Pinter.</p>
<p>“It’s a play about love, war and the cruelties we commit without thinking. It is steeped in dream logic, awkward silences and more dark humour than is usually good for you,” says director Uther Dean.</p>
<p><em>Three More Sleepless Nights</em>, written by Caryl Churchill, explores the bedroom diplomacy of relationships, focusing on three couples.</p>
<p>“It examines four people and their relationships through their different styles of arguing. How can we make someone happy and is it possible to change how we live and love?” says director Hannah Banks.</p>
<p><em>The evening is rounded off by Savage/Love, a play by Sam Shepard and Joseph Chaikin.</em></p>
<p><em>“The</em> play explores the performative nature of relationships and the fragmentary nature of memory following a journey through love moment to moment. It is a personal quest, but one that at times manages to transcend the individual and approach the universal,” says director Paul Waggott.</p>
<p><em><strong>fragilethings</strong></em> is Season 3 of the Theatre 304 Directing course run by Victoria University’s Theatre Programme. Twelve students work over the course of a trimester to produce twelve 30 minute plays, as the culmination of their BAs in Theatre. The students aim to produce work of a professional level, representing part of the next generation of New Zealand theatre.</p>
