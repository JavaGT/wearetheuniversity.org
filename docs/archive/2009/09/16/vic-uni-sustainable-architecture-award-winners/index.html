<p>Winners of Victoria University&#39;s sustainable architecture awards</p>
<p>‘Closing the Loops’, an exhibition of work from Sustainable Architecture students from Victoria University - the Winners are:</p>
<p><strong>$250 WasteMINZ Best project</strong><br><strong>Amelia Diggle for her light emitting water filter</strong><br>Amelia is a second year industrial design student and created a simple water filter that is lightweight and portable and designed for application in developing countries. It incorporates a system of electrolysis cells or water powered batteries that power an LED. This means the filter can be used at night in interiors without electrical lighting or can be used as a torch. The filter is made of two jars, one that is filled with dirty water and one that is left empty. They both screw onto a container that is filled with recycled cleaned and crushed fluorescent lamp glass and 6 small water cells that power one LED. The water cells are made of recycled circuit board metals. When the metals are submerged in water they under-go a reduction and oxidation processes that create a weak current that power an LED. The recycled glass sand acts as an insulator for the different metals as well as being a sufficient water filter. So while targeting a waste issue, the filter addresses health and social issues also.</p>
<p><strong>$250 WasteMINZ Best project</strong><br><strong>Duncan Harding for his mercury remediation from fluorescent tubes system</strong><br>Duncan is a second year architecture student. He designed a collection point for used fluorescent tubes which also serves to remediate the mercury content from them before they are recycled. The system uses the process of phytomining, which is the ability of plants to absorb heavy metals from their surroundings. Used tubes are planted upright into soil containing plants that take mercury up into their structure. The mercury can then be mined later from the plants. The collection point also makes use of the excess phosphors left in the tubes. By shining a single source of UV light onto them the tubes glow providing ambient low level light suitable for circulation lighting within offices or security lighting.</p>

<p><strong>$500 Winstone Wallboards Best plasterboard project</strong><br><strong>Libby Elmore for her vacuum insulation panels</strong><br>Libby is also a second year architecture student. She created a new insulation product using excess building materials from construction sites by taking research into vacuum insulation panels (VIP’s) into account. The core of the panels is made from waste crushed gib board along with chipped timber off-cuts and polystyrene. R values are in the range of 30 to 50, so heating energy demand is greatly reduced, health benefits accrue and construction waste is reduced to landfill while being reutilised within the construction industry.</p>
<p><strong>$500 Porirua City Council Project with the most potential for waste minimisation</strong><br><strong>Matthew King for ‘Interactive Wall’</strong><br>Matthew is a third year building science student. He designed an interior office partition wall system. The wall panels are constructed from saw dust and wood shavings and tyre shavings. The wood shavings and saw dust make up the exterior layer and the tyre is a sound insulation barrier. The three layers of the wall panels are held together by a natural resign called hyde glue. The frame of the wall system is constructed out of re-used timber in the form of modular elements. The wall frame contains no nails or screws. The wall system has been designed to be interactive, providing a chance for employees to personalise their surroundings. The wall intends to increase creativity within the work place which may have some benefit in terms of increased productivity, while utilising several waste sources and minimising sound disturbance in office situations.</p>
<p><strong>BENSON-COOPER</strong><br><strong>Design for Sustainability Award 2009</strong></p>
<p><strong>Supreme Award - $3000</strong><br>Final year Architecture group: <strong>Anna Farrow, Ben Jagersma, Eli Nuttall, Nick Officer</strong><br>For: “Lifestyle – Design Proposal Solar Decathlon”<br>Judges Comments<br>Re-invigorating the “Bach”, this clever and beautiful design is underpinned by extensive research into solar technologies that are integrated to achieve an autonomous and sustainable way of living. There is huge potential for adaptation for suburban and rural applications.</p>
<p><strong>Excellence Awards - three at $1000</strong><br>Master of Architecture: <strong>Soo Ryi</strong><br>For: “Guidelines for making VUW Faculty of Architecture &amp; Design carbon neutral through minimising its reliance on carbon offsets”<br>Thorough research that quantifies the contributing elements of the Faculty’s carbon footprint with practical and achievable recommendations to reduce emissions. A valuable contribution to the Faculty’s commitment to a sustainable future.</p>
<p>Master of Architecture: <strong>Nazia Kachwalla</strong> (Interior Architect)<br>For: “The Museum of Ephemera”<br>The integrity of the existing building is maintained and further sustainable proposals provides for an imaginative design. High technical and creative resolution coupled with professional presentation ensures a convincing outcome.</p>
<p>Second year Architecture group: <strong>Nicholas Brown, Cameron Hurrel, Clayton Prest, Henry Velvin</strong><br>For: “Changing Dystopia – The Green Community”<br>An ambitious proposal to re-generate derelict harbour-side land. This is a serious engagement by early-year students to comprehend and find resolutions for a complex situation, with transferable ideas for other places.</p>
<p><strong>Merit Awards – six at $100</strong><br>Final year Landscape Architecture: <strong>Hanna O’Donoghue</strong><br>For: “Filtered Landscapes”<br>This proposal captures much of Otaki’s waste re-cycling in a zone called the “hub” and transfers nutrients back to the land. A practical solution for small communities.</p>
<p>First year landscape Architecture: <strong>James Patullo</strong><br>For: “A Dunny and performance Space on the Waterfront”<br>“Out-of-box” thinking to use under-wharf spaces to locate pontoons for re-cycling waste. Visual engagement by passers-by ensures education about waste.</p>
<p>Final year Architecture: <strong>Anna Farrow</strong><br>For: “The Simple Life – A Batch for the 21st Century”<br>This work provides a new dimension to research on the ‘Bach’, one that embraces questions of sustainability.</p>
<p>Final year Architecture: <strong>Nick Officer</strong><br>For: “Organic Solar”<br>Emerging research into organic-photovoltaic is evaluated and transferred into potentially feasible ideas to power an autonomous house.</p>
<p>Final year Architecture: <strong>Eli Nuttall</strong><br>For: “PCM Passive Heating and Cooling”<br>Phase-change materials are incorporated to provide better quality of comfort and health for lower income family homes.</p>
<p>Final year Architecture: <strong>Ben Jagersma</strong><br>For: “Smart Homes – An Environmental Perspective”<br>‘Smart-home’ automated management systems are explored to ensure optimum performance of the autonomous house.</p>
<p><strong>Dean’s Merit Awards – two at $100</strong><br>First year Architecture: <strong>Grace Mills</strong><br>For: “Retreat for an Astronomer and Geologis”<br>A poetic response to the brief for a retreat house which incorporates passive energy design solutions.</p>
<p>Second year Architecture: <strong>Erica Brouard</strong><br>For: “Re-Wall”<br>An interior wall product “Re-wall” is made from stud framing off-cuts to produce an attractive solution that up-cycles potential waste.</p>
