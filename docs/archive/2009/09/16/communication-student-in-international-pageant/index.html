<p>Communication student in international pageant</p>

<p>First-year Bachelor of Communication student Catherine Irving is off to the Philippines next month to represent New Zealand in the Miss Earth World beauty pageant.</p>
<p>Miss Irving, 19, from Waverley, won the Miss Earth New Zealand title in Auckland this month after being named Miss Earth Wanganui in February.</p>
<p>She is the second Bachelor of Communication student to win the national title. Last year Rachel Crofts won while in her first year at Massey&#39;s Manawatu campus.</p>
<p>Miss Irving grew up in Waverley, the youngest of seven children. She is Maori (Nga Puhi) on her father&#39;s side while her mother&#39;s father is Spanish.</p>
<p>A keen dancer for the past six years, she is part of a New Zealand salsa dance troupe that has performed in the United States, China and Australia.</p>
<p>She says the Miss Earth beauty pageant is like other contests, with swimwear, eveningwear, speeches and &quot;random questions&quot; to answer, but also has an environmental aspect. &quot;I like it because it&#39;s not just about looks and it actually gives you a purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>That &quot;purpose&quot; is to create environmental awareness in New Zealand. Although the main prize for winning the contest is the trip to Manila, the local organisers will also support her awareness-raising efforts when she returns.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve got some projects in mind. I would like to work with kids in schools, because that&#39;s where it starts. I could do something like use my dancing, perhaps with costumes made from recycled materials.&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Irving says beauty pageants were not something she ever considered and, when approached by the organisers, initially declined. &quot;Then I thought it would be good stage time and good for my future public relations career, and it has been a really good experience.</p>
<p>&quot;My course is really good. I love it. It makes it easy to study because I enjoy it so much. Next year I want to major in PR.&quot;</p>
<p>She likes the buzz of the campus, enjoys living in the halls of residence and regrets only that she has not been able to throw herself more into student social life because of her other commitments to dancing, to family and now to Miss Earth New Zealand. &quot;It&#39;s been quite full-on at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Most weekends she drives to Waverley or performs with her salsa and hip hop dance troupe throughout New Zealand. On top of that she is also doing silver medal-stage Latin and ballroom dancing.</p>
