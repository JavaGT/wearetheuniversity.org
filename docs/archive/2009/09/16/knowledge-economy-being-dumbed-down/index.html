<p>Knowledge economy being dumbed down</p>
<p>Dr Don Brash and his productivity taskforce need to urgently advise the Education Minister that we will never catch up with Australia in wages and quality of life by treating those teaching at polytechnics with contempt, Green Party Co-Leader Metiria Turei said today.</p>
<p>Polytechnic staff have been told, by their employers, they must increase teaching days for academic staff from 185 days per year to 204.</p>
<p>“It is deeply insulting to people already under pressure from massively increased polytechnic rolls to now be told by their employers that they must work harder for less,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
<p>Staff at the polytechnics affected by industrial action have been offered a one percent salary increase with no back dating and a 24 month term from the date of signing.</p>
<p>“Offering a pay rise of one percent for two years will effectively see academic staff’s wages drop well below the rate of inflation,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
<p>“While the Government talks about New Zealand wages needing to catch up with Australia –decisions like this will see us falling further and further behind.</p>
<p>“The teachers and tutors at New Zealand’s polytechnics are training our next generation of workers. These are the very people we should be investing more money in – not grinding down.</p>
<p>“New Zealand needs to work smarter, not longer and dumber,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
