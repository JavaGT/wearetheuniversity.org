<p>MEDIA RELEASE<br>25 September 2009</p>
<p>Making a difference through physics</p>
<p>In his inaugural professorial lecture next Tuesday, a Victoria professor will outline how he navigated the world of science before finding an area where he could make a difference.</p>
<p>Argentinian-born physicist Professor Etchegoin is developing a way to detect single molecules, the ‘entities’ that make up most things around us.</p>
<p>“We’re working towards being able to pick up a speck and confirm whether it is, for example, dust or cocaine. So our research has implications for the detection of illegal drugs and forensic science in general.</p>
<p>“It could also help identify diseases earlier because by the time you see morphological changes in cells through microscopes, it may be too late. The tool we are developing could help by showing changes on the molecular level earlier.</p>
<p>“The technique is still a bit ‘too sensitive’ and sometimes difficult to control but we’re getting there; we hope to make it a standard tool.”</p>
<p>Professor Etchegoin notes that in many respects the study of science is unpredictable. Since doing a PhD in physics 20 years ago, he has studied a range of topics from semiconductors to areas of chemistry, and even some biology before finding his niche.</p>
<p>“As a scientist, your research adapts over the years as you change roles and focus. A university you move to may concentrate on different areas of research; lab availability can also influence the work you undertake.</p>
<p>“If you told me 20 years ago that I would be doing the research I am at Victoria, I wouldn’t have believed it at all.”</p>

<p>Victoria University Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Research, Professor Neil Quigley, says Professor Etchegoin has established an impressive reputation as a physicist working on world-leading research.</p>
<p>“Since arriving at Victoria five years ago, Professor Etchegoin has contributed immensely to the first-class research our scholars are doing in the area of physics. His research has the potential to become a standard scientific tool with benefits for wider society.”</p>
<p>Professor Quigley says Victoria’s Inaugural Lecture series is an opportunity for new professors to provide family, friends, colleagues and the wider community with an insight into their specialist area of study.</p>
<p>“It is also an opportunity for the University to celebrate and acknowledge our valued professors.”</p>
<p>Professor Etchegoin has worked as a Fellow of the National Commission for Atomic Energy of Argentina, studied at the Max-Planck Institute in Stuttgart, and later in Cambridge University as a Marie-Curie Fellow of the European Union and been awarded the T. K. Sidey Medal from the Royal Society of New Zealand for his work in electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p>The public lecture is at 6pm in the Hunter Council Chamber, Level 2, Hunter Building, Gate 1 or 2, Kelburn Parade on Tuesday 29 September. To RSVP, email <a href="mailto:rsvp@vuw.ac.nz">rsvp@vuw.ac.nz</a> with ‘Etchegoin’ in the subject line.</p>
