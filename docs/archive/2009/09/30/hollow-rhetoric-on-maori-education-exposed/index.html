<p>30 September 2009 <strong>Media Statement</strong><br>**<br>Tolley’s hollow rhetoric on Maori education exposed**</p>
<p>Education Minister Anne Tolley’s apparent concerns about the sector’s under-performance for Maori students ring hollow in light of National’s attempts to block a Maori Affairs select committee inquiry into the matter, says Labour MP Kelvin Davis.</p>
<p>“Anne Tolley’s speeches to NZEI yesterday and the PPTA today have both highlighted the need for the education sector to lift its game when it comes to improving outcomes for Maori and Pasifika students.</p>
<p>“She claims the system needs to work smarter and better. I wholeheartedly agree, but I find her comments remarkable in light of National’s decision last week to try to block the Maori Affairs select committee from holding an inquiry into Maori educational under-achievement how the system can actually work better to improve it.</p>
<p>“The final vote on the inquiry will be made at the next Maori Affairs select committee. This was decided after Labour MPs agreed to give the Maori Party time to decide if they would back it,” Kelvin Davis says.</p>
<p>“There was immense pressure applied by National MPs on the Maori Party to fall into line and vote against this inquiry, which was also deeply disappointing.</p>
<p>“It is outrageous that the Minister blocks a cross party inquiry into raising achievement and then less than a week later preaches to teachers’ unions about the need to work together.</p>

<p>“The Minister should take her own advice and instruct the National MPs to work with Labour and the Maori Party to vote in support of the inquiry into Maori educational underachievement,” Kelvin Davis says.</p>
<p>“I’m also concerned about the potential impact on Maori students of the draft Tertiary Education Strategy released by Anne Tolley yesterday.</p>
<p>“The document makes it clear the Government is preparing to allow tertiary institutions more flexibility to raise student fees and is signalling less financial support for older students returning to study.</p>
<p>“I can’t see how higher student fees will help lower income people, particularly Maori, participate in tertiary education,” Kelvin Davis said.</p>
