<p>Christchurch residents open to Conservatorium proposal</p>
<p>Research commissioned by the University of Canterbury has found that a majority of Christchurch residents are open to the idea of a National Conservatorium of Music being established at the Christchurch Arts Centre.</p>
<p>The research by ACNielsen asked residents their opinion on the proposed location of the Conservatorium building. It also sought their views on the Christchurch City Council constructing the building and recovering all costs, including interest, through lease payments by the University.</p>
<p>Of those surveyed, 37 percent supported the proposal overall and 23 percent neither supported nor opposed the overall proposal - meaning 60 percent of those surveyed were open to the proposal. A further six percent did not know and 34 percent were against the proposal.</p>
<p>The research found that residents over the age of 65 were three times more likely to oppose the proposed funding model and the Conservatorium’s proposed location than those aged 15 to 24.</p>
<p>In relation to the Christchurch City Council funding the building and recovering all costs - including interest - through lease payments from the University, 21 percent of those surveyed were supportive and 17 percent were opposed. A large proportion (36 percent) said they neither supported nor opposed the funding proposal. The remainder did not know.  </p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr believes the results reflect a broader range of views than what is currently being aired publicly and says they will be heartening for UC&#39;s Music students and staff.</p>

<p>&quot;I have said all along, in relation to the Arts Centre proposal, that the University will not go where it is not wanted. These research findings tell us that the majority of Christchurch residents are open to the idea, and we now look forward to the next waypoint in this process in October when the Christchurch City Council is expected to reach a decision.”  </p>
<p>The University has today released a new image of the proposed building (attached) which reflects the Hereford Street profile and incorporates refinements resulting from consultation with the Historic Places Trust - which has publicly expressed its support – the Christchurch City Council’s Urban Design panel and the Arts Centre Trust Board.</p>
