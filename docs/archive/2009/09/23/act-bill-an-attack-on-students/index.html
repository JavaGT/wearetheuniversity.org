<p>Media Statement<br>23 September 2009</p>
<p>Act Bill an attack on students</p>
<p>“This Bill is a direct attack on the welfare of students,” says CTU President Helen Kelly.</p>
<p>The Education (Freedom of Association) Bill introduced by Roger Douglas today in Parliament would make student associations voluntary</p>
<p>“This Bill comes at a time when the Government wants to improve the learning environment for students. Yet this Bill would do the exact opposite and guarantee the loss of essential student support services” said Kelly.</p>
<p>“Student associations provide critical services such as student loan advice, welfare support, advocacy services, sporting and cultural clubs and facilities that are all essential for student welfare. The loss of these services would be incalculable.</p>
<p>Student associations also play an essential role in providing an organised and collective voice. They represent students on numerous education councils and committees on campuses throughout New Zealand and their contribution is highly valued.</p>
<p>Students already have the choice of whether they want voluntary or compulsory student associations. That vote took place in 1999 and the vast majority of student campuses voted for universal membership. And of the three students association that voted for voluntary membership, two have voted to go back to compulsory membership”.</p>
<p>“This is a completely unnecessary Bill, is a waste of Parliament time. It would be a tragedy to see student associations and student welfare threatened by the antics of the Act Party” stated Kelly.</p>
