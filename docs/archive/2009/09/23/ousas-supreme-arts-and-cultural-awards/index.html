<p>OUSA’s Supreme Arts and Cultural Awards</p>
<p>The Golds, Otago University Students Association (OUSA)’s supreme arts and cultural awards ceremony takes place this Thursday.</p>
<p>The Otago University Students Association Golds Awards recognise the achievement of students who have excelled in the arts or cultural fields throughout the year.</p>
<p>Keynote speaker Alex Lee is travelling from Auckland to be at the ceremony. Alex is co-founder of Documentary New Zealand, founder of the Asia Film Festival Aotearoa, he runs a film company and a casting agency and is a lawyer specialising in entertainment, commercial, and immigration law.</p>
<p>Alex was also the first Asian president of the (then) New Zealand University Students’ Association in 1986 and is an OUSA Life Member.</p>
<p>The most prestigious awards categories are the Golds, Outstanding Contribution to Arts and Culture and the Club of the Year. Cultural clubs have been working hard all year through events and other activities to build up the ‘mana’ to be awarded Club of the Year.</p>
<p>“The Golds nominations this year reflect a solid range of artistic cultural achievements by Otago students” says OUSA Clubs Representative Dan Stride, who hopes the recognition will spur others to reach similar, or even greater, heights in future years.</p>
<p>The evening begins at 6:30pm in the Atrium of the Otago Museum. Tickets for anyone wishing to attend are $60.</p>
