<p>Doors to learning at Albany campus Open Day</p>
<p>Budding broadcasters can test for photogenic faces and crisp enunciation before a rolling camera as they read from an autocue in a mock newsroom at Open Day at Massey’s Albany campus this Saturday.</p>
<p>It is one of dozens of interactive events aimed at giving prospective students a hands-on experience related to a study programme of interest.</p>
<p>For aspiring media and communications students who would prefer to be behind the camera, there is the Report on Open Day competition organised by the School of Cultural and Social Studies, with three $1000 university bursary prizes for the best three entries. These can be in the form of a written or photo essay, or a mini documentary.</p>
<p>The school’s English Studies department is also running a Haiku poetry competition. Scribes must pen three Haiku on their Open Day experience for a chance to win an iPod touch. The judge is senior lecturer, poet and editor Dr Jack Ross.</p>
<p>Those interested in a degree in construction – which embraces property and project management, quantity surveying, insurance, law and management – can don hard hats, covered boots and vests to join a construction tour of the new library to glimpse the realities of working on a new project. The five-floor library extension building is due to open in November.</p>
<p>Witness the future of our supermarket shelves as high school student teams are judged for new food products they have been developing through a joint scheme with Massey’s Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health, the New Zealand Institute of Food Science and Technology, Futureintech and the Royal Society of New Zealand’s CREST (Creativity in Science and Technology) awards scheme.</p>

<p>Prospective business students can try their hand at the New Zealand Investment Game, created by investment advisor and former College of Business lecturer Frank Newman, which aims to raise the financial IQ of players and teach investment strategies based on real-time market indicators.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in psychology can test their truth-telling tendencies on the lie detector machine, while budding jazz musicians can pre-register for free workshops with top jazz tutors such as legendary drummer Frank Gibson for voice, piano, bass, jazz flute, drums and guitar which will run throughout the day.</p>
<p>Guest lectures by historian Associate Professor Peter Lineham and mathematician Distinguished Professor Gaven Martin give visitors the chance to hear great minds communicating their knowledge.</p>
<p>Food stalls, live rock and jazz and Pasifika cultural performances will bring a festive buzz to the day, and informative seminars; such as navigating university jargon, and a question and answer panel by extramural and mature students, will ensure students from all walks of life will come away with new insights into university life and information about courses they want to pursue.</p>
