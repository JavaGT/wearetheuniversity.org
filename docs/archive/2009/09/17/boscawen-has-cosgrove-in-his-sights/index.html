<p>Boscawen Has Cosgrove In His Sights</p>
<p>John Boscawen MP, ACT New Zealand</p>
<p>Thursday, September 17 2009</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand MP John Boscawen today demanded to know how Labour&#39;s Clayton Cosgrove could claim to be an adequate electorate MP for the people of Waimakariri when, in relation to the Anti-Smacking referendum, he has completely ignored his constituents&#39; overwhelming call for the law to be changed.</p>
<p>&quot;Waimakiriri generated 27,071 &#39;No&#39; votes in the Anti-Smacking Referendum – the most out of all Labour seats.  That&#39;s far more than the 16,360 people who voted Mr Cosgrove in as their local MP,&quot; Mr Boscawen said.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s 16,360 people who are probably feeling pretty ripped off right now.  After all, New Zealanders expect their electorate MPs to be their voice in Parliament – what the people of Waimakariri got was an MP who tries to run their lives and tell them what to do.</p>
<p>&quot;This is no longer solely about the smacking referendum results but, rather, the bigger issue of democracy – something Mr Cosgrove clearly doesn&#39;t understand, otherwise he would be listening to his constituents and supporting a change to the law.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time for Mr Cosgrove to front up.  Next week I will be holding a public meeting on the results of the Anti-Smacking Referendum – the second of a series to be held throughout the country and designed to maintain pressure on politicians about this issue.</p>
<p>&quot;This meeting will be held in Mr Cosgrove&#39;s Waimakiriri electorate and I challenge him to come along and face his constituents, to explain why he knows better than them how they should live their lives and raise their children,&quot; Mr Boscawen said.</p>
<p>Public Meeting On The Anti-Smacking Referendum, Monday, September 21 2009, 7.30pm, St Bedes College, 210 Main North Road, Papanui, Christchurch</p>
