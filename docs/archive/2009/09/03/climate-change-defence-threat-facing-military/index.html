<p>Climate change defence threat facing world&#39;s military</p>
<p>A defence conference at the Manawatu campus today was told that armies throughout the word face rapidly emerging new challenges from the weather due to climate change.</p>
<p>Pandemics, food and water shortages, natural disasters and displaced populations all pose strategic challenges for defence forces, according to speakers at the biennial conference hosted by the University&#39;s Centre for Defence Studies.</p>
<p>Among them was Professor Peter Leahy from the University of Canberra, a former Australian Defence Force Chief of Army. “I don’t think we’ve done enough to prepare for the future threat of climate change,&quot; Professor Leahy said. &quot;The old certainties are gone and the emerging world is more volatile...dynamic and unpredictable.”</p>
<p>He urged the New Zealand military to make the implications represented by climate change a priority in future planning.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s Climate Change Ambassador Dr Adrian Macey also spoke, describing the atmospheric warming arising from burning too many fossil fuels as a “threat multiplier” with disease, hunger water wars and the displacement of people as possible “worst case” outcomes.</p>
<p>“Climate change is a real challenge in the strategic analysis and I think New Zealand has to front up more than what I’ve seen,” he told more that 220 assembled army personnel.</p>
<p>New Zealand Chief of Army, Major General Rhys Jones acknowledged that environmental challenges where just one example of changes “unparalleled to what we had before.” A tough economic climate actually provided the Army with the opportunity to change as it adapted its personnel’s operational and technical skills to particular situations as they arose, he said</p>
<p>Centre for Defence Studies director Professor Glyn Harper said the conference reinforced the close relationship the New Zealand Army had with Massey. “It’s a significant event on our calendar for the year. It expresses the relationship between Massey as a learning organisation and the Army which has to be a learning organisation to face its multitude of challenges.”</p>
