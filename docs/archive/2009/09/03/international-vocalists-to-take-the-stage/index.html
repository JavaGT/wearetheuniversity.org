<p><strong>Thursday, 3 September 2009, 2:56 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>International vocalists to take the stage</p>
<p>International singers Nicholas Isherwood and Christian Wolz will bring their world-renowned vocal talents to the stage as part of the New Zealand School of Music (NZSM) 2009 concert series.</p>
<p>The pair will take the stage on Friday September 11 at 7pm at the NZSM’s Adam Concert Room, at Victoria University’s Kelburn Campus.</p>
<p>NZSM Programme Leader of Composition Michael Norris says the performance is one of the highlights of the year for the NZSM, a centre of musical excellence run jointly by Victoria and Massey Universities.</p>
<p>“To have performers of such an international reputation as Isherwood and Wolz is fantastic for the school,” he says.</p>
<p>“They bring with them a wealth of experience in contemporary forms of vocalisation, from operatic singing to Tuvan throatsinging and everything in between. This is a must-hear event.”</p>
<p>US-born Nicholas Isherwood is one of the leading singers of early and contemporary music in the world. He has collaborated with performers and composers throughout the world including the legendary German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen. His output includes 48 CDs, three film appearances, and a book called The Techniques of Singing.</p>
<p>His Wellington performance will be one of Stockhausen’s last pieces, Havona, which was written for bass voice and electronics. The performance will be followed by a question and answer session on the work and Isherwood’s 24 year collaboration with Stockhausen.</p>
<p>Christian Wolz is a vocal artist, composer and a physiotherapist who combines new styles of singing and language with the musical structures of medieval and non-European cultures. He uses things such as microphones and effect processors as unique musical instruments, and combines both composition and improvisation in his performances.</p>

<p>“The result is a large sphere of association where communication is developed as a deep, emotional and pristine form of conveyance,” says Mr Norris.</p>
<p>Since 1988 Wolz has created numerous concerts, vocal performances, sound installations, radio plays, CDs and multimedia-performances. He has performed all over the world, but this will be the German’s first visit to New Zealand.</p>
<p>As well as the concert, the two artists will share a public workshop for composers on Monday, September 7, 2.10 pm at the Adam Concert Room, and Isherwood will give a public masterclass for NZSM voice students on Friday September 11, 1.30pm at the same venue.</p>
<p>The two singers will also appear with local chamber ensemble Stroma in a concert on Thursday September 10, 8pm, Ilott Concert Chamber. Stroma comprises many performers from the NZSO who are also artist teachers at the NZSM.</p>
