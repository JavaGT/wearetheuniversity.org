<p>Bellamy talking about NZ conservation at Massey</p>
<p>British botanist and environmental campaigner Professor David Bellamy will give a public talk on New Zealand conservation in at the Albany campus next Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Professor Bellamy, famous for his impassioned insights into the wonders and fragilities of nature in documentaries such as the filmed-in-New Zealand Moa’s Ark – will also meet with postgraduate students in the Massey’s Institute of Natural Sciences Ecology and Conservation Group.</p>
<p>Group head Associate Professor Dianne Brunton says the meeting will provide an opportunity to discuss some of the projects her colleagues and the students are working on, such as kakapo and kakariki research.</p>
<p>“For our students, who come from all over the world, David Bellamy is an inspirational figure,” Dr Brunton says. “We’re thrilled he is taking the time to come and talk to us and to hear about some of our conservation research projects.&quot;</p>
<p>He will also visit the Three Streams conservation project at Albany, as well as Long Bay and Shakespear Regional parks next week.</p>
<p>Professor Bellamy, who trained as a botanist at Durham University, England, has written and presented more than 400 television programmes, 80 scientific papers and many books on botany, ecology and environmental issues.</p>
<p>Professor Bellamy used the ark metaphor to present New Zealand’s natural past with its ancient “dinosaur forests”, unusual birds and living fossils such as tuatara, giant kauri snails and mute frogs.</p>
<p>This week Professor Bellamy is returning to Whirinaki Forest Park in Bay of Plenty where he filmed the “Moa’s Ark” documentary in 1990.</p>
<p>Professor David Bellamy public lecture: Wednesday, September 9, 7.30pm, Sir Neil Waters Lecture Theatre Building (NW300), Massey University, Albany, Gate 1, Albany Expressway, SH17.</p>
