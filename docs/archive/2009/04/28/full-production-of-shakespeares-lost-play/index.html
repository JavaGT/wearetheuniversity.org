<p><strong>Tuesday, 28 April 2009, 11:00 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>First full production of Shakespeare’s lost play to take place in Wellington.</strong></p>
<p>Think again if you thought world premieres of William Shakespeare plays were a thing of the past.</p>
<p>In May 2009 the lost tragicomedy <em>The History of Cardenio,</em> by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, reconstructed by world renowned Shakespeare scholar Professor Gary Taylor, will be presented by third year Theatre students at Victoria University of Wellington.</p>
<p>Based on Lewis Theobald’s <em>Double Falsehood,</em> an 18th century adaptation of Shakespeare and Fletcher’s now-lost original, Professor Taylor’s work takes us closer than ever before to this little-known play.</p>
<p>“How often do you get to see what one genius (Shakespeare) does with the work of another genius (Cervantes)?” says Professor Taylor. “There’s a reason we talk about live theatre, because it’s only in a full-scale performance like this that Shakespeare’s text really comes alive again.”</p>
<p>Live the experience of a 17th century theatre-goer without traveling through time! Professor David Carnegie’s production reconstructs the staging of a renaissance performance; Studio 77 has been transformed into a Jacobean private playhouse.</p>
<p>Professor Carnegie, the play’s director, says: “Plays by Shakespeare and his contemporaries come alive with a special magic when the audience is on all four sides, as at the Globe or Blackfriars, and when the actors acknowledge the presence of the audience”.</p>
<p>A tale of hearts broken and mended, friendships betrayed and rebuilt, sanity lost and found, dukes, shepherds and Don Quixote, joy and misery, laughter and tears, <em>The History of Cardenio</em> will take you on a wild ride through the whole gamut of human emotions.</p>
