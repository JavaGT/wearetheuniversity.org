<p>Sir Paul to present top award – The AUT Business School Award ceremony</p>
<p>Tonight, AUT University Chancellor Sir Paul Reeves will present AUT’s highest undergraduate business award to one of the university’s most outstanding students.</p>
<p>Bachelor of Business graduate Xavier Black will collect three awards at this evening’s AUT Business School Award ceremony, being held at the Auckland War Memorial Museum.</p>
<p>She will be taking home the ANZ Award for top graduating student in SIFE (Students in Free Enterprise); the 360 Marketing Award for the top Maori graduate in the Bachelor of Business; and the Consortium Award for top overall graduate in the Bachelor of Business.</p>
<p>Dean of the Faculty of Business and Law Professor Des Graydon says Black is one of the school’s highest achieving students ever.</p>
<p>“We have more than 6,000 students enrolled in business at AUT and standing out at this level requires commitment, grit and determination,” he says.</p>
<p>“Xavier has consistently achieved an A average across all her papers throughout her degree, where she majored in marketing. She represents the best of the best and it’s an honour to have her at our Business School.”</p>
<p>Black is currently completing her Master of Business degree studying management, marketing and sustainability, specialising in corporate social responsibility.</p>
<p>She says AUT’s unique face-to-face teaching style is pivotal to her learning success.</p>
<p>“The small classrooms and personal interaction with lecturers has enabled me to learn from their experiences,” she says.</p>

<p>“Our best and brightest business students are being honoured tonight for their excellence in endeavour, learning and academic success,” he says. “These are the people who will be instrumental in shaping New Zealand’s future.”</p>
