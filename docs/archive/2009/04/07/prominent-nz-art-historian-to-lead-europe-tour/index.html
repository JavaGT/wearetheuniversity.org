<p>Prominent NZ art historian to lead Europe tour</p>
<p>A unique opportunity to see some of the world’s best contemporary art with one of New Zealand’s leading art historians/curators is being offered to Kiwi art lovers later this year.</p>
<p>Victoria University Senior Lecturer in Art History and Director of the University’s Adam Art Gallery, Tina Barton, will lead a month-long tour to major contemporary art events in five European cities in September/October 2009.</p>
<p>Entitled ‘Old World/New Art’, the study tour provides an opportunity to visit contemporary art museums and galleries in Frankfurt, Istanbul, Athens, Venice and London.</p>
<p>“This tour is an opportunity to see some of the best contemporary art the world has to offer,” says Tina.</p>
<p>“It aims to provide up-to-date insights into what is currently galvanising the art world, as well as giving participants the opportunity to visit some of the ancient treasures and sights of these extraordinary cities.”</p>
<p>The month-long tour will visit three biennales and one art fair, large-scale events that Tina says provide a unique insight into the contemporary art scene.</p>
<p>“Biennales and art fairs have recently emerged as key forums for contemporary art. Having these events in ancient cities like Athens and Venice provides a fascinating intersection of old and new, which is a major theme of the tour. Although the juxtaposition will, at times, be stark, it will help us to understand how contemporary art operates in the world today, at the same time as it draws on the past for its meaning.”</p>

<p>The tour begins in Frankfurt, Germany’s key transportation hub and home to more than 20 museums where the itinerary will include several cutting-edge contemporary galleries and art museums. It then progresses to the 11th Istanbul Biennale and then onto Athens, where one of the world’s newest biennales is this year entitled ‘Heaven’.</p>
<p>“From there we travel to the oldest biennale of them all, Venice, which will also include spending a day at the Arsenale, the cavernous old shipyards that have been turned into exhibition spaces which are the highlight of the Biennale,” says Tina.</p>
<p>The last stop is London where some of the attractions on offer include a visit to the world renowned Tate Modern, the Serpentine Gallery, the Saatchi Gallery and London’s largest and most prestigious art fair, the Frieze Art Fair which is held annually in Regent’s Park</p>
<p>A well-known commentator on contemporary art, Tina has attended every Venice Biennale since 1999 and is familiar with a variety of contemporary art contexts.</p>
<p>Her knowledge and experience means she will be able to provide insights into the nature of the work on show, as well as drawing out their meanings in relation to the wider frameworks in which they will be seen.   </p>
