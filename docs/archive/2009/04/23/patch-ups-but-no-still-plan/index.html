<p><strong>Thursday, 23 April 2009, 5:33 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Phil Goff<br>Leader of the Labour Party</p>
<p>23 April 2009 Media Statement</p>
<p>Patch-ups but no still plan</p>
<p>The Government’s latest patch-up of its nine-day working fortnight will do nothing to reassure the thousands of Kiwis worried about losing their jobs, Labour Leader Phil Goff says.</p>
<p>“Sixty percent of the workforce and more than 90 percent of businesses are still ineligible for the scheme,” Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>“The National Government’s lack of a plan for the economy means they are continuing to offer patch-ups and poorly thought-out offerings instead of providing real stimulus to the economy.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders need to see a Government in charge of the economy and providing leadership instead of one that sacks public servants without a second thought, says it’s too hard to help small businesses, but asks private businesses to keep workers on and ride out the recession.</p>
<p>“If the Government was truly committed to keeping New Zealanders in work it would extend the nine-day working fortnight to its own departments instead of sacking them.</p>
<p>“John Key’s explanation that small businesses are not included in the nine-day fortnight initiative because it would be too difficult to manage is a cop-out.</p>
<p>“Small businesses employ hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders and for the Government to wipe its hands of them because they think it’s too hard is ridiculous.</p>
<p>“The Government used the same excuse to justify not including a training component.</p>
<p>“New Zealand workers need to know their Government is committed to keeping Kiwis in work and to building a stronger economy.</p>
<p>“Complaining that it’s too hard to help small businesses or help people into training shows that this is not a Government ready to pull out all the stops to help ordinary Kiwis,” Phil Goff said.</p>
