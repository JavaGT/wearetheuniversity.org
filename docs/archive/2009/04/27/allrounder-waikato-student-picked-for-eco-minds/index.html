<p>Mixing it up for Eco-Minds</p>
<p>Management and science isn’t the most typical mix of subjects for a university degree, but for University of Waikato student Rebecca Williamson it’s opened the way to a place at a top youth forum on sustainable development.</p>
<p>Williamson is one of just five New Zealand students who’ve been selected to attend the Asia-Pacific Eco-Minds Sustainable Development Forum, sponsored by Bayer and the United Nationals Environment Programme (UNEP).</p>
<p>They’ll join around 15 students from eight other Asia-Pacific countries for a week of mini lectures, discussions and fact-finding trips on the development of sustainable energy systems, looking specifically at New Zealand as a case study.</p>
<p>The forum will be held in Auckland and Rotorua next month [May 25-29].</p>
<p>To win her place, Williamson had to submit a 1,000 word essay on the topic, but she says it’s a great opportunity to bring her twin interests together. “I’m doing a conjoint management and science degree at Waikato, and most people just look blank when I say I’m majoring in chemistry and economics,” she says. “The Eco-Minds forum is the first thing I’ve found where I can mix the two together, and I just thought – yess!”</p>
<p>The former Mt Maunganui College student did chemistry and calculus at school, and was a member of a winning team in the Young Enterprise Scheme. She was tossing up between a degree in science and a degree in management when she saw a flyer for the conjoint degree at Waikato.</p>

<p>“That decided me,” she says. “This degree gives me the chance to develop my skills in both science and management. This year I’ve already completed a summer research scholarship project in chemistry – that was on immobilising metal nanoparticles into fabric, and now I’ve got the opportunity to find out more about sustainable energy options at the Eco-Minds forum.”</p>
<p>Williamson says the week-long forum should be fun: “We’ll have specialists in sustainability as guest speakers, and there’s a competition where we have to come up with ideas for working together to reduce our carbon footprint across the Asia-Pacific region. It’s all about working globally to solve problems.”</p>
<p>Williamson is in her fourth year of the five-year conjoint degree, and says she’s interested in working in the area of environmental policy making when she graduates.</p>
