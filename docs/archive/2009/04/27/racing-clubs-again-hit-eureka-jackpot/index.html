<p><strong>Monday, 27 April 2009, 2:28 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Brendon Burns<br><strong>MP for Christchurch Central</strong></p>
<p>27 April 2009<br><strong>Media Statement</strong><br><strong>Racing clubs again hit Eureka jackpot</strong></p>
<p>Racing clubs are again the biggest beneficiaries of community grants pay outs by Christchurch-based Eureka Trust, causing local Labour MP Brendon Burns to say he’ll now lodge a complaint.</p>
<p>The Christchurch Central MP says South Island racing clubs have again hoovered up nearly 20 percent of the latest $1.3m distributed, most of it from Canterbury bars in the Robbies chain which use Eureka to channel pokie machine profits. *</p>
<p>Brendon Burns will lodge a complaint about Eureka Trust with the Department of Internal Affairs.</p>
<p>Brendon Burns says Pub Charity made only a handful of very small grants to racing clubs and the Southern Trust approved none, whereas Eureka Trust did not decline any racing club’s application.</p>
<p>“But it did say no to dozens of organisations helping those in need such as Community House, the Phillipstown Community Centre, Christchurch schools and sports clubs,” Brendon Burns said.</p>
<p>“Hitting the jackpot is the Oamaru Harness Racing Club which got $75,000. That’s despite Oamaru not having, according to the Eureka website, any bars in the district which contribute to the Eureka Trust’s funds.</p>
<p>“The Cheviot Harness and Racing Club, which again has no contributing bar or club listed, got $20,000. All up, racing clubs have taken more than a quarter of a million in allocated funds.</p>
<p>“Eureka Trust members, who are well-paid for their task, should explain why they continue to take money out of poorer communities in Christchurch and fund racing clubs, especially those in rural areas.</p>

<p>“There are about 1900 pokie machines in Christchurch generating around $90m in income – more than $250 for every man, woman and child. The pokies are concentrated in lower decile areas. Morally that money should come back to those communities.</p>
<p>“Instead, it’s being diverted into such activities as providing stake money for racing clubs. This is gambling supporting gambling – at the expense of those who most need the money back in their communities, especially in these tough times,” said Brendon Burns.</p>
<p><em>* By law, 37 percent of the gross proceeds of pokie machines must be distributed to charitable purposes.</em></p>
