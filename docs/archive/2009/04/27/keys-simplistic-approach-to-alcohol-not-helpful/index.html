<p>Iain Lees-Galloway</p>
<p>Labour Associate Health Spokesperson (Drugs and Alcohol)</p>
<p>27 April 2009 Media Statement<br>Key’s Simplistic Approach to Alcohol Not Helpful</p>
<p>John Key needs to understand that alcohol addiction and abuse issues are about much more than young people out on ‘benders’ says Labour Associate Health Spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway.</p>
<p>Iain Lees-Galloway was responding to Mr Key’s statement on Newstalk ZB this morning that &quot;I think you&#39;ve got to be very careful you don&#39;t get in a situation where you simply whack up the price of booze and everybody gets affected because some, particularly young people, are going out on benders.”</p>
<p>Iain Lees-Galloway said that if Mr Key had spent any time with people involved in drug and alcohol treatment he would realise that addiction and abuse issues are far more complex than how he portrays them.</p>
<p>“Often the issue of alcohol dependency is just the tip of the iceberg. Domestic violence, mental health issues, work absenteeism, and a plethora of other factors are intermingled with alcohol addiction. We need to give careful consideration to how we deal with both the supply of alcohol and the treatment of addiction and dependency,” said Iain Lees-Galloway.</p>
<p>“Those effects of alcohol addiction often take place behind closed doors but they are nevertheless a massive drain on our society and our economy.</p>
<p>“While it is important to maintain the freedoms enjoyed by the thousands of New Zealanders who drink alcohol responsibly, we also need to recognise the extent to which alcohol damages our communities and constrains economic growth.</p>
<p>“At a cost of over $5 billion each year, the harmful abuse of alcohol almost wipes out everything gained from the agricultural sector.”</p>
<p>“There are no simple answers to the damaging effects of alcohol and Mr Key’s attempt to offload all the responsibility onto young people has done nothing to assist in the search for solutions,” said Iain Lees-Galloway.</p>
