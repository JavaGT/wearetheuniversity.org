<p>CTU media release<br>2 April 2009</p>
<p>CTU appoints new economist</p>
<p>The CTU has appointed Bill Rosenberg as Economist and Director of Policy. He will commence work on 11th May.</p>
<p>Bill Rosenberg has a B.Com in Economics, a BSc in Mathematics and a PhD in Mathematical Psychology.</p>
<p>He is currently Deputy Director, University Centre for Teaching and Learning at the University of Canterbury, a Member of the Institute of Directors, a Commissioner on TEC, and was a member of the Regional Land Transport Committee of Environment Canterbury.</p>
<p>Bill Rosenberg is widely published on globalisation, trade and e-learning and has been an active trade unionist for 30 years including the Tramways Union and Association of University Staff where he was National President for several years.</p>
<p>Peter Conway, CTU Secretary and previously CTU Economist for 9 years said, “I am delighted that the CTU has attracted someone of the calibre of Bill Rosenberg. His analytical and research skills will be of huge value as unions grapple with the ongoing impact of the global financial crisis on workers as well as continuing to advocate on the need to create decent jobs, lift wages and productivity as well as maintain public services that underpin the social wage.”</p>
