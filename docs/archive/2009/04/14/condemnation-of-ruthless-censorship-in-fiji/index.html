<p>Condemnation of &quot;ruthless censorship&quot; in Fiji</p>
<p>AUCKLAND (PMC Online/Pacific Media Watch): The Pacific Media Centre, a<br>regional development communication research and publication resource,<br>has condemned the Fiji regime&#39;s &#39;ruthless censorship&#39; of news<br>organisations and called for an end to intimidation.</p>
<p>The condemnation follows a canned news bulletin by Fiji Television<br>tonight and a blank page and story spaces in today&#39;s Sunday edition of<br>the Fiji Times by news editors in protest over censored content.</p>
<p>Fijilive also reported &quot;withdrawing&quot; some news items as censors<br>maintained a presence in the country&#39;s newsrooms since the 30-day<br>Public Emergency Regulations came into force.</p>
<p>Some journalists reported a &quot;climate of silence&quot; in some newsrooms in<br>response to the censorship.</p>
<p>Associate Professor David Robie, director of New Zealand&#39;s AUT<br>University-based PMC, called on the Fiji regime of Commodore Voreqe<br>Bainimarama to &quot;end this Orwellian era of ruthless censorship and<br>intimidation&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The people of Fiji should be allowed free and unfettered media<br>coverage, especially at this time of uncertainty and anxiety,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;A gagged and intimidated media will only lead to rumours,<br>disinformation and more instability.&quot;</p>
<p>The regime earlier called on the nation&#39;s media to refrain from<br>publishing &quot;negative&quot; stories about the actions of the President Ratu<br>Josefa Iloilo over the past few days.</p>
<p>On Good Friday, the president abrogated the 1997 Constitution, sacked<br>the nation&#39;s judges and declared himself Head of State.</p>

<p>This followed a Court of Appeal judgment on Thursday which ruled that<br>the interim government of Prime Minister Bainimarama was illegal.</p>
<p>The president reappointed Bainimarama as prime minister and Fiji is now<br>being ruled by decree, including one that has imposed newsroom<br>censorship by Ministry of Information officials and police.</p>
<p>Editors were told not to publish or broadcast items that may involve<br>&quot;incitement&quot; and undermine law and order.</p>
<p>Major Neumi Leweni, who is also Permanent Secretary of Information,<br>asked all news media to “immediately refrain from publishing and<br>broadcasting any news item that is negative in nature, relating to the<br>assumption of executive authority on 10 April by his Excellency the<br>President, and the subsequent appointments of the Prime Minister and<br>Cabinet Ministers”.</p>
<p>Section 3 of the regulations state that anybody or organisation that <br>“fails in any way whatsoever&quot; to comply with the state provisions may<br>be ordered to &quot;cease all activities and operations&quot;.</p>
<p>In today&#39;s Sunday Times, page 2 was left blank apart from a downpage<br>box that declared: &quot;The stories on this page could not be published due<br>to government restrictions.&quot;</p>
<p>Five dummied up story spaces were left blank on page 3 and a political<br>cartoon space on the page 6 opinion section was also blank.</p>
<p>The ministry has reportedly warned the Fiji Times to stop leaving blank<br>spaces or face closure under the decree.</p>
<p>After leaving out an item in last night&#39;s 6pm bulletin news due to<br>censorship, Fiji Television pulled its main bulletin tonight.</p>
