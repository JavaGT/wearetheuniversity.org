<p>‘Good news for economy’ in Lincoln University graduation figures</p>
<p>Almost a third of the 656 degrees, diplomas and certificates being awarded at Lincoln University’s 2009 Graduation Ceremony in Christchurch Town Hall this Friday (24 April) are in fields related to New Zealand’s land-based industries such as agriculture, horticulture, viticulture and oenology.</p>
<p>“This is good news for the New Zealand economy,” says Vice-Chancellor Professor Roger Field. “The land-based industries are a high-science, highly commercial area and need a constant stream of university-qualified personnel to maintain international pre-eminence.”</p>
<p>Nineteen percent of all the awards being made on Friday are postgraduate qualifications, including 19 doctorates. Among these are PhDs in environmental accounting, plant pathology, forest science, ecological informatics, bacterial biosensors, marketing (wine) and landscape architecture.</p>
<p>“Lincoln University’s consistently strong position as a source of postgraduate qualified personnel is very positive news too,” says Professor Field. “The skills of advanced investigation and higher intellectual enquiry acquired in research degree programmes provide the foundation for scientific innovation and advances which are important economic and social drivers in a country like New Zealand.”</p>
<p>While Commerce degrees, diplomas and certificates remain the largest single category within Lincoln University’s graduation - around 44 percent of the total awards made, almost the same proportion as last year - many of these qualifications are also “land related”, for example valuation and property management, transport and logistics, and within the Commerce and Management degree, majors in areas such as supply chain management, agribusiness and international business.</p>

<p>Other significant qualification areas are - Landscape Architecture 31 awards, Environmental Management/Policy 30 awards and Recreation Management 29.</p>
<p>Of the 656 qualifications being awarded, 525 will be accepted in person and 131 will be made in absentia, a similar proportion to last year.</p>
<p>During the ceremony honorary doctorates will be conferred on mountaineer, winemaking consultant and entrepreneur Mark Inglis (honorary Doctor of Natural Resources) and on the foundation chairman of Fonterra John Roadley (honorary Doctor of Commerce).</p>
<p>The University’s Bledisloe Medal (instituted in 1930 and awarded for outstanding contributions to New Zealand’s interests by an alumnus or staff member) will be made to Emeritus Professor of Agricultural Economics Bruce Ross, and the University International Alumni Medal for outstanding contributions in an international student’s home country will be made to plant scientist Professor Mohammad Hanif Quazi of Pakistan.</p>
<p>Lincoln University awards for Excellence in Teaching will be made to Associate Professor in Toxicology Ravi Gooneratne of the Faculty of Agriculture and Life Sciences and jointly to Dr Gillis Maclean and Mr Paul McKeown of the Department of Accounting, Economics and Finance in the Commerce Faculty.</p>
<p>The ceremony starts at 2.00pm in Christchurch Town Hall and it will be presided over by the University’s Chancellor Mr Tom Lambie.</p>
