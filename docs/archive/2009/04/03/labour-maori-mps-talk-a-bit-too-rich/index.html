<p>MEDIA RELEASE<br>3 April 2009 – Co-Leaders of the Maori Party – Tariana Turia and Dr Pita Sharples</p>
<p>Labour Maori MPs’ talk a bit too rich</p>
<p>Labour Party MPs Parekura Horomia and Nanaia Mahuta have a cheek to blame the struggles of low-income Maori families on the Maori Party.</p>
<p>&quot;Our party isn’t happy that whanau didn’t get more benefit from the latest round of tax cuts and we’ve told National that, but its a bit rich for the two members to blame us for the poverty issues that plague Maori people,” Mrs Turia said.</p>
<p>“In the nine years their Labour Party was in power the pay gap between Maori and Pakeha actually increased – and that was in a decade of unprecedented economic growth, not a recession which is currently the case,” Dr Sharples said.</p>
<p>&quot;In Ikaroa-Rawhiti electorate the average Maori family had an income that was $14,000 a year lower than the average Pakeha family.”</p>
<p>“Just think of the things that those families had to go without by not having that additional spending power – and for nearly nine years both their MPs were ministers and should have been looking after their interests.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not only that, while Labour was in power, thousands of Maori decided they could no longer have a fair go in the land of their birth and headed off in droves to Australia.&quot;</p>
