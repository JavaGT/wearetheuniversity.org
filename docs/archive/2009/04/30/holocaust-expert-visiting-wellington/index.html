<p>MEDIA RELEASE<br>30 April 2009</p>
<p>Holocaust expert visiting Wellington</p>
<p>One of the word’s leading historians of the Holocaust is visiting Wellington next month where he will give lectures and meet with Holocaust survivors and their relatives.</p>
<p>Professor Omer Bartov, of Brown University, Rhode Island, will be at Victoria University from 18 to 21 May 2009 delivering a public lecture and seminars on the Holocaust and genocide.</p>
<p>He will be meeting with Holocaust survivors and their relatives when he speaks at the Jewish community centre on 19 May. While there he will also discuss the erased memory of the Holocaust in Eastern Europe and in particular, in Galicia, now a province of the Ukraine.</p>
<p>Victoria University is Professor Bartov’s only academic stop in New Zealand after lectures and talks in Sydney and Melbourne. He is regarded as one of the world’s leading historians of World War II, genocide and the Holocaust, with a CV of accomplishments and fellowships that reinforce that standing.</p>
<p>His public lecture at Victoria on 20 May, “The Holocaust and Genocide: Remembering the Twentieth Century”, will address how the Holocaust came to be seen as one of the most crucial events of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Dr. Simone Gigliotti of Victoria’s History Programme says the lecture will be a rare opportunity for New Zealanders to hear from a leading authority on a topic that is still the subject of international attention over 60 years later.</p>
<p>“The lecture comes hot on the heels of the recent UN conference on racism in Geneva where many delegates walked out when Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad referred to Israel as a racist state. There is little wonder that the Holocaust (and Holocaust denial) continue to be a subject of massive public and media interest.”</p>

He has been awarded fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Academy in Berlin, the Guggenheim Foundation, and others. He is the author of seven books and the editor of three volumes on topics including the representation and memory of the Holocaust, German soldiers in World War II, accountability for war crimes and genocide, and stereotypes of Jews in cinema.
