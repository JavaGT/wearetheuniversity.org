<p>Minister’s pre-budget statements concern students</p>
<p>Students are highly concerned with the Minister of Tertiary Education, Anne Tolley, who today has made worrying statements ahead of the Budget.</p>
<p>“At a time of global economic uncertainty, Governments around the world have made education a key plank in their economic stimulus packages” said Jordan King, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.</p>
<p>“There is a wide consensus that furthering invest in higher education is fundamental to getting the global economy back on track. Our Government, in the Budget, must not ignore the absolute importance of further investment in education – doing so will put the quality of tertiary education in New Zealand at risk “added King.</p>
<p>Tertiary Minister Anne Tolley refused to provide clear statements on funding plans during her remarks at the New Zealand Tertiary Education Summit today instead ominously noting that in relation to Tertiary Funding “right now is a time when our imperative has to be to constrain overall government costs”.</p>
<p>“Students will be rightly concerned that if government funding to institutions does not increase, the burden could fall onto individual students. Given that collective student debt is $10billion and rising, a position of continued underfunding is not only reckless but will actively contribute to inequitable outcomes in the tertiary sector” said King.</p>
<p>“Students question how running the tertiary system into the ground through funding shortages will achieve the Government’s strong desire to increase the quality of tertiary education and better outcomes for students” said King. “Appropriate investment in a quality tertiary education system is the mark of a responsible government. Ignoring sector underinvestment will result in missed opportunities for New Zealand” concluded King.</p>
