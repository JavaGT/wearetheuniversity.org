<p>22 April 2009 Media Statement</p>
<p>Groser not focussed on value of conservation</p>
<p>New Zealand’s conservation estate is a valuable asset that needs protecting, Labour Conservation Spokesperson Steve Chadwick says</p>
<p>“Tim Groser is a part-time Minister of Conservation who is missing the importance of New Zealand’s most precious resources; our natural environment,” Steve Chadwick.</p>
<p>“The Minister can simply not ‘do’ Conservation on a Thursday as he has reportedly instructed his staff.</p>
<p>“Leadership in the vital Conservation role takes more than one day a week if New Zealand is to continue to be a world leader in this area.</p>
<p>Ms Chadwick was disappointed that the Government had chosen to allow part of Oteake Conservation Park in North Otago to be used lignite mine sometime in the future.</p>
<p>“In Government Labour worked to protect this valuable land from ever being mined. It is disappointing that the National Party has not seen the value of protecting this land.</p>
<p>“There will be no benefit to New Zealand’s economy in the short-term from this move, but the damage done to our international reputation as a country that cares about the environment could be significant. Greenpeace have already condemned the move.</p>
<p>“The National Government needs to think of the Conservation Estate as a precious resource in itself that needs protecting rather than changing the boundaries to suit themselves,” Steve Chadwick said.</p>
