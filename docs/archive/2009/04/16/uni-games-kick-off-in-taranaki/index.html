<p>Press release – April 14, 2009</p>
<p>Uni Games kick off in Taranaki</p>
<p>The Uni Games 09 kicked off in New Plymouth tonight with a rousing haka from Taranaki Rugby League Academy players and high hopes from organisers.</p>
<p>About 1500 competitors have converged on Taranaki for the event, with Victoria University out to defend its hold on the tournament shield.</p>
<p>Louise Burns, executive director of University Sport New Zealand, found the opening haka inspiring and was greatly moved by an earlier powhiri held in the New Plymouth District Council chambers.</p>
<p>She’s keen for those positive feelings to keep flowing all week.</p>
<p>“I hope the students associated with university sport have the time of their lives,” she says.</p>
<p>USNZ board member Roger Wood shares those sentiments. “I want people to go back and talk about these as the best games they have been to. Some of us have parents who still talk about their experiences at Uni Games.”</p>
<p>This is only the second time a non-university province has held the games. The first time was last year, when the annual sports fixture, colloquially known as “the tourney” was held in Rotorua.</p>
<p>Taranaki won the right to hold the games following a united bid involving WITT, Sport Taranaki, Venture Taranaki and councils throughout the region.</p>
<p>“What I’m keen for is that the faith of these consortium members is repaid by the students being here,” Wood says.</p>
<p>Sport Taranaki CEO Howie Tamati believes they will be, especially as the games will help showcase the region.</p>

<p>“I hope they are successful and a wonderful experience for all the students that come here and they get an impression of Taranaki that we already know – that it’s the greatest place in New Zealand to live,” says the rugby league legend.</p>
<p>“I just hope the next three days are full of fun, friendship and fellowship – and the kids make relationships that last forever.”</p>
<p>The games are also about serious competition.</p>
<p>Taranaki Rugby League Academy captain Beau White says the WITT team is out to win.</p>
<p>“We are pretty confident. We have been training for the last eight weeks now and we are feeling pretty switched on. Just bring it on,” he says, revealing the team will be doing the haka before each game.</p>
<p>Along with rugby league, students will be competing in 25 different events, including surfing, tennis, 20-20 cricket, karate and much more.</p>
<p>Students from all over New Zealand, along with a team from Monash University in Melbourne, will be out to win titles. The finals will be held on Friday.</p>
