<p>Waikato University chemistry student to mingle with Nobel laureates</p>
<p>A talent for chemistry has landed Waikato University student Ben Deadman the rare opportunity to mingle with Nobel Prize winners.</p>
<p>Deadman, who’s just completing his Masters of Science in Chemistry, has been selected as a participant in the 59th Meeting of Nobel Prize Winners in Chemistry at Lindau in Germany later this year.</p>
<p>He was nominated by the Royal Society of New Zealand to be an ambassador for New Zealand at the June 28-July 3 gathering of promising young researchers and Nobel laureates.</p>
<p>“It’s a great opportunity,” says Deadman, a former student at Thames High School. “I’ll be joining around 600 researchers from all over the world for a week of lectures, discussions and networking.”</p>
<p>He’s currently seeking sponsorship to help cover the cost of his flights and accommodation.</p>
<p>In his Masters research, Deadman has been looking at the flavonoids, a class of anti-oxidant natural products, which can be used to identify the floral origins of different honeys.</p>
<p>After the Lindau meeting, he hopes to go on to a PhD at Cambridge University, where he’ll work on natural product synthesis under the supervision of Prof Steven Ley, CBE, BP Professor of Chemistry at Cambridge and a Fellow of the Royal Society, who heads the Innovative Technology Centre.</p>
<p>“I’ve been looking at natural products, and now I’m going to try and make them,” says Deadman. “I’m looking forward to being challenged academically and exploring a new research area.”</p>
