<p>1 April 2009 Media Statement<br>Thomson sacking proved to be an empty gesture</p>
<p>The sacking of Otago DHB Chair Richard Thomson by Health Minister Tony Ryall last month was an empty, vindictive political gesture and has resulted in no changes at the board since, Dunedin South MP Clare Curran said today.</p>
<p>“New Otago DHB Chair Errol Millar today confirmed at a Health Select Committee in Wellington today that there had been no substantive changes since Mr Thomson’s sacking and that he had been working closely with and consulting Mr Thomson, who remains a member of the Board,” Curran said.</p>
<p>“Last month Health Minister Tony Ryall sacked Mr Thomson as a blatant political reprisal, using him as a scapegoat for the nearly $17 million dollar fraud at the DHB which resulted in the imprisonment of the board’s former IT manager.</p>
<p>“Mr Thomson had helped bring the fraud to light and he has subsequently driven a robust process to prevent future fraud at the DHB.</p>
<p>“His sacking was widely opposed by the board and clinical staff and he had widespread public support.</p>
<p>“Mr Miller confirmed to the select committee today that he stood by his previous reported statements made on his appointment as the new chair, that had he been the chair at the time of the fraud he wouldn’t have done anything different to Mr Thomson.</p>
<p>“Mr Miller said he was now working closely with Mr Thomson as he familiarised himself with the new job, and was regularly consulting Mr Thomson in his position as chair of the Otago DHB’s Hospital Advisory Committee (HAC).</p>
<p>“All this goes to show that sacking Richard Thomson hasn’t made a bit of difference at the Otago DHB other than creating distress for the board, the staff and the people of Otago.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders should be watching Mr Ryall’s movements closely as he turns his sights on other target for political reprisals,” Curran said.</p>
