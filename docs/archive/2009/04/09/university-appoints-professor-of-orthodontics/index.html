<p>University appoints Professor of Orthodontics</p>
<p>A leading orthodontics researcher from Switzerland has been appointed as Professor of Orthodontics at the University of Otago’s School of Dentistry.</p>
<p>Dr Mauro Farella is an Italian citizen currently based at the Centre for Oral Medicine and Maxillofacial Surgery at the University of Zurich. He will take up his appointment at Otago later this year.</p>
<p>Dr Farella has published extensively in international peer-reviewed journals and has taught at European universities and worked as a clinical orthodontist and instructor since 1993.</p>
<p>His clinical work has included private practice as well as teaching at the University of Naples Federico II in Italy.</p>
<p>Among his current research interests are measuring the effectiveness of appliances used in orthodontics, evidence-based dentistry and web-based randomised control trials in orthodontics and clinical gnathology. Gnathology is the study of the physiology, problems and treatments involved in jaw functioning.</p>
<p>Dr Farella has taught undergraduate and postgraduate courses at the University of Zurich and at the University of Naples Federico II. His areas of teaching include orthodontics, oral-facial pain and disorders affecting the joint of the jaw.</p>
<p>He is a member of several professional societies including the European Orthodontic Society, the Society of Oral Physiology and the European Academy for Craniomandibular Disorders.</p>
<p>School of Dentistry Dean Professor Gregory Seymour says that Dr Farella will be a valuable addition to the School’s Department of Oral Sciences.</p>
<p>“I look forward to Dr Farella’s arrival and the considerable research, teaching and clinical contributions he will make through his role here,” Professor Seymour says.</p>
<p>Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Health Sciences) Professor Don Roberton welcomed Dr Farella’s appointment.</p>
<p>“The School of Dentistry has a longstanding international reputation for the excellence of its research and teaching. Dr Farella is well-placed to further enhance this reputation within his discipline area,” Professor Roberton says.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg says it is very pleasing that the University has been able to appoint an academic and clinician of Dr Farella’s outstanding calibre to the position.</p>
