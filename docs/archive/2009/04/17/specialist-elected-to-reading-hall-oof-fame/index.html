<p>Friday, April 17, 2009<br>Massey literacy specialist elected to international Reading Hall of Fame</p>
<p>Professor Tom Nicholson from the University’s College of Education is one of 100 international academics elected to the Reading Hall of Fame based in the United States.</p>
<p>The Reading Hall of Fame was established in 1973 to contribute to further improvement in reading instruction from the collective experiences of its members. Strict membership criteria for the hall requires those elected to have an international reputation in the profession and to have made major contributions in the area of publications and research.</p>
<p>Professor Nicholson is Professor of Literacy Education in the School of Education at Albany and Co-Coordinator of the Massey University Centre of Excellence for Research on Children’s Literacy. He has a PhD from the University of Minnesota, which won him the International Reading Association PhD thesis award.</p>
<p>He has an impressive list of close to 200 publications, many of which have appeared in leading peer-reviewed journals. He has also published more than 20 books, some of which have become set texts for undergraduate and postgraduate university classes in many countries.</p>
<p>College of Education Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor James Chapmen today congratulated Professor Nicholson, describing his election as &quot;a major achievement that is thoroughly deserved.</p>
<p>&quot;Tom is an experienced and highly-regarded teacher,&quot; Professor Chapman says. &quot;He teaches in the Master of Literacy Education programme and in the Graduate Diploma in Teaching programme at Albany and contributes to various other programmes. He also runs three reading clinics in the Auckland region aimed at helping children who have reading and spelling difficulties.</p>
<p>&quot;It is in these clinics he puts his research into practice and this has benefited a large number of children in the Auckland region over the years.&quot;</p>
