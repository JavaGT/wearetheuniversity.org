<p><strong>Tuesday, 21 April 2009, 1:37 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party">The Maori Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Tariana Turia<br>Co-Leader of the Maori Party<br>21 April 2009 Media Statement</p>
<p>Happy birthday Kingi Tuheitia</p>
<p>Hari huritau ki a koe, hari huritau ki a koe, hari huritau e te Kingi Tuheitia, hari huritau ki a koe.</p>
<p>“On this day in world history Rome was founded, the moon was explored for the first time by the Apollo 16 astronauts and William III and Mary II were crowned joint king and queen of England, Scotland and Ireland,” Maori Party co-leader Tariana Turia said.</p>
<p>“But here in Aotearoa, something took place on this same day in 1955 that was of much more relevance to the people of Te Ao Maori – the birth of Tuheitia Paki.”</p>
<p>“I can appreciate that since ascending to the throne Kingi Tuheitia’s official duties would be huge so we hope that he will at least get the chance to spend time with his wife Te Atawhai, their three children, his father Whatumoana and the rest of his whanau on this very special day.”</p>
<p>“It was a privilege for my colleague Dr Pita Sharples and I to take part in the King’s birthday celebrations at Waikato University today. And on his very special day, we in the Maori Party wish him a very happy birthday with many more to come”</p>
