<p><strong>Media Alert: Billy Apple Exhibition extended to 7 June</strong></p>
<p>The Adam Art Gallery exhibition <em>Billy Apple New York 1969-1973</em> will be extended until Sunday 7 June.</p>
<p>For further information about this exhibition please see: <a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz/adamartgallery">http://www.victoria.ac.nz/adamartgallery</a></p>
<p>Billy Apple’s work will also be on show in Europe from May-September in a major survey curated by Nicolaus Schafhausen and Zöe Gray at the Witte de With Centre for Contemporary Art, Rotterdam.</p>
<p>This significant exhibition is comprised of two parts, opening four weeks apart. The first instalment, titled <em>Billy Apple®: A History of the Brand</em>, opens on Saturday 30 May, presenting a body of work that records Apple_®_’s gradual transformation from an individual artist into a brand. The second part of the exhibition, titled <em>Billy Apple®: Revealed/Concealed</em>, will open on Thursday 25 June. For this project, Billy Apple® will transform Witte de With&#39;s second floor, as part of a new commission that evokes his series of architectural interventions and his ongoing institutional critique.</p>
<p>The two-part exhibition also extends into public space with a series of billboard commissions, and a monographic publication by Witte de With Publishers will be produced on his work including an essay by Director of the Adam Art Gallery and curator of <em>Billy Apple New York 1969-1973</em>, Christina Barton.</p>

<p>The Future is Unwritten<br>11 July – 6 September 2009<br>Opening: Friday 10 July, 6pm<br>Nine young artists, designers and writers have been invited to produce new works that speculate on the future by envisaging ‘what could happen next’. Basing their propositions on their understanding of the current situation and using the structures of the building and the online space of the gallery website, they will develop works that address the pertinent issue of whether contemporary art can have political efficacy as a tool for re-engaging with and imagining the future. The exhibition is curated by Laura Preston.</p>
<p>A public programme of discussion, film screenings and workshops will accompany this exhibition project.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that the Gallery will be closed between 8 June and 11 July. During this time Athfield Architects will be redesigning the entry of the gallery and staff will be working to install the next exhibition.</strong><br>ENDS  </p>
