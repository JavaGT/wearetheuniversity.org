<p>Successful Summit – Expert Engagement<br>Monday, 25 May 2009</p>
<p>”Whether the issue is stripping worker’s rights, introducing boot camps or destroying Auckland democracy – the National Party has ignored a chorus of expert voices in favour of its own schizophrenia and self-superiority.” Young Labour President, Patrick Leyland, said this morning.</p>
<p>In direct contrast with the Nat’s wafer thin election slogans and actions in government, Labour has shown a great respect for expert opinion. National have only been in power for 6 months and they have already left a path around the Beehive littered with broken promises, an acute fear of consultation and a flagrant disregard of expert opinion (labelled “misleading” whenever inconvenient).</p>
<p>“Labour does not pretend to know all the answers and Sunday’s Youth Job Summit was a perfect example of substantive consultation with those who know best.” Mr Leyland said.</p>
<p>Young Labour attended the full day summit, along with over 60 experts from NGOs, unions, academics, student groups and business. The inclusive invite list provided a healthy level of debate and a broad church of opinion. However, this diversity did not come at the expense of plan to go forward.</p>
<p>“There was consensus on many issues,” said Jacinda Ardern, Labour’s Spokesperson for Youth Affairs. These included:</p>
<p>* The very vulnerable position of those at the margins of the workforce – notably youth and ethnic minorities<br>* The urgent need to adequately fund tertiary education<br>* The importance of upskilling – with an emphasis on literacy and numeracy<br>* The need to provide better support and information as young people move between school, ongoing skills training and employment.</p>

<p>Mr Leyland pointed out the constructive nature of the summit. “This was not about navel gazing – rather generating ideas for the future. The Young Labour delegation was particularly impressed by the idea of introducing a scheme to prevent ‘a lost generation’ of long-term youth unemployed.”</p>
<p>“A ‘Guaranteed Employment or Training’ programme has been introduced in the UK and Young Labour would be keen to see it introduced in NZ.”</p>
<p>“With an extra 10,300 young people now without jobs within the March quarter alone, there is an urgent need for action. However, this urgency must not be used to avoid full consultation – an excuse too often used by the National Party to silence dissent.” Mr Leyland concluded.</p>
