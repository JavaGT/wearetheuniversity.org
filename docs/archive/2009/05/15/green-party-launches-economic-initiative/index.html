<p>Green Party Launches Economic Initiative</p>
<p>The Green Party begins a nationwide conversation on the economy today, presenting a billion-dollar stimulus package in 15 towns and cities and delivering its economic message to more than 300,000 New Zealand homes.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re engaging on economic issues on a new scale,&quot; Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said today. &quot;A Green New Deal aims to save the economy and the environment at the same time. We&#39;re talking to New Zealanders ahead of the Budget about how this approach works and what it might look like in Aotearoa, so they can compare it to the Government&#39;s plans.&quot;</p>
<p>Countries around the world were busy adopting Green New Deal programmes, Ms Fitzsimons said, and New Zealand&#39;s National-led Government was conspicuous by its absence.</p>
<p>Green Party Co-Leader Russel Norman said the Green New Deal approach was common-sense: &quot;We&#39;re inviting New Zealanders to meet with our MPs and talk about a relatively simple approach that can solve several problems at one time.&quot;</p>
<p>The Green Party&#39;s nine MPs will take part in a listening tour of New Zealand that begins with MP Kennedy Graham in Timaru this afternoon. &quot;Most politicians like to talk. We want to listen,&quot; Dr Norman said. &quot;We think New Zealanders will have plenty of ideas. They know that the country has finite space and resources and we can&#39;t have infinite growth in resource use. They&#39;ll have advice about how we move to a sustainable economy.</p>
<p>&quot;When you talk to coal miners on the West Coast, for example, they know the industry is not sustainable and they want to talk about what they can do for a living instead. That&#39;s a Green New Deal conversation.&quot; The proposed Green New Deal was also a fair deal for all New Zealanders, Dr Norman noted.</p>

<p>As part of the Green New Deal tour, Green MPs will present a billion dollar stimulus package including a series of &#39;shovel-ready&#39; projects that create jobs and stimulate the economy in a way that responds to pressing environmental problems including climate change.</p>
<p>The proposed package covers: energy efficiency, transport efficiency, protecting waterways, building more homes and community sector initiatives. The stimulus spending over the next 3 years amounts to just over $1B per year -approximately the same amount the National-led Government has spent to combat the recession so far, and less than most other countries.</p>
<p>Cleaning up New Zealand&#39;s rivers and streams was a good example of a Green New Deal initiative, according to Dr Norman. &quot;We&#39;ve got a pollution problem due to livestock and farm runoff. It&#39;s a threat to our food and tourism markets and our &quot;clean green&quot; brand plus it means our kids can&#39;t swim in the local river.&quot;</p>
<p>The Green Party&#39;s proposal would see fencing and planting projects around New Zealand to provide jobs and support rural businesses such as fencing suppliers and plant nurseries. &quot;We estimate that by spending $200m per year we create nearly 5,000 jobs and that our streams and rivers could be protected in just nine years.&quot;</p>
<p>The Green Party&#39;s Green New Deal message is also going directly to more than 300,000 New Zealand homes with thousands of volunteers hand-delivering a Green New Deal newsletter to letterboxes throughout the country beginning this weekend.</p>
