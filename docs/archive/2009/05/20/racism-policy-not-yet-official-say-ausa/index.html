<p><strong>Media Release – 20 May 2009 – For Immediate Use</strong></p>
<p><strong>Racism Policy not yet official, say AUSA</strong></p>
<p>A motion passed at an Auckland University students’ forum today, labelling National Party by-election candidate Melissa Lee racist, is not yet official AUSA policy, says Darcy Peacock, President of the Auckland University Students’ Association.</p>
<p>While a Student Forum labeled Ms. Lee racist, such meetings can only recommend resolutions to the students’ association executive for approval.</p>
<p>“Lively debate at Student Forums is common, and the process to consider these motions is robust,” said AUSA President Darcy Peacock. “Clearly, many students were unhappy with the comments made by Lee and came to the quad today to make their opinions heard” Peacock added.</p>
<p>With speeches from Labour, National, ACT and Greens, some students heckled Lee throughout the debate and an election sign was captured by activists.</p>
<p>“Policies approved by the Student Forum are submitted to the student executive for discussion and further approval” said AUSA Administrative Vice President Joe McCrory.</p>
<p>“While students led a very heated debate on the statement made last week by Ms. Lee, the Association executive has not yet considered the policy”, added Peacock.</p>
<p>“AUSA will be seeking further input from student groups before making an official statement on our position” Peacock concluded.</p>
