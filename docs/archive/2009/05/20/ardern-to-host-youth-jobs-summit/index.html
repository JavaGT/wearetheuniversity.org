<p>Ardern to host youth jobs summit</p>
<p>The sharp increase in youth unemployment and ways to tackle it will be thrashed out at a youth jobs summit to be hosted by Labour Youth Affairs spokesperson Jacinda Ardern this weekend.</p>
<p>“Young workers are some of the most vulnerable in troubled economic times and the latest unemployment figures are evidence of that,” Jacinda Ardern said.</p>
<p>“In the March quarter unemployment for those aged 15-19 years has risen from 17.9 percent to 19.6 percent. Sadly the news is much worse for those in the 20-24 age group; unemployment has jumped 7.3 percent to 12 percent.</p>
<p>“That’s an extra 10,300 young people who are now without jobs.”</p>
<p>Jacinda Ardern says the focus of Sunday’s youth jobs summit is to look for ways to turn around that trend.</p>
<p>“There is a real need for an open and urgent debate on youth unemployment. The summit will be an opportunity to generate ideas to address this issue of National importance,” Jacinda Ardern said.</p>
<p>Jacinda Ardern says the summit will not be a political forum. Representatives from all political parties represented in Parliament have been invited.</p>
<p>“This summit must spark real solutions to tackle youth unemployment, and because of that I have asked a number of experts to give their thoughts on the problem.</p>
<p>The panel of speakers includes:<br>•/Phil O’Reilly, CEO of Business New Zealand<br>•/Peter Conway, Secretary of NZ Council of Trade Unions<br>•/Michael Goldstein, Deputy Chair, Student Job Search<br>•/Jeremy Baker, Executive Director, Industry Training Federation<br>•/Benedickte Jensen, Research Director, New Zealand Institute<br>•/Ed Moses, Snr Policy Advisor, UK Dept for Children, School and Families</p>
