<p><strong>Friday, 29 May 2009, 1:07 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University">Massey University</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Friday, May 29, 2009</strong><br><strong>AVC Academic and Open Learning appointed</strong></p>
<p>Professor Ingrid Day has been appointed the University&#39;s Assistant Vice-Chancellor – Academic and Open Learning.</p>
<p>Professor Day joins Massey from a recent role at Macquarie University where, as acting Executive Dean of the Faculty of Arts seconded from the University of South Australia, she led the successful commencement of a new cohesive faculty with a clear strategic direction. Prior to this Professor Day was involved in the university-wide renewal of the teaching and learning framework at the University of South Australia and built a reputation for being able to lead collaboration and achieve change on a broad scale through effective communication and credibility as a champion for teaching and learning.</p>
<p>She grew up in South Australia’s Barossa Valley, studied in Adelaide and gained her PhD in Communication from the University of South Australia. She has two young adult children who are keen to eventually join her and husband Barry in New Zealand.</p>
<p>She began her academic career in distance education and has demonstrated a significant track record of achievement in leading improvements to the quality of teaching and improved student satisfaction and as an elected staff representative on the University&#39;s governing body.</p>
<p>University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says he is delighted to welcome someone of Professor Day&#39;s calibre to Massey at a time when the University is looking to make major changes in both its internal and extramural teaching programmes. &quot;Professor Day&#39;s record of leadership in this area brings significant strength to the University&#39;s Senior Leadership Team,&quot; Mr Maharey says.</p>
<p>An immediate focus of the position is to develop a sustainable and successful long term distance learning strategy and to lead the college pro vice-chancellors in shaping the academic programme that will define Massey as a world centre for teaching and learning in our areas of specialisation.</p>
<p>Professor Day will take up the role on July 13.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
