<p>Tariana Turia is calling for all wall barriers in Wellington region’s waterways to be removed as they are making it hard for Maori whanau to resort to traditional food sources in these tough financial times.</p>
<p>“With high food costs and less money going around, a number of Maori whanau are turning to our forests, rivers and streams for food,” Mrs Turia said.</p>
<p>“These walls are blocking the passage of eels and other fish through our waterways and therefore the Wellington Regional Council and other district councils in the region need to remove them as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>It is understood that most of the wall barriers are no longer required and were built prior to 1994, Mrs Turia said.</p>
<p>“I will be writing to all of those councils stressing the importance of these walls being removed.”</p>
<p>Research from Massey University showed that the population of long-fin eels was on a dramatic decline in Wellington’s waterways.</p>
<p>The university was also calling for a moratorium on the commercial fishing of long-fin eels – a move which Mrs Turia supported and which she intended to follow-up with the Minister of Fisheries.</p>
