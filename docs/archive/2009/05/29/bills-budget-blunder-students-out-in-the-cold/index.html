<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>Bill&#39;s Budget Blunder – Students out in the Cold</p>
<p>“Students are out in the cold”, was how protest organiser Ella Hardy described her reaction to National&#39;s first budget, released today to widespread disapproval amongst Otago University&#39;s student population Students will march in Dunedin tomorrow in protest against National&#39;s budget, expressing their lack of confidence in the National-led government</p>
<p>This budget has nothing but missed opportunities, both for young people and the rest of New Zealand.</p>
<p>At a time of recession, this budget offers no hope for the 180,000 Kiwis National predicts will be out of work. Bill English seems more focused on debt reduction than job creation. Research and development takes a back seat as National slashes the $700 million fast forward fund to one tenth of its previous levels.</p>
<p>Bill English used the word debt 35 times in this budget but didn&#39;t once mention the crippling burden of $10 billion of student debt.</p>
<p>“This budget falls woefully short in many ways. It fails to provide for the future of superannuation, fails to provide for future jobs, fails to safeguard our environment and fails to provide for students.” said Ella Hardy.</p>
<p>“National&#39;s bright future is nothing but a grey reality brought home by a backwards budget”, Ella Hardy said, <br> <br>Students will march from the Otago University Union Lawn at 12pm to protest outside Micheal Woodhouse&#39;s National Party Office.<br> <br>ENDS</p>
