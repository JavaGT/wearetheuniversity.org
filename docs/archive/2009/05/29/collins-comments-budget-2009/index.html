<p><strong>Friday, 29 May 2009, 9:42 am</strong><br><strong>Column: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Collins Comments<br>29 May 2009<br><strong>600 more frontline police confirmed – 300 for Counties Manukau by the end of 2010</strong> The Government will put the extra 300 officers into frontline roles in Counties-Manukau by the end of 2010 and there will be 300 more officers across the rest of New Zealand by the end of 2011.</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s top priority for policing has been to increase the number of officers directly delivering services to the public and we&#39;re honouring that commitment.</p>
<p>There is no better deterrent to crime than police officers out on the beat and on patrol in our communities. We need more police to tackle violence, maintain order and ensure that all New Zealanders can feel safe in their homes, on the streets and in their communities.</p>
<p>With the funding announced today, this Government is delivering on its promise. This commitment will give the public greater confidence in the police’s capacity to prevent, respond to and investigate crime.”</p>
<p>Budget 2009 provides $162.5 million of operating funding over four years for Police recruitment, training, personnel costs and deployment.</p>
<p>It will also include extra police support for prosecutions. A further $20 million of capital funding in 2009/10 and 2010/11 will provide accommodation and vehicles for the additional police.</p>
<p><strong>A Budget that sets out New Zealand’s Road to Recovery</strong></p>
<p>Many household budgets are stretched these days and it’s even harder to make ends meet when a household suffers a loss in income. When that happens, you have to reprioritise what you spend your money on, what needs are most important to the family, and, what has to be put off for another day.</p>

<p>The Government was in exactly this position when it put together Budget 2009. Due to the deepest recession since the 1930s, the Government is faced with falling revenues and increasing demands on our important social services.</p>
<p>That’s why this Budget has focused on initiatives that continue to support jobs, maintain entitlements for those on low incomes, and take the necessary steps to get the country’s finances back in good shape.</p>
<p>Having a job is the best security a family can have. Our plan to build better roads, more state houses, modern schools and faster broadband will support thousands of new jobs. Many more will be created by insulating homes up and down the country as part of the Budget’s home insulation programme. This programme will not only create work in our communities but also vastly improve the health of our children, our families, and our elderly who will be able to enjoy warmer and drier homes.</p>
<p>These initiatives will employ New Zealanders and create work for businesses throughout the regions, whether they are builders, plumbers or electricians. Their benefits will flow through communities by helping keep suppliers and sub-contractors, shopkeepers and sales staff in business.</p>
<p>This Budget also creates new frontline jobs including 600 more police, 246 more probation workers and hundreds of extra training places for doctors and nurses.</p>
<p>Increased unemployment is one of the harshest effects of the global recession. We cannot reverse that, but we are taking steps to cushion New Zealanders from its sharpest edges.</p>
<p>In this Budget we have also outlined our commitment to maintaining entitlements such as Working For Families, Superannuation and other benefits and allowances. Families and households have already experienced difficulty in making ends meet and we believe it’s important that the Government provides continuity of these entitlements.</p>
<p>This Budget was also about getting the Government’s finances in better shape. Large spending increases simply cannot continue while revenue is dropping. We aren’t prepared to load our children’s generation with debt. Households are taking stock of the things they spend money on - the Government has to do the same.</p>
<p>In the midst of an economic downturn we’ve pursued a Budget that is balanced and sensible.</p>
<p>National is confident about New Zealand’s prospects over the next few years. We believe New Zealand has a genuine opportunity to emerge from the recession in a stronger position than most other countries. Budget 2009 is the first step to ensuring that happens.</p>
