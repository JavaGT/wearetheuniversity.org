<p>Melissa Lee, National Candidate for the Mt Albert By-election was pleased to welcome Agriculture Minister, Hon. David Carter to the electorate today.</p>
<p>“While the urban area of Auckland is probably as far from the farm, as you can get in New Zealand, at the heart of the Mount Albert electorate is a model farm.” Said Melissa Lee.</p>
<p>Mr Carter and Melissa Lee visited the Mount Albert Grammar School Farm which provides agricultural training to students, as well as providing valuable green space to local residents.</p>
<p>The Farm was established in 1933 and occupies some 10.8 hectares. It is a unique rural experience middle of New Zealand&#39;s largest city.</p>
<p>Melissa Lee said “I was very proud to show the Minister that Mt Albert has such a unique and valuable learning facility.”</p>
<p>Hon. David Carter said “I was pleased to see that there is this opportunity to introduce young Aucklanders to New Zealand’s most important industry. The agricultural sector needs more skilled workers to support its continued development.”</p>
<p>Melissa Lee said “As a local MP, I will be working to bring more Ministers into the Mt Albert electorate, so that constituents can let their views be known directly to the government.”</p>
