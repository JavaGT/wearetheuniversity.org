<p>Reinforcing Faith In New Zealand Society</p>
<p>Hon Heather Roy, ACT Deputy Leader </p>
<p>Friday May 15 2009</p>
<p>A &#39;Dominion Post&#39; article caught my eye this week and got me thinking about what it is that sets New Zealanders apart.  The article was about Kiwi physiotherapist and former Wellingtonian Damon Newrick - now living in London - who recently received a commendation from police for rescuing a woman from three brutal attackers.</p>
<p>According to the article, Damon was having dinner at his North London flat when he heard a scream.  He raced downstairs to find a woman being strangled by three &quot;quite large&quot; men and covered in blood from where her attackers had torn out her earrings.</p>
<p>While onlookers stood idly by, Damon - despite being outnumbered - shouted at the men to leave the woman alone and tackled one of them.  He pulled the woman inside his building and held the door closed while the men attempted to kick it in.  As the glass began to give way, he pushed the woman up the stairs and prepared for the worst.</p>
<p>Once inside, however, the men grabbed a set of keys they had dropped and fled.</p>
<p>Pleasing as it was to read that the hero of the day was a New Zealander, I have to admit that I was not surprised to read of yet another Kiwi who saved the day while others did nothing.</p>
<p>All too often our attention is captured by the negative aspects of our society.  The stories that are most often newsworthy tend to focus on troubled young people, or those who are in trouble.  There is a general feeling that our country and our society have hit rock bottom.</p>

<p>At times it is easy to lose sight of the fact that incidents like these are exceptions, rather than the rule.  But it is stories like that of Damon Newrick that serve to remind us of the true state of New Zealand society and the nature of New Zealanders at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Throughout the world, New Zealanders are respected as fine ambassadors for our country - people like Willie Apiata and Sir Edmund Hillary spring instantly to mind but there is any number of fine examples.</p>
<p>Then there are those who serve our country with pride and bravery as our internationally respected Defence Force servicemen and women do.  Those achieving great physical feats and exhibiting selfless actions serve to improve our society and others.</p>
<p>Also respected overseas are our police, firefighters, ex-patriots, and young Kiwis travelling on their OEs - all carrying with them the values and morals instilled in us since birth.  This was highlighted when Damon Newrick attributed his actions to his upbringing:</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s just what we got taught; you help where you can.  The one thing that went through my mind was, &#39;I can&#39;t ring up Dad and say I saw this thing happen but didn&#39;t really help.&quot;</p>
<p>Following the &#39;Dominion Post&#39; article, I wrote an article of my own about Damon and posted it on my blog (<a href="http://www.roy.org.nz/royters/hero-the-day">http://www.roy.org.nz/royters/hero-the-day</a>).  I&#39;ve never met Damon but he saw my article and later emailed me (<a href="http://www.roy.org.nz/royters/message-damon-newrick">http://www.roy.org.nz/royters/message-damon-newrick</a>), saying:</p>
<p>&quot;I come from a largely typical New Zealand family, with my sister and I being brought up in Upper Hutt and attending the local Catholic schools.  The values that were instilled in me and my friends by parents, teachers and the community as we grew up are still carried with us around the world today ...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; ... while talking to one of the policemen involved in the case, it was mentioned that all too often the people who step to assist in incidents such as the one I was involved in are in fact either New Zealanders or Australians ... everyday, I am a proud Kiwi taking a message to the world about the way we do things back in New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>This selfless bravery and humble response to the subsequent attention are the hallmarks of New Zealand society.  Rather than play to the limelight we prefer to simply put our heads down and continue on with our lives.</p>
<p>So what is it that makes Kiwis different?  Our &#39;No 8 Wire&#39; mentality, perhaps, combined with our inherent knowledge of right and wrong?  Others see incidents like this and have a choice to make; New Zealanders like Damon Newrick see no such decision - they act instinctively and do the right thing, and many other Kiwis around the world behave similarly when the need has arisen.</p>
<p>As a result of his courage Damon has received a commendation from London police for bravery, and once again the regard in which our country is held is reinforced around the world.</p>
<p>Lest We Forget - Charles Upham Awarded VC And Bar (May 11 1945)<br>Born in Christchurch, Charles Upham volunteered for service at the outbreak of WWII and to this day symbolises what many New Zealanders view as the essential qualities of the typical New Zealand soldier.</p>
<p>Upham developed these qualities as a Canterbury high country musterer, and reports at the time attributed New Zealand&#39;s success in war to the rigours of rural life - in which one had to be physically and mentally rugged to cope with ruggedness of the land around them.</p>
<p>Fiercely loyal to his comrades, Upham earned his VC in Crete in 1941 and his Bar at Ruweisat Ridge in 1942.  Severely wounded at Ruweisat Ridge, he was captured by the Germans and made a failed escape attempt while recuperating in an Italian hospital.  He was then transferred to Germany in September 1943.  In 1944, following a daring solo attempt to scale his POW camp&#39;s barbed-wire fence in broad daylight, he became the only New Zealand combatant officer sent to the notorious Colditz camp.</p>
<p>Always averse to the limelight, Upham was reportedly distressed when he was later informed of his first VC for outstanding gallantry and leadership in Crete.  Believing that others deserved it more and reluctant to be singled out, he could only accept the award by seeing it as recognition of the bravery and service of his entire unit.</p>
<p>When Major-General Howard Kippenberger recommended Upham for a second VC, King George VI responded that a Bar to the VC would be unusual.  When he asked if Upham deserved it, Kippenberger replied that Upham had earned the VC several times over.</p>
<p>Upham later attended Buckingham Palace and became the first, and to this day only, combat soldier to be awarded a Bar to his Victoria Cross − the highest British decoration for members of the New Zealand armed forces for valour on active service.</p>
