<p>Mt Albert A Two Horse Race<br>John Boscawen MP<br>ACT New Zealand</p>
<p>Immediate Release: Monday, May 11 2009</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Mt Albert candidate John Boscawen today welcomed National candidate Melissa Lee&#39;s - albeit unintentional – announcement that her Party will build a road in Mt Albert as opposed to the obviously unaffordable tunnel option.</p>
<p>&quot;At last Ms Lee has come clean - even though she had to be backed into a corner to admit it,&quot; Mr Boscawen said.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT has always favoured a surface route and has been upfront with Mt Albert residents from the start. A $2.77 billion tunnel is a luxury we cannot afford. As such it is pleasing that Ms Lee supports ACT&#39;s view that we need to focus on reducing Government spending - rather than encouraging massive borrowing that will put our children&#39;s future&#39;s in jeopardy.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT has investigated an alternative surface route that utilises the existing rail corridor to the south of Hendon Avenue and continues north-east of Oakley Stream. This involves the removal of fewer than 50 houses - far fewer than David Shearer&#39;s tunnel option, which will result in the removal of over 100 houses.</p>
<p>&quot;I now urge Green Party candidate Dr Russel Norman to lend his support to this option, and drop his totally unrealistic idea and non-sensible notion that the motorway should stop in Mt Roskill and disgorge thousands of cars daily onto Mt Albert Streets.</p>
<p>&quot;The stupidity and insincerity of what Mr Norman peddles was exposed in the candidates&#39; interview on Auckland University radio 95bFM today, where he expressed concern about a few additional cars exiting the proposed 24-hour McDonalds restaurant in Balmoral.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Norman&#39;s hypocrisy knows no bounds - he is happy for thousands of cars daily to disgorge onto Mt Albert Streets, but raises this as an objection to the proposed McDonalds restaurant.</p>
<p>&quot;The reality is that this is a two-horse race between myself and David Shearer - Mr Norman&#39;s comment today only serves to underline that fact,&quot; Mr Boscawen said.</p>
