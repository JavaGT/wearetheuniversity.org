<p>Tuesday, May 12, 2009<br>Research measures sustainability of organics</p>
<p>A Massey University researcher has found organic fruit growing operations are environmentally sustainable and could trade carbon credits in the future.</p>
<p>Girija Page graduated yesterday with a PhD in Agricultural and Horticultural Systems and Management. She developed a framework to assess the sustainability of organic fruit growing, which will help gauge the efficacy of horticultural systems.</p>
<p>Her research analysed energy efficiency and environmental impacts of organic kiwifruit and organic apple growing operations in the Bay of Plenty and the Hawke’s Bay.</p>
<p>“New Zealand has a reputation for producing export goods that are thought to have less impact on the environment,” Dr Page says. “International markets are seeking goods that have been produced in this way, so this research fits well with the Government’s focus on sustainability and life cycle analysis.”</p>
<p>The assessment was based on two criteria: efficient use of energy and non-degradation of the environment from energy and material use. Indicators that address the two criteria for sustainability were identified, such as energy efficiency, CO2 ratio, changes in the soil carbon level, nutrient balances and the leaching of nitrogen.</p>
<p>“I found that the organic orchard systems were sustainable in terms of energy use and most of the environmental impacts they had on the soil, water and atmosphere,” she says. “In fact, they were a carbon sink, so they could potentially trade carbon credits under the Kyoto Protocol.”</p>

<p>Dr Page came to Massey on a doctoral scholarship after completing her undergraduate and Master’s degrees in India and Europe. She was supported by the Cecil Elliot Trust of New Zealand.</p>
<p>“I have always been interested in sustainability, but never found a definitive answer to the question of whether organics was truly sustainable. I hope my research begins to answer that question.”</p>
<p>More research is needed involving a larger number of organic orchard systems in New Zealand to back up her findings.</p>
<p>“Also, some of the data came from international literature, so it would be good to have similar data available from within New Zealand.”</p>
