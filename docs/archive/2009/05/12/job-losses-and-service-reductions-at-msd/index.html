<p><strong>Tuesday, 12 May 2009, 2:16 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Grant Robertson<br>State Services Spokesperson</p>
<p>12 May 2009 Media Statement<br>Job losses and service reductions at MSD</p>
<p>As the unemployment line lengthens it is clear the National government is not giving the Social Development Ministry the resources it needs to provide New Zealanders the services they deserve, Grant Robertson State Services Spokesperson says.</p>
<p>“The announcement that at least 200 jobs will be lost at the Ministry of Social Development means that staff providing services to the public will spend more time on administration at the cost of time spent helping those who need it,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>&quot;Make no mistake National is simply not giving MSD the resources it needs to undertake the services it provides to the public. Fewer staff are being asked to do more work. This puts unacceptable pressure on them, and it is ordinary New Zealanders who will suffer from a reduction in services.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that National are all talk and no action when it comes to keeping Kiwis working. John Key continues his party’s PR spin on moving resources from the backroom to the frontline.</p>
<p>“It’s time the Government stopped promoting meaningless slogans and started promoting kiwi jobs.</p>
<p>“Any positions created on the frontline are because of the increased demand caused by an increase of 24,000 people who are no longer in work, not because of any redeployment of resources.</p>
<p>“I am personally appalled that Minister of Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett isn’t taking responsibility for these job losses.</p>

<p>“Her statement that the Chief Executive would announce details of the redundancies shows she doesn’t have the courage to stand up publicly when she has signed off on the dismissal of 200 staff members. That is shameful.</p>
<p>So far the Government has cut more than 1000 jobs from the Tertiary Education Commission, Ministry for Environment, Ministry of Health, National Library, State Services Commission, Ministry of Social Development, Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Fisheries.</p>
<p>“The National Party boast about the 117 jobs saved by the nine day fortnight yet, that have cut nearly 10 times that number of jobs from Government Departments.</p>
<p>“All New Zealanders will suffer from such short-sighted policies ,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
