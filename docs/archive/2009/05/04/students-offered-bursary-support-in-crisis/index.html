<p><strong>Monday, 4 May 2009, 2:12 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University">Massey University</a></strong></p>
<p>Monday, May 4, 2009<br>Students offered bursary support in economic crisis</p>
<p>New Zealanders hit by the world financial crisis are eligible for 50 new $1000 study bursaries established by the University to enable them to enrol in the second semester and improve their employability by up-skilling.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says anyone whose employment has been effected by economic downturn – or is likely to be – may apply when they enrol or immediately if they are a current student, either internal or extramural.</p>
<p>&quot;We felt it was important to recognise that many people are either having to review their career paths or face uncertainty,&quot; Mr Maharey says. &quot;We wanted also to provide an incentive to people to grow their knowledge and their skill set and use, what will inevitably be a temporary downturn in employment prospects, as an opportunity to ensure they are better placed to take advantage when the climate improves.&quot;</p>
<p>Applications for the bursaries close on June 15. All applicants must be either New Zealand citizens or permanent residents, enrolling extramurally or internally in full or part-time study and must show a willingness to complete their intended programme of study.</p>
<p>Courses offered for semester two, which begins on July 13, include undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in the arts, health sciences, business, biological sport and exercise science and computing.</p>
<p>Applications forms can be obtained from the University website (<a href="http://www.massey.ac.nz">www.massey.ac.nz</a>) or by phoning the 0800-627-739.</p>
