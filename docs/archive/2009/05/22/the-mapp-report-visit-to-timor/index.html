<p>VISIT TO TIMOR-LESTE</p>
<p>Last week I visited Defence Force personnel deployed in Timor-Leste. I went to several patrol bases around Dili, the capital and joined a Kiwi section one evening as they patrolled the streets. The professionalism of our men and women in uniform is amazing. I was able to get a good understanding of what their tasks are and how they respond to the challenges they face. They are doing an outstanding job and it was clear that they are highly respected by both their ISF colleagues and the people of Timor-Leste.</p>
<p>During the visit I presented the Timor-Leste Solidarity Medal to the servicemen and women on deployment. This is a medal of the Timor-Leste Government and shows their appreciation of the work New Zealand has done to restore stability and hope to the people of Timor.</p>
<p>DEFENCE REVIEW 09 On Wednesday I went to Massey University&#39;s Manawatu campus, to tour the Centre for Defence Studies. It was an excellent opportunity to explain the background to Defence Review 09 and canvass some of the major issues around New Zealand&#39;s defence and security needs in the next few decades. If you would like to know more, the speech can be found on my page on the Beehive website, <a href="http://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/why+defence+review+0">http://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/why+defence+review+0</a></p>
<p>TAKAPUNA 2020</p>
<p>This week Alison Roe and Guy Haddleton launched Takapuna 2020. They are seeking to galvanise people to take charge of the development of your city.</p>

<p>Takapuna is blessed with the greatest urban beach in the country, but a connection between the beach and the city has never been successfully forged. The creation of local boards will provide the people of Takapuna with a strong voice in the region and provide a focal point for local residents and businesses.</p>
<p>Like the rest of Auckland, Takapuna is facing a series of opportunities. The introduction of ferry services, the redevelopment of Hurstmere Green and the crafting of a strong connection to the sea can all play a part in the future of our city. These are things that we need to see happen in our city. If you would like to share your thoughts on this with me, please feel free to contact my office.</p>
<p>OUT AND ABOUT</p>
<p>Today I opened the new senior block at Belmont Primary School. This project transforms what was an outdated 1940s block into a modern, high-tech learning facility.</p>
<p>The introduction of smart boards to the classrooms has excited the students and made for a more stimulating learning environment.</p>
<p>This project is a welcome investment in the next generation.</p>
