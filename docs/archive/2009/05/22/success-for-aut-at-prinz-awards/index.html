<p>Success For AUT At Prinz Awards</p>
<p>22 May 2009</p>
<p>AUT University students were in several winning teams at the Public Relations Institute of New Zealand’s national awards on 20 May 2009.</p>
<p>AUT students won the Tertiary Student Project Award with their “OneForTheGirls” HPV Immunisation Campaign. Members of the team were: Daniel Waugh, Mary-Louise Dare, Matt Vogts, Emma Voerman, Claire Lancaster and Rebecca Gillespie.</p>
<p>“We are delighted for the students, their work was of a high professional standard,” said curriculum leader, Joseph Peart. “It is one of numerous highly-effective projects completed each year by the students’ pro-bono agency ‘Outside the Square’.”</p>
<p>A key aspect of the student-run campaign was their use of social media, which has become a major initiative in the university’s public relations curriculum and a research emphasis in the field of communication management.</p>
<p>AUT Public Relations alumni were represented in winning teams in eight of the eleven award categories. Megan Hopkins-Stone became the sixth AUT graduate in seven years to win the Sally Logan-Milne Young Practitioner of the Year Award.</p>
<p>The Supreme Award was won by long-time AUT sponsor, Network PR, and in the winning team was Silke Marsh, an AUT alumna.</p>
<p>AUT alumni in winning and highly commended teams were: Kristie Penwarden, Aleisha Coote, Simon Clark, Silke Marsh, and Holly McClune.</p>
