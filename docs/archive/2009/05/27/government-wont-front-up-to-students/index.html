<p>Government won’t front up to students</p>
<p>Student leaders today are questioning the Government’s commitment to tertiary education and supporting learners after Government Ministers have again declined to speak to student leaders and representatives.</p>
<p>The Minister of Tertiary Education, Hon Anne Tolley, and the Associate Minister of Tertiary Education, Hon Dr Wayne Mapp, were invited to speak at the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations’ January conference and the upcoming July conference, but won’t be attending. For the past decade, a representative from the Government has regularly fronted up to students in these forums.</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and learners and holds three conferences a year that bring together student executives around the country to discuss student concerns, facilitate networking, training, campaigning and information sharing.</p>
<p>“This would have been the perfect and logical opportunity for the Government to talk directly to student representatives and engage with learners,” said Sophia Blair, Co-President of NZUSA. “Conference delegates were looking forward to engaging constructively with the new National Government and providing a forum to speak to student leaders and address their concerns”, said Blair.</p>
<p>“Given the Budget is widely predicted to be disappointing for students, and we’re facing rising student unemployment, a threat to quality in tertiary education and the possibility of substantial fees rises, students will rightly want answers from the Government regarding these issues,” said Blair</p>
<p>“It’s important that the Government reconsider its decision not to attend and fronts up to explain its direction and priorities for tertiary education and the implications for learners,” concluded Blair.</p>
