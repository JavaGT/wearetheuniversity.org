<p>Parekura Horomia<br>Maori Affairs spokesperson</p>
<p>7 May 2009 Media Statement<br>More than one in 10 Maori now unemployed</p>
<p>Unemployment rates for Maori have jumped to 11.9 percent up from 9.8 percent according the Household Labour Force Survey Labour Maori Affairs spokesperson Parekura Horomia says.</p>
<p>“Those figures represent thousands more Maori struggling to support their families and make ends meet.</p>
<p>“More than one in 10 Maori are now unemployed, yet today we have heard nothing from Maori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples about how he intends to turn this around.</p>
<p>“The Minister clearly has no plan to help Maori people who are suffering in increasing numbers from the effects of this recession.</p>
<p>“Rather than worrying about whether to travel to Fiji the Minister needs to have job retention and creation as his number priority.<br>“People are genuinely suffering and need to see strong leadership and clear direction from their Government. Unfortunately they are not getting either.<br>“National and the Maori Party are not doing enough to protect Kiwi jobs,” Parekura Horomia said.</p>
