<p>28 April 2009<br>Media Statement</p>
<p>National votes down $15 minimum wage</p>
<p>Labour MP Darien Fenton’s Minimum Wage and Remuneration Bill was voted down by the National/Act Government in Parliament last night.</p>
<p>The Bill would have brought minimum wage rights to thousands of contractors who are currently without protection because their employment status excludes them from the Minimum Wage Act.</p>
<p>It would also have increased the minimum wage for all workers to $13.00 on 1 July this year, $14.00 on 2 July 2010 and $15.00 in 2011.</p>
<p>“This shows that National has no commitment to the lowest paid workers at a time when we need to be looking out for those most in need in these tough times,” said Ms Fenton.</p>
<p>“It is an opportunity missed and as a result of last night’s vote, contractors will continue to be open to exploitation and paid as little as $4 an hour.</p>
<p>Darien Fenton said she also sought an amendment that would require political parties to sign up to the Minimum Wage Act as a way of demonstrating their commitment to this most basic of rights.</p>
<p>“The National/Act government voted against this as well.”</p>
