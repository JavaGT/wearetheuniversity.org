<p>Otago University Divisions Compete for Honours</p>
<p>Who can debate better than a Law student? Is there a bigger jock on campus than a PE student? Who is craftier than an Arts student?</p>
<p>The Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) doesn’t know – but with the inaugural inter-course sports tournament we aim to find out!</p>
<p>On Sunday 31st May courses within all Divisions of the University are representing their course in Touch, Netball, Soccer, Petanque and Debating in an epic battle.</p>
<p>The show down takes place at Logan Park from 2-4:30pm.</p>
<p>Courses represented are: Law, Commerce, Arts, Science, 1st year Health Sci and 2nd year + Health sci (i.e. Med, Physio, Pharmacy) students.</p>
<p>“It is a great chance for students to engage in some healthy competition and physical activity before getting into exams. It is especially good for those students no longer in colleges of residence, as colleges are usually the only ones that get to be involved in this type of activity” said organiser Harriet Geoghegan, the OUSA Commerce Rep.</p>
<p>As well as ‘bragging rights’ and the Loaded Goblin Shield, competitors can win spot and other prizes donated by local businesses. There is a free BBQ and Prize Giving after the event.</p>
<p>“People are invited to come down to Logan Park to cheer on their Divisions” said Harriet, “If you’re a graduate living locally, you are welcome to come along and support your Division too!”</p>
