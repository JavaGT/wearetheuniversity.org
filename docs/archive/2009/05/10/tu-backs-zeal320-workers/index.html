<p>CTU backs Zeal320 workers</p>
<p>The Council of Trade Unions has added its voice to the chorus of support for the Zeal320 flight crew and the EPMU in their dispute with Air New Zealand.</p>
<p>CTU Secretary Peter Conway said: “Air New Zealand has no defence in this case. It is quite clear that Zeal320 crew are being paid thousands of dollars less than Air New Zealand staff for doing the same work. Air New Zealand has been misleading in its claims about the nature of the parity that the Zeal320 workers are seeking. They need to come clean and address the basic fairness at issue here.”</p>
<p>“After months of negotiations the true picture of who is being unreasonable is finally emerging, and it is not the EPMU. This is not simply a case of bargaining for a decent wage from a profitable employer, but a matter of fundamental decency in how employees are treated. Zeal320 staff are Air New Zealand employees in all but name and deserve the same terms and conditions for the job that they do.”</p>
<p>Peter Conway said: “The union movement is supporting the Zeal320 workers. We have also talked with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. We want to see talks resume between the EPMU and Air New Zealand and a satisfactory settlement reached soon. However if the dispute escalates, the union movement will come in behind these workers”.</p>
