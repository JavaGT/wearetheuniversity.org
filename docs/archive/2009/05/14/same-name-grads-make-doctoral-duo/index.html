<p>Same name grads make doctoral duo</p>
<p>Angela Jury graduated today with a PhD from Massey University – and so did Angela Jury.</p>
<p>The two women - with exactly the same first and last names - stepped up to receive their doctoral degrees one after the other at the College of Humanities and Social Sciences’ ceremony in Palmerston North. Wearing identical academic gowns and caps, their identities distinguished only by their different middle names and academic disciplines.</p>
<p>Angela Faye Jury came on stage first to receive her PhD in Psychology, followed by Angela Jean Jury, with a PhD in Sociology.</p>
<p>Having the same name has created confusion for the pair over the past few years while they have been enrolled at Massey, even though they never met until this week.</p>
<p>“I have received numerous interloans from the library for her over the years that our time at Massey coincided, along with having issues with doctors’ appointments, course approvals, student allowances and so on, “ says Angela Jean. “Indeed any chance to get us confused seemed to happen, but somehow our paths never crossed in person.”</p>
<p>Graduation officials and gown hire staff this week had to ask; “which Angela Jury are you?” or “so you’re the other one?” In the end, they opted for Ang, as Angela Jean likes to be called, and Angela for Angela Faye.</p>
<p>The women are not related. Angela Faye is from Auckland and has been a Jury from birth, whereas Angela Jean, originally from Waitara, acquired the name Jury through marriage.</p>

<p>Angela Faye Jury’s psychology thesis explored behavioural issues surrounding New Zealand men’s low intake of fruit and vegetables, and looked at factors influencing a change in this behaviour. Her study was prompted by her concern regarding the link between poor diet and the rate of chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes.</p>
<p>Angela Jean Jury’s sociology thesis drew on the accounts of 25 survivors of intimate partner abuse to explore a specific form of social bonding that begins with the erosion of a sense of self on the part of the victim and develops into paralysing shame. She says her study has major implications for the way agencies – from the police force to women’s refuge workers – deal with abuse victims.</p>
<p>The pair was among eight PhDs to graduate today. A total of 13,120 students, including 31 PhDs, have graduated this week.</p>
