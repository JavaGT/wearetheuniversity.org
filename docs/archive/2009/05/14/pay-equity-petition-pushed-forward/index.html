<p>Pay Equity Petition Pushed Forward</p>
<p>The National Government’s total disregard for the issue of pay equity will continue unless people stand up and ensure National can’t sweep it under the carpet, Labour Women’s Affairs spokesperson Sue Moroney says.</p>
<p>Sue Moroney is circulating a petition on Pay Equity that must be returned to her by September 1.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister says the Government has &#39;reprioritised&#39; and I guess we all now know that women come down the bottom of National&#39;s list of priorities.</p>
<p>&quot;The message from this Government is clear - women and their families just don&#39;t rate.&quot;</p>
<p>Sue Moroney launched her petition earlier this year, after the Government stopped two pay equity investigations that were being conducted for school support staff and social workers.</p>
<p>“The petition calls on the Government to reinstate these two pay equity investigations; to honour the implementation of completed pay investigations and to develop a strategy to eliminate the gender pay gap.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday&#39;s announcement adversely affects thousands of hard-working women, many of whom this Government claims to support as frontline staff,&quot; says Sue Moroney.</p>
<p>&quot;The issues and practices causing the gender pay gap are complex and detailed. The Pay and Employment Equity Unit was at the forefront of unravelling the barriers to fairness for women at work. That work has been stopped in its tracks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I call on all men and women who believe in a fair go to step up the pressure on this Government by joining the thousands of people who have signed the petition,” Sue Moroney said.</p>
