<p><strong>Scientists explore new frontiers of gene behaviour</strong></p>

<p>Two molecular biologists are exploring the next frontier of cellular space in a bid to understand what makes healthy cells turn bad.</p>
<p>Dr Justin O’Sullivan and Dr Austen Ganley, from the Institute of Natural Sciences at Albany, will gain a pioneering glimpse into the nano-scale labyrinth of chromosomal linkages within cells when they analyse 20 billion DNA sequence bases.</p>
<p>They have been able to embark on the research having recently won second prize in an international science competition giving them access to the latest sequencing technology known as SOLiD 3 System, developed by United States research company Applied Biosystems and located at Otago University.</p>
<p>The machine uses a strategy called sequencing by ligation, which will provide data for 20 billion bases of DNA sequence, revealing the intricate three-dimensional web of connections within a cell.</p>
<p>Dr O’Sullivan and Dr Ganley are applying the technology in a way that has not been done before to observe the complex architecture of genomes for insights into the formation of diseased cells.</p>
<p>The prize will enable them to advance their existing research in a bid to understand the complex chromosomal interactions that occur between genes and get closer to understanding how diseases such as cancer develop.</p>
<p>“The idea is that physical interactions between genes control whether these genes are switched on or off,&quot; Dr O&#39;Sullivan says. &quot;This technology will enable us to identify novel interactions and the genes they control.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr Ganley says it will give them the ability to see how organisms evolve and function and &quot;some of the linkages may be related to diseases&quot;.</p>
<p>They are sending samples of yeast cells to Otago University where the sequencing technology is based and expect to receive data back in July, which they will analyse for several months.</p>
<p>The pair entered a competition late last year when they saw it advertised in the eminent science journal <em>Nature.</em> The international competition sought novel applications for the new sequencing system to advance the study of genetic science in ways that could have an impact on human health. First prize went to medical researchers at St Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Tennessee.  </p>
