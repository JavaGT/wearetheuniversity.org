<p><strong>Monday, 18 May 2009, 1:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University_Students'_Association_Federation">Massey University Students&#39; Association Federation</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Massey University students concerned for the future of tertiary education in New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>The Massey University Students’ Associations Federation (MUSAF) are appalled by the recent announcement made by the Minister of Finance, Bill English, on behalf of the National Party regarding the party’s refusal to continue to increase funding to the tertiary sector.</p>
<p>The Federation, who represent approximately 45,000 students from seven individual student bodies, are deeply concerned as to what the repercussions will be for students who are already engaging in tertiary education and what measures the University itself will have to take in order to alleviate the pressures bought about by not adjusting tertiary funding to current CPI levels.</p>
<p>“In this current wintry economic climate, students, just like the vast majority of other people, are suffering great hardship. The recession has meant that more and more people are returning to tertiary education and a lack of funding in this sector could truly jeopardise the quality of education in New Zealand”said President of the Albany Students’ Association, Rawa Karetai.</p>
<p>Given that the Australian Government have recently increased their tertiary education budget by A$2.6million billion, the National Party’s apparent disinterest in one of the most influential sectors comes as a great surprise to MUSAF.</p>
<p>“Putting money towards education is a great way of investing in both our society’s future and New Zealand’s infrastructure. Hopefully, the Government will reconsider the value of tertiary education as they start to finalise the budget”concluded Karetai.</p>
