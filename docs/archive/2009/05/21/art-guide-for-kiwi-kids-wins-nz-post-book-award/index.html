<p><strong>Auckland University Press</strong><br><strong>Media release</strong><br><strong>For Immediate Release</strong></p>
<p><strong>Art Guide for Kiwi Kids Wins NZ Post Book Award For Non-Fiction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Back &amp; Beyond: New Zealand Painting for the Young and Curious</strong> by <strong>Gregory O’Brien</strong>, published by <strong>Auckland University Press</strong>, last night won the 2009 <strong>Non-Fiction Prize</strong> at the <strong>New Zealand Post Book Awards for Children and Young Adults</strong>.</p>
<p>Describing <strong>Back &amp; Beyond</strong> as a fascinating journey through New Zealand’s history and culture, the Judges’ Report says, “It challenges preconceptions about the nature of our art and its place in our world, and encourages readers to think about the way they respond to art.”</p>
<p>Auckland University Press Director Sam Elworthy says the Press is very lucky to work with one of New Zealand’s great creative omnivores in author Greg O’Brien.</p>
<p>“We are delighted that Greg’s achievement in <strong>Back &amp; Beyond</strong> has been recognised and the book has won the Non-Fiction prize at this year’s New Zealand Post Book Awards.”</p>
<p><strong>Back &amp; Beyond</strong> was selected as the Non-Fiction Category winner from five finalist books published in New Zealand in 2008.</p>
<p>“The five titles chosen as the finalists provide inspiration, revelation, information and entertainment on widely disparate topics,” noted the Judges.</p>
<p>“They all have the capacity to change the inner landscape of their readers, to start them thinking in new directions, even to inspire journeys of their own.”</p>
<p>Gregory O’Brien, a graduate of The University of Auckland, is a past New Zealand Post Book Award winner. His <em>Welcome to the South Seas: Contemporary New Zealand Art for Young People</em> (Auckland University Press, 2004) took out top honours for Non-Fiction in 2005, won the 2005 LIANZA Elsie Locke Award and was a finalist in the Spectrum Print Design Awards.</p>
