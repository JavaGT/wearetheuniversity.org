<p>Media in the frontline at Reporting Wars conference</p>
<p>Massey staff will have a prominent role at an international conference war reporting hosted by the University in Wellington tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reporting Wars: Challenges and Responsibilities brings together the combined skills and experience of local and international journalists as well as humanitarian law specialists and military staff from the Defence Force to discuss issues ranging from the safety and protection of journalists reporting from conflict zones to relationships between the military and the news media and an examination of international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>The School of Communication, Journalism and Marketing is hosting the conference, which has been organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross and New Zealand Red Cross.</p>
<p>Massey communication and journalism departmental staff Margie Comrie, Alan Samson (pictured), Cathy Strong and James Hollings will chair panel discussions. Among the panellists are Reuter’s global editor Chris Cramer from New York and International Red Cross spokesman Florian Westphal from Geneva.</p>
<p>New Zealand journalists include Cameron Bennett and Barbara Dreaver from TVNZ, freelancer Jon Stephenson, Brent Edwards from Radio New Zealand and Michael Field from Fairfax.</p>
<p>The conference is open to the public but aimed at journalists, non-government organisations and those interested in humanitarian law. As space is limited, registration is essential in the Red Cross website: website <a href="http://www.redcross.org.nz">www.redcross.org.nz</a></p>
