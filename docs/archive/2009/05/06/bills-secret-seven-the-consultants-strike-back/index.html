<p>6 May 2009 Media Statement</p>
<p>Bill&#39;s secret seven: The consultants strike back</p>
<p>Public servants facing the prospect of widespread job cuts will be dismayed to see consultants being paid $1500 a day to do Bill English&#39;s dirty work, Grant Robertson Labour State Services Spokesperson says.</p>
<p>&quot;Like a bad movie sequel, National has brought back highly paid consultants, just as they are cutting jobs. It is the 1990s all over again,&quot; Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>“Since National has been in office more than a thousand public servants have lost their jobs all in the name of cost cutting. At the same time National has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to consultants to cut even more funding.</p>
<p>“What are public servants to make of this approach? Bill English&#39;s secret seven advisors have been foisted on Ministers and Departments to make the budget for Ministerial Services look smaller.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear that a small group of consultants are doing Bill English’s dirty work.</p>
<p>&quot;Doug Martin was tasked with scoping the role of purchase advisors, and promptly his business partner, Kevin Jenkins, is employed as one.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition to their role as purchase advisors, Murray Horn and Graham Scott have been appointed by the Government to a Ministerial taskforce to implement their agenda in health and regulatory changes.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly National&#39;s agenda of governing in the interests of the few rather that the many is now clear,&quot; Grant Robertson said.</p>
