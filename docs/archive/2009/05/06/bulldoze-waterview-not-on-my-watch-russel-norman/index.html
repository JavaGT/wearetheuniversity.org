<p>Bulldoze Waterview? Not on my watch: Russel Norman</p>
<p>Green Party Co-Leader Dr Russel Norman is the first Mt Albert candidate to accept an invitation to debate the electorate’s transport issues.</p>
<p>Dr Norman will take part in next week’s candidates debate at Unitec, organised by Eden Albert Community Board chair Christopher Dempsey.</p>
<p>“I challenge the other candidates to front up and discuss their party’s plans for a motorway through Mt Albert and Waterview,” Dr Norman said. “Labour’s tunnel is dumb, while National’s aboveground motorway is even dumber.</p>
<p>“Both these options would decimate the Waterview School community. Fresh thinking is needed. The Green Party’s approach is to instead invest the motorway money into public transport.”</p>
<p>Dr Norman asked Parliamentary questions in the House today about the National Government’s plans to ram a motorway through low income neighbourhoods in the Mt Albert electorate.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t satisfied with Transport Minister Stephen Joyce’s answers, so I intend to continue asking tough questions. To the people of Waterview, Avondale, New Windsor and Mt Albert, I say: ‘Not on my watch.’ I will represent them in Parliament and demand answers about this motorway project that is set to ride roughshod over their neighbourhoods.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, Dr Norman heard the concerns of Waterview residents first hand, while doorknocking the suburb. And yesterday Dr Norman and fellow Green MP Keith Locke were briefed by Waterview School principal Brett Skeen about the impacts on the wider school community.</p>

<p>Mr Skeen showed maps of the planned construction zones, then took the pair on a guided tour of Waterview School. He is worried about heavy construction work over many years, the effects of vibrations and air pollution, plus the need to relocate classrooms and playgrounds.</p>
<p>Waterview would probably lose its school pool and some of its valuable greenspace - including an entire sportsfield - so roading contractors could have access to the site. Nearby Waterview Park would also lose some of its sportsgrounds.</p>
<p>Dr Norman said his meeting with Mr Skeen reinforced what he learned from his weekend doorknocking - that residents fear the impacts of a major motorway they neither want nor need.</p>
<p>“Talk about standing up for the little people. This 1950s-style motorway project spells fear and uncertainty for this tightly-knit community. I’m not surprised pupils from a decile two school in a low income neighbourhood may be affected by this motorway project, but can’t imagine Kings College pupils facing the same dilemma…</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to the chance to debate transport issues with the other Mt Albert electorate candidates at Unitec next Wednesday evening.&quot;</p>
