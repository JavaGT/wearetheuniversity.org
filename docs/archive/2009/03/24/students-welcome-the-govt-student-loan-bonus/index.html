<p>Media Release<br>24 March 2009</p>
<p>Students&#39; Association is wrong – Students welcome the Government Student Loan Bonus</p>
<p>This week National’s popular student loan policy promised during the 2008 Election Campaign was delivered on, and included additional inclusion of students living overseas.</p>
<p>From 1 April students will receive a bonus; voluntary repayments over $500 will receive an extra 10 per cent write off from the government.</p>
<p>NZUSA have come out lambasting the policy, despite overwhelming support from students across the country.</p>
<p>As the supposed united national voice for students, NZUSA is critical of the announcement when in fact it has been welcomed across the board.</p>
<p>&quot;NZUSA as an organisation continues to show their complete disregard for the actual opinions of the students it claims to represent&quot; says Young Nats President Alex Mitchell.</p>
<p>&quot;This fresh approach by the National-led government puts incentives in the right place. Shorter repayment times will mean graduates with student loans will be debt-free earlier.</p>
<p>“These comments from NZUSA are typical of an organisation where the diverse views of students play a secondary role to the personal political opinions of the officeholders.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only are students forced to be members of the organisation, but views not necessarily their own are published in their name without consultation.</p>
<p>&quot;Here is a policy based on sound principles that helps to address the serious issue of debt repayment – and typically the reaction from NZUSA is negative.</p>
<p>&quot;It is essential that NZUSA support all policy that assists students, and for once puts ideology to the side”</p>
