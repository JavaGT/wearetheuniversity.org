<p>Tuesday, March 10, 2009<br>No real impact expected from CRI-university merger</p>
<p>The proposed merger between Lincoln University and AgResearch is not likely to impact on Massey, says Massey University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey.</p>
<p>“We see it as an interesting development. However we are already established as being a world-class teaching and research university focused on New Zealand’s vital primary industries. Massey welcomes the merger’s implied acknowledgment of the importance of what we already do.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to see the Government’s continuing interest in the agri-food area and will be closely watching the details of the merger as they come out. We also welcome the opportunity to engage with crown research institutes in a different manner, as illustrated by this process.”</p>
<p>Massey has more than 3000 staff and 36,000 students, total annual revenue of more than $350 million, and assets valued in excess of $1 billion. Four hundred staff and postgraduates work directly in support of agri-business, from best practice in pastoral livestock to cutting edge food product design and development. This focused expertise is comprehensively supported by the University’s staff in closely-related areas that underpin the agricultural value chain including the fundamental sciences, process engineering, food and nutrition, environmental science, the social sciences, design, and business.</p>
<p>Modern infrastructure at Massey includes a $25 million food development complex, and the Government-funded centre of research excellence the Riddet Institute. Physical resources unmatched in Australasia include 2000ha of farms, the majority located adjacent to the Manawatu campus and others enabling specialist research, such as the dry lands facility, Riverside farm in Masterton.</p>

<p>“Massey has powered the engine-room of New Zealand’s land based economy for more than 80 years,” Mr Maharey says. Our foresight, innovation and national and international networks are needed more than ever by the agri-food sector and we would welcome further Government investment in and development of the sector.”</p>
<p>Massey University has recently introduced a range of new agricultural programmes including the Bachelor of Agriscience, Bachelor of AgriCommerce and Bachelor of Environmental Sciences and enrolments in agriculture-related courses at Massey University are around 15 per cent up in semester one.</p>
