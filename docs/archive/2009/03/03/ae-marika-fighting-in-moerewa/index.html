<p><strong>FIGHTING IN MOEREWA</strong></p>
<p>On Saturday night, about a thousand others and myself turned up to a fight-night down Moerewa run by JJ Hepi and his Kaikohe based ETK kick-boxing club, and hosting clubs and fighters from Kaitaia, Kerikeri, Hokianga, Whangarei and South Auckland.</p>
<p>There were about 10 fights on the night and every one of them was a boomer. In the final bout, the star attraction, NZ Superheavyweight K1 champion Hiriwa Te Rangi, originally from Pakotai, but fighting now out of Invercargill, won a TKO decision over Kaitaia-based Razorblade Jason Reti.</p>
<p>The event was originally planned for Kaikohe but it seems that somebody didn’t want it to go ahead, forcing the organisers to shift it to Parawhenua and then to Moerewa on the day itself.</p>
<p>I’ll probably cop some flak for saying this, but in a place where the flashest buildings are the police station, the courthouse, the social welfare, the PD centre and the jail, you’d think that those with the power to help relieve the depressing and destructive impact of high unemployment would get alongside people like JJ and support activities like this.</p>
<p>JJ and his crew are taking the fights off the streets and putting them back in the ring, and teaching discipline, skills, fitness and a good attitude. Sure - JJ ain’t no angel but then who is? And yes, there were heaps of gangsters in attendance but most of the crowd were salt of the earth types from all over the north out for a good night, and everyone enjoyed themselves.</p>

<p>The fight night was a great success for the hundreds in attendance and a spit in the eye for the dull brigade who tried to stop it. Hopefully next time, the authorities will open their other eye when considering the application.</p>
<p>Congratulations JJ. You did your club, your sport and your community proud.</p>
<p><strong>NO FIGHTING IN MURIWHENUA</strong></p>
<p>In a wonderful example of inter-tribal unity, last week the five tribes of Te Hiku spent a very polite couple of hours with the Treaty Settlements Minister Chris Finlayson, talking about the importance of an early settlement for iwi and for the region.</p>
<p>The Minister made a very positive statement about Te Hiku being one of his top priorities, and I added my 10 cents worth by saying I hoped that people could see that “the quantity of the settlement was not as important as the quality of the unity which comes from the iwi working together.”</p>
<p>And yes, I know that this hui was more important but the kick-boxing was way more fun!</p>
