<p>“Greg O’Brien blows a breeze of fresh air through the world of New Zealand painting in Back &amp; Beyond to create a book that everyone from 10-year-old kids to 80-year-old artists rave to me about. And with good reason. The book is overflowing with intriguing ideas and arresting images about art and life in Aotearoa,” said Auckland University Press Director Sam Elworthy.</p>
<p>“Auckland University Press is very lucky to work with one of New Zealand’s great creative omnivores in author Greg O’Brien and we’re thrilled that Back and Beyond has been named a finalist in the New Zealand Post Book Awards.”</p>

All winners will be announced at an awards ceremony held at Auckland Museum on Wednesday 20 May. Finalists will be participating in children’s book events around the country as part of a nationwide celebration of the New Zealand Post Book Awards. The festivities begin on Monday 11 May and continue through to Wednesday 20 May.</p>
