<p><strong>Monday, 30 March 2009, 5:24 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology">Auckland University of Technology</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>100 entrepreneurs, 100 ideas: Entrepreneurial Summit - April 24</strong></p>
<p>Entrepreneurial Summit coordinator Tony Falkenstein has been overwhelmed with interest to participate in a brainstorm of New Zealand&#39;s best entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Just Water International CEO Falkenstein says after announcing the summit on Friday, he received emails and phone calls from 43 of the country&#39;s most successful business leaders from as far afield as the UK asking to participate.</p>
<p>The Entrepreneurial Summit team is sending an invitation for expressions of interest to more than 200 entrepreneurs today. The invitees include well known Kiwi entrepreneurs Peter Jackson, Graham Hart, Karen Walker, Peri Drysdale, Annah Stretton, Michael Hill, Peter Leitch and AUT alumnus Stephen Tindall.</p>
<p>This group will be whittled down to 100 people who will attend on Friday, April 24.</p>
<p>&quot;Entry to the summit is going to be competitive,&quot; says Falkenstein. &quot;The bar is set very high. To receive an official invitation to join the top 100, each interested entrepreneur must send us their best idea summarised to 300 words by April 7.</p>
<p>&quot;Only ideas that leverage the opportunities for the whole of New Zealand or create a competitive economy for future entrepreneurs will be accepted,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>The event is being sponsored by the AUT Venture Fund, a fund launched last week to support AUT student and alumni entrepreneurial endeavour. The Venture Fund enables AUT entrepreneurs to present start-up business plans to a board of academic and business leaders, which will grant funds based on business merit and long-term contribution to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Falkenstein says the AUT Venture Fund is just one example of an idea that will secure New Zealand&#39;s future as a global business leader by growing our own.</p>
<p>He adds that if Kiwi entrepreneurs are anything like him they&#39;ll struggle to limit themselves to one idea. But only the best will do.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re looking for ideas that are original, simple and can be actioned immediately,&quot; adds Falkenstein. &quot;So while some ideas might be brilliant, the Entrepreneurial Summit board may decide that others are just a little more brilliant to make the cut.&quot;</p>
<p>Every attendee will be given the opportunity to present their best idea to their peers in a strictly monitored five minute presentation. From 100 ideas, the top 20 will be chosen and presented to Prime Minister John Key.</p>
<p>The top 100 summit participants&#39; names will be posted on the website <a href="http://www.entrepreneurialsummit.co.nz">www.entrepreneurialsummit.co.nz</a> once the final group is selected.</p>
