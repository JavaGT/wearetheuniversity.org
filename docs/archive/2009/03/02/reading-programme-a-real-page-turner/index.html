<p>Helping people improve their reading skills can also boost their self-esteem and motivation to learn, says literacy specialist Professor Tom Nicholson.</p>
<p>Professor Nicholson’s after-school reading tuition programme has recently resumed at the Albany campus with an expanded team of specially-trained Massey students helping school pupils aged between seven and 15 with reading speed and accuracy.</p>
<p>Professor Nicholson, who directs the Centre of Excellence for Research on Children&#39;s Literacy, believes literacy is the foundation for success in school, as well as for building self-esteem and the motivation to do well. Conversely, those who struggle with reading can struggle socially as well as academically. “Once young readers fall behind, there is a 90 per cent chance they will not catch up,” he says.</p>
<p>The reading programme, run since 2001, is designed to cater to individual needs and works to overcome counter-productive strategies some children develop. It aims to get every pupil reading fluently above their age level.</p>
<p>Wendy Mauer, of Manukau, enrolled her 10-year-old daughter, Sarah, in the programme last year and says in two terms of tuition she went from a reading level of an eight-year-old that of an 11-year-old. “It helped amazingly,” Ms Mauer says. “I can’t believe the progress Sarah made. I absolutely recommend it.”</p>
<p>The programme, run in the School of Education at the Albany campus, consists of hour-long, one-on-one lessons encompassing phonics, reading common words, spelling and comprehension strategies. Each student is also given a homework book with writing and reading exercises.</p>

<p>Training extra tutors this year to meet the demand for reading assistance is evidence of Professor Nicholson’s passion for preventing struggling young readers from falling through the cracks. “The secret is to find out exactly where the problem lies, set out a plan with goals and objectives and check their progress regularly. We want to give them a dream that they can succeed and that somebody cares about them, wants them to do well and knows how to help,” he says.</p>
<p>Parents are asked make a $20 donation for each lesson, although this can be waived if families cannot afford it.</p>
<p>Places for the programme are limited. The lessons are offered on Fridays between 3.30pm and 5.30pm each school term.</p>
