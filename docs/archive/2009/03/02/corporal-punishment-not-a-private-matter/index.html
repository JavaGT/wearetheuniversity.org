<p>Corporal Punishment not a Private Matter</p>
<p>The Green Party is concerned by the findings of a Law Commission report<br>which suggests private schools are unchallenged over use of corporal<br>punishment.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems bizarre that private schools can be considered above the law<br>of the land, especially when they get $40 million of state funding a<br>year and are expected to meet modern standards in all other ways,&quot; Green<br>Party Education Spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is even more illogical - given the changes to section 59 of the<br>Crimes Act - that any school would be able to act inconsistently with<br>the ban on corporal punishment.&quot;</p>
<p>Law Commission President Sir Geoffrey Palmer&#39;s foreword to the Private<br>Schools And The Law report shows private schools inhabit a grey area<br>legally and regulation has never had systematic attention.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 students attend New Zealand&#39;s 99 private schools and<br>they deserve the full protection of the law, Ms Delahunty said.</p>
<p>Non violence needed to be upheld in all homes and all schools and<br>regulations protecting all children applied across the board: &quot;Private<br>schools can teach from their own philosophical perspective but we<br>believe the Ministry of Education has a duty to ensure all schools<br>receiving any level of state funding are safe and free from violence<br>against children.&quot;</p>
