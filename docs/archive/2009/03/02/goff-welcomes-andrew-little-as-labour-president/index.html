<p><strong>Monday, 2 March 2009, 2:08 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>

<p>2 March 2009 Media Statement</p>
<p>Goff welcomes Andrew Little as Labour President</p>
<p>Labour Leader Phil Goff today warmly welcomed Andrew Little as the new president of the New Zealand Labour Party.</p>
<p>Mr Little, national secretary of the Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union, was elected unopposed today. He takes over from Mike Williams, who has retired after eight years in the role.</p>
<p>“The election of Andrew Little to the role of party president is a significant step in the renewal process taking place in the Labour Party since the last election.</p>
<p>“I have known Andrew for many years. He is a person of great ability and integrity.</p>
<p>“Andrew is well respected across the community as part of a new generation of Labour movement leaders and he is in touch with ordinary working New Zealanders. He advocates strongly for working people who are his members but he is equally willing to engage with employers and government to address the wider economic challenges facing New Zealand and to find solutions.</p>
<p>“Labour now has new leadership teams in place for both its Parliamentary team and wider party structure, following my taking over as Labour leader in November, and Annette King as new deputy leader.</p>
<p>“Labour also has 13 new MPs, who bring skills and knowledge from a wide range of fields, to complement the huge levels of experience among our existing MPs.</p>
<p>“Andrew and I are committed to working to strengthen the Labour Party organisationally, and to reconnect with the electorate as part of building the foundation for the return of a Labour Government</p>

<p>Moira Coatsworth was elected as Vice President, replacing Marian Hobbs. Moira is a member of the Labour Party Council representing the Waikato and Bay of Plenty electorates. She was a child psychologist for twenty years and has held national roles in the health and disability sector.</p>
<p>Phil Goff paid tribute to outgoing president Mike Williams.</p>
<p>“I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Mike for his many years of service and hard work on behalf of the Labour Party. He made a huge contribution to the election and re-election of the three-term Labour Government.</p>
<p>“His commitment to the Labour cause over many years was exceptional. I wish him well for the future,” Phil Goff said.</p>
