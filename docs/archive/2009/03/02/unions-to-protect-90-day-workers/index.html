<p><strong>Monday, 2 March 2009, 12:53 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions">New Zealand Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p>CTU Media release<br>1 March 2009</p>
<p>Unions to protect ‘90 Day’ workers</p>
<p>Unions will offer assistance to workers unfairly sacked under the new 90 Day Fire at Will law which comes into effect on Sunday 1 March. The CTU today said that since the law won’t protect new workers in small firms they will have to do it.</p>
<p>‘Unions will not stand by and see workers treated unfairly by this unnecessary law,’ said CTU President Helen Kelly. ‘We will offer free advice and assistance to anyone affected by the 90 Day Fire at Will law, whether they are a union member or not.’</p>
<p>A weekend of action around the country will see union members distributing leaflets informing people of their rights and referring them to the freephone helpline 0800 1 UNION (0800 186 466) and the website <a href="http://www.fairness.org.nz">www.fairness.org.nz</a>.</p>
<p>Helen Kelly continued: ‘It is ironic that this law should come into force on the very weekend of the Government’s jobs summit when we are all trying to find ways of keeping New Zealanders in work. The 90 Day Fire at Will law doesn’t make it any easier for small businesses to hire workers, it only makes it easier to fire them.</p>
<p>‘Although the law removes the right of workers to claim unfair dismissal once they have been sacked, there are still things workers can do to minimise their chances of becoming a victim of the new rules. The most important thing they can do is join a union, but if anyone is sacked or threatened with the sack under this legislation we will provide free advice and help, union member or not. Any small business that uses this law can expect to see the union and we will also publicly name and shame those that come to our attention.’</p>
<p>The CTU campaign against the 90 Day Fire at Will law will continue into next week and beyond with advertising on commercial and student radio and other activities to ensure that the public is reminded of this wholly unnecessary attack on employees’ fundamental work rights.</p>
