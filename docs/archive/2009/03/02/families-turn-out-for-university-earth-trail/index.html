<p>Hundreds of Waikato families took part in this month’s Waikato University earth trail.</p>
<p>The Earth, Ocean and Environment Trail from Hamilton to Raglan ran 10.30am-4pm on March 1, giving the public the chance to explore and learn about the region&#39;s environment.</p>
<p>The university&#39;s departments of Earth &amp; Ocean Sciences and Biological Sciences had leading international experts stationed at several sites from Hamilton to Raglan where people could learn about the geological history, coastal processes, and ecology of the region.</p>
<p>Dr Megan Balks, an Earth and Ocean Sciences senior lecturer, says several hundred people took part in the day which aimed to provide a fun and interesting way for families to learn more about their local environment.</p>
<p>She says the boat ride across Te Akau Harbour in a scientific research vessel to examine marine limestones and fossils was particularly popular. Also popular was the chance for people to talk to university staff and students who travel to Antarctica and try on the gear needed to survive in the extreme environment.</p>
<p>Some other activities in the seven stops were a talk in the Hamilton Gardens about the landforms and geological history of Hamilton and the Waikato River, learning how to find the surf-rip at Wainui reserve, walking up the Karioi Volcano or exploring the freshwaters and forests at Bridal Veil Falls.</p>

<p>Dr Balks says this is the second time university experts and students have given freely of their time to share their knowledge with the community. Another trail is likely to be organised in two years.</p>
