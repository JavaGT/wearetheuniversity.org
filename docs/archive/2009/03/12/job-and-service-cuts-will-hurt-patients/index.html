<p><strong>Thursday, 12 March 2009, 3:04 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Job and service cuts will hurt patients          
       </p>
<p>Health service cuts and job losses are happening as a direct result of Health Minister Tony Ryall’s directives that put budgets ahead of patients, Labour Party Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>Tairäwhiti DHB has confirmed in a letter to unions this week that it is cutting staffing numbers by 20 full time positions.</p>
<p>“These jobs cuts come on top of last week’s announcement that West Coast DHB cancelled some elective surgery as a result of a Ministerial directive and that Taranaki is looking at service cuts.</p>
<p>“The Minister promised to cut bureaucracy and increase frontline patient services, but nowhere in its letter to unions does Tairawhiti DHB say these job losses will mean increased services for patients and cancelling elective surgery is certainly not increasing services to West Coast patients.</p>
<p>“Otago DHB is also reviewing its home support services and recently voted to write to the Minister to ensure he knew that financial pressures were coming from clinical cost increases and not because of administration costs.</p>
<p>“Tony Ryall has told the public he can cut bureaucracy and get more services but it is becoming increasingly clear that is simply untrue.</p>
<p>“These short-sighted job and service cuts do nothing for patients and staff morale and will not result in better health outcomes for patients.</p>
<p>“This Minister should be fronting up and explaining why elective surgery is being cancelled on the West Coast because of a directive he gave and why 20 people are losing their jobs in Tairawhiti.</p>
<p>“Under National we are seeing the health sector becoming increasingly stressed and dysfunctional with jobs cuts, service cuts and four DHB chair resignations and sackings,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
