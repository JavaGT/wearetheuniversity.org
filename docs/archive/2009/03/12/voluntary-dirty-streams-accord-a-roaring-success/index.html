<p>Voluntary Dirty Streams Accord a roaring success</p>
<p>The voluntary Clean Streams Accord has failed and it&#39;s time to set enforceable water quality standards, Green Party Co-Leader Russel Norman said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Water quality in New Zealand&#39;s rivers and lakes continues to get worse according to all the scientific evidence.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time for central government to step in with enforceable standards - let&#39;s make our rivers safe for swimming at least. We must stand up to industrial agriculture.</p>
<p>Today the Government released the Clean Streams Accord &#39;Snapshot of Progress 2007/8&#39; report. It shows that 11% of farms continue to flout the law on effluent discharge, in stark contrast to the Accord&#39;s target of full compliance immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;Good farmers deserve better - their bad neighbours must be forced to clean up waterways. We need an even playing-field enforced by a referee, not an unregulated free-for-all.</p>
<p>The Clean Streams Accord, signed in May 2003, aimed to &#39;achieve clean healthy water - including streams, rivers, lakes, groundwater, and wetlands - in dairying areas&#39;, Dr Norman said. However:</p>
<p>* In the Waikato 75% of waterways tested were unsafe for even stock to drink, let alone humans, and 70% were not safe for swimming.</p>
<p>* In Southland damage to the internationally-recognised Waituna Wetland from cow effluent and intensive dairying has required the regional council to employ a special protection officer.</p>
<p>* And in Canterbury, bores and spring-fed lowland streams are drying up as the aquifers are drained by dairy irrigation. Today&#39;s report shows that serious non-compliance has vastly increased in Canterbury from 2% last year, to 20% this year.</p>
<p>Even National MP Nick Smith admitted last year that water quality in New Zealand has declined in the time that the voluntary industry Accord has been in place.</p>
<p>Today the Agriculture Minister David Carter said: &#39;No farmer has the right to pollute.&#39;</p>
<p>Dr Norman responded, &quot;The Accord has made no meaningful improvement to compliance, and Fonterra proposes to weaken the Accord target of 100% compliance, to just an aim of improving non-compliance by 50% by 2011, after eight years of failure.</p>
<p>&quot;Many farmers are really trying to clean up waterways, but their efforts are being undermined by the industrial farmers that just don&#39;t care.</p>
<p>&quot;We owe it to future generations to pass on clean rives and lakes. We will lose our clean and green reputation - valued by Government at $1.5 billion - if we keep polluting our rivers and lakes.</p>
<p>&quot;Our kids deserve to have the joy of swimming in clean streams like we once did&quot;, Dr Norman said.</p>
<p>The Green Party will question the Minister of Agriculture today in Parliament question-time.</p>
