<p>Seminars to gauge disaster response</p>
<p>Australia’s devastating bushfires in Victoria offer a timely insight into how communities cope in the face of disaster a Massey University scientist says ahead of a seminar advising how organisations can prepare for, respond to and recover from a natural, man-made or environmental disaster.</p>
<p>Respected scientists from Australia and the US will be joining New Zealand colleagues on the Wellington campus for the Emergency Management Summer Institute being held from March 16-20 to provide those involved in aspects of disaster management like planners, educators, engineers and insurance managers how best to respond when the unthinkable happens.</p>
<p>Hosted by the Joint Centre for Disaster Research, a venture between GNS Science and Massey, the programme features day-long courses on subjects such as developing effective all-hazard warning systems, evacuation planning and welfare and the range of emergency management planning processes available.</p>
<p>High profile disasters such as the North Island floods in 2004, the Boxing Day tsunami of that same year and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 will be examined.</p>
<p>Centre director David Johnston, pictured left, said the short course programme had different purposes including offering a reminder to New Zealand planners about the ever-present risk of disaster striking even though the country had now gone more than 70 years since a disaster caused large scale death and destruction.</p>

<p>Associate Professor Johnston, who last month had been due to attend an Australian Disaster Conference, which was cancelled in the aftermath of the Victoria bushfires, said that inferno killed a similar number of people to that lost in New Zealand’s last big disaster the Napier earthquake of 1931.</p>
<p>“In the absence of a major New Zealand disaster we can learn a lot from Australia about how communities recover.”</p>
<p>“These courses will identify gaps in our knowledge and deepen our understanding of the complexity of future disasters.”</p>
<p>The Emergency Management Summer Institute is being hosted by the Joint Centre for Disaster Research, School of Psychology, at Massey University’s Wellington campus from March 16-20 in Building 5 room B 14, access from Tasman St.</p>
