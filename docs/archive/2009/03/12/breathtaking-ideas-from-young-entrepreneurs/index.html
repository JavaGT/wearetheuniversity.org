<p>Breathtaking ideas from young entrepreneurs</p>
<p>An energy boosting ice block, a beat-the-recession internet blog and a gym towel with iPod storage were among the business ideas suggested by students at the launch of the Young Enterprise Scheme (YES).</p>
<p>More than 370 secondary school students from around the North Shore and Rodney took part in the e-day, which was hosted by Massey University on the Albany campus this week.</p>
<p>More than 30 business professionals and experts from the University’s School of Engineering and Advanced Technology were on hand to advise students about their fledgling companies at “speed coaching” sessions.</p>
<p>Dr Aruna Shekar, a senior lecturer in product development at Massey University, spoke to the Year 12 and Year 13 students about how to make their innovative ideas work.</p>
<p>“These are really talented, bright young students. We encouraged them to do a situation analysis and think about the product category, to understand the market and to research the competition,” she says.</p>
<p>“We also asked them to consider the reality of making these ideas work in terms of materials, process and manufacturing, which is key to success.”</p>
<p>YES is a nationwide scheme that teaches high school students the principles of commerce by establishing and running a business within the school curriculum.</p>
<p>It is hosted in the Auckland region by Enterprise North Shore.</p>
<p>Regional co-ordinator Lisa Ford says she saw flecks of brilliance among the participants. “Some of the students’ ideas were absolutely breathtaking; the enterprising and innovative future of the North Shore looks extremely secure,” she says.</p>
