<p>Law of the jungle good enough for National  
    
       </p>
<p>Associate Labour spokesperson Darien Fenton says Labour Minister Kate Wilkinson’s confirmation in the House today that National will not be supporting her member’s bill is a further indication that the Government thinks the law of the jungle is good enough for some low paid workers. </p>
<p>The Minimum Wage and Remuneration Bill has passed through 1st and 2nd readings and is due for committee stages tonight.    The purpose of the Bill is to provide for vulnerable contractors to be paid at least the same minimum wage as other workers.</p>
<p>Currently, thousands of drivers, couriers, musicians, actors, leaflet deliverers, cleaners, security workers, food service workers, caregivers and many others are not entitled to minimum wage, because they are employed as “contractors” rather than “employees”. </p>
<p>This means they can be paid whatever can be agreed and in many cases, that amounts to as little as one fifth of the hourly minimum wage.</p>
<p> “The problem is serious.  It is widespread and growing, and with the current economic climate, the temptation to move jobs into contracting will exacerbate” says Darien Fenton.</p>
<p> “It’s disappointing for these workers that John Key’s government is prepared to continue to ignore the situation for thousands of workers who have to live and work by the law of the jungle, because there are no minimum wage protections for them.</p>
<p>“But coming on top of tax increases for the lowest paid and the 90 day Fire at Will Bill, I can’t say I am particularly surprised,” Ms Fenton said. </p>
