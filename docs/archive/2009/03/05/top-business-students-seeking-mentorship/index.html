<p>Top business students seeking mentorship</p>
<p>AUT University’s top business students are seeking mentorship from New Zealand’s best business leaders.</p>
<p>Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE AUT) develop projects for community groups to improve – and sometimes save – lives.</p>
<p>Past projects have included a successful pilot blood donation campaign targeting 18-25-year-olds; mentoring low income families on how to gain wealth through health; and providing work skill seminars and support for young mothers seeking to return to the workforce.</p>
<p>SIFE AUT president and Masters of Business student Clare George says by supporting the students, business mentors will be supporting some of New Zealand’s most deserving communities.</p>
<p>“Our thirst for knowledge is fuelled by New Zealand’s best business professionals’ desire to share it,” she says. “In 2009, we intend to build a strong army of national advisors to ensure we give Kiwi community groups the best support possible.”</p>
<p>George adds that in recessionary times businesses are financially strained but this is an opportunity for them to help without reaching into wallets.</p>
<p>“Corporate social responsibility is increasingly important and we hope that asking for business professionals to lend us their time that the end result is creating a better New Zealand from the ground up.”</p>
<p>SIFE AUT is seeking advisors from all business disciplines and work experience, “from those fresh in the workforce, to CEOs,” adds George.</p>
<p>SIFE AUT represented New Zealand at the SIFE World Cup the past three years in a row and were placed in the top 16 teams in the world from 1800 institutions.</p>
