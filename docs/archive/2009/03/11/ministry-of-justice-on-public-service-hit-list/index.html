<p><strong>Wednesday, 11 March 2009, 5:32 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Ministry of Justice next on public service hit list</p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice is set to be the next government organisation to have cuts made to the number of frontline staff, Labour State Services Spokesperson Grant Robertson revealed in Parliament today.</p>
<p>“The Justice Department is currently holding an operations structure review with field staff, including collections positions amongst those being reviewed.</p>
<p>“Not only is National breaking its promise of not cutting public service numbers it is now looking at cutting frontline staff as well.</p>
<p>“The discovery of potential cut backs at the Justice Department comes hard on the heals of yesterday’s announcement of staff cuts at the Ministry for Environment, Tertiary Education Commission, possible cut backs at Ministry of Social Development and the National Library.</p>
<p>“This Government held a jobs summit aiming to protect and even develop jobs, yet John Key and his Ministers think nothing of making public servants redundant.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that the National Government regards public servants as second class citizens who are easily dispensed with.</p>
<p>“What they fail to recognise is that these public servants are people who have children to support, mortgages to pay and food to buy. These people are ordinary New Zealanders doing the best for their families, but the Government is certainly not doing its best for them.</p>
<p>“This government has broken its promise to cap not cut the public service and its breaking the promise it made at the jobs summit to New Zealanders to promote and protect jobs,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
