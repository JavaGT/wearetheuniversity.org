<p>Ulmer inspires Massey Academy of Sport intake</p>
<p>Olympic champion cyclist Sarah Ulmer gave this year’s Academy of Sport class insights into the life of an elite athlete at the Manawatu campus last night.</p>
<p>Ms Ulmer, who is studying French extramurally at the University this year, was the special guest at an event officially welcoming the 36 academy members to Massey.</p>
<p>She showed a video presentation covering her cycling career and answered questions.</p>
<p>The academy has members from an array of sports, including motor racing, equestrian, canoeing, tae kwon do and squash.</p>
<p>Athletes returning to the academy include Olympic shooter Rob Eastham, national barefoot waterskiing record-holder Kelly O’Donnell and motor racing driver Anthony Pedersen. There are 20 first-year members.</p>
<p>Athletes are given specialised training to help balance their commitments with their study, while also gaining sport-specific skills in nutrition, sport psychology and physical conditioning.</p>
<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor and regional chief executive Professor Ian Warrington says the academy has attracted some of the best.</p>
<p>“A large number of exciting young sportspeople have again chosen Massey, recognising that the University can provide the necessary support to reach their sporting and academic goals,” Professor Warrington says. “It proves that Massey University, and particularly the Manawatu campus, is the pre-eminent tertiary destination for New Zealand’s aspiring young athletes.”</p>

<p>Massey students have also been awarded 101 Prime Minister’s Athlete Scholarships this year. The scholarship programme is a Government initiative managed by Sparc and administered by the national Academy of Sport. The scholarship allows athletes to have their academic fees paid (at domestic student rates) to a maximum of $10,000 per annum, and receive a living allowance of up to $6000 per annum.</p>
<p>“Massey has been chosen by almost a third of the 356 scholarship recipients this year, which again shows that the support and flexibility offered at the University is appreciated by the country’s sporting elite,” Professor Warrington says.</p>
<p>High performance co-ordinator Peter Homburg says the academic year is in full swing and academy members are already making their mark in the sporting world.</p>
<p>“A number of members have achieved success this year, with Hannah Appleton winning the young rider dressage title at the Horse of the Year event, and cyclist Emma Petersen, the national under-19 criterium and road cycling champion, is currently racing in Canada with the Ultralink team,” he says. “The academy members have also been involved in a number of seminars and training sessions on nutrition, media training, time-management and goal-setting. The University will continue this support throughout the year.”</p>
