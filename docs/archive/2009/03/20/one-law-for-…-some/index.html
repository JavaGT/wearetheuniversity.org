<p>One Law For … Some</p>
<p>David Garrett MP, ACT New Zealand<br>Friday, March 20 2009</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Law &amp; Order Spokesman David Garrett today demanded to know why there is such a huge disparity between how we treat offenders in a country where we pride ourselves on adhering to the principle of &#39;one law for all&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;According to the &#39;New Zealand Herald&#39; today, police have decided not to charge two private school students who terrorised a woman and her baby with toy guns,&quot; Mr Garrett said.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet, just one day ago, the &#39;New Zealand Herald&#39; reported that a Wanganui pensioner who presented an air gun while confronting six teenaged vandals at his home – which had been tagged or damaged over 10 times in 18 months – could now face charges.</p>
<p>&quot;This situation defies belief.  Using a gun in a robbery results in a charge of aggravated robbery, regardless of whether the gun is real or not.  Yet brandishing a toy gun from an Audi and chasing a mother at high speed is apparently acceptable.  It seems to matter little that this terrified woman had no idea that the guns were fake.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly there is no such thing as &#39;one law for all&#39; in New Zealand: wilful trouble-makers are allowed to walk free while pensioners on heart medication who defend their property face punishment.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT has long championed the principle of &#39;one law for all&#39; and advocated for the rights of decent New Zealanders.  It is hugely disappointing to see that the police do not adhere to the same ethos.  It appears that there is one law for private school boys from affluent families and another for pensioners in Wanganui, Mr Garrett said&quot;.</p>
