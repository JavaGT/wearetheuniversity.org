<p>School system fails in its own approach to teaching children to read</p>
<p>A significant number of children start school without the language experiences they need to be able to learn to read, says the head of the University&#39;s College of Education, Professor James Chapman.</p>
<p>&quot;These children have little knowledge of books, of the alphabet, or of the sounds that make up words in spoken language,&quot; Professor Chapman says. &quot;We call this a lack of &#39;literate cultural capital&#39;. Home background and pre-school experiences play an important role in language development, which is necessary for a child to be able to learn to read.</p>
<p>&quot;We have an approach to reading instruction in New Zealand junior school classrooms that tends to favour children from middle-class families. These children typically have the language skills necessary for benefiting from the type of instructional approach to beginning reading, known as whole language.</p>
<p>&quot;Children who start school without these language experiences are disadvantaged. There is a scientifically supported mix of instructional approaches that would better suit children who come to school without the typical middle-class language background experiences.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a serious issue because the instructional approach contributes to the development of a wide gap in reading performance among New Zealand school children. It shows up later in poor adult literacy performance. It affects children&#39;s performance in secondary schools, and we are seeing increasing numbers of students coming into the university without strong literacy foundations.&quot;</p>
