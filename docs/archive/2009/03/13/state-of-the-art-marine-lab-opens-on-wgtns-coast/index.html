<p>State-of-the-art marine lab opens on Wellington’s south coast</p>
<p>A new state-of-the-art coastal research facility was officially opened yesterday on Wellington’s south coast.</p>
<p>At the opening of the $5 million Victoria University Coastal Ecology Laboratory (VUCEL), Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh said the new two-storey, 815sqm facility marks a watershed in the University’s growing marine biology and ecology research programmes.</p>
<p>“Since 2002, we’ve made six new permanent academic appointments in marine biology, and postgraduate students now number more than 40, making Victoria University one of New Zealand’s largest marine biology programmes,” he says.</p>
<p>The new facility replaces the University’s former marine laboratory that was originally built in the 1950s by the Glaxo Company as a fish liver oil refining plant. Despite the fact that Victoria University proposed a marine laboratory facility at Island Bay as early as the 1920s, it was not until the 1960s that the University actually acquired the site from Glaxo and developed it into a marine laboratory.</p>
<p>“The former marine lab was too small to accommodate our expanding programmes, so we are thrilled to have secured such a modern, technologically-advanced facility,” says Professor Walsh.</p>
<p>VUCEL Director, Dr Jeff Shima, says the new laboratory provides office space, traditional research laboratories, and “wet laboratories” with flowing sea water supplying aquaria and tanks, to support the research activities of approximately 30 researchers and support staff.</p>

<p>Key research currently being undertaken includes field experiments aimed at uncovering what drives fish population dynamics—and the effects of climate change on coastal marine species.</p>
<p>Recycled materials, natural lighting and heating have been employed throughout the new building and the exterior design is intended to align with the natural surroundings of the south coast.</p>
<p>A kaitiaki, or guardian of the house, carved by local artist Tamatea Kopua of Tolaga Bay, was commissioned for the entrance. Dr Shima says the VUCEL has also been future-proofed against a project sea-level rise by elevating the site.</p>
<p>Unlike the proposed Marine Education Centre, which formerly leased space on the site from Victoria University, Dr Shima says the VUCEL is a working research facility that will only be open to the public during special events that showcase the laboratory’s scientific activities, such as New Zealand’s annual Sea Week campaign that coincided with yesterday’s VUCEL opening.</p>
