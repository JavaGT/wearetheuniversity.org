<p>Monday, March 9, 2009<br>Pregnant women needed for nutrition study</p>
<p>Researchers are currently conducting a study into the nutrient intake of pregnant women.</p>
<p>The study requires the participation of pregnant women in the Manawatu region who are willing to have their diet monitored during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Dr Louise Brough, Associate Professor Jane Coad and Dr Janet Weber, human nutritionists in the Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health, are conducting the research.</p>
<p>Dr Brough says the study will assess the intake of micronutrients such as iron, iodine and selinium.</p>
<p>“We’ll study what the women are eating and assess their micronutrient intake,” Dr Brough says. “There are a lot of messages out there about what not to eat during pregnancy. Some women may be cutting out entire food groups and we want to find out what impact this has upon micronutrient intake and status.”</p>
<p>The researchers hope to recruit 50 pregnant women who are in the third trimester of pregnancy (26 weeks or more), or mothers who are breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Participants will need to be in good health and have had a pregnancy free of complications.</p>
<p>Details of women’s diets will be recorded and they will be asked to provide urine and breast milk samples to assess micronutrient status.</p>
<p>Participants will receive feedback on their diet from the researchers if they are interested. Anyone wishing to take part or find out more about the study should contact Dr Brough at the institute.</p>
