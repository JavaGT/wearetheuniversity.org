<p>Condolences to family after tragic bridge death</p>
<p>Massey University has expressed sincere condolences to the family and friends of Catherine Mary Peters, an 18-year-old first-year student who died last night after an accident at the Ballance Bridge in the Manawatu Gorge.</p>
<p><img src="http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/0903/dfe49c7aefc9e4cfd97c.jpeg" alt="">Catherine, from Christchurch, was a veterinary science student who lived in the Massey Manawatu campus halls of residence.</p>
<p>She was one of a group of students from the Massey University Alpine Club who travelled to Ballance yesterday to take part in a bridge swing event, run by a commercial company based in Palmerston North. The club is one of many that are affiliated to the Massey University Students’ Association.</p>
<p>Police say she fell about 22m from the swing at about 2.45pm onto rocks in the riverbed, sustaining serious injuries. She died in Palmerston North Hospital last night.</p>
<p>Members of her family travelled to Palmerston North today and were met by senior Massey staff, who are providing full support.</p>
<p>University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says Massey staff are providing support and counselling to the other students present during the incident, many of who live in the halls of residence.</p>
<p>“The University is shocked by this incident and has conveyed its condolences to the family. We will work closely with them to give them all the support we can. We will also work closely with students and the students association to ensure they have the support they need.”</p>
