<p>Baroness Cox From Britain’s House Of Lords To Visit New Zealand</p>
<p>“27 million men, women and children around the world are suffering from some form of slavery right now. Freedom is indivisible—we cannot enjoy our freedom while others are denied theirs,” says Baroness Cox.</p>
<p>Baroness Cox is visiting New Zealand (from Wednesday 25 to Friday 27 March) and will be urging New Zealanders to wake up to the devastating impact of human trafficking—to use their freedom to work for the freedom of others. She will deliver a lecture titled “What is at stake?: Why we need to value the foundations of Western civilisation.” The lecture will be given in Christchurch on 26 March 2009 and in Auckland on 27 March 2009 (please find invitation attached). She will also be giving an address to the National Press Club, at a luncheon on Wednesday 25 March.</p>
<p>Baroness (Caroline) Cox is a woman who has had access to some of the most extreme parts of the world. She regularly finds herself in the corridors of power, the sites of civil war and closed states such as North Korea. Already this year, Baroness Cox has spent time in Sudan, Northern Uganda and North Korea, working with NGOs and Governments to see positive change take place.</p>
<p>In her lecture, Baroness Cox will draw from her experiences in a range of countries to explain the importance of our own heritage in the West and the importance of cherishing our foundational values such as freedom, respect and responsibility.</p>
