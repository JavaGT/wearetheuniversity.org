<p><strong>Monday, 23 March 2009, 11:28 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon David Cunliffe<br>Finance spokesperson</p>
<p>22 March 2009 Media Statement<br>Prime Minister fails to answer basic questions on the economy</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Key seemed stumped by the most basic questions on jobs today – unable to say how many are being cut by government or retained by the 9 day fortnight Labour Finance Spokesperson David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister told TVNZ today that ‘anecdotally’ he had heard ‘one or two’ employers might be interested in signing up to the nine day fortnight, a far cry from the hundred thousand predicted at the jobs summit</p>
<p>“Labour supports a strong focus on jobs. So it is disappointing that the Prime Minister cannot provide basic information about major initiatives such as the 9 day fortnight and the impact of public sector cuts</p>
<p>Mr Cunliffe was also disappointed that John Key confirmed that he had changed his stance from reducing government contributions to the Superfund and was now looking at suspending these altogether.</p>
<p>“It is simply poor economics to have a government failing to contribute to the Superfund when we have an increasingly ageing population.</p>
<p>“Suspending payments today will harm New Zealanders in the long run and put an unfair burden on our kids.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister said today he would borrow $40 billion over the next three years, but so far we have seen little evidence of a plan to see this invested in high value programmes that create jobs and promote economic growth.</p>
<p>“Clearly National has borrowed billions to pay for useless tax cuts for the rich, ideology has its price – one that all New Zealanders will be paying for down the track.</p>
<p>“Labour will support initiatives to save jobs and promote economic growth; unfortunately we have seen little in the way of a plan to promote either of these.</p>
