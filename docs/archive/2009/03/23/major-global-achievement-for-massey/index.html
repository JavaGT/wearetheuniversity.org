<p>Major global achievement for Massey</p>
<p>The University today formally signed an agreement with Singapore Polytechnic that will significantly boost the number of students graduating from the food technology programme.</p>
<p>Massey was chosen as the food technology provider for the polytechnic after a worldwide search.</p>
<p>The collaboration has seen 33 students from the polytechnic begin studies at a Massey facility in Singapore to complete the final two years of a Bachelor in Food Technology.</p>
<p>Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health staff have begun teaching in Singapore and Institute head Professor Richard Archer says the polytechnic will send its top students here as well.</p>
<p>“Later this year we will invite the top half of the programme to come to the Manawatu campus to complete the course,” he says. “The relationship is definitely growing and will continue to do so as these students move through the programme and consider postgraduate research at Massey.”</p>
<p>The collaboration has the potential to double the number of graduates from the programme, leading to much larger numbers going on to postgraduate study, Professor Archer says.</p>
<p>Singapore Polytechnic principal, Hang Cheong Tan, signed the agreement with Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey at University House, with Professor Archer witnessing the signing. It was watched by staff and students in Singapore via a video link.</p>

<p>Mr Maharey says the collaboration is proof the food technology programme is a world-leader.</p>
<p>”New Zealand is a food producing country and we’ve developed a world-class programme of study that adds value to the industry. It is an honour to be able to enter into this agreement with the polytechnic.”</p>
<p>Mr Tan says Singapore’s Ministry of Education was looking for world-class programmes to offer its students. “Massey is an ideal partner with renowned lecturers in the field, I hope this is a long-lasting partnership.”</p>
