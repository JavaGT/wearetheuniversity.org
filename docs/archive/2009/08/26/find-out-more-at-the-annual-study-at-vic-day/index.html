<p><strong>Find out more at the annual ‘Study at Vic’ day</strong></p>
<p>Over 3,500 prospective students from throughout New Zealand will visit Victoria University’s Kelburn campus this week.</p>
<p>On Friday 28 August from 8.30am, students, whānau and teachers will spend the day finding out what Victoria has to offer.</p>
<p>“The ‘Study at Vic’ day is a great opportunity for prospective students to come and sample life at our capital city university,” says Susan Harper, director of Student Recruitment and Course Advice at Victoria University.</p>
<p>“We hold it every year and it always proves to be a popular and worthwhile experience for prospective students from around the country.”</p>
<p>“Visitors will have the opportunity to talk to staff and current students, look around the facilities on offer and attend information sessions to get an insight into first-year study options,” she says.</p>
<p>The Kelburn campus will be the base of the day’s activities with more than 65 information sessions as well as displays and competitions.</p>
<p>There will be tours of all four campuses throughout the day:</p>
<p>• Kelburn campus (Faculties of Humanities and Social Sciences, Science and Engineering)<br>• Pipitea campus (Faculties of Commerce and Administration and Law<br>• Karori campus (College of Education)<br>• Te Aro campus (Faculty of Architecture and Design)</p>
<p>There will also be tours of the halls of residence. Free buses will run between the campuses all day.</p>
