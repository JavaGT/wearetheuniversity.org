<p><strong>Wednesday, 19 August 2009, 11:50 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>19 August 2009<br>Media Statement</p>
<p>Tolley should listen to kids over enviroschools</p>
<p>School children from Dunedin and Wellington are calling on Education Minister Anne Tolley to reverse her decision to cut funding to enviroschools.</p>
<p>Primary school students from two Wellington schools will gather on the steps of Parliament today to sign a petition calling on the Minister to reverse her decision to axe enviroschools funding.</p>
<p>Wellington Central MP Grant Robertson, Dunedin South MP Clare Curran, Dunedin North MP Pete Hodgson, Labour Education spokesperson Trevor Mallard and Greens co-leader Metiria Turei will meet with students from Thorndon and Karori West primary schools to draw attention to cuts to education for sustainability funding.</p>
<p>“It just doesn’t make sense that, in this time of recession, where people are losing their jobs and having to cut back to make ends meet, that a programme that teaches kids from low socio-economic backgrounds how to grow their own veges, minimise waste, be more energy efficient, how to landscape and the principles of eco-building is considered a waste of money?” Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>Ms Tolley has been asked to attend the event.</p>
<p>There are 692 enviroschools, across New Zealand with 213,550 students.</p>
<p>“Education for sustainability provides the academic rigour and research to the enviroschools programme.</p>
<p>“Across Dunedin there are 37 schools in total that are part of the programme. I’ve seen first hand the benefits enviroschools bring to schools, particularly those that are low decile.</p>
<p>“Teachers and schools kids are passionate about environmental education and are upset National’s decision to cut enviroschool funding,” Clare Curran said.</p>
