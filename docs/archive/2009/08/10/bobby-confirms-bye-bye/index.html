<p>Bobby confirms bye bye</p>
<p>by Michael Oliver</p>
<p>Newly elected President of Can-Do, Robert Latimer, has officially resigned his post as Education Officer on VUWSA’s Exec.</p>
<p>Latimer’s resignation had been announced at Can-Do’s AGM two weeks ago, but had not been made official until last Wednesday when the written resignation was delivered.</p>
<p>He cited both a need to focus on his studies and a well-established dislike of VUWSA President Jasmine Freemantle’s style as the impetus for resigning.</p>
<p>He also cited a perceived “conflict of interest” with relationships within the association.</p>
<p>“The lack of transparency inside VUWSA in regards to relationships between the President and Vice-President [Education] which as not been disclosed that they are in a form of relationship of an adult nature,” Latimer said in his resignation.</p>
<p>“This I believe this is a conflict of interest which the students need to know about.”</p>
<p>VUWSA President Jasmine Freemantle said she wished Latimer well in his role as Can-Do President.</p>
<p>In light of Latimer’s resignation, VUWSA has opened applications for Acting Welfare Officer.</p>
<p>The Acting Welfare Officer will have all the rights and responsibilities of an executive member with the exception that they are not able to cast a vote at executive meetings.</p>
<p>The Acting Welfare Officer will be appointed at the Exec’s weekly meeting on 19 August.</p>
