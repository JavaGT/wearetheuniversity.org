<p>Hundreds protest adult class funding cuts</p>
<p>by Elliot Stevenson</p>
<p>A turnout of 200 people in a march against night-class funding cuts last Tuesday was described as “pleasing” by members of the adult education community.</p>
<p>Braving rain and cold, protestors chanted “They say cut backs, we say fight back” on a march which left Wellington High School en-route to parliament.</p>
<p>The protest intended to make a stand against the government’s $16 million funding cut to Adult Community Education—equal to 80 percent of the sector’s total funding.</p>
<p>Students of Adult Community Education have felt night classes—which range from Moroccan Cooking to Parenting—offered a social environment to learn life-enhancing skills.</p>
<p>A student, who attends a night Information-Technology class, suggested that skills taught in night classes provide new opportunities for people to enter the workforce.</p>
<p>“You can’t put a price on that,” he said.</p>
<p>Acting director of Adult Community Education Robyn Hambleton said the turnout was heart-warming and demonstrated how concerned people were.</p>
<p>“This decision will mean the end of a 100-year-old tradition of night classes throughout New Zealand,” he said.</p>
<p>Minister of Education Anne Tolley drew criticism from Labour Spokesperson for Education Maryan Street for describing night classes as “hobbies.”</p>
<p>“How can she determine what a hobby class [is] to one person and what is a life changing opportunity for another?” Street said to the crowd on Parliament’s steps.</p>
<p>The announcement that Tolley would not be meeting the crowd was met by a resounding “SHAME” from protestors.</p>
<p>Labour has said the National government had underestimated the public backlash to the cuts, and that the 200 protestors out stood as a testament to considerable public opposition.</p>
<p>The funding cuts will be effective from January 2010.</p>
