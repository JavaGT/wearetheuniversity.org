<p><strong>Massey University gains third place in Tertiary Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Massey University Albany performed exceptionally well at the recently held Tertiary Challenge, gaining 3rd place in the prestigious inter-institution sports tournament. Featuring 14 teams from around the Northern region, Massey Albany defeated teams from tertiary institutions such as the University of Auckland, MIT and Unitec.</p>
<p>Held at Waikato University, Hamilton, Team Albany had an 85-player strong contingent and competed in a number of sports, including Basketball; Netball; Touch Rugby; Volleyball and Soccer, in which both the teams gained 3rd place in their respective sport, and Ultimate Frisbee, in which the team garnered an impressive 2nd place.</p>
<p>Clubs’ Development Officer and Co-ordinator of the Tertiary Challenge teams for Albany, Wesley Higgins, is immensely pleased with the result: “As a team, we are extraordinarily happy with the commitment and passion that our athletes played with and we see sport as a vital component of campus life at Massey University Albany” he said.</p>
<p>President of the Albany Students’ Association, Rawa Karetai, is extremely proud of the dedication and commitment shown by both the athletes and their support staff this year, even dressing up in a giant rooster costume to show his support on the day.</p>
<p>Team Albany intends to take part in the Tertiary Challenge next year and looks forward to developing a bigger, stronger and better delegation for 2010.</p>
