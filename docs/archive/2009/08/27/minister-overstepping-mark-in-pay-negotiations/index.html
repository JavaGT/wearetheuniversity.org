<p>Minister overstepping mark in pay negotiations</p>
<p>State Services Minister Tony Ryall has been caught meddling in the negotiation of employment agreements at Polytechnics, well outside the legislated process, Labour State Services spokesperson Grant Robertson said today.</p>
<p>“Last week Tony Ryall and Tertiary Education Minister Anne Tolley summoned the Council Chairs and Chief Executives of three Polytechnics to Wellington to get a dressing down about the pay negotiations they had under way or had recently completed,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>“This is completely outside the process for negotiating employment agreements at tertiary institutions laid down in the State Sector Act.</p>
<p>“The State Services Commission has a consultative role in the process, but institutions have autonomy to finalise agreements. The idea that the Minister would become involved is well outside the legislated process.</p>
<p>“The Tertiary Education Union has raised concerns that the State Services Commission has stepped outside its legislative brief as well by intervening in a number of negotiations well beyond their consultative role.&quot;</p>
<p>Grant Robertson says the Minister appears to be making the matter far worse by intervening at a political level.</p>
<p>“This is a serious issue. The government does not have a direct role in employment negotiations in tertiary institutions,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>“The Chief Executive is the employer of the staff, and they will make the decision in consultation with the SSC. The Minister is riding roughshod over this process.</p>
<p>“I understand the Minister’s concern is that agreements with a 2 or 3% pay increase at Polytechnics go against his desire for a pay freeze in the state sector.</p>
<p>“When he announced his expectations for state sector pay in February the Minister wasn’t prepared to admit he was seeking a pay freeze. It’s clear now by his unprecedented intervention that this is exactly what he was after.</p>
<p>“The Minister needs to respect the law and process as it is laid down, and leave Polytechnic Chief Executives to do their job.” Grant Robertson said.</p>
