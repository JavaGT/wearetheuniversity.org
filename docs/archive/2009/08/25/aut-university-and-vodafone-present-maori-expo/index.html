<p>AUT has joined forces with Vodafone this year to bring you Auckland’s best-established and show-stopping celebration of Maori achievement- AUT Maori Expo and it’s on this week!</p>
<p>With the help of Vodafone, this year’s expo is going to bigger and better than ever, starting off with a new venue, Vector Arena.</p>
<p>“AUT Maori Expo is a significant event for AUT and we’re pleased to be able to partner with Vodafone to showcase the best of Maori culture,” says Vivien Bridgwater, General Manager, AUT University Relations and Advancement.</p>
<p>Vodafone CEO Russell Stanners, says Vodafone is proud to support community events like this that showcase Maori achievement and culture.</p>
<p>“Vodafone and AUT have a long-standing relationship and we’re proud to support this event that celebrates New Zealand’s diversity,” says Stanners.</p>
<p>The biennial event has moved from the Aotea Centre to Vector to allow for the massive growth and the huge lineup of entertainment this year. You’ll be able to see exhibitors from a range of organisations like universities, the army and police, government and community organisations. There will also be a fashion show featuring top Maori designers, entertainment in the form of kapa haka and dance groups as well as some traditional Maori kai like hangi, raw fish and mussel fritters.</p>
