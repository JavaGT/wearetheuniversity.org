<p><strong>Tuesday, August 4, 2009</strong><br><strong>School pupils compete to solve economic woes</strong></p>
<p>Teams from schools in Auckland and Wellington will attempt to help solve the country’s economic woes during the inaugural ANZ Massey Economics Challenge at Albany campus next month.</p>
<p>Economics professor Anne de Bruin, one of the organisers, says the event has potential to help not only the pupils taking part, but also the national economy.</p>
<p>“The macroeconomics presentation is on <em>How can we protect the New Zealand economy from global recession</em>, which is timely and will hopefully turn up some fresh, innovative ideas,&quot; Professor de Bruin says. &quot;The microeconomics team quiz is also closely linked to the school curriculum, so it is highly relevant for all students.”</p>
<p>The aim is to foster a greater interest in economics in secondary schools and support those with innovative ideas, as well as to establish closer links with educational organisations, the business community and policymakers.</p>
<p>Each of the teams is assigned a Massey student as a mentor, who will provide guidance and support before the challenge, and guide them around the campus. “It will be quite a buzz for our students and the school students to be part of it,” says Professor de Bruin.</p>
<p>Judges of the macroeconomics presentation are financial writer and commentator Mary Holm, the Treasury&#39;s principal tax adviser, Norman Gemmell, and College of Business Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Lawrence Rose.</p>
<p>Three senior lecturers from the University will judge the microeconomic challenge judges.<br>Professor de Bruin says the entry of a team from Scots College in Wellington has prompted the organisers to extend the challenge next year to become a national event on all three Massey campuses.</p>
<p>There are still places available for schools wishing to enter this year&#39;s challenge. Register at: <a href="http://econchallenge.massey.ac.nz/">http://econchallenge.massey.ac.nz/</a></p>
