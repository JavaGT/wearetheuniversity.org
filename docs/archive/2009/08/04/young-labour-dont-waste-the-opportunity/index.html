<p>Press Release: For Immediate Release</p>
<p>Young Labour: Don’t Waste the Opportunity</p>
<p>Tuesday 4th August 2009</p>
<p>Young Labour welcomes the Government’s apparent desire to tackle the problem of youth unemployment but remains to be convinced by the details.</p>
<p>The Youth Opportunities programme set out on Sunday was originally sold as a ‘plan to wipe out youth unemployment’ but in reality it only scratches the surface. Key seems to have realised this quite quickly – he was back-peddling even faster than over his cycleway proposals yesterday, saying that the Government did not think it could stop youth unemployment rising.</p>
<p>&quot;The Prime Minister claims all he can try to do is take the “rough edges off the recession” for youth – perhaps he should have taken the rough edges off his plan before releasing it.” Young Labour President, Patrick Leyland, said this morning.</p>
<p>“Yesterday’s proposals provide short-term fixes, with 6 month placements and 6 week courses, but do not address the fundamental problem. Youth unemployment rates have been historically high around the world and the consensus opinion on its cause – lack of skills.”</p>
<p>“So what was Key’s reaction to this skill shortage? Give these lazy young people a shovel so they can build my ‘great rides’ – if they’re out of breath they can’t complain, and if they do, they’re off to boot-camp.” Leyland explained.</p>
<p>“Frankly 2,500 places on ‘6-week military-style training programmes’ and ‘military-focused skills in school’ do not equate to a plan to up-skill the country’s youth.”</p>

<p>“The government has also cited industry partnerships, new scholarships and token Polytech funding boosts as part of a skills response to youth unemployment. But this must be seen as shameless opportunism or a serious admission of error, considering that Budget 2009:</p>
<p>• systematically slashed industry training and modern apprenticeships<br>• cut tertiary scholarships for the most disadvantaged<br>• told Polytechs that if they cannot cope on their own then they should fold<br>• and systematically gutted Adult and Community Education</p>
<p>“Key loves headlines but if we look at his track record, well the proof is in the pudding… will this latest plan turn out like his Budget and Jobs Summit - resembling badly cooked soufflés.” Leyland concluded.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
