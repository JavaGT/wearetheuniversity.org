<p>Research looks at partner violence</p>
<p>Māori are twice as likely to be the victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) over a lifetime and over the past 12 months, according to research by Victoria University student Fleur McLaren.</p>
<p>As part of her Master’s thesis, Mrs McLaren looked at the risk factors for IPV victimisation of all New Zealanders over a lifetime and over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>“My research looked at the factors that are strong predictors for IPV victimisation, including ethnicity, employment and socio-economic status,” says Mrs McLaren.</p>
<p>Her thesis analysed complex survey data from the New Zealand National Survey of Crime and Victimisation Survey 2001 (Ministry of Justice).</p>
<p>“The strong predictors for IPV over a lifetime included Māori, people aged 25-29 years, females, solo parents, over-crowded households, those on social welfare benefits, and those divorced and separated.”</p>
<p>For the 12 month prevalence of IPV, strong predictors were those aged 15-24 years, Māori, lower socio economic groups, solo parents with children, those in defacto relationships and those who do not own or rent a house.</p>
<p>“Ethnicity is strongly significant in explaining victimisation even when other variables are factored into the model.”</p>
<p>Mrs McLaren is currently developing her proposal for a PhD in Criminology, and aims to look at how young adults establish intimate dating relationships that are either healthy or characterised by violence.</p>
<p>“This study will be the first to capture New Zealand specific data on the dynamics that exist in young adult intimate relationships and the pathways that lead to a healthy or violent relationship.”</p>
