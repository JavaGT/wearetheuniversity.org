<p><strong>Wednesday, 12 August 2009, 2:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Impact/Collision—Three Short Plays</p>
<p>Impact/Collision, the first of four seasons showcasing third year theatre students’ directing talents at Victoria University, promises to start things with a bang.</p>
<p>It’s not everyday you get the chance to see three plays in one evening, but each of the seasons on offer from the students of Theatre 304 gives you just that.</p>
<p>The three young directors are promising the first season, which focuses on hard-hitting plays from three generations of controversial U.K. playwrights, will pull no punches.</p>
<p>The season kicks off with Benyamin Albert directing Caryl Churchill’s This is a Chair. Mr Albert says it is a play that explores contradiction and metaphor.</p>
<p>“The play concerns the carelessness of people, the nature of knowledge and how it relates to reality.”</p>
<p>Following that, Mitch Tawhi-Thomas directs a New Zealand premiere of Mark Ravenhill’s Shoot/Get Treasure/Repeat: Love (But I Won’t Do That). The play, set in war-torn Iraq in 2004, involves a British civilian and Māori security guard’s quest “to stay sane in an insane world,” says Mr Tawhi-Thomas.</p>
<p>Wrapping up the evening is Harry Meech’s production of Edward Bond’s Passion—a play where the dead speak.</p>
<p>“We may bury their bones and smother their sins in crosses and kind words, but the dead, in having lived their lives, still speak,” says Mr Meech.</p>
<p>With three hard-hitting plays from three generations of controversial U.K. playwrights, Impact/Colllision is a night out not to be missed.<br> <br>What: Impact/Collision—Three Short Plays</p>
<p>Where: Studio 77, 77 Fairlie Terrace (Gate 10 of Victoria University’s Kelburn Campus)</p>
<p>When: 7pm, 19-22 August 2009</p>
