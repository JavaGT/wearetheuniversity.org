<p>Snell to open garden before knighthood</p>
<p>Associate Professor Peter Snell will officiate at the opening of a Petone school&#39;s garden today.</p>
<p>Dr Snell is involved in the Ka Pai Kai initiative at Sacred Heart Primary School, which began last year.</p>
<p>Since 2007, when he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Science by the University, Dr Snell has held an honorary position with Te Pümanawa Hauora – the University&#39;s Research Centre for Mäori Health and Development – as Associate Professor of Exercise Science.</p>
<p>He has been involved as a research collaborator and supervisor of doctoral students.</p>
<p>Te Pümanawa Hauora director head Professor Cunningham says the garden initiative is a learning tool and an opportunity for the pupils to have experience working in a garden. The objectives are to improve learning and choices for good nutrition, improve physical activity programmes and participation, and increase access to tertiary education for Mäori, Pacific and all students by active University partnerships at primary school level.</p>
<p>Dr Snell is an associate professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre, and has a Bachelor of Science in human performance from the University of California at Davis and a PhD in exercise physiology from Washington State University. He is a three-time Olympic gold medallist (800m at Rome, 1960; 800m and 1500m, Tokyo, 1964) and breaker of multiple world records, one of which (for the mile on a grass track) still stands.</p>
<p>Tomorrow he will receive a knighthood in Wellington.</p>
<p>While back in New Zealand he will also promote Massey&#39;s Peter Snell Doctoral Scholarships in Public Health and Exercise Science. The scholarships support research aimed at keeping New Zealanders healthy and provide payment of doctoral fees and an annual stipend of $25,000.</p>
