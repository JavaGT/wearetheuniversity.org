<p>20 August 2009 Media Statement</p>
<p>Redeployment scheme a charade</p>
<p>Tony Ryall’s half hearted attempt to limit public service job losses has been uncovered as another smoke and mirrors campaign from National, Labour’s State Services spokesperson Grant Robertson said today.</p>
<p>“National’s public service redeployment strategy announced in May was targeted at minimising the impact of public sector layoffs. But it seems the strategy itself has had minimal effect,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>“1500 public service jobs have been axed since National came to power. In an attempt to calm the waters State Services Minister Tony Ryall announced the redeployment scheme but embarrassingly he’s been forced to admit just two jobs have been saved by it to date.</p>
<p>“Let’s not forget this is happening after National broke its election promise to cap, not cut, the public sector.</p>
<p>“The redeployment scheme is a charade. While it sounds good in principle, it’s achieving nothing to ensure knowledge is retained and people are being looked after.”</p>
<p>Grant Robertson is calling on Tony Ryall to be more upfront about National’s agenda for the public service, and the effectiveness of the redeployment scheme, in the future.</p>
<p>“Tony Ryall only admitted the woeful uptake of the scheme after media questioning. If the Minister was more than happy to trumpet its potential benefits back in May, he should be open and honest about its shortcomings,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>“These are difficult times and everything must be done to improve efficiency in the public service, but it should not be to the detriment of delivering core public services, or to public servants facing redundancy.</p>
<p>“Thousands of hardworking New Zealanders employed by the state are losing their jobs. They thought National was throwing them a lifeline but it seems all they’re getting is lip service.” Grant Robertson said.</p>
