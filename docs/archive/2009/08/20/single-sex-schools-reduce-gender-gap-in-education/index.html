<p>Single-sex schooling reduces gender gap in educational achievement</p>
<p>Recent research from the long-running Christchurch Heath and Development Study at the University of Otago, Christchurch shows that single-sex schooling may help to reduce the gender gap in educational achievement, producing a situation in which boys have a slight advantage over girls.</p>
<p>The study published in the Australian Journal of Education is based on comparisons of the educational achievements of over 900 boys and girls who attended single-sex and coeducational secondary schools in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It examines whether the size and direction of the gender gap in educational achievement is different at single-sex and coeducational secondary schools.</p>
<p>This study showed that there were clear differences between the two school types in both the size and direction of the gender gap.</p>
<p>For students attending single-sex secondary schools, there was a slight tendency for males to outperform females. In contrast, for students attending co-educational schools, there was a clear tendency for females to outperform males. This pattern continued when students were followed up to the age of 25.</p>
<p>These results held even after accounting for factors associated with attendance at single-sex and coeducational schools.</p>
<p>“These findings are consistent with the argument that attending single-sex schools reduces or mitigates the current gap between boys and girls in educational achievement,” says principal researcher Sheree Gibb.</p>
<p>The effects of single-sex schooling on the gender gap were evident not only in the attainment of secondary school qualifications, but also attendance at university, and in the attainment of Bachelors degrees.</p>
<p>She says this study also provides evidence that the effects of single sex and co-ed schools on the gender gap in educational achievement continues long after students have left school, and even up to the age of 25.</p>
<p>The study suggests that the ways in which schools are organised and structured may have considerable impact on gender gaps in educational achievement.</p>
<p>These gaps may be able to be reduced by identifying the particular features of single-sex schooling that are responsible for reducing male disadvantage in achievement.</p>
<p>This study was funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand.</p>
