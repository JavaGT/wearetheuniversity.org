<p><strong>Animal experimentation figures show shocking increase in suffering</strong></p>
<p>Revelations that the highest number of animals in New Zealand on record have been experimented upon in “research, testing and teaching” are disturbing, said Green Party Animal Welfare Spokesperson Sue Kedgley.</p>
<p>341,520 animals were experimented on last year – a massive 38.45% increase over the previous year, and 17,110 animals died or were euthanised – a 14.5% increase on the previous year, according to the numbers released in the latest National Animal Ethics Advisory Committee (NAEAC) annual report.</p>
<p>“The sharp increase in the number of animals experimented upon shows that the Animal Welfare Act is not working and the commitment to reducing or replacing the number of animals used in experiments is simply spin,” said Ms Kedgley.</p>
<p>The figures include 69,564 cattle, 78,093 sheep, 31,053 birds, 41,057 fish and 792 dogs.</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley said she was surprised to find that many more animals were sourced from farms, than the previous year. The report offered no explanation as to why this was the case.</p>
<p>In 2007 it was revealed farmers were breeding dogs to be used in experiments. The most popular dog was the beagle due to its trusting nature and friendly temperament.</p>
<p>“Perhaps the most worrying aspect of the latest NAEAC report is the fact that 18,721 animals are likely to have suffered severely during experimentation.</p>
<p>“That’s a 12.7 % increase over the previous year. The fact that in New Zealand thousands of animals had to endure severe or very severe suffering in the name of science is appalling,” Ms Kedgley said.</p>

<p>The European Union explicitly prohibits experiments on animals that cause severe pain, distress and suffering.</p>
<p>“The experiments carried out on thousands of New Zealand animals would have been in breach of European regulations. One has to ask, why is there not a similar prohibition here?”</p>
