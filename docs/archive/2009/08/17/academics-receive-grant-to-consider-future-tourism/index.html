<p><strong>Victoria academics receive grant to consider future tourism</strong></p>
<p>A future tourism experience could involve visiting New Zealand national parks via hologram, or experiencing local food or wine using molecules from a memory bank.</p>
<p>Dr Ian Yeoman, Dr John Moriarty and Professor Douglas Pearce of Victoria University’s Management School will receive $791,600 over the next three years from the Foundation of Research, Science and Technology (FRST) and the Ministry of Tourism to construct a series of scenarios about future tourism in New Zealand, which could potentially save the tourism industry at least $60 billion over the next 50 years.</p>
<p>According to Dr Yeoman, in a world of constant change, the challenge for the tourism industry is how to create new experiences when much of the product cannot change.</p>
<p>The team’s project <em>Future Maker or Future Taker: Scenarios for Tourism</em> will examine how our cultural, social, landscape and economic resources interact with future visitor demands.</p>
<p>“Looking into the future, New Zealand’s tourism industry faces many challenges and uncertainties, from climate change and the rapid pace of technological change, to shifting social values,” says Dr Yeoman.</p>
<p>Although tourism currently contributes over 18 percent of New Zealand’s exports, Dr Yeoman says this success is not without risk.</p>
<p>“100% Pure New Zealand is the most successful tourism brand in the world, but that doesn’t guarantee future success. For instance, what if the price of oil was US$400 a barrel or fiscal deficit meant the closure of New Zealand’s national parks?</p>

<p>“Recent events demonstrate that visitor demand can change faster than our responses. Scenario Planning is a methodology that can potentially reduce the risks associated with future visitor expenditures by at least 10 percent, which would mean a possible saving of at least $60 billion over the next 50 years.”</p>
<p>The team will consider future scenarios in depth, and share information with key tourism stakeholders.</p>
<p>“Having a clear understanding of the drivers and aspirations of future visitors could be used to advantage by public or private policymakers and investors,” says Dr Yeoman.</p>
<p>The research team has strong academic, industry and project management skills that are both overlapping and complementary. Dr Yeoman has an international tourism reputation as a scenario planner, publisher and researcher; Dr Moriarty has detailed knowledge of the New Zealand tourism industry and is a specialist in tourism analysis and performance; and Professor Pearce is an internationally respected academic with a history of FRST tourism research success.</p>
