<p><strong>Monday, 17 August 2009, 3:26 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>17 August 2009 Media Statement<br>National continue to make cuts to aged care</p>
<p>New Zealanders should be worried that a third DHB has announced cuts to aged care says Labour Associate Health Spokesperson Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.</p>
<p>“Southland, Otago and now Canterbury DHB are all cutting home support services in a bid to make financial savings.</p>
<p>“It’s worrying that the Government feels elder care should be cut to make financial savings. Elderly will be extremely worried by these cutbacks.</p>
<p>“New Zealand has an aging population so cutting services when demand will only increase makes no sense at all.</p>
<p>“DHBs and the Government should be investing in aged care, not viewing it as an expendable service.</p>
<p>“I have on two occasions sought an inquiry into the quality of care for older people. This would have put this issue into the public domain and enabled wider participation and discussion on this issue.</p>
<p>“An inquiry would have ensured Government funding, which is in excess of $700 million a year, was being targeted to the right services, and that elderly were receiving the most appropriate health services at the right time.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately the National Party blocked this inquiry, because a review of disability services had already been held.</p>
<p>“The fact that National Party members can’t tell the difference between aged care and disability services is a complete disgrace.</p>
<p>“The National Party campaigned on providing better health services. I doubt elderly who are having their health services reduced think that the Government is living up to that promise.</p>
<p>“National are breaking election promises and it’s elderly who are paying the price,” Winnie Laban said.</p>
