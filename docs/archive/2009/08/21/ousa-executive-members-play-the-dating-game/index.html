<p>OUSA Executive Members Play the Dating Game</p>
<p>Four OUSA members – one from each Division of the University – are heading off to a special lunch tomorrow. They are the winners of the Otago University Students’ Association’s ‘Date a Div Rep’ contest.</p>
<p>The contest, run on Facebook, invited students to answer some simple questions about services provided by OUSA – such as representation and advocacy.</p>
<p>One winner from each Division was chosen.</p>
<p>At midday tomorrow, the four will join Harriet Geoghegan (Commerce Divisional Rep), Fiona Bradley (Health Sciences Divisional Rep), Nathalie Saurat (Sciences Divisional Rep) and Cordelia Huxtable (Humanities Divisional Rep) for a meal at the University’s Staff Club Gallery Restaurant.</p>
<p>The contest was a fun way for the Divisional Representatives to communicate to students what their roles are and to remind them of some of the important things OUSA does for its members.</p>
<p>“102 people took the facebook quiz” said Fiona Bradley, “and most respondents got more than 60% of the questions right.”</p>
<p>The promotion follows the Divisional Rep Roadshow last semester, where each Divisional Rep organised a barbeque and big prize draw in their own areas of campus.</p>
