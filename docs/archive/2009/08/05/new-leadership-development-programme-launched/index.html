<p><strong>New Leadership Development Programme Launched</strong></p>
<p>The University of Canterbury has today launched its new Leadership Development Programme for corporate senior and middle managers and for SME owners, directors and managers.</p>
<p>“The programme aims to develop the leadership competencies that will transform organisations for long-term sustainability in the post-recession 21st Century”, said Mr Kyran Newell, Manager, Professional &amp; Executive Development at the University of Canterbury.</p>
<p>“The new context that organisations are facing is different from the pre-recession world of short-term profit maximisation; the new world of holistic thinking and long-term organisational sustainability requires a new set of leadership skills”, he said.</p>
<p>The Leadership Development Programme is a block-taught, 15-day experience, facilitated by the University of Canterbury’s leadership specialists and practitioners from business, services organisations and government. It is supported by international leadership research and best organisational practices.</p>
<p>“The Leadership Model, Leadership Competencies Framework and Key Themes that underpin the programme assure a cohesive and unique programme that is right for our times”, said Mr Newell.</p>
<p>“Participants will engage in leading-edge learning and build a new personal support network while achieving personal growth and development that will transform their leadership and their organisations”.</p>
<p>The inaugural programme is scheduled for 14-18 September, 12-16 October and 16-20 November 2009. Applications are now open.</p>
