<p>Much-Loved Writer Barbara Anderson Honoured</p>
<p>Barbara Anderson will receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Literature from the University of Otago this weekend. This degree marks her enormous contribution to New Zealand literature.</p>
<p>She has written eight novels including the award-winning “Portrait of the Artist’s Wife” and as well as collections of short-stories beginning with “I think we should go into the jungle” in 1989.</p>
<p>Her autobiography “Getting There” was acclaimed by readers and critics last year on publication, with Kate de Goldi calling it, “the best New Zealand autobiography since Janet Frame&#39;s.”</p>
<p>Barbara began her writing career began relatively late in life, after gaining a BSc from Otago in 1947, teaching and working as a medial technician. She met and married Neil and with him, raised their two boys in various ports around the world as Neil pursued his career in the NZ Navy</p>
<p>She has achieved remarkable overseas success with all her novels being published in the UK, gathering fulsome praise from some of writing’s top names: “The promise that was evident in “Girls High” has been splendidly fulfilled, and now it seems only a matter of time before Wellington replaces New York as the literary capital of the world.” Nick Hornby, Sunday Times.</p>
