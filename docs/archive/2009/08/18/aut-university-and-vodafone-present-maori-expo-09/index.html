<p>AUT University and Vodafone present Maori Expo ‘09</p>
<p>AUT University has joined forces with Vodafone to bring you Auckland’s best-established and most exuberant celebration of Maori achievement and culture, AUT Maori Expo ’09.</p>
<p>Maori Expo has undergone a number of changes since the last event in 2007: it has moved to New Zealand’s premier venue, Vector Arena; partnered with Vodafone; and introduced the event’s first night concert, Groove the Night.</p>
<p>During the day visitors will be able to see, hear and taste the best of Maori culture at the Expo with a fashion show featuring top Maori designers, entertainment in the form of kapa haka and dance groups and some good old Maori tucker like hangi, raw fish and mussel fritters.</p>
<p>Later in the day some of the most well known Maori sports people and politicians will discuss the issues of the day in lively and humorous debates.</p>
<p>The sports panel will feature the likes of Oceania Football Player of the Century Wynton Rufer, surfing star Daniel Kereopa, and legendary All Black Buck Shelford, while the political panel will have representatives from the leading political parties including Metiria Turei and Georgina Te Heu Heu, Parekura Horomia and Hone Harawira.</p>
<p>Vector Arena Chief Executive Guy Ngata says the event represents a first for Vector Arena as the first free Maori community event the venue has hosted.</p>
<p>“It’s great that AUT is able to give people the opportunity to experience Maori entertainment and music, and showcase the great Maori talent we have in this country,” Ngata says.</p>

<p>Groove the Night, which kicks off after the expo, will feature the biggest local music line up Vector Arena has seen, with performances from six of New Zealand music’s best and brightest. Che Fu will take to the stage alongside Tahuna Breaks, Three Houses Down, House of Shem, Cornerstone Roots and Aotearoa reggae royalty- Herbs.</p>
<p>The event, now in its 14th year, may have a new face at Vector but is still all about celebrating Maori achievement in all fields – cultural, political, sport, education and the arts. It&#39;s a multi-faceted event everybody will enjoy, but importantly Maori Expo explores how we prepare the next generation of Maori youth for tertiary study and professional careers on a local and international scale.</p>
