<p>Public transport investments create jobs</p>
<p>New Zealand must seize the day and make much-needed public transport investments to create jobs and prevent transport chaos during the Rugby World Cup in 2011.</p>
<p>Green Party Co-Leader Dr Russel Norman said today’s release of annual public transport figures in Auckland is an encouraging sign that more investment in transport infrastructure would create jobs, reduce congestion and protect our environment.</p>
<p>“We have a golden opportunity to build on the successful 7.7 percent rise in patronage, the highest level of public transport use in Auckland since the mid 1980s.</p>
<p>“Today’s news that Treasury expects unemployment to surge by September next year - and yesterday’s quarterly leap in Household Labour Force figures from 5 percent to 6 percent - show New Zealanders clearly need jobs. Increased investment in public transport would create ongoing employment.</p>
<p>2009 research from Australia has shown that investment in public transport generates around 19% more jobs than road building (see Litman reference below).</p>
<p>“It’s also an excellent way to cut our greenhouse gas emissions, cut our oil import bill, and reduce congestion in our cities and towns.</p>
<p>“And if we can fast track Auckland’s public transport improvements, then we also safeguard our international reputation as good hosts as we’ll be able to get the thousands of visiting rugby fans around the city quickly and efficiently.”</p>
<p>Dr Norman said public transport infrastructure needs to be improved all over New Zealand, but Auckland is vital as the city will be on show during the Rugby World Cup.</p>

<p>“Getting it wrong is not an option I savour. The full gaze of the international media will be on Auckland and if our public transport system isn’t operating well, it won’t be a good look.</p>
<p>“It’s vital we maintain momentum on this as the faster and more efficient our public transport becomes, the more appealing it will be for commuters.”</p>
