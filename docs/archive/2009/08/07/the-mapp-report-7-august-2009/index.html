<p>NEW BUSINESS MIGRATION SCHEME</p>
<p>The economy, and local communities, will benefit from National’s new business migration scheme. The scheme aims to boost economic performance by making New Zealand more attractive for business and entrepreneurial migrants. The Prime Minister’s Job Summit made attracting the right business migrants a high priority.</p>
<p>This initiative fulfils National’s election commitment to set realistic requirements for business migrants in capital, language skills, and investment proposals. National’s policy sets out the need to focus on job creation and export earnings. The new policy package is designed for migrants who want to invest, or set up a business, in New Zealand and gain permanent residence.</p>
<p>The categories for investor migrants have been streamlined from three to two. There are more realistic requirements for capital, language skills and time spent in New Zealand annually. There is also far greater flexibility in terms of investment vehicles. The new investor policy was implemented last week. The entrepreneur policy starts in November 2009.</p>

<p>SETTING NEW ZEALAND’S 2020 TARGET</p>
<p>National is committed to combating climate change and reducing New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>New Zealand is doing its fair share in addressing this global problem. National has a target of reducing 1990 emissions by 50% by 2050. It will be a challenge to reach this target, more so than for many European communities, because our emissions have grown so much in recent years. They are already 24% above 1990 levels. The main reason is that the New Zealand population has grown by over 25% since 1990. The only countries with comparable population growth are Australia and the United States, and of course their emissions have also grown.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks, the Government has been engaging with New Zealanders on the subject. The 2020 target is an important decision, with major implications for the environment and the economy. The Government intends to make a careful and considered decision on New Zealand 2020 emissions target. We do not intend to damage New Zealand’s growth prospects by having an unrealistic emissions reduction target.</p>
<p>Climate change is the biggest environmental challenge of this generation. The National-led Government is committed to doing its part.</p>
<p>GREAT RIDES GET GREEN LIGHT</p>
<p>The first seven trails of the New Zealand Cycleway will receive Quick Start funding. The Government has set aside $9 million from the $50 million New Zealand Cycleway Fund to cover feasibility studies and the building of these trails.</p>
<p>If all seven tracks go ahead, they will create close to 300 construction jobs. This will rise to more than 500 jobs a year as supporting businesses are developed.</p>
<p>These seven tracks are only the first projects for the New Zealand Cycleway. As the tracks grow, so too will jobs and tourism. The Cycleway will generate lasting economic, social and environmental benefits for communities across the country.</p>
<p>OUT AND ABOUT</p>
<p>Keeping in touch with our schools</p>
<p>At the end of last month I visited Rangitoto College and had a very positive discussion with the principal, David Hodge. Following this meeting I met with five local Principals to discuss progress in the Education policy. The Principals offered some possible solutions which I will<br>look forward to discussing.</p>
<p>SuperBlues luncheon</p>
<p>Today we had a well attended SuperBlues luncheon. The Member for Tauranga, Simon Bridges, talked about being a Crown Prosecutor prior to politics and also life as a new member of Parliament.</p>
