<p><strong>Friday, 7 August 2009, 2:02 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party">The Maori Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hon Tariana Turia</strong><br><strong>MP for Te Tai Hauauru</strong><br><strong>Co-Leader of the Maori Party</strong><br><strong>07 August 2009</strong> <strong>Media Statement</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Poroporoaki: Eru Potaka-Dewes</strong></p>
<p>The Maori Party has today expressed their sadness at the passing of Reverend Eru Potaka-Dewes of Ngati Porou, Ngati Uepohatu and Te Whanau-o-Pokai.</p>
<p>“Eru was widely read and loved nothing better than a vibrant debate on history, Treaty of Waitangi claims, education and rangatiratanga,” Maori Party co-leader Tariana Turia said.</p>
<p>“He has been a passionate commentator and scholar in the field of theological issues, particularly indigenous theology,” Maori Party co-leader Tariana Turia said.</p>
<p>Fellow co-leader Dr Pita Sharples said Eru’s contribution would be sorely missed.</p>
<p>“The combination of his dramatic talents, and his spiritual faith, made for a unique strength in hui. Whenever he rose to his feet he would make an enduring impression on the issue of the day – whether it be foreshore and seabed; Treaty claims or any of the vast areas of Maori political debate that he loved to contribute to.”</p>
<p>Waiariki MP Te Ururoa Flavell said Eru’s passion for defending Maori rights was reflected in the hundreds if not thousands of letters he wrote to local newspapers in Rotorua.</p>
<p>“Eru understood the power of the pen and he would apply it particularly in cases to defend Maori rights or bring a new and refreshing perspective to a debate.</p>
<p>“He and his wife Kiri were absolute troopers for our people and I thank Kiri, his children and mokopuna for sharing him with us.”</p>

Eru was also very widely known as an actor having appeared as Old Gobbo in the Maori Merchant of Venice as well as appearances in The Rainbow Warrior; Rapa Nui (produced by Kevin Costner), The Piano; Jubilee and a leading role in the Maori language drama, Tohunga.</p>
