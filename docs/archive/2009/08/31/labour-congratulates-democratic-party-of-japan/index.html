<p><strong>Monday, 31 August 2009, 11:23 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Chris Carter<br>Foreign Affairs Spokesperson</p>
<p>31 August 2009<br>Media Statement</p>
<p>Labour congratulates the Democratic Party of Japan on its decisive election victory</p>
<p>The Labour Party has congratulated the Democratic Party of Japan following their historic victory in yesterday’s Japanese general election.</p>
<p>“There are strong parallels between the DPJ’s progressive centre-left election programme and many of Labour’s positions,” Labour’s Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Chris Carter says.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party has pledged to stimulate the economy for growth, to extend greater benefits for working people and to strengthen the safety net for the sick and unemployed, and to improve ties with regional partners in Northern Asia.</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s relationship with Japan is very important,” Chris Carter says. “Japan is New Zealand&#39;s third largest export destination and our fourth largest trading partner overall. International visitors from Japan are important for our tourist industry. International students from Japan, and young people on the working holiday scheme, all help to build strong linkages between our countries.”</p>
<p>“Labour looks forward to working with the new Japanese government to further strengthen political, economic and social relations between New Zealand and Japan. Progressing the New Zealand-Japan Free Trade Agreement, initiated by the previous Labour-led Government, will be an important part of that programme,” says Chris Carter.</p>
