<p><strong>Friday, 28 August 2009, 12:20 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>28 August 2009 Media Statement<br>Government should take urgent action to save Centre<br>for New Zealand Studies</p>
<p>The Government must take urgent action to save the Centre for New Zealand Studies, Labour’s Foreign Affairs spokesperson Chris Carter says.</p>
<p>“I have been made aware that the centre, which is located at Birkbeck at the University of London, is expected to close on November 30 this year. This will result in New Zealand losing a centre that has been dedicated to promoting this country,” Chris Carter said.</p>
<p>“Since the centre opened in 2007 it has attracted more than 2000 visitors and has organised over 120 events focused on New Zealand.</p>
<p>“I have written to John Key asking that he makes urgent and strong representations to the University of London to keep the centre open.</p>
<p>“We should not sit silently by and let what is an enormous asset to New Zealand close.</p>
<p>“The previous Labour Government made a financial contribution to the Centre in recognition of the important role it played in promoting New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The centre houses an extensive collection of more than 6000 books and journals and holds copies of almost every New Zealand-made film. This is a significant resource and we must act to keep this collection of material intact,” Chris Carter said.</p>
<p><em>Letter Below</em></p>
<p>Hon John Key<br>Prime Minister<br>Office of the Prime Minister<br>9.030 Executive Wing<br>Parliament Buildings<br>WELLINGTON 6106</p>
<p>28 August 2009</p>
<p>Dear Prime Minister</p>
<p>I am writing to request that you take immediate action to save the Centre for New Zealand Studies which is located at the University of London’s Birkbeck College. My understanding is that Birkbeck College has informed Dr Ian Conrich, Director of the Centre, that the College will close the Centre by 30 November this year.</p>

<p>The Centre was an initiative of Sir Graeme Davies, the New Zealand born Vice-Chancellor of the University of London and was opened in February 2007. I visited the Centre in January 2008 in my capacity as Minister of Education and saw the enormous value of the Centre as a showcase for New Zealand arts, culture and academic achievement.</p>
<p>To date the Centre has organised 114 events, 5 conferences and 3 festivals focusing on New Zealand studies. My understanding is that all have been well attended and have helped raise New Zealand’s profile, particularly in academic and Arts circles. These events have been held not just in the UK but also in a number of other European countries.</p>
<p>The Centre has attracted over 2,000 visitors and researchers since it opened. Resources include over 6 000 books and journals, copies of nearly every film ever made in New Zealand and a huge range of music and other resources.</p>
<p>The previous Government recognised the value of the Centre as a showcase for our country and a contract was signed between the New Zealand Government and Birkbeck College to support the Centre. I would urge you to make strong representation to the University of London to keep the Centre open. The Centre for New Zealand Studies does a huge job in providing a small but distinct footprint, at minimal cost, for our country’s art, music and wider culture in Europe.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Hon Chris Carter<br>Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Ethnic Affairs<br>MP for Te Atatū</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
