<p>We beg to differ</p>
<p>Focus more on GST</p>
<p>The straight-shooting Cardinal</p>
<p>WE BEG TO DIFFER</p>
<p>It&#39;s important for minor parties that they don&#39;t get drowned out in</p>
<p>Parliament. Against this backdrop, disagreement over whether the new</p>
<p>Auckland Super City Council should have two separate Maori seats tested the</p>
<p>relationship between the National Party, the ACT Party and the Maori Party</p>
<p>this week. The conflict arose when ACT leader and Local Government</p>
<p>Minister, Rodney Hide, refused to sponsor the Super City legislation and to</p>
<p>resign his post if it contained a proposal for seats reserved exclusively</p>
<p>for Maori. Hide acted in accordance with ACT Party principle, which opposes</p>
<p>separate racial or ethnic representation. This is at odds with both the</p>
<p>Royal Commission&#39;s recommendations and the wishes of the Maori Party.</p>
<p>Hide&#39;s stance shows the dynamics of MMP government at work; in particular,</p>
<p>how smaller parties can--indeed must--take a different stand to others on</p>
<p>some major policy issues, even when they have an arrangement to work</p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>When National came to power it followed the precedent Labour had set,</p>
<p>negotiating quite flexible support agreements. These arrangements allow</p>
<p>senior MPs of minor parties, like Hide and Maori Party co-leader Dr Pita</p>
<p>Sharples, to hold ministerial positions but also to have the freedom to</p>
<p>Advertisement - scroll to continue reading</p>
<p>disagree with the Government on issues core to their values. Most of the</p>
<p>time, party positions are clear from the outset and when conflict arises</p>
<p>issues can be worked through to reach an agreeable compromise. However,</p>
<p>occasionally an issue like the Maori seats flares up, pitting party against</p>
<p>party, creating headaches for whoever is the Prime Minister as they have to</p>
<p>find a way through. This case was especially difficult for Prime Minister</p>
<p>John Key because two important support partners squared-off against each</p>
<p>other because of very distinct and cherished positions.</p>
<p>Smaller parties like ACT and the Maori Party actually depend on disagreeing</p>
<p>with the major parties and each other, to retain an independent identity.</p>
<p>It&#39;s their distinctive identity that differentiates them to voters when it</p>
<p>is time to go to the polls. When smaller parties actually get into power,</p>
<p>the job of &#39;brand differentiation&#39; is even more important since there is a</p>
<p>risk that being part of the Government causes them to lose their</p>
<p>distinctiveness. This may partly explain why Hide decided to take a stand</p>
<p>on the issue of the Maori seats. ACT&#39;s re-election rests on defending the</p>
<p>principles its voters supported, and on holding and increasing its share of</p>
<p>the vote. It can&#39;t afford to merge into National in the voters minds.</p>
<p>At the same time it is important that these parties keep their heads about</p>
<p>them. It is in the public interest that we have a stable government and</p>
<p>ultimately an MP&#39;s responsibility is not exclusively to their party but to</p>
<p>the good of the whole nation who they have been elected to represent.</p>
<p>Choosing when and how to dissent is a tension that must be carefully</p>
<p>handled. The political management of all this is difficult, but at the same</p>
<p>time we should respect parties like ACT and the Maori Party when they stand</p>
<p>on their principles, even as they seek to govern together.</p>
<p>FOCUS MORE ON GST</p>
<p>For a better tax system, change the tax mix. In other words, raising the</p>
<p>GST rate and lowering personal income and corporate taxes, would be good</p>
<p>for the economy and fairer too. It would also help to make New Zealand&#39;s</p>
<p>tax base--the sources of government revenue--more secure. On this subject,</p>
<p>a paper has been released by the Government-appointed Tax Working Group,</p>
<p>examining what the consequences might be of relying more on GST.</p>
<p>Research continually shows that high top marginal tax rates, like our 38</p>
<p>percent personal income tax rate, are damaging to economic growth. They cut</p>
<p>into people&#39;s and business&#39; incentives to save, invest, work or start an</p>
<p>enterprise, activities that will boost economic growth. For instance, many</p>
<p>wonder, what&#39;s the point in working harder and earning more, if that money</p>
<p>just disappears in tax? Unattractive tax rates are a serious problem right</p>
<p>now for New Zealand, with 24 percent of our skilled workforce overseas, and</p>
<p>foreign companies investing in places with lower tax rates, denying us</p>
<p>valuable capital in the credit-short market. Relying more on GST would</p>
<p>potentially help us to lower the taxes which are most harmful to growth.</p>
<p>GST is also fairer than our current personal income taxes, as it treats</p>
<p>everyone in the same way. Another major benefit of greater reliance on GST</p>
<p>is that it&#39;s difficult to avoid paying. At the moment, many people are</p>
<p>finding ways to side-step their personal income taxes by sheltering income</p>
<p>in trusts or companies. Paying your tax along with each purchase at the</p>
<p>check-out is much more difficult to avoid. We should take more advantage of</p>
<p>GST because it is a reliable revenue source.</p>
<p>One criticism that is made about raising GST is that it might hurt</p>
<p>low-income earners who would find themselves contributing to a bigger chunk</p>
<p>of the government&#39;s revenue than they currently are. While this cannot be</p>
<p>avoided, short-term inequalities could be partly addressed with cash</p>
<p>benefits. In the long-term it is likely that this would not pose a problem,</p>
<p>as over a lifetime GST is likely to collect the same proportion of tax from</p>
<p>the majority of people. For the sake of New Zealand long-term, the</p>
<p>Government should actively consider the Tax Working Group&#39;s recommendation</p>
<p>to rely more on GST.</p>

<p>THE STRAIGHT-SHOOTING CARDINAL</p>
<p>George Pell, the Cardinal Archbishop of Sydney, has a reputation as a</p>
<p>straight shooter. His collection of essays, God and Caesar, offers a series</p>
<p>of rigorous and sometimes elegant meditations on democracy, freedom,</p>
<p>society, social order and the role the Catholic Church can and should play</p>
<p>in the modern world. Fortified by a strong sense of history, Cardinal Pell</p>
<p>unites confidence in his own tradition with a suppleness of mind. He is</p>
<p>able to speak clearly and bravely to a twenty-first century that is</p>
<p>increasingly tormented and unstable.</p>
<p>Rather than promoting &#39;the absolute pursuit of the autonomy of the</p>
<p>individual,&#39; the Cardinal advocates for a more holistic view of democracy.</p>
<p>Quoting George Weigel, he points out that &#39;a genuinely human society</p>
<p>flourishes when people dedicate the exercise of their freedom to the</p>
<p>defence of others&#39; rights, and the pursuit of the common good, and when the</p>
<p>community supports individuals as they grow into fully mature humanity.&#39;</p>
<p>That is, democracy flourishes when it is directed to moral ends. People</p>
<p>flourish when they are attuned to transcendence, sacrifice, and the</p>
<p>challenges of moral order.</p>
<p>The book contains other gems on an array of subjects. Superbly literate,</p>
<p>historically aware, and above all, brave, Cardinal Pell lays down a tough,</p>
<p>unfashionable, and vital challenge--where to for democracy? Where are we</p>
<p>going? What provides the moral engine, the driving force behind our body</p>
<p>politic? Cardinal Pell puts his finger on tough questions that must be</p>
<p>answered. Drawing on the best of Catholic teaching, yet accessible to</p>
<p>people of goodwill everywhere, God and Caesar goes to the root of what it</p>
<p>means to be human--and how that is lived out in a democracy.</p>
