<p><strong>Friday, 28 August 2009, 11:51 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>28 August 2009</p>
<p>This has been an action-packed month for the Government, and we have been able to announce a few great initiates dedicating to creating more opportunities for all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>I am proud to be part of a Government that is keeping its promise to provide New Zealanders with a brighter future.</p>
<p>This month I&#39;ve had the opportunity to join the Minister for the Environment in releasing the environmental report into the Mapua site, confirming that it is now fit for residential, commercial and open space use.</p>
<p>The report is good news for the community of Mapua as it confirms that after two decades of debate and disruption and $12 million of work, the site is safe and fit for use.</p>
<p>I appreciated the opportunity to talk to many of you about what this meant for you and your families.</p>
<p>Further down the electorate I spoke with Enterprise Hokitika which represents Hokitika businesses.</p>
<p>There is a lot happening in Westland and Enterprise Hokitika is at the heart of these endeavors. We also had the benefit of Development West Coast CEO Dr John Chang&#39;s summary of the Trust&#39;s position and plans. The Trust continues to have a central role in promoting and developing our local West Coast economy, and I appreciate the hard work the trustees and staff put in.</p>
<p>During the last sitting week at Parliament I also had the company of local student Sam MacDonald. Sam got to experience firsthand what its like to be the MP for West Coast-Tasman.</p>
<p>Currently in his first year studying politics and commerce at the University of Canterbury, Sam assured me the experience has taught him a great deal. It was great for me to have him around as I&#39;m a strong believer in encouraging young people to dream big and follow their passions.</p>

<p>Youth Opportunities Package</p>
<p>Our young people are important. We want them to succeed. We want them to reach their full potential.</p>
<p>Yet, they are being particularly hard-hit by the global recession. 18- to 24-year-olds make up a third of those on the Unemployment Benefit. The number of young people who want a job but can&#39;t get one has more than quadrupled in the past year from 4000 to 17,000.</p>
<p>National is concerned that for young people starting out in their working lives, a long period of unemployment could be very damaging.</p>
<p>We can&#39;t afford to leave young people languishing on a benefit. This risks diminishing the potential of an entire generation of Kiwis.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why this month we announced our Youth Opportunities Package. It invests $152 million and aims to create up to 16,900 new opportunities for under 24-year-olds over the next 18 months.</p>
<p>The package includes nine initiatives designed to create opportunities for young people in work, education, and training.</p>
<p>Job Ops backs businesses that create work opportunities for young people. We are asking firms to provide up to 4000 young people with an entry-level job for at least six months. We will pay a $5000 wage subsidy for each placement.</p>
<p>Community Max invites local councils, mayors, community groups, and iwi to play a role creating up to 3000 work opportunities. We want community organisations to come to the Government with local projects that could employ young people and engage them in our communities. We will pay the minimum wage for 30 hours a week for up to six months, a training payment, and one supervisor for every four participants.</p>
<p>We are jump-starting our Youth Guarantee initiative. Some kids learn more from ripping an engine apart than studying Macbeth. Up to 2000 16- and 17-year-olds not engaged at school will get the opportunity to do fees-free training at polytechs, wänanga, and private training institutions.</p>
<p>Other initiatives in the package include extra training places for careers in the Defence Force, 1600 summer scholarships for university students, and 2500 new places in military-style training programmes. The package also includes up to 500 jobs for young people on National Cycleway projects, 600 new Industry Partnership training opportunities, and a funding boost for polytechs and technology institutes.</p>
<p>It&#39;s up to individual young people to make the most of these opportunities but we owe them a chance, and they owe us their best efforts in return.</p>
<p>By working with businesses and communities National is determined to secure a brighter future for young New Zealanders and our economy.</p>

<p>The youth of tomorrow are all important to me. As one of those youth, I hope my granddaughter gets the best possible opportunities.</p>
<p>Success for School Sport</p>
<p>Sport is really important for children. It&#39;s a great way to exercise and it teaches valuable teamwork, leadership and fair play skills.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why the National-led Government is committed to helping more children take part in organised sport at school, after school, and during the holidays. We want all Kiwi kids to have the opportunity to play sport.</p>
<p>Our Kiwisport initiative answers calls from schools, clubs, and regional sports trusts for greater support and investment in sport for children. It delivers $82 million over the next four years directly to the frontline. This funding comes from savings that have been identified in social marketing campaigns, websites and tagged funding programmes.</p>
<p>We believe it&#39;s better to invest money directly into schools and organisations helping to deliver sport. Kiwisport will see more children getting active and enjoying sport.</p>
<p>We&#39;re providing $45 million directly to schools around the country over the next four years. Each school will have the flexibility and freedom to spend the money in a way that ensures more of their pupils get access to sport without layers of bureaucracy and heavy-handed reporting.</p>
<p>The other $37 million will go into a regional partnership fund, which will be allocated across the 17 regional sports trusts around New Zealand. This will build stronger links between schools, sports clubs, and private sporting providers as they aim to give more kids the chance to play sport.</p>
<p>National is committed to increasing opportunities for children to get involved in sport.</p>
<p>Honouring our heroes</p>
<p>For those who have achieved, National wants to encourage good work in our communities and celebrate success.</p>
<p>Recognising service doesn&#39;t just acknowledge a person or what they have done, it helps build a culture of service and volunteering. It helps inspire others to make their own contribution. It helps make our communities stronger. That&#39;s why I&#39;m proud that we&#39;ve reinstated titular honours.</p>
<p>The titles will provide instant recognition and respect for those who hold them, and give people who have been touched by the recipients the chance to show appreciation for their hard work and dedication.</p>
<p>I&#39;m delighted that 72 out of 85 recipients of the Principal and Distinguished Companions of the New Zealand Order of Merit have decided to take the opportunity to be re-designated as Knights and Dames.</p>
