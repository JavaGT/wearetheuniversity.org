<p>Scholarships Just One Step In Furthering Choice In Education</p>
<p>Hon Heather Roy, ACT Deputy Leader </p>
<p>Friday, August 7 2009</p>
<p>ACT achieved a major milestone in our work to further school choice this week when, in my capacity as Associate Minister of Education, I announced a new scholarship initiative to enable 250 students from low socio-economic backgrounds to attend an independent secondary school that they and their families would previously not have been able to afford.</p>
<p>Furthering school choice is a key part of the ACT-National Confidence &amp; Supply Agreement.  ACT has always campaigned for school choice, and National has said it will:</p>
<p>&quot;work, over time, to increase the education choices available to parents and pupils so families have more freedom to select schooling options that best meet the individual needs of their children.&quot;</p>
<p>In pursuit of this, National and ACT have established the Inter-Party Working Group in School Choice to consider options for increasing parental and student choice in education.  I am chairing this project - along with members from the ACT, National and Maori Parties - and work is well underway.</p>
<p>The $2.6 million allocated to fund the scholarships is part of a $10 million increase to independent school funding in Budget 2009.  The remaining $7.4 million has been used to boost the Private School Subsidy and will be paid directly to independent schools.</p>
<p>This increase to the subsidy and the new scholarships are important steps toward honouring ACT and National&#39;s pledge to widen the education choices to students and their parents.  Under the scholarship initiative 150 students from low-income families will be able to go to an independent school in 2010, rising to 200 students in 2011, and 250 in 2012.</p>

<p>ACT and National in Government believe it is parents who are best placed to make the decisions around the education options that best suit their children&#39;s needs and require the freedom to make those choices.  Choice is key to ensuring quality education outcomes and giving our children and young people the opportunities they need to reach their potential.</p>
<p>This Government understands that independent schools play an important role in providing that freedom and those opportunities, and this latest funding increase is recognition of that.  It is also the first Government funding increase to independent schools since 2000, when it was capped by the then Labour Government.  Since then - due to inflation and increased student numbers - the sector has experienced a 42 percent real decrease in funding levels.</p>
<p>While the New Zealand Education Act 1877 created a national system of State schools, it made no provision to aid independent schools.  Over time, independent schools were provided with some goods and services supplied to State schools - eg school milk, free text books and access to advisory services - and in 1969 State resourcing was extended to include grants for operational expenses, furniture and equipment for new classrooms.  Overall State funding for independent schools, however, remained low.</p>
<p>Then, in 1970, the Government introduced a State subsidy amounting to a 20 percent subsidy of teachers&#39; salaries - and in 1975 passed the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act, increasing the subsidy to 50 percent of teacher salaries.  This was in addition to the other measures of assistance they had secured in 1969 and before.</p>
<p>In 1989, the Labour Government cut funding to zero - only for it to be restored to 20 percent in 1991 when National returned to office, and then capped by Labour in 2000.</p>
<p>Frequently overlooked - and ignored by critics of private schooling - is the fact that independent schools save the Government money.  Over four percent of school-age students - around 30,000 children - attend an independent school.  This saves the State around $200 million per annum - and relieves some of the pressure on State schools.</p>
<p>But parents who choose an independent school for their children have to pay twice - once through taxes, and again through school fees - placing this option out of the reach of many families.</p>
<p>While there are many high-quality State schools, there is no such thing as a ‘One Size Fits All&#39; education model to suit all children.  What works for one child may not work for another.  But families who cannot afford an independent school have no option but to accept the education offered by the State school closest to them - whether it works for their child or not.</p>
<p>This funding is a step toward giving parents that choice.  The Government knows parents are best placed to choose the education that suits their children&#39;s needs.  This funding will support parents in their choices and improve access for many families to a greater range of educational opportunities for their children.</p>
<p>Scholarships for 250 students from low-income families are just the beginning. They will considerably enhance the individual recipients&#39; educational opportunities.  But ACT aims for such choice and opportunity to be available to all students - not just those from better-off families or those fortunate enough to be awarded one of a limited number of scholarships.  We want every Kiwi kid to have the same choices.</p>
<p>Lest We Forget - Wellington Battalion Captures Chunuk Bair (August 8 1915)<br>The attack on Chunuk Bair on August 8, 1915 highlighted the leadership of Lt-Col William Malone and is still seen today as a high point of New Zealand&#39;s Gallipoli effort.</p>
<p>On August 6, the assault was undertaken by two columns of the New Zealand Infantry Brigade who were to meet at Rhododendron Spur and proceed to the summit.  It started well: the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and Maori Contingent cleared the way for the assault columns - but the attack was ordered before all infantrymen had reached the Spur.</p>
<p>The first attempt, made by the Auckland Battalion, failed.  Malone, commander of the Wellington Battalion, refused to sacrifice his men in a daylight attack - telling his superiors:</p>
<p>&quot;We are not taking orders from you people ... my men are not going to commit suicide.&quot;</p>
<p>Before dawn on August 8 1915, the Wellington Battalion made it to the summit.  Sunrise, however, brought a barrage of fire from the Turks on higher ground to the north and the Battalion spent the day in a desperate struggle to hold Chunuk Bair.</p>
<p>By the time it was reinforced by the Otago Battalion and the Wellington Mounted Rifles, the Battalion had lost around 690 men - including Malone, killed by a shell.<br>New Zealand held Chunuk Bair for two days - only for the relieving British battalions to lose it in a Turkish counter-attack.  A New Zealand memorial now stands on the summit.</p>
