<p>Tuesday, February 17, 2009<br>Canterbury plains irrigation battle inspires new design artwork</p>
<p>Questions such as &quot;is food the new oil?&quot;, &quot;what is furniture tourism?&quot; and &quot;can a fence be desirable?&quot; form the basis of an exhibition opening on Saturday profiling work done by the University’s Master of Design students.</p>
<p>Ten graduates from the College of Creative Arts will have designs exhibited from February 21 to March 6 in the Wellington campus Museum Building.</p>
<p>The exhibition represents the culmination of a year’s work for postgraduate students from a variety of design disciplines, including spatial, textile, digital, graphic, industrial and performance design.</p>
<p>“Our combined exhibition really shows the breadth of Massey’s design experience,” says Professor Dorita Hannah, head of postgraduate studies in the Institute of Design for Industry and the Environment. She says the students were challenged to undertake a “design inquiry” and present it as a written and visual thesis.</p>
<p>Dean Ivamy, with his exhibit Is food the new oil? (pictured), maps the controversial environmental footprint of the Canterbury central plains water irrigation scheme and presents statistics with graphics to illustrate the economic, financial and environmental implications of the expanding dairy industry.</p>
<p>Another graduate, Matt McKinley, re-energises the fence by using applied design research to develop an advanced permanent livestock electric fencing system for fencing pioneers Gallagher Animal Management.</p>

<p>Jane Apthorp, who describes herself as &quot;a confirmed design tourist&quot;, invites you to understand and imagine furniture in a whole new way through her drawn, made, written and photographed explorations.</p>
<p>The exhibition is itself designed by Massey researchers teaching in the design programmes, Annette O’Sullivan who lectures in graphic design with the Institute of Communication Design, and Stuart Foster who lectures in spatial design in the Institute of Design for Industry and Environment.</p>
<p>Professor Hannah said it was another example of the collaborative spirit which exists on the Massey campus.</p>
