<p>Lifting Our Game</p>
<p>Hon Rodney Hide, Minister of Local Government<br>Friday, February 20 2009</p>
<p>Speech to the Skyline Buildings Ltd distributors meeting; Hotel Grand Chancellor, Airport Oaks, Auckland Airport, Auckland; Friday, February 20 2009.<br>Good afternoon.</p>
<p>Since I became Minister of Local Government, and let it be known what changes I wanted to see in relation to Councils and the way they operate, I&#39;ve been flat out.</p>
<p>And so has my staff.</p>
<p>When I went on TVNZ&#39;s &#39;Close Up&#39; late last year, I asked viewers to write to me about the problems they&#39;d been having with their Councils.</p>
<p>I got literally a sackful of mail.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve had around 1,100 people letters so far, and more come in each day.</p>
<p>And everyone who wrote is getting a reply.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the extent of the problems<br>people are having with Councils.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure each of you has your own horror story - about spiralling costs, and<br>increasingly complicated and unnecessary demands for information before<br>granting a consent.</p>
<p>Which are driving up the costs of putting up a garage - and threatening your businesses&#39; viability, as well as driving ordinary Kiwis crazy.</p>
<p>I&#39;m in touch with many different companies and sectors about the costs of getting consents and the red tape involved.</p>
<p>Simply trying to carrying out their everyday business is now a nightmare.</p>
<p>It can cost $10,000 for a consent to put in a small cable car to help an old lady in Oriental Bay get up and down her steep cliff slope.</p>

<p>And nine months to get the consent.</p>
<p>I understand that just to put in a Para Pool in your backyard for the kids will take months to get the paperwork done, and can cost thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>That&#39;s just for the Council consent alone - which can cost up to 50 percent as much as the pool itself.</p>
<p>Families can&#39;t afford a Para Pool because of the Council costs - and if they do they may not get the consent through in time for a swim until next summer.</p>
<p>Earlier this week I visited a fantastic Hutt Valley business that makes the cable cars I referred to earlier.</p>
<p>It has 11 workers, it&#39;s very successful, very entrepreneurial and it exports.</p>
<p>But it&#39;s in trouble.</p>
<p>It&#39;s being driven into the ground by the increasing demands, and costs of, Council consents.</p>
<p>There are many companies like it.</p>
<p>Simply trying to carrying out their everyday business is now a nightmare.</p>
<p>The power that Council officials have accumulated is frightening.</p>
<p>They are now paranoid about the possibility of being considered - or found - negligent some time in the future about any decision they make on minor, as well as major, building projects.</p>
<p>It is appropriate that they&#39;re stringent and demanding in many areas involving safety and reliability of structures - to prevent leaky buildings for example.</p>
<p>And there should be a desire to continually improve our communities.</p>
<p>But it&#39;s gone too far.</p>
<p>It&#39;s all control freak behaviour, and it&#39;s got to stop.</p>
<p>I know there&#39;s a widespread problem - so what are we going to do about it?  What can we do about it?</p>
<p>We can make things easier, and we&#39;re going to.</p>
<p>I accept that much of the overbearing regulations and petty restrictions imposed by Councils come from government legislation such as the Resource Management and the Building Acts.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s why we&#39;re making changes to both.</p>
<p>The first changes to the RMA were announced earlier this month.</p>
<p>There will be more work on the RMA and related issues.</p>
<p>There have also been so many more new rules and regulations under the recent Labour Government - all of which meant more costs and more complexity.</p>
<p>No wonder people are giving up on projects like putting up a simple garage - and saying &quot;the hell with it.&quot;</p>
<p>The practice of imposing more and more obligations on Councils, which pass on the costs to ratepayers and consent applicants, must stop.</p>
<p>Another source of problems is the Building Act, and its regulations and requirements.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll be reviewing the Act in the future to make it less prescriptive and restrictive.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s not all.</p>
<p>We&#39;re also going to be sweeping through a whole raft of petty rules and regulations that are unnecessary, small minded and completely outdated, and affect things such as swimming pools.</p>
<p>That&#39;s one of my major goals in my role as Regulatory Reform Minister.</p>
<p>The Local Government Act is another piece of legislation we&#39;re targeting for improvements.</p>
<p>We want more transparency and accountability, and reduced costs passed on to local government because those costs are ultimately passed on.</p>
<p>However, although these pieces of legislation are responsible for the much of the absurdities, Councils themselves must bear part of the blame.</p>
<p>They have become very risk-averse and over zealous - particularly Council planners and the way they interpret legislation and extend the ridiculous controls into micro areas of a project.</p>
<p>In addition, costs and charges and fees keep being raised far beyond what is reasonable.</p>
<p>Three thousand dollars for a consent to build a $10,000 Skyline garage is absurd.<br>The paperwork&#39;s gone crazy too.</p>
<p>I&#39;m told up to 50 pages of paperwork is needed for Councils to approve a garage - whereas two or three used to be enough.</p>
<p>When ACT went into its support agreement with National after the election, I took on my two Ministerial portfolios: Local Government and Regulatory Reform ... because these are important areas that affect people and their communities in so many ways.</p>
<p>I also took them on because this is an area in real need of change.</p>
<p>Red tape is strangling businesses like Skyline, and it&#39;s driving ordinary people and homeowners crazy.</p>
<p>I want to see fewer of the absurd compliance demands in the regulatory area.</p>
<p>I want to see the financial burden placed by central government on local government reduced.</p>
<p>My view is that we should take Councils out of the picture and, for work on large building projects of any size, should hold the builder or tradesperson responsible.</p>
<p>If something should go wrong at some time in the future, whoever built it should bear the liability through their insurer.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: I accept Councils do a lot of good work, but they have become a block on growth in this country.</p>
<p>We are in a very tough situation economically and we must do everything we can to help businesses flourish and grow.<br>The country&#39;s got to go faster.</p>
<p>We need to lift our game substantially, and I believe there are very real gains to be made in the regulatory area.</p>
<p>Reform is needed, and change is going to come.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
