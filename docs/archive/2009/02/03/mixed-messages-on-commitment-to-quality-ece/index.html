<p>Mixed Messages On Commitment To Quality ECE</p>
<p>The union for early childhood and kindergarten teachers says the government is sending mixed messages over its commitment to improving the quality of early childhood education.</p>
<p>The Education Minister has announced a series of changes to early childhood policies.</p>
<p>NZEI, which represents thousands of teachers in early childhood centres and kindergartens, says on one hand the government is continuing to support the 20 Hours Free policy, but on the other, is not moving to lower ratios in some services as planned.</p>
<p>In terms of continuing the commitment to provide 20 hours free to all three and four year olds, NZEI Assistant National Secretary Peter Monteith says the government should be congratulated, despite removing the word ‘free’ and renaming the policy 20 Hours ECE.</p>
<p>He says there is no doubt the policy has made early childhood education more affordable and participation rates have been significantly boosted.</p>
<p>However NZEI believes that by not going ahead with dramatic improvements to teacher child ratios for children aged two to two and a half, the government is sending a worrying signal. The ratios were to drop from 1:15 or 1:10 to 1:5. The move was long overdue and came after long consultation with the sector.</p>
<p>The change was to take effect from July 1 this year, along with an improvement for sessional services, for older children where the ratio was to drop from 1:15 to 1:14.</p>

<p>“Any move to abandon the trend towards reducing ratios is a backward step and goes against best practice,” says Mr Monteith. “The differences may not sound like much, but the impact on quality education would be significant.”</p>
<p>NZEI would also urge the government to set up a planned national network of public early childhood education centres and continue efforts to produce more qualified early childhood teachers. The 20 Hours Free policy has further highlighted a shortage of quality early childhood services in many communities.</p>
<p>“Educational foundations need to be built in the early years and access to quality early childhood education is a critical factor,” says Mr Monteith.<br>ends  </p>
