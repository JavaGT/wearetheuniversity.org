<p><strong>Monday, 9 February 2009, 12:52 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Phil Goff<br>Leader of the Labour Party</p>
<p>9 February 2009 Media Statement<br>Labour offers support for Australians affected by fires</p>
<p>Labour leader Phil Goff has passed on to the Premier of Victoria, Hon John Brumby, and Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, his party’s sympathy and that of all New Zealanders for the tragic loss of life and property damage caused by the fires that have ravaged Victoria.</p>
<p>“There is enormous feeling by New Zealanders for those Australians whose lives have been devastated by the fires with the loss of more than 100 people and the destruction of homes and property,” Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>“I welcome the assistance being offered to Australia with our fire-fighters ready to go to work along side their Australian mates. That’s what good neighbours do.</p>
<p>“The close family and other ties we have with Australia means that at times like this, we will want to help in any way we can. Our hearts go out to those who have lost their loved ones and personal possessions,” Phil Goff said.</p>
