<p><strong>Wednesday, 4 February 2009, 3:47 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>4 February 2009<br>Media Statement</p>
<p>Trying to talk tough, but doing little to address student under-achievement</p>
<p>“Today’s announcement by Education Minister Anne Tolley that successful schools will be reviewed by ERO every 5 years while struggling schools will be reviewed more frequently, sends mixed messages.</p>
<p>This announcement contains much of what was already happening and does nothing to address the real causes of student under achievement,” said Labour’s Education Spokesperson Chris Carter.</p>
<p>Chris Carter noted that schools that have been identified as having student under- achievement, serious management or safety issues were already subject to more frequent interventions by ERO. In addition considerable work had already been done by ERO in moving successful schools towards greater self review.</p>
<p>“In the time I was Education Minister, schools with problems were already subject to more frequent reviews by ERO. Some were visited more than once in 18 months. There may be some merit in allowing ERO reviews to move from 3 to 5 years for perceived “successful” schools however there is a real danger that Mrs Tolley’s move may simply be about reducing ERO staffing.</p>
<p>In addition this action would seem counter to National’s stated aim of extending national standards in literacy and numeracy to all primary schools.</p>
<p>“The 3 yearly review is one way of assessing all schools against national benchmarks in curriculum delivery, school safety issues and property maintenance. This assessment helps ensure educational standards across all schools,” Chris Carter said.</p>

<p>“An ERO review is a quality assurance process for both parents and teachers. The report issued by ERO is a public document and provides a real opportunity for parents to have confidence that their child’s school is doing its job well.</p>
<p>The public would need to be assured that these will not be compromised by extending a school’s period of review. Labour hopes that any resources saved by reducing some school reviews will all go into support for struggling schools.</p>
<p>“Increasing the amount of time ERO spends in a struggling school will only be worthwhile if that intervention is coupled with resources and expertise that helps lift teacher effectiveness and addresses resource and property issues. Talking tough might be good short term politics but building a quality nationwide education system needs more than just tough talk.”</p>
