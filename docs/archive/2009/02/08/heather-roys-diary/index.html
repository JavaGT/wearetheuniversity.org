<p>Heather Roy&#39;s Diary</p>
<p>Welcome Back</p>
<p>Hon Heather Roy MP, ACT Deputy Leader<br>February 6 2009<br>Welcome back to Heather Roy&#39;s Diary for 2009. Following the summer break the Parliamentary year is about to start, with the House resuming on Tuesday February 10.</p>
<p>Over the summer there has been much discussion in the media - and, undoubtedly, over barbecues around the country - about matters of immediate importance and the hefty economic challenges before us. There will be more talk of job summits, infrastructure decisions and how best to weather the economical tidal wave as the year progresses.</p>
<p>Today, however, is a public holiday marking New Zealand&#39;s national day. To set the scene for the year it is an opportunity to look forward to our future as a nation culturally.</p>
<p>Where To For New Zealand?<br>It was disappointing to see the scuffle that erupted when Prime Minister John Key arrived at Waitangi yesterday only to be manhandled by a protester.</p>
<p>Waitangi Day has frequently been fraught with discord: former Prime Minister Helen Clark reduced to tears one year, while previous years saw former National Leader Don Brash splattered with mud, the Governor-General spat at, and Cabinet Ministers jostled.</p>
<p>Recent Waitangi Day celebrations, however, have seen signs of improved relations between Maori and non-Maori - perhaps, in part, due the much better representation of Maori interests in Parliament since the Maori Party was elected in 2005. Inclusion of the Maori Party, along with ACT, in government as Confidence and Supply partners to National must also have had an impact.</p>

<p>Waitangi Day this year is an opportunity to reflect on the future of New Zealand. The way in which we move forward as one people from a diverse range of backgrounds economically, socially and culturally will determine the type of country we pass on to our children. It&#39;s part of the legacy that we build; a journey towards peaceful nationhood. The passage won&#39;t always be harmonious - but the signs at least show hope.</p>
<p>As part of a series of familiarisation visits to Defence Force bases I have been undertaking, I was welcomed on to the Army Marae in Waiouru on Tuesday. There, I delivered my first mihi, before speaking to the soldiers present. I was mindful that where these soldiers had come from - their backgrounds and their skin colour - was irrelevant; I was being welcomed in my new capacity as Associate Minister of Defence, but also as one of them: part of the New Zealand Army family.</p>
<p>One thing I observed from my own time in the Army was that nowhere else have I come across the situation where people from all walks of life - those with differing socio-economic, educational and cultural backgrounds - come together for a common purpose and work towards a common goal. In my initial recruit intake we had people of Maori, European, Korean, South African, Chinese, French and Samoan descent. We were all there as Kiwi soldiers with the common purpose of serving our country.</p>
<p>This Waitangi Day, Kiwis could do much worse than look to the Defence Force for guidance on how we can all live as one people - mindful and respectful of our differences, but moving forward in one direction with tolerance for each other foremost in our minds. Our thoughts today should be on how we can each serve our country to leave a legacy for our children, not how our country can best serve each of our individual needs.</p>
<p>Lest We Forget - February 3, 1915<br>On February 3 1915, Private William Ham (Regimental Number 6/246 of the Canterbury Infantry Battalion) became the New Zealand Expeditionary Force&#39;s first casualty of the Great War during an operation to repel Turkish forces attacking the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>Ninety-four years later, the Army Museum at Waiouru chose this date on which to launch its new brand: &#39;National Army Museum Te Mata Toa&#39; (&#39;Through the Eyes of the Warrior&#39;). It also announced the re-naming of the museum to the National Army Museum.</p>
<p>The re-branding of the museum is part of an initiative to help build a national identity by honouring the sacrifice and courage of New Zealand soldiers and by telling their stories. With the museum having recently celebrated its 30th birthday, the new brand is seen as a way forward on the road toward fulfilling its vision: that of delivering an engaging visitor experience where the public can view the world from a soldier&#39;s perspective.</p>
<p>The circumstances around Private Ham&#39;s death began when Turkish forces attacked Toussum and Serapeum.</p>
<p>Two platoons of the 12th Nelson Regiment Company had taken up positions on the night of February 2 on the west bank of the canal at Serapeum. On their right was a battery of the Lancashire Artillery; on their left, the 62nd Punjabis Infantry. At 3:20am on February 3, heavy Turkish machine gun fire commenced to the north. The Punjabis Infantry was reinforced and prevented a party of Turks from crossing the canal. At this, the Turks retreated and entrenched on the eastern bank.</p>
<p>Under fire, they were unable to retreat and made three distinct attempts to cross the canal - all of which failed. The 62nd Punjabis counter-attacked around midday on February 3 and orders were received to close on the 22nd Brigade Headquarters. It was during this action that Private Ham was severely wounded, later succumbing to his wounds. One of seven brothers born in Ireland, William Ham is last known to have lived in Pokororo and worked as a sawmill accountant prior to World War I.</p>
