<p>Study Aims To Strengthen Ties Between Local Chinese And Non-Chinese Businesses In Auckland</p>
<p>Stronger links between Chinese and other businesses are among the anticipated outcomes of a just-launched Massey survey to find out how the Chinese do business in Auckland.</p>
<p>Chinese owners and operators from large and small businesses across a range of sectors are being invited to take part.</p>
<p>The study, in collaboration with the Asia New Zealand Foundation, was prompted out of concern that the fast-growing Chinese business community is little understood by other New Zealand business operators or policy makers. As a result, potential benefits to both are being lost, the researchers say.</p>
<p>Sociologist Professor Paul Spoonley, heading the study at Massey’s College of Humanities and Social Sciences in Albany, says he hopes information from the study will enable Chinese and non-Chinese businesses to better understand each other. This will be of mutual benefit in helping to grow and enhance business dealings across ethnic lines and in breaking down the prejudice that prohibits Chinese advancement, he says.</p>
<p>“We want to ask Chinese business owners and operators things like: What their business networks are like and how they work? How did they set up the business? Who did they get advice from? What sort of contacts did they have before deciding to go ahead and what kinds of things would it help them to know more about to succeed in business.”</p>
<p>One of the study&#39;s three researchers, sociologist Dr Carina Meares, says while many Aucklander are keen to embrace Chinese cultural events, such as the recent Lantern Festival, which attracted 150,000 people to Albert Park for Chinese New Year, many have little knowledge or appreciation of how the Chinese business community functions.</p>

<p>Professor Spoonley says the rapid growth of the Asian, and specifically Chinese, population in Auckland in recent years means there is a greater need for an understanding of Chinese business dynamics. “New Zealanders need to be more aware of this expansion, and of how Chinese people do business.”</p>
<p>Latest (2006) Census figures showed the number of Asians almost doubled to just over 350,000 since the previous census in 2001. Chinese make up just over 40 per cent of the New Zealand Asian population, two thirds of which live in Auckland.</p>
<p>Rain Qian, who came to New Zealand from China in 2002 and is a translator and researcher for the study team, urges Chinese businesspeople to participate in a one-hour interview in English or Mandarin.<br>Mr Qian, who has a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology and Economics (First Class Honours) from Massey, says individual information gathered in the will be completely confidential. “The more we know, the more we will be able to help Chinese people,” he says.</p>
<p>Andrew Butcher, Director of Policy and Research for the Asia New Zealand Foundation, says the study will help New Zealanders to be better informed about the workings of the Chinese business community and pave the way for improved business networks. Results of the study will be released in the middle of the year.</p>
