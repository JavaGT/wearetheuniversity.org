<p>New journalism scholarship announced</p>
<p>AUT University and community newspaper Indian Newslink have launched a journalism scholarship in a bid to boost the standard and practice of the profession.</p>
<p>Indian Newslink will pay the tuition fee, Student Services Fee and Student Association Fee for one student admitted every year into one of the university’s one-year postgraduate programmes, including the postgraduate diploma in Communication Studies (journalism) and the Bachelor of Communication Studies (Hons).</p>
<p>The programme, open to all New Zealand citizens and permanent residents, is aimed at creating a new generation of quality journalists and foster professional standards of journalism in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Indian Newslink publisher Ravin Lal says, as a community newspaper entering its 10th year the publication wanted to “give something back to the community”.</p>
<p>He says because of the Indian community’s strong interest in education, the topic has been always been a focus of the newspaper.</p>
<p>AUT University vice-chancellor Derek McCormack says the university is thrilled to have a partnership with Indian Newslink.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a really strong initiative to support us with this scholarship and hope that the rest of the news media will take note and follow their lead.”</p>
<p>The first scholarship will be awarded this year, for the 2010 intake.</p>
