<p>Press release<br>Victoria University Press<br>19 February 2009<br>immediate</p>
<p>Bridget van der Zijpp’s novel Misconduct has been shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers’ Best First Book Prize, South East Asia and the Pacific region.</p>
<p>Victoria University Press publisher Fergus Barrowman says, “I’m delighted that Misconduct is getting the recognition it deserves, way to go Bridget.”</p>
<p>Margie Thomson writing in NEXT magazine on publication said, “Bridget van der Zijpp is a new name in local fiction, but if this novel is anything to go by, we&#39;ll be hearing a lot more about her. Misconduct is intelligent, contemporary women&#39;s fiction, wonderfully assured and quietly compelling.” Misconduct was also named one of the Listener&#39;s Books of the Year.</p>
<p>The book’s shortlisting has seen immediate interest from overseas publishers seeking to acquire rights.</p>
<p>The regional winners from each of the shortlists (Africa, Canada and Caribbean, Europe and South Asia, South East Asia and the Pacific) will be announced on 11 March 2009. These winners will compete for the overall Best Book and Best First Book award, announced on 16 May at the Auckland Writers&#39; and Readers Festival.</p>
<p>About Bridget<br>After a very successful 10 year career in radio Bridget moved to Wellington and gained an MA in Creative Writing. During her studies she began work on her debut novel Misconduct, published in April 2008. While completing Misconduct Bridget also worked as a publicist/marketer in Wellington. Her projects included Douglas Wright’s tour of Black Milk, Cuba St Carnival, and past Wellington International Jazz Festivals. Last December she was appointed to the board of Arts Wellington, the Wellington Regional Arts and Cultural Development Board.</p>
<p>About the book<br>Misconduct is a moving novel about the possibility of reinvention, the sweet and sour taste of revenge, and a woman’s search for friendship and love.</p>
<p>Misconduct is set in a beach town, and while the setting is not specified Bridget says a childhood spent on Northland beaches like Glinks Gully, Waipu Cove, Bayleys Beach and Mangawhai Heads was highly influential.</p>
