<p>National&#39;s tenancy law changes unfair and poorly timed</p>
<p>National&#39;s plans to reverse changes to residential tenancy laws show a<br>lack of balance and very poor timing.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s odd that at a time when more and more people are entering the<br>rental property market the Government should decide to remove reforms<br>aimed at redressing some of the power imbalance between landlords and<br>tenants,&quot; Green Party Housing Spokesperson Sue Bradford said.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, Housing Minister Phil Heatley has said that National<br>opposes the payment of professional tenant advocates at Tenancy Tribunal<br>hearings, will not cap tenant liability for damage that is not their<br>fault, and will reverse a change that would have banned real estate<br>agents from charging letting fees to tenants.</p>
<p>The Green Party supported all these reforms when Labour announced them<br>last year, and it is disappointing that National has decided not to go<br>ahead with them when it brings the Residential Tenancies Bill (No 2)<br>back to Parliament shortly, Ms Bradford said.</p>
<p>&quot;National talks a lot about fairness and balance, but what&#39;s fair about<br>removing measures that bring a lot more balance into the system?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who bears financial responsibility for damages can be a contentious<br>issue as a group of Dunedin students found out in a case where they were<br>all held liable for a kitchen fire accidentally started by only one of<br>them.</p>
<p>&quot;Corporate landlords are likely to be represented at Tribunal hearings<br>by a tenancy manager advocate who knows the legislation well and is a<br>trained professional, while tenants with no knowledge of the law, and<br>who often have language or literacy difficulties, have to represent<br>themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;This issue affects many New Zealanders as there were 24,297 tenancy<br>tribunal hearings held in the 2006/2007 years.</p>
<p>&quot;And many tenants just give up and don&#39;t even attend hearings.</p>
<p>&quot;The playing field would be a lot more level if the tenants could access<br>professional advocacy help at hearings.&quot;</p>
