<p>Media Release 27 February 2009</p>
<p>Universities Commit Support To Economic Recovery</p>
<p>Today’s Job Summit is supported by universities which intend to utilise their expertise in working with the new government to assist economic recovery.</p>
<p>University leaders have given that commitment to Tertiary Education Minister Anne Tolley and two Vice-Chancellors are attending the summit representing a sector which educates the professional workforce through research-led teaching.</p>
<p>Professor Roger Field who chairs the universities’ representative body, the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’ Committee, says it is these professionals who have the necessary skills to assist and create innovative enterprises based on the application of research and new knowledge.</p>
<p>“Public investment in key areas of the university system will help to address skill shortages in the professional workforce. Universities are a vital part of New Zealand’s infrastructure and provide the bulk of its basic research capability.</p>
<p>“A programme of progressive investment in New Zealand’s eight universities would ensure that the human and intellectual capital contained within the system is fully utilised for the country’s benefit. Universities not only train the researchers and professionals of the future but are also at the forefront of research commercialisation. The New Zealand university system represents a tremendous resource for assisting the country out of recession.”</p>
