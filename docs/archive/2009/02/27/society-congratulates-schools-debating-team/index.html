<p>For immediate release</p>
<p>Victoria University Debating Society congratulates New Zealand Schools’ Debating Team.</p>
<p>The Victoria University of Wellington last night unanimously passed a motion of congratulations to the Russell McVeagh New Zealand Schools’ Debating Team, winners of World Schools’ Debating Championships.</p>
<p>New Zealand defeated England by 6-1 in the Grand Final, avenging a narrow 5-4 loss in the Grand Final of the 2008 Championships.</p>
<p>It is the first time New Zealand has won the Championships since 1995.</p>
<p>Polly Higbee, President of the Debating Society, said that there was a close link between schools debating and university debating. &quot;Most top schools debaters go on to be very successful debaters at university, and later become coaches and adjudicators&quot;, said Ms Higbee.</p>
<p>&quot;Five members of the current Debating Society executive had been members of the New Zealand Schools’ Debating Team when at secondary school&quot;, she said.</p>
<p>Kevin Moar, one of the coaches of the New Zealand team, is a life member of the Debating Society, and many Debating Society members had assisted the team by debating against them in the lead-up to the tournament.</p>
<p>Stephen Whittington of the Debating Society said that secondary school debaters contemplating debating at university should enrol at Victoria University.</p>
<p>&quot;Vic is the most successful debating society in New Zealand. We have won the New Zealand Universities’ Impromptu Debating Championships for the last ten years running, the Joynt Scroll for the last three, and are ranked in the top 25 universities in the world. Vic is where debating is at!&quot; he mused.</p>
