<p><strong>Children Will Be Ultimate Losers From Teacher Advisory Service Cuts</strong></p>
<p>The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa says students will be the ultimate losers from cuts to professional advice and support services for teachers.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education is cutting funding for professional support services in the specialist areas of PE, art and science, saying the professional support schools get must focus on reading, writing and mathematics and the implementation of National Standards.</p>
<p>NZEI says the school support services are invaluable, with advisors working with teachers to build their knowledge and competence in specialist areas of the curriculum.</p>
<p>NZEI President Frances Nelson says not having professional advice and support in subjects other than literacy, numeracy and National Standards is a big blow for teachers and schools, and will impact on student learning.</p>
<p>“If teachers don’t feel confident and knowledgeable in teaching science or the arts for example, because they haven’t access to any professional help to do so, they’ll be reluctant to teach it or won’t teach it in the most effective way. What that really means is that students will miss out on a well-rounded curriculum giving them broader educational opportunities,” she says.</p>
<p>The Minister of Education has said that the government may change the learning focus from year to year.</p>
<p>“That is totally impractical,” says Frances Nelson.</p>
<p>“Reinstating those services once they’ve been lost is no easy task. Advisors in the specialist areas which are being cut will leave and won’t easily be replaced to meet a changed government focus. We’ll face a shortage of expert advice and guidance in key curriculum areas once this service is disbanded.”</p>
<p>The other concern is that schools which do want to continue accessing professional development for other curriculum areas, will have no option but to fund it out of their already- stretched operations grant funding.</p>
