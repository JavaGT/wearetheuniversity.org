<p>Food regulator should seek more information before approving GM soybeans DP-305423-1</p>
<p>The Centre for Integrated Research in Biosafety (INBI) has made two submissions to Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) on their draft recommendation to approve the use of genetically engineered high oleic acid soybeans as human food.</p>
<p>The centre’s Director, Professor Jack Heinemann, says information contained in the Assessment Report is insufficient. Prof. Heinemann was the lead author of one of the submissions.<br>“FSANZ ignored the costs to consumers who are attempting to avoid the exposure to this material even when it is properly labelled. In doing so, they have probably significantly overstated benefits and understated consumer costs.”</p>
<p>The INBI team evaluating the FSANZ assessment of application A1018 high oleic acid soybean DP-305423-1 found insufficient information to conclude that this variety of soybean was as safe as conventional soybeans. Heinemann also pointed out that FSANZ had observed potential adverse effects feeding animals other high oleic acid soybeans from the same manufacturer after the soybeans were cooked at temperatures that are similar to how humans would eat soybeans. “Neither in this assessment nor in the previous had those observations been followed up or properly explained” said Prof. Heinemann.</p>
<p>Dr. Brigitta Kurenbach, lead author on the other of the Centre’s submissions, found that key safety tests, particularly characterisation of DNA inserts at undisclosed locations in the genome, and likely new derivative gene products, apparently were not conducted. According to Kurenbach, “what was used as test and control material for all of the different assays was ambiguous and haphazard, making it impossible at this time to have confidence that all potential unintended or unanticipated hazards had been identified for assessment”.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Assessment report was silent on the possible effects of breathing in soy flour dust, an important pathway to causing potential allergic reactions. Thus the Centre’s researchers were unable to conclude on the available information that high oleic acid soybean DP-305423-1 was as safe as conventional soybean in the range of preparations that are unique to or inseparable from their use as human food.</p>
<p>In addition, INBI has a general concern about the costs passed on to the public wishing to exercise their statutory right to engage in the assessment process. The charges applied by FSANZ to access the scientific dossier of GM applications are prohibitive and prevent full and open consultation at least with this public Centre, and they believe with the public in general.<br>INBI is an independent research centre based at the University of Canterbury that is dedicated to public good research and assessment of the potential harms and benefits of genetically modified organisms. INBI in partnership with GenØk – Centre for Biosafety (Norway) and Third World Network (Malaysia) produced the Biosafety Assessment Tool (BAT), a free online resource for citizens, regulators and researchers wishing to conduct their own safety assessments (<a href="https://bat.genok.org/bat/">https://bat.genok.org/bat/</a>). The Centre’s evaluations of the Assessment Report are available for download from <a href="http://www.inbi.canterbury.ac.nz">www.inbi.canterbury.ac.nz</a>.</p>
