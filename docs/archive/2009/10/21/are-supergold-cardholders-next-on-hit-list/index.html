<p><strong>Wednesday, 21 October 2009, 3:14 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Are SuperGold cardholders next on Joyce’s hit list?</strong></p>
<p>Reports that some councils are being underfunded to supply travel to SuperGold cardholders should be a concern for over half a million Kiwis who hold one, Labour’s Transport spokesperson Darren Hughes said today.</p>
<p>“I am worried that uncertainty around the funding for free off-peak travel for cardholders could lead to confusion for those who now rely on the travel as part of their everyday lives,” Darren Hughes said.</p>
<p>“At least one council has gone public about a ‘significant shortfall’ in its funding from the New Zealand Transport Agency which enables it to provide over 65s their free off peak travel.</p>
<p>“It would be a real worry if this became a trend around New Zealand. Otago Regional Council claims it only has enough funding to make it to March 2010.</p>
<p>“So what is going on here? Is Transport Minister Steven Joyce now pulling money out of travel for Superannuitants to feed his hunger for large roading projects in the main centres?”</p>
<p>“Councils admit they’re facing real challenges here but the status quo must remain. Yes, these are difficult times, but a pillar of being part of a civilised society is looking after the elderly.  </p>
<p>“Steven Joyce needs to end the confusion. Will councils be 100% funded to provide SuperGold cardholders with the travel they now rely on? If not, will cardholders lose some of the current entitlement?</p>
<p>“Are councils going to be forced to make up any shortfall? And if so, what other services will be cut, or will ratepayers face increased bills?”</p>
<p>Darren Hughes said he will be keeping a close eye on this situation to ensure the over 65s are not robbed of what is now a very important service for them.</p>
<p>“The prospect of losing the ability to meet family, go shopping and travel to healthcare at no cost would impose a massive burden on them.”</p>
