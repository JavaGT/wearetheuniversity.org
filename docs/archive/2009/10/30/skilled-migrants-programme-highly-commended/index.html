<p>Skilled Migrants’ Programme wins Highly Commended in national EEO Trust Awards</p>
<p>A programme devised by Victoria University of Wellington to help skilled migrants get work won an EEO Trust Award last night.</p>
<p>The Workplace Communication for Skilled Migrants’ Programme won ‘Highly Commended’ in the Tomorrow’s Workforce Award category of the EEO Trust Work &amp; Life Awards 2009.</p>
<p>In handing out the award one of the programme participants Filipino Rodolfo Divino was quoted: “No one can exactly tell the profound positive impact of this course both mentally and emotionally, except those who were the product of this programme—us.”</p>
<p>The Skilled Migrants’ Programme helps tertiary-educated, experienced immigrants gain workplace experience, develop skills and confidence in job-seeking, and learn communication skills appropriate for New Zealand workplaces.</p>
<p>Participants come from a variety of professional backgrounds including law, accounting, medicine, engineering, finance, banking, information technology and education.</p>
<p>Economic assessments show that the programme returns $98 to the New Zealand economy for every dollar spent.</p>
<p>Programme designer and coordinator Nicky Riddiford said: “The EEO Trust Award is a wonderful recognition of the work done here and with our business and community partners in making a difference for people and the community.</p>
<p>“This programme benefits the migrants and their families, of course. It equally benefits the New Zealand community and workplaces, by ensuring a speedy and positive entry into productive work.”</p>

<p>“The economic benefits are substantial,” said Victoria’s Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences, Professor Deborah Willis.</p>
<p>“Cost/benefit analysis shows that the programme returns $98 to the New Zealand economy for every dollar spent. The benefits are so high because they last for a graduate’s whole career. We conservatively estimate a productivity improvement of $30,000 per graduate per year of employment in 2009 values.</p>
<p>“There are also savings in unemployment benefits and participants gain self-esteem in being able to share their professional skills, often in areas where there is a skill shortage.”</p>
<p>The programme relies upon in-class teaching of six weeks, workplace experience of six weeks and mentoring from business people</p>
<p>Internships and mentoring have been strongly supported by the Rotary Club of Wellington and recruitment agency The Johnson Group.</p>
<p>Leigh Johnson, Director of The Johnson Group said: &quot;As a recruitment agency, we&#39;re in an ideal position to help change some of the attitudes that make it so difficult for skilled migrants to find appropriate, meaningful work in New Zealand. The Johnson Group&#39;s consultants very much value working on the Skilled Migrant Programme. It&#39;s marvellous that our work on placing interns has such a dramatic and positive effect on our clients&#39; lives and careers.&quot;</p>
<p>Stephen Brown, President of the Rotary Club of Wellington said: “Our members and some of their partners are huge supporters of this programme because it makes a real and visible difference to people, families and communities. It is a very rewarding two-way street, and so more members sign up each year to become mentors or offer internships. Long may it continue.”</p>
<p>The programme received special commendation from the New Zealand Human Rights Commission in June 2009.</p>
