<p><strong>MBA students visit China</strong></p>
<p>A group of MBA students leave for China next Thursday for a study tour.</p>
<p>About 20 students and staff will spend 10 days in the cities of Shanghai and Suzhou assessing economic growth in the manufacturing and service sectors and experiencing the significant influence Chinese culture has on the way business is conducted.</p>
<p>Dr David Tweed and Dr Jonathan Matheny, who are leading the trip, say they chose China because it will contribute significantly to the students’ understanding of the global economy and ability to succeed in it.</p>
<p>“We recognise that many of our graduates will work in an international context, where they won’t necessarily be familiar with the language or culture,&quot; Dr Tweed says. &quot;Jonathan and I are passionate about exposing our emerging senior generalist leaders to experiences that will help shape their thinking and behaviour in a globalised world.”</p>
<p>The students will meet a range of business people, work in groups on a strategic exercise with companies such as Goodyear Tyres, and take part in presentations and lectures. One of these is by Foong Wai Fong, executive director of The GEM Group and author of the bestselling book Megatrends Asia. The students will also have a joint lecture with Nanjing University MBA students.</p>
<p>“We have selected businesses that our people would have some affinity with; for example everyone buys tyres for their cars in New Zealand, they just don’t realise that the majority of them are manufactured in Asia, where Goodyear employs 30,000 people,&quot; Dr Tweed says. &quot;The experience of working with Goodyear, Inventec and GEM Corporation will enable the students to translate strategy into the real world.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr Tweed has strong ties with China. He has taught MBA classes in Shenzhen and Guangdong on three visits since 2000. He has also spent time at Beijing Language and Culture University learning Mandarin as well as cultivating university and business contacts to support the College of Business strategy to develop mutually beneficial international relationships.</p>
<p>He says the visits have given him a greater understanding of the Chinese culture, which is crucial to doing business. “Chinese people expect to mix business and pleasure to a much greater extent than we do. They like to get to know you personally, teach you about their history and culture, and find out about yours. They would be very offended if you only wanted to do business with them on a contractual basis.”</p>
<p>Annual overseas study tours are to become a regular part of the MBA programme, which is New Zealand&#39;s longest-running. There are more than 2000 Massey MBA alumni active in business worldwide.</p>
