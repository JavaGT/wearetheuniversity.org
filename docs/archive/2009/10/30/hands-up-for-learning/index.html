<p>30 October 2009 Media Statement<br>Hands Up for Learning</p>
<p>Labour Leader Phil Goff joined in World Teachers Day at May Road Primary School in his Mt Roskill Electorate today.</p>
<p>World Teachers Day celebrates the value of teaching and learning, with thousands of teachers, students, children and parents joining in a synchronised action at 12.30 pm putting their ‘Hands Up for Learning’.</p>
<p>“World Teachers Day enables us to celebrate the power of education and the importance of learning”, Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>“Education is about developing children’s learning and thinking skills. That’s fundamental to building a strong and healthy society.</p>
<p>“It’s about creating the skills that we need for all New Zealanders to participate as productive and engaged members of our community. Education is the foundation for a strong democracy, a cohesive society and a vibrant economy,” Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>“Teachers play a critical role in this. Years after we have left school, we remember the teachers who made a difference in our learning and our lives.</p>
<p>“No profession has a greater importance in enabling all our children to develop to their full potential. People are our greatest resource and we simply cannot afford not to create the opportunity through education for every kiwi to make the strongest contribution that they are capable of to their community and the economy.</p>
<p>“Nor we should we forget that learning is a life-time process. In this regard, the decimation of night classes and the end of a century long tradition and availability of night classes is an avoidable tragedy for our community. It is still not too late for the government to reconsider the stupidity of this action.</p>
<p>“World Teachers Day is a chance for us to acknowledge and thank teachers, principals, support staff and parents for the contribution they all make to our children’s education and to building a better New Zealand,” Phil Goff said.</p>
