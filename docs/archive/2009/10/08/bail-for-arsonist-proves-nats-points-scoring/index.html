<p>Clayton Cosgrove<br><strong>Law and Order Spokesperson</strong><br><strong>MP for Waimakariri</strong></p>
<p>8 October 2009 <strong>Media Statement</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bail for arsonist proves National’s policies were simply about points-scoring</strong></p>
<p>The bailing of a self-confessed arsonist back to the same block of council flats where he lit five separate fires proves what a farce the Government’s bail changes have been, says Labour law and order spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
<p>Clayton Cosgrove said Prime Minister John Key campaigned for changes to the 2007 Bail Act because National <em>“believes protection of the public should be the most important consideration”</em> (media statement, 1 February, 2008).</p>
<p>“So what does John Key now say to the tenants of the other council flats?” Clayton Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“How does he reassure them that their protection was the prime motivation for National’s bail changes when the man who has admitted setting fire to their flats, terrifying them and causing thousands of dollars of damage, is now back in their midst?</p>
<p>“National’s bail changes, like many of their tough on crime policies, were far more about rhetoric and scoring political points than they ever were about substance,” Clayton Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“Under the old law that National repealed the court would have had to consider whether there was a real and significant risk that the offender might abscond, interfere with witnesses or evidence, or offend while on bail.</p>
<p>“Without commenting on the likelihood of this individual doing any of those things, it’s difficult to imagine that he would have been remanded on bail under the old law.”</p>
<p>Clayton Cosgrove said Labour had not opposed National’s bail changes --- “not because Labour thought they were worthwhile, but because we thought they were so trivial that it was not worth wasting parliamentary time on them by prolonging debate.</p>
<p>“The changes were flim flam at best. At worst, as seems to be the case here, they do nothing to create public reassurance at all.”</p>
