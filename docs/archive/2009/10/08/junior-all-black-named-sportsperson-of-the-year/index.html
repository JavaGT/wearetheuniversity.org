<p> <br>Junior All Black named sportsperson of the year</p>
<p>Victor Vito is to be named Sportsperson of the Year at the Victoria University of Wellington Blues Awards tonight. In 2008 and 2009 Vito played for the Wellington Lions and in 2009 became a Wellington Hurricane and a Junior All Black. Vito has been a student at Victoria since 2005.</p>
<p>“I am delighted that an athlete of the quality of Victor will join the ranks of winners of this prestigious award. It demonstrates that students can combine competing at the highest level with academic study,” said Jasmine Freemantle, President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA).</p>
<p>The Blues are the highest recognition the University can give to people who have, by their sporting achievements or contribution to sport, brought credit to the institution. They are awarded by the VUWSA on the recommendation of the Blues Panel, which consists of representatives of the Victoria University Sports Council and appointed members who are highly respected in the Wellington sports industry.</p>
<p>Former winners include All Blacks Graham Mourie, Jerry Collins and Conrad Smith, five-times World Mountain Running Champ Jonathan Wyatt, and Black Stick Suzie Pearce. Twenty three students will receive sports Blues and two students will receive sports administration Blues. The Sportsperson of the Year award will be presented by rugby league legend Ruben Wiki. The Awards will be held at the Kosmos Greek Taverna, 12 Pirie Street at 6.30pm.</p>
