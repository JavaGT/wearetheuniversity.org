<p>Top Albany student-athletes named</p>
<p>A sailor and a weightlifter have won top honours at the Blues Sports Awards Dinner at the Albany campus.</p>
<p>Sailor Sam Meech was awarded Albany’s sportsman of the year, while Chantal Lambrechs received the sportswoman of the year award.</p>
<p>Blues were also given out to 24 other student-athletes at the dinner held at the Sir Neil Waters Lecture Theatres building on Monday night.</p>
<p>Ms Lambrechs competed at the national age group championships in September last year, placing first in the under-75kg women’s event, breaking the national record. Her record breaking continued at the Auckland championships in June where she won first place in the under-75kg women’s event. She competed in the New Zealand team at the Youth Commonwealth Games in India placing third in the under-69kg women’s event.</p>
<p>Mr Meech is a gold medallist and junior world champion in the Laser Radial class. He placed first in the Laser Radial national championships in July and was a member of the national team that competed at the world youth championships in Brazil, also in July this year.</p>
<p>The eighteen-year-old moved to Auckland from Tauranga a year ago to study Sports Business Management at Massey and to train with the Murray’s Bay Sailing Club on the North Shore. Mr Meech, who grew up on a boat sailing between New Zealand and Britain with his parents and younger sister, says being named sportsman of the year is “pretty cool. I wasn’t expecting it.”</p>

<p>Ms Lambrechs, 19, migrated to Auckland’s North Shore from South Africa ten years ago. She took up weightlifting five years ago after her older sister began training and competing. The first year Bachelor of Science student says weightlifting is a great sport for women as well as men, and requires as much mental as physical strength.</p>
<p>Blues will be awarded to students from the Wellington and Manawatu campuses at a dinner in Palmerston North tonight.</p>
