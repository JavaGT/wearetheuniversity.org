<p>7 October 2009<br>Media Statement</p>
<p>True carnage of Tolley’s cuts finally exposed</p>
<p>Three in every four schools providing adult and community education night classes will lose their funding next year following the Government’s savage Budget cuts, says Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Maryan Street.</p>
<p>“The true carnage of Education Minister Anne Tolley’s 80 per cent cuts has finally been revealed by the Tertiary Education Commission which appears to have dumped the information into the public arena through a little-circulated media statement released on Saturday.</p>
<p>“This highly irregular timing and the Minister’s accompanying silence is no surprise. It highlights just how unpopular the move is and now the cold hard facts<br>are finally being revealed public anger will only grow,” Maryan Street says.</p>
<p>“TEC has confirmed that just 50 of the 212 schools now providing adult and community education (ACE) night classes will get funding next year.</p>
<p>“It has also confirmed the funding will cover courses for just 25,000 adults. There are currently over 220,000 people enrolled in ACE course around the country.<br>That’s up to 180,000 adult learners who could now miss out.</p>
<p>“Whilst schools which get no funding could technically run their own user-pays courses, it is anticipated few will actually be able to do so without Government support. Schools in lower income areas are particularly unlikely to be able to afford it. Those in the Hutt Valley and West Coast have already decided against offering any ACE courses.</p>

<p>“So much for supporting adult New Zealanders to improve their education. The Government claims its focus is on young New Zealanders – yet short-sightedly ignores the fact that when a parent improves his or her education, they improve the educational prospects of their children at the same time.</p>
<p>“Night classes have provided a vehicle for many New Zealanders to lift themselves and their families up by their bootstraps. Anne Tolley has taken this opportunity to upskill away,” Maryan Street says.</p>
<p>“She also needs to explain how groups providing vital community services like Citizens Advice Bureaux, Parent Help Lines, Youth Line, Women’s Refuges, Budgeting Services and many others, who used the courses to train volunteers, will be funded in future. Or are these unnecessary hobbies as well?”</p>
