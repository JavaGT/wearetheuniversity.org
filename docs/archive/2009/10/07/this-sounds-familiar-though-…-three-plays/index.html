<p>This Sounds Familiar Though…<br>-Three Plays</p>
<p>Media Release</p>
<p>This Sounds Familiar Though... promises to take audiences at Studio 77 on a journey as familiar as it is unfamiliar.</p>
<p>The final season of a series of short plays that showcase the talents of upandcoming directors from Victoria University’s Theatre programme, encapsulates the trifling details of everyday life.</p>
<p>Each of the three plays explores the realms between meaning, truth, action and reality and invites the audience to take something familiar from unfamiliar worlds.</p>
<p>Opening the season is Counting the Ways by Edward Albee.</p>
<p>Director Daniel Brown says the beautifully written play explores the potent poignancy of a wilting relationship, reminiscing with the desire for a fairytale happy ending.</p>
<p>“We’re human and yet we try to attain these perfect fairytale relationships. We are all taking part in the same bizarre ritual, creating characters in order to engage with each other. In an all too familiar way at some point reality silently sneaks in,” says Mr Brown.</p>
<p>La Calle de la Gran Ocasión – Dialogues by Mexican playwright Luisa Josefina Hernández, is the second play of the evening. Each of the three dialogues that make up the play capture fleeting but profound moments of fulfilment, happiness, and sensuality.</p>
<p>“It is in search of these things; through pain and manipulation, care and love that we begin to form revelations of the human situation,” says director Laura Velvin.</p>
<p>Finishing off the performances will be the provocative play, The Spurt of Blood by Antonin Artaud © Editions Gallimard, a playwright known for expressing the absurdities of the familiar; scenes that are at once obscene and beautiful, surreal and alive.</p>
<p>Director Nick SturgessMonks says he has taken a play that is full of “images, ideas, signs, and symbols that are all in search of a shape and crafted it in a way that will challenge the audience to construct, connect and question.”</p>
<p>What: This Sounds Familiar Though... Three Plays<br>When: 7pm, Wednesday 14 to Saturday 17 October 2009<br>Where: Studio 77, 77 Fairlie Terrace, Kelburn<br>Tickets: $15 waged and $8 unwaged<br>To book: email <a href="mailto:theatre@vuw.ac.nz">theatre@vuw.ac.nz</a> or call 04 463 5359</p>
