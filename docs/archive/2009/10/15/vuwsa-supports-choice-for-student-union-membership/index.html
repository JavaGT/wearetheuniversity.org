<p>14 October 2009 Media Statement</p>
<p>VUWSA supports choice for Student Union Membership - Young Nats stoked</p>
<p>Young Nats welcome today’s move by VUWSA to support the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill, which is currently heading to select committee.</p>
<p>The motion, put forward by students, ‘that VUWSA actively supports the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill’ passed. It supports the call for voluntary student union membership at Victoria University and all New Zealand’s tertiary institutions.</p>
<p>“Today’s call is a real win for thousands of students across New Zealand, who are the only group in society still forced to join a union,&quot; says Lauren Brazier, Vic Uni Young Nats President.</p>
<p>“This motion succeeded despite the underhanded delaying tactics witnessed, from those who are opponents of the legislation. The level of underhandedness that was pursued during the meeting continued to astound.”</p>
<p>“Throughout the meeting, despite the fact quorum had been meet, opponents called for numerous recounts in order to stall the motion from being voted on. Over four times this was used to delay the meeting as opponents tried to leverage more attendees to vote down the motion. This included the meetings Chairwoman making phone calls to seek others, instead of paying attention.”</p>
<p>“Other attempts to delay the motion involved the use of long winded speeches made by former and present student union leaders, all under the guise of ‘informing’ the debate. When speakers in favour of the motion stood to speak the personal attacks made by these student union leaders were unwarranted and unpleasant.&quot;</p>

<p>“Outrageously the motion took just under an hour to actually reach its vote, leaving little time for other student business we wished to discuss.”</p>
<p>“The motion supporting voluntary student membership passed 45-35 votes, even though continual quorum counts tally showed there only were 63 people in the room. If VUWSA can&#39;t even count hands, or know how to procedurally run a meeting correctly, why do we force tens of thousands of students each year to hand over millions of dollars in union membership levys?”</p>
<p>“Throughout the year we have seen devious and deceptive maneuvers - today’s attempts to derail democracy continues to disappoint.”</p>
