<p>Tertiary Strategy highlights importance of wider educational experience in academic achievement</p>
<p>Student leaders today are pleased with several parts of the draft Tertiary Education Strategy which outline the need for students to have a holistic and well rounded experience in tertiary education and that it acknowledges the importance of this for academic success.</p>
<p>“Tertiary education is so much more than simply turning up to lectures, handing in assignments and going to tutorials. Non-academic activities such as sports and societies, events, student media and other extra curricular activities are a key part of the tertiary education experience” said Jordan King, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see this holistic view of education recognised and reinforced by the Government in their first Strategy for the sector, and we also congratulate them on their commitment to ensuring students are supported to successfully complete their courses and qualifications” said King</p>
<p>“We are concerned however, that these commendable statements made in the Draft Tertiary Education Strategy are at odds with the National Party’s apparent support for Roger Douglas’ Private Members Bill, currently before the Select Committee. A similar Bill was introduced in Australia and ended up crippling student services in campuses across Australia, cost the Government over $100 million (NZD) to fund the transition period, and greatly undermined the student experience,” said King. “We question how, given the agreed importance of the holistic campus experience to student retention and completion rates, and the obvious contribution of students’ associations in this area, why the Government would support such unnecessary legislation, which the Minister of Tertiary Education, Anne Tolley, described as ‘not a high priority’ to student media at the start of the year?” added King.</p>
<p>“With more and more people heading into tertiary education, those that choose to go down this road should be supported by a high quality learning environment, in which they have the opportunity and choice to experience many different facets of student life – many of which students’ associations play a key role in,” concluded King.</p>
