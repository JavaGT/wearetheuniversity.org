<p>Friday, October 2, 2009<br>Massey offers disaster support to aid agencies</p>
<p>Professional capability in dealing with disasters and managing psychological impacts of the tsunami in the Pacific has been offered by Massey University.</p>
<p>Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Mäori and Pasifika) Professor Mason Durie says Massey staff from the Joint Centre for Disaster Research, the Centre for Defence Studies, the Institute of Development Studies and the School of Psychology will be made available to aid agencies if required. A formal offer was made to the Deputy Prime Minister Bill English yesterday.</p>
<p>“Once the immediate crisis has subsided, Massey University will be able to assist further with disaster recovery,” Professor Durie says. “Researchers in the relevant centres and our School of Public Health already have strong links with Pacific states, including Samoa and Tonga, and are well placed to provide evidence-based advice and guidance in the months ahead.</p>
<p>“As members of our staff and students have been directly impacted by the Pacific Tsunami a Massey University Pasifika Tsunami Fund is being established to provide financial assistance with travel to and from the Islands and associated expenses.”</p>
<p>“A number of support measures have been arranged on each campus and the University intends to provide further support and encouragement, both now and in the months ahead.”</p>
<p>As there is likelihood that similar disasters will occur in the future, Massey will work towards increasing Pasifika capability in disaster management.</p>
<p>“A scholarship programme will be established for Pasifika students who are eligible to study for the Graduate Diploma in Emergency Management, the Master of Public Health, the Master of Defence Studies or the Master of Philosophy (Emergency Management).”</p>
