<p><strong>Friday, 2 October 2009, 12:53 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Workers_Party_of_New_Zealand">Workers Party of New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Victoria University: No Free Speech Here Thanks.</p>
<p>Victoria Universitymanagement has repeatedly refused to answer the various charges laid against it by Workers Party activists Heleyni Pratley and Joel Cosgrove in response to the management imposing a two-year trespass order on them. </p>
<p>“This draconian trespass order was imposed on us for the crime of participating in a protest against substantial fee rises,” say Pratley, a former student exec member, and Cosgrove, last year’s student president.</p>
<p>Two students have also been charged with serious misconduct for participating in the protest, at which a few eggs were thrown at university councillors.</p>
<p>&quot;Protesters annoy Vic; they get in the way of its smooth business operation, that&#39;s why they put any protesters in a box guarded by security guards,&quot; say Pratley and Cosgrove.</p>
<p>“Every year Victoria Universityreceives hundreds of millions of public funds and claims to be the critic and conscience of society as well as the focus of a wider community. Yet when challenged on their behaviour they ban and attempt to silence anyone who disrupts their corporatist agenda.  They&#39;ve trespassed us because VUW cannot stand being called to account. Now they&#39;re setting up kangaroo courts to punish the students who participated.</p>
<p>&quot;The university is intentionally refusing to answer any questions about their actions, to silence any discussion, because what they did is indefensible and they know it,&quot; say the pair.</p>
<p>ENDS.  </p>
