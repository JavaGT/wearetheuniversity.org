<p>Media Statement</p>
<p>1st October 2009</p>
<p>Komiti Pasefika calls on Kiwis to help tsunami victims</p>
<p>The NZ Council of Trade Unions Komiti Pasefika says the tsunami which has hit Samoa and Tonga is a tragedy for thousands of workers and their families both in New Zealand and overseas and is encouraging New Zealanders to donate generously.</p>
<p>Komiti Pasefika is the representative body for Pacific Island workers, representing over 60,000 union members across New Zealand.</p>
<p>Jerome Mika says</p>
<p>“The difficulty with this situation is the unknown, there are thousands of Pasefika families in New Zealand right now watching the events rolling out in the media and on Internet forums waiting to hear news about their loved ones.</p>
<p>“All Pacific Islanders understand the concept of family and how important it is to ensure families are provided for. There are many agencies who will be assisting with aid and Komiti Pasefika is calling on New Zealanders from all backgrounds to donate generously during this tragic time.”</p>
<p>The following agencies are taking donations to help tsunami victims in Samoa and Tonga:</p>
<p>The New Zealand Red Cross has launched a Samoa Tsunami Relief project at <a href="http://www.givealittle.co.nz">www.givealittle.co.nz</a>.

<p>Stella Teariki says</p>
<p>“For these organisations to be effective in helping flood victims the best form of assistance we can give is money.</p>
<p>“We would urge all union members to think about how they can assist our brothers and sisters in the islands through your own networks, communities and church groups.</p>
<p>“Komiti Pasefika is currently developing a plan on how we can assist more effectively and will provide an update on this as the situation develops.”</p>
<p>Ends.</p>
