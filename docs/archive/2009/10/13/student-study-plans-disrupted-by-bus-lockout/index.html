<p><strong>Tuesday, 13 October 2009, 4:33 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_Students_Association">Auckland University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Study plans of Auckland University students have been disrupted recently by the decision of NZ Bus to continue to lockout student commuters from the Auckland public transport network, as the dispute drags into its sixth day tomorrow.</p>
<p>“University students are two weeks from the end of the second semester, and missing classes in this final period will directly affect preparation for the upcoming end of year exams,” said Darcy Peacock, President of the Auckland University Students’ Association. “The ongoing refusal of NZ Bus to allow the Auckland Combined Unions to work-to-rule while at the negotiating table will see students miss critical lectures.”</p>
<p>“We want to see an end to this conflict that is fair and reasonable so that this type of disruption will not occur again in the future. The suspension of bus services has already affected grades and a longer suspension will see mounting problems with exams coming up,” said Peacock.</p>
<p>Students recently approved a motion at a public meeting supporting the Auckland Combined Unions call for increased wages for bus drivers.</p>
<p>“AUSA encourages NZ Bus to offer living wages to its workforce and allow students to keep their minds on study,” concluded Peacock.</p>
