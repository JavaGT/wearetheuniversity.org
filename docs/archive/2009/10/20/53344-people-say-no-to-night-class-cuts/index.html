<p><strong>Tuesday, 20 October 2009, 2:47 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>53,344 people say no to night class cuts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Over 53,000 people have signed petitions calling on the Government to reverse<br>night class cuts which will be damaging to individuals, communities and the opportunities available to them, says Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Maryan Street.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maryan Street, joined by Labour Leader Phil Goff and other Labour MPs, was today presented with a petition carrying 51,089 signatures collected by CLASS (the Community Learning Association through Schools), ACE co-ordinators around the country and by Labour MPs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The petition is the largest presented in this parliamentary term. It reads: &quot;That the House of Representatives call on the National Government to reverse all expenditure cuts in Budget 2009 that affect Adult and Community Education services for the 2009/10 financial year, with a reinstatement of these funds taking effect from 1 January 2010&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A further 2,255 signatures collected by Maryan Street and Damien O’Connor in Nelson, Tasman and the West Coast were also presented as part of accompanying petitions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“There has been nationwide opposition to the cuts, with thousands of people protesting on the streets. These signatures have been collected in just four months. They carry a clear message to Anne Tolley to admit she got it wrong,” Maryan Street says.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Three in every four schools providing night classes will lose their funding next year. The remaining funding will cover courses for just 25,000 adults. With over 220,000 people enrolled in ACE courses, up to 180,000 adult learners could now miss out.</strong></p>

<p>“The short-sighted cuts will be damaging to individuals and their communities who will lose opportunities to educate their households. They are also resulting in job losses and restricting access to critical classes such as NZ Sign Language and te reo Maori.</p>
<p>“The Government has also yet to explain how groups providing vital community services like Citizens Advice Bureaux, Parent Help Lines, Youth Line, Women’s Refuges, Budgeting Services and many others, who used the courses to train volunteers, will be funded in future,” Maryan Street says.</p>
