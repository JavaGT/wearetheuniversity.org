<p><strong>Lincoln University Architecture Honoured</strong></p>
<p>The Lincoln University School of Landscape Architecture has yet another cause for celebration – its new building has won a Public Architecture award in the Canterbury Architecture Awards.</p>
<p>The building, by Sheppard &amp;Rout Architects Ltd and Royal Associates Architects, was honoured for being what judges describe as a groundbreaking education building. Jury convenor Crispin Schurr says “its cohesive inclusive feel helps create synergies for students to learn together.”</p>
<p>Head of School Neil Challenger says the judges have recognised and acknowledged the special aim of the $6million building.</p>
<p>“It is entirely appropriate that Lincoln University, New Zealand’s specialist land-based university, has reflected its commitment to transforming land, people and economies by investing in this new building,” he says.</p>
<p>“The new building enhances the ability of the students to interact and allow the studios to be managed as though they were professional offices.</p>
<p>“The 150 students in the school are working in a hybrid model of design education, where computing and sketching are integrated to combine the creative freedom of the pencil with the production and rigor of computers- no drawing boards - and we are already seeing better results than ever before.”</p>
<p>The Landscape Architecture building was designed by Jasper van der Lingen at Sheppard and Rout and Perry Royal at Royal Associates. It will be officially opened on November 20, amid a weekend of celebrations of 40 years of Landscape Architecture being taught at Lincoln University.</p>

<p>In the same awards ceremony and in contrast to the newest building on the campus, another building at Lincoln University won an award for its longevity</p>
<p>An award for Enduring Architecture was made to the 1967 Hilgendorf Wing, described by the judges as a “brutalist classic”.</p>
<p>The judges say “Although the power and composition of the original elevations of the building had been diluted by later developments and encroaching vegetation, its significant contribution to the Canterbury brutalist tradition of its era was still clear.”</p>
<p>Neil Challenger says this award is a clear statement of the longevity expected of Lincoln University’s buildings and the significance of its built fabric.</p>
