<p>28 October 2009 Media Statement</p>
<p>Cops on bikes --- will crims play by the new rules?</p>
<p>It is ironic that police are getting back on their bikes in Canterbury, a police district that has lost 32 vehicles in the Government’s police budget cuts, says Labour law and order spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
<p>“Cycle cops are a good option for increasing police visibility in the community, and Labour is all in favour of that,” Clayton Cosgrove said. “In fact, Labour was responsible for encouraging development of a new style of community policing.</p>
<p>“However, the Canterbury public is well aware the region has been particularly hard hit by the Government’s $21 million budget-cutting demands on police.</p>
<p>“Nationally more than 340 police vehicles will be lost, with 10 percent of the losses occurring in Canterbury,” Clayton Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot to be said for letting cops be seen on bikes, but it is dubious whether criminals will play by the new protocols.</p>
<p>“While, as police say, bikes will allow police greater manoeuvrability in traffic, will they be able to keep up with criminals who prefer to use vehicles to commit their crimes?”</p>
<p>Clayton Cosgrove said that the “cycle cops” experiment would be enthusiastically supported in an environment in which the Government was maintaining or boosting police resources, “but this is happening in a context of the Government cutting police resources.</p>
<p>“The Government’s commitment to community safety in Canterbury is already suspect. Sadly, this initiative, no matter how well-intended, will not increase the level of public reassurance.”</p>
