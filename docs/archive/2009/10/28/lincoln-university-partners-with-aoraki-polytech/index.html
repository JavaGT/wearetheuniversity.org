<p><strong>Wednesday, 28 October 2009, 3:51 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>Lincoln University’s long and strong connections with South Canterbury receive a new and formal educational stamp today (28 October) with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Aoraki Polytechnic.</p>
<p>The MOU, signed by Professor Roger Field, Vice-Chancellor of Lincoln University, and Kay Nelson, Chief Executive of Aoraki Polytechnic, provides a pathway for Aoraki holders of the New Zealand Diploma in Business (widely known as the “NZDipBus”) to gain credit towards a Lincoln University commerce degree.</p>
<p>Specifically the agreement allows those with a New Zealand Diploma in Business completed through Aoraki Polytechnic to enter a Lincoln University Bachelor of Commerce degree directly at the second year level.</p>
<p>The MOU sees New Zealand’s specialist land-based university, Lincoln University, working with Aoraki Polytechnic to bring university-level study - undergraduate, postgraduate, executive development and research - into the South Canterbury region.</p>
<p>“The overall aim of this alliance between Aoraki Polytechnic and Lincoln University is to further enhance tertiary education in South Canterbury,” says Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Roger Field.</p>
<p>“Both Lincoln University and Aoraki Polytechnic believe that a highly skilled and qualified workforce can help build a stronger economy, especially in South Canterbury.</p>
<p>“Lincoln University’s commitment to transforming land, people and economies is expressed in this connection with Aoraki Polytechnic.”</p>

<p>There are numerous advantages for South Canterbury students in the new arrangement between Lincoln University and Aoraki Polytechnic says Dr Tony Brien, Senior Lecturer in Business Management in Lincoln University’s Faculty of Commerce.</p>
<p>“Essentially the new arrangement means that students who are completing, or who have completed, the New Zealand Diploma in Business in Timaru, Ashburton or Oamaru with Aoraki Polytechnic, can start their degree in their home district and while actually living at home.”</p>
<p>“Then there is the educationally significant point that the South Canterbury students will come into a Lincoln University programme with some solid study experience behind them and the confidence that comes from having finished a qualification, the NZ Diploma in Business. They will be off to a good start as second year degree students at Lincoln University.</p>
<p>“An academically smooth transition into the commerce degree programme benefits everyone,” says Dr Brien.</p>
