<p>28 October 2009 Media Statement</p>
<p>English can’t tell a ‘good look’ from a ‘look good’</p>
<p>Finance Minister Bill English seems almost incapable of understanding what constitutes a conflict of interest, says Labour Finance spokesperson David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“His response today to the blatantly self-promoting TVNZ ‘plain English’ promo has been that it ‘looks quite good’,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“I’m not surprised that the promo appeals to his vanity and his ego, but although he thinks he ‘looks quite good’, it is certainly not a good look for the shareholding minister in TVNZ to be featured in a promo that is simply a party political broadcast.”</p>
<p>David Cunliffe said it had taken weeks for Mr English to admit that his “double dipping” at taxpayer expense on housing allowances was ‘not a good look’.</p>
<p>“This morning a political scientist at Massey University described the promo as being almost identical to a party political broadcast from 2002 when Mr English was National leader. That is why it is so inappropriate for a shareholding minister to be a willing and enthusiastic partner in this exercise.</p>
<p>“It’s all very well for Bill English to say the promo was TVNZ’s idea. The fact is that he is a shareholding minister, and he knows he must steer clear of anything that could be seen as a potential conflict of interest,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“It is impossible to believe that he could not see a conflict of interest in this self-promotion, and yet he has gone along with it anyway.</p>

<p>“Bill English thinks he ‘looks quite good’. It doesn’t look at all good to Kiwis that a minister whose judgment has already been tarnished is getting hundreds of thousands of dollars of free advertising from the state broadcaster in which he has a shareholding responsibility. That is an abuse of his position.”</p>
<p>David Cunliffe said the bitter irony for hard-working Kiwis is that the promo is for programmes about the state of the New Zealand economy. “Instead of preening in a television promo, Mr English as Finance Minister should be focusing on helping Kiwi families work their way out of a recession that has costs thousands of New Zealanders their jobs and security.”</p>
