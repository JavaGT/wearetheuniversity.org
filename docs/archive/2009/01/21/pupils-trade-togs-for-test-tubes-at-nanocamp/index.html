<p>While most teenagers are at the beach this summer, 12 high school pupils from across the country are busy in the laboratory at the inaugural NanoCamp at the Manawatu campus.</p>
<p>The week-long camp gives science-loving year 13 pupils the chance to spend their summer holiday immersed in experiments, says senior chemistry lecturer Dr Shane Telfer.</p>
<p>“We’re giving them an introduction to nano-science with a hands-on one-week course,” he says. “They get to carry out experiments in the labs here and learn from a number of Massey lecturers.”</p>
<p>The pupils are staying on campus at Matai Hall, with social events part of the schedule.</p>
<p>Dr Telfer says the 12 positions for this year’s camp were highly sought after.</p>
<p>“We had 250 applications for the 12 positions,” he says. “The week is free for the pupils as funding has been provided by the MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology.”</p>
<p>In fact, the pupils have revisited one of the discoveries made by Alan MacDiarmid, who won the Nobel Prize in 2000.</p>
<p>“Earlier in the week they made conducting polymers – flexible plastics that can conduct electricity -– which were invented by Alan MacDiarmid,” Dr Telfer says. “They’ve also made organic light emitting diodes and will try their hands at atomic force microscopy later this week.”</p>
<p>Reporoa College pupil Morgan Vine, 17, says the camp is a great opportunity.</p>
<p>“It’s very good and I’ve learnt a lot so far,” he says. “Because there’s only a small number of us you get to ask a lot of questions and get good feedback. The labs are far more sophisticated than the ones at school as well.”</p>
