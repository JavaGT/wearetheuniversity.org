<p>Massey graduates to cast critical eye over US President’s inaugural address</p>
<p>Massey University graduates will be analysing the power of speech when they reunite to discuss Barack Obama’s presidential address.</p>
<p>Lecturer Dr Heather Kavan will lead an email discussion with about 20 students from her last speech writing course.</p>
<p>Dr Kavan, who has written political speeches, says the hotly-anticipated address on January 21 (NZ time) will cement Obama’s place in history.</p>
<p>“He is under an enormous amount of pressure to deliver one of the greatest speeches ever,” she says.</p>
<p>“A truly great speech is soulful, it lifts us above man-made judgements to a greater dignity.</p>
<p>“Obama has a wonderful ability to tell stories that have impact. He has a black rhythmic speech style that generates an emotional response.”</p>
<p>Dr Kavan says that the group will discuss the speech&#39;s impact, as well as its style and language.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be interesting to see the students’ responses because, when asked to evaluate speeches, students don&#39;t usually rate presidential ones the highest,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand students tend to prefer brave, risky speeches born of adversity, rather than inaugural addresses designed to make listeners feel secure.”</p>
<p>Last year students chose Martin Luther King&#39;s &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech and Earl Spencer&#39;s speech at Diana&#39;s funeral as the greatest speeches of all time.</p>
<p>&quot;So many people are saying that Obama&#39;s speech is likely to be one of the greatest speeches ever,” says Dr Kavan. “Obama&#39;s speech writing team are young. Jon Favreau, the lead speech writer is only 27 years old. If anyone can appreciate the pressure the team are under, it&#39;s speech writing students.”</p>

<p>Dr Kavan says to expect the classic inaugural speech themes of hope and unity alongside great optimism in pessimistic times.</p>
<p>“Obama’s words have a musical quality. He inspires confidence. Some people are saying he hasn’t experienced the suffering of Martin Luther King and not lived through the extremes of discrimination but I think this speech could be in the same league as King’s – I wish I could be in the audience.”</p>
<p>Caitlin Cunningham, a graduate of the speech writing course, is excited to be taking part in the discussion group.</p>
<p>“Obama’s speech will be a momentous event in these changing times and I want to experience that,” she says.</p>
