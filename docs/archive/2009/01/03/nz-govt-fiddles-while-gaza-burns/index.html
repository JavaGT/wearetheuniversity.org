<p>NZ Govt fiddles while Gaza burns</p>
<p>Green MP Keith Locke has criticised the New Zealand Government for its silence on the bombardment of Gaza.</p>
<p>&quot;While other governments work around the clock on the issue, ours has gone missing,&quot; said Mr Locke, Green Party Foreign Affairs Spokesperson.</p>
<p>&quot;No formal statement has been issued, and the Foreign Affairs Ministry website has nothing on the Gaza crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully, this press statement will embarrass our government to issue its own statement, although it will be a week and 400 lives too late.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand should be providing some moral leadership amid an insipid response from other Western nations. The Bush administration is backing Israel&#39;s murderous assault, and European nations are restricting themselves to calling on both sides to cease fire.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, we want both sides to stop the violence. But the pressure should be focused on Israel, which is causing such massive destruction and 99% of the casualties.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clearly a war crime for the Israeli government to target mosques, universities, TV stations, police stations, government buildings and the private homes of political leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;It also makes a mockery of New Zealand&#39;s participation in a &#39;war on terror&#39; to allow such obvious state terrorism to pass without comment.</p>
<p>&quot;Now is the time for New Zealand to stand up and be counted. The people of Gaza need us to speak out.</p>
<p>&quot;There is hope for peace if the bombing stops. The Hamas leader Ismail Haniya has offered talks on outstanding issues when there is a ceasefire and the blockade of Gaza is lifted.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand is getting left behind by Australia, which has just announced it is giving an extra $A5 million in humanitarian aid to Gaza. New Zealand needs to urgently up its aid to Gaza, given the dire situation of the people there,&quot; said Mr Locke.</p>
