<p>NZUSA elects student leaders for 2009</p>
<p>The New Zealand Union of Students&#39; Associations (NZUSA) has elected its national officers for 2009. Sophia Blair and Jordan King will be the Co-Presidents of NZUSA.</p>
<p>&quot;2009 represents the 80th anniversary of NZUSA and is an important time to reflect on the importance and relevance of the student union movement in the fight for a fair and equitable education system&quot; said Sophia Blair, Co-President of NZUSA.</p>
<p>Sophia was the Education Vice President at Auckland University Students&#39; Association (AUSA) last year and currently half way through an honours degree in political studies.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand still has a highly inequitable tertiary education system - fees are massively high and students are still the only group in society forced to borrow to live. I look forward to an active dialogue with the new government in working towards a quality and affordable debt free tertiary education system,&quot; said Jordan King, Co-President of NZUSA.</p>
<p>Jordan was the Rep Groups and Logistics co-coordinator for NZUSA last year and studying towards a degree in sociology and media studies. He is a current member of Victoria University council.</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.</p>
