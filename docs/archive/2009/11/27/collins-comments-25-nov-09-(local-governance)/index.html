<p>25 November 2009<br>Local Governance</p>
<p>Recently announced ward, local board and boundary changes will ensure Papakura has a strong voice on the new Auckland Council.</p>
<p>The Local Government Commission has suggested dividing Auckland into 12 wards – eight with two councillors and four with one councillor.</p>
<p>Papakura is to be part of the greater Papakura-Manurewa ward with two councillors. Our district’s small population means it does not meet the fair representation requirement to be a standalone ward.</p>
<p>The Papakura-Manurewa ward will stretch from Drury’s Great South Road-Southern Motorway interchange to Puhinui Road, Manukau. It encompasses Hingaia, Pahurehure, Takanini and parts of Alfriston together with Manurewa East, Wattle Downs, Weymouth, Homai and Wiri.</p>
<p>I’m pleased to say the commission has recommended establishing a single Papakura board. This gives our district the opportunity to retain our local voice.</p>
<p>Nineteen local boards are proposed within Auckland with five to nine members each, totaling 126 board members. Each board must represent an area with 53,000 or more people – apart from the mandatory boards for Waiheke and Great Barrier Island communities.</p>
<p>Papakura, with a population of 44,000, is the only exception.</p>
<p>This is great news for our district – five elected board members will continue to represent Papakura’s interests in the Auckland Council decision-making process.</p>
<p>The Commission is also proposing changes to Auckland’s southern boundary. Former parts of Waikato will become part of greater Auckland including:</p>

<p>• Urban areas of Waiuku and Pukekohe and adjacent future growth areas<br>• The adjacent area of Buckland<br>• The area to the east of Pukekohe, north of Mill road</p>
<p>The Mangatawhiri and Mangatangi catchments will be included in the Waikato Region together with the part of Franklin District between the Mangatangi Stream catchment and the Firth of Thames.<br>I encourage you to share your views about the proposals with the Commission. Residents have until 5pm on 11 December to make submissions:</p>
