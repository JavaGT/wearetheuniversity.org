<p>Green MPs back low paid workers</p>
<p>Green MPs today joined union actions across the country against the wage freeze in the public sector.</p>
<p>“It is shameful that many of our hardest workers are among the worst paid, some of them only getting $12.50 an hour,” said Green Party industrial relations spokesperson Keith Locke.</p>
<p>Today ‘Lift The Freeze’ lunchtime rallies were held all over New Zealand, involving thousands of lowly paid hospital orderlies, cleaners, kitchen staff and school support workers.</p>
<p>“Once we prided ourselves in being an egalitarian society,” said Mr Locke.</p>
<p>“Now we have one of the fastest growing gaps between the rich and poor.</p>
<p>“The Ministers behind the wage freeze, which is keeping many workers below $14 an hour, are themselves earning over $100 an hour.</p>
<p>“We are becoming world leaders in inequality, not equality. How can people have an equal chance in life when they are stuck earning around $13 dollars an hour – a figure mentioned by representatives of school support staff at the rallies today.</p>
<p>&quot;While the Government talks of a desire to lift incomes to Australian levels individual ministers are signaling to their department heads to keep wages down.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Locke said the Green Party is part of the citizens’ initiated referendum campaign to lift the minimum wage to $15 an hour. It also favours an automatic annual adjustment to the minimum wage, ensuring it equates to no less than 66% of the average wage.</p>
<p>“The Green Party is committed to all Kiwi workers getting a fair go, and that means first and foremost an income they can live on,” said Mr Locke.</p>
