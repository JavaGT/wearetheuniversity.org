<p>National&#39;s Public Services Report Card: Not Achieved</p>
<p>The professionalism of New Zealand’s public service needs to be applauded given the last 12 months which has seen National undermine the quality of services for New Zealanders., Labour’s State Services spokesperson Grant Robertson said today.</p>
<p>“One year one from National taking office there has been large scale cuts to programmes and staffing in the public service. Fewer public servants are being expected to do more work,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>“Public servants are feeling stressed and vulnerable, but need congratulating for providing first rate services to New Zealanders under trying circumstances.</p>
<p>“National&#39;s record has been shameful. In education, health and social development important programmes have been cut, and more than a thousand positions have been disestablished, with many people going out of work.</p>
<p>“Despite assurances from State Services Minister Tony Ryall, front line services have been impacted by National’s cutbacks and many cases it’s the regions that have been hit. Almost 60% of public servants work outside Wellington. Positions have gone in critical areas such as CYFS, Biosecurity, Conservation, School Library service, IRD and ACC. Ordinary Kiwis will lose from these cuts.</p>
<p>“The attempt by Tony Ryall to put in place a pay freeze is seeing strike action being taken by frontline staff in courts, hospitals and parliamentary security officers. Other Government staff are also planning industrial action. In addition Bill English has been talking tough to teachers and nurses who have contracts coming up next year. National needs to play fair to ensure essential services continue.</p>

<p>“Tony Ryall’s attempt to soften the blow for public servants who lost their jobs was nothing more than a token effort with just two jobs saved under his redeployment scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;National campaigned on respecting the professionalism of public servants, but we have seen Nick Smith announce redundancies at ACC before staff were told, and just recently John Key and Bill English attacked the integrity of Treasury officials.</p>
<p>&quot;The Treasury does deserve some congratulations for looking at ways of centralising some services such as IT and procurement, but this needs to be done in such a way that does not see large offshore companies gather up the work.</p>
<p>“Everyone supports finding efficiencies and innovations in the public service, but National cutbacks are part of a fundamental change to the way Kiwis get access to public services. Mr Ryall and his colleagues need to do better to ensure Kiwis get the services they deserve,” Grant Robertson said</p>
