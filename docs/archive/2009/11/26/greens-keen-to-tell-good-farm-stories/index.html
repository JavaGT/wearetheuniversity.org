<p><strong>Greens keen to tell Good Farm Stories</strong></p>
<p>Innovative farmers got a big ‘good on you’ from the Green Party today.</p>
<p>A website featuring sustainable farm practices was launched at Parliament by Green Party MP Jeanette Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>“There are great things going on and it’s time more of these good farm stories got told,” said Ms Fitzsimons. “Some farmers are proving that we can have a healthy farming sector and a healthy environment.</p>
<p>“I’ve collected stories about how to improve animal health, protect rivers and streams, reduce pesticide use, improve biodiversity, manage the soil, and protect against drought. These measures can reduce costs too.”</p>
<p>The Green Party agriculture spokesperson has been touring the country throughout the year talking with farmers about sustainability. Her Good Farm Stories website will feature eighteen of the best examples so far.</p>
<p>The project would help balance a debate often dominated by a minority of farmers who are abusing the environment, Ms Fitzsimons said: “There is a good farm story for every ‘dirty dairy’ story that turns up in the papers. These good farmers are ambassadors for New Zealand’s clean, green brand.”</p>
<p>Farmers from Otago, Canterbury, Wairarapa, Hawke’s Bay, Bay of Plenty and the Waikato are featured on the new website.</p>
<p>Guests at Ms Fitzsimons’ lunchtime launch are expected to include representatives from Federated Farmers and Fonterra.</p>
<p>Among other stories, they will hear about the Horsham Downs dairy farm which removed 5 hectares of land from grazing and saw production remain steady.</p>

<p>The land was given over to a wetland surrounding a lake which has slowed the summertime release of water from the surrounding farmland and also improved the remaining pasture’s fertility through the return of nutrients from silt traps.</p>
<p>“I’ve been excited to pick up some ideas we are trying on the farm at home too”, the Green MP said.</p>
