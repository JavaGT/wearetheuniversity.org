<p><strong>Tuesday, 10 November 2009, 4:47 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University">Massey University</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Engineering students mix creativity with<br>complex solutions</strong></p>
<p>Complex engineering problems and their solutions will be on display in an exhibition that caps four years of study for engineering students at the Wellington campus.</p>
<p>Observe, Invent, Realise will be held at the Holiday Inn on Wednesday and showcases the students’ self-directed solutions to a wide range of complex engineering problems in both the real and virtual worlds, including projects that bridge the two.</p>
<p>In addition to the work itself, students have had to defend their methods and progress in front of their peers, public and a panel of engineering academics and professionals.</p>
<p>A range of mechatronics projects will be on display along with five multi-media projects that provide a first opportunity to see work from the Multimedia Systems Engineering major.</p>
<p>The projects range from web design to a new computer game that is best viewed wearing provided 3D glasses.</p>
<p>This is the first year that the University has held an engineering exhibition in conjunction with its annual BLOW09 creative festival.</p>
<p>The exhibition runs from 3pm – 7pm tomorrow at the Holiday Inn, 75 Featherston Street Wellington.</p>
