<p><strong>Hatching great ideas during Global Entrepreneurship Week</strong></p>
<p>The e-centre, the University’s business incubator unit at the Albany campus has organised Entrepreneurs Day on November 17, which offers a free 20-minute appointment with an expert for anyone with a business idea.</p>
<p>The &quot;E-Day&quot; initiative is part of Global Entrepreneurship Week, which starts on November 16 and has support ranging from United States president Barrack Obama to New Zealand Prime Minister John Key. The week aims to encourage more people to consider and take action on entrepreneurship as a career path.</p>
<p>That is something the e-centre is very keen to help people do, says business analyst Sabrina Nagel. “So many people sit on an idea with great potential, but it stays an idea unless you start acting on it. We are here to help hatch ideas by giving advice on how to progress it further, where to get help, who to contact, and to give some indication of how good the idea is. We also help entrepreneurs to protect their idea and gain maximum value from commercialisation,” Ms Nagel says.</p>
<p>Also taking place during the week is the Global Innovation Tournament, which gives students eight days to create an object or idea with as much social or economic value as possible. Individuals or teams of up to 15 people then work on their innovation and post it on YouTube.</p>
<p>The director of the University’s New Zealand Small and Medium Enterprise Research Centre, Dr David Deakins, will speak at the opening of Global Entrepreneurship Week at the Wellington City Council Mayoral Chambers on Monday, while Claire Matthews, senior lecturer in banking studies, will speak at the closing ceremony held at NZX, also in Wellington, on Friday, November 20.</p>
