<p><strong>Students outraged at Polytechnic governance changes</strong></p>
<p>Student representatives are outraged at today’s release of an Education and Science Select Committee report on a Bill which will fundamentally alter the nature and quality of Polytechnic Councils.</p>
<p>“The Select Committee heard many strong and convincing arguments demonstrating the flaws and complete inappropriate nature of what was being proposed, and to have this not only ignored but the Bill now made significantly worse is appalling and totally unacceptable”, said Jordan King, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).</p>
<p>The Education (Polytechnics) Amendment Bill will see the longstanding dedicated positions for student, staff, industry and community representatives on the Councils of Polytechnics and Institutes of Technology abolished.</p>
<p>“Across the education spectrum, there is a wide acknowledgement and appreciation of the contribution of student representatives at council levels. Students are the key stakeholder in education and therefore should have a say in the educational direction and quality of their educational institutions” said King.</p>
<p>“The complete lack of consultation on the Bill at all, and now this total disregard for representative governance is an attack on Polytechnics and the student voice within the sector”, said Blair. “This will have an extremely negative and long term impact on Polytechnics and is a very worrying development”, said King.</p>
<p>“Students will not let this matter lie and the Government can expect strong opposition should this Bill make it into law,” concluded King.</p>
