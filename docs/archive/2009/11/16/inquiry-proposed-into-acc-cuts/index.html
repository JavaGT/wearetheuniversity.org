<p><strong>Monday, 16 November 2009, 11:24 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>15 November 2009<br>Media Statement</p>
<p>Inquiry proposed into impact on health services of ACC cuts</p>
<p>ACC cut backs will place an increasing strain on health services which is why Labour will seek a select committee inquiry into this issue, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.</p>
<p>“So far National has cut back ACC funded elective surgery resulting in more people being placed on hospital waiting lists, diagnostic procedures like MRIs have had funding cuts and part-charges for physiotherapy will result in fewer people taking part in rehabilitation.</p>
<p>“Elderly New Zealanders have also had their access to falls prevention cut, meaning that increasing numbers will be hospitalised following falls,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>“These cut backs have a financial impact on health services but also mean resources that would previously have been provided by ACC must now be found by hospitals. It is therefore essential that we allow health professionals, members of the public and other organisations to have their say on what the full impacts of the ACC cut backs are.</p>
<p>“I will propose on behalf of the Labour Party that a health select committee inquiry be held on both the resourcing and financial implications of reducing ACC services.</p>
<p>“Given the National Party’s claims that it is committed to improving health services I would expect the Government MPs to support holding an inquiry.</p>
<p>“We know the implications of ACC cut backs will be increased workloads for frontline doctors and nurses, but we need to ensure that the full impact of the changes planned by the National Government are being catered for in the health sector.</p>

<p>“ACC Minister Nick Smith has said he needs to make cut backs to save his department money, but in reality the health sector will simply end up picking up the tab for many of these changes,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
