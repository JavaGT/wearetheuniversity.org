<p>Postgraduate Nursing Centre Official Opening</p>
<p>The expanded and relocated Centre for Postgraduate Nursing Studies at the Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Otago, is to be officially opened by the Associate Minister of Health, Ruth Dyson, and the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Otago, Professor David Skegg, on Friday February 18 at 3pm.</p>
<p>The opening of the Centre at Geos House, 72 Oxford Terrace, will be attended by over 90 people including, CDHB management and CEO Jean O’Callaghan. The CDHB has been supportive of the new Centre as it is keen to see nurses gain further specialisation with relevant clinical skills and knowledge.</p>
<p>“This is an exciting day for us, and marks a turning point in our development in this excellent new location,” says Director Mary Miles. “The two floors provide much more space for our programmes for registered nurses. On top of that there is a beautiful outlook over the Avon!”</p>
<p>Nurses can spend up to fifty percent of their time educating patients whether it is in health maintenance, or assisting those facing chronic health problems. The Centre educates across the spectrum of nursing interests, from bedside to community to administration.</p>
<p>Advanced nursing studies also enable improved patient outcomes, and there is ample research evidence from overseas to support this. New Zealand is aware of the necessity to foster advanced clinical careers for nurses; moves which are supported by both the Government and nurses.</p>

<p>The Centre is constantly expanding its range of papers for hospital and community based nurses. It offers a substantial range of programmes from Certificate to PhD level. New staff have recently been appointed with interests in Aged Care, Nursing Leadership and Management, and High Dependency Nursing. Most papers can be studied part-time and through distance learning.</p>
<p>Director Mary Miles says that one of the strengths of the Centre is its qualifications are University-based, drawing on the medical expertise of the University of Otago, and providing internationally recognised qualifications. She says this is particularly important in the growing field of nursing research.</p>
<p>The opening on Friday features a cameo exhibition of nursing in the past, present and future, including photographs and hospital equipment supplied by the Medical History Trust.</p>
<p>The Centre welcomes members of the public, all nurses, health professionals and those who might be considering advancing their nursing career to visit the exhibition and view the expanded facilities from Monday February 21 - 25.  </p>
