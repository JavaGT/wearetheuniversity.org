<p>Liberty Belle - Thu, 17 Feb 2005</p>
<p>Typically, many of the lunacy sightings concern traffic officers and their nazi-like behaviour. One of the worst came from a reader travelling on SH1 in a late model car driven by a respectable, middle-aged but one-armed driver who cannot wear a seatbelt as he needs to lean forward to use the indicators, etc, with his stump. &quot;We get stopped by a traffic nazi who has observed our driver&#39;s not wearing a seatbelt.&quot;</p>
<p>The driver explains, waving his stump, that he&#39;s exempt because he&#39;s only got one arm. &quot;Where&#39;s your medical certificate?&quot; demands the cop.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t need a medical certificate to prove I&#39;ve only got one arm,&quot; again waving the stump. After much argument, huffing and puffing, the cop inspects the driver&#39;s licence; depth of tread on tyres, WOF and rego, then very grumpily (nothing to issue a ticket for) allows them to pass.</p>
<p>Then I was told of a burglary in a Wellington penthouse. Dressed as a workman, with protective hat and overalls, a stair-dancer gained access to the ceiling, dropped down into the apartment and helped himself to credit cards, jewellery, etc. Police were having a coffee in the ground floor café, watched this robber walk out and commented that his Louis Vuitton bags didn&#39;t really match his clothing. Oh, must be his lunchbox, they concluded, and carried on supping lattes while the thief wandered off. Whatever happened to the old &quot;hello, hello, hello, what&#39;s this then?&quot;</p>
<p>And this lunacy sighting is a cracker. Under the Animal Products Act, egg producers are now classified as meat processors. So Mr Perry Spiller, a free-range egg producer with 100 hens, has to collect the eggs wearing gloves, gumboots, overalls and a hairnet. &quot;Collecting eggs and putting them in cartons is now defined as a method of meat processing. Are eggs liquid meat I ask you ?,&quot; he told a Hawke&#39;s Bay newspaper. Once Perry had 500 hens but ridiculous risk-management programmes and compliance costs are now putting him out of business. Come July and he&#39;s out.</p>

<p>Can you believe we pay grown-ups to sit in offices in Wellington dreaming up these nutty regulations? I know in some US states it&#39;s illegal to use soft-poached eggs in Caesar salads in case someone gets salmonella poisoning, but this is ridiculous. Must New Zealand insist on going down this cottonwool, risk-averse, wimpish, bureaucratic path to economic and cultural suicide? And I use the word cultural deliberately.</p>
<p>I grew up on a farm - feeding chooks, collecting eggs, milking cows, docking lambs, lambing ewes – barefoot, scantily clad and definitely no hairnet in sight. It&#39;s part of my culture and the culture of thousands of New Zealanders like me. We&#39;re losing it to the clutches of Nanny State. Maori claim their culture is a taonga under the Treaty of Waitangi, why should ours not be protected too?</p>
