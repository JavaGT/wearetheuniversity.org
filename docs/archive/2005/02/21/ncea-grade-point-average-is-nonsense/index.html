<p><strong>Monday, 21 February 2005, 8:22 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>NCEA grade point average is nonsense</p>
<p>National’s Education spokesman, Bill English, says parents and employers will be misled by the grade average included in the NCEA results, and it should either include failure or be abolished.</p>
<p>“The grade average appears as a number summarising each student’s results. It looks like a percentage and that&#39;s how parents and employers will see it.</p>
<p>“But it is very misleading. The grade average counts only the standards that have been passed – it does not take into account any failures.</p>
<p>“So, a student who fails several standards can end up with a better grade average than a student who passes all his or her exams. Students who do well in some subjects get better grades if they fail their weaker subjects than if they just pass them.</p>
<p>“The grade average should be a useful summary of achievement.</p>
<p>“Labour’s obsession with abolishing the idea of failure is giving parents and employers a misleading picture of students’ achievements – as if they didn&#39;t already have enough trouble understanding all the other information on a student’s record.</p>
<p>“The grade average should include failure or be abolished,” Mr English says.</p>
