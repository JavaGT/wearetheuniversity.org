<p><strong>Thursday, 17 February 2005, 5:02 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Bill English<br>National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>17 February 2005</p>
<p>Ministers cooperate in cover-up</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English, says it was confirmed in the House today that Education Ministers Trevor Mallard and David Benson-Pope worked together to keep shonky scholarship results from the public.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministers&#39; revelations confirm that Labour has focussed its entire effort on minimising political damage rather than providing clear and honest information to distressed students, parents and teachers.</p>
<p>&quot;It also emerged in Parliament that David Benson-Pope was aware of the scholarship shambles as early as January 25, when he advised Trevor Mallard. But for more than two weeks following that date he continued to deny any knowledge other than what was in the media and said he could not do anything about the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has shown no interest in the impact this debacle has had on thousands of students.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no accountability. No Minister or bureaucrat is facing consequences for this shambles but thousands of students are. Because of this attitude, the public frustration and anger towards those administering the NCEA is continuing to grow,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
