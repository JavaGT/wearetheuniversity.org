<p>What about freedom of association, Mr de Bres?</p>
<p>Thursday 17 Feb 2005</p>
<p>Stephen Franks - Press Releases - Crime &amp; Justice</p>
<p>The longer Helen Clark delays sacking her mate Joris de Bres, the lower will fall the reputation of the Human Rights Commission, ACT Justice spokesman Stephen Franks said today.</p>
<p>The MP was responding to the Race Relations Commissioner&#39;s encouragement of legal steps by a moko wearer to force a hapless business to employ her. &quot;What about freedom of association? What about freedom of expression?&quot; Mr Franks asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr de Bres should tell us why he has not taken up the cudgels on behalf of the business owner, who will now face thousands of dollars in legal costs. Why a privilege for moko wearers that no other fashion follower can claim? Why not uphold the employer&#39;s freedom and human rights?</p>
<p>&quot;Any New Zealander, of course, should be free to wear a moko. Presumably some of them think it makes them more attractive, or they wouldn&#39;t do it. I find them intriguing.</p>
<p>&quot;But equally we should all take personal responsibility for the consequences of our decisions. If I choose not to wash my hair, or clean my shoes, or wear a safety pin through my eyebrow, I am making a statement. I&#39;m saying what I value, or don&#39;t value. Why should government-paid busybodies have power to tell others they are not allowed to draw conclusions and express their own view about me?</p>
<p>&quot;It is well established that freedom of association also means freedom from forced association. Those who disagree with a fashion or political statement should be free to ensure they don&#39;t have it shoved in their face all the time, on their own premises and with their customers.</p>

<p>&quot;Will Mr de Bres insist that an employer or a school or a boarding house must accept a pierced, mohawked, razor blade dangling punk, because they are expressions of his culture?</p>
<p>&quot;The Human Rights Act is fatally flawed. It is simply a license by the politically correct Labour Cabinet to appoint their useless mates to enforce their particular views of society, and to entangle those who disagree with them in a nightmare of legal proceedings,&quot; Mr Franks said.</p>
