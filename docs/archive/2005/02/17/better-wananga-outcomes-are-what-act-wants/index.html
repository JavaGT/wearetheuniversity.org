<p>Better wananga outcomes are what ACT wants</p>
<p>Thursday 17 Feb 2005</p>
<p>Ken Shirley - Press Releases - Other</p>
<p>ACT MP Ken Shirley has totally rejected comments made by Ranginui Walker and Pita Sharples that ACT is beating up on Maori in rasing concerns about Te Wananga O Aotearoa.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT has long and effectively fought on issues of government accountability and how it spends taxpayers&#39; hard-earned money. For five years Labour has failed to scrutinise this particular education provider, preferring to just keep shovelling money at it. That attitude has been to the detriment of taxpayers and Maori students. If anything, ACT is sticking up for Maori students. We only want them to succeed.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT recognises the need for investment in Maori education with an emphasis on improving outcomes. We don&#39;t want any group in society falling through the cracks because of a lack of accountability, executive extravagance, and questionable programmes.</p>
<p>&quot;I think many Maori will be outraged by Pita Sharples&#39; statement that we should accept different standards of accountability when it comes to Maori programmes. As the co-leader of the Maori Party, Mr Sharples is sending out a very bad signal on matters of ethical behaviour and accountability of public money.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT believes in one rule for all. Labour&#39;s dual standards haven&#39;t helped any students at Te Wananga O Aotearoa. Despite what Mr Walker and Sharples think, things need to change for the better. That&#39;s what ACT wants and that&#39;s what all New Zealanders want,&quot; said Mr Shirley.</p>
