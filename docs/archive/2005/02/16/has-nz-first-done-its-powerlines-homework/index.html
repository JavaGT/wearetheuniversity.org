<p>Has NZ First done its powerlines homework?</p>
<p>Green Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons wonders whether New Zealand First has done its homework on transmission lines.</p>
<p>New Zealand First MP Brent Catchpole has today advocated that Transpower&#39;s proposed electricity lines across Waikato and South Auckland be placed underground through residential and semi-rural areas.</p>
<p>&quot;Journalists should ask Brent Catchpole how much his proposal to put some of the lines underground would cost,&quot; Ms Fitzsimons said. &quot;Estimates I have seen put the cost of undergrounding at ten times the cost of overground lines. The Whakamaru to Otahuhu line is currently planned to cost $500 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Is Mr Catchpole really advocating an alternative that would increase many-fold the cost of the transmission lines while doing little to alleviate the many environmental problems the lines create?&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons said the Greens believed good alternatives existed that would make the lines unnecessary.</p>
<p>&quot;These include wood-fired co-generation, direct use of gas in Auckland, peak-load shifting, and much greater energy efficiency. We challenge the Electricity Commission to fund a feasibility study to make sure these alternatives are properly developed and costed. The Commission has a statutory requirement to assess Transpower&#39;s proposal for new lines against the alternatives.&quot;</p>
