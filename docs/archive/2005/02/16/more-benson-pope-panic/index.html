<p>Hon Bill English - National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>16 February 2005</p>
<p>More Benson-Pope panic</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English, says David Benson-Pope has resorted to Trevor Mallard&#39;s and the NZQA&#39;s tactics of labelling any critic of the NCEA as a liar or an idiot.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday in Parliament, I read a section of the minutes of a meeting of the Secondary Principals Leaders Forum where the group expressed grave concerns about NCEA scholarships. Mr Benson-Pope claims that I misrepresented those minutes. If this was the case, Mr Benson-Pope could initiate serious parliamentary proceedings against me. He has not done so.</p>
<p>&quot;I also told Parliament that 10,000 fewer students passed an NCEA Level 2 English standard in 2004 than in 2003. I have never claimed that these 10,000 students automatically missed out on university entrance.</p>
<p>&quot;Finally, I am pleased to hear that school principals and education sector groups are free to voice their concerns during the review process. This will help bring further anomalies to light. I will communicate this to those who have contacted me saying they had been told not to comment.</p>
<p>&quot;As usual, the Minister is pointing the finger everywhere but at himself and his officials that oversee the system. His energy would be much better spent fixing this mess,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
