<p>Vote ACT to dump NCEA</p>
<p>Wednesday 16 Feb 2005</p>
<p>Rodney Hide - Press Releases - Education</p>
<p>ACT Leader Rodney Hide today said it was a bit rich for the National Party to call for an overhaul of the discredited NCEA.</p>
<p>&quot;The previous National-led Government came up with this hare-brained qualifications system, which was then implemented by Labour when it came to office,&quot; Mr Hide said.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike National, ACT has opposed the NCEA from day one. National, in fact, joined Labour in refusing to support an ACT bill in 2003 that sought a moratorium on the NCEA until its flaws could be ironed out.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT believes schools should be given the choice of dumping the NCEA and replacing it with an internationally recognised, exam-based qualifications system.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents and teachers who want to give their children and students the world-class education they deserve, should vote ACT this election,&quot; Mr Hide said.</p>
