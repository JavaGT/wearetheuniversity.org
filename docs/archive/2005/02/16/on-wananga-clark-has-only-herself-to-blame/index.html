<p>On wananga Clark has only herself to blame</p>
<p>Wednesday 16 Feb 2005</p>
<p>Ken Shirley - Press Releases - Other</p>
<p>Helen Clark and her Government are solely to blame for hundreds of extra millions being poured into Te Wananga O Aotearoa, ACT MP Ken Shirley said today.</p>
<p>&quot;It was Labour who opened the door to wanangas getting resourced the same way as New Zealand&#39;s recognised universities. It was Labour who in 2000 accepted the wanangas&#39; claim that the Crown had breached the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
<p>In contrast, under the previous National Government the Education Ministry in 1999 made it clear that while the wanangas had financial struggles there was no breach of the Treaty principles.</p>
<p>&quot;It was under Labour that the highly lucrative funding formula for Te Wananga O Aotearoa got the green light. Wanangas had long been battling for an equal financial footing, but their calls of a Treaty breach had been overruled by a National Government.</p>
<p>&quot;When Helen Clark came to power however the rules changed, closing the gaps became a priority, and the wanangas claim of a Treaty breach was accepted.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Shirley said Labour talks about the Treaty being a living document but more worryingly the Treaty&#39;s principles are a moving feast. ACT believes the same standards should apply to all, regardless of race.</p>
<p>&quot;It was Labour&#39;s redefinition of the Treaty of Waitangi principles in 2000, that saw government funding to Te Wananga O Aotearoa go from $3.9 million to a staggering $239 million.&quot;</p>
<p>Official figures showed the number of formal students enrolled at Te Wananga O Aotearoa increased from 1,770 in July 2000 to 37,915 at the same time last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark is keen to publicly present her concern and wash her hands of it but the blame lies squarely with her,&quot; said Mr Shirley.</p>
