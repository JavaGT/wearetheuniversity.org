<p><strong>Tuesday, 1 February 2005, 10:44 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>New leader for Victoria Management School</p>
<p>Associate Professor John Davies has been appointed as the new Head of the Victoria Management School at Victoria University.</p>
<p>Mr Davies replaces Dr Brad Jackson, who has been appointed as Director of the Centre for the Study of Leadership within the School.</p>
<p>Mr Davies has a BSc(Hons) in Applied Mathematics from the University of Wales and an MA in Operational Research from the University of Lancaster in Britain.</p>
<p>Currently involved in directing post-experience management education programmes within the school, John Davies joined Victoria in 1980 having previously worked at the University of Glamorgan in Wales, local government and as an operational researcher in the cable industry. He is a member of the Wellington Rugby Football Union Rugby Board and former President of both the WRFU and the Poneke Football Club.</p>
<p>Mr Davies has a background in Applied Mathematics, Operational Research and Management Science. His teaching and research relates to various aspects of decision-making, systems approaches to management, and more broadly, sports management. He has studied at the University of Wales and the University of Lancaster in Britain.</p>
<p>Acting Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Commerce &amp; Administration, Professor Peter Thirkell, said the School would continue to focus on being a leader and innovator in research and teaching in management, including its specialist areas of human resources, tourism, and Mâori business.</p>
<p>&quot;The Victoria Management School was the top nominated academic unit in New Zealand for management studies in the release of the Government&#39;s Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) report last year while the University as a whole was first equal in the management, human resources, industrial relations and international business subject area.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Jackson played a key role in the School&#39;s establishment phase and I would like to thank him for his role in the achieving the School&#39;s success in the PBRF and am sure Associate Professor Davies will strive to see that its record for excellence is maintained.&quot;</p>
