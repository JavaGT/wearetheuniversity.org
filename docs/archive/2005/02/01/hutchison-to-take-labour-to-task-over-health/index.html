<p><strong>Tuesday, 1 February 2005, 3:24 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Paul Hutchison<br>National Party Health Spokesman</p>

<p>Hutchison to take Labour to task over health</p>
<p>National&#39;s new Health spokesman, Paul Hutchison, says he looks forward to taking Labour to task over its inefficient and overly bureaucratic health system.</p>
<p>National&#39;s leader, Don Brash, today named Dr Hutchison as Health spokesman, taking over from Judith Collins, who moves into the Welfare portfolio.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has increased health spending by over $3 billion since 1999 and yet tens of thousands of New Zealanders are unable to get the healthcare they need, or even get on a waiting list,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;It is vital that every scarce health dollar is put to best use and National is determined to restore the financial disciplines necessary and to weed out the inefficiencies.</p>
<p>&quot;National is also committed to ensuring there is choice, and that the private sector is used widely, with health contracts awarded based on best quality and price.</p>
<p>&quot;I am particularly interested in ensuring there is emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention, with programmes integrated into life-long education,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>As a former specialist obstetrician and gynaecologist, Dr Hutchison says he regards it as fundamental that children&#39;s health is focused on as a national priority.</p>
