<p>Tony Milne Labour Candidate for Rakaia</p>
<p>02 February 2005</p>

<p>Brian Connell - Rebel without a cause</p>
<p>Labour Candidate for Rakaia, Tony Milne, today challenged Brian Connell to explain his absolute inconsistencies.</p>
<p>&quot;In 2002 Brian Connell told New Zealand it wouldn&#39;t be long before he was the leader of the National Party. In 2003 Brian told us Bill English wasn&#39;t doing a very good job. In 2004 Brian said Lynda Scott was an average MP. Today Mr Connell, speaking on Radio NZ, criticised his own leader&#39;s decision to dump Katherine Rich as &#39;stupid&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Is this all part of Brian&#39;s plan to be leader of the National Party? Is he just upset he&#39;s been overlooked for promotion once again? Brian Connell said Don Brash failed Political Management 101 - he must have got lessons from Brian Connell&quot;. Tony Milne said.</p>
<p>&quot;Just 2 months ago Brian Connell called legislation giving people a fourth week of annual leave &quot;anti-business&quot;, &quot;socialist claptrap&quot; and a &quot;step backwards&quot;. Of the more extraordinary claims Mr Connell had made was that legislation granting four weeks leave would lead to &quot;marriage break-ups, more solo parents, and more kids in crime&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not at all clear what Mr Connell&#39;s stance will be now that the National Party have decided it would be too big a vote loser for them not to support this important legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;If Brian is really the rebel he&#39;s pretending to be, he&#39;ll front up and explain his inconsistencies by standing by his statements of 2 months ago (attached).</p>
<p>&quot;I think the people of Rakaia deserve an explanation from Brian about whether he&#39;s now supporting it, and if he is, why he has made such a dramatic about turn.</p>
<p>&quot;I make a commitment that if I&#39;m elected Rakaia MP this year, I will say what I believe and stick by it&quot;, said Mr Milne. &quot;Politics require principles and the courage to stick by them. The people of Rakaia deserve no less.&quot;</p>

<p>A Selection of Comments from Brian Connell MP for Rakaia on the Holidays Bill (Act):<br>* &quot;Do we need legislation which enables employees to have 4 weeks leave at the expense of the viability of our small businesses? .The answer is simply - No, we do not need these anti-business Bills.&quot;<br>Source: Canterbury Farming, December, 2002.</p>
<p>* &quot;This anti-business, socialist claptrap just has to come to an end. How much flesh do we want from the good, hard working people of this country? This nanny State mentality is killing business. It is turning business away in their droves.&quot;<br>Source: Hansard, 04 December, 2004.</p>
<p>* &quot;So everyone is now to get 4 weeks&#39; holiday. How very generous! It is easy to spend someone else&#39;s money. It absolutely sickens me. This is the type of nanny State interference that is killing business in this country.<br>Source: Hansard, 04 December, 2004.</p>
<p>* &quot;Small business, and by that I mean mums and dads, will pay for this measure by having to work for longer. The social impact - on the family and society - are all too obvious to me. There will be marriage break-ups, more solo parents, more kids in crime.<br>Source: Hansard, 04 December, 2004.</p>
<p>* &quot;Those [government] members should hang their heads in shame, because this is something that this country will pay for, for ever and a day.<br>Source: Hansard, 04 December, 2004.</p>
<p>* &quot;It is the worst type of election bribe. It is cheap politics. This Government will do anything for a vote, despite it knowing that it is not good for the long-term prosperity of this country.<br>Source: Hansard, 09 December, 2004.</p>
<p>* &quot;This is just the tip of the iceberg. We are going to see more and more of this nonsense. I, for one, am prepared to stand up and say that it is just wrong, absolutely wrong. The cost of this measure is horrific, absolutely horrific.<br>Source: Hansard, 09 December, 2004.<br>* &quot;This bill is a step backwards. In fact, it is a step so far back that if we keep doing it we will rediscover dinosaurs. We are in great jeopardy of going back so far with this legislation that we will be in an era where we are completely uncompetitive.&quot;<br>Source: Hansard, 09 December, 2004.</p>
<p>* &quot;This legislation is appalling. It is ill advised, poorly thought out, and poorly conceived.&quot;<br>Source: Hansard, 09 December, 2004.</p>
