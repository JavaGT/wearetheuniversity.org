<p>Govt should implement car disposal plan immediately</p>
<p>Green Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons is applauding the Motor Trade Association for promoting a nationally-co-ordinated car disposal system and is calling on the Government to champion the cause.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand&#39;s rivers, lakes, and streams are regularly contaminated because car owners have no financial incentive to ensure their vehicles are disposed in a responsible way,&quot; Ms Fitzsimons said.</p>
<p>New Zealand needed to follow European countries and Japan in placing a decommissioning charge on all new vehicles.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to reduce the number of cars being dumped in our waterways at great environmental cost. A very effective way of doing this is to have people pay a deposit when buying new cars, to be recouped once the car is returned to a designated recycling and disposal centre. That encourages people to properly dispose of their old vehicles, rather than just dump them in their nearest stream or river.</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons said that it was of great concern that tens of thousands of cars were being abandoned every year.</p>
<p>&quot;When a car reaches the end of its life, we want to encourage the recovery of materials that can be re-used and the safe disposal of the rest. The Government has been saying for years that it intends to deal with this issue, but we still haven&#39;t seen any actions to fit those fine words. I urge them to take up the cause immediately.&quot;</p>
