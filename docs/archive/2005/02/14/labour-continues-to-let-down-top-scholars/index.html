<p>Hon Bill English - National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>14 February 2005</p>
<p>Labour continues to let down top scholars</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English, today repeated his call for the Education Minister to refund all NCEA scholarship reassessment fees.</p>
<p>Students have only until tomorrow to resubmit their exam papers, at a cost of $20 per paper.</p>
<p>&quot;David Benson-Pope&#39;s dithering over my proposal to drop or refund the reassessment fee shows how blind he is to the effects this debacle has had on students.&quot;</p>
<p>Last week Labour said it would look into dropping the reassessment fee.</p>
<p>&quot;But that&#39;s not good enough when the deadline for the reassessment of scholarship papers is tomorrow. Even if Labour announces today that they will drop the fee, all but a handful of students will miss out, as they will have already paid. Those students must be reimbursed,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Last week, Labour had the opportunity to demonstrate some goodwill towards the students whose qualifications are affected. Instead, Mr Benson-Pope chose to point the finger at anyone and everyone.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has let these young people down. It&#39;s hardly fair to expect them to now pay for reassurance that they aren&#39;t the victims of a botched system&quot;.</p>
