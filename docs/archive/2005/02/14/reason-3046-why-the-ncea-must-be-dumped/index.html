<p>Reason 3,046 why the NCEA must be dumped</p>
<p>Monday 14 Feb 2005 Deborah Coddington Press Releases -- Education</p>
<p>Political correctness in the so-called exam system of NCEA has surely reached its limit in the marking of the Scholarship papers, ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve been forwarded a copy of the Chemistry &#39;answer booklet&#39; (NZQA-speak for exam paper) by a student who failed to achieve a scholarship pass,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;However, she has no idea how much she failed by because the &#39;overall level of performance&#39; box is simply marked with &#39;N&#39; - Not Achieved.</p>
<p>&quot;Does she bother to try again? Maybe she missed by a few marks; maybe she was miles out. She&#39;ll never know because the whole stupid philosophy of the standards-based assessment is that students can&#39;t be ranked against each other.</p>
<p>&quot;That might make someone feel bad about themselves, simply because someone else achieved a better mark.</p>
<p>&quot;In the language of the students themselves, this stinks.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time to stop treating our senior secondary students like idiots and bring back an exam system that doesn&#39;t insult their intelligence and their robustness.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time to dump the NCEA,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
