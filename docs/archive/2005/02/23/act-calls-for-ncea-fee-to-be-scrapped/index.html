<p>ACT calls for NCEA fee to be scrapped</p>
<p>ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington today called on the Labour Party to do the decent thing and waive the NCEA scholarship reassessment fee.</p>
<p>Students unhappy with their NCEA scholarship results can pay $30 per paper to have them reassessed.</p>
<p>&quot;Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope told Parliament on 10 February that he would consider scrapping the fee upon seeking further advice,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;Today I received a phone call from an angry parent who phoned Education Minister Trevor Mallard&#39;s office, the Education Ministry and the NZQA, to find out whether the fee was still in place.</p>
<p>&quot;The parent was told by Mallard&#39;s office that no decision had been made. She then called the Ministry who told her that she&#39;d still need to pay $90 to get three papers remarked.</p>
<p>&quot;What a disgrace. Twelve days on and the Government is still floundering. I call on the Labour Party and Benson-Pope to stop dithering and scrap the fee now,&quot; said Miss Coddington.  </p>
