<p>Director Of Human Resources Announced</p>
<p>University of Otago Vice-Chancellor, Professor David Skegg, has announced the appointment of Kevin Seales as the new Director of Human Resources for the University.</p>
<p>Mr Seales is currently Human Resources Manager at Otago Polytechnic, where he has been responsible for bringing together all the Polytechnic’s human resource functions into one unit as well as dealing with significant change in the organisation. Before joining the Polytechnic in 2000 he was with the Dunedin City Council, and prior to that spent a number of years in the hotel industry.</p>
<p>“The Human Resources Division has a vital role at the University of Otago. Kevin Seales has proven ability in both strategic and operational human resource management and I am very pleased that he has accepted this appointment,” says Professor Skegg.</p>
<p>“He also has extensive knowledge of the tertiary sector which will be extremely valuable in this role.”</p>
<p>Mr Seales has a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Canterbury, a post graduate Certificate in Business Administration, and is completing a Master of Business Administration from Edinburgh Business School. He will take up the appointment in April.</p>
