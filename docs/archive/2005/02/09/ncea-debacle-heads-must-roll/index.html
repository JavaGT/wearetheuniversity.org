<p>NCEA Debacle: Heads must roll</p>
<p>Wednesday 9 Feb 2005</p>
<p>Deborah Coddington - Press Releases - Education</p>
<p>ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington today called for heads to roll at the NZQA over the NCEA scholarship results debacle.</p>
<p>&quot;Since Trevor Mallard and David Benson-Pope refuse to take any responsibility for the shambles, it is reasonable then to assume the cause of the problem lies with the NZQA.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s simply not good enough that students who have slogged their guts out for a year to achieve top marks have been mucked about.</p>
<p>&quot;The NZQA has been clearly negligent in moderating the NCEA scholarship examination system.</p>
<p>&quot;Ninety-nine percent of students who sat biology didn&#39;t get a scholarship because the NZQA stuffed up. This is child abuse of the mind. Further, it is a huge let-down for teachers.</p>
<p>&quot;At the very least these exam papers should be recalled, re-marked and scaled. The students deserve some justice. The Government is not thinking about the children who have been stuffed around here.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Labour Government won&#39;t put its hand up and take responsibility for this mess, then it&#39;s time someone from the NZQA falls on their sword,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
