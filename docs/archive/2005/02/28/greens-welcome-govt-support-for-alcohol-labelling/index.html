<p>Greens welcome Govt support for alcohol labelling</p>
<p>Green MP Nandor Tanczos is welcoming Associate Health Minister Damien O&#39;Connor&#39;s announcement today that compulsory alcohol safety labelling will be introduced if the industry&#39;s proposed voluntary scheme doesn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>Speaking at the &#39;Alcohol Policy Roundtable&#39; at Parliament, Mr O&#39;Connor said he expects to soon see &#39;mock ups&#39; of the industry&#39;s proposed labelling warning of the dangers of drinking while pregnant.</p>
<p>&quot;Its good news that the Government is willing to introduce a compulsory scheme if the voluntary scheme doesn&#39;t take,&quot; said Nandor, the Green Party&#39;s Drug Law Reform Spokesperson and one of the hosts of today&#39;s Roundtable.</p>
<p>&quot;A danger with a voluntary approach is that it may downplay the impact of alcohol on society. We&#39;ve heard today that alcohol is a causal factor in around 60 types of illness, injury and death, so its essential that combating its abuse is taken seriously. &quot;In particular, research now indicates there is no safe alcohol limit for pregnant women, so labelling that warns about the dangers of foetal alcohol syndrome has to be hard line.</p>
<p>&quot;While Mr O&#39;Connor&#39;s support for labelling is good, it will only work if its part of a broader, coordinated package. The Government must also look at a ban on alcohol advertising on TV and better enforcement of sales rules, particularly the current age limit.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether the scheme is voluntary or compulsory, the labelling of imported alcohol products is also going to have to be addressed,&quot; said Nandor.</p>
