<p>Let NZ marry our future king</p>
<p>ACT Justice spokesman Stephen Franks said today he will try to sell the advantages of marrying in New Zealand to Prince Charles when he meets MPs next week.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m always keen to promote the export of New Zealand services. We have a clear competitive advantage. Thousands of Japanese couples have already shown the way,&quot; Mr Franks said.</p>
<p>&quot;He must feel that everyone in Britain is conspiring to make his marriage a misery for him. Our law is more user-friendly. We have thousands of celebrants scrabbling for business. They are allowed to marry people pretty much wherever they choose. It doesn&#39;t have to be in some registry office that killjoys can insist on forcing their way into.</p>
<p>&quot;Wellington at least knows how to throw a good party - just look at the rugby sevens. There would be genuine universal goodwill. We have no worries about him ending up as the head of any State-established church here, so even those still sour on him could just not think about it.</p>
<p>&quot;Distance should be no object since his Mum doesn&#39;t want to attend any way, but she might change her mind if he chooses an upmarket NZ beauty spot instead of a dreary registry office.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m sure Labour&#39;s ruling circles would promise enormous sponsorship if he agreed to cut the ribbon on their new civil union status, by civilly uniting at the end of April when the new law takes effect.</p>
<p>&quot;Or instead he could just spend a few nights with Camilla here and become a Kiwi de facto. That way he gets most of the rights and burdens of marriage automatically, whether he wants them or not, under Labour&#39;s drive to eliminate legal discrimination on the basis of marital status.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course no one yet knows what is left of marriage after Attorney-General Margaret Wilson&#39;s tinkering of the past few years, but that shouldn&#39;t worry Prince Charles and Camilla, because they can take their relationship back to be governed by their familiar UK law,&quot; Mr Franks said.  </p>
