<p>April 1st no joke for pre-school providers</p>
<p>Monday 28 Feb 2005</p>
<p>Deborah Coddington - Press Releases - Education</p>
<p>In what must be the cruellest April Fools trick ever, Labour has decided 1 April is the final day for early childhood centres to comply with a raft of complicated recording, reporting and record-keeping rules, ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry of Education couldn&#39;t get its act together in terms of finalising these rules until mid-February, yet the already overburdened individuals at the coalface of early childhood education are being given only six weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the latest savage blow from Education Minister Trevor Mallard, who appears determined to crush the early childhood sector,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#39;s already dictated that all &#39;persons of responsibility&#39; must have an NZQA qualification in early childhood teaching - even if they have a primary teaching degree and years of experience.</p>
<p>&quot;Then he brought in mandatory registration for early childhood teachers, plus new employment law changes.</p>
<p>&quot;This year the Government is bringing in national ID numbers for our pre-schoolers. Last week I was contacted by several playcentres who have to spend up to $1,000 for permission to erect things like shade cloths.</p>
<p>&quot;Of education spending, only about five percent goes on our under-fives, yet those years are the most crucial in terms of a child&#39;s development.</p>

<p>&quot;Labour has blown more than quarter of a billion dollars on just one so-called Maori university in one year, yet it couldn&#39;t care less about many children who&#39;ll never make it to the gates of tertiary education.</p>
<p>&quot;The early childhood education sector was once a fine example of funding following the child and parents having choice. The Labour Government, with its we-know-best attitude, is destroying the choices for many families. It should just, as the kids say, butt out,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
