<p>“The Government’s direction is clear: university status requires demonstrable evidence of research activism and contributions to knowledge. As such, the business faculty’s research profile deserves a prominent place among its strategic management developments,” he says.</p>
<p>Professor Lange’s areas of expertise include labour markets – skills and policy, economics, employment policies, skill shortages, and unemployment versus immigrant issues.</p>
