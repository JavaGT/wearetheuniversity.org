<p>Simon Power - National Party Associate Education Spokesman</p>
<p>2 February 2005</p>
<p>NZQA sings from Labour&#39;s songsheet</p>
<p>National&#39;s Associate Education spokesman, Simon Power, says Labour&#39;s handling of concerns about the political bias of the NZQA has been insulting and irresponsible.</p>
<p>He is referring to an NCEA Level 1 History question asking students to choose two of three people from whose perspective they were to write: two prominent Maori leaders - Dame Whina Cooper and Eva Rickard - and &#39;A National Party Member of Parliament not sympathetic to Maori concerns&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;This question asks the student to make assumptions based on an unfair political stereotype and I want to know what, in the curriculum, those assumptions will be based on,&quot; says Mr Power.</p>
<p>&quot;Both the Minister and the NZQA have been cavalier in their dismissal of concerns of political interference. That&#39;s not good enough when the education of our young people are concerned.</p>
<p>&quot;This isn&#39;t an isolated incident - an NCEA Economics exam question asked students to explain why free-market policies created inequality - another example of political slant.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the second time in less than six months that the NZQA has taken a swipe at the National Party. They are behaving like a branch of the Labour Party.&quot;</p>
<p>In October the NZQA displayed a press release sharply critical of National&#39;s position on the NCEA on the opening page of its website. The press release was taken down after complaints about its partisan nature.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks very much like the education of our children is based on petty political bias and I will not allow that to continue,&quot; says Mr Power.</p>
<p>&quot;The NZQA should stop wasting time trying to discredit the National Party&#39;s concerns, and indeed the concerns of parents and employers, and get on with the job of fixing their deeply flawed system.&quot;</p>
