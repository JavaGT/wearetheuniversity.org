<p>ACT on Campus slams impotent NZUSA for focussing on problems not solutions</p>
<p>ACT on Campus today called on New Zealand University Association leaders to remain open minded about ACT policy and how it will help graduates says Michael Collins, the ACT on Campus National Coordinator.</p>
<p>Collins claims that with ACT’s tax policy, a graduate earning $40,000 will have an extra $35.86 per week in their pay packet.</p>
<p>“This would undoubtedly be a huge boost to those with student loans to pay off. In fact if all of that extra money was put towards student loan repayments, then the average loan can be paid off in almost half the time saving $2,000 in interest.”</p>
<p>Collins also points out Treasury has calculated that ACT’s policies will lead to a 1% increase in economic growth, delivering more prosperity and opportunity to everyone – especially graduates.</p>
<p>&quot;We share NZUSA&#39;s concerns, we want New Zealanders to be able to afford the things they want, including quality education. However instead of attacking every political party under the sun as NZUSA do, ACT is offering policies based on good economics and rewarding success.&quot;<br>Collins says he believes it is time for NZUSA to place an emphasis on policies, which will help students pay off their debt and get ahead when they graduate.</p>
<p>“It’s about time NZUSA pulled their heads out of the sand. Currently their practice of simply pointing out how large student loans are is tired and makes me think whether they actually care about solutions to the problems at all.”</p>
