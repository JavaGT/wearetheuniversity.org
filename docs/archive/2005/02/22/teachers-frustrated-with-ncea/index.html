<p>Teachers frustrated with NCEA</p>
<p>National’s Education spokesman, Bill English, says a new wave of teacher complaints about the NCEA show the problems with the qualification are much wider than those surrounding the scholarship exam.</p>
<p>The latest edition of PPTA News, the PPTA’s magazine, has four pages of complaints from teachers about the troubles associated with the assessment and administration of the NCEA.</p>
<p>“These are real problems experienced at the coal-face and identified by teachers who are generally supportive of the NCEA. Labour cannot afford to dismiss these concerns as ignorance, as they have with those raised by everyone else,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“The problems identified by the PPTA explain why they have asked for the NCEA review to be extended to include levels 1, 2 and 3 of the qualification.”</p>
<p>According to PPTA News, teachers want ‘better assessment, a moderation system that teachers feel supports them, and funding that meets schools’ costs’ so they can deliver NCEA effectively.</p>
<p>The PPTA conclude by saying ‘There is no groundswell amongst teachers to dump the NCEA, but the consensus around the qualification is still fragile’.</p>
<p>“I have had a flood of teachers coming to me with the same concerns for months. Hopefully this open public debate will give air to their concerns and force Labour to take note,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“Labour says parents complain about the NCEA because they don’t understand it. But they cannot dismiss the concerns of teachers who deal with the system every day. Labour must listen to teachers rather than try to dodge the blame for the lack of public confidence.</p>
<p>“According to the PPTA, teachers ‘will be looking for the Government to make the changes that will help this qualifications system fulfil its potential’. But many teachers want more than that – they want an overhaul of the NCEA so it’s fair for students and practical for teachers,” says Mr English.</p>
