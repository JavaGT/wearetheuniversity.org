<p>Forum to discuss merits of faith-based prisons</p>
<p>A forum on the place of faith-based prisons and the role of spirituality in rehabilitation and personal change will be held at Auckland University of Technology later this week.</p>
<p>Warwick Pudney, senior lecturer in Violence and Trauma studies at AUT’s School of Psychotherapy, will facilitate the forum.</p>
<p>“The sorts of questions we will be asking are: how successful are these programmes, what is the place of spirituality in personal life change, and how could I include spirituality in my work?” says Warwick Pudney.</p>
<p>One of the panel members is Kim Workman who has worked as a Police Senior Sergeant, Youth Aid Officer, Assistant Secretary (Penal Institutions) Department of Justice, Deputy Director General (Maori Health) with the Ministry of Health and as a public policy consultant. In 2000 Kim was appointed to the position of Executive Director, Prison Fellowship at the faith-based unit, Rimutaka Prison in after care prison services.</p>
<p>Another of the speakers is Rob Burt who has been an assistant teacher of vipassana meditation and has been involved with Ihi Tu, a prison programme for male prisoners in New Plymouth.</p>
<p>AUT lecturer and church leader Russell Waetford is also on the panel and will share his expertise gained as a member of the NZ Domestic Violence Programmes Approval Panel and contractor for prison programmes in two Auckland prisons.</p>
