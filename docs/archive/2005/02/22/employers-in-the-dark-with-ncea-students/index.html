<p>Wayne Mapp - National Party Industrial Relations Spokesman</p>
<p>22 February 2005</p>
<p>Employers in the dark with NCEA students</p>
<p>National&#39;s Industrial Relations spokesman, Wayne Mapp, says Labour and the NZQA must take the concerns of employers on board as part of their inquiry into discrepancies in the NCEA.</p>
<p>His comments come after Trade Staff, the nationwide employment agency, said it found the NCEA &#39;confusing&#39; and &#39;irrelevant&#39; and that some employers are arranging for potential employees to undergo extra testing.</p>
<p>This follows the release of an NZQA report late last year which found only one fifth of employers feel positive about the NCEA.</p>
<p>&quot;If Labour is serious about employment and economic growth, it will take the concerns of employers on board to ensure the NCEA is relevant to the real world and that standards are consistent, fair and high,&quot; says Dr Mapp.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently, employers are in the dark when employing students with NCEA qualifications. The result sheet is unintelligible to the point where NZQA should consider starting an interpretation course for employers.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s removal of failure from NCEA records and its inability to guarantee that one student&#39;s results at one school will mean the same at another school, or that standards across subjects are equal, has created an absolute nightmare for employers.</p>
<p>&quot;Last week Don Brash committed the next National Government to a fundamental review and overhaul of the NCEA to restore confidence and standards. This is essential to New Zealand&#39;s economic success and well being,&quot; says Dr Mapp.</p>
