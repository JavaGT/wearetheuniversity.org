<p>10 February 2005<br>Media invitation to meet the candidates</p>
<p>Green Co-Leaders to speak at Campaign Conference</p>
<p>Green Co-Leaders Rod Donald and Jeanette Fitzsimons will be highlighting election year challenges in speeches at an open session of the Party&#39;s Campaign Conference in Auckland this weekend (11 - 14 Feb).</p>
<p>The media is also invited to &#39;mix and mingle&#39; with the Green Party&#39;s 2005 candidates at an informal lunch prior to the speeches.</p>
<p>The Campaign Conference will include two and a half days of training for candidates and campaign managers and one day for the initial ranking of the Greens&#39; Party List.</p>
<p>The list ranking process will begin with the candidates presenting themselves to the Party&#39;s electorate delegates. The delegates, along with the Party&#39;s Leadership Group (the Co-Leaders, Co-Conveners and Policy Co-Conveners) and the candidates themselves will then have two weeks to vote for the Initial List. This is then provided as a guide to the full Party membership when they vote in an STV election in a few weeks time. Selection of electorate candidates is already well under way around the country.</p>
<p>Green Party Campaign Manager Dr Russel Norman said, &quot;The Greens&#39; preparations for this year&#39;s election are far more advanced than they were at the equivalent time prior to the 2002 vote and we are confident of presenting a strong team of candidates backed by well-prepared local campaign teams&quot;.</p>
<p>Of the 45 candidates currently approved to stand in the election, 19 are female; four are Maori; seven are gay; 38 have tertiary level education; 22 have joined the Party since 2000, and their ages range from 29 to early sixties.</p>
<p>The Greens&#39; AGM and full Conference will be held in Christchurch at Queens Birthday Weekend, 4-6 June.</p>
<p>What: Green Co-Leaders speeches and Candidate introductions at the Green Campaign Conference</p>
<p>When: Lunch with the candidates 1pm, Co-Leaders&#39; speeches 2pm, this Sunday, 13 February</p>
<p>Where: Whai Ora Marae, 14a Otara Road, Otara, Auckland</p>
