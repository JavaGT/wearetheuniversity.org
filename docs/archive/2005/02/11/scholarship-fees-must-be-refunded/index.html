<p><strong>Friday, 11 February 2005, 3:59 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Bill English - National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>11 February 2005</p>
<p>Scholarship fees must be refunded</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English, says students who have already paid for their scholarship exam papers to be reassessed should be refunded.</p>
<p>Students have until Tuesday to resubmit their exam papers, at a cost of $20 per paper.</p>
<p>Labour says it is looking into waiving the fee in light of controversy surrounding discrepancies with the exams but Mr English says that isn&#39;t good enough because most students will have already paid the fee.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has ripped these students off enough with changes to the monetary awards.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier this week Labour admitted there were considerable discrepancies in the NCEA scholarship exams, with some subjects being awarded significantly more pass marks than others.</p>
<p>400 students have subsequently been awarded &#39;Distinction Awards&#39; as compensation. It is not known what weight these awards will carry with tertiary institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s hardly fair to now expect students to pay for reassurance that they aren&#39;t the victims of a botched system. The fees must go,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
