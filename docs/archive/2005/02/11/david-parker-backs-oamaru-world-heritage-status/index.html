<p>David Parker MP for Otago</p>
<p>Media Statement 10 February 2005</p>
<p>David Parker backs World Heritage Status for Oamaru</p>
<p>Otago MP David Parker today threw his weight behind calls for World Heritage Status to be granted to Oamaru’s harbour and historic buildings.</p>
<p>“It can only be a good thing,” Mr Parker said. “Oamaru has a very important place in New Zealand’s history and I believe we should treasure what is already a treasure.”</p>
<p>World Heritage Status can only have positive gains for the district, he said. It will build local pride, bring tourism advantages and make Oamaru more wealthy. It would also assist Oamaru in its efforts to preserve and further improve its heritage buildings.</p>
<p>Oamaru’s historic buildings and harbour have been nominated as one of six New Zealand locations being considered by the government which wants public feedback before making nominations to the World Heritage Committee.</p>
<p>Mr Parker said Oamaru had a wonderful historical tale to tell, with its frozen meat, wool and grain export history.</p>
<p>Mr Parker said he was pleased that the Waitaki District Council policy and monitoring committee had decided to back world heritage status. “I will do everything I can to draw attention to the importance of Oamaru on the national and international map,” he said. Submissions on the issue are to be sent to the Department of Conservation in Wellington by 31 March.</p>
