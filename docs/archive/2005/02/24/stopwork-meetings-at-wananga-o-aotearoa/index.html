<p>Stopwork Meetings at Wananga o Aotearoa</p>
<p>Highly Successful</p>
<p>Ma whero, ma pango, ka oti te mahi - together we can do it!</p>
<p>ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa (the professional association and union that covers staff across the tertiary sector including Wananga) is very pleased with the level of interest from members attending stopwork meetings at Te Wananga o Aotearoa campuses across the North Island this week.</p>
<p>“ Obviously we are very pleased that our members are so supportive of the proposed collective employment agreement claim, but we are also delighted with the interest shown by other staff who are not as yet members, but wish to join” Lloyd Woods the National President of Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa said today.</p>
<p>“ In doing so they will support their colleagues in this campaign for conditions of employment and professionalism common in other parts of the sector” he added.</p>
<p>ASTE is working towards the start of negotiations as soon as possible following endorsement of the claim. Bargaining for the new collective agreement was initiated in early November last year.</p>
<p>“ It has taken some time to get Wananga management to proceed with these negotiations but we expect that they will now in good faith engage in a timely manner and we look forward to successful and fruitful negotiations.”  </p>
