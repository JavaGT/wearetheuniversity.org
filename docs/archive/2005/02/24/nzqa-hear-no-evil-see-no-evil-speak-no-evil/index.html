<p>NZQA: hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil</p>
<p>National’s Education spokesman, Bill English, says parents and students can have no confidence in the NZQA’s ideas about fair NCEA results.</p>
<p>He is commenting on an NZQA media statement claiming that the variability in NCEA level 1 and 2 results was expected.</p>
<p>Mr English says there is a huge gap between the NZQA’s theoretically perfect NCEA and the real world of parents, students and teachers where inconsistency in results is seen as unfair and potentially damaging.</p>
<p>“Even teachers who generally support the NCEA are losing confidence due to inconsistencies in NCEA standards and assessments.”</p>
<p>The latest edition of PPTA News, the PPTA’s magazine, has four pages of complaints from teachers about the troubles associated with the assessment and administration of the NCEA.</p>
<p>“Surely 20 standards with a variation of more than 20% is something that even the NZQA would worry about.</p>
<p>“In the real world, students have to wear the consequences of this variation.</p>
<p>“But NZQA’s see know evil, hear no evil, speak no evil approach to the NCEA is the problem, not the solution for these students.</p>
<p>“Until Labour and the NZQA accept that their theory-based approach to standards-based assessment will not work in the real world, students will remain at risk in a system that doesn’t do them justice,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>National is committed to a thorough review and overhaul of the NCEA.</p>
