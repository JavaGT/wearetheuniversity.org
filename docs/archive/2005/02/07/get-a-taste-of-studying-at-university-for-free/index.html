<p>Get a taste of studying at university for free</p>
<p>3 February 2005</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury is offering 50 people the chance to study a University paper for free.</p>
<p>Student Services Equity and Access Manager Carolyn Ford, who has supervised the One Free Paper initiative, says in the past a large number of students came to university who had unreal expectations of their ability to take on full-time study alongside family life or work commitments</p>
<p>“The fee subsidised paper, now gives them a realistic view of student life and time frames involved,” Mrs Ford says.</p>
<p>Last year the University undertook a pilot programme offering one fee subsidised first year paper to adult students over 20 years of age who had never previously undertaken university study.</p>
<p>The purpose of the pilot was to allow students the opportunity to make sure university study was for them, before committing to a large financial outlay. It also provided the chance to find out what being a university student involved in the way of time and commitment.</p>
<p>This year the University will repeat the successful programme, which also offers mentoring, computing and study skills support.</p>
<p>Georgina Neither, a participant in the pilot in 2004, says it made a huge impact on her life.</p>
<p>“This was an awesome opportunity and it has allowed me to make clear decisions about my future,” says Georgina, who has pre-enrolled for four papers in 2005.</p>
