<p>Paul Hutchison - National Party MP for Port Waikato</p>
<p>5 February 2005</p>
<p>Plan for killer road insufficient</p>
<p>A plan by Transit, the Police and Transport New Zealand to confront conditions on State Highway 2 at Maramarua will not solve the horrendous problems facing drivers, says Port Waikato MP Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;It is frightening to think there have been more than 35 deaths on this stretch of highway in just five years, and yet the four lane highway that is really needed will not happen for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday&#39;s announcement of increased warning signage, targeted police enforcement of the speed limit, and a trial speed limit reduction is totally inadequate in the long run - given the increasing demands on the road by weekend Auckland traffic,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;Weekend motorists to the Coromandel can expect massive hold-ups if the speed limit is reduced, and increased usage of marginal country roads that will only lead to more deaths.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister of Transport needs to urgently address the long-term problems faced by this killer highway, as the short-sighted current plan is dismally inadequate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I challenge Labour to revise its dangerous catch-up plans for this highway, and instead commit to the responsible completion of a four-lane expressway, otherwise we will continue to witness preventable deaths,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
