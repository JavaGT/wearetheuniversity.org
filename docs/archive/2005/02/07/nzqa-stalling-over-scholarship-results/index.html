<p>NZQA stalling over scholarship results</p>
<p>NZQA and the Associate Minister of Education are still stalling over dealing with dodgy NCEA scholarship results, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>Schools have not received national NCEA results despite a promise from David Benson-Pope last week in Parliament and an official circular from NZQA saying that results comparing each school against national trends would be available by last Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;NZQA should quit stalling and release the results. Without them, schools and students have no way of knowing how well they performed nationally,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>Last week schools revealed that students who had failed Level 3 graphics won scholarships, a student who had never attended a class won a geography scholarship, and that very few scholarships had been awarded in science subjects.</p>
<p>&quot;I am now advised that though there were very few science scholarships awarded, more than 60% of students who sat the accounting scholarship exam won scholarships,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;I am also told failure rates in Level 2 English have jumped from about 30% to 70% because it was a harder exam than Level 3 English.</p>
<p>&quot;Schools are reporting huge differences in their internal and external assessment results. Something has clearly gone wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;Students are finalising their decisions this week on subject choices for the year, while speculation and unease continues to mount.</p>
<p>&quot;The sooner NZQA releases the results, the sooner schools can identify problems and the sooner those problems can begin to be ironed out,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
