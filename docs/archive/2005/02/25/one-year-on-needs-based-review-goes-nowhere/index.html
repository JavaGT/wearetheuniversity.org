<p>Gerry Brownlee MP - National Party Maori Affairs Spokesman</p>
<p>25 February 2005</p>
<p>One year on &#39;needs-based&#39; review goes nowhere</p>
<p>&quot;One year after Helen Clark appointed Trevor Mallard to conduct a review of race based policies, nothing has changed,&quot; says National Party Maori Affairs spokesman Gerry Brownlee.</p>
<p>&quot;Even the Minister charged with ending the nonsense, Mr Mallard, is looking for an electorate secretary who has a &#39;commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi&#39;, who &#39;demonstrates an awareness of the implications of the Treaty&#39;, and who &#39;recognises and acknowledges the contribution of Maori staff&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;As predicted, Labour has completely failed to deliver any meaningful review of its race based policies,&quot; says Mr Brownlee, who has also conducted an audit of recent Government jobs advertised on a single day in Wellington&#39;s major newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;Some reference to the Treaty of Waitangi appeared in at least 10 of the departmental job ads placed in recruitment section, covering nearly 30 different positions.</p>
<p>&quot;The tally of 10 doesn&#39;t include advertisements from organisations that Labour will distance itself from, like universities, training institutes and health boards.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark was never serious about her so-called review of race-based policies and that&#39;ll be further underlined when Labour seeks to delay Parliament&#39;s discussion of the Bill proposing the deletion of Treaty principles from legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;All Trevor Mallard has done is issue lists of departments that have conducted, or are conducting, their own internal reviews. At the same time he&#39;s fired cheap political blanks at things like school powhiri.</p>
<p>&quot;Only National can be trusted to deliver policies based on need not race,&quot; says Mr Brownlee.</p>
