<p>National applauds backdown on helicopters</p>
<p>National Party MPs Simon Power and Tony Ryall say they are delighted that ACC has backed down on a plan that could have seen several rural rescue helicopters axed.</p>
<p>ACC was recommending changes to the operation of rescue helicopters in rural areas that could have seen Palmerston North and the central North Island without nearby services.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a victory for the thousands of people who signed the petition to keep the helicopters and a crucial victory for those who live in isolated rural areas,&quot; Mr Ryall, National&#39;s police spokesman, says.</p>
<p>&quot;The only disappointment was that it took the Government so long to listen to the people who would have been affected.&quot;</p>
<p>Rangitikei MP Mr Power says he is delighted with the result of the hard-fought campaign in Horowhenua, Rangitikei and Manawatu.</p>
<p>&quot;Special thanks must go to Nathan Guy, the National candidate for Otaki, whose initiative in starting the petition was crucial, and to Anne Tolley, National&#39;s East Coast candidate, for her hard work.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government&#39;s complete surrender is overdue and most welcome,&quot; Mr Power says.</p>
<p>&quot;In election year, this Government will U-turn on anything after public pressure.&quot;</p>
