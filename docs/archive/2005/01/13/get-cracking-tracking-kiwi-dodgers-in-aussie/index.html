<p>Get cracking tracking Kiwi dodgers in Aussie</p>
<p>National Party Welfare spokeswoman Katherine Rich says the Government must &quot;get cracking tracking the Kiwi dodgers of child support payments who have escaped to Australia&quot;.</p>
<p>According to figures released to Mrs Rich by the Government, the amount of unpaid child support debt owed by New Zealand&#39;s absent parents in Australia has increased by more than 53% in a year.</p>
<p>&quot;This Labour Government claims to be cracking down on unpaid child support debt in Australia. These figures show they have yet to get cracking at all.&quot;</p>
<p>There are currently 5,197 liable parents living in Australia owing nearly $113 million dollars to Kiwi kids and the taxpayer. That is up from $73 million last year, a massive increase of about $40 million. The figure continues to spiral out of control while Kiwi children are disadvantaged.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister must also explain why the Government knows of 5,197 liable parents in Australia, yet only 3,633 cases worth around $92 million have been referred to Australian collection agencies,&quot; says Mrs Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is letting 1564 child support dodgers living in Australia walk away from their responsibilities owing more than $20 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is all talk and no action when it comes to welfare. They owe it to the thousands of disadvantaged Kiwi kids to make a real effort to collect this money,&quot; says Mrs Rich.</p>
<p>Parliamentary Question: 16843 (2004) Katherine Rich to the Associate Minister of Revenue: How many New Zealand liable parents are living in Australia and how much child support is currently owed/outstanding by ex-pat New Zealanders living in Australia? Hon David Cunliffe (Associate Minister of Revenue) replied: As at 20 October 2004, Inland Revenue Child Support has confirmed that there are 5,197 liable parents living in Australia with a total debt value of $112,674,110, of which $49,577,387 is assessment debt and $63,096,723 is penalty debt. Of these, 3,633 cases with a total debt value of $91,876,501 have been referred to the Australian Child Support Agency under the reciprocal agreement for collection.</p>
<p>Parliamentary Question 9246 (2003). Hon David Cunliffe (Associate Minister of Revenue) replied: There is currently a total of $73,207,549 in outstanding child support and penalties owed by New Zealand liable parents known to be living in Australia.</p>
