<p>Simon Power<br>National Party Associate Education Spokesman</p>

<p>Labour brainwashes young students</p>
<p>National&#39;s Associate Education spokesman, Simon Power, says the NCEA has become another vehicle for Labour to brainwash young New Zealanders.</p>
<p>Mr Power has obtained a Level 1 NCEA history paper which contains the following question on Maori and Pakeha relations:</p>
<p>It is 1980. You are a researcher who has been investigating Maori issues during the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>Choose TWO people from the list below. For each person, write what they would have said for each of the questions that follow. ...</p>
<p>Person 1: A National Party Member of Parliament not sympathetic to Maori concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not only blatant politicking but quite incorrect. The assumption that National is not concerned with Maori issues is totally wrong,&quot; says Mr Power.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an outrage. Our children should be protected from this kind of overt political propaganda and someone must be held accountable.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour devote much of their time trying to avoid stereotyping women, Maori and other minority groups but they&#39;re happy to label National Party members as &#39;unsympathetic to Maori&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;The NCEA should not be a vehicle for brainwashing students with left-wing ideas. Labour should be more concerned with fixing the problems with the qualification and ensuring quality and consistency of qualification than trying desperately to firm-up their support for future elections.</p>
<p>&quot;The NZQA has some very serious questions to answer and I will raise them directly with the organization through the Education and Science Select Committee,&quot; says Mr Power</p>
