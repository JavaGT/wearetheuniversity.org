<p>Universal benefit should include students</p>
<p>Green MP Nandor Tanczos has welcomed the announcement of a universal benefit to simplify welfare entitlements but called on the Government to extend it to full-time tertiary students.</p>
<p>&quot;The only adults in society who are unable to take full-time work but excluded from the benefit system are tertiary students,&quot; said Nandor, Green Tertiary Education Spokesperson. &quot;It&#39;s time for this inequity to be addressed.</p>
<p>&quot;The announcement of this universal benefit provides the Government with a perfect opportunity to remedy the financial plight of students and I urge them to take it.&quot;</p>
<p>Nandor noted that last week&#39;s survey by NZUSA illustrated that more and more students were having to work part-, and even full-time jobs just to make ends meet.</p>
<p>&quot;The Prime Minister has signalled that the Government will introduce incentives for people to save for tertiary education. That&#39;s great for those that can afford to save, but not much help for the bulk of students.</p>
<p>&quot;Student debt is a time bomb, and the Government is blithely ignoring the danger it presents. A generation of New Zealanders is growing up with a debt mentality which is affecting study choices, home ownership and birth and migration rates.</p>
<p>&quot;A universal benefit for which students were eligible would be a wonderful first step towards addressing these problems.&quot;</p>
