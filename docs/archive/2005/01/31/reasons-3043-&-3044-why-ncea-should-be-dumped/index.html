<p>Reasons 3,043 &amp; 3,044 why the NCEA should be dumped</p>
<p>Monday 31 Jan 2005<br>Deborah Coddington<br>Press Releases -- Education</p>
<p>Every day more evidence comes in which shows that the Government must move quickly to allow schools to dump the NCEA, ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;One parent wrote to me in the weekend, outlining his concerns, and labelled the qualification &#39;No Chance of Ever Achieving&#39;,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Party has today expressed outrage at a history paper question which stereotyped a National MP as &#39;not sympathetic to Maori concerns&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;National is justified in labelling this brainwashing. However, Dr Brash&#39;s calling for an explanation is not good enough.</p>
<p>&quot;He and Bill English should go further and call for the NCEA to be dumped by those who&#39;ve had a gutsful of this politically correct nonsense.</p>
<p>&quot;Another NCEA horror story that hit my desk this morning was the information that a Year 12 student at an Auckland school got a scholarship in 2004 NCEA Level 4 Geography. This student, however, had &#39;never had a geography lesson in his life except a five-minute chat to the geography teacher the day before..all he had on entering the exam hall was a clutch of coloured pencils&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Never before have New Zealand&#39;s education standards sunk to such a low. It&#39;s time to dump the NCEA and bring back an internationally recognised, objectively measured qualification,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
