<p><strong>Monday, 31 January 2005, 9:31 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Don Brash MP<br>National Party Leader<br>29 January 2005</p>
<p>Brash attacks &#39;deeply troubling&#39; NCEA question</p>
<p>National Party Leader Don Brash is calling for an urgent explanation from Education Minister David Benson-Pope over a &quot;deeply troubling&quot; question in the NCEA history paper.</p>
<p>He is referring to a question which asks students to write from the perspective of &#39;A National Party Member of Parliament not sympathetic to Maori concerns&#39;. The question is accompanied by a caricature of a tall bespectacled man in a suit.</p>
<p>&quot;I am appalled and angry at this and I want some answers from the Minister,&quot; Dr Brash says.</p>
<p>&quot;I want him to explain why this question was written and how it slipped through the checking processes.</p>
<p>&quot;And I want him to make public the NZQA&#39;s model answers to the question.</p>
<p>&quot;This is much too serious for the Minister to fob this on to one of his officials.</p>
<p>&quot;I have absolutely no doubt that most parents would be horrified at the suggestion that their children are being exposed to blatant Labour Party political propaganda in their NCEA exams.</p>
<p>&quot;This is deeply troubling and I think our children need to be protected from it.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very close to brainwashing.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an outrageous abuse of public resources and is totally inappropriate for an agency that must be politically neutral.</p>
<p>&quot;Our kids deserve a lot better than this from our education system,&quot; says Dr Brash.</p>
