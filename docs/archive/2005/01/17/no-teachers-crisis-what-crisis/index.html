<p>No Teachers: Crisis, what crisis?</p>
<p>The teacher shortage crisis is unacceptable and highlights the failure of Labour&#39;s centralised policy for paying for teachers, ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>The MP was responding to reports that up to 350 primary and secondary teaching positions remain unfilled - just two weeks before schools return for the new year.</p>
<p>&quot;Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope denies there is a crisis, despite the fact that many students will be without a teacher come their first day at school,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;Scholarships to fill traditionally hard-to-staff subjects such as mathematics, physics and technology have failed to solve the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s failed education policies make teaching one of the only professions where you have to threaten industrial action to get a pay rise.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT would reward merit and excellence in teaching by allowing schools the freedom to pay good teachers more.</p>
<p>&quot;This would make a real difference in attracting and retaining high-quality teaching professionals,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
