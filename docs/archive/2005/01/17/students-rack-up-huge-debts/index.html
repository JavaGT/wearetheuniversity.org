<p>Students rack up huge debts</p>
<p>The highest loan balance for a single student is $230,810, ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington revealed today.</p>
<p>The MP released new information obtained from Revenue Minister David Cunliffe&#39;s office that shows the five highest student loan balances at September 2004 were: $230,810, $221,054, $221,054, $197,665 and $190,040.</p>
<p>Miss Coddington believes students who have high debts face an almost impossible task of repaying their loans after they graduate.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has failed in its 1999 election promise to curb student debt and it appears unwilling to do anything about the problem. This is a shameful U-turn. As Opposition Tertiary Education spokesman, the recently removed Tertiary Minister Steve Maharey once said:</p>
<p>`I believe debt is reshaping New Zealand as young people defer having a family, put off buying a house, find it difficult to start a business and choose to leave the country&#39;. (Labour media release, 2 October 1999)</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s grizzles in Opposition came when the highest loan balance owed by a single student was $91,500, and the total student debt level was below $3 billion. Today students collectively owe more than $7 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;Such escalation just proves Labour&#39;s hypocrisy. Its modus operandi seems to be: `say one thing in opposition and do another in government&#39;,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
