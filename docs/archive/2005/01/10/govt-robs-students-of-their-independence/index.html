<p>Govt robs students of their independence</p>
<p>Changes to student allowances will see student debt grow and 6,000 more students reliant on their parents for financial support, says National’s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>Previously, students under the age of 25 who had been in the workforce for two or more years, qualified for a student allowance. From this year, their eligibility will be determined by the size of the combined incomes of their parents.</p>
<p>Mr English says this will affect around 6000 students to the tune of an extra $30 million in student loans.</p>
<p>“Students who work to support themselves and pay their way through tertiary study should be encouraged, not punished.</p>
<p>“These students generally have less debt, more idea of what to study and a greater incentive to finish.”</p>
<p>Parental income testing will also apply to some 500 married students under the age of 25.</p>
<p>“It’s ridiculous to think that parents will continue to provide total financial support to their children who have been out of home and in the workforce for two years, let alone their married children,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“The Government has robbed these students of their independence.”</p>
