<p><strong>Friday, 28 January 2005, 4:01 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>New academic leaders for Te Kawa a Mâui</p>
<p>Te Kawa a Mâui, Victoria University&#39;s School of Mâori Studies, has been given a substantial boost with the appointment of a new Head of School and two academic staff with doctorates.</p>
<p>Peter Adds has been appointed as the new Tumuaki of Te Kawa a Mâui, Victoria University&#39;s School of Mâori, Pacific &amp; Samoan Studies.</p>
<p>Mr Adds, who has an MA(Hons) from Auckland University took up his position on January 1. He is also the School&#39;s postgraduate co-ordinator and a member of the Board of Studies for the University&#39;s Development Studies programme.</p>
<p>Mr Adds, who is of Taranaki&#39;s Te Atiawa iwi, is currently completing his PhD on aspects of the tribe&#39;s history. Mr Adds is also researching the portrayal of Mâori and Te Ao Mâori in the broadcasting media as well as Mâori Treaty Settlements and the negotiation process.</p>
<p>As well, Dr Danny Keenan, formerly a Lecturer in Massey University&#39;s School of History, Philosophy &amp; Politics, as been appointed as Associate Professor and Dr Ocean Mercier has been appointed as Lecturer.</p>
<p>Dr Keenan (Te Atiawa) has a BA(Hons) from Victoria and a PhD from Massey University whilst Dr Mercier (Ngâti Porou) has a BSc(Hons) and a PhD from Victoria. Dr Mercier won the Physics Award in the Inaugural Mâori Excellence Awards in 2002.</p>
<p>Pro Vice-Chancellor (Mâori), Professor Piri Sciascia, said the appointments would further boost Victoria&#39;s research and teaching in Mâori Studies.</p>
<p>&quot;Victoria gained the highest average grade nationally in Mâori knowledge and development with the release of the Government&#39;s Performance-Based Research Fund report last year and both the University and School are keen to see that standing further enhanced. The appointment of a new Tumuaki and the addition of two staff with doctorates is a further step in that direction. We&#39;re also actively seeking to appoint a full Professor of Mâori Studies to cement that strong academic leadership in place.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Sciasica also thanked Senior Lecturer Te Ripowai Higgins for her service as Head of School since 2002.</p>
