<p>ACT delivers answer to student debt concerns</p>
<p>Friday 28 Jan 2005</p>
<p>Deborah Coddington - Press Releases - Education</p>
<p>Vote ACT this election to pay off your loan quicker after graduation, was ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington&#39;s message to students today.</p>
<p>The MP was responding to a New Zealand University Students&#39; Association study that shows the average student debt has risen by 36 percent since 2001.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT Leader Rodney Hide in his state of the nation address last week mooted dropping the top tax rate to 25c in the dollar - that would make a huge difference to any graduate trying to repay their loan,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;A graduate earning $40,000 per year could add an extra $35.86 to the minimum student loan repayment. That would pay off the average loan of $14,547 in nearly half the time - four years instead of seven years and 11 months.</p>
<p>Miss Coddington said many graduates were finding it an almost impossible task paying off their loans while also paying Helen Clark&#39;s 39-cent envy tax. &quot;Many will simply leave New Zealand to escape the millstone around their necks,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT wants to make it easier for graduates to pay off their student loans quicker so they can get on with their lives, whether that be to save for a house, have a family or set up a business,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
