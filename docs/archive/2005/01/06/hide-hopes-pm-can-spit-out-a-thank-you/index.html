<p>Hide hopes PM can spit out a &#39;thank you&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;My only hope is that Helen Clark can bring herself to publicly acknowledge the significant and swift United States response to the Asian tsunami,&quot; ACT Leader Rodney Hide said today.</p>
<p>Mr Hide&#39;s comments come ahead of tomorrow&#39;s summit in Jakarta attended by world leaders including American Secretary of State Colin Powell and Florida Governor Jeb Bush.</p>
<p>&quot;The American response to the tsunami has been nothing less than impressive. Over the past 10 days the US has mobilised one of its biggest military disaster relief missions in history, which has included the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier the USS Abraham Lincoln, Seahawk helicopters and cargo planes, delivering badly needed supplies.</p>
<p>&quot;Led by President George W Bush, the United States put aside any relationship strains that might have existed with Indonesia, rolled up its sleeves, and has showed responsible and decisive global leadership.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be nice to think that Helen Clark can put her anti-American views aside for the summit and put on the record her gratitude on behalf of the people of the south-west Pacific.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This horrific disaster is a reminder to a small island nation like ours just how important it is that we strive to rebuild our relationship with the US.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite what the Prime Minister thinks, we might be pleased to see the Americans come to our shores again one day,&quot; said Mr Hide.</p>
