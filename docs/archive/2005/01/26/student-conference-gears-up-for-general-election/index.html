<p>Student conference gears up for general election fight against fees</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is holding its annual January Conference in Wellington over the next three days and top of the agenda is the campaign against student debt in the lead up to this year’s general election.</p>
<p>“This conference is focussed on planning the campaign against the failed policies that are forcing students deep into debt. Student debt is the number one issue for students this election,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association.</p>
<p>“The Government can expect to hear about the disastrous impacts of student debt everywhere they go this year,” said Kirton.</p>
<p>Also on the conference agenda is the launch of the three-yearly TNS Research Student Income and Expenditure Survey, a workshop on how to set up and manage a student food bank and discussions on how tertiary institutions can meet the needs of international students.</p>
<p>“There is little for students to celebrate as they start the academic year, most will be paying higher fees than ever before and over 6000 will find their entitlement to a student allowance cut,” said Jeremy Greenbrook, President of the Victoria University Students’ Association (VUWSA).</p>
<p>“This year, students intend to make it very clear to the Labour Government that higher fees year after year and cuts to allowance eligibility will not win votes from debt laden students or their families, said Greenbrook.</p>
