<p>University Of Auckland Business School Secures Business Education&#39;s Triple Crown</p>
<p>The University of Auckland Business School has passed a significant milestone on its path to world-class status with accreditation awarded by the US-based quality assurance scheme AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business).</p>
<p>&quot;This is a major international acknowledgement of the high quality of our faculty, our students and our business programmes&quot; says Professor Barry Spicer, Dean of The University of Auckland Business School.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re delighted with the accolade. It greatly enhances the international standing of our graduates&#39; degrees and diplomas and also our ability to recruit top calibre researchers and teaching staff from around the world.&quot;</p>
<p>AACSB accreditation gives the Business School the third leg of business education&#39;s coveted &quot;Triple Crown&quot; after being accredited in November by EQUIS, the quality assurance scheme of the European Foundation for Management Development.</p>
<p>The Business School is already a member of the UK-based AMBA (Association of MBAs).</p>
<p>&quot;This achievement reflects well not only on The University of Auckland but the entire New Zealand business education sector,&quot; says Professor Spicer.</p>
<p>Professor Spicer says accreditation follows the Business School&#39;s top ranking among New Zealand business schools in the Government&#39;s Performance-Based Research Fund review of research quality released last year.</p>
