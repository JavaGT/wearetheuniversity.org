<p>Hon Bill English National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>5 January 2005</p>
<p>More polytech courses scrapped</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English, says more polytech courses need to be closely scrutinised, and discontinued if they&#39;re not up to standard.</p>
<p>His comments come as a course at Waiariki Polytechnic faces closure over quality concerns. An investigation into the course was sparked following a number of complaints, including some from students.</p>
<p>Mr English says it takes a lot for a student to pluck up the courage to complain about a course, especially when the complaint is to an institution that has, effectively, endorsed it.</p>
<p>&quot;Most students will just drop out of a course they are unhappy with,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;Waiariki is just the tip of the iceberg in a system bogged down with dodgy deals and low expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;The COOL-IT scam at Christchurch Polytechnic, and other dubious community education courses, have shown that some polytechs will go to great lengths to protect courses that make money for them.</p>
<p>&quot;The Waiariki case is just further evidence that students cannot rely on the system to guarantee the quality of courses.</p>
<p>&quot;Students pay thousands of dollars and give months, and sometimes years, of their lives to these courses. It&#39;s imperative that they have confidence in the system and know that it will provide quality teaching and high educational standards every time,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
