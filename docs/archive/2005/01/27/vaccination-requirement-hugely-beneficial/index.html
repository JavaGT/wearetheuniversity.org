<p>Dr Paul Hutchison National Party Associate Health &amp; Welfare Spokesman</p>

<p>Vaccination requirement hugely beneficial</p>
<p>Requiring people on the DPB to present their pre-school children for vaccinations unless they have a conscientious objection would be hugely beneficial for many children, says National&#39;s Associate Health and Welfare spokesman, Dr Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;The solutions offered by Dr Brash&#39;s Orewa speech are of tremendous importance to give children a fair chance,&quot; says Dr Hutchison, a former obstetrician.</p>
<p>&quot;Kiwi children are thought to have one of the worst rates of immunization completion in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a disgrace that even the Minister of Health, Annette King, cannot answer the question of how many Kiwi children are being fully immunized. The same goes for WellChild checks,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>The next National Government will require those receiving the DPB, Unemployment, Sickness and Invalids&#39; Benefits to present their pre-school children for all appropriate vaccinations and health and dental checks and require their school-age children to attend school regularly.</p>
<p>&quot;After five years of Labour doing nothing, they are starting on a long-awaited immunization register, but in the meantime many thousands of children sustain horrific yet preventable diseases.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is not the children&#39;s fault that they miss out on immunization and health checks,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;Every reasonable step should be taken to ensure that parents on benefits, and all parents, are held responsible.&quot;</p>
