<p>Migrant welfare case highlights need for Brash reforms</p>
<p>Nelson MP Nick Smith cites the case of an unemployed migrant couple as an example of welfare gone wrong.</p>
<p>It was reported on the front page of the Nelson Leader last month that David Gibson, an electrical engineer and former mathematics lecturer in Britain, and his wife, Julia, a special needs teacher, migrated to New Zealand in 1999 and have been on the unemployment benefit since 2001. There are skill shortages in teaching both maths and special needs.</p>
<p>&quot;Here we have a very well qualified couple, who migrated to New Zealand, quite openly drawing an unemployment benefit for three years as though it were a God-given right,&quot; Dr Smith says.</p>
<p>&quot;The attitude is all wrong. This case highlights the need for the sort of reforms advocated by Don Brash.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no question this couple could find work, given their skills. Mr Gibson left a job to develop a mathematical children&#39;s game that does not earn enough to support either him or his wife.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no problem with this couple developing a game that may help children with their maths, but I have a big problem with them expecting other hardworking New Zealanders to pay for it.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Smith says he has had several letters from angry constituents about the case.</p>
<p>&quot;We need the sort of policies Don Brash advocates to make it plain to the Mr and Mrs Gibsons of New Zealand that their first responsibility is to provide for themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;The only exceptional thing about this case is that they are quite public and proud of being on the dole for three years.</p>
<p>&quot;There are thousands of cases like this all over the country where taxpayers are having to fund welfare for people quite capable of supporting themselves under Labour&#39;s soft welfare policies.&quot;</p>
