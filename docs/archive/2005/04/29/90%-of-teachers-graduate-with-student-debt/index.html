<p><strong>Friday, 29 April 2005, 10:19 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>New research shows 90% of teachers graduate with student debt averaging more than $20,000</p>
<p>More than 90 percent of new teachers graduate with a student debt, and their total average indebtedness at graduation is $23,187, according to a new report “Teachers in Debt: A Report Card” released today by the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) and New Zealand Educational Institute (NZEI) Te Riu Roa.</p>
<p>“This research shows that almost all new teachers are now graduating with staggering levels of student debt and are experiencing stress while they teach as a result,” said Colin Tarr, NZEI Te Riu Roa President.</p>
<p>The survey of 841 respondents working as early childhood or primary school teachers in New Zealand found that 70 percent of teachers reported stress because of their student loan and that 48 percent of teacher graduates who leave New Zealand cite their student loan as the main reason why.</p>
<p>“The evidence is very clear: force teachers deep into debt while they train and there will be consequences for our society and our children,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-president of the New Zealand University Students’ Association.</p>
<p>71 percent of respondents reported that their student loan made it difficult to save for the future and 30 percent said that their student debt would influence whether they will have children.</p>
<p>“Teacher education is in crisis, and the government cannot deny that their policy of very high fees and restricted student allowances for teacher trainees is the cause of the problem,” said Kirton.</p>
