<p>AUT Open Day</p>
<p>AUT, New Zealand’s most contemporary and fourth largest University, will open its doors to the public this Saturday (April 9) with an Open Day extravaganza.</p>
<p>Prospective students and their families are invited to come along and explore career and study options, talk to lecturers, graduates and current students, and experience campus life – from attending lectures to enjoying the social and recreational aspects.</p>
<p>There is also the chance to win a $5000 student starter pack.</p>
<p>Budding TV presenters can try out their on-camera communication skills at a mini TV studio, with some expert guidance from AUT staff members and Mâori Television stars Julian Wilcox and Veeshayne Armstrong. The winner gets an iPod Shuffle.</p>
<p>Visitors can get one-on-one advice about courses offered in Applied Humanities, Business, Design and Creative Technologies, Health and Environmental Sciences, Mâori and Pasifika Development and much more.</p>
<p>There’ll be displays, live entertainment, food, stalls and tours at both the Wellesley St and Akoranga (North Shore) campuses, with free shuttle buses between campuses.</p>
<p>Open Day organiser Natalie Jessup says AUT has moved its Open Day to a weekend event as many high school students cannot attend on weekdays because of the NCEA workload.</p>
<p>“It also gives parents and people in the work force the chance to come along and see just how much is available at AUT,” she says.</p>
