<p><strong>Friday, 22 April 2005, 9:49 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National Party Law and Order spokesman<br>22 April 2005</p>
<p>Labour has wrecked confidence in police</p>
<p>National&#39;s Law and Order spokesman, Tony Ryall, says Helen Clark and George Hawkins have wrecked the public&#39;s confidence in the police.</p>
<p>He is commenting on a poll in the National Business Review today that shows confidence in the police has dropped from 71% to 53%.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a vote of no confidence in Labour&#39;s handling of crime.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the public still trusts individual police men and women. The vast majority of police are fine family people doing their best for their neighbours.</p>
<p>&quot;They are doing their best with a government that has the wrong priorities. Quota ticketing and revenue gathering at the expense of emergencies has cut public confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;But we should not be surprised. This Prime Minister and Minister have presided over in just the past year:</p>
<p>· A quota traffic ticketing system that has turned police into revenue gatherers.</p>
<p>· No action on the 111 debacle that has seen people advised to call a taxi, dial 111 and scream, or just walk to the nearest police station.</p>
<p>· Thousands of unallocated cases, including several rape complaints.</p>
<p>· A rising P methamphetamine scourge that is wrecking young lives.</p>
<p>· Police taking two days to attend burglaries, if they get there at all.</p>
<p>&quot;Apart from the emphasis on traffic ticketing - which is simply Labour revenue-gathering policy - these problems stem directly from a lack of resources.</p>

<p>&quot;The 111 system and frontline police are clearly understaffed, as officers themselves, mayors up and down the country, and everyone except Labour knows. Even the crims know police are understaffed by Labour, and welcome it.</p>
<p>&quot;This year&#39;s Budget may include some additional officers - thanks to Don Brash and National. But priorities must change.</p>
<p>&quot;Have no doubt: National will increase police numbers and will change Labour&#39;s insistence on &#39;tax collecting&#39; traffic policing,&quot; Mr Ryall says.</p>
