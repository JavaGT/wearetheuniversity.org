<p>22 April 2005</p>
<p>Green Party List released on Earth Day</p>
<p>The Green Party’s talented team of candidates for this year’s election will attract as many voters as the party’s forward-thinking and practical policies, Green co-leaders Jeanette Fitzsimons and Rod Donald say.</p>
<p>The party has chosen International Earth Day for the release of its top 30 list candidates to reinforce its strong environmental foundations. The returning MPs fill the top eight places.</p>
<p>“There is a huge depth of talent and experience among the new candidates, who have made a strong contribution in their respective fields,” Mr Donald says.</p>
<p>“New Zealand will benefit greatly from them strengthening the Green team, which represents a broad cross-section of constituencies and is well-balanced.</p>
<p>“The completion of the list is one of the final stages the party has to undergo in preparation for the upcoming election, meaning everything is ready for the big day - whenever it is.”</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons says she is very proud to be part of the only party that selects its list using a democratic process involving votes from all members.</p>
<p>The Green Party is only the second party to announce its list and proves that democracy is not a barrier to timeliness, she says.</p>
<p>“The members have expressed confidence in all of the existing MPs and have selected new candidates with a range of expertise in as varied fields as organic farming, treaty issues, environmental toxins and social justice.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to an increased representation in Parliament in order to deliver real progress on environmental and social justice issues for the benefit of all New Zealanders,” she says.</p>
