<p><strong>Friday, 1 April 2005, 4:16 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Student_Choice">Student Choice</a></strong></p>
<p>Compulsory WSU Raises Its Fee By 50%</p>
<p>The compulsory Waikato Students Union (WSU) has raised its fee for 2005 by 50% despite protesting against an increase in tuition fees last year, Student Choice said today.</p>
<p>Every fulltime Waikato University has to pay $75 plus gst a year to WSU, up from $50 in 2004, costing Waikato students over $900,000 this year. The decision to raise the compulsory WSU fee was made at a meeting in late 2004 and was voted on by a handful of students. The fee increase was then approved by the university council and was collected by the university administration at enrolment and passed to the association.</p>
<p>Student Choice spokesman Glenn Peoples said the fee increase was more pure hypocrisy from student politicians. In October last year WSU opposed a 3.5% increase in tuition fees, and at the time WSU president Sandy Pushpamangalam said &quot;the decision to raise student fees was short-sighted and fails to take into account the terrible consequences of more student debt&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Pushpamangalam doesn&#39;t think students should pay 3.5% more for their education but is quite happy for them to pay 50% more to fund student politics, and has no qualms about adding to student debt in the process,&quot; Glenn Peoples said.</p>
<p>The increase in the compulsory WSU levy comes on top of a $60,000 loss for Orientation in 2002-03. Sources on the WSU executive indicated that the fee increase was necessary to fund a serious shortfall in WSU&#39;s accounts.</p>
<p>Mr Peoples said someone on the Waikato University Council needs to ask some hard questions about WSU&#39;s financial situation and stop rubber-stamping such excessive fee increases.</p>
