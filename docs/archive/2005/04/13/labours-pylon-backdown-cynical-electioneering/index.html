<p>Labour&#39;s pylon backdown cynical electioneering</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s cynical attempt to appease angry voters over its unpopular pylon plan is all about electioneering, ACT Energy spokesman Ken Shirley said today.</p>
<p>The MP was responding to Energy Minister Trevor Mallard&#39;s announcement that the Electricity Commission will investigate alternative methods of supplying Auckland&#39;s future electricity needs.</p>
<p>&quot;The state-owned monopoly has been studying national grid options for 10 years and all of a sudden the Government is telling it to go back to square one and start again.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government&#39;s duplicity has further changed by the fact that they&#39;ve introduced to parliament special legislation specifically aimed at fast-tracking the pylon project through RMA procedures. Can we now assume that this leglisation will be withdrawn?</p>
<p>&quot;The pylon debate has been a huge embarrassment for Labour, which is desperate to sweep it under the carpet before it becomes an election issue.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark&#39;s sole focus is to win a historic third term - that is Labour&#39;s Holy Grail. We&#39;ve seen her already this week backdown and back peddle on John Tamihere, and now doing all she can to warm up Waikato farmers.</p>
<p>&quot;The bad news for the Prime Minister is that landowners against power lines will simply see this latest announcement for what it is: pure and cynical electioneering,&quot; Mr Shirley said.  </p>
