<p>Former PM to discuss New Zealand’s relationship with Asia</p>
<p>Former New Zealand Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Jim Bolger, whose administration pursued an outward-looking foreign policy especially in the Asia/Pacific region, will deliver a presentation on New Zealand’s relationship with Asia in Auckland next week.</p>
<p>The leader of the National Party for almost 12 years, Mr Bolger will be in Auckland as a guest of The University of Auckland’s New Zealand Asia Institute, and will talk about “New Zealand and Asia: Future Possibilities” at a business breakfast at the Northern Club on April 18.</p>
<p>In his three consecutive terms as head of Government, Mr Bolger represented New Zealand at five Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders&#39; summits and chaired the Commonwealth Heads of Government (CHOGM) meeting in New Zealand in 1995.</p>
<p>In December 1997 Mr Bolger retired as Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, and was appointed Minister of State and Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade (with special responsibility for APEC). He was New Zealand Ambassador to Washington from 1998 to 2001 and is currently the Chairman of the Boards of both New Zealand Post and Kiwi Bank.</p>
