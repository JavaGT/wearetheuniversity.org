<p>Young Labour gets ready for campaign</p>
<p>Young Labour, the youth wing of the Labour party, met recently at the Wellington congress to select a new national executive and plan its election year strategy and activities.</p>
<p>“The Labour party has a good story to tell to the youth of New Zealand” said Conor Roberts, the new President of Young Labour.</p>
<p>“Young people we talk to relate to our policies well, like how we kept New Zealand out of the Iraq war, how we have supported New Zealand music and the arts, how we have increased access to student allowances, increased the youth minimum wage and how we have passed socially progressive pieces of legislation like the Civil Union Act.</p>
<p>“For the youth of New Zealand, its really important that a Labour led government is re-elected so young people aren’t sidelined again and forgotten like they where in the 1990’s.</p>
<p>“I mean Don Brash’s National party hasn’t even bothered appointing a youth affairs spokesperson.”</p>
<p>Young Labour has grown steadily over the years with many young people attending last years nation-wide ‘Clarion Tour’ (see <a href="http://www.clariontour.co.nz">http://www.clariontour.co.nz</a>) and our annual summer school. It also has many youth candidates standing for the Labour party in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>“The people in the youth sector are really keen to get out and get involved in the election and we look forward to helping re-elect a Labour government. Our greatest challenge is getting young people to vote.</p>
<p>“With only just over half doing so at the last election, we will be getting out there with our message and showing them that politics does matter.”</p>
<p>“I also think its important that young people get involved in the party. I’ll be telling them that if they want to get political they should join any party, but if they want to make a difference they should join Labour”</p>
