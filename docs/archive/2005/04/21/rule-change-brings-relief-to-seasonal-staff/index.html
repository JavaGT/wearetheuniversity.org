<p>Rule Change Brings Relief to Seasonal Staff</p>
<p>Changes to stand-down rules for the unemployment benefit will bring a huge relief to thousands of seasonal workers, Council of Trade Unions secretary Carol Beaumont said today.</p>
<p>From May 1, benefit applicants will be able to choose an income assessment period of 26 or 52 weeks for the assessment of the initial stand-down. Currently they have to have it assessed only over the last six months of work.</p>
<p>“This has meant that that some seasonal workers have faced a stand-down of two or three months because they had a high income for a short time,” Carol Beaumont said. “The rules did not recognise that this was their income for the entire year.”</p>
<p>Unions pressed for the change and it would be welcomed by seasonal workers, she said.</p>
<p>“Industries need these valuable workers and this rule change will help to ensure a skilled and reliable workforce is available,” Carol Beaumont said.</p>
