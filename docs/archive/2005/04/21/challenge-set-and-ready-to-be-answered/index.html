<p>Challenge set and ready to be answered</p>
<p>The mighty AuSM/AUT Titans are first time hosts of University Games, the biggest tertiary sporting event in New Zealand, and are ready to claim the shield they deserved to win last year.</p>
<p>AUT won most major sporting events last year and were robbed by paper champions Otago, a team more than double the size of the Titans. The narrow loss made the AUT team more determined than ever to clean up on home turf.</p>
<p>The quality of athletes are second to none says Paul Stewart, student president of the Auckland Student Movement @ AUT (AuSM).</p>
<p>“The Titans are the finest athletes in New Zealand. After stringent trials, a super squad of disciplined and talented athletes have been selected to represent us. We already have a reputation for excellence in all significant sports and have evolved, over the past year, into a team with strengths in alternative events as well – including climbing, fencing and table tennis.”</p>
<p>Stewart says the team has grown since last year’s controversy and is determined to ensure there is no mistake at this year’s awards ceremony.</p>
<p>“We&#39;re ready for all who come to challenge our formidable team. The Titans will be the most dominant, dynamic and driven team University Games has ever seen.” The opening ceremony of the 2005 University Games will be held at AUT&#39;s North Shore Campus on Sunday, April 24 with competition commencing Monday afternoon. Students and the public are welcome to watch the Titans put the rest of NZ&#39;s universities to shame.</p>
