<p><strong>Thursday, 21 April 2005, 2:56 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Don Brash<br>National Party Leader</p>

<p>Brash backs DIY builders</p>
<p>National Party Leader Don Brash today announced that National will repeal provisions in Labour&#39;s new building legislation that stop New Zealanders from carrying out DIY renovations on their own homes.</p>
<p>The Building Act 2004 will require that all significant building work must be carried out or supervised by a licensed building practitioner. When the owner of a building obtains a building consent, they must notify the local council of the building practitioner who will supervise or do the work.a</p>
<p>&quot;This is unnecessary red tape which strikes at the heart of Kiwi ingenuity and self-reliance. Generations of New Zealanders have built and renovated their homes to get ahead in life,&quot; says Dr Brash.</p>
<p>He made the announcement at the home of Lynda Forscutt, a sole parent building her own home with the help of Habitat for Humanity.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no evidence that the leaky home problem was caused by DIY builders. The Government&#39;s claim in Parliament that DIY building work is &#39;shonky&#39; is a gross generalisation and an insult to the thousands of Kiwis who have built and renovated their homes,&quot; says Dr Brash.</p>
<p>&quot;Under National, DIY builders will still be required to get a building consent and have their work certified as complying with the building code, as was the case prior to the implementation of the Building Act.</p>
<p>&quot;National believes in independence and home ownership. We want people to have the freedom to build and improve their own homes without being bogged down by bureaucracy.&quot;</p>
