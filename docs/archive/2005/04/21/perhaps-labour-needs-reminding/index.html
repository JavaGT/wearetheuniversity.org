<p>Judith Collins MP National Party Families Spokeswoman</p>
<p>21 April 2005</p>
<p>Perhaps Labour needs reminding</p>
<p>National Party Families spokeswoman Judith Collins has released a series of quotes in a bid to &quot;remind the Labour Government what they used to say about golden handshakes.&quot;</p>
<p>She is commenting on the secret pay-out given to Families Commission chief executive Claire Austin, who worked at the commission for only three months.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m not prepared to wait until the annual report. Why can&#39;t Steve Maharey come clean with the public now?</p>
<p>&quot;If Helen Clark was consistent she would be calling for Rajen Prasad&#39;s head, especially given her comments on the settlement with former TVNZ newsreader John Hawkesby,&quot; says Ms Collins.</p>
<p>Helen Clark on golden handshakes</p>
<p>On the Hawkesby payout at TVNZ &quot; I think the buck stops at the top. Mrs Meo has resigned,&quot; Helen Clark The Press 17 February 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;The public was septic about golden handshakes as am I,&quot; - Helen Clark Nelson Mail Oct 06, 2001.</p>
<p>On the out of court settlement with John Yelash where details were kept secret &quot;the confidentiality clauses drawn up by Miss Clark&#39;s lawyers are so tight that the parties cannot even confirm the existence of a settlement,&quot; - The Dominion 11 May 2001.</p>
<p>&quot;In principle we don&#39;t like golden handshakes,&quot;- Helen Clark The Dominion August 08, 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;Where are all these golden handshakes under Labour? I&#39;m not aware of it. Whenever such matters have come to our attention they have been stopped.&quot;- Helen Clark July 2000.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;re trying to stamp on it but of course we&#39;re stuck with the fact that another Government was in for nine years with very sloppy procedures,&quot; - Helen Clark The Dominion July 2000.</p>
<p>Miss Clark said her Government was going to &quot;abandon the culture of golden handshakes, negotiated in secrecy and paying people for doing nothing,&quot; - Helen Clark Waikato Times Feb 09, 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;The objection was to people going under conditions of secrecy, with no openness about it, and going with large amounts of money for doing nothing,&quot; - Helen Clark SST Jan 30, 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;The party is over. The nonsense is going to stop,&quot; - The Dominion, 22 Nov 1999.</p>
