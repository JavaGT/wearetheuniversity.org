<p>Sloth bigger threat than gluttony claims leading activity researcher</p>
<p>A leading New Zealand physical activity researcher believes inactivity could be contributing more to the obesity epidemic facing the country’s youth than was first thought.</p>
<p>Dr Grant Schofield, a Senior Lecturer in the New Zealand Institute of Sport and Recreation Studies, which is based at AUT’s Akoranga campus on Auckland’s North Shore, co-authored an article in the latest edition of the journal Youth Studies Australia. The publication was dedicated to “Youth sport, physical activity and leisure in Australia and New Zealand.”</p>
<p>While currently much attention is paid to poor nutrition as a cause of obesity in adolescents, Dr Schofield says a decline in the activity levels of youth should not be ignored.</p>
<p>“A growing body of research indicates that low activity rather than overeating may be a significant basis of the obesity problem.</p>
<p>“Much of Auckland’s rush hour traffic congestion is caused by parents driving their children to school. Fifteen years ago most children would walk to school,” says Dr Schofield.</p>
<p>He says that in order for Government to formulate appropriate policy to counter the problem, more in-depth research needs to be conducted.</p>
<p>“The data to make any definitive conclusions and empirically informed policy directions is conspicuous by its absence.”</p>
<p>Dr Schofield says while there have been several studies into the health of young New Zealanders, little cross-sectional population data are available in any New Zealand age group simultaneously examining body fatness, dietary habits, and physical activity.</p>

<p>“Much of the physical activity data that does exist has not been collected using well-validated and reliable measures.</p>
<p>“As a national research priority New Zealand must establish a regular national public health surveillance programme concurrently measuring youth nutrition, physical activity, and body composition that accounts for the ethnic diversity in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in the population is a serious problem with profound long-term repercussions for the New Zealand health system.</p>
<p>“Conservative estimates are that obesity costs New Zealand at least $135 million annually. This does not include downstream costs associated with lifestyle diseases. Type II diabetes alone costs more than $280 million a year.”</p>
