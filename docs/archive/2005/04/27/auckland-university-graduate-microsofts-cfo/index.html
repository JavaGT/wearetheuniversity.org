<p>Auckland University graduate to lead Microsoft’s global finance organisation</p>
<p>Computer software giant Microsoft Corporation has appointed University of Auckland engineering graduate Chris Liddell to lead its global finance organisation.</p>
<p>A civil engineering graduate from the University’s Faculty of Engineering, Mr Liddell takes up the new post of chief financial officer (CFO) on May 9.</p>
<p>As CFO, Mr Liddell will have responsibility for accounting and reporting, strategic planning and analysis, treasury, tax, audit, and investor relations.</p>
<p>Dean of Engineering Professor Peter Brothers says the University is delighted with Mr Liddell’s appointment.</p>
<p>“We are proud of Chris’ achievement and wish him the very best. His success demonstrates the ability of engineers to transcend the boundaries of their discipline and take on leading roles in the world of business.</p>
<p>“An engineering degree prepares students for understanding real-world situations and solving complex problems. The critical thinking ability of engineers is recognised in strategic positions in business throughout the world,” says Professor Brothers.</p>
<p>Mr Liddell is currently chief financial officer at International Paper, a Fortune 100 company, and the world’s largest forest products company. Before that, he was chief executive officer of one of New Zealand’s largest companies, Carter Holt Harvey.</p>
<p>In addition to an engineering degree from The University of Auckland, Mr Liddell holds a master of philosophy degree from Oxford University.</p>
