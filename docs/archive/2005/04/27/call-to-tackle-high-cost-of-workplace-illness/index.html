<p>MEDIA RELEASE<br>27 April 2005</p>
<p>Call to Tackle High Cost of Workplace Illness</p>
<p>Employers must take responsibility to tackle the hidden hazards that leave<br>thousands of workers suffering from occupational disease, Council of Trade<br>Unions president Ross Wilson said today.</p>
<p>Workers around the country will mark international Workers’ Memorial Day<br>tomorrow, remembering those who lost their lives while at work or who died<br>as a result of workplace injury or disease.</p>
<p>The report of the National Occupational Health and Safety Advisory Committee<br>estimated 700 -1,000 deaths each year from occupational disease,<br>particularly cancer, respiratory disease and heart disease.</p>
<p>Around 17,000 to 20,000 new cases of work-related disease are also reported<br>each year.</p>
<p>“This represents a huge cost to workers’ health, to employers in lost<br>productivity, and to the community,” Ross Wilson said. “The report<br>estimates the total cost over a year of work-related disease and injury is<br>between $4.3 billion and $8.7 billion.</p>
<p>“The cost of having a safe and healthy workplace is nothing compared to the<br>cost - in terms of both money and health - of allowing workers to become<br>sick, injured or killed on the job.”</p>
<p>Workplaces must get heath and safety systems in place which involve workers,<br>as is required under the law, he said.</p>
<p>“The involvement and commitment of workers and management is the key to<br>overcoming our dismal statistics of occupational disease,” Ross Wilson said.</p>
