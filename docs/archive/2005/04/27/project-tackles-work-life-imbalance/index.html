<p>MEDIA RELEASE<br>27 April 2005</p>
<p>Project Tackles Work-Life Imbalance</p>
<p>The Government’s decision to fund work-life balance projects in several workplaces will help to develop practical solutions to work-life problems affecting thousands of workers, Council of Trade Unions secretary Carol Beaumont said today.</p>
<p>The Government has committed $1.8 million over three years in a number of workplaces to identify issues affecting work-life balance, develop tools to tackle the problems and evaluate the changes.</p>
<p>“Unions see work-life balance as being about the fundamental aspects of decent work - such as fair pay, secure employment, reasonable hours of work and access to quality, affordable childcare,” Carol Beaumont said.</p>
<p>Unions, workers and employers will be working together to address work-life balance issues under the plan announced today.</p>
<p>“The CTU is a partner in the Government’s work-life balance project and we expect that this latest initiative will benefit both employers seeking to attract and retain a skilled workforce and workers who are trying to balance their work with their family and other responsibilities.”</p>
