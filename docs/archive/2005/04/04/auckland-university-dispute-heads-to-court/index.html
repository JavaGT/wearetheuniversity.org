<p><strong>Monday, 4 April 2005, 3:54 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Association_of_University_Staff">Association of University Staff</a></strong></p>
<p>The Employment Relations Authority has referred a dispute between the Association of University Staff (AUS) and the University of Auckland to the Employment Court after mediation last week failed to resolve the issues between the parties.</p>
<p>The AUS commenced legal action against the University of Auckland’s Vice-Chancellor, Stuart McCutcheon, after he refused to meet with unions and other university employers for preliminary national employment agreement negotiation discussions. Stuart McCutcheon told the AUS he will only negotiate single-employer collective agreements at his University, meanwhile he is giving non-union staff a 4.5 percent salary increase.</p>
<p>In legal proceedings, the AUS has alleged that the Vice-Chancellor’s refusal to participate in multi-employer is in breach of the obligations set out in the Employment Relations Act to:<br>• Use his best endeavours to enter into an arrangement with the AUS, the other unions representing university staff and the other six university employers to set out a process for bargaining.<br>• Meet with the unions for the purposes of bargaining.<br>• Consider and respond to proposals made by the unions.<br>• Be active and constructive in maintaining a productive employment relationship with the other university employers.</p>
<p>The AUS has also alleged that the Vice-Chancellor has undermined the bargaining process by:<br>• Contravening the Employment Relations Act by communicating directly with union members about bargaining.<br>• Placing pressure on the AUS not to participate in or pursue multi-employer bargaining.<br>• Undermining the authority of the AUS in bargaining.</p>

<p>AUS also says that the Vice-Chancellor is discriminating against union members by giving non-union staff a 4.5 percent salary increase, whereas union members will not receive a salary increase unless they abandon multi-employer bargaining and participate in single-employer bargaining.</p>
<p>The AUS is seeking:<br>• An order requiring the Vice-Chancellor to participate in the multi-employer bargaining.<br>• A declaration that the Vice-Chancellor has acted unlawfully by refusing to participate in multi-employer bargaining.<br>• A declaration that the Vice-Chancellor has unlawfully undermined the bargaining by refusing to bargain, and by making an offer to increase the salaries of non-union staff.</p>
<p>AUS has sought an urgent hearing in the Employment Court, and is now awaiting a hearing date.</p>
<p>AUS National President Professor Nigel Haworth said that the unions had initiated bargaining earlier in the year for new national collective employment agreements as part of a campaign to address inadequate funding and salaries in the university sector. “Union members have endorsed a 30 percent salary increase for academic staff and 16 percent plus a national job evaluation scheme for general (non-academic) staff, all to be implemented over a three year period,” he said. “The AUS is committed to building a strong alliance across all parties in the university sector in support of adequate salary levels.”</p>
<p>The AUS and other university unions represent around 60 percent of the University’s core staff.</p>
