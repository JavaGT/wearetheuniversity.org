<p>Nandor aims to win Auckland Central Party Vote</p>
<p>The Greens will be aiming to win the Party Vote in Auckland Central, says third-time candidate Nandor Tanczos.</p>
<p>With some 15.7 per cent of the vote, the Greens polled second in the Party Vote in the electorate in the 2002 General Election.</p>
<p>“There is enormous support for the Greens in Auckland Central, so we’ll be aiming to turn that into an outright win in the Party Vote,” said Nandor.</p>
<p>“We are not trying to win the Electorate Vote, because winning the Party Vote is the best way to increase the number of Green MPs. The more Greens there are in Parliament, the more effective we can be at delivering the Green vision, and targeting the Party Vote is the best way for us to achieve that goal with the resources we have.</p>
<p>“But I will be campaigning hard to make it clear why Green policies are relevant and needed in Auckland Central. The Greens are the only party that has real sustainable solutions on the issues of transport and urban development, which are central in Central. In particular, I have a number of creative ideas for addressing Auckland’s traffic congestion that I’m looking forward to outlining during the campaign.”</p>
<p>Nandor was recently selected unopposed as the Green candidate for Auckland Central for the 2005 General Election. He is has been a List MP since 1999 and is the Green Party’s Spokesperson on Justice, Corrections, Drug Law Reform, IT, Treaty and Constitutional Issues, Tertiary Education and Youth Issues.</p>
