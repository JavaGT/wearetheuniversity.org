<p><strong>Monday, 4 April 2005, 9:22 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Taxpayers Pay for Sex Operations</p>
<p>A new government policy to fund sex change operations has got Rakaia MP Brian Connell hopping mad. ‘I feel deeply aggrieved and angry on behalf of the many constituents who contact my office with genuine health needs who can’t afford knee hip or dental operations and who are feeling absolutely desperate. And now the government is funding sex-change operations to the value of $30,000. This not PC gone mad, it’s PC off the planet’ said Mr Connell.</p>
<p>‘What is happening to New Zealand that has allowed us to get our priorities so wrong?’ he asked. ‘If people want to change their sex that’s their business, but why are taxpayers paying for it? That’s our business!’</p>
<p>Mr Connell also described the establishment of Canterbury’s first charity hospital as an indictment of the Labour Government’s performance in the health arena, and says that the hospital will be picking up the slack left by a hospital service in disarray. Initially it will be confined to day surgery and will be treating people with conditions that are not acute who cannot afford healthcare.</p>
<p>‘The thought that the Government would deny vital surgery to someone who needs treatment for cataracts, but happily fund a sex-change operation, at much greater expense from the public purse, is utterly abhorrent,’ said Mr Connell.  </p>
