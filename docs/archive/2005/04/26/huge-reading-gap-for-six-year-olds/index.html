<p>Huge reading gap for six-year-olds</p>
<p>National’s Education spokesman, Bill English, says a Ministry of Education report shows only about half of New Zealand’s lower decile primary schools use the Government’s flagship Reading Recovery programme.</p>
<p>“This means the children who most need help with reading aren&#39;t getting it,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>The Reading Recovery programme is aimed at six-year-olds with reading difficulties.</p>
<p>“If only half of low decile schools use the Reading Recovery programme, then thousands of six-year-olds are missing their last chance to be caught in the safety net,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>National announced last week that it will provide reading and maths vouchers to the value of $700 to any child who does not meet national standards by the age of seven.</p>
<p>Mr English says National’s reading vouchers will fill the gap for children who are missing out on the help they need.</p>
<p>“Reading recovery is a safety net for children who are struggling, but half of this country’s lower decile schools, for whatever reason, are not making use of it.”</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education says low decile schools are less likely to have reading recovery programmes, despite the fact they get more funds and are perceived to have greater needs.</p>
<p>“This leaves a huge hole and helps explain why New Zealand has one of the biggest disparities in reading in the developed world,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“Critics of National’s reading voucher need to explain why it’s okay for children in 680 primary schools to go without.”</p>
