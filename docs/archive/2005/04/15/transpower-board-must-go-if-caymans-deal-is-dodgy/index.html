<p>Transpower Board must go if Caymans deal is dodgy</p>
<p>Transpower&#39;s board should be fired if their Cayman Islands tax deal proves to be as dodgy as it looks, says Green Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>The state-owned electricity grid operator is reportedly trying to reduce its tax bill by leasing the South Island power network in a shadowy deal that ultimately leads to the Caymans.</p>
<p>&quot;If Transpower have engaged in dodgy dealings that have cost the taxpayer or put the grid at risk, its board and CEO must be fired immediately,&quot; said Ms Fitzsimons, a persistent critic of Transpower over its Waikato transmission lines plan.</p>
<p>&quot;So the Government must quickly investigate this deal and report back on its impact on electricity consumers and taxpayers. Michael Cullen needs to put the facts before the people.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders expect their SOEs, especially one running something as essential as the electricity grid, to conduct itself in a transparent and ethical manner. On the evidence we can see this morning, this all looks very reminiscent of the BNZ&#39;s adventures in the 1980s.</p>
<p>&quot;If in fact everything is above board and ethical, New Zealanders need to know the facts that establish this, quickly,&quot; said Ms Fitzsimons.</p>
