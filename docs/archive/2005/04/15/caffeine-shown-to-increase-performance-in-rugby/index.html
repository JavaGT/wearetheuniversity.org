<p>Caffeine shown to increase performance in rugby players</p>
<p>A new study into the effects of caffeine on rugby players suggests it can significantly enhance performance in several ways.</p>
<p>The study was performed by Gene Stuart, a research student at the Auckland University of Technology and was supervised by AUT’s Professor Will Hopkins.</p>
<p>Professor Hopkins says the findings are important because there have been no previous studies of the effects of caffeine on the way athletes perform in team sports.</p>
<p>“Several studies have shown that caffeine enhances performance of single bouts of endurance exercise such as long distance running, but its effects on repeated bouts typical of those in high-intensity team sports are unclear.</p>
<p>“This study showed benefits for athletes including sprinting speed, fatigue reduction and up to a 10 per cent improvement in passing accuracy. These results are quite remarkable and show there are significant performance advantages across the board,” he says.</p>
<p>The study involved eight competitive male rugby players ingesting either caffeine or a placebo 70 minutes before performing a rugby simulation test. Each test consisted of seven circuits during two 40-minute halves with a 10-minute half-time break.</p>
<p>Each circuit included measurements of sprint time (two straight-line and three agility sprints), power generation in two consecutive drives, and accuracy of passing balls rapidly.</p>
<p>AUT research associate Christian Cook, who was one of the study’s co-authors and member of HortResearch’s Human Performance Group, observed that caffeine increased the release of testosterone in the subjects during the performance test.</p>
<p>Professor Hopkins says that this could have repercussions for athletic training. “Future studies may well show that caffeine has an anabolic when combined with training,” he says.</p>
<p>Professor Hopkins says that while most people get a daily hit of caffeine through drinking coffee, its consumption did not have the same positive effect on physical performance.</p>
<p>“There is something in coffee that reduces the performance-enhancing effects of the caffeine it contains.”</p>
