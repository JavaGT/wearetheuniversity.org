<p>Union Members Back Work-Life Bill</p>
<p>The Green’s Bill for flexible working hours would make a huge difference in the work-life balance of thousands of workers with young families, Council of Trade Unions secretary Carol Beaumont said today.</p>
<p>The Employment Relations (Flexible Working Hours) Amendment Bill passed through its first reading in Parliament last night and has been referred to select committee.</p>
<p>It would give employees with young children the right to request reduced, part-time or flexible hours.</p>
<p>Many union members say that the pressure to balance work with family life is a major problem, Carol Beaumont said.</p>
<p>“We know the problem and we know that flexible working hours are part of the solution, but this needs backing in the law to make it happen for thousands of workers.</p>
<p>“Unions support the Greens’ bid to change workplace culture so it respects the needs of parents with young children to work hours that suit family life,” Carol Beaumont said.</p>
