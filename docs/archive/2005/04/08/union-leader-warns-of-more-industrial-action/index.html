<p>Union Leader Warns of More Industrial Action</p>
<p>Employers who resist fair claims for better wages and working conditions by their workers can expect industrial action, Council of Trade Unions president Ross Wilson warned today.</p>
<p>“The current action by university staff, bank workers, bus drivers, hospital workers, furniture and manufacturing workers and metal workers is the result of out of touch employers misjudging the determination of their own staff,” he said.</p>
<p>“The campaign by the union movement has given workers the confidence to claim their fair share, and they have the full support of the CTU.”</p>
<p>With chief executive salaries up 5.2 per cent, and the minimum wage up 5.3 per cent, there was a strong case for a minimum 5 per cent pay rise for all workers, Ross Wilson said.</p>
<p>“New Zealand workers are tired of waiting for their employers and are exercising their legal rights to get a fair pay deal,” he said. “There is no doubt that there will be further industrial action unless some employers get real.</p>
<p>“Workers are finding that there is strength in numbers, and that it pays to join a union.”</p>
