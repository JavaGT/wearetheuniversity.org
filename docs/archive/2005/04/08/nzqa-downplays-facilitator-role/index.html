<p>NZQA downplays facilitator role</p>
<p>NZQA’s attempts to downplay the role of assessment facilitators in the setting of NCEA exams are disingenuous, says National’s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>Mr English has released information that shows NZQA exams are overseen by people who may know nothing about the subject.</p>
<p>“NZQA have confirmed that assessment facilitators do not have specialist subject expertise and have attempted to downplay the significance of their role,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>But according to official NZQA documents National Assessment Facilitators are responsible for the following tasks:</p>
<p>Training all exam writers</p>
<p>Attending meetings with examiners and material developers to plan examinations and confirm assessment specifications</p>
<p>Checking and critiquing exam material in the subject they are responsible for</p>
<p>Considering and actioning all reports from independent checkers and ensuring that all their comments have been addressed</p>
<p>Approving the final exam paper</p>
<p>“The fact that the same facilitator is responsible for biology and economics, and another is responsible for agriculture and art history is simply alarming.</p>
<p>“NZQA owes New Zealand students and teachers a better explanation than they have offered so far,” says Mr English.</p>
