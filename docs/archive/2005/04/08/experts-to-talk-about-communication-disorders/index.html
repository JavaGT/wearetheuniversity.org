<p>Experts gather to talk about communication disorders</p>
<p>The occupational hazards for people whose voice is their major tool of trade, the use of communication disorders as a roadmap to disease diagnosis and technological advances in hearing aids are some of the issues on the agenda for an international conference at the University of Canterbury.</p>
<p>The two-day Canterbury Conference on Communication Disorders, which opened today, has attracted several hundred delegates from six countries.</p>
<p>Keynote speakers include Professor Ivan Barofsky, who spent 10 years at the Swallowing Centre at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, USA.</p>
<p>As resident psychologist he worked with psychogenic dysphagia patients and counselled them as they dealt with major changes in their capacity to swallow.</p>
<p>His presentation to the conference tomorrow will discuss health-related quality of life issues facing people with dysphagia.</p>
<p>Professor Barofsky will also discuss difficulties assessing the health-related quality of life of what he refers to as compromised patients, such as stroke victims, who have limited communication abilities.</p>
<p>UC’s Department of Communication Disorders, which is hosting the conference, is the longest running speech-language therapy programme in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is responsible for educating the vast majority of communication disorder professionals in New Zealand and has recently introduced a training programme for audiologists.</p>
