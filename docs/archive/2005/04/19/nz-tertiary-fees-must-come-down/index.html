<p>New international study confirms: NZ tertiary fees must come down</p>
<p>Students are today demanding an immediate end to high fees and restricted access to student allowances after New Zealand ranked a shameful 15th out of the 16 countries assessed in the Educational Policy Institute’s Global Higher Education Ranking Study on the affordability of tertiary education.</p>
<p>“This study proves what students, graduates and their families have known for years; tertiary education in New Zealand is completely unaffordable,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-president of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>The comparative study ranks tertiary education in New Zealand as less affordable than in Australia, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p>
<p>“This study is a major embarrassment to Trevor Mallard and the current Labour-led Government who promised to keep tertiary education affordable when they were elected in 1999. This research confirms that they have failed,” said Camilla Belich, Co-president of the NZUSA.</p>
<p>Students are calling on the government to stop blindly defending the current system and immediately lower fees to improve affordability for New Zealand students.</p>
