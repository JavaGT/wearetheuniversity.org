<p>Workers on Board for Profit and Productivity</p>
<p>Involving workers and their unions in an industry can make it more competitive, productive and profitable, according to a new study.</p>
<p>The study The Food and Beverage Sector: A Trade Union Perspective was carried out by researchers at the Centre for Labour and Trade Union Studies at the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>“The research confirms that high performance workplaces need to involve all stakeholders – including workers and their unions,” said Council of Trade Unions secretary Carol Beaumont. “You can’t have a smart enterprise without worker engagement.”</p>
<p>Carol Beaumont is a member of the recently established Food and Beverage Taskforce.</p>
<p>The report says that worker involvement, through their unions, adds social and economic value in terms of industry best-practice, supporting industry strategies, and improving productivity.</p>
<p>“Unions are pushing for worker involvement in industries to help to build a high value, high skill, high quality economy which values its workforce and can compete in the global market,” Carol Beaumont said.</p>
