<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>19 April 2005</p>
<p>Poor-paying Employers Rich in Excuses</p>
<p>Council of Trade Unions president Ross Wilson is outraged at the idea that workers should miss out on a pay rise because of the high value of the New Zealand dollar.</p>
<p>He said the Canterbury Employers Chamber of Commerce was looking for excuses when it said that export firms were struggling so couldn&#39;t afford to pay their workers a fair share.</p>
<p>&quot;How many more excuses are employers going to come up with?&quot; he said. &quot;Our workers have no control over foreign currency fluctuations but at the end of the day they&#39;re expected to carry the can.”</p>
<p>Some employers kept raising the bar of excuses for not giving pay rises.</p>
<p>“First they say they’re not making enough, then profits rise so they say productivity is still too low to justify pay rises. And now they are blaming the exchange rate.”</p>
<p>Ross Wilson said he could not remember employers being generous when the NZ dollar was low. “We&#39;d all be blue in the face if we waited for exporters to pass on their extra profits when the Kiwi dollar is low.&quot;</p>
