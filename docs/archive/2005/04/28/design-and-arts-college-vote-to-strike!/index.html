<p>Design and Arts College vote to strike!</p>
<p>“Union members at the Design and Arts College in Christchurch are extremely disappointed at the refusal of the employer (Susan Mc Allister) to make a reasonable offer in the current employment negotiations and strike action is planned”, Lloyd Woods said today.</p>
<p>Woods, the National President of ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa (the professional association and union that covers staff across the tertiary sector including Private Training Establishments) added “our members have had a unanimous vote for strike action and this seems inevitable unless Ms McAllister recognises what is needed for a fair deal. She is offering a 2% salary increase and has refused to negotiate what is a very reasonable redundancy clause. 2% is simply unacceptable and would mean the real salaries of our members would fall further behind the cost of living and their colleagues elsewhere in the sector. It is particularly irritating to note that the difference between the union members’ last position and the employer’s offer would cost the College less than $10,000 in total for union members. This is despite the fact that teaching staff have increased their productivity”</p>
<p>Mr Woods went on to say “members at Design and Arts College are just like staff at other educational institutions. They do not like taking strike action because they do not like affecting student learning, but just as with other employees around the country, they know they have the right to a fair go and they are prepared to fight for it”.</p>
