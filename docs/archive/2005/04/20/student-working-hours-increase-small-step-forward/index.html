<p><strong>Wednesday, 20 April 2005, 9:35 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Increase in international student working hours a small step forward</p>
<p>Students are today labelling the changes to the number of hours international students can work while studying (from 15 to 20 hours) as a small step towards addressing the needs of these students while they study in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“International students will be pleased that the amount of time they can work per week has gone up to a more realistic level of 20 hours,” said Camilla Belich, Co-president of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>“We have been fighting for this change for sometime and it is good to see that the Government has finally listened,” said Belich.</p>
<p>International students often face substantial increase in fees while they are studying in New Zealand, meaning many are forced into financial hardship and poverty.</p>
<p>“These changes will be meaningless for international students unless the Government also introduces a policy of ‘grand-parenting’ of international student fees immediately,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-president of NZUSA.</p>
