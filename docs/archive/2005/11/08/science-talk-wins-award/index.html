<p>Science Talk Wins Award</p>
<p>Dr Alison Campbell and Dr Penelope Cooke love to talk science. The University of Waikato biological sciences lecturer and earth sciences post-doctoral fellow have just been awarded the New Zealand Association of Scientists&#39; (NZAS) Science Communicator Award for 2005.</p>
<p>The Science Communicator Award is presented to practising scientists for excellence in communicating to the general public in any area of science or technology.</p>
<p>With a mutual passion for science education and a reputation for &#39;just getting on with it&#39;, Dr Campbell and Dr Cooke have dedicated themselves to making science accessible to the public.</p>
<p>They are the driving force behind the renowned Evolution for Teaching website, launched in March 2004 to provide expert support and quality material for New Zealand&#39;s science teachers. The site specifically focuses on evolution and related geological concepts from a New Zealand perspective, with New Zealand examples and links to the New Zealand senior school curriculum.</p>
<p>They are also the founders of the Hamilton branch of the hugely popular Café Scientifique, a science forum held in a local cafe where people are able to ask questions and debate issues over a coffee or cold beer. The concept has spread locally and there are now meetings in Tauranga and Auckland. The Hamilton Café Scientifique recently held a party to celebrate the Earth&#39;s birthday, complete with dinosaur cake.</p>
<p>&quot;Many people have a poor understanding of the nature of science, yet must live in a world where science and technology are increasingly important in their everyday life,&quot; says Dr Campbell. &quot;With Café Scientifique we aim to provide people with an informative and entertaining evening of science, in a relaxing setting.&quot;</p>

<p>When she&#39;s not teaching, researching, maintaining the evolution website, or co-ordinating café meetings, Dr Campbell can regularly be found giving science talks in high schools round the upper North Island.</p>
<p>Dr Cooke says that understanding science needs to be a life-long activity. &quot;Many topics in science are recent developments that will not necessarily have been covered in school science in the past.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Campbell and Dr Cooke will be presented with the Science Communicator Award at a ceremony on Wednesday 23 November. The Evolution for Teaching website can be found at: <a href="http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/evolution/index/shtml">http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/evolution/index/shtml</a></p>
