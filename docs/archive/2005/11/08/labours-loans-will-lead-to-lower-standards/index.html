<p>Hon Bill English National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>8 November 2005</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s loans will lead to lower standards</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English, says Labour&#39;s student loan scheme will result in increased student debt and lower quality education.</p>
<p>The legislation providing for interest-free loans was tabled in Parliament today.</p>
<p>Mr English says the policy encourages more students to borrow more money and pay it back more slowly.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently just 55% of students eligible for a loan take one out. But now the more than 100,000 students who are eligible for a loan but haven&#39;t yet taken one out have a strong incentive to take out a full student loan and put it in the bank to earn a nice little nest egg on the taxpayer.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if only half of those students take up the opportunity, the total student debt burden will grow by an additional $2 billion over the next three years.</p>
<p>&quot;Universities and polytechs are already pushing their fees up as they struggle to meet staff demands for competitive pay. If these institutions can&#39;t pay market rates they will lose key staff and the quality of education offered will decline.</p>
<p>&quot;Families will also pay through lower quality education. The billions spent on the interest-free loan policy will draw money away from polytechs, university staff and facilities. It does nothing to help the 20% of children who struggle with basic reading and maths.</p>
<p>&quot;Even an interest-free education is worthless if its quality is low,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
