<p>National congratulates Sir Kenneth Keith</p>
<p>National MPs Richard Worth, Chris Finlayson and Wayne Mapp are congratulating Sir Kenneth Keith on his election to the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p>Sir Kenneth, who retires from the Supreme Court Bench in a few weeks, was elected on the 6th round. He is the first New Zealander to become a judge on the International Court, based in The Hague.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Kenneth Keith has provided outstanding service to New Zealand for many years&quot;, says Chris Finlayson, National&#39;s shadow Attorney-General.</p>
<p>&quot;I have very fond memories of Sir Kenneth as a teacher in the law school of Victoria University where he was Professor of Law and Dean for many years.&quot;</p>
<p>After leaving Victoria&#39;s law school, Sir Kenneth became Deputy President, then President of the Law Commission, and joined the Court of Appeal in 1996. After the new Supreme Court was created, he joined the Supreme Court Bench.</p>
<p>Dr Worth says: &quot;In all his positions, Sir Kenneth has served with distinction. He was always a thoughtful, courteous and pleasant judge.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dr Wayne Mapp who taught International Law at the University of Auckland, said Sir Kenneth is one of the world&#39;s pre-eminent international lawyers. &quot;I particularly appreciated his role as my PhD supervisor. Sir Kenneth&#39;s knowledge was truly encyclopaedic.&quot;</p>
<p>The National Party congratulates Sir Kenneth on his elevation, thanks him for all he has done for New Zealand, and wishes him all the very best in The Hague.</p>
