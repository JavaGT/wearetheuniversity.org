<p><strong>Tuesday, 8 November 2005, 1:59 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>John Key MP National Party Finance Spokesman</p>
<p>08 November 2005</p>
<p>Labour confirms $2 billion hit from loans plan</p>
<p>National Party Finance spokesman John Key says Labour has finally confirmed that its student loans policy will cost a lot more than it originally suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;Papers released today confirm National&#39;s fear that this extravagant, vote-buying policy will wipe $2 billion off New Zealand&#39;s net worth.</p>
<p>&quot;Even now the Government has failed to recognise the ongoing impact this scheme will have on New Zealand&#39;s balance sheet.</p>
<p>&quot;The Auditor General has already confirmed that to me in a letter.</p>
<p>&quot;The $2 billion write-down is only part of the total cost of this reckless policy. On top of that, the taxpayer is threatened by a massive blow-out going forward, as students feast on a diet of growing debt.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Key says he is looking forward to the full Treasury costings of the student loan policy now that legislation has been tabled.</p>
<p>&quot;Then we&#39;ll get to see just how expensive and irresponsible this election promise was.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s clear Helen Clark, Michael Cullen and Trevor Mallard never wanted the initial costings made public before the election. But nothing they&#39;ve said since convinces me that Treasury got it wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, the IRD annual report shows the number of students taking out loans increased in the past year, even before Labour announced plans to make student loans interest free.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a reckless policy that will encourage students to borrow the maximum and repay only the minimum,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
