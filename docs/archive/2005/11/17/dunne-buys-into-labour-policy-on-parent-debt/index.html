<p>Dunne buys into Labour policy on parent debt</p>
<p>National Party Welfare spokeswoman Judith Collins says she is disappointed Revenue Minister Peter Dunne plans to proceed with the “anything but commonsense policy” to write off half a billion dollars in liable parent debt.</p>
<p>“This Clark/Peters Government just can’t stop giving away taxpayers’ money.<br>Around $2 billion will transfer to students from workers through the loans bribe, and now half a billion will transfer to liable parents who aren’t taking responsibility for their kids.</p>
<p>“I had hoped that Mr Dunne, as Minister of Revenue, might bring a commonsense approach to the issue of unpaid child support, which has now passed the $1 billion mark and is reaching record levels.</p>
<p>“Writing off debt sends the worst possible message to absent liable parents. The Government is telling them that if they dodge their responsibilities for long enough they will get a discount. That is the wrong message to send.</p>
<p>“Those who do the right thing and pay their way will be left wondering why they bothered. Our vulnerable children deserve better than a child support collection system that rewards debt dodgers.</p>
<p>“Hiding debt by writing it off is not the answer.”</p>
<p>Ms Collins is urging Peter Dunne to review the whole area of child support payments.</p>
<p>“Too many Kiwi parents are still escaping to Australia to avoid their obligations here, despite the reciprocal agreement we have with our nearest neighbour,” says Ms Collins.</p>
