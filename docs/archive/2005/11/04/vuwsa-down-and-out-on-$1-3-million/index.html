<p>VUWSA down and out on $1.3 million<br>3 November 2005</p>
<p>Despite putting out the begging bowl to cover costs of its recent Salient legal action, Victoria University Students Association (VUWSA) is a very wealthy incorporated society which this year took over $1.3 million in compulsory fees from Victoria University students, Student Choice said today.</p>
<p>In 2006 VUWSA will receive another $1.3m in compulsory levies from Victoria students. Every Victoria student must pay money to the association before they can study.</p>
<p>VUWSA&#39;s latest accounts (2004) show the association had a surplus of $296,171, assets of $808,975, and equity of $665,300. In 2004 VUWSA had nett fee income of $1,279,603.</p>
<p>Student Choice spokesman Glenn Peoples said VUWSA&#39;s strong financial position means it doesn&#39;t need donations. &quot;The association could easily apply for a short term loan based on its equity or the guaranteed $1.3m it will receive early next year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Peoples said it was ironic that VUWSA was appealing for voluntary donations. If VUWSA is confident it provides students with value for money, it could extend its new-found donation principle and ask individual students if they would voluntarily pay the VUWSA levy.</p>
<p>Student Choice supports voluntary membership of student associations on the grounds of freedom of association.</p>
