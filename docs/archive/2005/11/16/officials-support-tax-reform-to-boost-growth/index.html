<p>John Key MP<br>National Party Finance Spokesman</p>

<p>Officials support tax reform to boost growth</p>
<p>National Party Finance spokesman John Key says Treasury briefing papers released late today prove &quot;how out of touch and out of date Labour really is&quot;.</p>
<p>The Treasury notes that economic studies &#39;have made significant advances in recent years .... these studies strongly suggest that high marginal tax rates damage growth&#39;.</p>
<p>The Treasury goes further and says &#39;new studies have shown that taxes on personal income, company income, payroll and property damage growth, while taxes on goods and services have a more muted effect on growth ... these studies suggest that high marginal tax rates on personal and company income are the most damaging to growth&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Treasury expresses urgency in having the Government focus on tax reform - by which they mean lowering marginal rates - &#39;in the shortest possible time frame&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;These papers show that Labour&#39;s old-fashioned ideological opposition to meaningful tax reform is holding our economy back. The crucial factor in a meaningful growth strategy is missing and that is bad news for working New Zealanders. &quot;Treasury has also endorsed National&#39;s concerns about a productivity collapse in the public sector, and highlighted concerns about profligate and wasteful government spending.</p>
<p>&quot;The quality of health and tertiary education spending is of particular concern to Treasury officials, who are urging the Government to pay special attention to these areas,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
