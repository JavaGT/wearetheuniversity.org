<p>Media Release<br>Books and Boots: A.H. Reed Biography Published</p>
<p>Author Ian Dougherty was eight years old when he first met Alfred Hamish Reed in 1961. Reed was 85, and nearing the end of his famous walk from North Cape to Bluff. Wearing a three-piece suit and collar and tie, and carrying a battered suitcase, he stopped for a chat with a group of excited school children waiting to see him on his journey. Dougherty was among them.</p>
<p>During his lifetime A.H. Reed became one of the most recognised, respected and influential figures in New Zealand. Remembered by many as an eccentric folk hero for his long-distance walks throughout the country, he was also a pioneering publisher, prolific author and selfless benefactor.</p>
<p>Thirty years after his death, a long overdue biography of Alf Reed has just been published: Books and Boots: The story of New Zealand publisher, writer and long-distance walker, Alfred Hamish Reed. Dougherty, an historian and journalist, looks at Reed&#39;s life and also provides a more critical analysis of his work as a publisher and writer.</p>
<p>Leaving school at the age of 12, Reed transcended his working roots in the Northland gumfields to found the publishing firm A.H &amp; A.W. Reed. He and his wife Belle were devout Christians and the firm&#39;s first publications were for Sunday Schools.</p>
<p>But Reed was also a shrewd businessman and, with his nephew Clif (A.W.) Reed, published a growing range of books on New Zealand&#39;s landscape and lifestyle. After his official retirement in 1940, he wrote prodigiously, including books about his long-distance walks and New Zealand history. Dougherty makes public for the first time correspondence between Reed and historians and editors about his publishing and writing - correspondence that is very critical of Reed giving &#39;a naively charitable and simplistic version of New Zealand history&#39;.</p>
<p>Reed gave away almost all that he owned and earned. He devoted significant time and funds to building up a collection of rare manuscripts and books at the Dunedin Public Library, which included manuscript and printed bibles and autograph letters. The Alfred and Isabel and Marian Reed Trust was established in 1939. Among its activities, the Trust assisted various philanthropic organisations, published or subsidised the publication of dozens of religious and secular books and booklets, and donated money to a kauri park in Northland.</p>
<p>Dougherty&#39;s biography offers an engaging portrait of Alf Reed, his beloved Belle, his ceaseless activity and his many contributions to the wider community.</p>
