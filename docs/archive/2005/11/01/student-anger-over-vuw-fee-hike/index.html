<p>Student anger over VUW fee hike</p>
<p>Students at Victoria University are today condemning a move by the university council to increase student fees for 2006 by up to 10%.</p>
<p>&quot;Students present at the council meeting today were clearly angry at the decision to increase fees. Not doubt many more will be angry when they return next year to find their fees have increased dramatically while they have been away,&quot; said Nick Kelly, Vice-President of the Victoria University Students&#39; Association (VUWSA).</p>
<p>&quot;The university has posted surpluses for the last 3 years and has under-predicted student enrolments for the coming year. Victoria is not a tertiary institution in a bad financial situation so the 5-10% fee increases are completely irresponsible and unacceptable,&quot; said Kelly.</p>
<p>The council fee setting meeting was held away from the traditional location in the Hunter Building in Kelburn to the more remote Karori campus. Despite this around 50 students turned up during their exam period to voice their concern at the increases.</p>
<p>&quot;In this years general election Labour promised to write off interest for student loans. It appears that while the government promises to give with one hand, its taking with the other by allowing tertiary institutions to increase student fees&quot; said Kelly</p>
<p>&quot;The number of students accessing the VUWSA foodbank increased by 33% this year after a 4.5% increase in fees, the 5-10% fee increased passed today is also likely to increase hardship for Victoria students,&quot; said Kelly.</p>
<p>The Victoria University Council today voted for a 5% across the board fee increase and will apply to the Tertiary Education Commission for an additional 5% increase for Humanities and Social Science students.</p>
<p>The Victoria University Education Action Group and VUWSA are organising a march on Parliament for Thursday March the 9th, which is the second week of term 1 classes in 2006.</p>
