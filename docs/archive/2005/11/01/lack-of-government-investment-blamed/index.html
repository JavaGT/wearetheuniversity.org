<p><strong>Tuesday, 1 November 2005, 10:24 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>

<p>Lack of Government investment blamed for Victoria fee increases</p>
<p>Victoria University undergraduate student fees will rise by 5% in most cases in 2006.</p>
<p>If an application to the Tertiary Education Commission is successful, students enrolled in humanities or education courses will face a further 5% increase in July 2006.</p>
<p>Chancellor, Emeritus Professor Tim Beaglehole, said that the University Council took the decision to increase fees with great reluctance.</p>
<p>“It was necessary to look to the longer term future of Victoria University against an ever- increasing demand for quality and a decline in the number of students enrolling. Clearly we are unable to maintain or improve our standing as a leading research-led university without increasing investment in library resources and staffing.</p>
<p>“Student fees are one of the few sources of revenue we are able to control. This decision was unavoidable because Government has failed to maintain its level of investment per student and is not keeping pace with inflation. The University Council had to ensure it has the resources to maintain the quality of Victoria’s programmes.”</p>
<p>Professor Beaglehole said that, for the first time since 2003, Council was able to set domestic tuition fees with members of the public present.</p>
<p>“Despite at times rowdy protests, I was pleased to welcome students to the meeting and hope to include them in future governance processes.”</p>
