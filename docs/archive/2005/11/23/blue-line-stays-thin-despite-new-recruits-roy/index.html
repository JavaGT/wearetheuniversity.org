<p>Blue Line Stays Thin, Despite New Recruits - Roy</p>
<p>Heather Roy<br>Wednesday, 23 November 2005<br>Press Releases - Crime &amp; Justice</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s admission that their &quot;thousand extra police&quot; may not see the front line is a blow to anyone who thought the government was finally getting serious about crime, says ACT National Security Spokesman, Heather Roy.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand First have been duped over their confidence and supply agreement. It&#39;s clear from Ron Mark&#39;s supplementary question in the House last week that New Zealand First MPs believed their unusual confidence and supply arrangement with Labour had secured a thousand new front line police officers.</p>
<p>&quot;Today in Parliament, Annette King explained that there is no guarantee the thousand new police will operate anywhere near the front lines.</p>
<p>&quot;Hard working but overstretched police must be gutted to find out they may not receive the assistance that everyone thought they were promised,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s going to be difficult for Labour to deliver even this watered down coalition promise.</p>
<p>&quot;The attrition rate for sworn police was 4.7%, and the attrition rate for non-worn staff was 12%, in the year to October 2005.</p>
<p>&quot;To add a thousand extra staff over the next three budgets, the Police will actually have to recruit and train two thousand people.</p>
<p>&quot;The new Minister of Police needs to get cracking on recruiting new officers, and should come clean to New Zealanders about just what Labour intends to do to fill the critical gaps in our police force,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
