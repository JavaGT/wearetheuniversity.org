<p>Long Arm of the Law in Community Hands</p>
<p>Heather Roy<br>Wednesday, 9 November 2005<br>Press Releases - Crime &amp; Justice</p>
<p>A grandmother who retrieved her property after finding the person who burgled her should be congratulated instead of scolded, says ACT Police Spokesman, Heather Roy.</p>
<p>&quot;Citizens have a right to protect themselves, their families and their property. Local communities also have a role to play in ensuring their own safety and security,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Police are doing their best, but are impeded by poor resourcing. The Government must act swiftly to rectify this, and provide safety and security for Kiwis.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Robert Peel, the founder of modern policing, recorded the principle that the police do not have special powers, but simply do full-time what any law-abiding citizen has the right and responsibility to do part- time.</p>
<p>&quot;We should be defending - not discouraging - people who look after themselves and their neighbours.</p>
<p>&quot;Many recent cases have highlighted the Police&#39;s inability to act, even when given the names and addresses of alleged offenders. Is it hardly surprising that communities are now organising themselves to fight off criminals.</p>
<p>&quot;The new Ministers for Police and Justice should have three critical priorities - to speed up the thousand extra police officers, significantly increase police resources and endorse ACT&#39;s Supplementary Order Paper to the Arms Act (Amendment) Bill, which would protect people who defend themselves,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
