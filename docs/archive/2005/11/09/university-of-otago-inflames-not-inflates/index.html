<p>University of Otago Inflames, not Inflates</p>
<p>Domestic tuition fees will rise by up to 12.7% in 2006 for some students at the University of Otago as a result of today’s University Council fee setting meeting. Most Otago students will face across the board increases of 5% in 2006 as the University increased fees to the maximum allowed under the fee maxima and annual fee movement limit scheme.</p>
<p>“The move to increase fees is most disappointing” said Otago University Students’ Association president Steven Sutton. Student representatives on the University Council put up an alternative suggestion to amend fees for 2006 by inflation. “However, the Council rejected this commonsense suggestion and instead decided to increase fees as much as possible for 2006” said Mr Sutton.</p>
<p>“The University of Otago faces a tight financial situation in 2006. Students should not be treated as a stop gap to fill the gaps left by under-funding of universities.”</p>
<p>“Increases in quality at Otago must come through greater government investment, not from annual fee hikes. We were left with one positive and unified outcome from today’s meeting, an agreement for the Students’ Association, University and Dunedin City Council to jointly lobby the government for better investment in university education” concluded Mr Sutton.</p>
