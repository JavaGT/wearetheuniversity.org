<p>The University of Auckland&#39;s Formula SAE team competing in the Te Onpu Hill Climb event in Hawkes Bay as part of their warm up for theAustralasian Formula SAE Competition in Melbourne.</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>Formula 1 has the world&#39;s fastest racing cars, built with cutting edge technology and multi million dollar budgets. A team of engineering students from The University of Auckland is using some of the same technology but without the million dollar budget.</p>
<p>The Faculty of Engineering&#39;s Formula SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) team is one of only a handful of motorsport teams outside of Formula 1 to have a rolling floor wind tunnel.</p>
<p>Entered in the Australasian Formula SAE competition the team, who are New Zealand&#39;s only University to enter, have to design, construct and race a prototype race car, costing no more than $50,000 Australian dollars.</p>
<p>Up against 30 of the world&#39;s top engineering universities in Melbourne at the start of December the team is using the testing technology to help give them the edge over their competition.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an amazing piece of equipment that Glidepath have kindly given to us and it will hopefully give us a significant advantage over the other teams,&quot; says Chief Engineer Matt Houston.</p>

<p>The team have already started testing a half scale model of their car on the 1.5m wide high speed conveyor belt in the University&#39;s twisted flow wind tunnel.</p>
<p>&quot;The modified conveyor belt can travel at up to 50km per hour so we can use it to give us a better idea of what the wind is doing to the car as it moves,&quot; says Matt.</p>
<p>The testing will allow the team to improve the down force of the car, making it take corners at a faster speed.</p>
<p>Entering the competition for the first time last year the team finished 6th and picked up the best endeavour award for rookie of the year.</p>
<p>With last year&#39;s experience in the bank and other technology advances the team is aiming for first this season.</p>
<p>&quot;We have made some other major advances with the car including the chassis. We&#39;ve replaced the steel frame and constructed a carbon fibre monocoque chassis making the car a lot lighter and stiffer.&quot;</p>
<p>After the race in Melbourne the team hopes to compete in the USA and UK Formula SAE competitions in 2006.</p>
