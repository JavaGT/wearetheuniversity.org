<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>30 November 2005</p>
<p>Governor-General visits Victoria’s Vietnam campus</p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington’s growing links with Vietnam will be further recognised when New Zealand Governor-General, the Hon Dame Silvia Cartwright, today unveils a plaque at its campus in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
<p>Pro Vice-Chancellor (International), Professor Neil Quigley, says unveiling the plaque celebrates the twinning programme between Victoria and Vietnam’s University of Economics and recognises the strength of the relationship between the two universities.</p>
<p>“Several years ago, Victoria embarked upon a strategy of developing relationships with high-quality universities in the Asia-Pacific region. One of those relationships has been with University of Economics and we’re delighted that Dame Silvia has been able to unveil the plaque at our facilities at its Ho Chi Minh Campus.”</p>
<p>Also in attendance will be officials from Vietnam’s University of Economics and New Zealand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs &amp; Trade while Victoria’s Pro Vice-Chancellor (Maori), Professor Piri Sciascia, and Te Ripowai Higgins, the Taurima of Victoria’s Te Herenga Waka Marae, will welcome guests on to the campus with a Māori karanga and karakia.</p>
<p>The relationship between the two universities has been developing over several years. In 2001, two universities signed a twinning agreement that allowed Victoria’s first-year Bachelor of Commerce &amp; Administration courses to be taught at the University of Economics. Students who successfully completed the courses could then move to Wellington to complete their degrees at Victoria.</p>
<p>In 2004, the successful co-operation between these two universities moved to a new level. An agreement was reached that allowed Victoria to use the University of Economics facilities in Ho Chi Minh City. Victoria has refurbished two floors of a building on the campus with technology.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the twinning arrangement entered a new phase with the addition of Victoria&#39;s Foundation Studies programme to the courses taught in Ho Chi Minh City. As a further development, the students taking the courses in Ho Chi Minh City are now fully enrolled Victoria students taught by staff either seconded from Wellington or contracted from within the University of Economics. It is expected that the range of subjects offered will increase and allow students to work towards other Victoria degrees.</p>
