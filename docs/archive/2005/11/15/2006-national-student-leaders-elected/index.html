<p>2006 National Student Leaders Elected</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) has elected Conor Roberts, current Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA) Administrative Vice-President, and former National Affairs Officer as the second Co-president of NZUSA for 2006.</p>
<p>“I am really excited about representing the interests of students to the Government next year, said Conor Roberts, Co-president elect of NZUSA.</p>
<p>“I am committed to ensuring the introduction of the interest free student loan policy goes smoothly and lobbying to increase access to student allowances,” said Roberts.</p>
<p>Conor will join Joey Randall as NZUSA Co-president in 2006 and Jennifer Jones as NZUSA National Women’s Rights Officer who were both elected in October this year.</p>
<p>Joey was previously AUSA Education Vice-President in 2004 and Jennifer is the current Education and Welfare Vice-president at Victoria University Students’ Association (VUWSA).</p>
<p>“Jenn, Conor and I are really thrilled to be taking on the leadership of NZUSA and we look forward to furthering the goals of students at a national level,” said Joey Randall, NZUSA Co-president elect.</p>
<p>“Well over 50 percent of students are women, however women graduates face longer repayment times than the general population. I look forward to improving the situation for women students in 2006,” said Jennifer Jones, National Women’s Rights Officer elect.</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national body for students and has been representing students since 1929. Current Co-presidents Camilla Belich and Andrew Kirton, and National Women’s Rights Officer Karen Price, will continue in their roles until the end of this year.</p>
