<p><strong>Tuesday, 15 November 2005, 9:43 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology">Auckland University of Technology</a></strong></p>
<p>AUT signs deal with prestigious Chinese research partner</p>
<p>Finance academic Dr Hang (Robin) Luo is the first recipient of a Visiting Research Fellowship under a new partnership between China’s Nanjing University and AUT University.</p>
<p>Nanjing University’s Business School and AUT’s Faculty of Business award fellowships on a competitive basis and will exchange academic staff on joint research activities.</p>
<p>Dr Luo will take up his 12-week fellowship in late 2006 and research the topic: Are Chinese investors reluctant to realise their losses?</p>
<p>“My research will illustrate that investors have a tendency to realise their gains too soon and hold on to losers too long,” he says. “It investigates Chinese investor characteristics and stock attributes that may connect to the disposition effect.”</p>
<p>Dr Luo says AUT’s partnership with one of the most prestigious universities in China will strengthen the academic collaboration between the two institutions. He says his research will complement the existing literature of behavioural finance.</p>
<p>&quot;It recognises that stock and investor characteristics do have an impact. It connects the cultural differences in beliefs of mean reversion to differences in the disposition effect between Chinese and foreign investors.”</p>
<p>Dr Luo says AUT has a profound commitment to this research in the Asia-Pacific region and the new partnership recognises that.</p>
<p>Nanjing Business School Dean, Professor Shuming Zhao completed formalities with a visit to AUT this week. A Visiting Fellow from Nanjing will arrive at AUT University during July 2006.</p>

<p>Associate Dean of Research for AUT’s Faculty of Business Professor Thomas Lange is the driving force behind the unique partnership.</p>
<p>“This is a wonderful opportunity for our researchers to work collaboratively with some of China’s leading business scholars,” he says. “Our agreement has its crowning moment with Professor Zhao’s visit to AUT.”</p>
<p>Professor Zhao is known internationally and serves on a number of editorial boards of international peer reviewed journals, including International Journal of Cross Cultural Management. Last week, he was keynote speaker at an international research conference in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Nanjing University is ranked third in China from nearly 800 universities. It consistently sits in the top five of around 1,200 business schools in China. The university has 10 schools: Humanities, Law, International Business, Foreign Studies, Natural Sciences, Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Technology, Geoscience, Life Sciences and Medicine.</p>
<p>During his Fellowship, Dr Luo will also present seminars at Wuhan University and Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, where he holds an Adjunct Research Fellowship and an Adjunct Professorship, respectively.</p>
