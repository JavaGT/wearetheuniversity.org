<p>&#39;Passing of Vine Deloria - an intellectual beacon amongst indigenous people&#39; says Tariana Turia, Co-lealder, Maori Party</p>
<p>&quot;The passing of Vine Deloria, Jr. a prominent Native American scholar, whose research, writings, and teaching have encompassed history, law, religious studies, and political science is indeed a sad occasion for the international indigenous community,&quot; said Tariana Turia co-leader of the Maori Party, on the death yesterday of a favourite son of the Standing Rock Sioux.</p>
<p>Hailed by Time magazine as &quot;one of the eleven great religious thinkers of the twentieth century&quot;, Vine Deloria a retired Professor Emeritus of history at the University of Colorado and the author of many highly praised books, including Red Earth, White Lies, and God is Red &quot;shone as an intellectual beacon amongst indigenous people&quot;. said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;While I never met Dr. Deloria&quot; said Mrs Turia, &quot;I have always been inspired by his keen intellect and his absolute commitment to articulating the world view of his people which as a result inspired other indigenous scholars and activists, including tangata whenua here in Aotearoa&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Having often used his thoughts in my speeches over the years, my thoughts are with his family at this time&quot;.</p>
<p>Na reira, e te rangatira Vine, takahia te ara a o matua tipuna. Waihotia ko matau kei muri e takatu nei.</p>
