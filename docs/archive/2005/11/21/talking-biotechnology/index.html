<p>Talking Biotechnology</p>
<p>Biotechnology is fundamentally changing our lives – the food we eat, the clothes we wear, our approach to illness and even the way we bring our children into the world.</p>
<p>International experts and groups involved with the key issues of biotechnology will spend four days exploring how advances in biotechnology are impacting on society at a conference to be launched by the Minister of Research, Science &amp; Technology, the Hon Steve Maharey, on Tuesday 29 November.</p>
<p>Talking Biotechnology, organised by Victoria University, will run from 29 November to 2 December at Pipitea Campus. The event seeks to explore how the dialogue surrounding biotechnology has evolved and how that evolution has impacted, or might impact, upon society.</p>
<p>Twelve keynote speakers and more than 50 other experts will discuss topics as varied as ‘mothers and biotechnology’, ‘the Christian community in New Zealand enters the biotech debate’, ‘commercialisation of biotechnology in India’ and ‘responsible journalism in the biotech debate’.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Sally Davenport, conference co-convenor, says the event will be of great interest to all those involved in the ‘social’ aspects of science and technology, including policy makers, regulators, educators, business people and media, as well as biotechnologists and academic researchers.</p>
<p>“The global biotechnology field is rapidly growing and changing as new biotechnologies with wide-ranging and innovative applications are developed. Public debate must keep up with so this conference provides an exciting and important forum which will enable productive and inspiring ‘biotechnology talk&#39;.</p>
