<p>HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE TREATY OF WAITANGI</p>
<p>In New Zealand we have a Bill of Rights and a Human Rights Act, precluding discrimination in both public and private sectors.</p>
<p>New Zealand also has the Treaty of Waitangi. The Treaty is one of our principal founding documents. It is now routinely regarded as the framework for relations between the Crown and Maori, both for matters of process and for expected outcomes.</p>
<p>* to what extent does that relationship impact on Asian communities?</p>
<p>* How do the Treaty and the modern human rights move- ment relate to each other?</p>
<p>* Can a Goverment maintain and act upon a Treaty with one part of the citizenry appearing to enjoy different rights to other parts?</p>
<p>* Is there room for the Treaty within the human rights frame- work?</p>
<p>* What does all this mean in the fields of health, education, justice, delivery of social services, local government, and employment?</p>
<p>* How does all this impact on the public and private sector, especially for Asian communities?</p>
