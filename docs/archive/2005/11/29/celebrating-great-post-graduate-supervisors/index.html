<p>Celebrating great post-graduate supervisors</p>
<p>The Otago University Students’ Association is pleased to announce the ten winners of a 2005 OUSA Supervisor Awards. “These annual awards, started in 2003, allow post-graduate students to acknowledge and thank those research supervisors who go beyond the call of duty” said OUSA President, Steven Sutton.</p>
<p>“The high standard and large number of nominations for this year’s awards show that Otago’s excellence in research extends beyond academics’ personal interests” said Mr Sutton. “Many supervisors dedicate considerable effort to developing and encouraging their post-graduate students and OUSA is proud and pleased to recognise this. Quality supervision is a vital component in Otago producing world-class research” he concluded.</p>
<p>From a total of 140 supervisors across the University, this year’s winners are:</p>
<p>Dr Ian Appleton Pharmacology and Toxicology<br>Dr Mike Boyes Physical Education<br>Dr Vicky Cameron Medicine (Christchurch)<br>Dr Gill Johnson Physiotherapy<br>Dr Patricia Langhorne Physics<br>Prof Rob Lawson Marketing<br>Dr Andrew McGregor Geography<br>Dr David Orlovich Botany<br>Dr Richard Walter Anthropology<br>Dr Gary Wilson Geology</p>
<p>From these ten, the 2005 OUSA Supervisor of this Year is chosen, to be announced at an awards ceremony on this Friday. This year’s overall winner is Dr Mike Boyes. One of Dr Boyes’ research students said: “The trust he has given me as a young academic is awesome…treating me like a colleague…Mike is also the most humble person I know or know of, excepting perhaps the Dalai Lama…who would be richer for a PhD journey with Mike as a supervisor.”</p>
<p>The 2005 OUSA Supervisor of the Year Awards will be presented at a ceremony in the Gazebo Lounge, University Union Building, at 5pm on Friday 25 November 2005.</p>
