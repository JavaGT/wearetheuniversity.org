<p>Public get the mushroom treatment on NCEA</p>
<p>National’s Education spokesman, Bill English, says Labour is hiding ministerial briefing papers that paint a very negative picture of the NCEA and NZQA.</p>
<p>“The briefing written by the NZQA for the incoming minister has been leaked to some in the media but Steve Maharey has not released it publicly.</p>
<p>“In a bizarre interview this morning Minister Steve Maharey said he had asked journalists not to publicise the briefing because it might upset students sitting exams.</p>
<p>“Media reports so far suggest the briefing lifts the lid on poor morale in NZQA and low public confidence in NCEA.</p>
<p>“This is an astonishing U-turn by NZQA who have always maintained that the NCEA is flawless and that its critics are stupid.</p>
<p>“Steve Maharey must release the briefing papers now. The public have every right to know whether his Government believes in its own national qualification, and every right to worry when a minister tries to keep them in the dark,” says Mr English.</p>
