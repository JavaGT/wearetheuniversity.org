<p><strong>Friday, 11 November 2005, 11:03 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>John Key MP National Party Finance Spokesman</p>
<p>11 November 2005</p>
<p>Cullen must clear mortgage confusion</p>
<p>National Party Finance spokesman John Key says Michael Cullen should move quickly to reject the suggestion that he&#39;s planning to intervene in the economy with measures that will drive up the cost of buying a home or servicing a mortgage.</p>
<p>&quot;The Finance Minister was quick to rule out a capital gains tax on rental property, yet the issues being talked about today are far more serious and have the potential to do far more damage to our economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Silence at this time is not an option.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Cullen was the master of understatement when he earlier said the options he&#39;d asked the Reserve Bank and the Treasury to consider weren&#39;t &#39;exactly attractive&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;The options, made public by the Reserve Bank yesterday, amount to economic sabotage.</p>
<p>&quot;Small business survives off the back of the housing market. The wrong call could cripple small business and send finance companies to the wall.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#39;s playing Russian Roulette with a fully loaded gun,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
<p>The measures under consideration have been widely criticised by economists, the Consumers Institute, academics and property investors.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government should be looking at getting its own house in order before it looks to decimate the value of everybody else&#39;s.</p>
<p>&quot;Just this week, Dr Cullen confirmed that the Government, which has been on a six year spending binge, has no plan to trim spending.</p>
<p>&quot;But rather than ask Ministers to be more disciplined in their spending, Dr Cullen is looking to punish homeowners.</p>
<p>&quot;The UK and Australia are emerging from similar cycles without Government-ordered intervention,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
