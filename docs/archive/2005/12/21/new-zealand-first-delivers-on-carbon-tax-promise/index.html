<p>New Zealand First Delivers On Carbon Tax Promise</p>
<p>The Rt Hon Winston Peters welcomed the announcement today that the government will be scrapping its proposed carbon tax as a consequence of a review which was established as part of New Zealand First&#39;s supply and confidence agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;We were always confident that if a thorough review was done of the carbon tax proposal, that it would be exposed as the folly that most of us knew it to be,&quot; said Mr Peters.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not to minimise the need to be vigilant in addressing environmental issues, but rather to recognise that more appropriate mechanisms exist to better achieve the same end.</p>
<p>&quot;The government&#39;s decision is a victory for the thousands of New Zealanders who were not well placed to carry the burden of another tax, particularly those on low and fixed incomes.</p>
<p>&quot;It also highlights just how decrepit the National party&#39;s ideas bank is and how meaningless their so-called petition has proven to be. The solution was always going to be based on a substantive review (which was the New Zealand First approach) rather than petty grandstanding.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Peters said this decision is a further step in what is proving to be a truly constructive arrangement between the government and New Zealand First on many fronts and to the benefit of all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand First looks forward to the development of a comprehensive programme that provides for reforestation, improved energy efficiency and greater investment in renewable energy,&quot; concluded Mr Peters.</p>
