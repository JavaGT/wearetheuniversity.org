<p><strong>Wednesday, 21 December 2005, 5:05 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon. Georgina te Heuheu MP<br>National Party Broadcasting Spokeswoman</p>
<p>21 December 2005</p>
<p>Maharey should be replaced too</p>
<p>National Party Broadcasting spokeswoman Georgina te Heuheu is welcoming the appointment of Sir John Anderson as the new chair of the TVNZ Board.</p>
<p>&quot;We certainly wish him well, he has a big job ahead of him.</p>
<p>&quot;But in order to deliver real change to TVNZ, Steve Maharey should have his head on the block.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a Minister who has presided over the shambles for most of the past six years.</p>
<p>&quot;Having already made a complete hash of the tertiary education portfolio before being replaced, he&#39;s fared no better in his role as Broadcasting Minister.</p>
<p>&quot;It is high time Mr Maharey took some responsibility for the failure of the charter, which leaked memos now reveal as a source of major discontent within the state-run TV network.</p>
<p>&quot;If Mr Maharey is really serious about tidying up the mess at TVNZ and giving the organisation a fresh start, then he must stand aside and let someone more capable fill his shoes,&quot; says Mrs te Heuheu.</p>
