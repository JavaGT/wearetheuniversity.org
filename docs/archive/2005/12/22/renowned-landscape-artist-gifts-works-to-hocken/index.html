<p>Renowned landscape artist gifts works to Hocken</p>
<p>Prominent New Zealand landscape artist Douglas MacDiarmid has gifted a large collection of his works to the Hocken Collections at the University of Otago.</p>
<p>The 90 works, mainly in pastel and pen and ink, cover 50 years of MacDiarmid&#39;s career in New Zealand and Europe, and are valued at more than $200,000.</p>
<p>MacDiarmid is pleased the works are going to a place where they will be available to students, members of the academic community and, from time to time, the public, rather than being locked away in a storage vault.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m too old to face any more of the merchant gallery mentality and you will understand how much happier I&#39;ll be if my work can find its way into the prestigious Hocken Collections,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>University of Otago Auckland Centre Head Adrienne Molloy worked with MacDiarmid to secure the works and says the artist has given the works enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&quot;He was incredibly generous, forthright and charming about this gift,&quot; Ms Molloy says.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of the reason the Hocken exists is because of the generosity of artists and writers, and Douglas MacDiarmid is a tremendous example of this generosity,&quot; she says.</p>
