<p>Maori Party Statement regarding Resignation of Dr Rongo Wetere, Tumuaki of Te Wananga o Aotearoa</p>
<p>Dr Pita Sharples, Co-leader, Maori Party</p>
<p>15 December 2005</p>
<p>The Maori Party today acknowledged the significant contribution Dr Rongo Wetere, ONZM, has made through his leadership of Te Wananga o Aotearoa.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Wetere has led a virtual revolution of the mind, in the way in which Te Wananga o Aotearoa has elevated dramatically Maori interest in tertiary education&quot; said Dr Sharples, Co-leader of the Maori Party.</p>
<p>&quot;The role for Mäori at the Wänanga has been created to give Maori ownership of their destiny&quot; said Dr Sharples. &quot;Rongo&#39;s entrepreneurial leadership of that institution has created an entity for people, Maori and Pakeha, who have been failed or by-passed by the system, and for that this nation must be eternally indebted&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;What is remarkable, is the way in which Te Wananga o Aotearoa has truly become an institute of learning for all of Aotearoa - and which has reached out internationally to places such as Cuba, a nation which has one of the highest literacy rates in the world, and that is despite the sanctions against it, by the most powerful nation in the world&quot; said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Wetere has contributed to kotahitanga in Aotearoa by bringing together, under the umbrella of a single institution, Mäori and Pakeha. The Wananga itself is an expression of rangatiratanga, offering paths of self-determination for all peoples&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Maori Party commends the way in which Te Wananga o Aotearoa has become known for cultural diversity, for entrepreneurship, for nation-building. It has become the intellectual beacon to which the dis-enfranchised and the working classes have gravitated, as they strive to emancipate their minds from the mental poverty imposed upon them by mainstream educationalists&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Rongo Wetere has made creative and innovative contributions to the nation through Te Wänanga o Aotearoa. His impact on the educational landscape of this country has been immense&quot;.</p>
