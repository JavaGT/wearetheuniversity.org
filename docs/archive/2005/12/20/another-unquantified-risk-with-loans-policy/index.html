<p>Hon. Bill English MP<br>National Party Associate Finance Spokesman</p>

<p>Another &#39;unquantified risk&#39; with loans policy</p>
<p>National Party Associate Finance spokesman Bill English says Labour&#39;s &#39;no interest&#39; student loan policy has another fishhook that the Government has conveniently forgotten to mention.</p>
<p>&quot;According to yesterday&#39;s Half Year Economic And Fiscal Update (Specific Fiscal Risks - Page 84), the student loans computer system may need a rebuild to handle the switch to the &#39;no interest&#39; policy. It&#39;s described as an &#39;unquantified risk&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;The costs of this are still being assessed, but you can bet this is not going to be cheap.</p>
<p>&quot;Here&#39;s another example to illustrate National&#39;s point that the real cost of this irresponsible and rushed policy will be much higher than Labour is letting on,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday, new costings revealed the taxpayer will face a massive up-front cost of more than $1 billion, the equivalent of giving away a significant state-owned enterprise for zero return.</p>
<p>&quot;The Treasury papers also show the number of borrowers will increase, the size of student debt will rise and voluntary repayments will almost dry up.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a policy that will provide most benefit to those with big loans.</p>
<p>&quot;So while Labour&#39;s enticing more students into debt and committing the taxpayer to rising future costs, it is trying to tell home-owners to tighten their belts because of the spending it is helping to push along.</p>
<p>&quot;For an increasingly arrogant Labour Government this is a classic case of do as I say, not as I do,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
