<p>AUT Media launches bimonthly magazine as its first publication</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s official launch of the bimonthly magazine Idealog marks the first product to come out of AUT Media, the new publishing arm of AUT University.</p>
<p>Idealog is targeted at “commercial creatives” whose job it is to create for a living – entrepreneurs, innovators, scientists, designers, marketers, technologists, engineers, artists, architects and communicators.</p>
<p>&quot;AUT University is strong in these creative disciplines and has become the university of choice for contemporary careers in these fields,” says Vice Chancellor, Derek McCormack.</p>
<p>“So we’re thrilled that Idealog is the first product out of AUT Media. Idealog reflects the creation last year of our Faculty of Design and Creative Technologies, which combines schools of art and design, mathematics, computer and information science, engineering and communication.&quot;</p>
<p>Idealog is the brain-child of AUT Media directors Vincent Heeringa and Martin Bell and of David MacGregor, a respected advertising and brand consultant.</p>
<p>Heeringa successfully founded Unlimited business magazine and Martin Bell is the former publisher of NZ PC World and Fast Forward magazine.</p>
<p>The publication has already attracted support from the local industry and relationships with key sponsors will see distribution start at 16,000 copies per issue. Sponsors include Telecom, Microsoft and intellectual property law firm, Baldwins.</p>
<p>Heeringa, Idealog editorial director, says the success of the new title reflects a substantial shift in the New Zealand economy from one based on commodity products to one based on world-beating ideas.</p>
<p>“Innovation is the driving force in business. The creative economy is here and it now has a voice: Idealog,” says Heeringa.</p>
<p>Former Computerworld editor and AUT alumnus Matt Cooney is the editor of Idealog. Under his editorship Computerworld became the fastest-growing weekly publication in the country with an online readership bettered only by the major dailies.</p>
