<p>Student newspaper Te Waha Nui wins an Ossie Surfer&#39;s Paradise</p>
<p>Te Waha Nui, AUT University&#39;s journalism newspaper, has won this year&#39;s Ossie Award for best student publication in Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific * the paper&#39;s second prize in a month.</p>
<p>The two-year-old publication won against four finalists from Australia and Fiji. All were print publications, although some included online editions. Judge Wendy Page, producer of ABC TV&#39;s Australian Story, said two strong contenders made the judging difficult, but she opted for the &quot;broad appeal&quot; of Te Waha Nui. &quot;It provides good news stories and good features with broad appeal, and is well written,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s clearly a huge commitment for student journalists to produce work of this calibre for a fortnightly publication. &quot;I think the standard is equal to, if not better than, many commercial newspapers. &quot;Te Waha Nui is not as glossy as some of the other publications, but the substance of the content won the day for me.&quot; Page highly commended a rival contender, The Point, a student-produced inner city community newspaper published by the University of Technology, Sydney.</p>
<p>Last month Te Waha Nui won the NZ Electoral Commission&#39;s Wallace Award for political reporting during the general election. The newspaper was edited this semester by journalism student Nicholas Moody and the course is led by AUT&#39;s David Robie and Allan Lee.</p>
<p>The Ossie Awards, organised by the Journalism Education Association (JEA) are named after the late Australian foreign correspondent Osmar White. More information about Te Waha Nui is available at <a href="http://www.tewahanui.info">www.tewahanui.info</a></p>
