<p>Hon Bill English National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>7 December 2005</p>
<p>Government watchdog had conflict of interest</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English, says the Labour Government paid close to $130,000 to a senior advisor with a conflict of interest over te Wananga o Aotearoa.</p>
<p>In 2002, Labour appointed Graeme McNally as its watchdog at the wananga.</p>
<p>Mr McNally is a partner at Deloittes - the same accounting firm that, in the 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 financial years, gave the wänanga a clean bill of financial health.</p>
<p>Deloittes carried out the audit of the wänanga under delegation from the Auditor-General, who is required by statute to audit the financial accounts of the wänanga.</p>
<p>In Parliament today, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen confirmed that when the conflict of interest was discovered, Mr McNally&#39;s employment was terminated.</p>
<p>It appears the conflict went unacknowledged by Government ministers and officials for more than two years.</p>
<p>&quot;This raises serious questions about the procedures used by Labour in managing conflicts of interest, and comes on top of officials failing to recognise a significant conflict of interest at Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology involving a senior staff member,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>He says he will ask the State Services Commissioner to investigate whether there are further conflicts of interest among the government&#39;s advisors in the tertiary sector.</p>
