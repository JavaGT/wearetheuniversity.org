<p>Hon Bill English National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>19 December 2005</p>
<p>Hit list schools still vulnerable</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English, says dozens of schools on a secret Ministry of Education &#39;hit list&#39; are still vulnerable to closure.</p>
<p>He is commenting on the public release of a list of schools targeted for closure under Labour&#39;s network review process.</p>
<p>The school review policy specifies three different events that can trigger a large-scale school review, despite Labour&#39;s &#39;moratorium&#39; on closures:</p>
<p>* Where concerns about educational quality are raised as a result of adverse Education Review Office (ERO) reports.<br>* Where two or more schools ask to be reviewed with the aim of strengthening the quality of education provided to local students.</p>
<p>* Where schools apply for a change in structure.</p>
<p>Mr English says this means the moratorium is full of holes.</p>
<p>&quot;One school can trigger a review of dozens of schools.</p>
<p>&quot;I am also concerned about the loose way the review papers deal with quality. The statements reportedly made about education in Gore schools in my electorate are just plain wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;School closures throw entire communities into disarray. If the Government wants to continue with its review process it needs objective evidence of problems, not just hearsay and prejudice,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
