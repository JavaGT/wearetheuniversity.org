<p>Hon Bill English MP National Party Associate Finance Spokesman</p>
<p>19 December 2005</p>
<p>Cullen in denial over loans cost</p>
<p>&quot;Michael Cullen&#39;s own papers support National&#39;s view that the &#39;no interest&#39; student loan policy will cost $1 billion next year and more than $400 million each year after that,&quot; says National Party Associate Finance spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;National has compared the costings produced by Treasury on the only basis that matters - the impact on the Government&#39;s surplus, or operating balance. Each time the Treasury estimate the effect of this policy on the government books, the cost rises.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the increase is due to accounting changes, but most of the increase is because Treasury believes students will borrow more and repay less.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Cullen&#39;s costings leave out the more than $1 billion loss to taxpayers which will appear on the Government&#39;s books next year.</p>
<p>&quot;National has used conservative numbers from Treasury papers. Other Treasury estimates show an even higher cost.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has no credibility left on this issue. It initially denied Treasury had done any costings and then tried to hide them until after the election. Labour simply doesn&#39;t want people to know how expensive this policy is.</p>
<p>&quot;So, Dr Cullen is clearly choosing to use costings which paint this policy in the best possible light.</p>
<p>&quot;The papers released today do confirm a massive up-front cost of more than a $1 billion. They are at least the fourth set of costings we have had for this policy.</p>

<p>&quot;The simple fact is that Dr Cullen has an agenda to talk down the impact of this policy. It is in his and Labour&#39;s interests.</p>
<p>&quot;What he cannot argue with are the unanimous forecasts which show borrowing will increase, the number of borrowers will rise, and the level of voluntary repayments will virtually evaporate.</p>
<p>&quot;The Finance Minister is dancing on the head of a pin and he knows it,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
