<p>Maharey misleads over NCEA re-marking</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English, says Education Minister Steve Maharey has misled the public over the extent of the re-marking of this year&#39;s NCEA exam papers.</p>
<p>The NZQA&#39;s Monitoring and Marking Update, released today, claims that just eleven of the 335 NCEA standards have been re-marked, but Mr English says the number is likely to be considerably higher than that.</p>
<p>In Parliament today, he questioned Mr Maharey on an email he has received from a marker saying that &#39;check markers are hammered by the NZQA, and have to instruct markers to &quot;tweak&quot; results to ease more candidates up into the achieved category and/or, if necessary, massage the marking schedule to ensure more candidates can achieve&#39;.</p>
<p>A further email from a &#39;check marker&#39; to a group of markers asks them to go back over the papers of students who failed, to see if they can &quot;push them up&quot; to &#39;achieved&#39;. It suggests that any sign at all of a student understanding the question is sufficient to change the grade.</p>
<p>The check marker says the re-marking is required because the number of &#39;not achieved&#39; grades is too high.</p>
<p>The email refers to examinations not on NZQA&#39;s list of those that have been officially re-marked, and shows that re-marking has not followed the official process.</p>
<p>Mr English says concerns raised by this exam marker indicate there could be widespread, unofficial and secret re-marking that is not part of the official process as outlined by Steve Maharey last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly, the political pressure from Mr Maharey to ensure the NZQA gets the &#39;right&#39; results is so great that NZQA is now heavying markers into passing students who would otherwise have failed, outside the official process.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey must now come clean with the public and reveal the true extent of re-marking of NCEA exams, both official and unofficial,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
