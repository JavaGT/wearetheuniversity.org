<p>Locke appeals to Iraqi captors to set Aucklander free</p>
<p>Below is the letter that Keith Locke has sent today to the captors of Harmeet Sooden, via Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>Appeal to the Captors of New Zealand peace worker Harmeet Sooden</p>
<p>Assalamu alaikum</p>
<p>I am a Green Party Member of Parliament in New Zealand. I am the party&#39;s spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and have long campaigned against the US-led invasion of Iraq and the occupation of Iraq. See <a href="http://www.greens.org.nz">www.greens.org.nz</a> for our statements over the last four years.</p>
<p>I read in today&#39;s paper that my fellow Aucklander Harmeet Sooden has been seized in Baghdad along with three other members of a Christian Peacemaking Team. The captives were shown yesterday on Al Jazeera TV, and described as being in the custody of the Swords of the Righteous Brigade.</p>
<p>It is clear from the information I have seen in New Zealand that my fellow Aucklander Harmeet Sooden, who has been seized in Iraq, is a peace worker, not a spy. He is a courteous student at the University of Auckland, well-respected by his friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>The evidence I have also suggests that the Christian Peacemaking Teams operate independently of any government and are not supporters of the US-led invasion and occupation.</p>
<p>I respectfully request that your organisation releases Mr Sooden and his fellow peace workers.</p>
<p>I am sending this appeal to the Al Jazeera news service, in the hope that they will mention it in their reports and you will get to see or hear of it.</p>
<p>Most sincerely,</p>
<p>Keith Locke</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
