<p>University of Canterbury forms alliance with Chinese University</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury and the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law in Wuhan, China have signed an agreement to cooperate in areas of mutual academic interest.</p>
<p>A Memorandum of Understanding was signed on campus on this week by Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Sharp and Professor Wu Handong, President of the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law.</p>
<p>It provides for collaboration in teaching and research in the fields of accountancy, business and management, economics and trade relations. By signing the MOU the partner institutions agreed to contribute to increased international cooperation by implementing programmes and activities such as staff and student exchanges, scholarships and joint research projects.</p>
<p>Speaking to the eight-strong Zhongnan delegation, Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Business and Economics) Professor Nigel Healey said the agreement was significant for UC, particularly for the College of Business and Economics.</p>
<p>“As part of the strategy of the College we recognise China will be New Zealand&#39;s major trade partner and so as part of our research we need to understand Chinese business and trade with China. We have been looking for an alliance with a Chinese university to help develop that research capability and those networks and as we are very much involved with Christchurch&#39;s sister city relationship with Wuhan this is an ideal link for us.</p>
<p>“We see this alliance as a way of working together to build our understanding of each other&#39;s countries, economies and trade relations,” Professor Healey said.</p>
<p>Professor Wu responded by saying the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law was honoured to cooperate with Canterbury University.</p>
<p>“This is the first step for our university and your university to cooperate. As our country and your country, and our city and your city are partners, so our university and your university will be partners in the 21st Century.”</p>
<p>The initial term of the agreement is for three years commencing 1 January 2006.</p>
