<p>NCEA: more evidence of re-marking</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English today released a further two emails from NCEA markers claiming there is pressure to pass students who would otherwise have failed, in order to reach required pass rates as dictated by the NZQA.</p>
<p>One of the emails says &#39;we are forced to push through students who have not achieved into the achieved category who clearly have no knowledge of [the subject] at this level.&#39;</p>
<p>Mr English says this kind of rejigging will create problems for students down the track.</p>
<p>&quot;Pushing students through to the next level when they are not ready will make next year difficult for them.</p>
<p>&quot;These emails back up a statement made by the principal of a Christchurch high school on radio this morning, confirming markers had told him they are under pressure to meet pre-determined pass rates,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Education Minister Steve Maharey continues to avoid the issues with NCEA by launching personal attacks on myself, and anyone else concerned, about fair and valid assessment for students.</p>
<p>&quot;However, continuing concerns from parents, exam markers and now school principals show there is significant anxiety about the level of unofficial re-marking of NCEA papers.</p>
<p>&quot;NZQA is under enormous pressure to avoid the embarrassment of last year&#39;s exams by producing non-controversial exam results in January. Judging by the extent of re-marking so far, it will be a miracle if they are not perfect,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
