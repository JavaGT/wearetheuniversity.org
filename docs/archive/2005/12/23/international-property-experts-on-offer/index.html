<p>MEDIA RELEASE<br>23 DECEMBER 2005</p>
<p>International Property Experts On Offer</p>
<p>Property professionals and investors seeking an edge have an opportunity in January to attend an Industry Day run by The University of Auckland Business School&#39;s Department of Property. The day is associated with the Twelfth Pacific Rim Real Estate Society (PRRES) Conference being co-hosted by the University.</p>
<p>Department of Property Senior Lecturer Deborah Levy says that the Industry Day, sponsored by IPD (Investment Property Databank) and the Property Council of Australia, is a good opportunity for professionals and investors to learn from the best in their field.</p>
<p>&quot;We are delighted to have a number of very high calibre international speakers taking part in the Industry Day,&quot; says Ms Levy. &quot;They will be covering a wide range of topics including trends in property markets, the changing roles of property professionals and property investment from an investor&#39;s perspective. The day also includes a session on successful joint venture research projects between universities and industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Property is currently a hot topic in New Zealand and we see both the Industry Day and the conference itself as a good opportunity to learn more about its different perspectives. I would encourage anyone interested in the property market to come along.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Levy says that the theme of the conference, &quot;Extending the Boundaries&quot;, refers to boundaries relating to academic excellence and industry as well as geographical boundaries.</p>

<p>The second speaker is Sing-Cheong (S.C.) Liu, founder and Managing Director of Pearl River-Hang Cheong Real Estate Consultants Ltd (of Hong Kong and Guangzhou, China), a company that provides comprehensive land and property development consulting services for leading local and foreign developers as well as the Guangzhou Municipal Government.</p>
