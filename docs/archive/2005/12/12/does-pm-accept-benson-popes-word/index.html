<p>Does PM Accept Benson-Pope&#39;s Word?</p>
<p>Rodney Hide Monday,<br>12 December 2005<br>Press Releases - Other</p>
<p>ACT Leader Rodney Hide said today that Prime Minister Helen Clark must state whether she still accepts the word of her Social Development and Employment Minister, David Benson-Pope.</p>
<p>&quot;Back on 17 May, Prime Minister Helen Clark had no qualms about accepting her Minister&#39;s word,&quot; Mr Hide said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Prime Minister told National Radio&#39;s Morning Report that David Benson-Pope, &#39;has assured me that he has used corporal punishment in line with school policies in the past and refutes the allegations&#39; that he assaulted a student by tying his hands to the desk and jamming a tennis ball into his mouth. She said, &#39;I accept the Minister&#39;s word. The Minister has given his word in Parliament&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;But since then the Police have completed the report that Prime Minister Helen Clark instigated, and found &#39;Evidentially there is sufficient evidence to say that this incident did occur and Philip WEAVER did have a tennis ball put in his mouth and his hands taped to the desk&#39;. David Benson-Pope himself is now no longer prepared to repeat his denials and refutations in Parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t believe that the Prime Minister can still accept Mr Benson- Pope&#39;s word, and his presence in Cabinet and in Parliament just shows that under Helen Clark there are no standards - just Helen Clark maintaining her power at any cost,&quot; concluded Rodney Hide.</p>
