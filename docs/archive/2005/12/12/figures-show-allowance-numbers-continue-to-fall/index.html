<p>Figures show student allowance numbers continue to fall</p>
<p>StudyLink figures, posted on their website over the weekend, show that only 54,621 students had received a student allowance for the July - September period this year, 4,031 less than the same time for last year and 7,077 less than this time in 2003.</p>
<p>“Student Allowance eligibility under the Labour Government has continued to fall throughout 2005, despite the Labour-led Government announcing in Budget 2004 that more students would receive allowances this year,” said Camilla Belich, Co President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>“The 7% decrease in students receiving allowances shows that the small changes to allowance eligibility criteria haven’t worked and haven’t given more students allowances.”</p>
<p>“The answer to this problem is simple and long overdue. A living allowance for all students would mean students would know what they are entitled to when they study. Students would no longer be forced to borrow to live and, as a result, total student debt and borrowing would reduce.”</p>
<p>“This Christmas many students will be looking forward to the grisly prospect of a New Year of borrowing off the Government for basic essentials like rent, power, phone, and food expenses.”</p>
<p>“Michael Cullen must act immediately to ensure that Labour’s policy of 50% of all students receiving an allowance is implemented by Budget 2006 at the latest because at the moment, Labour is well short of this goal,” Belich said.</p>
