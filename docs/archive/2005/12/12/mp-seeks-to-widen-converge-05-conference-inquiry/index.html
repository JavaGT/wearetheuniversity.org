<p><strong>Monday, 12 December 2005, 9:13 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>MP seeks to widen Converge ‘05 conference inquiry</p>
<p>National Party MP David Carter wants an Auditor-General’s inquiry into the Converge ’05 Conference widened to examine the involvement of the Christchurch City Council.</p>
<p>“In an answer to a Parliamentary Written Question, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise say that only 84 people attended the conference. Did ratepayers get value for their $500,000 contribution?” asks Mr Carter.</p>
<p>National MP Katherine Rich has already called on the Auditor-General to undertake an inquiry into the process by which New Zealand Trade and Enterprise granted $250,000 to Converge ‘05.</p>
<p>Mr Carter wants that investigation extended to cover other aspects, including a possible conflict of interest, discrepancies in the reporting of how many attended, and differences of opinion about who actually recommended the ratepayer-funded grant.</p>
<p>“Some $750,000 of public money was tied up in these two grants alone. I think we need some answers,” says Mr Carter.</p>
<p>In his letter, Mr Carter says: “Recent media coverage has suggested the Christchurch City Council and Canterbury Development Corporation may see fit to repeat the Converge Conference.</p>
<p>“I would be concerned if such a decision was made before the Audit Office has had the opportunity to confirm the appropriateness of all previous ratepayer expenditure on this exercise.”</p>
<p>Katherine Rich earlier said NZTE needed to explain what was achieved from sinking $250,000 into the Converge ‘05 conference, held last October.</p>
<p>“I can’t fathom why money was spent on sending the convenor to the UK to recruit international participants when not one overseas recruit was secured,” she said.</p>
