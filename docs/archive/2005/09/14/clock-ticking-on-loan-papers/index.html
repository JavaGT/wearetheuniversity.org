<p>John Key MP National Party Finance Spokesman</p>

<p>Clock ticking on loan papers</p>
<p>National Party Finance spokesman John Key says Michael Cullen should tell New Zealanders if he has any intention of releasing all the background papers on Labour&#39;s student loan policy before the election.</p>
<p>&quot;Will Dr Cullen do the right thing before the election?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Key is referring to a National Party request for the full costings and all the background material done on Labour&#39;s student loan policy.</p>
<p>An earlier official information request was declined and the Ombudsman is now progressing an urgent investigation into the reasons behind Dr Cullen&#39;s decision to withhold the papers.</p>
<p>&quot;First, Labour said there were no costings. Then there were.</p>
<p>&quot;Then Labour said it wasn&#39;t Government policy, then it appeared on taxpayer-funded pledge cards.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour said it would cost only between $100 million and $300 million, then they shouted down the experts who said the costing was far too light.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s last-minute student loan policy sets all the wrong incentives. It encourages students to borrow the maximum and repay the minimum.</p>
<p>&quot;National is eager to make sure Dr Cullen tables the paperwork before the election so voters can make an informed choice,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
