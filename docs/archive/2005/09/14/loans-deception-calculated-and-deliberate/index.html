<p>Hon Bill English MP National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>14 September 2005</p>
<p>Loans deception calculated and deliberate</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard, Michael Cullen and Helen Clark have consistently lied about the cost of their student loan policy,&quot; says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>Treasury costings released by order of the Ombudsman today reveal the true cost of Labour&#39;s student loan policy - to taxpayers and students.</p>
<p>&quot;This deception has been so calculated and deliberate that it almost defies belief.</p>
<p>&quot;In interview after interview this trio has claimed that their irresponsible policy would have a maximum cost of $300 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Reports prepared by the Treasury, both Michael Cullen&#39;s fudged version and the more realistic earlier versions, show that it will cost much, much more than that.</p>
<p>&quot;Thousands of well-meaning students and their families have been deceived by Labour.</p>
<p>&quot;Treasury states that this policy will add $2.4 billion to government debt by 2008/2009. Within ten years the policy will have added $10. 3 billion to government debt.</p>
<p>&quot;By 2020 Labour&#39;s policy will have led to a $5 billion increase in student debt.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only will Labour&#39;s policy increase national debt, it will also increase student debt.</p>
<p>&quot;Under Labour&#39;s policy, student loan debt will increase to $10 billion by 2008/2009, as compared with the $9 billion it is set to increase to under current settings. By 2020, Labour&#39;s policy will have led to a $20 billion blow-out in debt.</p>
<p>&quot;This rank dishonesty proves that none of these Labour Ministers deserves to hold a ministerial warrant after this election,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
