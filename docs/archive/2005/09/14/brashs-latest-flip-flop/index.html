<p>Brash&#39;s latest flip flop</p>
<p>Don Brash has shown for all to see why he is not fit to be Prime Minister, after a shameful visit to Te Wananga O Aotearoa, where he delivered different messages to staff and students and the news media, Labour MP Pete Hodgson said.</p>
<p>&quot;Don Brash was a lion outside the gates of the wananga, and a lamb inside. He was not prepared to deliver his so-called harsh speech about the wananga to the staff and students. To their face he was as nice as pie, assuring them that they had a great future under National. Outside, with only the media around, he tried to use them as a political football. This is gutless and two-faced.</p>
<p>&quot;Brash&#39;s excuse was that he did not think his message was appropriate for a powhiri. When did Dr Brash become an expert on what you should and should not do at a powhiri? It does not matter what culture you are dealing with, if you want to be Prime Minister you need to be up front.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Once again Dr Brash shows that he will simply buckle under pressure. What would he be like facing Winston Peters in coalition? Or more frighteningly what would he do if the call came to send combat troops to Iraq?</p>
<p>&quot;On the same day, National tried to hide its Work for the Dole policy in its Environment policy. Once again Don Brash had no idea of how the policy would work not what its implementation would cost. It is not acceptable for a person who wants to be Prime Minister to put out policy, and have no idea how it would work in practice. This appalling lack of grasp on policy repeats the same problem Brash had with National&#39;s foreign, health, housing and forestry policies.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders deserve a credible and up front leader. That is what we have with Helen Clark. Don Brash is simply not fit to be Prime Minister&quot;, Mr Hodgson said.</p>
