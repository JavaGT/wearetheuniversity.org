<p>Hon Steve Maharey<br>Minister for Social Development and Employment</p>
<p>14 September 2005 Media Statement</p>
<p>$14 million boost for Strengthening Families</p>
<p>The government&#39;s Strengthening Families initiative will receive an extra $14 million over the next four years, Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey announced today.</p>
<p>&quot;Strengthening Families is a programme that works,&quot; Steve Maharey said. &quot;The Labour-led government has invested heavily in services for families and this latest funding boost will mean agencies working with us will be better able to serve their communities.&quot;</p>
<p>Strengthening Families involves government and community agencies working together with at-risk families to support and improve family health, educational achievement, and reduce abuse, neglect and youth offending. The funding boost has resulted from a review of the initiative, which showed that Strengthening Families is a good way to deliver services to families with multiple needs.</p>
<p>“A major advance in the implementation of Strengthening Families is the provision of $1 million this financial year and $2.75 million in future years to compensate community organisations for carrying out the lead agency role, which they have not previously been funded for.</p>
<p>&quot;The funding will also be used for increasing the availability of facilitators and co-ordinators, and for their training and support.&quot;</p>
<p>Steve Maharey said Labour&#39;s continued support for families stood in stark contrast to National&#39;s policies that would lead to greater dependence on benefits, rising poverty and growing inequality within communities.</p>

<p>&quot;Over the past six years, Labour has focused on delivering practical achievements for New Zealand families. We&#39;ve helped hundreds of thousands of people move off benefits, we&#39;ve helped lift tens of thousands of children out of poverty and we&#39;ve helped build a strong economy where all New Zealanders can get ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;National is willing to raise rents for state house tenants and willing to cut Family Support to fund a $92 a week tax cut for the richest 3 per cent of New Zealanders. National&#39;s policies would lead to increasing need for food banks and support from community agencies.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, National&#39;s tax cuts would leave New Zealand so heavily in debt that a Brash government would not be able to adequately support the work of social service agencies. National is offering a recipe for social crisis and would lead a government powerless to confront it.&quot;</p>
