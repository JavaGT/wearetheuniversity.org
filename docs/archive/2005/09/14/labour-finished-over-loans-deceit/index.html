<p>Labour finished over loans deceit</p>
<p>Rodney Hide<br>Wednesday, 14 September 2005<br>Press Releases - Taxation</p>
<p>ACT Leader Rodney Hide said today that Treasury costings of Labour&#39;s interest-free student loans had sunk any chance of Labour being re-elected to office on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The documents show that Labour cannot be trusted. Labour has consistently and knowingly misled New Zealanders about the true cost of the policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has ruthlessly attacked anyone who has dared to question Labour&#39;s claim that free loans would cost only $300 million a year.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has attempted to cover up the true cost of the policy by refusing to release Treasury advice.</p>
<p>&quot;We now know that Labour attempted to mislead New Zealanders and they can&#39;t be trusted.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark has striven to make her integrity the election issue. She is now sunk. We now know that she and the Labour Government that she leads has none,&quot; Mr Hide said.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
