<p><strong>Wednesday, 14 September 2005, 1:49 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Don Brash MP National Party Leader</p>
<p>14 September 2005</p>
<p>A Bledisloe test NZ must win</p>
<p>National Party Leader Don Brash says he is determined to make sure more of our young people can see their future in New Zealand.</p>
<p>He made the comments during a meeting today with Napier grandmother Rosemarie Edwards. Three of her four daughters and their families are now living overseas. &quot;I first met Rosemarie by chance a year ago at Napier airport. I had been speaking around the country of how we need to build a society and an economy that would encourage our children and grandchildren to build their future in New Zealand, not overseas.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation that Rosemarie and her family find themselves in is typical of what is happening to our country. Over the past two years I have met with thousands of people who find that a family reunion now requires them finding their passport. &quot;She later described to me the struggles she and her partner have running a small business in Hawke&#39;s Bay, working seven days a week, two of them for the government.</p>
<p>&quot;On Saturday, New Zealanders can vote to change that. On Saturday, mainstream New Zealanders can vote for a National Government that is determined to make sure more of our children see a future here, rather than being forced to look to greener pastures overseas.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a comprehensive plan to help start turning the tide. We&#39;ll have exams, not more excuses. We&#39;ll have a welfare safety net, not more drift nets. We&#39;ll be about Kiwi, not just about iwi. We&#39;ll make criminals do the time, no more of letting them out in no time. Most importantly, we&#39;ll have a tax policy that gives an incentive to work hard. 85 percent of taxpayers will keep more than 80 per cent of every dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;We will reward hard work, encourage enterprise and help our economy grow faster. These are the Kiwi values that have always served this country well.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders have had six years of Labour ignoring the mainstream. We&#39;ve had six years of their high tax and waste.</p>
<p>&quot;National advocates a return to hard-working New Zealand values, lower taxes and less waste, and a commitment to mainstream New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike Labour and the Greens, we are not prepared to concede defeat to Australia. We are not prepared to see the gap in incomes continue to widen. This is a Bledisloe Cup test we must win,&quot; said Dr Brash.</p>
