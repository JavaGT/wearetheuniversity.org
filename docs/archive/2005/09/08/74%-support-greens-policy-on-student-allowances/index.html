<p>Poll shows 74% support Greens&#39; policy on student allowances</p>
<p>The Greens are today calling on all other political parties to follow their lead in supporting a universal living allowance for all fulltime students, following a poll showing three quarters of those surveyed want allowances extended.</p>
<p>The nationwide poll conducted by Colmar Brunton has found that 74 percent of the 700 people interviewed believed that more students should receive a living allowance.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greens have been saying since 1999 that if you&#39;re a fulltime student, you should be getting a living allowance,&quot; Tertiary Education spokesperson Nandor Tanczos says</p>
<p>&quot;Students are the only adults in our society who are unable to take full-time work and are often excluded from income support. It&#39;s time this inequity is addressed so that students no longer have to borrow money just to pay the bills.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not just a question of increasing the number of students getting an allowance of some kind, if that just means a few more people getting ten dollars a week. All full-time students should get a full allowance.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s moves on student support are better than nothing, but they don&#39;t address one of the main drivers of debt in the first place, having to borrow to live.</p>
<p>&quot;Only the Greens will ensure that the issue of student allowances is on the next Government&#39;s agenda and the best way to make sure that that happens is to Party Vote Green, &quot; Nandor says.</p>
