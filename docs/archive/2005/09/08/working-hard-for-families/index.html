<p><strong>Thursday, 8 September 2005, 9:04 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>

<p>Judith Collins Family and Welfare Spokesperson</p>
<p>Working Hard for Families</p>
<p>National on families Families are the crucial building blocks of our society. National knows how important families are and is determined to give families the best chance to provide a secure upbringing for our children. In today&#39;s world more and more pressure is placed on families. National understands that pressure and will make government more family-friendly.</p>
<p>Fair tax plan for families The tax burden on all New Zealanders is too high. National understands families need a break. National will let families keep more of their income, so our kids get a better start. National will:</p>
<p>* Use some of the government&#39;s $7 billion annual surplus to reduce income tax in April 2006 and again in April 2007<br>* Tax income up to $12,500 at 15%, from $12,500 to $50,000 at 19% and from $50,000 to $100,000 at 33%<br>* Reduce tax on extra work from 33% to 19% for the average wage earner<br>* Retain Working for Families, but redesign it so that incentives are provided automatically via the tax system</p>
<p>The Fair Tax Plan means:</p>
<p>* Families with a single income of $45,000pa and one child under 13 will be $102 a week better off next year<br>* Families with a single income of $50,000pa and two children under 13 will be $131 a week better off next year<br>* Families with two incomes of $50,000 and $20,000 and three children under 13 will be $106 a week better off next year</p>

<p>Childcare Childcare costs are a serious burden for many families. Parents need help with these costs and they need flexibility when making their childcare choices. National will:</p>
<p>* Make pre-school childcare costs tax deductible for up to $5,000 per child<br>* Allow costs to be deducted at 33%, giving a tax refund of up to $1,650 a child per year<br>* Make the deduction available for all forms of pre-school childcare, including registered childcare centers, nannies or home-based care</p>
<p>Better schooling A decent education is the greatest gift a community can give its children. Far too many Kiwi kids are not getting this gift. National will change this. National will:</p>
<p>* Continue to grow the education budget<br>* Reduce waste and spend more money on schools<br>* Bring in national standards for English and maths<br>* Provide vouchers to parents whose children have trouble with reading or maths<br>* Overhaul NCEA and give students grades that can be understood<br>* Remove Labour&#39;s rigid school zoning<br>* Tell parents how their children are getting on at school, and how well their school is doing</p>
<p>Improve access to healthcare The most vulnerable people in our society need better and faster access to affordable healthcare. National will:</p>
<p>* Continue to grow the health budget<br>* Cut Labour&#39;s huge waste of health dollars and reverse the decline in health sector productivity<br>* Maintain existing primary health subsides for the young, the retired and others that need support<br>* Develop a strategy to fight child obesity<br>* Introduce a dental health strategy for all school-age children<br>* Target 95% completion of immunisation and Well Child checks</p>
<p>More support for parents National values the work people do as parents and we will ensure parents have adequate backup when dealing with difficult children. National will:</p>
<p>* Promote parenting assistance, in particular for parents of children in the Youth Justice system<br>* Focus on early intervention for families most in need<br>* Support schools in their efforts to eliminate bullying and truancy<br>* Expand Parents as First Teachers, Family Start, and the HIPPY programme * Stop the political correctness undermining parents&#39; rights</p>
