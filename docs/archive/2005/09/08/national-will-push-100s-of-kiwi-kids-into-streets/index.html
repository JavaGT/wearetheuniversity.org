<p><strong>Thursday, 8 September 2005, 3:51 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>8 September 2005</p>
<p>National will push thousands of Kiwi kids into the streets</p>
<p>The Greens are committed to retaining income-related rents for state houses, and substantially increasing the number of state houses the Government provides.</p>
<p>Green Housing Spokesperson Sue Bradford, who released the party&#39;s housing policy this afternoon, said income-related rents for state houses were an integral part of any decent society.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s plan to revert to market rents and restart the sell off of state houses will push tens of thousands of Kiwi kids into poverty and out on to the street,&quot; Ms Bradford said. &quot;Dr Brash clearly hasn&#39;t learnt the painful lessons of the 1990s, and National is exhibiting yet again that it&#39;s simply not ready for government.</p>
<p>&quot;All the tax cuts in the world won&#39;t protect another generation of children from a legacy of ill health, poor education and lowered life expectancy as a result of substandard and transient housing conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>The Green Party is committed to allowing third-sector housing to flourish.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;d also like to see more priority and resources given to helping community-based housing initiatives. There is a lot of potential in the third-sector to provide a diversity of both rental and ownership options, and the Government should be doing much more to enable that potential to be realised.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Bradford said the Greens would be pushing Labour to build state houses at a faster rate than it has committed to.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe housing is a basic human right. Even after two terms of a Labour Government and the welcome return of income-related rents for state houses, far too many people are still living in substandard or overcrowded conditions. Labour&#39;s plans for new state houses are focused on Auckland, but there is an acute affordable housing shortage right around the country.</p>

<p>&quot;People who are well-housed have no idea of the circumstances in which some of our poorer families and individuals are compelled to survive. Improving the situation is imperative and is a key plank of our commitment to ending child poverty. It is also vital that we do everything we can to work towards environmentally friendly, energy-efficient housing.&quot;</p>
<p>Some of our key policies include:</p>
<p>- Creating a legal obligation on the Government to ensure housing needs are met.</p>
<p>- Providing adequate emergency and long-term housing, including for women suffering from violence, and for people with mental illness.</p>
<p>- Increasing Government resourcing and other support for community based and tangata whenua housing programmes.</p>
<p>- Getting half a million solar hot water panels into homes and buildings over the next five years.</p>
<p>- Ensuring new state housing is built according to sustainable building principles and design.</p>
<p>- Fostering innovative, environmentally friendly building skills and techniques in building and architecture.</p>
