<p>Happy end to airport fiasco</p>
<p>While Green Co-Leader Rod Donald was eating humble pie on the tarmac at Auckland Airport, his fellow passengers were eating fresh sandwiches courtesy of the aircraft&#39;s Air New Zealand pilots.</p>
<p>&quot;Concerned that the passengers had spent three hours waiting on the tarmac, our pilots bought us all the sandwiches in the airport café out of their own pockets,&quot; Mr Donald said.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly, the pilots of Flight 503 don&#39;t need training in public relations and communications. Their gesture was very well received by all the passengers on board.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Donald had earlier wrongly accused Auckland Airport of not maintaining the back-up generators for runway lighting. In fact, the Airways Corporation owns and operates the generators and is therefore responsible for this morning&#39;s airport shambles.</p>
<p>Mr Donald observed that Airways Corporation made a net operating profit after tax of $12.17 million to the year to June 2004, and paid the Government a dividend of $12 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps it would be prudent for the Government to let Airways Corporation keep more of its profit so that it can keep the lights on at Auckland Airport when they&#39;re needed.</p>
<p>&quot;Without doubt, this morning&#39;s disruption cost Air New Zealand hundreds of thousands of dollars.&quot;</p>
<p>It was revealed in April that the Airways Corporation had entered into a controversial cross-border lease, which boosted their coffers by $29.5 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of chasing windfall profits, the Corporation should stick to its knitting.&quot;</p>
