<p>Destiny NZ Party Distort The Truth</p>
<p>It is not a good look for a church-sponsored political party to engage in negative, divisive campaigning based on half truths and misinformation, says longtime Manukau resident and Manukau City Councillor Su&#39;a William Sio</p>
<p>Responding to negative comments by Destiny NZ Church Party leader Richard Lewis in the weekend, Su&#39;a says that the Destiny NZ Church party is publicly promoting incorrect information about Labour and the political system.</p>
<p>Destiny&#39;s party campaigned against Labour at the Otara Fleamarkets, and on Radio Samoa, misinforming Pacific people and the people of Manukau.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether that&#39;s intentional or the Destiny Party is simply ignorant of the facts, I don&#39;t know. I would have hoped that the Destiny Church&#39;s political party leader, given their so-called Christian platform, would at least present honest and correct information.&quot;</p>
<p>For example, says Su&#39;a, legislation for the Civil Union and Prostitution Law Reform Bill were private members bills. They were not introduced by any one party.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a personal conscience vote exercised by individual Members of Parliament - not the government - that pushed these bills into legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;Several Labour MPs voted against it. And the same voting pattern, for and against, happened across all party lines - National with Don Brash voting for the prostitution law reform. And so did the Maori Party leader Tariana Turia.&quot;</p>
<p>For criticizing Helen Clark saying that she is not a Christian, Su&#39;a says:</p>
<p>&quot;Let me remind people of Graham Capill, the former Christian party leader and ex-police prosecutor, who is now in prison for multiple sex offences against children. He campaigned vigorously on a platform of Christian virtues.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet, behind closed doors, this Christian leader was clearly a hypocrite of the lowest order, the most unchristian and repugnant of human beings, let alone any politician.</p>
<p>Su&#39;a asks Pacific people to judge the government on its track record in improving quality of life across the board for all people including Pacific people.</p>
<p>You know what you get with Helen Clark and Labour:<br>* Strong, stable government<br>* Experienced team<br>* Building on what we&#39;ve done - keeping the momentum going<br>New Zealand is going ahead:<br>* Economic growth<br>* Investment in people and skills * Research and development * Drive for high value economy/new technology * More Jobs<br>* Premium put on<br>* Universal health care * More teachers * Apprenticeships * Students/interest free loans * Security for families and older people<br>* Pride in national identity<br>* Achievements in our creative areas * Nuclear free - strong independent nation</p>
<p>Su&#39;a says, &quot;Don&#39;t put all this at risk. If you want a Labour - led government you have to vote for it.</p>
<p>A Labour-led Government, says Su&#39;a, will continue to give New Zealand a strong economy and carry out its responsibility to look after those who most need assistance and help.</p>
<p>&quot;Isn&#39;t that what Christian values are really about?&quot; says Su&#39;a. &quot;Not excluding people from the abundance and helping people in times of need. Helen Clark and this Labour-led government have consistently worked hard for all our communities.&quot;</p>
