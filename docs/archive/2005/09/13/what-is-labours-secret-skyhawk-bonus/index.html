<p>What is Labour’s secret Skyhawk bonus?</p>
<p>National’s Defence spokesman, John Carter, says Labour is hiding details of the Air Force strike wing sale bonus till after the election.</p>
<p>“The public has a right to know the size of the bonus paid to Ernst and Young for selling the aircraft.</p>
<p>“The company was paid an up-front fee of $400,000 and disbursements totalling something like $1 million and were to be paid a bonus on completion of the sale.</p>
<p>“But Defence Minister Mark Burton claims he cannot say what the bonus is till after the election, when the deal has been approved by the US Government.</p>
<p>“That is absolute rubbish.</p>
<p>“He can tell us now what the bonus is because it is the subject of an agreement between the Government and the company – it has nothing to do with the sale agreement or the US Government.</p>
<p>“What I suspect is happening is that Labour knows taxpayers are going to be angry at the size of the bonus – bearing in mind it has taken more than four years and $7 million in storage costs to complete the sale – and that’s why they will not tell us till after the election.</p>
<p>“Just like the land access issue, the Waikato pylons assessment, changes to the rural school bus service, and many others, Labour has shelved this controversial issue because it is worried about public reaction.</p>
<p>“They are just some of the many reasons taxpayers want to be rid of this arrogant Government,” says Mr Carter.</p>
<p>“Come clean, Mr Burton.”</p>
