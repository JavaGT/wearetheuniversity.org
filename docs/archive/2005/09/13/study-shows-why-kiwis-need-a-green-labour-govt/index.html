<p>Loan study shows why Kiwis need a Green-Labour Govt</p>
<p>The Green Party says a survey showing Kiwis currently pay the highest student loan interest rates in the world illustrates why young New Zealanders would be better off with a Green-Labour Government.</p>
<p>The survey released by the Educational Policy Institute found New Zealand&#39;s student loan interest rate of seven percent is higher than in any other comparable OECD country.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ve been drawing attention to the unreasonably high rate of interest on student loans for some time,&quot; Green Tertiary Education Spokesperson Nandor Tanczos says.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re pleased that Labour has announced policy to address this issue, and this international survey underlines why a Green-Labour victory on Saturday is so important to the future of this country.</p>
<p>&quot;If part of Government, the Greens will ensure that Labour prioritises its interest-free student loan pledge and, in addition, pursue our own policy of tackling the key drivers of debt - high tertiary fees and the narrow access to allowances.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand, the National Party is pledging to keep in place our highest-in-the-world student loan interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;National has criticised the interest-free student loan policy by claiming it will massively escalate student debt. This criticism demonstrates that, as with so many other areas of policy, National simply doesn&#39;t understand how the student loan system works and clearly assume that everyone thinks like a speculator.&quot;</p>
