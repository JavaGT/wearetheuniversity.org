<p><strong>Friday, 30 September 2005, 8:48 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>OUSA Election Results: Hail to the Chong</p>
<p>After weeks of enthusiastic campaigning, the chalk-fingered and glue-splattered candidates for the 2006 OUSA executive gathered at the university’s Gazebo Lounge tonight to hear the winners announced.</p>
<p>A total of 2173 students turned out to vote over the 4 days of the election, either at polling booths around campus or using OUSA’s state-of-the-art online voting system. Outgoing OUSA President Steven Sutton described the turnout as “impressive” and “a bit of a relief, really”.</p>
<p>Concerns had previously been raised about the effect the lack of contenders for the presidential position would have on voter turnout. Paul Chong, standing uncontested for president, was elected with 1619 votes. Competition for the presidential position usually helps to raise the profile of the election, and this is the first time in memory that only one person has stood for president.</p>
<p>However, according to Returning Officer Mark Heine, tight competition for other executive positions ensured a high-profile campaign and the ease of online voting guaranteed a high turnout.</p>
<p>“We had 7 people standing for Humanities Representative, and 5 people were standing for the two General Executive positions, so there’s plenty of interest out there” said Mr Heine. “This year’s turnout was very healthy.”</p>
