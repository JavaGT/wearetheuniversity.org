<p>Otago will be tight: David Parker</p>
<p>Otago MP David Parker today said the contest for the seat of Otago will be tight.</p>
<p>A Southland Times poll released today puts National in the lead to capture the Otago electorate. The poll of 501 people conducted early last week, has National candidate Jacqui Dean sitting on 36.1 percent and Mr Parker on 28.3 percent a difference of almost 8 percentage points.</p>
<p>Mr Parker said a Southland Times poll conducted at the same time before the last election had him trailing by around 12 percentage points. Mr Parker won the seat by 648 votes.</p>
<p>“The Otago seat is not a walkover for National,” said Mr Parker. “Yesterday’s poll said that 30% of people were either undecided or don’t want to reveal their voting intention.</p>
<p>“That’s a lot of people. I think it’s fair to say that Otago is a very marginal seat.</p>
<p>“I’ve worked very hard for the last three years to represent the interests of Otago people locally and in Wellington.”</p>
<p>“The result at the last election was an upset for National and I don’t think anyone should write off my chances of winning just yet.</p>
<p>Before entering Parliament in 2002 David Parker was a litigation partner with the largest South Island law firm and a businessman.</p>
<p>Hi extensive business experience as a general manager and a director have included many new ventures. He is the only MP to have taken a business from start-up to the New Zealand stock Exchange.</p>
<p>He serves on four select committees in Parliament and is married with three children.</p>
