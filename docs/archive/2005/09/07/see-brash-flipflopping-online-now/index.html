<p><strong>Wednesday, 7 September 2005, 11:22 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Trevor Mallard<br>Minister of Education</p>
<p>7 September 2005 Media Statement</p>
<p>See Brash flipflopping online now</p>
<p>The Don Brash Flipflopper is now available on line - a handy tool that shows National&#39;s policy confusions and what Dr Brash has promised will be Gone by Lunchtime, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said at the launch of the Gone by Lunchtime website today.</p>
<p>&quot;You can make Don Brash flipflop again and again - just like he does in real life - at <a href="http://www.gonebylunchtime.com">www.gonebylunchtime.com</a></p>
<p>&quot;There are also some key examples of what Don Brash has said will be gone by lunchtime if he is ever in power,&quot; Trevor Mallard said.</p>
<p>&quot;Voters can make Dr Brash flipflop back and forth on New Zealand&#39;s nuclear free policy, on support for the war on Iraq, on logging native forests, on defence funding and on potential coalition partners.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven&#39;t quite got to his flipflops on health funding, on annual leave, on ownership of schools. And there seems to be no end in sight to his flipflops on transport because his fight with Maurice Williamson over what to do with Auckland roads is still not over.</p>
<p>&quot;Do voters really want a flipflopper running the country. Labour does not think so.</p>
<p>&quot;And the Gone by Lunchtime list keeps growing every day, so it is not exhaustive either.</p>
<p>&quot;For instance, also Gone by Lunchtime under Dr Brash are the following:</p>
<p>- Undisclosed quantities of health and education services</p>
<p>- Kiwisaver scheme which provides a one-off deposit subsidy up to $5,000 ($10,000 for couples) for those who are first home buyers and who belong to the KiwiSaver government sponsored work-based savings scheme</p>

<p>- Funding for Primary Health Organisations aimed at providing cheap doctors visits</p>
<p>- $10 a week increase per child to combat child poverty - under Working for Families</p>
<p>- State houses</p>
<p>- Income-related rents for state houses</p>
<p>- 20 hours free early childhood education for three and four year olds at teacher-led centres</p>
<p>- Maori seats in Parliament</p>
<p>- Interest free student loans</p>
<p>- Television New Zealand and its charter for public broadcasting</p>
<p>- Health and safety protections that stop injuries and deaths at work</p>
<p>- Lunchtime</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
