<p>Kakapo Hatch a Name 2005 Competition Winners</p>
<p>Conservation Minister Chris Carter is pleased to announce the winners of a national competition among school children to name New Zealand&#39;s four new kakapo chicks.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<p>- Jade Cassidy (8yrs) of Sunnynook Primary School in Auckland, who chose the name Pounamu because it means &#39;precious jewel&#39;</p>
<p>- Yasmeen Musa (9yrs) of Waihopai School in Invercargill, who chose her own name Yasmin, which means flower in Arabic</p>
<p>- William Hewitt (15yrs) of Verdon College in Invercargill, who provided a compelling whakapapa for his winning entry Pura</p>
<p>- Kate Stretton (12yrs) of Rangiora High School in North Canterbury, who chose the name Kumi because it means fabulous creature.</p>
<p>“The Kakapo Hatch a Name 2005 Competition is a partnership between the Department of Conservation, Comalco New Zealand, the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society, and the Threatened Species Trust. It is designed to raise conservation awareness among children,&quot; Mr Carter said.</p>
<p>&quot;Over 2000 kids entered the competition, evidence of the enthusiasm many young New Zealanders feel for the rare and beautiful species that live in our country. I hope this enthusiasm grows into a life-long interest.&quot;</p>
<p>Each of the competition winners will get the chance to visit the kakapo chicks they have named on Codfish Island (Whenua Hou) in Southland. They have also won $1500 for their school provided by Comalco New Zealand, and membership of the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society’s Kiwi Conservation Club.</p>
