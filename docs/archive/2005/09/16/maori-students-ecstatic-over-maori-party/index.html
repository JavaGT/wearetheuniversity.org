<p>Mâori students ecstatic over Mâori Party youth policy</p>
<p>Today Mâori students celebrated as they read the details of the Mâori Party Rangatahi (youth) policy, launched earlier today. The policy details initiatives and priorities given to rangatahi development by the Mâori party.</p>
<p>“The initiatives proposed by the Mâori Party are fantastic; they show a true understanding of rangatahi Mâori realities and the issues we face on a day to day basis. Mâori students are absolutely ecstatic” said Veronica Tawhai, Kaitûhono for Te Mana Âkonga, the National Mâori Tertiary Students Association.</p>
<p>“For years and years parties youth policies have been out of touch, and almost always amounted to mere lip service. This is often caused by the lack of youth consultation as the basis of those policies” said Miss Tawhai. “The Rangatahi caucus of the Mâori Party have been supported to lead the development process and the policies themselves – and it shows; an insightful, in-depth policy which offers real answers and a real commitment to address our issues”.</p>
<p>“For example, the growth in Maori student debt is potentially sabotaging future Maori development. The Maori party’s proposed policies regarding debt repayments and a universal allowance are immensley important to Maori students and the future of Maori society as a whole”.</p>
<p>The Mâori Party policy supports several Te Mana Âkonga initiatives, including the Mâori student involvement in tertiary institutional decision-making and Mâori student representation on tertiary institution governance bodies. The support of these initiatives is part of the Mâori Party’s focus on establishing and further developing vehicles through which rangatahi can better participate and contribute across all levels of society.</p>
<p>“Te Mana Akonga applaud and thank the Mâori Party for this policy. They have shown a true understanding and commitment to the needs and aspirations of young people throughout Aotearoa. Finally, we have been given a real sense of hope and encouragement for the future”.</p>
