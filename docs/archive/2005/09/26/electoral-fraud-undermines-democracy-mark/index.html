<p>Electoral Fraud Undermines Democracy - Mark</p>
<p>New Zealand First law and order spokesperson Ron Mark is calling for an independent inquiry following reports of electoral fraud.</p>
<p>“We have a bizarre situation where we have a dog enrolled to vote; there have been reported cases of people buying the new Easy Vote cards in order to cast multiple votes; of students on study visas being able to vote; of under-age voters and of enrolment packs being sent to non-residents.”</p>
<p>Mr Mark said he is concerned that Easy Vote cards were used fraudulently and inappropriately, and that they may have been bought or transferred.</p>
<p>He is seeking confirmation from the Electoral Commission that the only people on the electoral roll are those who are genuinely entitled to vote.</p>
<p>“The electoral process needs a fresh set of eyes over it to ensure that its integrity cannot be breached. People need assurance that Easy Vote cards are secure and can only be used by those to whom they are issued.</p>
<p>“The postal voting system also needs to be reviewed, following reports of theft of postal voting forms from rubbish bins and letter boxes.</p>
<p>“It becomes farcical when people can buy or acquire votes through illegal means and it renders our voting system no better than those of countries like Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>“The right to vote is arguably the most valuable thing a New Zealander has. Anything less than a 100 percent secure system undermines that right and brings that system into disrepute,” said Mr Mark.</p>
