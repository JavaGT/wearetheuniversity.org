<p>Risk-taking in clubs explored</p>
<p>A Victoria University study into Wellington’s clubbing scene has found the most ‘dangerous’ illegal drugs are not the ones causing the most concern amongst club-goers.</p>
<p>Criminology Lecturer, Dr Fiona Hutton, investigated what goes on within Wellington’s youth scene - clubbing, dance parties, alcohol and other drug use, social groups, relationships and fashion – to uncover what type risk-taking behaviour is taking place.</p>
<p>Dr Hutton undertook qualitative interviews with 33 clubbers, within the 18-25 age range, and also consulted Wellington club owners and managers.</p>
<p>Dr Hutton says the young clubbers, some of whom were strongly opposed to being portrayed as users of illegal drugs, were mostly concerned about the lower-end, more affordable drugs available, including alcohol, herbal highs and GHB.</p>
<p>“The public are often led to believe that illegal drugs, such as Ecstasy, cause the biggest harm amongst club-goers. The reality is that, due to the young age of most clubbers, they are not able to afford these substances on a frequent basis, as a ‘pill’ can cost between $65-80.</p>
<p>“Although the higher-end drugs are certainly destructive, the clubbers highlighted other drugs with which they encountered more frequent risk-taking behaviour.”</p>
<p>GHB was a drug that clubbers identified as risky as it is affordable and easy to get hold of. GHB is a powerful, rapidly-acting central nervous system depressant and can put people in a very vulnerable state, especially when mixed with alcohol. A majority of respondents felt that GHB use for young women in particular put them in vulnerable positions especially where safe sex was concerned.</p>

<p>‘Herbal highs’ were also identified as a concern. Respondents stated that because ‘herbals’ were legal there was the perception that they were safe which was misleading and dangerous, since they can contain a high chemical component. Respondents commonly mixed ‘herbals’ with alcohol and stated that they made them feel like drinking a lot of alcohol. Every respondent expressed concern about the lack of information/education about ‘herbals.’</p>
<p>Alcohol was described by all respondents as a substance that increased their risk-taking behaviour, especially in relation to safer sex choices and personal safety. Respondents tended to mix alcohol with ‘herbals’ or when the effects of illegal drugs were wearing off.</p>
<p>“It is also important to note that the clubbers interviewed felt that the stereotype of ‘drug-crazed’ clubbers was wrong. In fact, to be seen to be out of control through alcohol and/or drug use was not acceptable and was perceived to be ‘uncool’.”</p>
<p>Dr Hutton, who has written a thesis on social behaviour within the British clubbing scene, says her research will provide valuable information for Wellington’s service providers.</p>
<p>“This snapshot of youth and club culture helps to establish which safety and health issues we could direct more attention towards.”</p>
<p>Dr Hutton is one of seven academics in the Institute of Criminology in the School of Social &amp; Cultural Studies at Victoria University. Victoria offers New Zealand’s only criminology major at undergraduate and postgraduate level.</p>
