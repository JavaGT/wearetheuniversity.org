<p>Economist Rates Otago Mba Amongst World’s Top 100</p>
<p>Otago MBA programme the only one in New Zealand to make elite ranking</p>
<p>The University of Otago School of Business has been officially recognised as the leading provider of MBAs in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Economist Intelligence Unit, the business arm of The Economist Group which publishes the Economist newspaper, has named the School of Business’s Otago MBA in its Top 100 MBA programmes – the only New Zealand MBA to be mentioned in the rankings.</p>
<p>“It is a great achievement for the School of Business and Otago MBA to be recognised in this prestigious ranking. The global MBA market is saturated with thousands of different institutions offering MBA programmes. To be ranked among the Top 100 is a major feat,” says Professor David Buisson, Dean of the School of Business.</p>
<p>“We are very honoured that Otago has been named among the cream of the world’s education institutions in this area.”</p>
<p>The Otago MBA sits alongside the renowned international business schools Stanford Graduate School of Business, Yale School of Management, Columbia Business School, London Business School and HEC School of Management (Paris) in the prestigious rankings, and is ranked among the top five business schools in Asia and Australasia.</p>
<p>According to Bill Ridgers, the editor of the Which MBA? (the education section of the EIU), the main things that set the ranked schools apart are a robust programme and excellent faculty.</p>
<p>“They often also possess a strong collegiate sense, meaning that students are keen to evangelise about their schools”.</p>

<p>The MBA rankings are based on results from questionnaires completed by business schools and around 20,000 MBA students and graduates around the world.</p>
<p>Business schools must show evidence they provide excellent career opportunities, personal development and educational experience, salary increases and the potential to network to their students.</p>
<p>The Economist Intelligence Unit rankings are considered to be more student-centric than other ranking systems measuring the way schools meet the expectations and demands that students have of an MBA programme.</p>
<p>The Otago MBA was the first full-time MBA to be offered in New Zealand and has earned a well-deserved reputation with business leaders and employers as a leading general management degree.  </p>
