<p>What about a universal allowance, Labour?</p>
<p>Labour is moving in the right direction on tertiary education, but needs to dig deep to fund a universal living allowance for students, the Green Party says.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re pleased Labour is moving the tertiary education system further away from the competitive model we had in the 1990s,&quot; Green Tertiary Education Spokesperson Nandor Tanczos said. &quot;The Greens have long said that we need to move away from a bums-on-seats approach to funding, and it&#39;s good to see Labour doing just that.</p>
<p>&quot;The bums-on-seats approach has led universities to spending obscene amounts of money marketing themselves at home and abroad, in a perverse attempt to compete with one another. I&#39;m hoping Labour and the Greens can work together after the election to ensure that these grossly inflated marketing budgets are reined in.</p>
<p>&quot;Furthermore, Labour&#39;s commitment to a quality tertiary education system must include paying all academics a decent wage.&quot;</p>
<p>Nandor said Labour&#39;s tertiary education policy had failed to deliver students what they most need: a universal living allowance set at the level of the unemployment benefit.</p>
<p>&quot;The only adults in society who are unable to take full-time work but excluded from the benefit system are tertiary students. It&#39;s time for this inequity to be addressed, and for a tremendous barrier to tertiary education to be removed.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark is on record as saying that she would love to reintroduce a universal student allowance. With more and more students struggling to make ends meet, perhaps it&#39;s time to take the bold step required.&quot;</p>
