<p>Nobel Physicist Lecturing</p>
<p>Professor Carl Wieman, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist from the United States, will deliver the Sir Douglas Robb Lectures at the University of Auckland in October.</p>
<p>He helped create a new form of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) by cooling atoms to a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero.</p>
<p>BEC is now a major international field of physics research. It could bring revolutionary applications in such fields as precision measurement and nanotechnology as well as developing faster and smarter electronics.</p>
<p>Professor Wieman, who is Distinguished Professor of Physics at the University of Colorado, has as his theme Two breakthroughs in physics research: New forms of matter at ultracold temperatures, and engaged students with deep understanding.</p>
<p>Professor Geoff Austin, who is organising the lectures, says the subject is highly topical given that 2005 has been designated the World Year of Physics</p>
<p>&quot;It celebrates the 100th anniversary of Albert Einstein&#39;s &#39;Miraculous Year&#39; while raising public awareness of physics. In 1905 Einstein, arguably the most famous physicist, wrote his legendary articles which provided the basis of three fundamental fields in physics: the theory of relativity, quantum theory and the theory of Brownian motion.&quot;</p>
<p>The first two lectures will cover Professor Wieman&#39;s groundbreaking research, and the third his efforts over many years to improve the teaching of physics and make the subject understandable, useful and interesting to more people.</p>
<p>The lectures, starting at 7pm in B28, Library Basement, 5 Alfred Street, are free and open to all.<br>Monday 10 October: &quot;Bose-Einstein condensation: Quantum weirdness at the lowest temperature in the universe&quot;.<br>Tuesday 11 October: &quot;Bose-Einstein condensation: A decade of surprises, spin-offs, and potential applications&quot;.<br>Thursday 13 October: &quot;Science education in the 21st century: Using the tools of science to teach science&quot;.</p>
