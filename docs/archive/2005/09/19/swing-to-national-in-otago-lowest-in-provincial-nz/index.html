<p><strong>Monday, 19 September 2005, 8:18 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Swing to National in Otago lowest in Provincial NZ</p>
<p>David Parker, until last night the Labour MP for Otago, today congratulated the new National MP Jacqui Dean and wished her and the electorate well.</p>
<p>David caused the upset of the 2002 election when he took the blue-ribbon seat of Otago for Labour with a majority of 684. It had been a National seat for all but 3 years in the last 65.</p>
<p>“It has been my privilege to serve the people of Otago for the last three years. I thank the people of Otago for their support over the last three years, and especially the 14,146 people who voted for me yesterday.”</p>
<p>“I am of course sad to lose, but am pleased that I maintained both my constituency votes (14,146 this time c.f. 14,113 in 2002) and my party votes (13,271 this time c.f. 12,943 in 2002). I was also gratified to win in Oamaru (Parker 4,966 Dean 4,663), despite that being home base for Jacqui Dean where she is well known.</p>
<p>“Interestingly the result, on a comparative basis, is one of the best in NZ for Labour. The swing to National is the lowest in any provincial seat in the country. This of course pleases me.”</p>
<p>‘The following table shows the relative change in votes in the electorates in the lower half of the south island:</p>
<p>Electorate 2002 margin 2005 margin Vote shift from</p>

<p>Aoraki 6453 to Labour 6616 to National 13069</p>
<p>“Clearly we ran an effective campaign in Otago. I thank the many volunteers on my campaign team for their sterling efforts.”</p>
