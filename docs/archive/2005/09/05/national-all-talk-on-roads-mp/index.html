<p>National &#39;all talk on roads&#39; - MP</p>
<p>National&#39;s track record on Auckland roading speaks for itself, says Auckland MP Ann Hartley.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ve currently got $1.3 billion worth of roading and transport infrastructure work under way in Auckland - 10 times the amount in progress when Labour took power from the National Government in 1999,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s very easy for National politicians to talk big before an election, but they did virtually nothing when they were the government in the 1990s.&quot;</p>
<p>Ann Hartley - MP for Northcote and a former North Shore city mayor - said that Auckland was well on the way to developing a reliable and efficient integrated transport system that would let Aucklanders move around their city with ease.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s what we need in Auckland, not political promises that their track record shows they won&#39;t keep,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at the North Shore bus way. When came in in 1999 all there was was talk talk talk. The planning and design had hardly begun, there was no resource consent, no funding and no work. It&#39;s now well under way and will shift thousands of commuters a day.&quot;</p>
