<p>Māori students ecstatic over Māori Party youth policy</p>
<p>Today Māori students celebrated as they read the details of the Māori Party Rangatahi (youth) policy, launched earlier today. The policy details initiatives and priorities given to rangatahi development by the Māori party.</p>
<p>“The initiatives proposed by the Māori Party are fantastic; they show a true understanding of rangatahi Māori realities and the issues we face on a day to day basis. Māori students are absolutely ecstatic” said Veronica Tawhai, Kaitūhono for Te Mana Ākonga, the National Māori Tertiary Students Association.</p>
<p>“For years and years parties youth policies have been out of touch, and almost always amounted to mere lip service. This is often caused by the lack of youth consultation as the basis of those policies” said Miss Tawhai. “The Rangatahi caucus of the Māori Party have been supported to lead the development process and the policies themselves – and it shows; an insightful, in-depth policy which offers real answers and a real commitment to address our issues”.</p>
<p>“For example, the growth in Maori student debt is potentially sabotaging future Maori development. The Maori party’s proposed steps to write off student debt are immensley important to Maori students and the future of Maori society as a whole”.</p>
<p>The Māori Party policy supports several Te Mana Ākonga initiatives, including the Māori student involvement in tertiary institutional decision-making and Māori student representation on tertiary institution governance bodies. The support of these initiatives is part of the Māori Party’s focus on establishing and further developing vehicles through which rangatahi can better participate and contribute across all levels of society.</p>
<p>“Te Mana Akonga applaud and thank the Māori Party for this policy. They have shown a true understanding and commitment to the needs and aspirations of young people throughout Aotearoa. Finally, we have been given a real sense of hope and encouragement for the future”.</p>
