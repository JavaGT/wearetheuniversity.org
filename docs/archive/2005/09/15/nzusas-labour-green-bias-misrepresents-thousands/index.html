<p>NZUSA&#39;s Labour-Green bias misrepresents thousands</p>
<p>Today&#39;s statement by the New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) urging people to vote Labour Greens misrepresents the political views of thousands of students who support parties of the centre right, Student Choice said today.</p>
<p>NZUSA claims to represent 180,000 New Zealanders, yet its latest declaration of support for Labour Greens on National Radio today once again demonstrates that it is a left-leaning organisation willing to misrepresent the views of students who support centre right parties.</p>
<p>Polls show significant support for centre right parties among student age groups, yet NZUSA continually endorses parties of the left.</p>
<p>Student Choice spokesman Glenn Peoples said NZUSA&#39;s misrepresentation is created by compulsory membership of student associations.</p>
<p>&quot;If students were free to choose whether or not they joined a group you&#39;d find they wouldn&#39;t join groups which promoted views which they don&#39;t support,&quot; Mr Peoples said. He said voluntary membership is essential to ensure students receive accurate and legitimate political representation.</p>
<p>Peoples said Labour and Green&#39;s ongoing support for compulsory membership highlighted both parties&#39; hypocrisy on human rights. &quot;Labour and Greens present themselves as champions of civil rights but are willing to violate students&#39; right to freedom of association because of the political support both parties receive from groups like NZUSA,&quot; Peoples said.</p>
