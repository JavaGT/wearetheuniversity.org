<p>15 September 2005</p>
<p>Ka pai to the &quot;mainstream&quot; New Zealanders who are giving it a go</p>
<p>&quot;Thirty-three years ago a Maori language petition (containing 30,000 signatures) was presented to Parliament. The request at the time was for Mâori language to be taught in schools. This day, 14 September 1972 was a significant event in the history of the Mâori language renaissance, said Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia.</p>
<p>&quot;Last night at the Mâori Language Week Awards I witnessed another &quot;significant&quot; event, I saw evidence of positive movement by non-Mâori New Zealanders towards respecting and pronouncing the language better.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of the award winners last night were representative of &quot;mainstream&quot; New Zealand. I was inspired by the contributions the awards nominees have made to the status of &#39;to tâtou reo rangatira&#39; in their workplaces and by their determination to celebrate the &quot;other&quot; official language of our country.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of the award winners acknowledged that Mâori language week is not about having te reo Mâori prominent during the week only, but that it serves as a springboard to further raise the levels of support, motivation and encouragement to the growth of te reo Mâori over time.</p>
<p>&quot;So, congratulations to the winners: Auckland City Council, Christchurch City Library, Christchurch Community House, Inland Revenue Department, NZQA, Waikato Institute of Technology, Albany Primary School, Diagnostic Medlab, Te Hiku Media, The Gisborne Herald and TV3.</p>
<p>&quot;These winners have taken our te reo Mâori to forums, arenas and heights that only a few generations ago Mâori people only dreamed of. No reira kia kaha, kia maia, kia manawanui.</p>
