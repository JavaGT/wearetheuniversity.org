<p><strong>Wednesday, 28 September 2005, 10:44 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_Press">Auckland University Press</a></strong></p>
<p>Wellingtonians have a rare chance next week to hear Vietnam War expert Dr Roberto Rabel speak on the political and diplomatic dimensions of New Zealand’s controversial participation in the Vietnam War in an MCH Seminar &quot;Reluctant Partners?: New Zealand&#39;s Involvement in the Viet Nam War&quot;.</p>
<p>Author of the new official history of New Zealand’s involvement in Vietnam, New Zealand and the Vietnam War: Politics and Diplomacy (Auckland University Press), he will give a public talk in Wellington on 5 October 2005.</p>
<p>The Vietnam War provoked a major crisis in New Zealand attitudes to foreign policy, breaking for the first time the almost universal consensus about how we should handle political and military issues beyond our shores.</p>
<p>The despatch of combat troops to assist the United States in Vietnam divided the country, enraged a generation and forced the government to publicly defend its policy.</p>
<p>New Zealand and the Vietnam War is the first major study of those events, the fruit of many years of detailed research drawing on government archives, newspapers, records of the protest movements and a range of other sources.</p>
<p>It explores the diplomatic history of the engagement, which is not well known or understood, and shows that officials and politicians in fact entered that war with extreme reluctance.</p>
<p>Running parallel with this is an account of the passionate domestic politics provoked by the war which has had such a long-term effect on New Zealand foreign policy.</p>
<p>New Zealand and the Vietnam War was published with the assistance of the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. It will be launched in Wellington at the end of October.</p>

<p>New from AUP<br>New Rights New Zealand: Myths, Moralities and Markets</p>
<p>Dolores Janiewski and Paul Morris</p>
<p>A penetrating picture of a powerful and passionate crusade, this account of the growth of the New Right in NZ 1984–1999 analyses New Right ideology in terms of its advocacy of political and civil rights over economic and cultural rights, draws attention to the moral aspects of those programmes, and explains how NZ differed in this respect from the US, UK and Australia.

<p>Diana Bridge</p>
<p>The sources of her poetry and her spare, elegant style give Diana Bridge an individual voice unlike any other. This collection teems with vivid images often drawn from Indian or Chinese sources but at its emotional core are the deaths of her mother and brother in a single year – these dominate one section but pervade the whole book in a way that is subtle, restrained but deeply moving. PB; 1 86940 346 0; $21.99.</p>
