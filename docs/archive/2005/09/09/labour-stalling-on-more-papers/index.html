<p>Gerry Brownlee MP National Party Maori Affairs Spokesman</p>
<p>09 September 2005</p>
<p>Labour stalling on more papers</p>
<p>National Party Maori Affairs spokesman Gerry Brownlee says Labour is stalling on the release of important papers just days out from the election.</p>
<p>&quot;National lodged an official information request for details on capacity building, capacity assessment, local level solutions and whanau development grants with Parekura Horomia&#39;s office in early July.</p>
<p>&quot;We still have not received a response, despite the intervention of the Ombudsman&#39;s office.</p>
<p>&quot;This stalling tactic mirrors that of the student loan bribe, and bears similarity to the decision from Helen Clark&#39;s office at the last election to withhold crucial Corngate documents in the lead-up to the election. &quot;Our information request relates to close to $30 million worth of grants. This is important information for the public and they deserve answers ahead of the election.</p>
<p>&quot;After the National Party&#39;s initial request on July 5, Mr Horomia replied on 28 July saying he wanted an extension of 20 working days to 30 August.</p>
<p>&quot;After a complaint to the Ombudsman we were told yesterday that Mr Horomia&#39;s office confirmed the response was in the office but he wouldn&#39;t be in until next Monday to sign it out.</p>
<p>&quot;We all know that Labour MPs were in Wellington on Monday for a meeting at Premier House - so why isn&#39;t the information on its way already?</p>
<p>&quot;Te Puni Kokiri is still not meeting deadlines set in statute.</p>
<p>&quot; Where is the accountability and transparency for a large chunk of taxpayers money? We simply want to see where the money from the last financial year went.</p>
<p>&quot;The longer they delay, the more suspicious we become,&quot; says Mr Brownlee.</p>
