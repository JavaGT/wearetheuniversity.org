<p>Labour buries number of waiting list dead</p>
<p>Heather Roy<br>Monday, 12 September 2005<br>Press Releases - Health</p>
<p>Labour is hiding the number of people dying on hospital waiting lists by getting rid of the exit category that recorded deaths, ACT Health spokesman Heather Roy said today.</p>
<p>An Otago District Health Board letter confirms that the Ministry of Health has reduced the number of exit categories for hospital waiting lists from ten to four.</p>
<p>The deceased category has been hidden within the category &quot;patient removed due to changed patient circumstances.&quot;</p>
<p>The category includes patients who have died waiting for treatment, patients who have gone private and patients who are classified as unfit for surgery.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just a blatant Labour Government cover-up to hide their waiting list shame.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday ACT held a remembrance day releasing 1,152 balloons - one for each person who died on Labour&#39;s hospital waiting lists in 2004. This is a disgrace.</p>
<p>&quot;The public will now have no way of knowing how many people died while waiting for treatment in 2005,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has spent an extra $3.5 billion a year on health but there are no more health services as a result. Labour has spent the money on health bureaucracy, rather than additional treatment.</p>
<p>ACT would:</p>
<p>- Ring fence $250 million of health funding and require DHB&#39;s to utilise the private health sector to reduce waiting lists from 180,000 to 120,000 in three years.</p>
<p>- Introduce tax assistance so people can better afford health insurance or pay to go privately.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has failed 180,000 people on waiting lists and the thousands more who have died since they came to office,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
