<p>ACT remembers Labour&#39;s waiting list dead</p>
<p>Heather Roy Sunday, 11 September 2005 Press Releases - Health</p>
<p>ACT Health spokesman Heather Roy and ACT leader Rodney Hide today remembered those who have died on Labour&#39;s hospital waiting lists at services throughout the country.</p>
<p>1,152 balloons, one for every New Zealander who died while waiting for treatment last year, were released simultaneously at remembrance services in Auckland, New Plymouth, Wellington and Christchurch.</p>
<p>In New Plymouth, Margaret Webster, whose 15-year-old daughter Angie was one of Labour&#39;s first waiting list victims, released a balloon at her gravesite.</p>
<p>Margaret found Angie dead in her bed on 11 September 2000. An autopsy found she died of a heart drug build-up while waiting for a $5000 operation that would have saved her life.</p>
<p>Mrs Roy and Mr Hide vowed to reduce the number of people dying on the country&#39;s hospital waiting lists by properly utilising private hospitals for publicly funded operations.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT will reduce current waiting list numbers by 25,000 a year by using operating theatres and beds at private hospitals, which are currently lying idle because of Labour&#39;s ideological opposition to harnessing the private sector to reduce waiting lists,&quot; Mr Hide said.</p>
<p>Mrs Roy said 120,000 New Zealanders were currently waiting to see a specialist for the first time and another 60,000 have been told they need surgery and will have to wait months or even years to get it.</p>
<p>&quot;Even worse 1,152 people died on Labour&#39;s hospital waiting lists last year.</p>

<p>&quot;Labour has spent an extra $3.5 billion a year on health, but there are no more health services as a result. Labour has spent the money on health bureaucracy, rather than additional treatment.</p>
<p>ACT would:</p>
<p>- ring fence $250 million of health funding and require DHB&#39;s to utilise the private health sector to reduce waiting lists from 180,000 to 120,000 in three years.</p>
<p>- introduce tax assistance so people can better afford health insurance or pay to go privately.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has failed 180,000 patients on waiting lists and the thousands more who have died since they came to office,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
