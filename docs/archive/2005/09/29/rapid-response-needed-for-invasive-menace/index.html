<p>Rapid response needed for invasive menace</p>
<p>The discovery of the invasive weed didymo in a fourth South Island river needs a quick and thorough response by everyone concerned, Green Party MP Metiria Turei says.</p>
<p>Didymo, also known as rock snot, has been confirmed in the lower Waiau, Mararoa and Buller rivers. Authorities are awaiting test results to determine whether algae found in Otago&#39;s Hawea River is also the destructive weed.</p>
<p>&quot;Didymo is an extremely aggressive invasive algae that can seriously damage the ecology of South Island rivers; looking like mats of soggy toilet paper, it quickly smothers out other plants and threatens fish life,&quot; Ms Turei says.</p>
<p>Restrictions have already been put in place on the lower Waiau and Mararoa rivers and are expected to be placed on the Buller soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly all haste and maximum precaution is what is needed. I understand that as yet there is no effective means of eradication, but I am pleased to see Biosecurity New Zealand, Fish and Game and other river users working together to respond quickly to this threat.</p>
<p>&quot;These groups working together to implement a high level public awareness campaign educating all river users as a matter of urgency is one of the best ways to protect our rivers.</p>
<p>&quot;The more river users who are aware of what needs to be done to contain this serious threat the better,&quot; Mrs Turei says.</p>
<p>&quot;These rivers are of huge economic significance, especially for the tourism industry and as such need to be protected as much as possible.&quot;</p>
