<p>Speaker Wilson&#39;s inaction over Labour propaganda unacceptable</p>
<p>Hon. Ken Shirley<br>Tuesday, 6 September 2005<br>Press Releases - Other</p>
<p>New Zealanders should be outraged by Labour&#39;s continued abuse of parliamentary support funding for electioneering purposes, says ACT MP Ken Shirley.</p>
<p>&quot;The large red spreadsheet promoting Labour has been posted to all households countrywide. This material contains the parliamentary crest and Helen Clark has admitted that it has been paid for by parliamentary support funds.</p>
<p>&quot;The production and posting of item alone would amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers&#39; money.</p>
<p>&quot;Parliamentary rules are very clear. Parliamentary budgets cannot be used for distributing promotional or electioneering material. These rules are determined and should be enforced by the Speaker.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that time and time again Speaker Margaret Wilson has either been bullied into submission by Helen Clark or, alternatively, she is willingly complicit in this rort. Either scenario is totally unacceptable but emphasises the extremely partisan behaviour that she has brought to the office of Speaker.</p>
<p>&quot;I am referring this specific publication to the Auditor-General in the hope that his office will have the courage to condemn this sham and the disgraceful misuse of taxpayers&#39; funds,&quot; Mr Shirley said.</p>
