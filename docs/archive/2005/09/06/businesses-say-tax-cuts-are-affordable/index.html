<p>John Key MP<br>National Party Finance Spokesman</p>

<p>Businesses say tax cuts are affordable</p>
<p>“Michael Cullen continues to be in a club of one with his claim that National’s plan to cut taxes, improve incentives and reward extra effort is unaffordable,” says National Party Finance spokesman John Key.</p>
<p>“The business community has clearly seen the long-term benefits of our plan and they‘re saying so in this morning’s Mood of the Boardroom survey.”</p>
<p>The survey, published in this morning’s New Zealand Herald, says 86% of CEOs believe Michael Cullen is guilty of an about-face with his spending commitments this election.</p>
<p>“If Dr Cullen released the full costings of his student loans policy we would be able to see just how irresponsible he’s been,” says Mr Key.</p>
<p>In the survey, 45% said Labour had made ‘poor’ spending decisions and a further 37% thought Labour had made only ‘average’ spending decisions.</p>
<p>“More than 90% of those surveyed are backing National’s tax plan. Labour’s targeted welfare has been roundly rejected.</p>
<p>“Business leaders are also concerned at the prospect of a Green/Labour Government, with 57% saying that would be the worst coalition combination for business.</p>
<p>“National has a plan to lift living standards and provide quality healthcare and education for all New Zealanders,” says Mr Key.</p>
