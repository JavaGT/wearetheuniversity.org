<p>Students Must Be Told If Fee Hikes Are Back In Fashion</p>
<p>Massey University Student Association President Iain Galloway is calling on all political parties to be honest about their policy regarding Tertiary Institution fee setting. Following the decision by the Massey University Council to seek a ten percent increase in tuition fees for 2006, Mr Galloway says that students and the public have the right to know if the massive annual fee hikes of the 90’s are coming back into fashion.</p>
<p>“Whilst the main political parties opened their campaigns promising laudable adjustments to the student loan scheme, the menace of rocketing fees appears to be a case of giving with one hand and taking away with the other,” said Mr Galloway. “Tax rebates and interest free loans will be of little relief to students with enough debt to buy their first home.”</p>
<p>Government funding of tertiary institutions has gradually been eroded in real terms to the point where students now cover thirty-five percent of tertiary education costs, a full ten percent more than what was envisioned in the Todd report.</p>
<p>Mr Galloway said that “some parties, such as the Progressives and Greens have been explicit about increasing funds for institutions and about capping fees. Others, such as Labour and New Zealand First have made non-specific references to restraining fees and National and Act have made no reference at all to fee caps or increased funding. Students need to know for sure what policies they will be voting for this election. I think it is time everyone came clean on this issue.”</p>
