<p>John Key MP National Party Finance Spokesman</p>
<p>06 September 2005</p>
<p>Show us the papers!</p>
<p>National Party Finance spokesman John Key says Michael Cullen is still refusing to release the full Treasury costings for Labour&#39;s student loan election pledge.</p>
<p>&quot;What is Dr Cullen trying to hide?</p>
<p>&quot;National has made a legitimate request for the full Treasury costings of Labour&#39;s loan scheme, but Dr Cullen is stone-walling our efforts.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Key is referring to an Official Information request where Dr Cullen confirms he asked Treasury &#39;to cost a range of interest free student loans scenarios&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Finance Minister has only provided the slimmest of outlines, and has still failed to produce any of the written material that would normally accompany such a significant policy.</p>
<p>&quot;National is to take up Dr Cullen&#39;s decision to withhold the advice with the Ombudsman, but we are urging Labour to put that information on the table before they are forced to do so.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is clearly stalling for time. The student loan policy is an irresponsible policy that encourages students to borrow the maximum and repay the minimum.</p>
<p>&quot;Even the flimsy costings Dr Cullen has released don&#39;t reflect Helen Clark&#39;s claim that the policy would cost as little as $100 million. Treasury says it&#39;ll cost $170 million in the first instance, that&#39;s $70 million more than suggested by the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>&quot;Independent assessment of the scheme has confirmed the risk to our economy, and there have been suggestions it will lead to a $1.7 billion write-down on the balance sheet,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
<p>&quot;If Labour has nothing to hide, why are they so cagey about releasing the papers?&quot;</p>
