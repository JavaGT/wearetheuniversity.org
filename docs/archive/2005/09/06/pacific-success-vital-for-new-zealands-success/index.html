<p><strong>Tuesday, 6 September 2005, 11:21 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>5th August 2005</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s Vision: Pacific Success Vital For New Zealand&#39;s Success</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s vision of Pacific people is a strong endorsement of the significant contribution that Pacific people have contributed to New Zealand society. Labour&#39;s Pacific policy, revealed that the success of the Pacific people is vital for New Zealand&#39;s future success, says Manukau City Councillor &amp; Labour party list candidate Su&#39;a William Sio.</p>
<p>The journeys of the Pacific people have seen them:-</p>
<p>* Migrate to New Zealand from the islands to provide the much needed labour force the manufacturing industries of 1960s &amp; 1970s needed;</p>
<p>* Weather the humiliation of Muldoon&#39;s dawn raid tactics in 1970s/80s;</p>
<p>* Survive the loss of high wages &amp; beneficial working conditions under Nationals 1990 Employment Contracts Act;</p>
<p>* And have now become colourful personalities &amp; iconic features in the fabric of New Zealand&#39;s Music, Sports &amp; Creative industry.</p>
<p>Su&#39;a says that Helen Clarks Labour government has in the past six years provided so much support to strengthening the growth and development of Pacific communities that &quot;I have never been so proud to be a Pacific person in New Zealand than I am now, and that goes for the rest of the Pacific communities in New Zealand. Pacific people are an integral part of New Zealand society today and we are here to stay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The names of the Terminator David Tua, Inga the Winger Tuigamala, Ice-Man Michael Jones, Jonah Lomu, Queen B-Beatrice Faumuina, and Tana Umaga the captain of the All Blacks, are Pacific people who have become household names throughout New Zealand for their prowess in sports&quot;, says Su&#39;a.</p>

<p>&quot;And there are many more who follow their footsteps.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In music, we have Pacific talents like Scribe, Che Fu, Adeaze, Dawn Raids, Nesian Mystic, Ben Makisi, Jonathan Lemalu, Ardijah to name just a few. They are not only winning Tui Awards but are making a huge impact in the international music scene. And this is only the beginning&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the Creative industry, names such as painter Fatu Feuu, dance company Black Grace, and the comedy acts of the Naked and Laughing Samoans, and Bro Town are all beginning to make significant contributions in their respective fields.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The success of these Pacific icons have contributed to raising the profile of New Zealand as a nation of talented and innovative people, and a nation of thriving cultures throughout the international community.&quot;</p>
<p>Su&#39;a says that there is still much more work to be done and Labour will continue to provide support in key areas like housing, health and education.</p>
<p>* Labour will continue to focus on developing education and skills. We will promote the attainment of higher qualifications for Pacific school-leavers and address obstacles that impede their success. We will also encourage more Pacific peoples into Modern Apprenticeships and Industry training by promoting awareness, access, and support for those considering apprenticeships.</p>
<p>* Education is the gateway to better qualifications, better jobs, and higher incomes. Higher incomes mean better housing, improved health, and more security in old age. Education is the key which unlocks all this. Labour will do all it can to encourage young Pacific people to enrol in tertiary education.</p>
<p>* Labour will also continue to promote Pacific language and culture through supporting Pacific early childhood education centers, the development of Pacifica curricula in schools, and the promotion of Pacifica language and culture through the arts and broadcasting, such as Niu FM.</p>
<p>* Labour believes strongly that a healthy people are vital for a healthy economy.</p>
<p>* &quot;Labour will continue to promote early intervention by helping Pacific peoples access health services when they need to; addressing financial constraints, and monitoring the new primary health care package to ensure that it is effectively meeting Pacific needs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The exciting new areas which this government will look to increasing Pacific participation in are the areas of skill development, managerial skills, and business development. These are exciting areas because these areas are seen by many as the final frontier in Pacific development. Increasing participation in senior management levels &amp; increasing people in business will accelerate the work for Pacific communities to fully realize their full potential.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Over the next 20 years, the Pacific and Maori population will become a significant number of New Zealand&#39;s workforce, and we will play a vital part in helping to support the older generations of New Zealand&quot;, says Su&#39;a.</p>
