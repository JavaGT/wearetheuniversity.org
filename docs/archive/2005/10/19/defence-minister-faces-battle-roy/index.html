<p>Defence Minister Faces Battle - Roy</p>
<p>Heather Roy Wednesday, 19 October 2005 Press Releases - Defence</p>
<p>&quot;Incoming Defence Minister Phil Goff faces a battle to represent the armed forces in Cabinet&quot;, said Heather Roy, ACT&#39;s Defence spokesman, today.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders take our role as international citizens seriously. Unfortunately, successive Governments haven&#39;t.</p>
<p>&quot;The outgoing Minister watched our forces decline. The findings of the Defence Capability and Resourcing Review, reported two days ago, showed a shortage of 2500 defence personnel.</p>
<p>In August, Mr Goff told Australian Defence College personnel that &quot;we sustain military forces as combat ready&quot;, but in reality we have to scavenge from our allies before any significant deployment, Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that Mr Goff will ensure that our armed forces get the political and financial support they need.</p>
<p>&quot;Our defence force needs the capability to deploy into the world&#39;s trouble spots as an independent force, as well as alongside other countries.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT is committed to a strong, balanced defence force, comprising both regular and reserve forces. A coherant approach to national security across Minstries is required, alongside increases in effective funding and the development of both traditional and new alliances&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
