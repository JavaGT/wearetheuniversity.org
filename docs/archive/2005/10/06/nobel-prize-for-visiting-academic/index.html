<p>Nobel Prize for visiting academic</p>
<p>For the second time in two years an academic visiting the University of Canterbury has been awarded a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm announced overnight that leading organic chemist and current Erskine Fellow, Bob Grubbs, has been awarded the 2005 Nobel Prize in chemistry.</p>
<p>In October 2003 Emeritus Professor Clive Granger was visiting Canterbury when he received the phone call from Sweden telling him he was joint winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics.</p>
<p>Professor Grubbs and this year&#39;s other two winners were cited specifically for the development of the metathesis method in organic synthesis.</p>
<p>Metathesis is an organic reaction in which chemists selectively strip out certain atoms in a compound and replace them with atoms that were previously part of another compound. The end result is a custom-built molecule that has specialised properties, such as better drugs for the treatment of disease or better electrical conducting properties for specialised plastics.</p>
<p>According to the Nobel citation, metathesis has already led to industrial and pharmaceutical methods that are more efficient and less wasteful, simpler, and more environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>&quot;This represents a great step forward for &#39;green chemistry,&#39; reducing potentially hazardous waste through smarter production,&quot; the Royal Swedish Academy said.</p>
<p>&quot;Metathesis is an example of how important basic science has been applied for the benefit of man, society, and the environment.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Grubbs is visiting Canterbury University as an Erskine Fellow from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).</p>
<p>He says he is especially pleased that the Nobel committee has recognised research that has taken place at Caltech.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m excited for all the outstanding students and postdoctoral fellows who have contributed to this work over the years.&quot;</p>
