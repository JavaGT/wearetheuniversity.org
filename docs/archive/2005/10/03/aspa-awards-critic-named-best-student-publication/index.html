<p><strong>Monday, 3 October 2005, 10:36 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Aotearoa_Student_Press_Association">Aotearoa Student Press Association</a></strong></p>
<h3>Critic named Best Student Publication In ASPA Awards</h3>
<p>Critic, the much-talked about Otago University student magazine, was named the best publication by a panel of media experts at the annual Aotearoa Student Press Association awards, held in Auckland on Saturday in association with the NZ Listener.</p>
<p>Critic scooped seven of the 16 awards on offer, including best designed publication, ‘best news writer (paid)’ (Kate Newton) and ‘best editorial writer’ for editor Holly Walker.</p>
<p>Feature writer and columnist Steve Braunias said Critic was “Solid, entertaining, provocative, sometimes properly stupid, and, possibly, vital to Dunedin… [with] lots of humour and a clear editorial intelligence at work.”</p>
<p>Media commentator Russell Brown said “&quot;Critic has had a banner year - the issues submitted were strong from beginning to end. While it does the basics well - the pages look good and the copy is well-edited - Critic also shows a distinctive editorial imagination.&quot;</p>
<p>Auckland University of Technology’s Debate was named best small publication.</p>
<p>Other winners on the night included Craccum co-editor Alec Hutchinson, who won the categories of ‘best columnist’ and ‘best features writer’. Listener feature writer Alistair Bone said that Alec’s writing was “on a different level”.</p>
<p>The Aotearoa Student Press Association comprises 13 publications from the country’s university and polytechnic campuses. These are the fourth annual awards, and the second held in association with the Listener.</p>
<p>One of the winners will be chosen by the Listener to take a two week internship at the magazine. All winners receive a subscription to the Listener.</p>
