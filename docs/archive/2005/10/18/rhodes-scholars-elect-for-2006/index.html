<p>Nicholas Douglas, Rosara Joseph and Malcolm Birdling have been selected as Rhodes Scholars following a recent selection meeting at Government House in Wellington.</p>
<p>Tenable at Oxford University, Rhodes Scholarships constitute the pinnacle of achievement for university graduates wishing to pursue postgraduate study at one of the world’s leading universities. In this country, the awards are administered by the NZ Vice-Chancellors’ Committee.</p>
<p>Nicholas Douglas is a University of Otago graduate who has completed a Bachelor of Medical Science degree with First Class Honours and is currently a fifth-year medical student.

In his early teens, Nicholas represented Canterbury in badminton and hockey. Music is a big part of Nicholas’ life; he has been a member of the NZ Secondary Schools’ Choir, the Tower New Zealand Youth Choir and more recently the University of Otago Capping Sextet and Cantores (Christchurch Chamber Choir).</p>
<p>At Oxford, he intends undertaking a Master of Global Health Science and then to read for a Doctor of Philosophy. Nicholas plans to return to this country to work as a paediatric oncologist.</p>
