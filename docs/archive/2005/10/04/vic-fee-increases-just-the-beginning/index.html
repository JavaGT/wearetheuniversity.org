<p>Bill English - National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>4 October 2005</p>
<p>Vic fee increases just the beginning</p>
<p>Students at tertiary education institutions throughout the country should expect substantial fee increases as a result of Labour&#39;s student loan policy, says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;Treasury officials have suggested that Labour&#39;s policy of removing interest on student loans could lead to other policy &#39;adjustments&#39;, including &#39;restrictions on access to tertiary education&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;During the election campaign Labour told students that fees would be kept down by their fee maxima policy. In fact, that policy allows for significant fee increases and exemptions.</p>
<p>&quot;Victoria University&#39;s alleged plans to increase fees are an inevitable consequence of Labour&#39;s policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s student loan policy is an extremely large fiscal commitment and will inevitably lead to increases in other costs associated with tertiary education.</p>
<p>&quot;Students would be right to ask themselves what good an interest free loan is when they have to borrow increasingly more for ever-growing fees,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
