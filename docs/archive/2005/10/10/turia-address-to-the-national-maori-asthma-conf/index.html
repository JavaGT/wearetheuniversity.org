<p>“Treasuring the ‘ha’ in Hauora’</p>
<p>Tena koutou, o Ngapuhi, o te Tai Tokerau, o nga mata waka kua tai mai i tenei ra.</p>
<p>Ti hei mauri ora.<br>Patai mai he aha te mea nui o te ao<br>Ka whakahoki au<br>He tangata, he tangata, he tangata.<br>Ti hei mauri ora.</p>
<p>It is a great honour to be here today at the National Maori Asthma Conference. And I must commend the conference organisers - seldom have I received a request to speak at a conference a whole year in advance!</p>
<p>The breath of life is a concept which has everlasting meaning in our world.</p>
<p>From the first twitch in Te Kore which gave life;</p>
<p>flowing through the sacred waters of creation;</p>
<p>to the life force instilled within the human element;</p>
<p>we are always aware of the need to preserve and protect the source of breath.</p>
<p>This is never so apparent as within the area that draws us here today. The issue of respiratory health and well-being.</p>
<p>The programme is enough to take one’s breath away.</p>
<p>The quality of speakers spanning from specialist areas of COPD, bronchiectasis, tikanga Maori, and spirometry is most impressive and will provide a rich foundation for nurturing Maori health and asthma management.</p>
<p>So what should I talk about?</p>
<p>Believe me - this is a question I’ve never encountered as much as I have in the last 23 days.</p>
<p>I’ve never been kissed and hongied and hugged as much as I have these last few weeks.</p>
<p>Everywhere I go the microphones been offered, the phone’s perpetually ringing, the media on high alert.</p>

<p>Will you talk on the Don and Gerry show?</p>
<p>How are your talks going with Helen and Heather?</p>
<p>Are you talking with the Greens?</p>
<p>Could you ever talk to Winston?</p>
<p>Are you done with Dunne? Will you act with ACT? And so it goes on.</p>
<p>Well I thought I’d disclose all today - and share the secret of my success.</p>
<p>My success in managing to stay calm, to breathe deep, and to take stock. My success in managing my asthma.</p>
<p>When I was 46 years old, working in the Head Office of Mäori Affairs, in a job that was intensely stressful, I suddenly became ill.</p>
<p>Within the space of a weekend my life and my future changed dramatically as I was diagnosed an asthmatic.</p>
<p>I read up on my life prognosis. It didn’t look good.</p>
<p>I found that Maori experience great asthma morbidity, and that hospitalisation and mortality rates for Maori exceeded those of non-Maori. Although we have similar rates of asthma prevalence, once we get it, like most health conditions, our attacks are more severe, our outcomes more adverse.</p>
<p>Over the next twelve years I never went anywhere without my blue, orange, brown inhalers in my bag - and if they weren’t - panic would set in.</p>
<p>Every now and then I’d be under the nebuliser, waiting for the vapours to do their magic, and trying to be a good patient.</p>
<p>I was pathologically focused on removing the triggers and would always blame the cat hair on the couch, heavily perfumed guests, the air-conditioning in the office, for aggravating my asthma.</p>
<p>Occasionally I’d be on a course of prednisone as the attacks became more severe.</p>
<p>One day it all changed.</p>
<p>I picked up the paper and saw an ad for the Buteyko method. Just a little ad in the classifieds. $480 for a four day course. Couldn’t hurt I thought.</p>
<p>Over the duration of the course I learnt how to breathe slowly but shallowly.</p>
<p>I learnt about different exercises I could do if I was having an attack - or the routines I could follow to take preventive care of my health.</p>
<p>More than anything I developed confidence in myself. Confidence in my ability to manage asthma without drugs.</p>
<p>It completely changed my attitude to asthma. I was no longer fixated on my peak flow - my focus shifted to managing my breathing, to following my exercises, to taking care of my health.</p>
<p>Then eighteen months later I left Labour.</p>
<p>I tell you - I can thoroughly recommend it!</p>
<p>The rest is history. Indeed as we all know we have made history in the arrival of a strong and independent Maori voice in Parliament.</p>
<p>That voice - in my case anyway - has been asthma free and proud.</p>
<p>One day I woke up and realised that without even knowing I hadn’t had asthma for three months. In fact since I left Labour, I have only ever had to take medication when I have had a cold - but in the main I am asthma free, and it feels great.</p>
<p>My story is not sponsored by Buteyko - or indeed designed to influence your vote - although neither would be such a bad thing!</p>
<p>Why I wanted to share the secret of my success is really just to remind us, that we can all have rangatiratanga over our health - and the health of our whanau.</p>
<p>I hope that the discipline of watching out for, and taking care of my health can provide my mokopuna with other models for managing their asthma. I have encouraged my children to work with the breathing exercises, to have the confidence to face the future without reliance on medication.</p>
<p>I believe we can all recognise and demonstrate our own authority, our own special knowledge of how best to preserve our sacred breath.</p>
<p>Twenty-three days ago we all held our breath, and took the risk of voting for ourselves, of looking to our own models for confidence.</p>
<p>And although I know you’re all sick of election talk there are just two things I want to really congratulate ourselves on:</p>
<p> Firstly that 30,000 more Maori turned up to vote in these elections than in 2002;</p>
<p> And secondly, that the actual turnout of Maori who went to the polls has increased from 56% in 2002, to 67% this year. Of course there’s still huge room for improvement - and you’ve heard it first - that’s the focus for the next campaign….</p>
<p>We can all take the steps towards self-determination.</p>
<p>You’ll be aware of the Chinese proverb, A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.</p>
<p>I believe that in ridding myself of reliance on ventolin and all its friends, I have taken the critical first step in my pathway to future health and well-being.</p>
<p>Over the next few days here at Terenga Paraoa, I hope there are also many other first steps made in our journey to restoring ourselves to our fullest potential.</p>
<p>The workshops, the key speakers, the opportunity for you all to walk the talk together is a wonderful opportunity to look anew at the challenges that face us not just in asthma management but in Maori health and wellbeing in general.</p>
<p>The time has never been better than now. The world is ours - we must establish horizons in sight which ensure our credibility is enhanced; our integrity is beyond doubt, and our own mana motuhake is affirmed.</p>
<p>It is up to us all to plot out our future direction, to ensure we can all advance a strong and independent Maori voice.</p>
<p>Kia kaha koutou ki te whai o koutou moemoea, mau ki to tino rangatiratanga. Kia kaha koutou, ki te tu, kia kaha, kia kaha.</p>
