<p>It&#39;s The Same Old Story</p>
<p>New Zealand First says that despite all the hype, rhetoric and money directed at ‘closing the gaps’ between Maori and non-Maori, the depressing reality is that Maori are still languishing at the bottom of the heap, as shown in a new report.</p>
<p>“The Labour Government has repeated ad nauseum over the last six years how much in the way of resources, policy and funding has been directed at improving the status of Maori,” said Maori Affairs spokesperson Pita Paraone.</p>
<p>“What I want to know is, when are we going to start seeing some positive results?</p>
<p>“The latest Health Needs Assessment Report, prepared by the Waikato District Health Board, sadly repeats the same old story.</p>
<p>“We all know how it goes: at all educational, occupational and income levels, Maori have poorer health status than non-Maori. Maori are also more likely to live in sub-standard housing and to live in poverty, factors which contribute to their poor health.</p>
<p>“The present approach is obviously not working. We need to work smarter to find a way to beat this, because until we do, we’re all losers.</p>
<p>“I challenge the Government to be the innovative, solution-based outfit that it keeps saying it is, and come up with some solutions that work for all New Zealanders, not just the educated, middle class urban dwellers that vote Labour,” said Mr Paraone.</p>
