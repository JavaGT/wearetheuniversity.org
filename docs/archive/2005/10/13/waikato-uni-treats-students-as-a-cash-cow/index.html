<p>Waikato Uni is treating its students like a cash cow</p>
<p>The University of Waikato is treating its students and their loan accounts as a cash cow with its decision to increase fees for the third year in a row, Green Education Spokesperson Metiria Turei says.</p>
<p>The University&#39;s council voted yesterday for an average three-and-a-half percent increase next year in domestic student fees, with some courses rising by as much as five percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Waikato University&#39;s decision to increase its fees again shows that it has no concern for the increasing costs and debt burden borne by its students,&quot; Mrs Turei says.</p>
<p>&quot;This certainly looks like an example of a University using the fee maxima system and student fees to suck money out of the student loan scheme for monument building. This is a shell game between the Universities and the Government, with students ultimately picking up the tab.</p>
<p>&quot;The University recently sacked staff and decided to invest in $30 million for a &#39;super campus&#39; that will be paid for by increasing students&#39; fees. Clearly flash new offices are the priority and the actual human beings seeking and providing an education in its lecture theatres are the lowest priority for the University.</p>
<p>&quot;These actions demonstrate the failure of the fee maxima policy, which was supposed to control the ever-increasing cost of a university education. Without strict limits on fees, as the Greens have continually advocated, students remain vulnerable to Universities&#39; desire to maximise their income.</p>
<p>&quot;This also highlights the urgent need for the Government to both restrict fee increases more effectively and enable wider access to student allowances,&quot; Mrs Turei says.</p>
