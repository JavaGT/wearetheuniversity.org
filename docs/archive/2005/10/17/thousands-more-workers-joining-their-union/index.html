<p><strong>Monday, 17 October 2005, 8:34 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions">New Zealand Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p>Thousands more workers joining their union</p>
<p>“Over 12,000 more workers have recognised the importance of joining together in unions,” said Carol Beaumont, Secretary of the Council of Trade Unions.</p>
<p>The latest figures from the Industrial Relations Centre at Victoria University of Wellington, released today, show an increase of 12,427 more union members (up 3.4% from 2003) and that since 1999 NZ unions have grown in membership by 17% - an increase of 51,643 members.</p>
<p>“This is great news on the eve of the CTU Biennial Conference” said Carol Beaumont, CTU Secretary. “Our conference theme is Unions 2010 – and these figures show the union movement has a good platform to build on.”</p>
<p>“Workers will be building on successes like the 5% in 05 campaign as we continue to challenge low pay in NZ,” said Carol Beaumont.</p>
<p>“The NZ union movement has a wide agenda and we will continue to promote economic and social development that creates quality work for all New Zealanders, a real say for workers at all levels of society and public services that are high quality and accessible,” said Carol Beaumont.</p>
