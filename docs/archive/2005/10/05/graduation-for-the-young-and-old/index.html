<p>Neil Kirton receives an honorary Master of Engineering at last weeks Faculty of Engineering&#39;s graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>*************</p>
<p>The University of Auckland&#39;s graduation ceremony last week was not just a special occasion for young graduates, it was also a chance for the Faculty of Engineering to honour two of its own.</p>
<p>Peter Menzies was awarded a University of Auckland fellowship and Neil Kirton an honorary Master of Engineering for their unique and valuable contributions to the Faculty and University.</p>
<p>&quot;Peter and Neil are both deserving recipients of their awards for the tireless effort and significant contribution that they have made over the years,&quot; says Dean of Engineering Professor Peter Brothers.</p>
<p>Peter&#39;s background as an engineer, combined with his business experience, made him an ideal appointment to the Board of Directors of UniServices in 1996 and then Chair in 1999.</p>
<p>Auckland UniServices Ltd, the University&#39;s commercial arm, secures and develops contracts for university research in partnership with business, government and community - something Peter has played a prominent role in, Professor Brothers said.</p>
<p>Neil, who has worked for the Faculty for over 40 years, has filled the roles of technician, personal assistant, administrative officer, paymaster and purchase officer.</p>

<p>&quot;The work that he has undertaken has been invaluable. His commitment and ability to provide innovative solutions, see projects through to fruition, and enthuse both staff and students made him a key figure in the growth and development of the Faculty in its early years,&quot; says the Dean.</p>
<p>An extremely popular and well-respected member of staff, Neil has previously been made a Distinguished Fellow of the Auckland University Engineers Association (AUEA), which reserves its honorary awards for those of the greatest distinction. He is the only non graduate ever to be awarded this honour.</p>
