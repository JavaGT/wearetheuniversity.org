<p>Katherine Rich MP National Party ACC Spokeswoman</p>
<p>23 October 2005</p>
<p>Lunacy that pregnancy a &#39;personal injury accident&#39;</p>
<p>ACC costs will skyrocket and credibility of the scheme will plummet if unwanted pregnancy is compensated for as a &#39;personal injury accident&#39;, says National&#39;s ACC spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>She is commenting on reports that a woman who became pregnant after having her tubes tied has won the right to claim ACC compensation based on the argument that her pregnancy was a &#39;personal injury accident&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;If this claim is successful the ramifications for ACC are huge. It potentially opens the floodgates for claims as a result of all other failed contraceptive measures,&quot; says Mrs Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;If this claim is successful the law will have to change to redefine personal injury. It was never the intention of the law. Clearly, the founders of New Zealand&#39;s ACC system in 1972 never envisaged that one day it could be used to compensate unplanned pregnancy.</p>
<p>&quot;This case is sad on so many levels. It shows how far New Zealand has left its pioneering independence behind, that some people really think the birth of a baby could be deemed an injury. It&#39;s sad for the child who will eventually know he was a &#39;personal injury accident&#39; that needed compensation. It&#39;s also sad for the thousands of New Zealanders battling infertility.</p>
<p>&quot;While ACC and the Minister seem to be treating this case as a long shot, they need to tell ACC levy-paying kiwis what they intend to do about this situation,&quot; says Mrs Rich.</p>
