<p><strong>Monday, 31 October 2005, 8:53 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour relegates major roading projects for coalition agreement</p>
<p>National&#39;s Associate Transport spokesman, David Bennett, says Labour has relegated essential roading plans in Auckland and the Waikato to hold on to power.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s post-election dealings with Winston Peters led to promises of increased funding for roading projects in Tauranga. This means that the proportionality of the Auckland roading package must surely be compromised,&quot; says Mr Bennett.</p>
<p>&quot;It also means that the soon to be completed Waikato package needs to be increased to maintain a balanced roading package.&quot;</p>
<p>The Joint Official&#39;s Group (JOG) process provides funding increases for areas deemed to have the most acute roading needs – including Auckland, Wellington, Tauranga and the Waikato.</p>
<p>&quot;The JOG process has been compromised by Labour, leaving a question mark hanging over roading projects which are essential to economic growth,&quot; says Mr Bennett.</p>
<p>&quot;If Labour was serious about keeping the country moving forward, then it wouldn&#39;t have relegated our most acute roading needs in Auckland and the Waikato in the pursuit of power.&quot;</p>
