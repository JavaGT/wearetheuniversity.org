<p>Students being punished for university&#39;s failures</p>
<p>It is unfair that students are to suffer the consequences of Canterbury University&#39;s failure to secure more adequate Government funding, Green Party Education Spokesperson Metiria Turei says.</p>
<p>The university has announced that it plans to increase student fees by 5 percent next year saying it needs to in order to maintain quality education.</p>
<p>&quot;Milking students for more and more is a futile shell game that will do nothing for a quality education. It is a growing trend for universities to punish their students for failure to secure adequate funding from the Government.</p>
<p>&quot;I am disappointed that the university has ignored the students&#39; association&#39;s attempted to negotiate a lower increase.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear that the students understood the constraints on the university and were prepared to do their bit.</p>
<p>&quot;But the university&#39;s refusal to accept that compromise showed that Canterbury has also been infected with the increasing contempt for students that is prevalent among many<br>universities,&quot; Mrs Turei says.</p>
