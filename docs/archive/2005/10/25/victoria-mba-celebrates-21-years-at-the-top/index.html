<p>Victoria MBA celebrates 21 years at the top</p>
<p>Victoria University is celebrating the 21st birthday of its Master of Business Administration programme with a free public forum at the University’s Pipitea Campus this week.</p>
<p>The forum, The Value of an MBA in 21st Century New Zealand, will be held at 12 noon on Friday 28 October in Lecture Theatre 1, Old Government Buildings, Pipitea Campus, Lambton Quay.</p>
<p>Speakers at the forum include: Associate Professor Brent Allred, a visiting American academic and MBA lecturer; Roger Kerr, Chief Executive of New Zealand Business Roundtable; Geoff Thorn, General Manager of the New Zealand Commerce Commission; and Chris White, from The Treasury and a Victoria MBA alumnus.</p>
<p>Dr Paul McDonald, Director of the MBA Programme in the Victoria Management School, said reaching 21 years affirmed the quality of a Victoria MBA.</p>
<p>“This is a landmark year for us as we’ve been in existence for 21 years. Uniquely situated in the University’s Pipitea Campus in downtown Wellington, the Victoria Management School is able to bring together the best of public and private enterprise. The programme provides both a strong national and international context to the sharing and exchange of business thinking and knowledge. Gaining a Victoria MBA is a challenge, but a challenge that is worth the hard work involved.</p>
<p>“The Victoria Management School was ranked as the top School of its kind in the country in the Government’s Performance-Based Research Fund exercise. That mark of quality flows through into our teaching and our graduates are of the highest calibre and hold leadership positions in both the public and private sectors.”</p>
