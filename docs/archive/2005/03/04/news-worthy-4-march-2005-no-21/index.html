<p>News Worthy - 4 March 2005 - No. 21</p>

<p><strong>Hotel Rwanda</strong></p>
<p>At the end of January I returned from climbing Kilimanjaro which is close to Arusha in Tanzania. There I met up with Jonathan Moses a New Zealand lawyer who is a senior trial attorney at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The Tribunal, which was set up by United Nations resolutions, prosecutes persons responsible for genocide committed in Rwanda in 1994. The maximum penalty which the Tribunal can impose is life imprisonment without parole. A number of trials have occurred to date.</p>
<p>A former Prime Minister J. Kambanda pleaded guilty with the hope of a lesser sentence. He was unsuccessful. One of the trials in progress involves a Roman Catholic Priest called A. Seromba who padlocked his church with 2,000 parishioners inside and then bulldozed the church to the ground. All of the parishioners died.</p>
<p>Now a film which is screening in New Zealand Hotel Rwanda provides a graphic picture of the horror of that period. It is based on a true life story and is a chilling reminder of mans inhumanity to man.</p>
<p><strong>Cross- dressing in the classroom</strong></p>
<p>The Gender Identity Bill remorselessly advances the social engineering programme of the Government. Political correctness remains the order of the day.</p>
<p>The Bill proposes to outlaw discrimination against cross-dressing and transvestite activity. It has passed the scrutiny of the Labour Caucus and been drawn from the Members Ballot.</p>

<p>If it passes, cross dressing in the military, prison service and in the classroom will be possible.</p>
<p><strong>Labour wipes $40 million in fines</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand courts wiped $40 million in fines last year, with eight offenders getting off fines of more than $70,000 each.</p>
<p>The Courts Department figures show that the $40 million in wiped fines compared with $35 million in 2003, and $26 million in 1999. That represents a 54% increase in wiped fines since Labour was first elected.</p>
<p>One way of ensuring the fines are paid has been suggested by the Victorian Municipal Association. Car owners would have to pay outstanding fines before being able to re-register their cars.</p>
<p>The only problem with making car owners pay up before being able to register their cars is that they might not have been driving them at the time of an offence being committed.</p>
<p>But it is then up to them to find the offender and they have a cash incentive to do so.</p>
<p>Traffic Offence notices Latest figures show that Police officers issued 400,000 tickets last year compared with 137,000 in 2000.</p>
<p><strong>Revamp of National Party website</strong></p>
<p>The National Party website has been substantially changed and updated - go to <a href="http://www.national.org.nz">http://www.national.org.nz</a>. One feature allows volunteers to log in and indicate the area in which they would like to assist. An email notice is then sent to the electorate concerned and the volunteers are contacted.</p>
<p><strong>Political Quote of the Week</strong> <em>&quot;No man is above the law and no man is below it; nor do we ask any man&#39;s permission when we require him to obey it. Obedience to the law is demanded as a right; not asked as a favour&quot; President Theodore Roosevelt June 1903</em></p>
