<p>Greens support &quot;Don&#39;t Hate, Celebrate&quot; event</p>
<p>The Greens are supporting an event tomorrow aimed at celebrating New Zealand&#39;s diversity and countering the mean-spirited, bigoted message of the Destiny Church.</p>
<p>An event entitled &quot;Don&#39;t Hate, Celebrate&quot; is being held in the Auckland University Quad tomorrow in response to Destiny&#39;s planned &quot;Defend the Legacy&quot; march.</p>
<p>&quot;We support diversity and the right of all parents and children to be treated with respect by the state and fellow citizens, regardless of the type of family they live in,&quot; Green Social Services Spokesperson Sue Bradford said.</p>
<p>&quot;Like many New Zealanders, I&#39;m deeply concerned by some aspects of the message being spread by the Destiny Church and its political offshoots. The hostility and put-downs they direct at homosexual New Zealanders, prostitutes, and solo parents are a concerning development for this country&#39;s political climate.</p>
<p>&quot;Destiny&#39;s rhetoric, and the behaviour at its demonstrations, suggest that it wishes to denigrate any families that don&#39;t meet an outdated Old Testament ideal that is irrelevant to a modern, 21st Century Aotearoa. &#39;Don&#39;t Hate, Celebrate&#39; aims to counter Destiny&#39;s divisive message with an event of celebration and hope.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Bradford said she fully acknowledged the right of Destiny&#39;s members to hold their beliefs.</p>
<p>&quot;But I think it&#39;s dangerous to bring prejudice so squarely into political debate, and to evangelise the values of discrimination and hatred to New Zealanders.</p>

<p>&quot;These values need to be countered with a celebration of humanity, in all its diversity.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greens have been the only party to vote, as a party, for the three recent legislative measures which seek to protect discriminated-against and vulnerable minorities.</p>
<p>&quot;We have proudly supported the Civil Union Bill, the Prostitution Reform Bill, and the Gender Identity Bill. We likewise support the message of this event: that all New Zealanders - no matter their sexuality, gender, race, religious belief, relationship or family status - should be treated with respect.&quot;</p>
