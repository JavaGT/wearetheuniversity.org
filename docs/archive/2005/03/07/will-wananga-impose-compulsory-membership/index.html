<p>Labour to blame if Wananga imposes compulsory student membership<br>5th March</p>
<p>Labour will be responsible if compulsory student association membership is imposed on all Te Wananga o Aotearoa (TWA) students, a move which could unnecessarily add millions of dollars each year to TWA students&#39; costs, Student Choice spokesman Glenn Peoples said today.</p>
<p>A meeting held in September last year proposed establishing a student association at TWA. Under legislation passed by Labour in 2000 all students will be forced to join the association if supporters organise a petition signed by ten percent of students and then win a vote on membership. The law does not specify a minimum level of turnout in the vote, so a handful of students can vote for compulsory membership and have it imposed on all 50,000 TWA students who then have to pay whatever levy the association sets.</p>
<p>The average cost of compulsory student associations is $100 per fulltime student. If this levy were to be imposed it could cost TWA students over $2 million each year. The law does not limit the fee that can be imposed on each student.</p>
<p>Mr Peoples said compulsory student associations have long histories of misrepresentation, waste and fraud. A compulsory student association at TWA would immediately be flush with millions of dollars of fee income and would be a tempting target for fraudsters. Compulsory membership makes it impossible for students to avoid paying or withdrawing their membership from an underperforming or mismanaged organisation.</p>

<p>Given the recent problems at TWA, the institution&#39;s council should reject any proposal to form a compulsory student association. If compulsory membership is imposed on TWA students, it should be remembered that this has been made possible by Labour&#39;s legislation.</p>
<p>Mr Peoples said any decision about joining an association should be an individual choice and should not be decided by any sort of vote.</p>
<p>Student Choice upholds voluntary student association membership on the grounds of freedom of association.</p>
