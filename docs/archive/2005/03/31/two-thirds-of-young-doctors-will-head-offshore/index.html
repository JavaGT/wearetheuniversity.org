<p><strong>Thursday, 31 March 2005, 8:40 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>New figures show two thirds of young doctors will head offshore</p>
<p>New research released today by the New Zealand Medical Association (NZMA), the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) and the New Zealand Medical Students’ Association (NZMSA), Doctors and Debt: The Effect of Student Debt on Doctors, shows that after graduation average doctors’ student debt was $65,206 and that two thirds of young doctors considered that they would head offshore within three years.</p>
<p>The research also found that 48 percent of respondents considered moving overseas as a result of their student debt.</p>
<p>“These figures show that the huge student debt that medical students are forced into is pushing our desperately needed young doctors overseas in droves,” said Camilla Belich, Co-President of New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>“New Zealand medical students pay some of the highest fees in the world and as a result 75% of doctors owed over $50,000 at graduation, while 13% of respondents owed over $100,000 in student debt,” Belich said.</p>
<p>The research also demonstrated the various negative impacts of debt on of doctors’ lives.</p>
<p>“Eighty eight percent of respondents reported increased levels of stress because of their student debt and 42% said their debt would influence when and if they had children,” said Jesse Gale, President of New Zealand Medical Students’ Association (NZMSA).</p>
<p>“We call on Trevor Mallard to immediately increase the trainee intern grant, reduce medical school fees that are currently $11,000 per year and provide all students with a living allowance. Otherwise these massive debts will continue to drive young doctors overseas, and away from General Practice and rural areas,” said Gale.</p>
