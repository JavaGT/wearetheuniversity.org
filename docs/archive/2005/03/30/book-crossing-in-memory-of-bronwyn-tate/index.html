<p>Book Crossing in Memory of Bronwyn Tate, New Zealand Writer &amp; Teacher</p>
<p>New Zealand books will be popping up in all sorts of places during the first week of May. These books are being &#39;released into the wild&#39; in a book crossing to honour author and teacher Bronwyn Tate, who died in Palmerston North on 25 February.</p>
<p>A book crossing is a way of sharing books by leaving them in public places for other people to pick up and read. &#39;It is a particularly appropriate tribute to a woman who was very committed to New Zealand books,&#39; says organiser Lisa Emerson. &#39;Bronwyn promoted them whenever she could. She was an inspiration to many emerging writers, a woman of great humour, and a vital voice in New Zealand writing.&#39;</p>
<p>Bronwyn Tate&#39;s first novel, Leaving for Townsville, was published in 1997 and greeted with critical acclaim. Russian Dolls (1999), Halfway to Africa (2002) and Lily&#39;s Cupola (2003) soon followed. A fifth novel was completed shortly before her death, and will be published at a later date. Also the author of a number of published and broadcast short stories, Bronwyn Tate taught creative writing at Massey University from 2002, and reviewed New Zealand fiction for a variety of publications.</p>
<p>Participants in this book crossing are being encouraged to choose either one of Bronwyn Tate&#39;s books or a novel by another New Zealand author. Organisers hope this will encourage people to read more New Zealand fiction. Books will be labelled to identify them as part of a book crossing and released in a public place (a café, an airport or bus station, for example) for someone else to pick up. When they have finished the book, they release it again in another place.</p>
<p>People interested in participating in the book crossing should contact Lisa Emerson, <a href="mailto:L.Emerson@massey.ac.nz">L.Emerson@massey.ac.nz</a>, phone 06 356 999 ext 2601. Bronwyn Tate&#39;s novels are published by University of Otago Press.  </p>
