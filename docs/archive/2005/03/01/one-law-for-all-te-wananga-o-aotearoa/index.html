<p>One Law for All: Te Wananga o Aotearoa</p>
<p>Tariana Turia, Co-leader, Maori Party; 1 March 2005</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s proposal that Te Wananga o Aotearoa &#39;stick to its knitting&#39; and in effect close its doors to Pakeha, Pasifika and other non-Maori students is extra-ordinary, on a day when the Prime Minister has declared at the Hui Taumata: &quot;We know that working together we can build a society in which Maori, along with all New Zealanders, have a firm stake&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly that stake for Maori can only be planted in Maori contexts - and is not part of the vision for the nation that tangata whenua and non-Maori alike, have shared with us&quot;, said Tariana Turia, co-leader of the Maori Party.</p>
<p>&quot;We truly believe in the message from another keynote speaker at that hui, Moana Maniapoto, that the power and strength of tangata whenua resonates around the nation, and indeed the world&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the wonder of Maori should not be ghettoised under restricted charters, but should instead be shared with all those who want to take up an opportunity to learn&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It strikes me as somewhat bizarre that for years, Maori studies has been included as part of the core curriculum for all students in mainstream institutions - schools, polytechnics, universities. In these institutions, all students have been entitled to increase their knowledge and understanding of things Maori&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet now that Te Wananga o Aotearoa is operating so successfully, the Government has suddenly decided it must restrict its focus to Maori needs and Maori education&quot;.</p>
