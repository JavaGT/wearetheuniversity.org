<p>Students call on Govt to follow the Irish this St Patrick’s Day</p>
<p>Students are calling on the Labour Government to follow the Irish and re-introduce a system of free education this St Patrick’s day.</p>
<p>“Ireland is a country of similar size to New Zealand and has had no fees for undergraduate courses since 1996,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>“If St Patrick was able drive the snakes out of Ireland then surely Trevor Mallard can drive fees out of New Zealand,” said Kirton.</p>
<p>Student debt is now $7 billion and New Zealand fees are among the highest fees in the world.</p>
<p>“The Irish have recognised that tertiary education is fundamental in promoting the social, cultural and economic well-being of a country and believe this is something worth investing in,” said Camilla Belich, Co-President of NZUSA.</p>
<p>“Given that 60% of student debt is from fees, we would urge the Government to look to Ireland and abolish fees in tertiary education,” said Belich.</p>
