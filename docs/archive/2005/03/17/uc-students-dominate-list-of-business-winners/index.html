<p>UC students dominate list of business scholarship winners</p>
<p>University of Canterbury students dominate the latest round of the Tertiary Education Commission’s Enterprise Scholarships, winning 48 of the 62 awards.</p>
<p>The successful UC students account for just over 60 percent of the 2005 funding and their projects range from researching irrigation and gold markets in Sub-Saharan Africa and analysis of the screw cap wine bottle market, to an assessment of the funeral directing market in Canterbury.</p>
<p>The majority of the research projects have originated from the students’ involvement in the University’s Management Department’s marketing internship programme.</p>
<p>The annual programme provides students with the opportunity to work on marketing projects with New Zealand businesses during the summer period. The Enterprise Scholarships scheme supports study and research at PhD, Masters, Honours, post-graduate Diploma, post-graduate Certificate and level 7 NQF (3rd or 4th year under-graduate) levels.</p>
<p>Education Minister, Trevor Mallard, says the range of projects approved by the Tertiary Education Commission in this latest round reflects increased efforts by the tertiary sector to strengthen its links with the business sector.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the really positive aspects is the fact that companies are embracing the programme for projects that have a solid commercial underpinning. The outcomes are going to help them with their bottom lines.”</p>
<p>Enterprise Scholarships support New Zealand students to undertake a course of study involving a significant research component at a New Zealand tertiary education institution. They are undertaken in partnership with private companies or public organisations, which are required to match the government’s funding contribution.</p>
