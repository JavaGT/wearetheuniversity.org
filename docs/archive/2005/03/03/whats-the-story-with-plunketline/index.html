<p><strong>Thursday, 3 March 2005, 1:16 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Katherine Rich MP - National Party Associate Health Spokeswoman</p>
<p>03 March 2005</p>
<p>What&#39;s the story with Plunketline?</p>
<p>&quot;Annette King has some explaining to do after the latest set of figures appear to show major problems with a taxpayer-funded phone service that new parents depend on,&quot; says National Party Associate Health spokeswoman Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>According to figures released by the Health Minister only 12% of calls to the Plunketline number (now part of Healthline) were &#39;handled&#39; in January.</p>
<p>The Plunketline number was phoned 35996 times in January but only 4371 callers had their concerns dealt with - about 1 in 8 calls.</p>
<p>&quot;Last July Annette King told Kiwi parents that the reason for the merger with Healthline was not cost cutting but that 30% of Plunketline calls went unanswered.(1)</p>
<p>&quot;Kiwi parents were told that incorporating Plunketline into Healthline would &#39;ensure capacity to answer Plunketline calls&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>But according to Parliamentary Question 1802 (2005) during January 2005, 87% of calls to Healthline on the Plunketline number were not &#39;handled&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;While the Minister has made a song and dance about 24-hour coverage, that&#39;s no consolation to the thousands of parents who only get an answerphone.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister must tell us what&#39;s behind the worrying figures,&quot; says Mrs Rich.</p>
