<p>University of Auckland practically “burning” Cash</p>
<p>The University of Auckland is under-fire from students for its ”exorbitant” spend on Advertising according to figures recently obtained by the New Zealand University Students Association “The University spent over $2million dollars on an aggressive marketing campaign that appears to have had little or no effect on the choices that students made in choosing their institution of study”” Said Patrick Thomsen-Noa Education Vice President of the Auckland University Students Association</p>
<p>“That 2 million dollars would be better spent on improving support services for current students as opposed to attracting more to an already overcrowded university” Said Thomsen-Noa</p>
<p>“Sky rocketing enrolments in the University have placed a strain on the resources available for students. Burgeoning class sizes and congested walkways are creating a potentially hazardous environment.” Said Conor Roberts Administration Vice-President of the Auckland University Students Association</p>
<p>”The University of Auckland happily spent over half a million dollars in radio advertising and over $700,000 on newspaper advertisements while pleading poverty to students as fees were increased by on average of 4.1%The University are practically burning cash “ said Roberts</p>
<p>“This University has hit maximum capacity with a roll of nearly 35,000. Even the University has admitted this is an issue and yet they spent the most of any university in New Zealand last year on advertising and marketing” Said Thomsen-Noa</p>
