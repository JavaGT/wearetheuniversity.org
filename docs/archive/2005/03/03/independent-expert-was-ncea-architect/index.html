<p>Hon Bill English - National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>3 March 2005</p>
<p>&#39;Independent expert&#39; was NCEA architect</p>
<p>Labour has named one of the architects of the NCEA as the independent expert brought in to review dodgy NCEA exam results, says National&#39;s Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>Under questioning yesterday in Parliament, Trevor Mallard revealed that Alan Barker has been hired to provide expert advice to the inquiry into the NCEA.</p>
<p>&quot;I am shocked to find that Mr Barker was the NZQA&#39;s general manager of policy and planning from 1990 to 1997. He played a key role in developing NCEA so he has a personal stake in defending it.&quot;</p>
<p>Before going to NZQA he was an adviser to the former Labour Government&#39;s Education Minister between 1985 and 1990.</p>
<p>After he left NZQA he spent two years as a senior official in the State Services Commission, the body directed by Labour to conduct the review</p>
<p>After weeks of stonewalling, Labour has backed down and admitted that last year&#39;s NCEA results may not be acceptable or appropriate. David Benson-Pope has written to the State Services Commission, asking them to widen their inquiry into scholarship results to include levels 1, 2 and 3 of the NCEA.</p>
<p>Mr English says it is bad enough that even the Government doubts the quality of its own qualifications system, but it&#39;s an insult to students, teachers and parents to appoint an insider to fix it.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Barker has the ideal CV for a snow job - he was an architect of the NCEA, he knows the ins and outs of the civil service, and he will be sympathetic towards Labour&#39;s political needs.</p>
<p>&quot;Teachers, students and parents will be disgusted that their serious concerns about the NCEA are still not being taken seriously by the Labour Government,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
