<p>Dumb Economics Ruining Exporters – Peters</p>
<p>An alarming number of New Zealand exporters are starting to go to the wall because of “dumb” economic and trading policies that are causing high interest rates and an over-valued currency, claims Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>His comments follow the announced closure of Tanner Group&#39;s sawmills which will mean the loss of about 160 jobs in Northland, Waikato and the Coromandel.</p>
<p>The company has blamed the high New Zealand dollar and increased costs of infrastructure for losses in recent years.</p>
<p>Mr Peters warned that the Tanner Group’s problems represented the tip of the iceberg and that major exporters would be facing serious problems by the end of the year.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is an exporting nation and an export dependent economy. It simply cannot function properly with high interest rates and an over-valued currency. That is plain common sense.</p>
<p>“It makes it too hard for exporters to compete on world markets and at the same time makes it easy for importers to flood local markets.</p>
<p>”Many exporters will be running out of forward exchange cover over the next few months and the results of this will severely affect some of our major companies.</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s balance of payments crisis has reached unprecedented levels. Doing nothing and pleading “market forces” as some sort of excuse for inaction is economic lunacy.</p>
<p>“Our economic slide in the last 20 years goes on unchecked because of the economic approach taken by this and former governments,” said Mr Peters.</p>
