<p><strong>Wednesday, 9 March 2005, 11:42 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology">Auckland University of Technology</a></strong></p>
<p>Major PhD Scholarship in Economic Development</p>
<p>New Zealand’s first major Doctoral scholarship in Economic Development is now available from the Institute of Public Policy at AUT (Auckland University of Technology).</p>
<p>The successful candidate will be eligible for $25,000 per annum over three years. The scholarship is open to candidates conducting research in any of the major areas of economic development, but preference will be given to someone conducting research in the Creative Industries.</p>
<p>IPP director Professor Ian Shirley says the institute is involved in major international studies linking Creative Industries in New Zealand with those in London and Toronto. New Zealand is seen as innovative and enterprising in such areas as film, design, fashion and technology.</p>
<p>The IPP is the country’s major tertiary centre for economic development. It hosts the premier tertiary qualification for economic development practitioners – a part-time programme offered nationwide over two years for economic development practitioners seeking professional accreditation from EDANZ (the Economic Development Association of New Zealand).</p>
<p>The IPP also administers Masters and PhD programmes in Economic Development with candidates in these degrees linked to major research projects such as industry and regional studies within New Zealand and international projects in major cities and regions across the OECD.</p>
