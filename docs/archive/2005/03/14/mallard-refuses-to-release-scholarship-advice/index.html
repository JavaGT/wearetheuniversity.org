<p><strong>Monday, 14 March 2005, 8:20 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Mallard refuses to release scholarship policy advice</p>
<p>Trevor Mallard has refused to release policy advice he received about the school scholarship exam because he says there is too much of it, says National’s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>“The Minister’s excuse that there is so much policy advice that it can’t be released is ridiculous.</p>
<p>“This is another feeble effort by Labour to cover up its incompetent management of our secondary school qualifications,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“Mr Mallard’s admission that he has received a large amount of policy advice directly contradicts his and Helen Clark’s claims that they did not know how the scholarship worked and should not be held accountable.</p>
<p>“Parents, teachers and students deserve to know what advice the Government received and what decisions it made that have undermined public confidence in the scholarship.</p>
<p>“Mr Mallard’s refusal to release the policy advice is a breach of Official Information Act and another sign that Labour is putting all its efforts into dodging political accountability, rather than fixing the system so it works for students,” says Mr English.</p>
