<p>Paul Hutchison - National Party Health Spokesman</p>
<p>2 March 2005</p>
<p>Got piles? Go private</p>
<p>Patients with simple conditions such as piles face a choice: wait until your condition is so severe that surgery is finally warranted, or go private, says National&#39;s Health spokesman, Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>The Nelson Marlborough District Health Board admitted to the health select committee today that &#39;patients with haemorrhoids, hernias or varicose veins will not get treatment unless the condition is very severe&#39;.</p>
<p>According to the DHB&#39;s annual report 1038 people had been waiting longer than six months for a first specialist assessment as at 1 July 2004.</p>
<p>Hundreds of patients on &#39;active review&#39; had not received a clinical assessment within the last six months, the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a clear admission of Labour&#39;s failure to address some of the simple medical problems that affect tens of thousands of New Zealanders,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;By leaving haemorrhoids, hernias and varicose veins to get worse, operative complications are increased and recovery times are prolonged. The extra costs both to individuals and the health system are immense.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has spent more than $3 billion extra on health and set up a huge, complex bureaucracy, but has failed to ensure that people suffering from simple conditions are seen in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>&quot;The only options are to suffer until the condition is serious enough, or to go private,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
