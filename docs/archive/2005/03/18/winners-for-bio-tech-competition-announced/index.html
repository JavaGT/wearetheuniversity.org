<p>Winners for bio-tech competition announced</p>
<p>A machine that monitors the exercise schedules of physiotherapy patients, a landfill cap which helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and a novel treatment for stroke victims are among the winning ideas in The University of Auckland’s Inaugural Chiasma I-Volve Challenge.</p>
<p>Chiasma, an initiative aimed at addressing the need for well-rounded, enterprise-savvy biotech scientists in New Zealand, is an innovative programme designed by students for students.</p>
<p>The Chiasma I-Volve Challenge, a unique biotech ideas competition, invites students to present a two-page description of a novel biotech idea. All entries were judged by leading scientists and the top three entrants received a total of $6500 at an awards ceremony at the University.</p>
<p>Guest speaker at the awards ceremony, Professor Ross Clark, founder of NASDAQ listed biopharmaceutical company Tercica, says he is encouraged by the concept.</p>
<p>“The University of Auckland is a world-class centre for discovery and innovation. It is very encouraging that students at the University have taken the initiative to form Chiasma as a link between the University and the biotech industry.</p>
<p>“This illustrates that they understand the importance of translating University-based innovation into an enterprise culture. Such initiatives, by tomorrow&#39;s leaders, highlight the bright future of New Zealand’s biotech industry,” says Professor Clark.</p>
<p>Chiasma CEO Priv Bradoo says the aim is to foster biomedical innovation, and while the ideas may not be the next million dollar business, I-Volve encourages students to think beyond the lab.</p>
<p>“I-Volve is unique because it creates a space where you are pushing new ideas. It is encouraging healthy, creative thinking and promoting an enterprise culture – and we need both to grow the biotechnology industry as well as the economy.</p>
<p>Chief Judge Professor Joerg Kistler says the judging panel was delighted with the quality of the entries and selecting the winners was not an easy task.</p>
<p>“It was exciting to see such a wide range of novel ideas being presented by students, and it shows that there is a lot of talent that can contribute to the development of the knowledge economy in New Zealand,” says Professor Kistler.</p>
<p>At the awards ceremony, winners presented their ideas as a 55-second elevator pitch.</p>
<p>Students can also expand their ideas and enter it into spark*, The University of Auckland’s entrepreneurship challenge.</p>
<p>“With I-Volve our aim was to start the thinking. Through spark*, students can turn their two-page concept into a proposal for a commercially viable project and who knows where their ideas will take them,” says Priv.</p>
