<p>Wananga inquiry doesn&#39;t go far enough</p>
<p>Friday 18 Mar 2005</p>
<p>Ken Shirley - Press Releases - Education</p>
<p>ACT MP Ken Shirley today was disappointed with the Auditor-General&#39;s terms of reference for his inquiry into Te Wanaga o Aotearoa.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that the three core areas that would most embarrass the Government and expose the failings of government agencies have been specifically excluded from the inquiry. These are:</p>
<p>· The appropriateness of the type of funding levels of courses offered by Te Wananga o Aotearoa;</p>
<p>· Concerns about the quality of certain education courses delivered by Te Wananga o Aotearoa; and</p>
<p>· The enrolment practices, allegations about the &quot;use of inducements&quot; of Te Wananga o Aotearoa.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear that grossly inappropriate funding levels have been applied to the various courses and Crown agencies such as Tertiary Education Commission and NZQA have allowed the situation to continue on Government directive.</p>
<p>&quot;Educational priorities should be carefully examined in the tertiary sector and particularly in the Wananga. Many dubious courses have been approved such as golf and basket weaving.</p>
<p>&quot;The enrolment practices are an area in need of close examination. Apart from the wide spread practice of inducements there are the issues of phantom students and double entries. Many students have written to me expressing concern having received certificates for courses that they did not attend.</p>
<p>&quot;From the outset I believe that an independent judicial inquiry was required and now that I have seen the Auditor-General&#39;s terms of reference, I am more convinced than ever that a fuller inquiry was and still is required,&quot; Mr Shirley said.</p>
