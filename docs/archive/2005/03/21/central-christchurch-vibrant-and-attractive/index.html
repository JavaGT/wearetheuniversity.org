<p>New Research Reveals Central Christchurch ‘Vibrant And Attractive’</p>
<p>The Christchurch central city is a vibrant and attractive place, with lots of people and shoppers attracted to the area, shows new research from Lincoln University.</p>
<p>“The central city is particularly popular with teenagers seeking entertainment, as well as tourists visiting the city,” says Charles Lamb, Senior Marketing Lecturer at Lincoln University.</p>
<p>60% of teenagers surveyed said they visited the central city at least once a week.</p>
<p>“Most teenagers also found the central city more attractive than malls. Only 26% said they found malls more attractive than the central city,” says Charles Lamb.</p>
<p>The research showed that one of the reasons young people went to the central city is the easy access on buses.</p>
<p>“Young people, many of whom don’t have cars or are on restricted licences, can easily get into the central city on buses and meet their friends, without having to worry about parking.”</p>
<p>Charles Lamb says access may be one reason the central city is not attracting as many shoppers in the over 20 age bracket.</p>
<p>“Only 33% of those over 20 said they visited the central city at least once a week. Nearly three quarters (74%) of this group also said they found malls easier to get around than the central city.”</p>
<p>Charles Lamb says overall the research is good news for the central city.</p>
<p>“The heart of Christchurch is alive and well, contrary to some perceptions that it is struggling to attract shoppers and people,” says Charles Lamb.  </p>
