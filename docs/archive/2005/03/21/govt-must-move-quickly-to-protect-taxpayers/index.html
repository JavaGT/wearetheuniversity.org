<p>Govt must move quickly to protect taxpayers</p>
<p>Monday 21 Mar 2005<br>Deborah Coddington<br>Press Releases -- Economy</p>
<p>Communications Minister David Cunliffe and Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton must act immediately to recover $5 million given to a Maori trust for investment in telecommunications under the old and banished &quot;Closing the Gaps&quot; policy, ACT Communications spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>Te Huarahi Tika Trust - or Maori Spectrum Charitable Trust - was given $5 million taxpayers&#39; money in 2000 along with a 10-year right to purchase Third Generation (3-G) telecommunications spectrum at 95 percent of the lowest price received at auction. Further, the Government exempted the trust from paying gift duty on the 5 percent discount.</p>
<p>&quot;The trust gave $4 million of this to Econet Wireless, an African telco, which according to New Zealand Companies Office records has used up almost all its cash and chewed through $3.6 million in shareholder equity with still no mobile phone network in sight,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;With $6,804 cash in the bank and no overdraft facility, Econet will be struggling to &#39;increase Maori participation in the information and telecommunications sector in New Zealand&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Econet was also meant to pay the Maori trust $24,000 a year for tertiary sports scholarships and $36,000 a year for tertiary academic scholarships for Maori but there is no evidence these commitments have been met.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the Economic Development Ministry recommending in 2002 there be regular meetings between representatives of the trust and relevant Ministers - David Cunliffe of Communications, Jim Anderton of Economic Development, and Parekura Horomia of Maori Affairs - my written Parliamentary Questions have revealed that not one meeting has taken place.</p>
<p>&quot;Minister Steve Maharey&#39;s website still boasts the success of the Maori Spectrum Charitable Trust, under the heading `Closing the Digital Divide&#39; and `Te Puni Kokiri - Closing the Gaps&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Papers I have obtained under the Official Information Act show that Treasury, and the 2002 Minister of Communications Paul Swain, had reservations about this spending of taxpayers&#39; money but their concerns were ignored.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s outrageous that yet another huge chunk of taxpayers&#39; dollars have been thrown at a Maori trust, under the spurious heading of &#39;Closing the Gaps&#39;, and not one Government Minister has bothered to check up on the spending. This is another example of the lack of accountability which the Labour Government gets away with.</p>
<p>&quot;I bet Messrs Anderton and Cunliffe would never spend $5,000, let alone $5 million of their own money on a mobile phone network without making damn sure the network was up and running and the company paid to build it was kosher. It&#39;s shameful that when it comes to taxpayers&#39; money in danger of going down the drain they simply turn a blind eye,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
