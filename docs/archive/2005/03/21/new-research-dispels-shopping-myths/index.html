<p>New Research Dispels Shopping Myths</p>
<p>New research by Lincoln University is dispelling some common assumptions about our shopping habits.</p>
<p>Over a thousand shoppers were surveyed in 12 different shopping malls across Christchurch; the results have been collated by Charles Lamb, a Senior Marketing Lecturer at Lincoln University.</p>
<p>“Some of the results are surprising and fly in the face of common assumptions about why we shop where we do,” says Charles Lamb.</p>
<p>“For example, free and easy parking is often cited as one of the main reasons people to go mall. Our survey shows this is not the case,” says Charles Lamb.</p>
<p>“91.7% of our respondents cited either proximity (60.2%), convenience (16.9%) or variety and quality (14.6%) as the reasons they were shopping at a mall. Easy and free parking was cited by only 1.4% of the people we spoke to.”</p>
<p>Another surprising finding is the number of men who shop for relaxation and enjoyment.</p>
<p>“People often think men dislike shopping – it’s seen as women’s sport. However, 40% of the men we spoke with agreed they shop for relaxation and enjoyment,” says Charles Lamb.</p>
<p>The research also revealed the age group which most frequently visits shopping areas – teenagers.</p>
<p>“Nearly two-thirds of teenagers surveyed visit malls and the central city shopping area at least once a week. Unfortunately for retailers, while teenagers are the most frequent shoppers, they have the lowest incomes,” says Charles Lamb.</p>
<p>We also shop together. For people in the 20+ age bracket, 78 percent of them said they were shopping with family or friends. For teenagers, this figure jumped to 88 percent.</p>

<p>The research also contains some interesting analysis of central city shoppers.</p>
<p>“While 60% of teenagers said they visited the central city at least once a week, yet only half that number of over 20 year olds went into the central city as often,” says Charles Lamb.</p>
<p>Charles Lamb says the research has some very interesting results for mall owners and city planners.</p>
<p>“The survey shows that people are very mobile, not particularly loyal to any given mall and that most of the people visiting a particular shopping area are there because it’s close to them, ” concluded Charles Lamb.</p>
