<p>Compulsory WSU blows $60K of student money on O week</p>
<p>The compulsory Waikato Students Union (WSU) this year spent $60,000 of students&#39; money on Orientation Week events, a 200% increase over last year, Student Choice said today.</p>
<p>O Week has been a financial disaster for the compulsory students association in recent years. According to the Waikato Times WSU lost $60,000 on O Week events in 2002 and 2003. In 2004 WSU reduced its subsidy of O Week to $20,000 but has this year increased it to $60,000.</p>
<p>Membership of WSU is compulsory: the 20,000 students at Waikato University must first join the association and pay a compulsory fee. This year WSU has compulsory fee income of over half a million dollars.</p>
<p>Student Choice spokesman Glenn Peoples said it was hypocritical that student politicians who argue that all students should receive a benefit are willing to spend $60,000 of those same students&#39; money on a week of parties.</p>
<p>Peoples said he didn&#39;t have a problem with O Week events but individual students should decide whether or not they pay for them. &quot;Many students don&#39;t or can&#39;t attend O Week events so shouldn&#39;t have to subsidise those who do. Some students are struggling financially and shouldn&#39;t have money taken off them by WSU to pay for bands and parties,&quot; Peoples said.</p>
<p>Peoples also criticised the lack of information available to Waikato students so they can tell what WSU has done with their money. &quot;WSU&#39;s accounts for 2003 were not made public until November 2004, and students won&#39;t know how the association performed in 2004 until late 2005. Students don&#39;t know if O Week lost money in 2004 but we can assume it losses were substantial as the association has increased its subsidy by 200%,&quot; Peoples said.</p>

<p>&quot;Students won&#39;t know the financial performance of this month&#39;s O Week until late 2006. By that time the people who decided to sink $60,000 into O Week this month will be long gone,&quot; Peoples said.</p>
<p>Peoples said the inability of WSU to run profitable events is yet another reason why membership of the association should be voluntary.</p>
<p>Student Choice upholds voluntary membership fo student associations on the grounds of freedom of association</p>
