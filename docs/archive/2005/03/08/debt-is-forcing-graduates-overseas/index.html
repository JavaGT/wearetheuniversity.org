<p>New Government report proves student debt is forcing graduates overseas</p>
<p>The government has today released a report on student loan integrated data that proves that student debt is forcing students overseas.</p>
<p>&quot;This report proves that graduates with higher student debt are more likely to go overseas than those with a lower debt. The Government&#39;s own research confirms student debt is forcing our best and brightest overseas&quot;, said Camilla Belich, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>The report also found that graduates who are overseas have student loans that are increasing, and are paying their loans off more slowly than graduates based in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;By burdening students with unbelievable levels of student debt the government is dislocating a generation and leaving New Zealand with chronic skill shortages in key areas, &quot; Belich said.</p>
<p>The integrated data report also indicated other disturbing consequences of the student loan scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;These new figures show that the student loan scheme is unsustainable. Half of those who last borrowed in 1997 had the same or a higher debt by March 2001. To add to this, the report shows that Maori and Pasifika students have made significantly less progress towards repaying their loans,&quot; said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of NZUSA.</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard must act now by reducing fees and installing a living allowance for all instead of defending this government&#39;s shocking record on tertiary education and burying his head deeper into the sand,&quot; Kirton said.</p>
