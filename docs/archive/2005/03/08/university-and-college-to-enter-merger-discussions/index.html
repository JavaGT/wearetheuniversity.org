<p>University of Otago/Dunedin College of Education Joint Statement</p>
<p>University and College to enter Merger discussions</p>
<p>The University of Otago and the Dunedin College of Education have agreed to discuss a possible merger, University Chancellor Lindsay Brown, and College Council Chair, Kathy Grant, announced today.</p>
<p>Although both institutions currently provide their own teacher education programmes, they also co-operate in a number of areas under an existing Memorandum of Agreement.</p>
<p>“The competition of the past few years has been the exception rather than the rule”, Lindsay Brown said.</p>
<p>“The College and University have in fact worked closely together for well over a century. For almost 25 years the two institutions delivered a joint 4-year Bachelor of Education Degree, with graduates being sought by schools throughout the country,” he said.</p>
<p>“Even during the recent period of strong competition professional collegiality among University and College staff has been maintained, we have had some shared teaching, and provision of some joint services,” Kathy Grant confirmed.</p>
<p>The two institutions recognise that the potential benefits of a merger are many, including enhancing teacher education practice, and further developing educational research, scholarship, and postgraduate programmes; increasing professional development opportunities for teachers and other educators; extending the work in international education projects; and contributing to educational policy and philosophy.</p>
<p>University Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg, and College Principal Dr Roger Green have agreed to set up a small working group to look at the feasibility of a merger.</p>
<p>A preliminary report will be submitted to the two Councils as soon as possible.</p>
