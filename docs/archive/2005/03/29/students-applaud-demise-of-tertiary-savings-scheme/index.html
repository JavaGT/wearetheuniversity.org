<p>Students applaud demise of ‘hare-brained’ tertiary savings scheme</p>
<p>Students are today applauding the shelving of a controversial tertiary savings scheme recently proposed by the government.</p>
<p>“This government back-down validates what students have been saying all along; the implementation of a tertiary savings scheme will forever entrench an unaffordable system of very high tuition fees,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>Helen Clark announced in February the Government was investigating the implementation of a tertiary savings scheme, however the idea has now been put off the agenda due to policy design issues.</p>
<p>“Students hope this policy will spend the rest of its days confined to the dust-bin of failed schemes and hare-brained ideas,” Kirton said.</p>
<p>“A tertiary savings scheme was never going to work when the government is also expecting people to save for their retirement, save for a deposit for a house, and pay back their own student debt,” said Camilla Belich, Co-President of NZUSA.</p>
<p>“If the Government wants to make tertiary education more affordable it should start to address the drivers of debt like a severe lack of access to student allowances and high fees,” said Belich.</p>
