<p>Malaysian Prime Minister visits Victoria</p>
<p>The Prime Minister of Malaysia will address the topic of Islam Hadhari and good governance, when he speaks at Victoria University on Thursday 31 March.</p>
<p>The Hon Dato’ Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi arrives in New Zealand on 30 March and will be in New Zealand for three days. Mr Abdullah was sworn in for a new, five-year term in March 2004, after his coalition government won a landslide victory in parliamentary and regional elections.</p>
<p>Pro Vice-Chancellor (International), Professor Neil Quigley, said Victoria University has long-standing links with Malaysia, with active collaboration agreements with many Malaysian universities and colleges.</p>
<p>“In 2005, more than 100 new international students from Malaysia began courses, and there are more than 200 Malaysian students studying at Victoria in total. Victoria also hosts the Chair in Malay Studies, which was inaugurated in March 1996, and is jointly funded by the Malaysian and New Zealand governments.”</p>
<p>Mr Abdullah won his first parliamentary seat in 1978, and became Minister of Education in 1984, Minister of Defence from 1986-1987 and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1991 to 1999. He became Deputy Prime Minister in 1999 and the Minister of Home Affairs, and became the Prime Minister in October 2003. He is also the Chair of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC).</p>
