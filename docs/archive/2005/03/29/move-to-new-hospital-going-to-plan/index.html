<p>Move To New Hospital Going To Plan</p>
<p>At 10am tomorrow (Wednesday 30 March) the new Christchurch Women’s Hospital will open its doors for business. This follows a busy Easter weekend moving equipment from the old site to the new hospital.</p>
<p>The CDHB General Manager of Women’s &amp; Children’s Health Pauline Burt said everything was ready for tomorrow’s major activity – to move neonatal babies and patients to the new hospital.</p>
<p>‘At this stage we expect to move about 28 neonatal babies, a maximum of 15 women from the maternity ward and a maximum of five women from the gynaecology ward.’</p>
<p>Ms Burt said all transfers would be achieved using ambulances and clinical staff for support.</p>
<p>‘This is an extremely large exercise but one that we have been planning for months. All we would like is for the weather to improve. We have had daily meetings to check last minute details, but essentially we are following the plan that has been developed.’</p>
<p>Beds and equipment were moved over Easter and that part of the migration was due to be finished by end of play today (Tuesday.) A carrier company was engaged to shift everything supervised by designated staff and the exercise had been carried out without a hitch.</p>
<p>While the move was taking place, the Day Surgery Unit in the new hospital was also ready for its first operation which would be an eye operation performed by CDHB Ophthalmologist Mark Elder.</p>
