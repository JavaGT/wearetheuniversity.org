<p>Benson-Pope should stick with fish</p>
<p>Tuesday 15 Mar 2005</p>
<p>Deborah Coddington - Press Releases - Education</p>
<p>David Benson-Pope is proving to be a disgrace as Associate Education Minister and should go back to trying to regulate fish, ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite repeated claims that parents will be able to compare NCEA results between schools, his answer to my latest written Parliamentary Question proves that this will be impossible,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Benson-Pope doesn&#39;t actually say that. Oh no, the Minister would never admit that the whole aim of standards-based assessment is to eliminate competition both between schools and between individual students.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead he fudges the entire question. On the one hand he says yes, comparisons will be possible at the end of April, when results are made public.</p>
<p>&quot;Then he goes on to say parents will be able to &#39;use over 200 functionalities&#39; to compare schools. Those &#39;functionalities&#39; include &#39;gender, ethnicity, learning area, decile grouping&#39; and a number of other meaningless phrases that a parent would have to have a degree in gobbledegook to understand.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents pay the taxes that keep the Minister and his education bureaucrats in the style in which they&#39;ve become very happy - putting out meaningless blather.</p>
<p>&quot;The least they expect is some clear, precise information in language everyone can understand.</p>
<p>The answer you should have given to my question as to whether parents can compare schools&#39; NCEA results, Mr Benson-Pope, is &#39;NO&#39;. Even a fish can see that,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
