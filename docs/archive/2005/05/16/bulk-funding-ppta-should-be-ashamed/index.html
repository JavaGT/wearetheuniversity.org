<p>Hon Bill English - National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>16 May 2005</p>
<p>Bulk funding: PPTA should be ashamed</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English, says the PPTA&#39;s arguments against bulk funding are absolute nonsense and the union should be ashamed of itself for blatantly misleading its members.</p>
<p>In the latest edition of PPTA News, PPTA President Debbie Te Whaiti outlines the union&#39;s arguments against bulk funding. The union says the reintroduction of bulk funding would see parents pay more school fees, force schools into high-risk ventures (like the recruitment of international students) and force them to hire &#39;cheaper&#39; teachers.</p>
<p>Mr English says if this is all the PPTA can come up with then the argument is already over.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the abolition of bulk funding, parental fees and contributions have increased by 35% to over $200 million annually.</p>
<p>&quot;Claims that schools will be forced into recruiting more foreign fee-paying students are also rubbish. Since bulk funding was abolished, the number of international students has increased from 5,000 to 17,500, generating an extra $85 million annually.</p>
<p>&quot;If the PPTA is worried about foreign students, it should be attacking Labour&#39;s school funding policies.</p>
<p>&quot;The union&#39;s third ridiculous claim that schools will have to hire &#39;cheap&#39; teachers - presumably new graduates - doesn&#39;t stand up either. More than 3,000 &#39;cheap&#39; teachers are already employed in our school system and the PPTA hasn&#39;t made a peep about them.</p>
<p>&quot;If the PPTA has a problem with new teachers it should come out and say so. Hiding behind the bulk funding argument is nonsense.</p>
<p>&quot;The facts and realities of the past five years directly and embarrassingly contradict the PPTA&#39;s arguments. The union should stop misleading its members and start thinking about our children,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
