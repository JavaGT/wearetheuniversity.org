<p>18 May 2005<br>Leading American environmental historian to visit University of Otago</p>
<p>An American environmental historian, widely regarded as a world leader in his field, will visit the University of Otago later this month.</p>
<p>Professor Donald Worster, from the University of Kansas, has written several influential books, which have helped shape thinking on environmental history.</p>
<p>Professor Tom Brooking, from the University of Otago’s History Department, says that Professor Worster is well known to both historians and environmentalists alike.</p>
<p>“Ecology is a fairly new discipline and his first book, Nature’s Economy: A history of ecological ideas was the first on the history of ecology. He is certainly a key founder in this way of looking at the past.”</p>
<p>Professor Worster also penned Dust Bowl, considered a classic work of environmental history examining the cause and devastating effects of this 1930s ecological disaster.</p>
<p>His reflections on the past have also given him a focus on the future with his work Rivers of Empire which delves into irrigation and the problem of salination, the effects of which are being seen in the Indian sub-continent and parts of Australia.</p>
<p>“In some ways he is a bit of an Old Testament prophet, warning people to learn from their past mistakes,” Professor Brooking says.</p>
<p>One of Professor Worster’s current projects, a biography of pioneering conservationist John Muir has something of a Dunedin connection. Muir, a Scot who was heavily influenced by the poet Robbie Burns and in particular his works on nature, visited the city in 1904.</p>
<p>Professor Worster will give a lecture in Archway Lecture Theatre One (Union Street) on Friday 27 May at 5.10pm entitled &quot;John Muir and the Modern Passion for Nature: From Scotland to America and the World&quot;; and on Saturday morning, 28 May from 9 a.m to 1 p.m. he will lead a seminar at the University College (Unicol) seminar room on &quot;Living in Nature: Environmental History and Biography.&quot;</p>
