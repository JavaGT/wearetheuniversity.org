<p>Otago announces new Dux Scholarships</p>
<p>All secondary school duxes in New Zealand are eligible for first year undergraduate scholarships announced by the University of Otago today.</p>
<p>Announcing the scholarships, Vice-Chancellor David Skegg said Otago University, as a national university, wanted to ensure with the dux scholarships that at least one outstanding student from every school in the country had the opportunity to study at Otago.</p>
<p>“No matter the size of the school or its academic reputation, this gives high-achieving students a chance to attend New Zealand’s finest university,” Professor Skegg said.</p>
<p>“These first year scholarships will give the students an opportunity to experience Otago and encourage them to complete their studies here. And Otago will benefit from having some of the best and brightest students contributing to the University community,” he said.</p>
<p>The first scholarships will be available for students attending Otago in 2006. The scholarships are worth $3,500 each and can be used towards the cost of accommodation in a residential college or hall and/or fees.</p>
