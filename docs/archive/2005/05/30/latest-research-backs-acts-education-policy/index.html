<p>Latest research backs ACT&#39;s education policy</p>
<p>Groundbreaking research released today backs ACT&#39;s education policies that trust parents and schools to make decisions, not education bureaucrats, ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>“A Colmar Brunton survey of 1001 randomly selected parents in August 2004 shows exactly what ACT has been promoting – Let Parents Choose,” Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>“The survey revealed:</p>
<p>“A staggering 79 percent believe schools should be free to offer alternative examinations such as the International Baccalaureate or Cambridge A Levels if they choose to do so.</p>
<p>“This backs up ACT&#39;s policy of allowing schools to dump the NCEA if they wish to.</p>
<p>“76 percent of parents think schools should be permitted to specialise in particular subject areas or sport if they choose to do so.</p>
<p>“This backs up ACT&#39;s policy that one size does not fit all in education.</p>
<p>“84 percent of parents believe that individual schools should be allowed to teach their individual community&#39;s positive ideas.</p>
<p>“This backs up ACT&#39;s policy that the education bureaucrats and politicians don&#39;t know what&#39;s best for every school, every student.</p>
<p>“Only 30 percent of parents believe the Ministry of Education should decide what their children learn in school.</p>
<p>“In other words, the bureaucrats should just, as the kids say, butt out.</p>
<p>“And further damning evidence for the Government in terms of the NCEA, which Trevor Mallard insists is &#39;a triumph&#39;, is shown in this survey.</p>
<p>“Only 31 percent of parents have confidence in the value of the NCEA.</p>
<p>“Only 27 percent thought the NCEA provides a clear measure of a pupil&#39;s abilities.</p>
<p>“ACT congratulates the Maxim Institute for undertaking this important research. It&#39;s now time for the Government to listen to parents and give them back the right to choose,” Miss Coddington said.</p>
