<p>Greens call on MPs to join the anti-whaling cause</p>
<p>The Greens are asking MPs from all parties to sign a joint letter to the Japanese Prime Minister opposing his government&#39;s recent decision to expand its whaling programme.</p>
<p>&quot;The Japanese Government is much more likely to take notice of New Zealand protestations about its whaling if it knows that all our political parties are speaking with one voice,&quot; Green Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s why we&#39;re asking all MPs to sign a letter to Mr Koizumi, which explains that whales are precious to New Zealanders but are under threat from Japanese whaling practices.&quot;</p>
<p>The Japanese Government recently announced it planned to begin killing humpback and fin whales, and increase the number of minke whales it already kills.</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers of whales has diminished from about 100,000 to only a few thousand, and this is a direct result of the whaling undertaken by only a handful of countries, including Japan,&quot; Ms Fitzsimons said. &quot;Harpooning is a particularly slow, bloody, and painful death.</p>
<p>&quot;Whales were once a common sight off New Zealand&#39;s coast, and tourists and locals are thrilled to see them. However, sightings of whales are becoming more and more rare.</p>
<p>&quot;I find it hard to believe that any MPs are pro-whaling. This letter gives them all, no matter their differences on other policies, an opportunity to stand up for these beautiful animals that New Zealanders hold dear,&quot; Ms Fitzsimons said.</p>
<p>Australian Green Senator Bob Brown is organising a similar letter for Australian legislators.  </p>
