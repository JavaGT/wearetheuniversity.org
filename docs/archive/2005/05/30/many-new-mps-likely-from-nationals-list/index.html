<p><strong>Monday, 30 May 2005, 8:33 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Many new MPs likely from National’s list</p>
<p>National’s 2005 list will bring many new faces to Parliament after the upcoming election, says National Party President Judy Kirk.</p>
<p>National is targeting an election result that would give it at least 50 MPs. If the actual result reflected this weekend’s published polls (NZ Herald and Sunday Star Times) the Party would have between 45 and 47 MPs in Parliament. With all current MPs included on the list for the first time, that means those down to at least the mid-40s can expect to be going to Wellington.</p>
<p>“As well as the obviously high-profile returning and new MPs like WTO trade negotiator Tim Groser, Te Atatu candidate Hon Tau Henare, former Wellington Mayor Mark Blumsky (Wellington Central) and Rangitoto College Principal Alan Peachey (Tamaki), there will be a wide variety of different faces from throughout New Zealand life,” Mrs Kirk says.</p>
<p>Wellington barrister Chris Finlayson (Mana) is very well-placed at 27, as is Christchurch businesswoman and regional councillor Nicky Wagner (Christchurch Central) at 28 and Timaru nurse Jo Goodhew (Aoraki) at 31.</p>
<p>Hamilton East candidate David Bennett, third-time Whanganui candidate and policeman-turned-lawyer Chester Borrows, hard-working West Coaster Chris Auchinvole, and Northcote candidate Dr Jonathan Coleman are all certainties on the list.</p>
<p>Judy Kirk says there are seven women candidates in the top 20 of potential new MPs.</p>
<p>“Nicky Wagner and Jo Goodhew are joined by Christchurch lawyer Kate Wilkinson (Waimakiriri), Otago candidate and former Play School presenter Jacquie Dean, Auckland breast physician Dr Jackie Blue (Mt Roskill), returning National MP Anne Tolley (East Coast), and Auckland recruitment manager Paula Bennett (Waitakere).”</p>

<p>Provincial New Zealand is also well represented. As well as those already mentioned, former National MP Eric Roy (Invercargill), newcomer Nathan Guy (Otaki), Kaikoura’s Colin King and second time candidate Craig Foss (Tukituki) are all in very electable list positions.</p>
<p>If National achieves its aim of at least 50 MPs, the “Top 20” will be joined by Wellington accountant and mother of three Katrina Shanks (Ohariu-Belmont), Samoan businesswoman Fepulea’I Ulua’ipou-O-Malo Aiono (Manurewa), Indian Baptist Pastor Ravi Musuku (Mt Albert), plus two candidates who are fighting hard to win their constituency seats; “Bob the Builder” Clarkson in Tauranga and former senior MFAT official John Hayes, in the Wairarapa seat.</p>
