<p>Budget Blues for Schools</p>
<p>New Zealand First says that the Budget would be seen by secondary, area and middle schools as a real disappointment, and is calling for an urgent review of the funding formula.</p>
<p>“Once again, the Government continues to adjust school operational funding instead of re-examining the total basis for the operational formula,” said associate education spokesperson Jim Peters.</p>
<p>“No school will be persuaded by a ‘nominal increase’, which is in fact nothing more than tinkering to make it look as if something is happening.</p>
<p>“Principals and boards deserve better as they struggle with their present inadequate operational funding to meet the needs of the specialised schools of 2005 and beyond.</p>
<p>“A review of the formula is urgently needed, as was done in 1988/89.</p>
<p>“Minor adjustments and short-funded programmes are of little value for the students of today and the future,” said Mr Peters.</p>
