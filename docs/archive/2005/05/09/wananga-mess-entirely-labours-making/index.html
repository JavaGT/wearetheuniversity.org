<p><strong>Monday, 9 May 2005, 3:40 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Bill English<br>National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>9 May 2005</p>
<p>Wananga mess entirely Labour&#39;s making</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English says the mess at Te Wananga o Aotearoa is entirely of Labour&#39;s making.</p>
<p>The Minster of Education today approved an urgent $20 million loan to help meet the wananga&#39;s immediate financial needs.</p>
<p>Mr English says it is typical of Labour to throw money at a problem in the hope that it will go away.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has been throwing taxpayers&#39; money at the wänanga for six years now without demanding anything in return in the way of standards or accountability.</p>
<p>&quot;The wänanga has been encouraged by Labour&#39;s policy that provides strong incentives for it to enrol thousands of students in large-scale, low-cost courses.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour was never sure that the students enrolled in these courses started them, let alone completed them.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard also spent $120,000 on a consultant to watch over the wänanga. Either he chose to ignore the advice of the consultant or it was a waste of money.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of Labour&#39;s stupid tertiary policy this will be the first of many taxpayer bailouts of tertiary institutions going broke.</p>
<p>&quot;It is time Helen Clark held the Minister of Education to account for the trail of carnage he has left in the tertiary education sector,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
