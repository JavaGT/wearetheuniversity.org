<p><strong>Friday, 6 May 2005, 3:41 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Green Party School Lunch Survey</p>
<p>The Green Party conducted a survey of 50 primary and secondary schools to monitor what type of foods are being sold by schools to children who buy their lunches.</p>
<p>The results show that while many schools do offer healthy lunches, they are also selling foods loaded with fat and sugar.</p>
<p>Some of those schools with poor lunch menus are participants of the Ministry of Education supported Healthy Schools Programme.</p>
<p>Most schools sell lunches everyday, meaning that children are able to eat unhealthy lunches everyday if they chose to, or if their parents are unable to make lunches.</p>
<p>School Lunches Results</p>
<p>98% of schools sell pies, hotdogs, ‘hotbites’ or sausage rolls. 72% sell chips – ( in five of 50 schools those were corn chips, and in one wedges). 80% of schools sell cookies / cakes / chocolate / donuts In 68% of schools the menu does not include fruit. In 24% of schools the roll or sandwich is more expensive than the pie. In 22% of schools there is no roll or sandwich on the menu. 30% have yoghurt on the menu. 16% of schools sell muesli bars. 24% list water on the menu. In 8% school lunches are only available one day a week.</p>
