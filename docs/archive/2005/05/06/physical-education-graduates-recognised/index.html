<p>Physical Education graduates recognised with Wall of Fame</p>
<p>Many students have passed through the doors of the University of Otago’s School of Physical Education over its 57 years of operation.</p>
<p>And many of them have gone on to excel in a wide range of academic, professional and sporting careers.</p>
<p>In 2003 Associate Professor Rex Thomson left the School after more than 20 years, and as a departing gift pledged a generous donation towards a Wall of Fame, which will recognise graduates who have distinguished themselves in their chosen fields.</p>
<p>Now, the challenge has been taken up by Dr Phil Handcock and the Wall of Fame will be launched by Dunedin’s Mayor Peter Chin to graduates and alumni of the School tomorrow, after the School’s graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>Dr Handcock says the Wall will be a chance to celebrate the success of the School’s former students.</p>
<p>“We are calling for nominations from alumni and the first names will be inducted this time next year. There are many very successful graduates from this School, and we expect there will be more than enough suitable nominations.</p>
<p>“An advisory group of graduates will consider the nominations against the selection criteria.”</p>
<p>Dr Handcock says the Wall will be an inspiration to current students as well as offering opportunities for the School’s alumni to have an ongoing involvement.</p>
