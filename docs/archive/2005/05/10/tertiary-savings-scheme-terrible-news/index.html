<p>Tertiary Savings Scheme Terrible News for Students</p>
<p>Trevor Mallard’s steps towards establishing a Tertiary Education Savings Scheme are nothing but bad news for students, according to OUSA president Steven Sutton.</p>
<p>“Student Debt is $7billion and counting, the number of students receiving a living allowance has plummeted, and now the government is trying to pass the buck on to hard-working families. Is that really the best they can do?” asked Mr. Sutton.</p>
<p>If implemented, the Tertiary Education Savings Scheme will force the current generation of graduates to decide between paying off their own student loans and contributing to a savings scheme so their children won’t be burdened with debt.</p>
<p>“This is at the same time that they’re probably going to have to support their parents in retirement” mused Mr. Sutton.</p>
<p>“Labour already pushes the ridiculous line that students should live out of their parents’ pockets until they are twenty-five, and this scheme will just allow the government to further shirk their responsibilities to students and leave families in the lurch.”</p>
<p>Mr. Mallard’s savings proposal will have no impact whatsoever on the current student debt crisis, as the scheme will not come into effect for two decades.</p>
<p>“The only way that the student debt situation is going to be eased is if the government recognises one simple, reasonable point: students have the same rights to a living allowance as all other New Zealanders do” concluded Mr. Sutton.</p>
