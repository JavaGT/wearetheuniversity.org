<p>Liberty Belle</p>
<p>Yesterday we had the Budget foisted upon us. Remember Labour’s 1999 ‘Pledge Card’? It included the words, “there will be no new taxes”. And what have we seen – Labour’s Roll of Dishonour:</p>
<p>Income tax increased from 33% to 39% for those earning more than $60,000.</p>
<p>Fringe benefit tax up from 49% to 64%.</p>
<p>Trust income tax up from 19.5% to 33%.</p>
<p>Resident withholding tax – deduction rate on interest from either 19.5% or 33% to 39%.</p>
<p>Tobacco tax – increase in the average cost of a packet of cigarettes from $7.20 to $8.20.</p>
<p>Petrol tax up 4.7c plus GST.</p>
<p>Import fee - $18 on all imported commercial goods for goods with a GST liability of more than $50.</p>
<p>Petrol – ACC levy increased from 2.3c to 5.08c per litre.</p>
<p>Alcohol – so-called ‘sherry tax’ – increasing cost from $21 to $38 a litre for beverages with 14-23% alcohol content.</p>
<p>ACC levies – farmers have faced a 74% hike in their ACC levies in the past three years.</p>
<p>ACC motor vehicle levies – motorbike levy up by 57%.</p>
<p>Birth, death and marriage certificate fees increased by 42.9%.</p>
<p>Driver licence renewal fees increased from $29.50 to $44.30.</p>
<p>Fire service levy, household levy increased by 17.70% and increase in motorists’ levy of 17.7% collected by insurance companies.</p>
<p>Fishing licence fee increase of 10%.</p>
<p>Cattle slaughtering levy increased up to 50% per head of slaughtered cattle.</p>
<p>Export education levy – a $185 charge to institutions per foreign fee-paying student plus 0.45% of their tuition and course fees.</p>

<p>Fund withdrawal tax – 5% tax on withdrawals of employer contributions to superannuation schemes for those earning above $60,000.</p>
<p>Border Security Bill - $20 million on importers and exporters for a service deemed public good.</p>
<p>Car ownership rego increased 14%.</p>
<p>Fuel excise and road user charges pegged to inflation, but no reduction on amount of taxes siphoned into the consolidated fund.</p>
<p>New levies on non-petrol driven vehicles increased from $176.10 to $221.31.</p>
<p>Increase in fuel excise levy of 5c per litre, and an equivalent rise in road user charges for light diesel vehicles.</p>
<p>Kyoto fund – extra 1c per unit on electricity.</p>
<p>Kyoto fund – extra 4c per litre on fuel.</p>
<p>30% increase in road-user charges for diesel vehicles.</p>
<p>This is your money. You are being robbed.</p>
<p>Yours in liberty,</p>
