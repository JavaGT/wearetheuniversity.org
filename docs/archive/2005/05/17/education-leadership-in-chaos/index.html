<p>Education leadership in chaos</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English, says school closures could be back on the agenda now that Helen Clark has given Trevor Mallard all responsibilities for education in a desperate attempt to stabilise leadership in the sector.</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard was removed from the schools portfolio because he became a political liability over school closures and the NCEA debacle.</p>
<p>&quot;He has now resumed the portfolio after David Benson-Pope&#39;s dumping.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents should be worried that school closures will be back and that Trevor Mallard does not have the credibility necessary to rebuild public confidence in NCEA.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s no wonder Labour is getting desperate.</p>
<p>&quot;The Tertiary Education Commission lost its Chair and Chief Executive last year, and it took 12 and 9 months respectively to replace them.</p>
<p>&quot;NZQA has lost its Chair and Chief Executive, and permanent replacements are unlikely to be found this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Late last year Steve Maharey was removed from tertiary education for incompetence and to protect his reputation as the next Labour leader.</p>
<p>&quot;David Benson-Pope, as a Clark favourite, was on track to replace Trevor Mallard but now his future is under a cloud.</p>
<p>&quot;Fortunately, teachers will continue to teach and children will continue to learn.</p>
<p>&quot;But the answer to the chaos Labour finds itself in, in the education sector is certainly not the discredited minister Trevor Mallard,&quot; Mr English says.</p>
