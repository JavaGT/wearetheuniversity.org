<p><strong>Tuesday, 17 May 2005, 11:01 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Bogus Job Offers Been Around For Years Why No Action Until Now? Asks Peters</p>
<p>Despite repeated warnings over the past three years, the Immigration Service appears to have only just realised that thousands of immigrants gained residency here with false job offers, says Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>The New Zealand First leader was responding to a TVNZ investigation that has reportedly discovered a number of immigration scams involving bogus job offers.</p>
<p>“This has become rife,” said Mr Peters, “just about everyone else in New Zealand knows that there has been widespread immigration fraud involving false job offers, false qualifications and false family declarations.</p>
<p>“Many cases have been reported to immigration ministers and officials but they all seem to all disappear down a black hole, never to see daylight – or an investigation.</p>
<p>“Thousands of people who should not be in New Zealand are here enjoying the benefits of this country courtesy of the long suffering taxpayers.</p>
<p>“Immigration officials and the government have absolutely no idea of who they have let into the country and it is long past the time for some investigation to be mounted.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is a dumping ground for international fraudsters and cheats. Many are in state houses receiving benefits.</p>
<p>“It is an absolute disgrace,” said Mr Peters.  </p>
