<p>VC Medal for Sgt Manahi Would Be Justice</p>
<p>New Zealand First veterans’ affairs spokesperson Bill Gudgeon is calling on the Government to give recognition to Second World War hero Sergeant Haane Manahi’s gallantry by awarding him the Victoria Cross.</p>
<p>Mr Gudgeon said it was a grave injustice that the original recommendation for Sergeant Manahi to be awarded the Victoria Cross in 1943 was rejected.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First is adamant that the medal should be awarded to Sergeant Haane Manahi in posthumous recognition of his gallantry during service because all the evidence shows he earned it.</p>
<p>“Sergeant Manahi is a World War II hero, and his bravery is a matter of record. The Maori Battalion attack on enemies in Tunisia in 1943 has been described by British Lieutenant-General Sir Brian Horrocks as the most gallant feat of arms he witnessed in the course of the war.</p>
<p>“But, for reasons unknown, the recommendation was downgraded to a Distinguished Conduct Medal, and New Zealand First believes it is time the Government recognised this injustice and upgraded the award.</p>
<p>“Sergeant Manahi’s action epitomised the commitment and courage shown by many New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“All former soldiers believe it is time for justice to be done,” said Mr Gudgeon.</p>
