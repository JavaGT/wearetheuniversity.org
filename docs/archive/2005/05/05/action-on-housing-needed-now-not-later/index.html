<p>Action on housing needed now, not later</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s new housing strategy is a step in the right direction but leaves a number of questions unanswered, Green Party Housing Spokesperson Sue Bradford says.</p>
<p>&quot;We urgently need to know how many dollars the Government is actually going to put towards implementing it and which parts - and not just in the next three years, but over the next 10 to 15,&quot; Ms Bradford says.</p>
<p>The strategy, released today, does a good job of identifying the issues but simply highlights the need that action is needed now, not later.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a crisis of major proportions affecting both urban and rural New Zealand. It can&#39;t be fixed by 2000 extra state houses in Auckland over the next two years, or by increasing the Accommodation Supplement as is happening through Working for Families.&quot;</p>
<p>More and more people are unable to buy their own home; can&#39;t afford the rent in the private sector even with the Accommodation Supplement; and are living in substandard or overcrowded accommodation. There is nowhere near enough emergency housing, or accommodation for people with mental illness and other disabilities, she says.</p>
<p>&quot;Reviewing the Accommodation Supplement is not enough - while it continues to grow, all it is doing is providing a taxpayer subsidy to landlords, employers and banks, not getting people into their own homes,&quot; she says</p>
<p>This is highlighted in the report with the dramatically falling rates of home ownership.</p>
<p>One of the key answers to this is to get rid of the student loan scheme and deal with graduate debt, which is crippling a generation&#39;s aspirations. The introduction of a Universal Child Benefit which, could be capitalised for a first home deposit, would also help people into their own homes.</p>
<p>Government also needs to move more quickly and extensively on improving energy efficiency in homes, including in the private rental market where low-income people are often trapped by high power bills, which they can do nothing to avoid, she said</p>
