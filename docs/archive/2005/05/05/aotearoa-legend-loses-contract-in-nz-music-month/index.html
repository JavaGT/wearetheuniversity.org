<p>Legend of Aotearoa Loses Contract in New Zealand Music Month</p>
<p>Co-leader, Maori Party; Tariana Turia</p>
<p>Wednesday 4 May</p>
<p>“I was saddened to learn that a virtual legend of Aotearoa has had his contract cut, forcing the closure of an immensely popular radio show” said Tariana Turia, co-leader of the Maori Party.</p>
<p>“It is particularly ironic that the funding cut has arisen in a week, that the Government is promoting as celebrating New Zealand Music, when a talented musician and entertainer is not supported”.</p>
<p>“Papa Ruru (Hori Bennett) has entertained, listened, and soothed worried minds of thousands of New Zealanders for over sixteen years” said Mrs Turia. “It was therefore extremely disappointing to hear that as of 30 June, the Papa Ruru show will be shut down”.</p>
<p>“Whilst I understand the need for Te Mangai Paho to demonstrate transparency through a contestable process, one can not fail to feel sad at the loss of such a treasured institution as this show”.</p>
<p>“Papa Ruru takes up to 13,000 calls a month from callers who faithfully listen in five days a week, fifty-two weeks a year, from 12pm to 6am”.</p>
<p>“Our kaumatua are loyal and devoted listeners, who have relied on their night-time talkback show, to sustain their spirits. I feel sad for our old people, who will certainly miss such a vital presence in their lives”.</p>
<p>“The Papa Ruru show has been an immensely popular programme, and I commend Hori and his team, for the distinctive contribution they have given to this nation”.</p>
