<p>Compulsory VUWSA flipflops on VUW marketing</p>
<p>Just two months after criticising Victoria University&#39;s marketing expenditure, the compulsory Victoria University Students Association (VUWSA) has collaborated with Victoria University in an advertising campaign, Student Choice spokesman Glenn Peoples said today.</p>
<p>Last week VUWSA in conjunction with Salient and Victoria University&#39;s Marketing Group purchased the cover of Auckland student magazine Craccum. The editor of Salient said the $2500 cost of the ad came entirely from the university&#39;s marketing budget.</p>
<p>In March VUWSA president Jeremy Greenbrook condemned Victoria University&#39;s marketing budget as a waste of money. Greenbrook said students are not influenced by advertising when choosing where to study. Greenbrook said, &quot;research shows that very few students pay any attention to this sort of advertising.&quot; Last week Greenbrook said he welcomed the joint marketing effort.</p>
<p>Glenn Peoples said VUWSA&#39;s flipflop was probably driven by rivalry between student politicians and showed the association was willing to apply double standards when it suited.</p>
<p>Mr Peoples said this is exactly the type of hypocrisy we&#39;ve come to expect from compulsory student associations. &quot;Compulsory-funded student politicians oppose tuition fees yet impose their own political fees on students; they oppose the student loan scheme yet derive half their income from money borrowed under the scheme; and they claim to speak on behalf of all students when they know all too well that many students don&#39;t agree with associations&#39; policies,&quot; Peoples said.</p>
<p>Now we have student politicians opposing institution&#39;s marketing and then cooperating with it when it suits them. VUWSA&#39;s already- diminished credibility has just suffered another massive hit through this latest about-face, Peoples said.</p>
