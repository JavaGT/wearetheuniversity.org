<p>ACT holds candidate meetings</p>
<p>Catherine Judd<br>Friday, 27 May 2005<br>Press Releases - Other</p>
<p>ACT President Catherine Judd today said she was delighted by the high calibre of candidates who will be standing for ACT at the upcoming election.</p>
<p>Ms Judd and the ACT Board of Trustees and members are meeting candidates this weekend in Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington in advance of the ACT list which will be announced on 13 June.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m confident that all these candidates will run a strong Party Vote campaign for ACT, and improve on the 145,000 votes we won at the last election,&quot; Ms Judd said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our candidates represent a broad cross-section of middle New Zealand, and include teachers, small business owners, farmers and students. It is especially pleasing to note that 15 of our candidates are under the age of 25.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT will field over 60 candidates on its list, and will be standing in most constituency seats for the Party Vote - with the exception of ACT Leader Rodney Hide, who will be campaigning for the seat of Epsom,&quot; Ms Judd said.</p>
<p>Last week ACT members were sent ballot papers to allow them to rank their choices for the top 20 candidates to be included on the list.</p>
