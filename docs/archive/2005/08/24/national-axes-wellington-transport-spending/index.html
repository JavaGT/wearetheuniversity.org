<p>PRESS RELEASE<br>24 August 2005: National axes Wellington transport spending</p>
<p>John Key&#39;s published transport spending plan reveals that National would cut Wellington&#39;s $885 million transport packages if elected says Ohariu-Belmont Labour Candidate Charles Chauvel.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has announced $885 million extra for Wellington out of the Crown Account, $190 million of that is to be spent over the next three years. Not a cent of this is included in Mr Key&#39;s published transport spending plans”, says Charles Chauvel.</p>
<p>“Commuters who remember the 1990s will not be surprised to hear National has budgeted nothing to upgrade commuter rail services and to improve roading links”.</p>
<p>&quot;It’s the same old story with National, roading projects cancelled so that those like Messrs Key and Brash get an extra $92 a week in their pockets. They did it throughout the 1990s and they are planning to do it again.</p>
<p>“Messrs Brash and Key&#39;s claims that they would back Labour spending plans for Wellington as well as shifting more petrol tax over into roading have been revealed by Mr Key as baloney. National remains in vociferous denial but their own figures tell the truth.&quot;</p>
