<p>NZUSA research proves students borrow because of need, not greed</p>
<p>New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA) research on student expenditure confirms that there will be little incentive for most students to borrow extra following the introduction of Labour&#39;s interest-free loan scheme.</p>
<p>According to the NZUSA -TNS Research Income and Expenditure Survey released in January, the average essential living costs for students add up to almost $100 more than they are entitled to borrow from the student loan scheme.</p>
<p>Additionally, 45% of students have a bank overdraft, 22% borrow from credit cards and 20% have a loan to their parents.</p>
<p>&quot;Students borrow from the loan scheme because they have to get by, not because they want to make a quick buck. Borrowing from the loan scheme is motivated by need, not greed,&quot; said Andrew Kirton, Co-president of the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>&quot;Students can only borrow up to $150 per week. This is a lot less than most need to live, and they use credit cards, personal loans, family borrowing and overdrafts to cover the difference. There is clearly nothing left to invest,&quot; said Kirton.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if these students want to borrow more, under the current loan scheme they can&#39;t. The claims that students will borrow the maximum and invest it if there was 0% interest is highly insulting to the thousands of students who are struggling to make ends meet,&quot; said Camilla Belich, Co-president of NZUSA.</p>
<p>&quot;Students are fully aware that they will have to pay back every cent of what they borrow, and they are also reluctant to get interest-free loans from family members at the moment for this very reason,&quot; said Belich.</p>
<p>Average costs for students per week:</p>
<p>. Food: $61</p>
<p>. Accommodation: $116</p>
<p>. Living expenses: $40</p>
<p>. Transport: $32</p>
<p>Total: $249</p>
