<p>Pamphlet reveals true agenda of pro-beating lobby</p>
<p>Green Children&#39;s Issues Spokesperson Sue Bradford says she is deeply disturbed that a pamphlet advocating the beating of children with implements has been distributed in an Auckland school.</p>
<p>&quot;In a democracy, I accept accept the right of the pro-beating lobby to say what they want, but I am very concerned that their dangerous propaganda has been distributed by Carey College in Panmure,&quot; Ms Bradford said.</p>
<p>&quot;Schools simply should not be encouraging their parents to beat their kids with rods, especially given that we live in a country with one of the worst rates of violence against children in the developed world.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Bradford said the pamphlet, written by Family Integrity&#39;s national director Craig Smith, was based in a &quot;menacing theology&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The pamphlet and the Family Integrity website seem motivated by the premise that children are born evil and need to have their sin beaten out of them. I reject absolutely the idea that parents have a God-given right to beat the evil out of their kids. I&#39;m sure the vast majority of Kiwi parents, including the vast majority of Christians, would agree with me that this theology is both extreme and dangerous.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Bradford said the pamphlet exposed the real agenda of the pro-beating lobby, and showed why her Section 59 Repeal Bill was necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;Opponents of my Section 59 Bill say they are worried about loving parents who occasionally lightly smack their kids being criminalised. This pamphlet reveals that, for some, what they&#39;re really worried about is losing what they see as their God-given right to beat their children, with rods if necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;This pamphlet strengthens the case for my Bill. It illustrates the extent to which supporters of the Section 59 wish to encourage parents to use the defence of &#39;reasonable force&#39; as cover for seriously beating their kids.&quot;</p>
