<p>Don Brash Writes - Campaign Edition</p>
<p>---------------------------</p>
<p>No. 66, 16 August 2005 - Campaign Edition</p>
<p>---------------------------</p>
<p>Welcome to the first of my Don Brash Writes &quot;Campaign Editions&quot;, to keep you up to date with what I&#39;m doing around New Zealand, talking to hardworking New Zealanders about the issues that matter to them and their families. Parliament has adjourned, electioneering has barely begun, and, as during my visit to Waitangi in 2004, already the mud is flying.</p>
<p>Read the speech I delivered in the adjournment debate at this link:</p>

<p>---------------------------</p>
<p>Tax policy will be a defining issue at this election, and it&#39;s a stark choice between Labour, who want more of your hard earned money, and National, who think that you are the best person to decide how your money is spent. Rather than personal attacks and gutter politics, National is fighting this election on the issues that matter to mainstream New Zealanders. We have already announced that the cost of childcare for pre-school children will be tax deductible for working parents up to $5000 per child; and that the interest on student loans will be tax deductible against earned income in New Zealand. And we will be announcing the other components of our tax policy within the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>A stark choice:</p>

<p>And why are more than 600 New Zealanders leaving the country permanently each week? It&#39;s not student loans (only 5.4% of student loan borrowers live overseas). It&#39;s the failure of Labour to lift the real wage rates of workers, and improve standards of living for all. That is why I went into politics in 2002. Unlike the Labour Party, I&#39;m not going to offer shortsighted bribes that the country simply cannot afford, paid for from the taxes of hardworking New Zealanders. Because of the outflow of New Zealanders, we have become increasingly reliant on migrants to plug the skills gaps. Last week, I outlined National&#39;s plan for immigration at a meeting of over 500 people in Wanganui.</p>
<p>600 New Zealanders leaving the country:</p>

<p>I met with industrial workers on a recent visit to Rotorua. They were astounded to learn that the Labour Government spends $14 million per day of taxpayers&#39; money on welfare benefits, and creating generations of welfare dependent families in the process. National has a plan to fix this.</p>

<p>---------------------------</p>
<p>Meeting the needs of older New Zealanders is just as important as stopping the mass exodus of young New Zealanders to greener pastures overseas. National has policies that attract young and old. The SuperBlues website, which outlines our policies for older New Zealanders, is proving a big hit, as is the recently relaunched Young Nats website. I encourage you to visit both.</p>

<p>This week, I head to Nelson, to the hotly contested Hamilton East and Hamilton West electorates, and to Taupo, to campaign for the Party Vote. It is the Party Vote that will determine who has the privilege to form New Zealand&#39;s next Government. I hope to see you when I&#39;m out on the road around New Zealand soon.</p>

<p>Finally, for the record, National will NOT change the nuclear free legislation unless the public tells us to. National does NOT have Americans writing our policy or influencing our thinking. Helen Clark&#39;s spin machine is working overtime, the lights are blazing late into the night on the ninth floor of the Beehive, and Ministers are making all sorts of outrageous allegations with absolutely no evidence to back them up.</p>
