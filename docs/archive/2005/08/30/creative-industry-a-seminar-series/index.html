How would we know?</p>
<p>An interdisciplinary seminar series jointly hosted by the Stout Research Centre and the Victoria Management School will critically examine the creative industries, raising questions about definition, relationships, value and effects.</p>
<p>The seminar series will open on August 31 2005 and run weekly until 5 October at Victoria&#39;s downtown campus, Room GBLT4 in the Old Government Buildings, Lambton Quay (opposite Parliament Buildings).</p>

<p>This opening panel will range widely to address the emerging nature of work in the New Zealand creative industries: its social and economic viability, the support structures needed for success, and issues of work and employment such as education and training, career possibilities, working conditions and income levels.</p>
