<p>Youth Transitions</p>
<p>Labour’s Vision</p>
<p>Most of our young people leave school with a positive destination, and a firm plan for how to get there. An estimated 92 per cent of 15-to-19 year olds are engaged in some form of employment, education, or training. But we must keep intensifying our efforts for the 8 per cent who are still in danger of slipping through the cracks, and help them avoid a track that can lead to long-term unemployment and antisocial activity like crime.</p>
<p>That is why the Labour-led government and the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs adopted a shared goal of having all 15-19 year olds in work, education, training or another suitable activity by 2007.</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s Record</p>
<p>During the last two terms in government, Labour has:</p>
<p>• Established community-run Youth Transition Services in ten regions around the country to coordinate existing services to ensure young people don&#39;t fall through the cracks after leaving school.</p>
<p>• Introduced the Modern Apprenticeship scheme, creating work-based learning opportunities for close to 8,000 young people.</p>
<p>• Introduced the Gateway programme, designed to build pathways for senior secondary school students into work-based learning, and to encourage better partnerships between schools and local businesses.</p>
<p>During our next term in government, Labour will:</p>
<p>• Expand the Youth Transitions Service to cover all regions in the country. Each Service will involve government and community groups working in partnership to deliver services to 15 to 19 year olds leaving school without a clear pathway into work, training, or further education.</p>

<p>• Provide funding for an additional 5,000 Modern Apprenticeship places, taking the total number of Modern Apprentices to 14,000 in 2008</p>
<p>• Expand the Gateway programme to build pathways for senior secondary school</p>
<p>• Introduce a Youth Apprenticeships pilot, providing opportunities for young people to gain credits towards their apprenticeships while still at school<br>Forward. Together.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
