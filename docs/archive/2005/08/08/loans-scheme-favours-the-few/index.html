<p><strong>Monday, 8 August 2005, 9:02 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Loans scheme favours the few</p>
<p>“20% of student borrowers get 75% of the benefit from Labour’s irresponsible election-year interest free loans bribe,” according to figures released by National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>Mr English says based on Labour’s calculator, the numbers show that it’s expected taxpayers will meet an interest bill of more than $5.5 billion for existing student debt. This is based on conservative assumptions.</p>
<p>“A small number of students with large debts get the lion’s share of the gain.</p>
<p>“80% of borrowers owe less than $25,000. Their total interest bill for their debt is about $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>“The remaining 20% of borrowers owe more than $20,000. Their interest bill is about $4.3 billion.</p>
<p>“A borrower with a $12,500 loan will save $4,600 interest, while someone with a $52,500 loan will save $79,734 interest. That is 17 times as much.</p>
<p>“Taxpayers without student loans will paying for this irresponsible policy which provides an incentive for students to borrow more,” says Mr English.</p>
