<p>Industrial Unrest is Affecting Students</p>
<p>Lincoln University Students Association President, Andrew Gage said today that, even though Lincoln University’s Vice Chancellor, Roger Field did not think that current staff industrial action was having a major impact on the University; it was in fact significantly affecting students ability to learn effectively.</p>
<p>Mr Gage said that despite Mr Field’s claim today in the Press that the students still had access to library resources or services, that this was not actually the case. The disruption caused by striking staff outside the library today was far from being conducive to an effective learning environment.</p>
<p>“Today the library was not available for study, with staff telling students that they had to leave because the library was closed due to the industrial action and that they were not able to use the facility for study” Mr Gage said.</p>
<p>Mr Gage also stated that in regard to Mr Field’s statement, the Association did not think that giving student’s access to the library and IT services was in any way a replacement for lectures that they had not received.</p>
<p>“I am unsure as to what Mr Field thinks is a major impact on the university, but we feel that having an impact on students in any way is a major concern and so it should be the University’s.” Mr Gage said.</p>
<p>“Not knowing what classes, content or services will be affected, means that students are in a constant state of confusion and insecurity.” Mr Gage said.</p>
<p>Mr Gage stated that the Association and its members wondered if Mr Field had a real understanding of what was occurring and how it has been affecting students during this period of action.</p>
