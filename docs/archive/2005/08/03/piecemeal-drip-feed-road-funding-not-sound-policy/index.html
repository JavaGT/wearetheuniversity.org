<p>Maurice Williamson National Party Transport Spokesman</p>
<p>3 August 2005</p>
<p>Piecemeal, drip-feed road funding not sound policy</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s announcement of $150 million extra over the next 10 years for Bay of Plenty roads is a piecemeal, drip-feed way to fund roading and not sound policy, says National&#39;s Transport spokesman, Maurice Williamson.</p>
<p>He says he is pleased to see that Labour agrees with National that considerably more money needs to be spent on roads. &quot;But one-off announcements of largesse are not the way to fund roading,&quot; says Mr Williamson. &quot;National&#39;s policy of spending all the petrol excise tax on roads will mean two things:</p>
<p>* More money will be available for roading under National than under Labour, even after taking into account Labour&#39;s recent one-off add-ons.<br>* Having all the petrol tax going towards roading will allow certainty of funding for the future and allow contractors to build up their capabilities with confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s on-again off-again approach to road funding doesn&#39;t do any of that. &quot;This latest announcement, together with previous one-offs for Auckland and Wellington, is nothing more than political panic.</p>
<p>&quot;No doubt a Waikato package will be announced soon. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the much needed Waikato Expressway can now be funded by the Government within 10 years,&quot; says Mr Williamson.</p>
