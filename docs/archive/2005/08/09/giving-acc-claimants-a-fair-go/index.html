<p>Giving ACC claimants a fair go</p>
<p>The Green Party believes a full review of ACC is needed to ensure that all claimants get a fair go.</p>
<p>Green Party ACC spokesperson Sue Bradford, who released the Greens&#39; ACC policy this afternoon, said she had been working hard to try and improve the culture of ACC over the past three years, but much more needed to be done.</p>
<p>&quot;While we&#39;ve been supportive of Labour&#39;s renationalising of ACC, the Green Party believes there are many more improvements which need to be made,&quot; Ms Bradford said.</p>
<p>&quot;Above all, we need a change to the culture of ACC. Its primary focus should be the full vocational, health and social rehabilitation of injured people, not getting people off compensation as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re committed to protecting ACC from any attempts to privatise or partly privatise it, and we&#39;ll be seeking to ensure that ACC&#39;s culture becomes more conducive to helping Kiwis&#39; rehabilitate fully.&quot;</p>
<p>The Greens&#39; ACC policy includes:</p>
<p>- A full review of ACC, welfare and health and disability support systems in New Zealand;</p>
<p>* A review of ACC law so that a) cover remains as long as the original injury is still a causative factor in a claimant&#39;s current condition and b) the onus is on ACC to prove a claimant is no longer entitled to cover, before support is suspended or cancelled.</p>
<p>* Ensuring that people with genuine work-related gradual process injury, disease or infection, including chemical poisoning, or unexpected and unintended injuries as a result of medical treatment, can obtain ACC cover.</p>

<p>* Providing funding to independent advocacy groups who provide quality advocacy services for ACC claimants, as long as the need for such services exists.</p>
<p>* The creation of an independent ACC Ombudsman to take over the functions of the current ACC Complaints Investigation Service.<br>Ms Bradford will be launching the ACC policy when she speaks at an ACC claimants public meeting in Whangarei at 5.30pm today, Northland Disability Resource Centre, 40 John St, Whangarei.</p>
