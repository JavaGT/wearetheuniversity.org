<p>Deborah Coddington&#39;s Liberty Belle</p>
<p>The race is on and the lolly scramble has begun. The two old parties have started a bidding war for votes using Other People&#39;s Money (OPM). It&#39;s very easy to spend OPM, especially when you get lots of lovely votes in return.</p>
<p>Buying votes from tertiary students is easy so long as you have the OPM chequebook. National would write a cheque for a minimum (they say) of $70 million a year, in the form of tax rebates on student loan interest. Tax rebates sound like tax cuts but they&#39;re not. One man&#39;s tax rebate is another woman&#39;s tax increase. You can&#39;t have tax cuts and tax rebates at the same time. However, obviously National has abandoned its promise to give tax cuts because Don Brash said he&#39;d tell us what they&#39;d be &quot;a few days after the election date is announced&quot;. More than &quot;a few days&quot; have gone by and still no sign of National&#39;s tax cuts. I guess, like the little girl, we&#39;ll just have to wait.</p>
<p>Labour has dragged out a bigger fatter chequebook, however, and promises to write off interest on student loans for all students who remain in New Zealand. That&#39;s just about all students. Since student loans came into being, more than 550,000 New Zealanders have taken up a student loan. As of October 2004 less than five percent of those Kiwis were still overseas. Of all the graduates who travel overseas with student loans, more than two-thirds come home. So that brain drain is a myth. (I&#39;ve always hated that expression anyway - by implication it means those of us who stay are thickos and as I look around me every day in New Zealand I see intelligent, smart, energetic great people. Just because you don&#39;t have a tertiary qualification doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re stupid. Then again, I might be the exception to that little piece of wisdom.)</p>

<p>Labour says its policy will cost $300 million a year but Treasury papers released to me show that in 2000 Labour was warned that writing off interest on all student loans meant the government would have to find $4.5 billion dollars because of the extra take-up of those wanting to borrow. Interestingly, Treasury also showed how much money students could make if they didn&#39;t need a loan for fees, but took an interest-free loan anyway, and invested it. Heaps, man!</p>
<p>At the moment we spend nearly $12,000 per student on tertiary students. That&#39;s five times higher than per-student spending on early childhood education, yet the under-six years are the most crucial of a child&#39;s learning time. It&#39;s also 2.5 times higher than per- student spending on schools, including transport, special needs and other spending.</p>
<p>But hey, preschoolers, primary and most secondary students don&#39;t vote, so why should the OPM electioneering spenders care about them?</p>
<p>Yours in liberty,</p>
