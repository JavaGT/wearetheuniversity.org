<p><strong>Monday, 1 August 2005, 8:37 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>No cash windfall in student loan policy</p>
<p>Many students and their families wrongly believe Labour’s student loan policy means a cash windfall for them if they vote Labour, says National’s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>“I have spoken to parents and students who think they would be able to stop part-time work and focus on their studies if loans were interest free,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“In fact, a student with a $30,000 loan could wait more than 10 years to get any cash benefit from the policy.</p>
<p>“No borrower gets a cash benefit until their loan is fully paid off. Until then, borrowers would have to make the same compulsory payments each month under both National’s and Labour’s policies.</p>
<p>“Borrowers who have already paid interest for years and have nearly paid off their loans, as well as borrowers with small loans, will get a cash benefit sooner, but nothing like the thousands of dollars Labour has promised.</p>
<p>“In the meantime, every other taxpayer has to foot the interest bill. Why would voters support a policy that benefits a few in three election’s time, but costs everyone else right now?”</p>
