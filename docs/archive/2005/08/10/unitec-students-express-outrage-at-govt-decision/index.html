<p>Unitec students express outrage at Government’s latest decision</p>
<p>Unitec has had it’s application for University status denied by the Labour government.</p>
<p>President of the Unitec Student Union Robert Freeth says he is deeply disappointed over this decision.</p>
<p>“This decision, hot on the heels of their recent court loss, proves that the Labour government has its own agenda when deciding whether or not Unitec should become a university,” says Freeth.</p>
<p>The outcome of the court case proved that Associate Minister Steve Maharey unlawfully suspended Unitec’s university application, breached the laws of natural justice and breached the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.</p>
<p>“It seems that this government is determined not to grant Unitec University status, and I would be disturbed to think that a government would be prepared to advance their own agenda over the interests of students.” says Freeth.</p>
<p>“Following the student loan interest write-off election sweetener by the Labour Government, this decision will be a bitter pill for Unitec students to swallow.” says Freeth.<br>“It has been a long road for Unitec upon which the government has placed unlawful obstacles. Unitec will have to seriously consider their options before moving forward.” says Freeth.</p>
