<p>Urgent inquiry needed into Onehunga 111 fiasco</p>
<p>National’s Law and Order spokesman, Tony Ryall, wants an investigation into the Onehunga High School 111 fiasco.</p>
<p>A group of 15 ‘thugs’ armed with wood and a hammer terrorised the school, leaving the principal, a teacher, and a student injured.</p>
<p>&quot;The school principal says it took multiple phone calls and 25 minutes for police to get there. The police say it took 10 minutes.</p>
<p>&quot;The 111 system remains a weeping sore – the symbol of Labour&#39;s neglect of policing and safety.</p>
<p>&quot;This has been a dreadful and shocking act of violence. The public expect a rapid response. What went on here?</p>
<p>“National expects full disclosure by the authorities. In the past, complaints have been met with a wall of indifference. Urgent action is needed.</p>
<p>&quot;I daresay that if these thugs had been speeding from the school at 62 kilometres an hour, a police officer would have been there straight away,” Mr Ryall says.</p>
