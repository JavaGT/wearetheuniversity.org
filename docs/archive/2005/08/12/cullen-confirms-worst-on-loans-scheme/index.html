<p>John Key MP National Party Finance Spokesman</p>

<p>Cullen confirms worst on loans scheme</p>
<p>&quot;With a one-word answer Finance Minister Michael Cullen has confirmed our worst fears about the true cost of the student loans&#39; bribe,&quot; says National Party Finance spokesman John Key.</p>
<p>&quot;With the stroke of a pen the balance sheet will take a $1.7 billion hit in 2007. That&#39;s nearly five times the value of the personal tax tinkering offered by Labour in the Budget &quot;</p>
<p>In a written Parliamentary question, Dr Cullen answered &quot;yes&quot; when asked if the Government is required to report the student loan debt at fair value when the International Financial Reporting Standards come into force in 2007.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s increasingly clear why Labour did not want Treasury taking a look at this before the election and why Trevor Mallard attempted to bully the critics.</p>
<p>&quot;It amounts to a $1.7 billion transfer of wealth from the taxpayer to students, and that&#39;s before factoring in the increased borrowing which will occur.</p>
<p>&quot;It encourages students to borrow the maximum and repay the minimum, and the effect on the balance sheet shows this hadn&#39;t been properly thought through.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has been saying for months that there is no money for hard-working taxpayers. It is simply now insulting for them to expect ordinary working people to pay for this policy,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
