<p>UNITEC’S legal action will be at the expense of staff</p>
<p>TIASA, the union representing allied (non-academic) staff at UNITEC, has slammed as “financially irresponsible”, the decision by the Institutes management to seek a judicial review of the Government’s decision not to grant University status.</p>
<p>“While we can understand UNITEC’s disappointment that their University application has failed, their reaction with threats of further legal action, at a time when their staff are facing Institute-wide reviews which are likely to result in massive redundancies, is not in the best interests of staff ” said TIASA Chief Executive, Peter Joseph.</p>
<p>UNITEC have recently announced a major review, which is budget driven, and is expected to have a significant impact on staff, with more than 50 positions likely to be redundant.</p>
<p>“More money spent on legal battles with the Government will have an even greater impact on staff numbers and, as a consequence, on students”, said Peter Joseph. “This is an extremely stressful time for staff, and threats of costly legal action by UNITEC, which is likely to result in even greater job losses, is causing staff even more distress. UNITEC needs to demonstrate concern for their greatest asset – their staff”, said Mr Joseph.</p>
