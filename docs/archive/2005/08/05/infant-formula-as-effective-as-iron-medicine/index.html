<p>Study finds infant formula as effective as iron medicine in reducing anaemia</p>
<p>A trial by researchers at The University of Auckland’s Department of Paediatrics has found iron deficiency in young children can be treated as effectively with iron-fortified formula as it can with iron medicine.</p>
<p>The study involved 234 babies and toddlers aged between nine months and two years who had been hospitalised at Auckland’s Starship Hospital with acute infections.</p>
<p>An article about the study has been published in the on-line edition of the Archives of Diseases in Childhood, the official journal of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, and is due for print publication later this year.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Cameron Grant, who led the study, says many infants and children admitted to Starship with acute bacterial and viral infections such as pneumonia or gastro-enteritis, also have iron deficiency anaemia.</p>
<p>“Although our usual treatment is to prescribe iron medicine for three months, we know this treatment is not always followed through and the iron deficiency remains.</p>
<p>“Follow-on formula milk has the advantage of becoming a normal part of the child’s daily diet and has the additional benefits of containing other micro-nutrients that these sick young children need.</p>
<p>“The formula is easier to give to children than iron medicine which can cause stomach upsets, diarrhoea and constipation,” he says.</p>
<p>In the study, carried out in collaboration with researchers from Massey University, one third of the children were given the usual iron medicine, one third were given iron-fortified toddler follow-on milk and the final third were given iron-fortified, partially-modified cows milk.</p>
<p>After three months it was found that the proportion of babies with iron deficiency anaemia decreased significantly in all three groups, with the iron follow-on formula as effective as the iron medicine.</p>
<p>Iron deficiency has a number of adverse effects on health. These include impaired learning, reduced weight gain, impaired absorption of nutrients and decreased ability to exercise.</p>
