<p>Labour fails New Zealand children</p>
<p>National Party Welfare spokeswoman Judith Collins says Labour has proved it is unable to stop the abuse of our most vulnerable children.</p>
<p>She is commenting on figures showing the number of children put into care and protection placements has increased by 47 per cent since 1999.</p>
<p>As at 30 June 2005, there were a total of 4,847 children in care and protection placements, compared with 3,292 at 28 February 1999.</p>
<p>“Labour has budgeted to spend almost $30 million on the Families Commission over four years,” says Ms Collins.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, many thousands more of our most vulnerable children are falling into the hands of the state. That’s why National is putting parental and personal responsibility at the core of its welfare and justice policies.</p>
<p>“This isn’t just about giving CYF the resources they need to do the job. This is also about properly equipping parents, including those on welfare.</p>
<p>“Labour has proved yet again that they are all talk and big spending, and no action for our children.</p>
<p>“The best way to keep these kids out of the system is to promote a culture where parents are expected to be responsible. For those depending on the taxpayer for financial support that should mean things like making sure their children attend school, stay out of trouble and get regular health and dental checks.</p>
<p>“Of course, none of this means children should not be removed from abusive situations. Youth suicide rates are still unacceptably high by world standards, child poverty continues to be a significant issue and beneficiary numbers are projected to rise over the next four years if Labour continues down this track.</p>

<p>“After six years, the need for a change of government is clear,” says Ms Collins.</p>
