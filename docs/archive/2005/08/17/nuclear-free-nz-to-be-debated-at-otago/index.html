<p>Nuclear-free NZ to be debated at Otago</p>
<p>Politicians from the main political parties will take the stage to debate the pros and cons of New Zealand’s nuclear-free stance in an OUSA-organised forum this Friday.</p>
<p>Pete Hodgson (Labour), Conway Powell (National), Rod Donald (Greens), Ken Shirley (ACT), Dail Jones (NZ First), and Gordon Copeland (United Future) will defend their parties’ nuclear policy and address issues like the viability of nuclear power in New Zealand, and the foreign policy costs and benefits of our nuclear-free stance.</p>
<p>Friday’s forum will be held at 1:30pm in the Otago University Union Building, and will be preceded by a “Wet Lunch” performance by local band Chihuahua.</p>
<p>Otago University Students’ Association President Steven Sutton described the combination of lunchtime concert and political forum as “exciting”, and said he hoped that it might attract people who might not otherwise attend a political event.</p>
<p>“All in all, we expect a lively audience turnout on the day” said Mr. Sutton. “A potential Chernobyl of a debate, rather than a mere Three Mile Island.”</p>
<p>The nuclear forum is the first in a series of pre-election events planned by OUSA, with similar debates on the environment, tax, and education to follow.</p>
