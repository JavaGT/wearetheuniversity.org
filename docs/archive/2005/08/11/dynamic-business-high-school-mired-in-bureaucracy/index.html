<p><strong>Thursday, 11 August 2005, 11:20 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Dynamic Business High School Mired in Government Bureaucracy</p>
<p>Dr. Jackie Blue, National candidate for Mt. Roskill, will join the Hon. Bill English at the Onehunga High Business School on Tuesday 16 August. Jackie and Bill will arrive at 3.30 pm and spend two hours visiting with the students and teachers.</p>
<p>The Onehunga High Business School was established to assist secondary school students develop the knowledge and skills to become tomorrow&#39;s business leaders. Both candidates are keen to show their support for this innovative new educational institution. They sympathise with the difficulty it has had under the current Labour government.</p>
<p>&quot;When the school opened, the Labour government, and the Prime Minister in particular, pledged their support but they have failed to deliver&quot; noted Jackie. &quot;With around 320 students keen to become the entrepreneurs of tomorrow, you would think that a government serious about education and the development of business would make more of an effort.&quot;</p>
<p>The school opened in 2002, and yet despite 3 years of effort it has been unable to obtain Ministry of Education support for inclusion of Business Studies in the senior secondary curriculum. This is despite amazing support for the school from businesses, NZ Trade and Enterprise, parents and television and print media. Ministers, such as Trevor Mallard, publicly supported the school during its high-profile launch. However, they have done little since then to assist the school through the bureaucratic quagmire created by this Labour government.</p>
<p>National has pledged itself to support innovative and emerging institutions that will build a better future for New Zealanders. The business community is confident that the Onehunga High Business School is such an institution. A National government will work to remove the bureaucracy that stifles this creativity.</p>
