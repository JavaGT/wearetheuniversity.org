<p>Report: No accountability for NCEA exams</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English says a select committee report into the setting of NCEA exams shows there is a lack of accountability for the way NCEA exams and exam questions are set.</p>
<p>The report is the result of an inquiry into political bias at the NZQA after an NCEA Level 1 History question asked students to choose two of three people from whose perspective they were to write: two prominent Maori leaders - Dame Whina Cooper and Eva Rickard - and &#39;A National Party Member of Parliament not sympathetic to Maori concerns&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;In my view, this particular question showed a clear bias,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only was the question factually incorrect but it relied on unfair, left-wing stereotypes of the National Party.</p>
<p>&quot;However, even more disturbing is the fact that no one person is accountable for exam questions and the NZQA has tried very hard to avoid accountability altogether.&quot;</p>
<p>The select committee report comes on top of a damning report into 2004 NCEA exams.</p>
<p>Mr English says both reports show the NZQA needs a dramatic change in attitude before it is up to the job of overseeing our national secondary schools qualification.</p>
<p>&quot;The select committee report has highlighted arrogant attitudes and loose process that has led to unfair assessment for students sitting the NCEA.</p>
<p>&quot;The select committee has done students a favour by trawling through the detail of how exams are set and pointing to a need for more scrutiny and accountability.&quot;</p>
