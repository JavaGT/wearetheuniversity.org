<p>Greens Co-Leaders launch Dunedin campaign this weekend</p>
<p>The Dunedin Green Party&#39;s 2005 election campaign will be officially launched this weekend, with the arrival of both of the Party Co-Leaders over the next four days.</p>
<p>Rod Donald arrives today to campaign with the local Green team, and Jeanette Fitzsimons arrives on Monday for two days in Dunedin.</p>
<p>In addition to a number of speaking engagements, Mr Donald will be launching the campaign by canvassing with the Party&#39;s two Dunedin candidates - Philippa Jamieson and Peter Thomlinson - this afternoon.</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons will be meeting with a number of groups on Monday and Tuesday. She will also be delivering a key speech in the national campaign on Monday night in Dunedin, on the Greens&#39; plan to prepare for the end of cheap oil. This speech will be at a public meeting being held at 7.30pm in Archway 3, University of Otago Campus, Cnr of Union St East &amp; Leith Walk.</p>
<p>&quot;Our campaign for the party vote in Dunedin will be focusing on our key messages of a cleaner environment, a fairer society, safe, sustainable energy and healthier food and people&quot;, said Ms Jamieson, the Greens&#39; Dunedin North candidate.</p>
<p>&quot;Another important aspect to the campaign will be educating voters about the MMP system and how they need to think carefully about their two votes. If voters want a Labour-led government with a strong support partner in the Greens, then they need to party vote for the Green Party this election,&quot; said Mr Thomlinson, the Greens&#39; Dunedin South candidate.</p>
