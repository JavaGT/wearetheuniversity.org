<p>New Zealand for New Zealanders</p>
<p>New Zealand should be a country for Kiwis, including new migrants, not foreign investors who hardly ever set foot on our soil, the Green Party said today in launching its foreign investment policy.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has a responsibility to ensure that its foreign investment rules mean that Kiwis don&#39;t become serfs and servants in their own land,&quot; Green Co-Leader Rod Donald says.</p>
<p>&quot;The Green Party welcomes new migrants who enrich our nation, but we&#39;re not interested in international speculators who want to rip us off and treat New Zealand as a plaything. If you want to buy a slice of heaven, you need to make New Zealand your home.&quot;</p>
<p>The Foreign Investment policy (attached), which Mr Donald is launching at Otago University this afternoon, includes:<br>- Halt further land sales to foreign investors.<br>- A tightening of the rules for other foreign investments in buildings, businesses and aquaculture by applying a National Interest Analysis to all proposed investments of more than $10 million where the foreign shareholding is more than 10 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The Green Party welcomes &#39;greenfields&#39; foreign investments that create jobs and bring new technology to New Zealand,&quot; Mr Donald says. &quot;What we don&#39;t want is asset-strippers who buy up iconic businesses and bleed them dry.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government refuses to face up to the fact that its open-door policy on land sales is artificially inflating the price of all properties, including residential housing. It&#39;s not just the family farm or the bach at the beach that is out of reach - first-home owners are now losing out to foreign investors too.</p>

<p>&quot;There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that overseas investors, particularly Australians, are buying up residential property at the low-end of the market. This is adding to the woes of first-home buyers who can&#39;t compete against these cash-rich interlopers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Even the Government recognises it is a privilege for foreign companies to own sensitive New Zealand assets.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s why the Greens believe foreign owners should be required to conform to a code of corporate responsibility or risk losing the privilege of owning assets here. This is to ensure we do not have a repeat of debacles such as the run-down of Tranz Rail and the Telecom rip-off.&quot;</p>
