<p>The Mapp Report - Labour Lies</p>
<p>Until yesterday Labour said there was no money for tax cuts - yet another Labour lie.</p>
<p>The deceitfulness of the Labour government has no limit. Since July, they knew they had the money. They have deliberately delayed the opening of the books that is required before the election - so they could practice the dark art of sectional politics.</p>
<p>As with all their election bribes, they have picked on particular groups to give them the benefits of taxpayer largesse.</p>
<p>This is the real choice facing voters. Do you favour the politics of division, sectionalism, and blatant bribery, or do you believe that all New Zealanders should be treated fairly, and that they all should be able to keep more of their own money?</p>
<p>John Key announced the size of National&#39;s tax package today. On Monday the detail of the actual package will be announced.</p>
<p>National has already announced a 30c business tax, to match Australia. We have also announced tax deductions for student loans and for childcare costs. On Monday, the announcement will focus on personal income tax; the tax that every New Zealander pays on their income. This is the very point Labour ignores. The money is actually first earned by New Zealanders. Labour&#39;s plan is simply socialist redistribution packages.</p>
<p>National&#39;s package recognises that the money belongs to people who earn it, and that taxation should be kept within reasonable bands, not just for the benefits of a rapacious state.</p>

<p>A PRACTICAL PLAN FOR THE ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>What kind of country do we want to leave for our grandchildren? Obviously more prosperous, with more choice. But also, a country where we retain our treasured landscapes, clean beaches and vibrant native forest.</p>
<p>On the surface, New Zealand does pretty well but look closer and there are some real environmental problems, ranging from the central North Island lakes suffering from nitrate poisoning, to destruction of native forest by possums, to continuing erosion of East Coast Hill country, to increased air pollution in Auckland.</p>
<p>Dealing with these problems requires practical solutions. The Left is all too keen on appealing to emotions, but often take refuge in State heavy-handed regulation as the answer.</p>
<p>National&#39;s approach is more pragmatic, and is intended to work with people to achieve an outcome. Much of the pollution of the lakes arises from more intensive use of land by dairy farming. Fonterra has adopted a clean dairy policy. In particular, this means reducing stock access to vulnerable stream banks, and allowing a buffer of natural vegetation to filter run-off into streams. It makes sense to provide sensible initiatives for farmers to fence off streams. Farmers are having to give up productive land; they at least should receive an environmental grant of money to be able to under take the work. One can imagine this could be ideal work for idle people on the dole.</p>
<p>Tree planting has dramatically reduced from 40,000 hectares per annum in the 1990s to 10,000 hectares at present. Yet tree planting is exactly what is needed on highly eroded farmland on the East Coast. It will reduce the severity of floods, and generally assist in cleaning up waterways. These have the added advantage of acting as a carbon sink. Labour had relied on tree planting to reduce the impact of Kyoto, but their own policies have dramatically reduced the forestry industry. Again, practical incentives are required in order to increase the planting of sustainable forestry.</p>
<p>In Auckland, increased car numbers and congestion has been contributing to increased air pollution. Cleaner diesel including bio-diesel would be a good start. (Bio-diesel is made out of tallow, a by-product from our freezing works which produces cleaner fuel). Vehicle emissions are not really in the control of consumers. It is simply not possible to go out and buy emission kits. They have to be built into the car by the manufacturer. New Zealand is the only OECD country that does not have effective emission controls on cars. It is highly unlikely that every other developed country is wrong, and that New Zealand is right on this issue, despite the musings of Thursday&#39;s Herald editorial.</p>
<p>Since New Zealand does not actually make cars, it would be logical to adopt the internationally recognised standards which apply in countries that do actually make cars. A cleaner vehicle fleet would make a real difference to our air quality.</p>
<p>The Auckland Regional Council argues that 250 people WILL have shortened lives as a result of air pollution - though the difficulty proving that has made the figure somewhat suspect. Nevertheless, it seems logical that reducing air pollution will improve overall health. It is time to take practical steps to clear up the worst polluting vehicles.</p>
<p>National&#39;s commitment to the environment is to provide practical measures that will make a real difference to our quality of life.</p>
<p>LABOUR LIES: # 5</p>
<p>MYTH# 5 : Labour has said there is no money for tax cuts Truth: Labour has deliberately concealed the increased tax flows over the last month. There has always been enough money for a tax cut, which Labour now admits!</p>
