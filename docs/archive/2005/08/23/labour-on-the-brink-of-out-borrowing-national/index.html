<p>John Key MP<br>National Party Finance Spokesman<br>23 August 2005</p>
<p>Labour on the brink of out borrowing National</p>
<p>“Wild claims by Michael Cullen that National will lead New Zealand into a pathway of debt are about as accurate as his statement that there’s no room for tax relief,” says National Party Finance spokesman John Key</p>
<p>“If Labour continues on current form, it’s quite possible Labour will be borrowing more than National and getting less for it.</p>
<p>“At National’s financial briefing last Friday, we indicated that gross debt could be as much as $3.3 billion higher than Labour’s forecast by 2008/09.</p>
<p>”However, National has not factored in the stronger revenue the Treasury predicted in its pre-election opening of the books, which is estimated to reduce this borrowing requirement by around $2.2 billion.</p>
<p>“In addition, Michael Cullen’s cancellation of interest on student loans will increase Labour’s borrowing by around $1 billion. Add to this the additional $1.5 billion from the increased Working for Families.</p>
<p>“National’s gain from the PREFU, and Labour’s loss from the loans alongside its WFF initiative, means the borrowing gap between the alternative governments is less than $700 million.</p>
<p>“With Labour still threatening to spend more taxpayer money, and having refused to consider any behavioural change in students who will get interest free loans - it’s almost certain Labour will end up borrowing more than National.</p>
<p>“Only National has a considered plan to lift after tax incomes, and grow prosperity in New Zealand,” says Mr Key.</p>
