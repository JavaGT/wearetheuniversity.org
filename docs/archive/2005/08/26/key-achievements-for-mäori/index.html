<p>- Over 40,000 more Mäori are now in work than at the same time in 1999.</p>
<p>- The number of Mäori on the unemployment benefit has halved (from 44,000 in December 1999 to 22,500 in December 2004)</p>
<p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>- Mäori Fisheries Act transferred control of around $750 million in assets and quota to Mäori</p>
<p>- Mäori Business Facilitation Service (MBFS) has assisted over 4,000 clients, since September 2000..</p>

<p>MAORI CULTURAL EXPRESSION</p>

<p>- The Mäori Language Strategy was revised to reflect the growing security of the language in the modern world.</p>
<p>- The Toi Iho brand was launched in February 2002 in response to several decades of Mäori calls for a way of identifying authentic quality Mäori arts.</p>
<p>- There has been a significant investment in iwi broadcasting to enable Mäori radio stations to meet the expectations of Mäori audiences.</p>
<p>TREATY SETTLEMENTS</p>
<p>Labour has made great progress on Treaty settlements. This includes:</p>
<p>- eight deeds of settlement signed between the Crown and iwi</p>
<p>- seven Settlement Acts passed into law</p>
<p>- four Agreements in Principle signed between Crown and iwi. Deeds of Settlement have been reached with a number of groups that the previous National government couldn’t reach agreement with, such as Ngati Awa, Ngati Tuwharetoa ki Kawerau, Ngati Tama and Ngati Ruanui. Dialogue continues with more than 26 groups – this is evidence of more and more groups wanting to focus on resolving grievances and moving forwards.</p>
