<p><strong>Friday, 26 August 2005, 12:51 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>John Key MP National Party Finance Spokesman</p>
<p>26 August 2005</p>
<p>Was Helen Clark trying to mislead NZers on loans?</p>
<p>National Party Finance spokesman John Key is questioning why the Prime Minister chose to misrepresent the real size of the student loans bribe when she announced the package.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, when she knew that even at $300 million the figure was far too light, did she say in her press statement of the same day it would cost only between $100 million and $300 million.</p>
<p>&quot;If the $100 million figure is the number for only part of the first year, why did she choose to include it in the announcement?</p>
<p>&quot;One obvious conclusion is that Helen Clark was attempting to mislead New Zealand taxpayers about the true cost of the policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s been all over the place on this issue.</p>
<p>&quot;First there was no Treasury advice, then there was.</p>
<p>&quot;First it was $100 million, then it was $300 million, and now Michael Cullen tells us Treasury&#39;s first costings put the price tag at nearly $400 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Party is calling on Dr Cullen to release the Treasury advice on the loans scheme, and wave the usual stand down period for official information,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
