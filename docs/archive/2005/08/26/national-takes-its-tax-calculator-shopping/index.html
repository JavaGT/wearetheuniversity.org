<p>National takes its tax calculator shopping</p>
<p>The National Party is taking its enormously popular tax calculator to shopping malls and other public places throughout New Zealand tomorrow.</p>
<p>“The reaction to our programme for fair tax has been extremely positive. Most people at the workplaces I’ve visited this week have been telling me they’ll be much better off with National and our policies which will reward hard work and enterprise,” says Dr Brash.</p>
<p>After three days, there had been 2.4 million hits on National’s tax calculator, <a href="http://www.taxcuts.co.nz">www.taxcuts.co.nz</a> . It’s a simple operation for users to load in the relevant details including their income, student loans and the number of children they have, if any.</p>
<p>“Now we’re taking the calculator on the road. So more people can see first hand, just how they’ll get ahead with National.”</p>
<p>National is to set up ‘fair tax stands’ at more than 50 locations throughout the country, from Kerikeri in the North to Invercargill in the South</p>
<p>National Party Leader Don Brash and Finance spokesman John Key will be on hand to demonstrate the calculators for shoppers in Auckland’s St Lukes Mall on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>“Most New Zealanders know there is ample room for tax relief. After six years under this Labour Government it’s time for the overtaxation to stop,” says Dr Brash.</p>
<p>On Monday, National unveiled a tax package that will put more money in the pockets of more than two million workers, and lower tax rates on extra work.</p>
<p>Tax on extra work at the average wage will fall from 33% to 19%.</p>
<p>“If we want an economy with First World infrastructure, First World healthcare and education, then we have to provide the right incentives for productivity and enterprise.</p>
<p>“National’s comprehensive package of principled tax relief does just that,” says Dr Brash.</p>
