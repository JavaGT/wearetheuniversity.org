<p>Strengthening Child and Adolescent Mental Health Research</p>
<p>University to Further Strengthen Child and Adolescent Mental Health Research<br>The University of Auckland&#39;s Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, is to further strengthen its expertise in child and adolescent mental health research, thanks to a donation from the Rotary Club of Downtown Auckland.</p>
<p>The donation has led to the establishment of The Rotary Club of Downtown Auckland Child and Adolescent Mental Health Research Fund.</p>
<p>The deputy dean of the faculty and head of psychological medicine, Professor Rob Kydd, says the fund will enable overseas academics with expertise in research into, and treatment of, mental health issues to be brought to the faculty.</p>
<p>&quot;It will enable us to build important research links with overseas universities in the area of child and youth mental health and allow us to keep abreast of latest treatment programmes, for the benefit of all New Zealand,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a small dedicated team of researchers working in key areas such as youth depression - one of the key risk factors in teen suicides, identifying effective treatment programmes, and looking at the delivery of these to improve outcomes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Rotary Club of Downtown Auckland has been very supportive of our activities in this area over the years, and this latest generous donation will allow us to further build on this. I know they have run various fund raising events for this, and we would also like to thank all those organisations and individuals who contributed to those activities.&quot;</p>

<p>The immediate past president of the Rotary Club of Downtown Auckland, Mr Greg Moyle said his club recognised children&#39;s needs were different from adults and had been supporting the University for several years.</p>
<p>&quot;We recognise both the importance of enhancing the mental health needs of our children and young people, and the difficulties in gaining support and funding for this work.&quot;</p>
