<p><strong>Thursday, 25 August 2005, 3:41 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Wayne Mapp MP National Party Industrial Relations Spokesman</p>
<p>25 August 2005</p>
<p>Strike action out of control</p>
<p>National&#39;s Industrial Relations spokesman, Wayne Mapp, says Labour&#39;s union-friendly employment relations law has caused strike action to become out of control.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has given unions too much power, and consequently they are using and abusing it,&quot; says Dr Mapp.</p>
<p>This week&#39;s strike action includes:</p>
<p>* Dominion Breweries workers<br>* Mental health workers<br>* Nurse Maude staff in Canterbury<br>* Fuji-Xerox photocopier technicians<br>* Fairfax community newspapers in Wellington<br>* Clinical psychologists in Wellington</p>
<p>&quot;National warned this could happen under the new industrial laws passed last year, and it has come to pass.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe it&#39;s time the unions woke up to the fact that under Labour there is no extra money for most working New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;That is why National&#39;s tax package is so important. Virtually all New Zealanders will get a substantial tax cut - and the incentive to get ahead. Most workers get to keep more than $4 out of every $5. Under Labour, one dollar in three is spent by the rapacious nature of the state.</p>
<p>&quot;Only National will deliver what these workers are striking for. And only National will restore balance into workplace relationships so that New Zealanders won&#39;t be at the mercy of strikes, week in and week out,&quot; says Dr Mapp.</p>
