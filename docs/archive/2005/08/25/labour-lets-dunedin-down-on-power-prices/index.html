<p>Labour lets Dunedin down on power prices</p>
<p>National Party Leader Don Brash says Labour&#39;s rush to impose a new carbon charge on householders will hit places like Dunedin particularly hard.</p>
<p>He made the comments during a visit to Dunedin today.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past three years, the average annual power bill paid by Dunedin residents has climbed by more than $300.</p>
<p>&quot;Before he revealed his billion-dollar Kyoto miscalculation, Pete Hodgson optimistically said the carbon charge would cost each household about $4 per week.</p>
<p>&quot;Those on fixed incomes, including students and superannuitants, will face this new cost. Under National they won&#39;t.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course the carbon charge will also force fuel prices higher, which will hit businesses particularly hard.</p>
<p>&quot;And when transport costs keep going up as they have, the prices paid by consumers will inevitably rise.</p>
<p>&quot;For Dunedin, this means people, it means profits and it means wages and salaries.</p>
<p>&quot;And for householders it also means paying more for their own power and petrol.</p>
<p>&quot;The voters of Dunedin must hold Pete Hodgson to account. He was warned that Labour&#39;s rush to ratify Kyoto would end up costing New Zealanders their jobs, and would put us at a competitive disadvantage with many of our trading partners.</p>
<p>&quot;And it could get even worse. Labour&#39;s preferred coalition partner wants to add more tax to diesel and it wants to increase the carbon charge.</p>
<p>&quot;Householders concerned about rising power prices have only one choice this election. Give your vote to National and stop the carbon tax,&quot; says Dr Brash.</p>
