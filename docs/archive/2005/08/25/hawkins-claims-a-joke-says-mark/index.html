<p>Hawkins Claims A Joke Says Mark</p>
<p>New Zealand First law and order spokesperson Ron Mark says Police Minister George Hawkins’ claims that Labour has poured more resources into police staffing and police equipment than any other government are an absolute joke.</p>
<p>Mr Mark’s comments follow a press release issued by Hawkins today in which he states that the drop in recorded crime is a result of the added resources provided to them by Labour.</p>
<p>“How can the Minister make these claims when we have a chronic shortage in frontline staff and public confidence in police is at an all time low?</p>
<p>“How can the Minister brag about a reduction in recorded crime when he has delivered us a 111 crisis, staff shortages, escalating gang violence, violent crime, drug use and growing immigrant crime?</p>
<p>“The Minister should know that police numbers need to be increased by thousands, not hundreds, and if he was serious about providing police with the resources they need to fight crime he would have sought ten times the number of extra officers he has promised,” said Mr Mark.</p>
<p>“A reduction in reported crime in no way indicates a reduction in actual crime rates.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First is the only party that can be trusted to double police numbers and ensure that the police force will have the frontline resources and powers they need to fight crime and keep our communities safe.</p>
<p>“We will address the real crime rates and the real problems police are facing,” said Mr Mark.</p>
