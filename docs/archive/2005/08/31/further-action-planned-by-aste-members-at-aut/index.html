<p>Further Action Planned by ASTE Members at AUT</p>
<p>Lecture theatres were empty yesterday as striking lecturers from Auckland University of Technology picketed the University. They then met for three hours to discuss further action over their stalled pay talks. Irena Brorens, Assistant Secretary for ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa, said today that ASTE members planned further disruption to classes over the coming weeks if the Vice Chancellor of the University does not make an improved salary offer. “Members reaffirmed yesterday that industrial action will continue because the current offer, of 3.5% and 3.5% over two years is not acceptable”, Ms Brorens said.</p>
<p>She went on to say that the current campaign of withdrawal of goodwill would now begin to affect the University’s recruitment, marketing and promotional activities. “The University relies on our members’ goodwill in all of these areas”, Ms Brorens said</p>
<p>She went on to say that members would also begin a programme of lightening strikes across the University beginning immediately.</p>
