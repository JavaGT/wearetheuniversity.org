<p>Desperate Labour re-announces cancer funding</p>
<p>National Party Health spokesman Paul Hutchison says Labour&#39;s desperate attempt to woo voters by re-announcing cancer funding regionally will not work.</p>
<p>Labour announced its Cancer Control Action Plan in March, saying &#39;the plan includes nearly $6 million to top up existing palliative care, support and rehabilitation, and $4 million more for cancer treatment drugs&#39;.</p>
<p>A media release from Helen Clark today said: &quot;The money is Canterbury DHB&#39;s share of nearly $6 million extra for hospices and $4 million for extra drugs&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly, Labour is running desperately low on ideas, and is planning to re-launch most of its Budget announcements regionally,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour made the announcement in March. Three months down the track a few bad opinion polls come along and, in desperation, Labour has resorted to regurgitating its own funding announcements.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter how many times the same money is announced, Labour&#39;s massively bureaucratic, inefficient wasteful health system will not look any better,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
