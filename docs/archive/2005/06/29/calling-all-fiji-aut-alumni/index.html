<p>Calling all Fiji AUT alumni</p>
<p>AUT is calling all Fiji-based graduates to join the Fiji AUT Alumni Chapter, being launched on 1 August 2005 in Suva. The Fiji chapter will join the university&#39;s worldwide Alumni Network.</p>
<p>All graduates from AUT, AIT, ATI and Seddon Memorial Technical College are invited to attend this inaugural event hosted by AUT&#39;s Office of Alumni Relations. People wishing to register for this free event and join AUT&#39;s Alumni Network can contact Alumni Relations on telephone +64 9 921 9029 or email <a href="mailto:fiji.alumni@aut.ac.nz">fiji.alumni@aut.ac.nz</a>.</p>
<p>AUT Bachelor of Business graduate Mele Kunatuba Nalaukai, who currently works for Fiji Islands Revenue &amp; Customs Authority (FIRCA) in her homeland of Fiji says by joining the worldwide Alumni Network graduates will gain a sense of belonging to New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;No matter where in the world you are, you will always have a connection to New Zealand,&quot; she says. &quot;This is the chance to network with fellow AUT alumni globally. It will breed new opportunities to connect with other countries.&quot;</p>
<p>Mele says the Fiji alumni connections will pave the way to the future for everyone. &quot;We&#39;ll be seeing the benefits for years when people want to send their kids to AUT, or to help local kids in the neighbourhood travel abroad for further studies. &quot;You have nothing to lose, just a whole lot of connections to gain. Join up!&quot; She says it is also an excellent opportunity to catch up with old friends.</p>
<p>Over the years, hundreds of students from Fiji have graduated from AUT or its predecessors. The Fiji chapter will develop social networking events and benefits for locals with the support of the Office of Alumni Relations.</p>
