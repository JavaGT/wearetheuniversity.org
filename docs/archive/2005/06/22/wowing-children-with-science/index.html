<p>A student enjoys himself inside a zorb, or special plastic capsule for rolling around in. Children will be able to enjoy zorbing as part of the Incredible Science festival on Monday July 11.</p>
<p>A spectacular chemistry magic show, “smashing”Smarties and the adrenalin rush of “zorbing” are just some of the activities children can enjoy these school holidays at The University of Auckland’s Incredible Science day.</p>
<p>Incredible Science, which is targeted at primary and intermediate school children, will be held on Monday, July 11 and aims to excite children and capture their interest in science.</p>
<p>Faculty of Science Dean Professor Dick Bellamy says New Zealand’s playgrounds house the potential scientists and innovators of the future, and Incredible Science aims to harness that potential by wowing children with science.</p>
<p>“If we can foster a child’s interest in science at a young age, we can provide New Zealand with the scientists required to grow the knowledge economy in the future.</p>
<p>“Many of these children are interested in science and some already have skills in areas like computer science and technology. We want to show them that science can be fun and that’s what Incredible Science is all about,” says Professor Bellamy.</p>
<p>Incredible Science is hosted and organised by the Faculty of Science and will include a diverse range of hands-on activities, lectures, shows and displays.</p>

<p>Highlights include a Wow Physics Show, finding out how to produce simple computer games and 3D illusions, glass blowing and lectures on everything from a journey to Pluto and why volcanoes erupt.</p>
<p>A feature of the programme this year will be the launch of “Incredible Science” - the book, which includes a number of interesting science topics, facts, and easy to follow step-by-step experiments that can be done at home.</p>
<p>Last year, some 6000 children, parents and school teachers attended Incredible Science and numbers are expected to increase this year.</p>
<p>Incredible Science programmes have been distributed to schools, and parents can also collect a programme and get further information by calling 0800 61 62 63 or visiting the website, <a href="http://www.auckland.ac.nz/science">www.auckland.ac.nz/science</a>.</p>
<p>Registration is not required. All activities on the day are free, but children must be accompanied by an adult.</p>
