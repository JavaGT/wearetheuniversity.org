<p>Environment Waikato out of control</p>

<p>It’s little wonder that our investment in new forests has diminished to a small fraction of the former levels and that large forestry companies are looking to leave New Zealand, ACT MP Ken Shirley said today.</p>
<p>“The decision by Environment Waikato in respect to a land use consent to harvest epitomises the nonsensical barriers confronting forestry in New Zealand,” Mr Shirley said.</p>
<p>“In declining the application, Environment Waikato stated the following:</p>
<p>“Felling and extracting mature pine trees had the potential to adversely affect wahi tapu or other traditional values and to disturb, damage or destroy archaeological sites yet to be discovered”.</p>
<p>“It’s clear to any person that such conditions prohibit any development or harvest. One could also extrapolate the same condition to prohibit any farmer from ploughing a field. It’s time that Labour took a much stronger position and spelt out clearly in legislation that this sort of nonsense must go.</p>
<p>“With this sort of decision, it’s no wonder forest owners are choosing not to plant new forests and our commitment to the Kyoto Protocol is in deficit. The erosion of property rights must be one of the biggest disincentives for investment in the productive sector in New Zealand. Environment Waikato is clearly out of control.</p>
<p>“One can only hope that Crown Forests will appeal this decision and that the courts will expose the nonsense for what it is,” Mr Shirley said.</p>
