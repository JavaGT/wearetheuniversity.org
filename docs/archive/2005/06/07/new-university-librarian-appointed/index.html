<p>New University Librarian appointed</p>
<p>A highly experienced and respected librarian has been appointed to the position of University Librarian at the University of Otago.</p>
<p>Suzanne Pharo has been the University of Waikato Librarian since 1996, and prior to that spent more than 10 years as the Tauranga City Council and the Tauranga District Council Librarian.</p>
<p>The University of Otago Academic Deputy Vice Chancellor, Professor Gareth Jones, says the University is incredibly fortunate to get someone of Ms Pharo’s calibre.</p>
<p>“This is an extremely important role within the University and requires someone with extensive knowledge as well as leadership abilities.</p>
<p>“Ms Pharo certainly fills those criteria, having held senior positions in both academic and community libraries,” he says.</p>
<p>“Clearly she is also a leader within her profession having spent five years as the chair of CONZUL, the Council of University Librarians.”</p>
<p>Ms Pharo is also a founding member of CONZULSys, a groundbreaking project to purchase and manage an Information Resource Management System.</p>
<p>“I am really delighted to be coming to Dunedin to such a prestigious University and library,” Ms Pharo says.</p>
<p>“The challenges of the future in the library and information arenas are very lively and exciting. One of the things I like about Otago is that it is known for being leading edge.”</p>
<p>Ms Pharo will take up her new position on 22 August, replacing Michael Wooliscroft who retired in April after having been University Librarian since 1987.</p>
<p>Her qualifications include a Masters in Public Policy from Victoria University, a New Zealand Library Association Certificate and a BA from the University of Auckland.</p>
