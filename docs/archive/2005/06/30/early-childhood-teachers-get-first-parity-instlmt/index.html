<p>Media Release<br>June 30, 2005<br>From NZEI Te Riu Roa<br>For Immediate Use</p>
<p>Early Childhood Education Teachers Receive First Pay Parity Instalment</p>
<p>A thousand teachers working in more than 170 early childhood education centres throughout the country will take a step towards obtaining pay parity with primary and secondary teachers tomorrow.</p>
<p>They belong to NZEI Te Riu Roa which last year negotiated a collective employment agreement delivering a four step pay rise that will see them obtain pay parity with teachers working in schools and kindergartens by July 2008. Tomorrow they receive the first of those four pay rises.</p>
<p>The teachers, who are covered by the Consenting Parties Collective Agreement, will receive pay rises tomorrow that range from 2.4% to 12%. The highest increases will go to those who have degree qualifications and those who are hold positions of responsibility in their early childhood education centres.</p>
<p>The money for the increases was provided by the Government in this year&#39;s Budget.</p>
<p>When the final pay parity rise is delivered in July 2008 the salary for a teacher with eight years experience and a bachelors degree in early childhood education will have risen from $37,600 to $56,400, a 50% increase.</p>
<p>&quot;Delivering pay parity to these early childhood education teachers recognises that the work they do is as important as their colleagues in primary and secondary schools and should be given equal value,&quot; NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Colin Tarr.</p>
<p>&quot;This is backed up by research that shows children who receive a quality early childhood education perform better at school and carry the benefits into adult life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The research also shows that the key to providing quality early childhood education is to staff centres with qualified and registered teachers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;NZEI acknowledges the investment the Government is making in funding pay parity for early childhood teachers and in helping centres employ registered and qualified teachers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This will pay huge dividends that will benefit the whole country,&quot; says Colin Tarr.</p>
