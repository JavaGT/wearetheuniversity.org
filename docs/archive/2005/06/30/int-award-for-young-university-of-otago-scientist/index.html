<p>International Award for Young University of Otago Scientist</p>
<p>A University of Otago Department of Physics PhD student, Robert McCormick, has won a prestigious Young Scientist Award from the International Union of Radio Scientists (URSI).</p>
<p>He is one of a select group of 100 young scientists from around the world selected to attend, and the only one from New Zealand. The award will allow him to attend the URSI General Assembly in New Delhi in October, a major three yearly conference that attracts thousands of scientists.</p>
<p>Robert’s PhD supervisor Dr Craig Rodger, himself a past recipient of the award, says it is a great opportunity.</p>
<p>“It is a well-deserved chance for Robert to attend one of the major scientific meetings of our field,” Dr Rodger says.</p>
<p>“He will interact with many young scientists of different nationalities, as well as meet with the greyer members of the established community. This will be good for his research, for his career, and for him as a person.”</p>
<p>Robert’s PhD research revolves around developing a computer model to simulate the propagation of radio waves and how they are affected by changes in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>This would complement the work being done by Dr Rodger’s research group, which is examining how events such as solar flares and various forms of lightning can drive atmospheric changes and the global climate system.</p>
<p>Robert says the award means he can attend a major conference, which he otherwise wouldn’t be able to get to.</p>
<p>“It will be a great chance to talk to others in the field about what I am doing and where I am going, as well as perhaps meet people who could be future collaborators in my field of research.”</p>
<p>He will make a ten to fifteen minute presentation on his work and will also get to attend a special reception for the young scientists hosted by the President of India at the Presidential Palace.</p>
<p>It is the second time Robert has received a prestigious award previously received by his supervisor, having also received the Hatherton Award from the Royal Society.</p>
