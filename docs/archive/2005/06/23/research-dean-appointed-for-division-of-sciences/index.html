<p>Research Dean appointed for Division of Sciences</p>
<p>Dr Gary Wilson of the Geology Department has been appointed Associate Dean of Research for the Division of Sciences.</p>
<p>Pro Vice Chancellor for Sciences, Vernon Squire says this is a new position, created to facilitate and encourage the expansion of high quality research within the Division.</p>
<p>“The research funding environment has changed a lot, and I felt that as a division we needed someone to keep abreast of those changes, to optimise our success in funding rounds, and to make all the processes involved easier for our many talented researchers.”</p>
<p>Dr Wilson says the University as a whole needs to develop a more strategic approach to research.</p>
<p>“We have one of the strongest research capability bases in the country, but we haven’t been good at acquiring external funding support for the research,” he says.</p>
<p>“My vision is to develop a research programme at the University of Otago which commands funding, rather than repeatedly reorganising applications to match changing funding streams. It needs to be capability-driven rather than opportunity–driven.”</p>
<p>As well as funding, Dr Wilson says the most successful researchers need a multi-talented team around them to ensure on-going research success: logistics in arranging the practicalities, administrative, technical and research support are all essential. They also need a system that allows them the time and freedom to be research active and productive.</p>
<p>He feels that his experience in a range of different research environments gives him an edge in providing support to researchers, having worked in a Crown Research Institute, taught in three different university systems in the US, the UK and New Zealand, and as a “soft-funded” researcher in a research institute in the US.</p>

<p>“My short term plan is to put resources into improving grant-writing success in areas where, traditionally, we’ve not been successful. Then, I want to look at the overall funding environment and develop a strategic plan for world class research and research capability in Sciences,” Dr Wilson says.</p>
<p>This is precisely in line with Pro-Vice-Chancellor Vernon Squire’s reasons for appointing him in the first place: “I see in Gary someone who is not afraid to say what he thinks. He’s energetic and very capable, and I’m predicting that he will be able to work out a solid strategic development path for Science research.”</p>
<p>Professor Geoff White, Deputy vice Chancellor for Research says &quot;Gary&#39;s vision for Sciences is highly consistent with the direction for the whole University, and his appointment is very welcome&quot;.</p>
<p>The position is the equivalent of one day a week, and Dr Wilson takes this up on top of his high-profile research for the Andrill Project, his paleomagnetic research programme, supervising a team of PhD students, and somehow spending time with his young family.</p>
