<p>Hon Bill English National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>23 June 2005</p>
<p>Another Mallard flip-flop</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English says he welcomes Trevor Mallard&#39;s latest policy change on school holidays.</p>
<p>Mr Mallard today announced that he will not proceed with his proposed &#39;tournament week&#39;, a one-week break in the middle of the third term, beginning next year.</p>
<p>&quot;The holiday was never going to work for parents. Thousands of families would have had to take time off work or leave their children unsupervised,&quot; says Mr English</p>
<p>&quot;Schools and teachers didn&#39;t want it either.</p>
<p>This was a personal hobby-horse for Mr Mallard, but like most of his other &#39;good ideas&#39;, a rush of blood to the head is quickly followed by cooling his heels after the inevitable backdown.</p>
<p>&quot;The demise of &#39;tournament week&#39; comes hot on the heels of his partial backdown over school bus funding.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s amazing what a couple of bad polls can do to get a Labour Party Minister to listen to his sector.</p>
<p>&quot;We can expect further backdowns in the next few weeks on his radical restructuring of polytechs and private training establishments.</p>
<p>&quot;This Minister is well and truly past his use-by date and the education sector is ready for a change,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
