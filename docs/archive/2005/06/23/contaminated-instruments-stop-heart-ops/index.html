<p>Paul Hutchison National Party Health Spokesman</p>
<p>Contaminated instruments and no parking stop heart ops</p>
<p>Health Minister Annette King has failed to do anything effective to prevent the slow down of heart operations in four out of five DHBs, says National&#39;s Health spokesman, Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>The number of heart operations at the Auckland, Waikato, Capital and Coast, and Canterbury DHBs were significantly less in 2003/4 than the year before.</p>
<p>&quot;In Auckland, the situation is compounded by the sterile supply system, which has attracted attention because human tissue was found on supposedly sterile instruments.</p>
<p>Dr Hutchison revealed in Parliament today that despite last month&#39;s report, &quot;grossly contaminated instruments&quot; are still appearing from sterile supply, wrecking operating lists, delaying operations and leaving critically ill heart patients to languish in wards without treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;Annette King was unable to tell Parliament why more than $250,000 worth of heart surgery is being lost per week at ADHB.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is specialist teams frequently stand idle because nurses cannot park onsite, and many are not prepared to bus from Greenlane where parking is available.</p>
<p>&quot;The ADHB continues to be riddled with problems, even though it has been under intense monitoring for more than a year.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a damning indictment on Labour that despite putting $3.5 billion extra into health over the past five years, four out of five DHBs are performing less heart operations,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
