<p>Senator puts saving trees ahead of Greens&#39; conference</p>
<p>Australian Green Party Senator Bob Brown has had to pull out of this weekend&#39;s New Zealand Green Party Annual Conference in Christchurch to go to court to save a Tasmanian forest, Co-Leader Rod Donald says.</p>
<p>Dynamic, young Australian Green Senator Kerry Nettle will take the place of Senator Brown, who is in court trying to gain an injunction against Forestry Tasmania&#39;s logging operations at Wielangta in Australia&#39;s Federal Court in Melbourne.</p>
<p>&quot;We applaud Bob for his dedication and wish him all the best in his case and are grateful Kerry can step in a at such short notice,&quot; Mr Donald says.</p>
<p>Saturday&#39;s programme kicks off with a video address from Walter Reid one of the main authors of the recently released UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. He is followed by Senator Nettle and a keynote address by Co-Leader Rod Donald. The party&#39;s top 15 candidates will then be introduced.</p>
<p>Other speakers for Saturday&#39;s programme have been confirmed. They are Council of Trade Unions president Ross Wilson and head of the New Zealand Nurses&#39; Organisation Laile Harre.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon the Party will release its Student Support Policy, which will contain the party&#39;s strategy for tackling New Zealand&#39;s growing student debt mountain. New Zealand University Students&#39; Association Co-President Andrew Kirton will speak at the launch.</p>
<p>Greens Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons will give her keynote address on Sunday morning. The other speakers for Sunday have already been announced.</p>
<p>Almost 200 people have registered to attend the conference.  </p>
