<p>$1.25 million for partner violence study</p>
<p>A proposal to evaluate the effectiveness of partner violence screening in women has been approved by the Health Research Council to the tune of $1.25 million.</p>
<p>Lead researcher and AUT Associate Professor Jane Koziol-McLain, Dr Janet Fanslow of Auckland University and Dr Emma Davies from AUT&#39;s Institute of Public Policy will use the funding to carry out the 36-month study entitled: Healthcare site-based partner violence screening and intervention efficacy. Associate Professor Koziol-McLain says that professional and governmental organisations recognise the significant health risks posed by violence inflicted on women and their children by partners.</p>
<p>&quot;These organisations recommend that women be screened for violence and subsequent health effects when they present to clinics, hospitals and emergency wards. &quot;Whether healthcare site-based screening and intervention can reduce morbidity and mortality, however, remains untested.</p>
<p>The current study addresses this need,&quot; she says. During the first phase of the study women who have experienced abuse will meet with researchers and clinicians to develop a randomised controlled trial to test the effectiveness of healthcare site-based partner violence screening and intervention.</p>
<p>&quot;By involving women who have been affected by violence in the design of the study, the researchers hope to get an accurate measure of the effectiveness of screening and intervention, while holding women and children&#39;s safety paramount,&quot; says Associate Professor Koziol-McLain. The second phase of the research will involve implementing the screening and intervention procedures, then measuring health and safety outcomes for women and children.</p>
<p>Other successful AUT researchers in the funding round were Associate Professor Mihi Ratima, Belinda Ihaka and Greg Coyle of the Division of Public Health and Psychosocial Studies. They will conduct a 24-month study of diabetes-related lower limb pathology control demonstration intervention for Maori and will receive $469,690.</p>
<p>Professor Kathryn McPherson, also of the Division of Rehabilitation &amp; Occupation Studies will be the lead researcher on a 12-month study worth $107,908 entitled: Goal setting in rehabilitation: two new approaches in acquired brain injury.</p>
