<p>ACT on Campus today criticised the threatened action by university staff to withhold student marks in their bid to win pay increases.</p>
<p>ACT on Campus President, Michael Collins, questioned why the staff unions were rushing to treat students as though they are pawns in an industrial dispute.</p>
<p>“Why is it that students who have worked hard in their studies are being subjected to a game of brinkmanship over which they have no control? If staff want an increase in pay they need to talk to their employers a bit more and not involve students in their dispute.”</p>
<p>Collins was also critical of student unions that rushed to support the move.</p>
<p>“It’s sadly ironic that the same student unions who congratulate themselves for invoking price controls like the fees freeze and fee maxima are now prepared to punish students for those policies’ results –under funded Universities and underpaid University staff.”</p>
<p>“We have a situation where a student union, the Waikato Student’s Union, has endorsed this action. The Waikato union is a compulsory membership union for those studying at Waikato University and they can only get 2% of students to turn out in a vote. It’s absolute rubbish when they say students support the measure.”</p>
<p>“Student unions and lecturers should realise that it would be easier to provide resources, including higher pay rates for staff, in a high growth, low tax economy. ACT on Campus is the only voice in the student body pointing to these basic, widely accepted economic principles.”</p>
<p>“How about the student unions start sticking up for their members and rail against this move which will see many students in limbo over their results?”</p>
