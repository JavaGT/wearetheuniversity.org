<p>University staff deserve a multi-employer agreement</p>
<p>The breakdown today of talks between university staff and vice-chancellors was a disappointing outcome, Green Tertiary Education Spokesperson Nandor Tanczos says.</p>
<p>&quot;Getting a multi-employer agreement is about ensuring the quality of university education in New Zealand,&quot; Nandor, who supports the staff&#39;s call for a multi-employer agreement, says.</p>
<p>&quot;Staff salaries continue to lag significantly behind comparable countries and need to be addressed with some urgency if we want to continue to retain good academics.&quot;</p>
<p>Nandor welcomed the Government&#39;s proposal for a Universities Salaries Group, to investigate and resolve long-recognised salary problems in the sector, but said it needed to go further.</p>
<p>&quot;Government funding to tertiary institutions does not meet the actual cost increases and so puts pressure on student fees. The Government needs to ensure some certainty around funding for staff salaries, so both university employers and students can be assured they will have a stable environment in which to work.</p>
<p>&quot;While we support the campaign by university staff for better salaries and working conditions, we hope that any strike action will not badly affect university students.&quot;</p>
