<p>University negotiations break down</p>
<p>Negotiations for new national collective employment agreements between university unions and vice-chancellors have broken down. Universities will now, for the first time ever, face prolonged national strike action.</p>
<p>The negotiations, which resumed in Christchurch today, broke down after all of the university employers maintained their previous refusal to agree to national collective agreements, insisting on single-employer agreements with salary increases ranging from 2.0 percent (Massey) to 4.5 percent (Auckland). Some of the universities have also now initiated single-employer bargaining.</p>
<p>Combined university unions’ spokesperson, Jeff Rowe, said that the unions had hoped that vice-chancellors would respond positively to an offer by the Government, made last week, to establish a Universities Salaries Group to investigate and resolve long-recognised salary problems in the sector. “The unions had proposed an interim settlement to these negotiations which would have facilitated the opportunity for the parties to find long-term solutions to the salary issues faced by universities,” he said. “The employers’ rejection of our position, and their luke-warm support of the Government’s proposal lead us to question their commitment to resolving these issues at all.”</p>
<p>Association of University Staff General Secretary, Helen Kelly, called on university councils to now step into the dispute, saying it was an important governance matter. “That the vice-chancellors are jeopardising a significant opportunity to work constructively with the Government and unions to find solutions should be of major concern to councils,” she said. “Even if vice-chancellors are prepared to risk the long-term quality and reputation of New Zealand universities, their councils should not.</p>
<p>The unions will hold meetings over the next week to consider escalating industrial action, already proposed to start on 20 July.</p>
