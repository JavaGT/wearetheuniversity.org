<p>Nurse Managed Health Centres Key Primary Health Tool</p>
<p>Nurse managed health centres, staffed by qualified nurse practitioners, could form a key part of, and improve equality of access to primary health care services in New Zealand, says University of Auckland School of Nursing academic Professor Frances Hughes.</p>
<p>Dr Hughes says that while there are still only a few nurse practitioners in New Zealand, the United States has had them for decades, and they play a key role there in community based health services.</p>
<p>&quot;Their nurse managed centres provide an incredible array of essential health care services to people in their communities, including disease prevention, primary health care and health promotion.&quot;</p>
<p>This week three leading American proponents of nurse practitioners will visit the Auckland&#39;s School of Nursing to exchange information about their role in community based settings.</p>
<p>The visitors, Tine Hansen-Turton, Director of the National Nurse Managed Health Centre, Donna Torrisi, Director of the Falls Family Practice and Counselling Network, and Professor E Sullivan-Marks from the University of Pennsylvania have received Eisenhower and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation fellowships to come to New Zealand to further the work of the International Nurse Practitioner Consortium.</p>
<p>They will be in New Zealand for one month visiting other centres around the country.</p>
<p>Dr Hughes says nurse managed health centres in the United States have played a key role in reducing inequalities in health care and are regarded as essential safety net providers.</p>
<p>&quot;These centres provide accessible high quality and comprehensive health care to people who have trouble accessing care, particularly rural, low income, minority, homeless and migrant populations.&quot;</p>
