<p>Girls Meet Women Science Graduates</p>
<p>Media Release<br>28 June 2005</p>
<p>GIRLS MEET WOMEN SCIENCE GRADUATES</p>
<p>Girls can do anything! That&#39;s the message that will be promoted at The University of Auckland&#39;s WISE Futures&#39; evening this week.</p>
<p>Secondary school girls who are considering studying the sciences will have a chance to talk through their career options with successful women graduates at the Faculty of Science on Thursday June 30.</p>
<p>Programme organiser and Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) Equity Advisor, Ros Smart, says the evening is designed for Year 11-13 girls to give them more information on what a career in the sciences involves.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a fantastic opportunity for girls who are interested in science but aren&#39;t really sure what their career options are. They will be able to meet role models who have studied science and are now applying it in their careers.&quot;</p>
<p>The keynote speaker for the evening is Carron Blom, an Environmental Scientist at Beca, a major engineering consultancy. Carron will discuss why she studied science and provide students an overview of the diverse range of career options available.</p>
<p>The girls will hear addresses from a number of women who are working in fields such as computer science, forensics and physics. Speakers will share their reasons for choosing a science career, benefits, challenges, and strategies for success.</p>
<p>One of them who will speak at the evening is Olivia Samson, a scientist in the Institute of Environmental Science and Research&#39;s (ESR) Crime Sample Database Unit.</p>

<p>Ms Samson, who holds a Masters in Forensic Science from The University of Auckland, interprets and reports DNA analysis results from crimes such as burglaries and car thefts.</p>
<p>&quot;I enjoy my job immensely and in addition to being very interesting, I find it rewarding knowing that I&#39;m contributing to a safer community.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Samson says she is looking forward to sharing her experiences with secondary school students.</p>
<p>&quot;Ever since I can remember I was going to study science at university. During school holidays, I attended science camps run by the local university and polytechnic and this gave me an insight into the numerous career paths that science provided. Through the WISE Futures&#39; programme, I hope a new generation of girls will become interested in science.&quot;</p>
<p>The evening will also include an overview of Faculty of Science programmes available at The University of Auckland and a tour of the laboratory facilities.</p>
<p>WISE Futures is based on a similar successful programme used in Australia and Ms Smart says it is equally popular with school students here.</p>
<p>WISE Futures runs from 5.00pm to 8.30pm on Thursday, June 30. Parents and teachers are welcome to join students. Registration via school careers advisors is necessary to attend the evening.</p>
