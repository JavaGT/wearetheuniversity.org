<p>Solution proposed for traffic issues at SH1 at Waitati</p>
<p>CONSULTATION WITH RESIDENTS VITAL</p>
<p>Otago MP David Parker has proposed two potential solutions to the traffic issues confronting the Blueskin General Store on State Highway 1 at Waitati, north of Dunedin.</p>
<p>In a recent letter to Waitati residents Mr Parker has proposed:</p>
<p>1. Reducing the speed limit to 70 kmph; or</p>
<p>2. Realigning the road, with Transit New Zealand compensating the existing business and making available a safer site on the Waitati township side of the road.</p>
<p>Mr Parker wrote to Waitati residents about the traffic issues concerning the intersection/turn off to Waitati and the adjacent Blueskin General Store in response to a recent local petition.</p>
<p>“Even prior to the serious accident which occurred adjacent to the store over the Christmas period, Transit New Zealand had identified that this corner is a dangerous black spot with a history of accidents,” Mr Parker’s letter to residents said.</p>
<p>“The accident undoubtedly lends weight to Transit’s concerns. Nevertheless the Blueskin General Store is important to the local community. It is a considerable distance to other shops. Further, I believe that there is a strong case that petrol should be able to be purchased locally, especially since the Evansdale petrol pumps closed down,” the letter said.</p>
<p>Mr Parker told residents he was advocating for the issue to be resolved in one of these ways. He said it was important that residents were a part of the consultation process in deciding what to do about the traffic issues in their community.</p>

<p>“I am aware that Transit and the operators of the Blueskin General Store are involved in a planning process, which may bring these issues to a head. In the meantime I have made a submission on Transit New Zealand’s Ten year state highway plan in support of the second option. You can view my submission on my website at <a href="http://www.labour.org.nz/davidparker">www.labour.org.nz/davidparker</a>.</p>
<p>Mr Parker asked residents with further concerns to contact him.</p>
