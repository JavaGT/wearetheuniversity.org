<p>Maori Party Announces List<br>Matariki Launch,</p>
<p>The Maori Party is today delighted to announce a list of sixty-two candidates, a list which represents the face of our future.</p>
<p>“We must take bold action to build the nation of tomorrow” said Party President, Professor Whatarangi Winiata. “It is for that reason that we have taken seriously the need to give voice to those who will make up our future – those who represent our diversity as a nation, a nation of many peoples”.</p>
<p>“Included in our list are tangata whenua, pakeha, pasifika peoples, Chinese. Other ethnic communities have also expressed a desire to work closely with us on further policy development” stated Professor Winiata.</p>
<p>“It also demonstrates the commitment our candidates have given to enacting Te Tiriti o Waitangi, particularly renown Treaty practitioner and author, Robert Consedine, and former Waitangi Tribunal director Morrie Love”.</p>
<p>“We are delighted with the inclusion of rangatahi at all levels of the party, and are thrilled that in our top forty, we have five outstanding candidates under the age of forty” stated Tariana Turia, co-leader of the Maori Party. “We are particularly excited to have top Olympic ski champion Simon Wi Rutene, and environmentalist Glenis Philip-Barbara in our top five. Our youngest candidate is only 19 years old (Tell Kuka).”</p>
<p>“The skills, strategic experience and knowledge of the candidates standing for the Maori Party has blown us away” stated Dr Pita Sharples, Co-leader of the Maori Party.</p>
<p>“Our top forty include a number of company directors, the chief executive of a national organisation to advance literacy in Aotearoa (Bronwyn Yates), chief executives of community education, a former President of the Maori Women’s Welfare League (Aroha Reriti-Crofts), the former chief advisor of Maori health, (Dr Tony Ruakere) and a huge range of entrepreneurial talent”.</p>
<p>“Included in the expertise are auditors for quality standards in health (Te Orohi Paul) and tertiary education (Dr John Harre), managers of services across a range of District Health Boards, and leading edge specialists in areas such as; commercial and customary fisheries (Ngahiwi Tomoana), resource management, forensic psychiatry (Charles Joe), organic horticulture, violence prevention (Daryl Gregory), and peak oil (Anne FitzSimon).</p>
<p>The list also includes union delegates, business mentors, social service workers, expert practitioners in health, organic horticulture, peace and social justice; teachers at kohanga, kura, wananga and across mainstream schools, writers, performers, a music producer and audio engineer (Solomon Matthews) and a national champion of tae kwon do (Brett Cowan)”.</p>
