<p>Green candidates to campaign for the Kiwi OE vote</p>
<p>The Green Party will run a strong campaign for overseas votes in this year&#39;s election by standing list candidates in Sydney and London, says Co-Leader Rod Donald.</p>
<p>The Greens stood a London-based candidate in 1999 and 2002 and one in Sydney last election.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks to our overseas candidates at the last election the Greens won 14.2 percent of the &#39;OE vote&#39;,&quot; said Mr Donald, &quot;that was more than twice the level of support in New Zealand itself&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m therefore pleased to announce that Sydney-based James Diack has been selected to campaign in Australia for the Party Vote. A candidate in Britain will be announced soon.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that our high level of support overseas reflects the fact that Kiwis living abroad have seen how crowded and polluted cities can be and so recognise that New Zealand&#39;s environment and heritage are unique and precious and deserve preservation and enhancement.</p>
<p>&quot;For many on their OE, the Greens&#39; new tertiary student support policy, which proposes to wipe one year of a graduate&#39;s debt for every year they work in New Zealand, will have particular resonance. Young Kiwis overseas are often &#39;debt exiles&#39; who have been forced to leave because of the burden of compounding student debt.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if that wasn&#39;t the major reason they went offshore, many soon find it becomes a high hurdle in the way of returning. Our policy aims not just to stem the brain drain, but reverse it by providing a clear incentive to come home sooner rather than later,&quot; said Mr Donald.</p>

<p>James Diack lives in inner city Sydney where he works as an office manager and political education worker for the New South Wales Greens. He has been a volunteer and activist for a number of progressive Australian organisations for the last five years, including the Sydney Social Forum and Critical Mass.</p>
<p>James will be taking the Green message to numerous Kiwi events across the Tasman in the coming weeks. The 30-year-old is registered to vote in Christchurch Central and will be ranked 31st equal on the Greens&#39; Party List.</p>
