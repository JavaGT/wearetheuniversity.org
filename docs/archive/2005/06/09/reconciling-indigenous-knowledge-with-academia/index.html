<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>9 June 2005</p>
<p>Reconciling indigenous knowledge with academic priorities</p>
<p>The tension between indigenous peoples keen to preserve their traditional knowledge and the rigours and demands of academia is to be explored in a major conference to be held at Victoria University later this month in June.</p>
<p>Indigenous Knowledges: Reconciling Academic Priorities with Indigenous Realities will be held at Victoria University’s Pipitea Campus from 22–25 June. The conference, which is being organised by He Parekereke, in the University’s School of Educational Studies, and is supported by Government-funded Centre of Research Excellence, Nga Pae o te Maramatanga (the National Institute of Research Excellence in Maori Development &amp; Advancement).</p>
<p>Senior Lecturer Dr Joanna Kidman (Te Arawa, Te Aupouri), Co-Director of He Parekereke, says indigenous peoples face significant challenges in the 21st Century.</p>
<p>“In the face of globalisation, indigenous peoples are facing rapid social, political, environmental and economic change that is challenging cultural identities and traditions. New research methods and academic practices have begun to evolve within indigenous communities, which in turn present new questions and challenges for conventional academic scholarship and practice.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Kidman says the conference aims to promote discussion and interaction between academics and indigenous communities in different disciplines and different nations.</p>
<p>“The conference will draw indigenous peoples from around the world to discuss matters of academic scholarship and its importance to the everyday lives of indigenous people. There is a strong, positive focus on the future and to that end we also organising a symposium to showcase the best research talent from young and emerging Maori researchers across New Zealand.&quot;</p>
