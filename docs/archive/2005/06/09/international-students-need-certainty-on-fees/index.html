<p>International students need certainty on fees</p>
<p>The Greens are congratulating Waikato University for guaranteeing international students their fees won&#39;t increase for the duration of their studies and are urging the Government to direct other tertiary providers to follow suit.</p>
<p>The Waikato University Council announced last night that it was to reintroduce &quot;grandparenting&quot; for international student fees, which means that those students can be sure their fees won&#39;t rise while they&#39;re studying.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a welcome acknowledgement that international students come to New Zealand with a certain budget and often cannot cope with escalating fees,&quot; Green Tertiary Education Spokesperson Nandor Tanczos said.</p>
<p>&quot;This decision will give international students going to Waikato certainty about how much their education here will cost them.</p>
<p>&quot;Far too often, international students are forced into desperation and poverty because universities jack up their fees from one year to the next. It&#39;s great to see Waikato joining AUT and Massey in addressing this problem.&quot;</p>
<p>However, Nandor said the Government had to acknowledge that grandparenting was needed across all universities and polytechnics.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time for the Government to direct all universities and polytechnics to introduce grandparenting. This will require some minor legislative change, but it&#39;s just plain wrong that most of our tertiary institutions to continue to hit up international students for more and more money each year to the detriment of their wellbeing.&quot;</p>
