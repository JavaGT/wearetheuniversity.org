<p><strong>Thursday, 9 June 2005, 9:46 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Finally, fee security for International Students at Waikato University</p>
<p>The Waikato University Council voted today to re-introduce grand-parenting for international student fees. Grand-parenting means that international students can be assured that the level of fees charged for the duration of their study will not increase.</p>
<p>“International students at Waikato University have worked long and hard for fee grand-parenting. They will be delighted with this major win,” said Camilla Belich, Co-president of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>“In the past, many international students have lived in impoverished conditions or have had to stop studying because of huge increases in their student fees,” Belich said.</p>
<p>“We are disappointed that the introduction of fee grand-parenting was coupled with a sharp 7.41% fee increase for international students but grand-parenting will goes a long way towards treating international students as human beings and not cash cows for their institutions,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of NZUSA.</p>
<p>“We encourage all tertiary institutions to follow the lead of Massey University, AUT and now Waikato University and immediately introduce fee certainty for international students,” said Kirton.</p>
