<p>Maori Party Candidate Pledges Support to Wananga Council</p>
<p>Maori Party candidate for Tainui Angeline Greensill has pledged the full support of the Maori Party in the fight to keep its reigns in Maori hands.</p>
<p>In a letter to council chairman Craig Coxhead, Trevor Mallard has said he thought the council should be dissolved and a commissioner appointed.</p>
<p>The Party is considering calling on its 17,000 members to come out and support of the Wananga, which the Party calls a taonga Maori. We can be a formidable force.</p>
<p>“Te Wananga is probably the largest single kaupapa Maori organisation in the country,” said Greensill. “We will not sit back while the government tries to take control and reduce it to a minor player in education.”</p>
<p>Ms Greensill has taken on board the issue because the Wananga started its 20 year history in the heart of Tainui. Te Wananga has its roots in the building of a marae at Te Awamutu College.</p>
<p>“If the Council needs support from the Maori community in 21 days then I say let’s call on our members to hit the streets for the kaupapa.”</p>
<p>The Party also has concerns over the so called $20 million loan from the government to Te Wananga.</p>
<p>“Te Wananga is a Maori success story like we’ve seen recently in rugby, golf, netball and dancing. It even makes the government look good with so many more Maori in tertiary education.”</p>
<p>In an election year, we think the government is treading dangerously if it thinks it can wind back our success without consequences.</p>
<p>The Maori Party in Tainui will start planning this week in ways that they can actively call on members to show their support for the Wananga in a coordinated way.</p>
