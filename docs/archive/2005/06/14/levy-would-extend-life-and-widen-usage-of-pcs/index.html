<p>&#39;E-waste&#39; levy would extend life and widen usage of PCs</p>
<p>Green Party Waste-free Spokesperson Mike Ward is calling for a deposit on new computers to stem the flow of &#39;e-waste&#39;.</p>
<p>Australian NGO Environment Victoria last week reported that only one in four computers across the Tasman are being recycled and that the production of a typical PC uses as much fossil fuel, chemicals and water as that of a mid-sized car.</p>
<p>&quot;If the ecological impact of the manufacture of a computer is really as great as that of a car, a levy is needed to ensure that they are being used as long as possible and that the materials are then recovered,&quot; said Mr Ward.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a move would also turn the tens of thousands of computers New Zealanders throw away each year into a potential bonanza. There are a number of community enterprises restoring computers and making them available to schools and low-income families, but it is a largely a labour-intensive activity and most struggle to stay in the black.</p>
<p>&quot;A levy would ensure the viability of such recycling and solve a major part of the e-waste problem. It could be accommodated within the Government&#39;s Digital Strategy, which at present makes no mention of the ultimate fate of the computer hardware that it aims to encourage more people to use.</p>
<p>&quot;Computers are great, but like all modern inventions they need to be used responsibly and in moderation. The current regime of planned obsolescence is ecologically irresponsible and ultimately counter-productive. If these machines were designed so they could be more easily and economically maintained, their useful lives could be extended and second or third-hand use would become more common, meaning more low income people could get access to them and be able to become more computer literate.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ward&#39;s Waste-free private member&#39;s bill provides for levies through its extended producer responsibility mechanisms.</p>
