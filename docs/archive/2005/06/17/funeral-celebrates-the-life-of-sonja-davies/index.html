<p>All sing ‘Bread and Roses’ as Sonja leaves the Town Hall</p>
<p>Bread and Roses<br>As we go marching, marching, in the beauty of the day,<br>A million darkened kitchens, a thousand mill lofts gray,<br>Are touched with all the radiance that a sudden sun discloses,<br>For the people hear us singing: Bread and Roses! Bread and Roses!</p>
<p>As we go marching, marching, we battle too for men,<br>For they are women&#39;s children, and we mother them again.<br>Our lives shall not be sweated from birth until life closes;<br>Hearts starve as well as bodies; give us bread, but give us roses.</p>
<p>As we go marching, marching, unnumbered women dead<br>Go crying through our singing their ancient call for bread.<br>Small art and love and beauty their drudging spirits knew.<br>Yes, it is bread we fight for, but we fight for roses too.</p>
<p>As we go marching, marching, we bring the greater days,<br>The rising of the women means the rising of the race.<br>No more the drudge and idler, ten that toil where one reposes,<br>But a sharing of life&#39;s glories: Bread and roses, bread and roses.</p>
<p>Our lives shall not be sweated from birth until life closes;<br>hearts starve as well as bodies; bread and roses, bread and roses.</p>
