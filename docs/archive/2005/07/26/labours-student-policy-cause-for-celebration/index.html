<p><strong>Tuesday, 26 July 2005, 2:40 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour’s Student Support Policy Cause for Celebration</p>
<p>The release of Labour’s student support policy in Wellington this afternoon was described as “a cause for celebration” by Otago University Students’ Association President Steven Sutton.</p>
<p>“Labour has today announced meaningful steps towards dealing with New Zealand’s student debt crisis” said Mr Sutton.</p>
<p>Labour promised that, if elected, they would wipe the interest on student loans for graduates who stay in the country, and increase access to student allowances so that half of all students receive financial assistance while studying.</p>
<p>“This is huge” said Mr Sutton. “Finally, after years of student pressure, a major party has admitted that student debt is out of hand, and is actually going to take action instead of just filing it in the “too-hard” box.”</p>
<p>“Wiping the interest on graduate debt is a massive step towards easing the burden on graduates who remain in the country. It will make staying in New Zealand a viable option for thousands of young people who would otherwise be driven overseas.”</p>
<p>“Increasing access to student allowances is also an essential measure, and we call on Labour to continue down this path until no student has to borrow to pay rent or to put food on the table. Only then will we see the end of the student debt crisis.”</p>
<p>Labour also promised to introduce measures to provide “fee certainty” to students while studying, and conduct a specific investigation into the funding for medical and dental students, something Mr Sutton described as “reassuring news for Otago’s most indebted students”.</p>
<p>More information on student fees should be provided when Labour announce their tertiary education policy later in the ear, but students can now look forward to this announcement with optimism, said Mr Sutton</p>
