<p>Radical Student Loan Plan Eases Debt Burden for Thousands of Workers</p>
<p>Labour’s policy of interest-free student loans promised far more to those paying off loans than National’s miserly plan for tax rebates on interest paid, Council of Trade Unions vice-president Helen Kelly said today.</p>
<p>Labour’s tertiary policy says no interest will be charged on student loans while those with loans stay in the country.</p>
<p>“Anyone who thinks they would be better off with a tax rebate is dreaming,” Helen Kelly said.</p>
<p>“National is offering a small tax break that is inequitable because it benefits those who can afford to pay off the most,” she said. “Labour’s policy is a radical move that will ease a huge debt burden on many thousands of New Zealanders.”</p>
<p>The policy would help to keep much-needed skilled workers in the country and be fairer on women.</p>
<p>“Women take twice as long as men to repay their student loans - because they are often paid less than men - and therefore pay thousands of dollars more in interest.</p>
<p>“Today’s announcement is a light at the end of a long tunnel for a huge number of workers who are struggling to pay their student loan, save for their retirement, buy their own home and provide for their families.”</p>
