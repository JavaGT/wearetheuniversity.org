<p><strong>Tuesday, 26 July 2005, 3:43 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Young_Labour">Young Labour</a></strong></p>
<p>Young Labour Welcomes No Interest On Loans</p>
<p>Young Labour welcomed today&#39;s announcement by Labour Leader Helen Clark on major improvements to student support policy in the tertiary sector.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a major step forward for all students and graduates. Never again will people have to worry about interest making their loans grow out of control.</p>
<p>&quot;The policy is going to put a huge dent in repayment times for graduates and will encourage them keep their skills in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;The debt burden needed to be tackled and this government has proven it is committed to ensuring the country has the skills it needs to build our future</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has shown that it is committed to investing in New Zealand&#39;s future, rather than giving our future away with tax cuts. Young Labour is looking forward to taking that message out to the youth of New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders should remember the dark days of the 1990&#39;s where the National government allowed fees to spiral out of control at an average rate of 15% per year coupled with interest accruing while they studied. The result was thousands of students living on the breadline and a generation in debt.</p>
<p>&quot;Students and their parents now face a choice.</p>
<p>&quot;They can vote for Labour, who are committed to keeping tertiary education affordable and investing in our future.</p>
<p>&quot;Or, they can vote for a National Party that has promised to allow fees to rise, and to introduce a cap on tertiary funding.</p>
<p>&quot;By removing interest paid on student loans, Labour has shown what can be done by investing in the future rather than giving the future away in tax cuts.&quot; Mr Roberts concluded.</p>
