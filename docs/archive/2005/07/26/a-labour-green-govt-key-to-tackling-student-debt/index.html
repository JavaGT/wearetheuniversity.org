<p>A Labour-Green Govt the key to tackling student debt crisis</p>
<p>The Green Party is applauding Labour&#39;s tertiary education policy and reminding Kiwis that only a Labour-Green Government will deliver real relief for students and graduates.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re heartened that Labour has listened to our concerns to offer relief for graduates crippled with debt and to students struggling to make ends meet,&quot; Green Tertiary Education Spokesperson Nandor Tanczos says.</p>
<p>&quot;Early last month, the Greens put student debt on the election agenda with the launch of our student debt write-off scheme. It&#39;s great to see Labour now acknowledging that student debt is an important election for this campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;Scrapping interest on student loans is a welcome first step. Many graduates are frustrated that, despite making loan repayments, their debt isn&#39;t getting any smaller. It&#39;s completely abhorrent that graduates have been charged interest on the money they borrowed in order to study, and it&#39;s a credit to this Government that it has finally remedied this injustice.</p>
<p>&quot;However, scrapping interest won&#39;t, on its own, prevent some graduates from facing a lifetime of debt. Many graduates in low-paying jobs are faced with decades of debt repayments and are significantly disadvantaged as a result. Some mechanism, such as the Greens&#39; debt write-off scheme, needs to be found to ensure that no graduates are still in debt decades after they finish studying.&quot;</p>
<p>Nandor says tertiary education would be a key battleground in the 2005 election.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ll be telling graduates up and down the country that, for real relief in paying off your debt, you need to elect a Labour-Green Government. It&#39;s essential to the prospect of real progress on the student debt issue that the Greens, and not NZ First, are negotiating the legislative priorities of a Labour-led Government.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s also important to point out the stark difference for students and graduates between a Labour-Green Government and a National-NZ First Government. While we&#39;ll put the interests of students and graduates front and centre, the Nats want a return to the 1990s when food banks flourished on our campuses and the concerns of our young people were completely ignored.&quot;</p>
<p>Nandor says Labour&#39;s commitment to ensuring that half of all students receive student allowances is also a welcome, bold move.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greens believe no Kiwis should have to borrow in order to make ends meet while studying. That&#39;s why we&#39;ve proposed a Universal Student Allowance, phased in over several stages. Labour&#39;s policy shows that it shares our concern about a lack of access to allowances being a key driver of student debt. While we&#39;d like Labour to go further, this allowance-expanding policy is a very encouraging first step.&quot;</p>
