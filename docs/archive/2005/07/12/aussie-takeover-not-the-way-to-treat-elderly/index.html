<p>Aussie Takeover Not The Way To Treat Elderly</p>
<p>“New Zealand First has grave concerns for the future of non-profit aged care providers in New Zealand who are being squeezed out the market because of rapidly rising costs, making way for business-focused groups to move profitably into the sector”, says New Zealand First Leader, Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Wealthy Australian investor’s have already cottoned on to this gap in our market”, says Mr Peters in response to Australian healthcare company DCA Group’s plans to buy New Zealand’s largest private resthome and hospital owner, Guardian Healthcare, for $300 million.</p>
<p>“This is not good news for the thousands who only have their pensions to live on and require affordable rest home care.</p>
<p>“We maintain that our treatment of our seniors sends a clear signal of our status as a developed nation. We believe that there is little point in pursuing economic growth and other objectives if our seniors are not looked after adequately.</p>
<p>“We believe that we must refocus both attitudes and actions of the government and government agencies toward our seniors, ensuring that their valued status is clearly evident instead of leaving it up to the Aussies”, said Mr Peters.</p>
