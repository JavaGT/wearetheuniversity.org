<p><strong>Monday, 4 July 2005, 10:54 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour must act on ‘Maori police’</p>
<p>National Party Maori Affairs spokesman Gerry Brownlee says the extortion racket in Gisborne being run by a Maori sovereignty group should surprise no one.</p>
<p>“The police must immediately commit resources to shut them down and those involved must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders will not tolerate this kind of racist extortion, based on a totally perverted view of the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
<p>“In election year, Labour cannot afford to look weak on this issue. It must act.</p>
<p>“But sadly, no-one should be surprised that these sorts of stand-over tactics have come to light under this Government.</p>
<p>“During the Foreshore and Seabed select committee hearings a number of Maori expressed a view that they did not believe they were part of the Crown in this country.</p>
<p>“That kind of thinking has been helped along by taxpayer-funded Treaty propaganda campaigns worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>“In 2003, National even found taxpayer-funded pamphlets that meant one thing in Maori and another in English.</p>
<p>“Under Labour, this thuggery in Gisborne is a taste of things to come,” says Mr Brownlee.</p>
