<p><strong>Monday, 4 July 2005, 2:41 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Bill English National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>04 July 2005</p>
<p>Parents right to be angry over school reviews</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English says the people of Invercargill and Timaru have every right to be angry about a new report on school reviews.</p>
<p>The report published by the New Zealand School Trustees Association shows large-scale school mergers could affect children&#39;s education for up to four years.</p>
<p>&quot;Both cities had their schools turned upside down by large-scale savage school closures. Parents were always suspicious that the changes would badly affect their children&#39;s education. The report proves they were right,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;The official line is that everything is hunky dory, and that was repeated by Ministry of Education officials today.</p>
<p>&quot;But this report lifts the lid on what is really going on.</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard and the Labour Party should answer to parents for this, not hide behind civil servants who care even less about families in Invercargill and Timaru than Labour does.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s school reviews reward good schools by closing them down and disrupting large numbers of students.</p>
<p>&quot;National wants standards, choice and excellence in education, and Labour-style school reviews get in the way of those things,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
