<p>Rheumatoid arthritis gene link proven</p>
<p>The gene PTPN22 has been confirmed as one of the factors that cause rheumatoid arthritis by University of Otago researchers.</p>
<p>“This is only the second gene in the past 25 years to be universally accepted as a gene associated with the susceptibility for arthritis,” Department of Biochemistry Senior Research Fellow Dr Tony Merriman says.</p>
<p>The finding has just been published in the leading international arthritis research journal Arthritis and Rheumatism.</p>
<p>The research was funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand and Arthritis New Zealand.</p>
<p>The gene was first identified last year as potentially being instrumental in causing rheumatoid arthritis, and Dr Merriman’s study is one of the first studies to replicate - and thus validate - the original findings.</p>
<p>“The initial finding is only half the story. It’s only when that finding has been replicated convincingly that the initial paper becomes of more importance, and I am delighted that we have been able to do that,” Dr Merriman says.</p>
<p>“This is the culmination of six years of collecting samples and I want to thank the many hundreds of people with and without rheumatoid arthritis from around New Zealand who generously gave DNA samples. The New Zealand Rheumatology Research Network also played a critical role.”</p>
<p>The resultant DNA database will play an important role in replicating other international findings and generating new findings, as a large sample group is vital to ensure results are reliable.</p>

<p>Confirmation that the gene plays a definite role in rheumatoid arthritis means research pharmacists can study the gene’s mechanism and where its messages break down in order to develop drugs to correct the defect.</p>
<p>“Previously we knew rheumatoid arthritis was an immune disease but the immune system is so huge and complex it is difficult for researchers to know where to look – or necessarily what was a cause and what was a result of the disease. Now we have a real starting point for research into treatment as we know that PTPN22 is a cause.”</p>
<p>PTPN22 plays an important role in limiting the activity of the immune system’s soldier cells, T lymphocytes, which attack and destroy foreign cells. In rheumatoid arthritis T lymphocytes get out of control and initiate and drive the attack on the body’s own cells.</p>
<p>“So it would seem that the message to control the T lymphocytes and stop attacking the joints becomes faulty,” Dr Merriman says.</p>
<p>- Rheumatoid arthritis is a debilitating autoimmune disease where the body attacks itself in the joints, causing inflammation, stiffness and pain. It affects one in 50 New Zealand adults.</p>
<p>- PTPN22, is also over-represented in people with Type 1 diabetes and thyroiditis, providing extra evidence it is a causal factor in autoimmune diseases generally.</p>
