<p>International watch on oil price research</p>
<p>An article in Britain’s Economist magazine focusing on work by a Massey University researcher is the latest in a run of good news for the finance department.</p>
<p>And the word from Professor Ben Jacobsen is watch this space.</p>
<p>Professor Jacobsen, from Erasmus university in Rotterdam is one of several top academics to have recently joined Massey’s finance researchers.</p>
<p>His analysis of the links between international oil price movements and stock market returns caught the eye of the influential magazine, which noted his theory of a link between oil price rises and share price falls was, if correct, a genuine market inefficiency.</p>
<p>The research by Professor Jacobsen and two colleagues at Erasmus was first published in October 2003 but updated in February this year.</p>
<p>Massey’s finance and commerce department heads Professors Chris Moore and Lawrence Rose are confident the arrival of the researchers of Professor Jacobsen’s calibre will raise the ranking of the finance programme for research productivity, which earlier this year shot up to 12th of 170 Asia-Pacific region universities.</p>
<p>Professor Jacobsen says he expects the research he is currently working on with his Massey colleagues will be “big news” when published.</p>
