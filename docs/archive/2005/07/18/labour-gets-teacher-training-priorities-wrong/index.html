<p><strong>Monday, 18 July 2005, 9:28 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour gets teacher training priorities wrong</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English says Labour is training far too many primary school teachers, many of whom have no prospect of getting a job in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education figures show that 56% of primary teaching graduates from 2000 had found work by 2004. Of those graduating in 2002 50% are yet to find work.</p>
<p>“Labour is spending millions training more primary teachers despite a surplus. This money would be much better spent plugging the gaps in secondary teaching where there is a considerable shortage,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“New graduates tell me that outside of Auckland only about a third of new graduates can find work.</p>
<p>“This is just another example of Labour’s failings in tertiary education. It wastes $50 million annually on a bureaucracy to oversee the sector which can’t even make obvious and necessary decisions like directing more resource away from primary teaching and into secondary teaching.”</p>
