<p><strong>Monday, 18 July 2005, 4:55 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Students warn: access must not be compromised</p>
<p>Students believe that their tertiary education should be of a high quality and are therefore generally supportive of the tertiary education changes announced by the Government today.</p>
<p>&quot;All New Zealanders are entitled to a high quality tertiary education and students are supportive of moves to improve quality. Public and student money should not be spent on low quality provision,&quot; said Camilla Belich, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>&quot;However, we would be concerned if the funding shifts initiated by the Government compromised access to quality courses. We ask the Government to ensure that all New Zealanders are able to access a high quality tertiary education,&quot; Belich said.</p>
<p>Trevor Mallard announced a number of tertiary education changes today focused on sub-degree provision funding shifts and governance of the tertiary sector agencies.</p>
<p>&quot;Students enrolled in courses or institutions where funding is cut or shifted should not be disadvantaged by these changes,&quot; said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of NZUSA.</p>
<p>&quot;We will also be asking that the Secretary of Education ensure that there is a high level of student involvement in the new governance arrangements for tertiary education,&quot; Kirton said.</p>
