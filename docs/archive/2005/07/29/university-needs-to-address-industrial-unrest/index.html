<p>Lincoln University needs to address Industrial Unrest</p>
<p>Lincoln University Students Association President, Andrew Gage said today that Lincoln University needed to be more active in terms of its approach to resolve the present industrial unrest between itself and AUS in bargaining for a national collective.</p>
<p>Mr Gage said that a significant number of students had approached him in relation to the present industrial action and while they were sympathetic to the concerns of University staff, felt that they were the “meat in the sandwich.”</p>
<p>“Students are telling me that the strike is dramatically affecting their study. A significant number of them, particularly International Students are demanding that their money is refunded for loss of lecture time.” Mr Gage said.</p>
<p>Mr Gage stated that the Association supported the concept of a National Agreement covering all the Universities as a means of ensuring that high quality staff, learning services and conditions was maintained nationally.</p>
<p>Mr Gage also emphasised the importance of the NZ Vice-Chancellor’s Committees cooperation and solidarity with AUS in addressing the University staff wage dispute.</p>
<p>“It is in Lincoln’s best interest to endorse such an option,” Mr Gage commented.</p>
<p>“In the end, it is the students that are suffering here. Thanks to both National and Labour Governments, students, particularly International Students, pay large fees. The students need to be receiving the comprehensive education that they’re paying for”Mr Gage said.</p>
<p>Mr Gage stated that the Association is currently investigating legal options against the University in relation to students who are losing out on the service provisions that they have been promised.</p>
