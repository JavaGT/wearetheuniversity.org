<p>Unitec wins unique case against Government</p>
<p>Unitec has won their court case against the Government today after a long battle to prove that the suspension by the Government of Unitec’s application for University Status was unlawful.</p>
<p>“This decision proves that the Labour government has its own agenda when deciding whether or not Unitec should become a university. There is no other reason why the government would have delayed the decision-making process unless it wanted to influence the outcome,” says Robert Freeth, President, Unitec Student Union</p>
<p>The outcome proved that the Associate Minister Steve Maharey unlawfully suspended Unitec’s university application, breached the laws of natural justice and breached the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.</p>
<p>“The only expectation now is that the settlement amount is adequate and reflects the seriousness of the Government’s reckless actions,” says Freeth.</p>
<p>“Compensation from the Government is valuable money that will make up for the funding wasted on battling for fair and due process,” says Freeth.</p>
<p>“Students will see this epic win as a well earned victory” Say Freeth. “They will see this as the first victory for Unitec in gaining its rightful status as a University” Says Freeth.</p>
