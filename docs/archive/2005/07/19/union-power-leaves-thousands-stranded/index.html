<p>Wayne Mapp MP National Party Industrial Relations Spokesman</p>

<p>Union power leaves thousands stranded</p>
<p>National&#39;s Industrial Relations spokesman, Wayne Mapp, says thousands of travellers are this week paying the price for Labour giving unwarranted power to unions.</p>
<p>Industrial action has resulted in the cancellation of many international Air New Zealand flights, including those to Melbourne, Sydney, Singapore and Osaka.</p>
<p>&quot;Around 15,000 travellers have already had their plans disrupted because of a 0.5% difference in what the union has asked for, and what Air New Zealand has offered,&quot; says Dr Mapp.</p>
<p>&quot;The huge wave of industrial action we&#39;ve seen this year is exactly what National warned would happen as a result of Labour&#39;s employment legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;If the unions were serious about boosting wage rates they would have lobbied their mates in the Labour Party to bring down taxes and boost productivity in the work place.</p>
<p>&quot;The cancellation of these flights, coupled with the impact of the Holidays Act, which saw a third of bars and eateries close over the Christmas - New Year period, will leave potential visitors asking themselves if they should be heading elsewhere,&quot; says Dr Mapp.</p>
