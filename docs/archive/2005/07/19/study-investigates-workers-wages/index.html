<p>Study investigates workers’ wages</p>
<p>New Zealanders’ pay packets have risen over the last year but those on the lowest wages are still lagging behind, according to a new report produced by Victoria University’s Industrial Relations Centre.</p>
<p>Employment Agreements: Bargaining Trends &amp; Employment Law Update 2004/2005 found that New Zealand workers’ pay rose by an average 2.8% in the year to June 2005. This is the largest pay increase for workers on collective agreements for the last 14 years, with a yearly average of just 2.2%.</p>
<p>Professor of Human Resource Management &amp; Industrial Relations, George Lafferty, says the period 2000-2005 has seen more rapid wages growth than during the previous five years.</p>
<p>“However, increases are modest considering historically low unemployment, high economic growth and greater demand for skilled labour. And, not all New Zealand workers are enjoying better pay.”</p>
<p>For workers on the lowest wages contained in collective agreements, there was an average increase of just $12 (2.5 per cent) for the year to June 2005 – and of just more than $10 per year for the last 14 years.</p>
<p>Professor Lafferty says there are industries where the lowest wage has increased by less than $1 each year for the last 14 years. And more than 300 collective agreements contain wage rates that do not meet the new legal minimum of $9.50 per hour.</p>
<p>And there was reason to be concerned about New Zealanders’ savings for retirement.</p>
<p>“There is a low rate of superannuation arrangements with 57 per cent of workers covered by collective employment agreements having no superannuation provision,” he said.</p>
<p>Only 12 per cent of the private sector employers made contributions to workers’ super schemes, and these payments ranged from $1.20 to $89 per week.</p>
<p>The Industrial Relations Centre will be presenting analysis from its most recent survey of collective employment agreements, at seminars in Dunedin, Christchurch, Hamilton and Auckland over the next two weeks.
