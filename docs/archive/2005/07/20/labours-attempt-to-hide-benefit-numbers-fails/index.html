<p>Labour&#39;s attempt to hide benefit numbers fails</p>
<p>Dr Muriel Newman<br>Wednesday, 20 July 2005<br>Press Releases - Social Welfare</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s latest claims of success in reducing benefit dependency are now being greeted with public scepticism, ACT Welfare Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s track record of manipulating statistics to make themselves look good has resulted in a widespread loss of credibility in the eyes of the general public. People now think that Labour&#39;s claims are either inflated or worse that they have been manipulated.</p>
<p>&quot;This certainly appears to be the case when it comes to welfare numbers; how can Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey reconcile claiming the credit for low unemployment numbers when there are still 74,000 people dependent on the dole at a time when there is a critical shortage of workers,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Further, given the 38 percent rise in sickness benefit and invalid benefit numbers to a record 138,000 working age adults, how many of those previously registered as unemployed are now hidden within these two benefits?</p>
<p>&quot;How many of these unemployed are now calling themselves students and are getting a student allowance to do dodgy courses?</p>
<p>&quot;How many of them are employed in job creation schemes within the bloated Government service?</p>
<p>&quot;What we do know is that Treasury has clearly stated that the number of beneficiaries is going to rise by 19,000 in the next three years.</p>
<p>&quot;It is this culture of manipulation and deceit to make themselves look good that will eventually lead to Labour&#39;s downfall,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
