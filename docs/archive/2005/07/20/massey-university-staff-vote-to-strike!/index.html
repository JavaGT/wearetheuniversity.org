<p>Massey University staff vote to strike!</p>
<p>“Union members at Massey University at Wellington campus and Palmerston North campuses voted to strike today after considering a last-minute offer from the Vice Chancellor Judith Kinnear that was described as “too little, too late”.</p>
<p>Members at stop-work meetings this morning voted unanimously to proceed with the planned strike action. They are currently picketing in Wellington (at the Wallace Street entrance to the campus) and Palmerston North. Massey at Wellington members will be joining their colleagues at Victoria University in a rally later this morning.</p>
<p>Sharn Riggs, National Secretary for the Association of Staff in Tertiary Education said that the Wellington campus was “deserted” with students opting to remain at home during the industrial action.</p>
