<p>Govt must ensure extra Uni funding reaches staff: Greens</p>
<p>The Government must address the issue of university salaries or the quality of New Zealand academia will be seriously compromised, Green MP Nandor Tanczos says.</p>
<p>Nandor, the Greens&#39; Tertiary Education Spokesperson, is making the call after speaking today to striking staff at Waikato University. The Hamilton rally, which followed a picket and march, was part of nationwide strike action by members of the Association of University Staff (AUS).</p>
<p>&quot;University salaries are a significant issue for all staff, not just academics. It is time that the universities realised that it is people that make a great university, not grandiose buildings or flash marketing,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;The Green Party supports the call by the AUS for a Multi-Employer Collective Agreement, or MECA, and believe that the Government has a role in facilitating it.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been more money going into tertiary education generally and universities in particular under this Government. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t seem to have found its way to the staff.&quot;</p>
