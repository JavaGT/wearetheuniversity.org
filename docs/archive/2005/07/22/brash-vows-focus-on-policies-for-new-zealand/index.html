<p>Don Brash MP<br>National Party Leader</p>

<p>Brash Vows Focus on Policies for New Zealand</p>
<p>National Party Leader Don Brash is promising to continue his focus on the issues affecting New Zealanders, and not be diverted by ongoing attacks from Labour Party Cabinet Ministers.</p>
<p>Dr Brash describes this week&#39;s personal attacks from Labour as &quot;the most sustained, misguided and dishonest assault on a senior political figure for many years.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My response to Labour&#39;s baseless spin will be to release more policy on the issues affecting the lives of mainstream New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;This Sunday, Bill English will release our core Tertiary Education policy. On Monday, Nick Smith and I will release details of our Resource Management policy. Next Wednesday, we will outline our policy for Local Government.</p>
<p>&quot;These come hard on the heels of the Early Childcare policy I released two weeks ago, our Veterans policy released last week, and yesterday&#39;s Student Loans policy announcement.</p>
<p>&quot;I invite New Zealanders to decide which Party is focussed on issues that will give them, and their families, a better future, and which parties are looking to conduct a shameful brawl in the gutter.</p>
<p>&quot;I entered politics because I believe New Zealand needs to do better if we seriously expect our children, and our grandchildren, to build their futures here.</p>
<p>&quot;The Clark Government can conduct this election in the gutter if that is all they have to offer New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;I intend to outline, debate and vigorously promote policies that will deliver a better future for our country.</p>
<p>&quot;And none of the desperate antics and misinformation I have seen from the Labour Party this week is going to steer me off that course,&quot; says Dr Brash.</p>
