<p>Collins Comments</p>
<p>Judith Collins Clevedon MP<br>22 July 2005</p>
<p>Victory for the parents of Kawakawa Bay - National welcomes another Labour U Turn.</p>
<p>Well done to families in Kawakawa Bay for being staunch and standing up for their kids over Labour’s proposed changes to school bus routes. The changes would have meant no school was able to use its own buses to pick up students who live closer to another school, or who live within 3.2 kilometres of their own school. This would have left kids from Kawakawa Bay with no way of getting to Clevedon School other than parents driving them.</p>
<p>The Government has this week pulled back from making any immediate changes to the policy. This means that for now at least, school buses should be able to run as normal as long as the school has sufficient funding.</p>
<p>I welcome this U-turn, as the proposed changes were extremely unpopular amongst schools and parents alike, who said there had been an appalling lack of consultation over the issue. These changes were driven by Labour Party ideology, rather than what was best for schools, pupils and parents. I hope that the Ministry of Education now makes sure Clevedon School gets the funding it needs.</p>
<p>National has said all along we will leave the current policy in place with no change. It gives parents choice about what school their child goes to, and gives schools the power to plan their own bus runs.</p>
<p>Transpower announces final route decision</p>
<p>Transpower has confirmed that the interim route announced in May is the final overhead route for the proposed transmission line between Otahuhu and Whakamaru. The route generally follows the existing western route option south from a point near Ormiston Road, and includes the western route option south of Hunua. The route then follows the existing Arapuni-Pakuranga 110kV line through to Arapuni. South of Arapuni, the western route links through to the eastern route option. The route ends at a planned substation in Whakamaru.</p>

<p>This is not a final decision – the Electricity Commission has until July 2006 to make its final decision on whether the transmission line should proceed.</p>
<p>Transpower, a state-owned entity, has failed to listen to its owners – taxpayers.</p>
