<p><strong>Friday, 22 July 2005, 5:18 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National Candidates Son Has More Sense Than Partisan Father</p>
<p>New Zealand First leader Rt Hon Winston Peters says the New Zealand Students Association co-president Andrew Kirton has far more political sense than his Father, Weston Kirton the National Party candidate for Taupo.</p>
<p>The NZUSA co-president criticised his Father’s party yesterday referring to National’s unconvincing past tenures in Government, which generated significant decreases in student allowance eligibility.</p>
<p>Kirton Junior also disapproved of the National Party’s new rebates for interest repayment on loans.</p>
<p>“It seems to me that the offspring of National Party candidates have more political nous when it comes to policy than their parents,” said Mr Peters.</p>
<p>“It makes you wonder what gets discussed around the Kirton family dinner table, and I don’t think it would be pass the salt.</p>
<p>“The National candidates obviously have no ability to think for themselves, following idly in the footsteps of their leader Don Brash.</p>
<p>“Perhaps the National party should heed the advice of their relatives, who seem to have more idea about policy and politics than their partisan elders,” concluded Mr Peters.</p>
