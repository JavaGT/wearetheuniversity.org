<p>Students Association fails students again</p>
<p>&quot;NZUSA has again shown a complete disregard for the actual opinions of the students it claims to represent&quot; says New Zealand Young Nationals President, Jamie Simpson.</p>
<p>Only ninety minutes after the release of National&#39;s student loan policy, the New Zealand Students Association had blindly criticised the policy, claiming students do not see it as being effective.</p>
<p>&quot;The comments by the union are typical of an organisation where student&#39;s views play a secondary role to the personal political opinions of the officeholders.&quot;</p>
<p>Not only are students forced to be members of the organisation, but views not necessarily their own are published in their name without consultation.</p>
<p>&quot;Our organisation welcomes relief for those struggling with large student loans after graduation. Here is a policy based on sound principles which addresses the 460,000 people in New Zealand who currently have, or who will graduate with student loans&quot;, says Mr Simpson.</p>
<p>&quot;NZUSA has its head in the clouds - it continues to pursue unrealistic goals and its members will continue to be disappointed&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s policy is one I whole-heartedly support, and shows Don Brash and the National&#39;s Party&#39;s commitment to easing the tax burden on some of our best and brightest - giving them greater incentives to stay in New Zealand&quot; says Jamie Simpson.</p>
