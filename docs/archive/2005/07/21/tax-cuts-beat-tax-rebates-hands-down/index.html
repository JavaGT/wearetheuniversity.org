<p>Tax Cuts Beat Tax Rebates Hands Down</p>
<p>Rodney Hide<br>Thursday, 21 July 2005<br>Press Releases - Taxation</p>
<p>Comprehensive tax cuts are the best way to help students repay their loans faster, ACT Leader Rodney Hide said today.</p>
<p>&quot;What graduates need are higher wages and more money in their pocket - that&#39;s what every New Zealander needs.</p>
<p>&quot;Tax cuts the size ACT has proposed are the best way to help graduating students hammer their debt down in double quick time - not National&#39;s rebate scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;National explains their rebate scheme would benefit a graduate earning $45,000 a year by $693 a year. That&#39;s if they had a loan of $30,000. In fact they would only receive that benefit in their first year. Their interest charge falls as they pay down their loan and so too does National&#39;s rebate.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT&#39;s tax policy would see that graduate $2,270 better-off whether or not they had a loan. They would be that much better off every year.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s rebate scheme would allow them to pay off their 1.25 times faster. ACT&#39;s tax cuts would allow them to pay off their loan 2.5 times faster.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT&#39;s tax cuts are better for students - and better for every New Zealander than targeted tax rebates. Tax cuts will also spur growth - something tax rebates won&#39;t do.</p>
<p>&quot;The benefit from National&#39;s rebate scheme also becomes smaller each year because as graduates pay off their loans the interest charge and their corresponding rebate decreases.</p>
<p>&quot;The best thing National could do for students - and all working New Zealanders - is to reverse their support for Cullen&#39;s Super Fund and give every Kiwi a decent tax cut,&quot; Mr Hide said.</p>
