<p>Nats loan rebates will not solve student debt crisis</p>
<p>Students are warning that the National Party&#39;s new rebates for interest repayments on loans will not keep graduates in New Zealand or effectively target the $7 billion dollar student debt monster.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason total student debt is well over $7 billion is because of lack of access to allowances and high fees. This policy will not be successful if, at the same time, student fees continue to grow,&quot; said Camilla Belich, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>&quot;This policy also does little to help those who would really benefit from a debt write off. Mums and Dads at home taking time out of the workforce will not benefit from this policy, neither would those on low incomes. It is a policy essentially of tax rebates for the rich,&quot; Belich said.</p>
<p>Don Brash announced a policy this afternoon targeted at keeping graduates in New Zealand. The rebate works by giving borrowers making repayments a rebate on part of their interest that would then be paid directly onto the principle of their loan.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important to see this rebate scheme for graduates in context. When National was last in power student allowance eligibility went down from 85% in 1990 to 36% in 1999 and student fees for university students more than doubled over the same period,&quot; said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of NZUSA.</p>
<p>&quot;National refuses to commit to increasing eligibility to student allowances and have not ruled out fee increases. Students and graduates will be seeking a greater commitment to student support before unpacking their bags,&quot; Kirton said.</p>
