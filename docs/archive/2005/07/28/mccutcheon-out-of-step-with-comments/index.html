<p>McCutcheon Out Of Step With Comments</p>
<p>Earlier today the Auckland University vice-chancellor Stuart McCutcheon publicly stated his opposition to the Labour party’s policy over student interest write-offs. The University of Canterbury Students’ Association President, George Hampton has spoken against Mr McCutcheon’s comments:</p>
<p>“McCutcheon is way out of step with reality. Any potential funding does not come from a vote allocated to tertiary education alone but from a fund dedicated to Labour’s 3rd term in Government. Labour might as well have spent this money on health and hip replacements as it did on education. This policy will hopefully be of great benefit to all students. The Vice-Chancellor should value what this change in policy will potentially do for his students instead of focusing on what never would have been.”</p>
