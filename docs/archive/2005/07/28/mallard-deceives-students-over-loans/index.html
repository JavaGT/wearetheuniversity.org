<p>Mallard deceives students over loans</p>
<p>National’s Education spokesman, Bill English, says Labour has deceived many of the 200,000 students who have visited the online loans calculator to calculate their savings under Labour’s interest-free proposal.</p>
<p>Mr English says Labour’s savings estimates for individual loan borrowers are approximately 30% higher than calculations provided by the Inland Revenue Department.</p>
<p>For example, Labour’s calculator estimates that someone with a $15,000 loan and an annual income of $35,000 would save $10,139 in interest. But IRD says only $6,820.74 in interest would be accumulated – a difference of $3,318.26.</p>
<p>“Some students will find that the Labour calculator has overestimated their savings by as much as 50%,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“As students discover the truth about Labour’s policy, and taxpayers discover they are paying for a 21st century version of Social Credit, Mr Mallard’s scheme will come under serious scrutiny.</p>
<p>“Under normal circumstances, a Minister would run such a significant proposal past the IRD and Treasury, but they knew those organisations would put the kibosh on the policy if they knew about it.</p>
<p>“This kind of sloppiness and misrepresentation puts the integrity of Labour’s entire policy in doubt,” says Mr English.</p>
