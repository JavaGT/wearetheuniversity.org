<p>Hon Bill English National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s talk on trade training is &#39;rank hypocrisy&#39;</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English says Labour&#39;s talk on trade training is rank hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Labour today announced that it would fund an additional 5,000 apprenticeships.</p>
<p>&quot;On Monday, Labour turned their back on workers when they bet the house on interest free student loans,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Under Labour, every young person would see university study as a much more attractive option than trade training. Why would anyone borrow from a bank, at market rates, money for tools and equipment when the government will lend you money for nothing to go university?</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s priorities are clear: they would spend $30 million on trade training and more than ten times that on university students. &quot;Just when young people were turning to the trades because of better incomes and job security, Labour is pushing them back to academia.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s bums-on-seats industry training policy will also lead to all the same problems it has had with radio sing-along and phantom computer courses.</p>
<p>&quot;A policy driven by numbers for the sake of it will lead to rorts and drive down quality. Industry training organisations will have every incentive to put any warm body into a workplace so they can collect the government&#39;s cash.</p>
<p>&quot;There are already worrying signs that the growth in apprenticeship numbers is leaving apprentices with a raw deal.</p>
<p>&quot;I hear far too many stories about lack of supervision, lack of real training on the job and too many apprentices dropping out.</p>
<p>&quot;What the economy needs is people with real skill, not some half-baked, unfinished apprenticeship.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s targets are unrealistic because businesses hammered by its anti-business policies and a slowing economy can&#39;t afford to take on the numbers. Labour missed the opportunity of a growing economy over the past five years because it spent all its money on dodgy low quality courses and restricted numbers in trade training.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s student loans and trade training packages have allowed its true colours to shine through - they have deserted the workers in favour of academics,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
