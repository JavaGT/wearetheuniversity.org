<p>World recognised financial risk exam coming to NZ</p>
<p>Students and professional financial risk managers can now take the Financial Risk Manager (FRM) certification exam in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The world recognised FRM exam will be held at AUT on Saturday, 19 November 2005. Previously, it could only be taken overseas.</p>
<p>The exam will follow close on the heels of the inaugural meeting of the New Zealand chapter of Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP), scheduled for October.</p>
<p>GARP is the world’s leading organisation for risk managers. The New Zealand chapter is headed by two AUT Business Faculty academics, recently appointed co-regional directors.</p>
<p>Professor Alireza Tourani-Rad and Associate Professor Ming-Hua Liu were appointed to represent New Zealand by the 46,000-member association.</p>
<p>Alongside the New Zealand chapter of GARP for professionals, they are establishing a college chapter for university students, based at AUT.</p>
<p>“We hope to promote best practices and provide a forum where risk managers and researchers from the financial industry, corporate sector, government and academic institutions can interact with each other,” Alireza and Ming-Hua said.</p>
<p>“We also hope to provide networking opportunities for students, to cultivate their interest in the risk field, provide research opportunities and a test location for all those seeking FRM certification.”</p>
<p>GARP is a non-profit independent association of risk management practitioners and researchers representing banks, investment management firms, government regulatory bodies, academic institutions, corporations and other financial organisations.</p>
