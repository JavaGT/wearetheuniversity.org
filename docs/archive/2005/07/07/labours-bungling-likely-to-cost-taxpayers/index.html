<p>Labour&#39;s bungling likely to cost taxpayers</p>
<p>The Labour Government’s “we know best” attitude has brought it on the wrong side of a High Court decision today, says ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington.</p>
<p>“The High Court’s ruling that Steve Maharey behaved illegally in suspending Unitech’s application for university status and breached natural justice by delaying the approval process is a victory for the polytech, but leaves the taxpayer paying for the mess.</p>
<p>“It’s appalling that Unitec had to go to this extent to fight Maharey, who acted as if he was above the law. It should be noted that this was while Labour was turning a blind eye to Te Wananga o Aotearoa promoting itself a university.</p>
<p>“If Maharey had to put his own money on the line he might not have been so cavalier in his treatment of Unitec.</p>
<p>“It now appears that taxpayers will have to fork out for his arrogance and bulling.</p>
<p>“I congratulate Unitec for its victory. This decision will go along way to improving its status and enable it to recruit good staff and improve the quality of students that graduate,” Miss Coddington said.</p>
