<p><strong>Thursday, 7 July 2005, 1:01 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Public hearing to be held on Govt’s student allowance cuts</p>
<p>Students are pleased that Parliament’s Regulations Review Committee has resolved to hold a public hearing about the brutal cuts to the independent circumstances and married students’ allowances this year.</p>
<p>“Over 7000 students were left without the Government support they were previously entitled to when allowances were cut at the beginning of this year,” said Camilla Belich, Co-president of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>“The ironic reality of the cuts meant a loss of independence for students. Many have been forced to move home, take on extra jobs and borrow from the student loan scheme in order to survive,” Belich said.</p>
<p>NZUSA filed a complaint with the committee on 13 June and received notice last week that the committee had decided to go ahead with a public hearing.</p>
<p>“NZUSA along with affected students from around New Zealand will want to use the public hearing to tell Parliament how this injustice has negatively affected their lives,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-president of NZUSA.</p>
<p>The Greens, NZ First, The Maori Party, United Future and the Labour Party all signed a pledge promising to increase eligibility to allowances if they formed part of the next Government at the NZUSA Annual Conference last week.</p>
