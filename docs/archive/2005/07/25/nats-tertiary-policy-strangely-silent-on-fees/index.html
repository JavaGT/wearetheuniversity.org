<p>Nats tertiary policy strangely silent on student fees</p>
<p>NZUSA is fearful that the release of the National Party’s Tertiary Education Policy today could spell the return of the high student fee rises of the 90s.</p>
<p>“When the National Party were last in power, fees rose by 12% on average per year meaning students were forced to fork out hundreds on dollars more for their course fees year after year,” said Andrew Kirton Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>“We challenge Don Brash to come clean on his intentions for student fees. National must let students and their families know before the election if a National led Government would mean a more expensive tertiary education,” Kirton said.</p>
<p>“Students will be supportive of the National Party’s policy commitment to a quality tertiary education. However, increasing quality for tertiary courses will be rendered meaningless for thousands of students if high course fees mean courses are unaffordable and therefore unattainable for students,” said Camilla Belich, Co-President of NZUSA.</p>
<p>“We are also concerned that National’s ‘tight spending caps for enrolments’ will mean that tertiary education may not be accessible to all New Zealanders, “said Belich.</p>
