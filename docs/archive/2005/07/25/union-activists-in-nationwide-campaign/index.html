<p><strong>Monday, 25 July 2005, 5:17 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions">New Zealand Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p>Union Activists in Nationwide Campaign</p>
<p>Trade unionists from around the country are marking the announcement of the election date by handing out leaflets reminding voters that there&#39;s a lot at stake in this general election.</p>
<p>Unionists will be on the streets in several centres tomorrow handing out thousands of the Council of Trade Unions&#39; leaflet &quot;Will Your Vote Work for Working People?&quot;</p>
<p>The leaflet urges voters to get on the roll and to consider how each party&#39;s employment policy would affect their jobs, pay and employment opportunities.</p>
<p>&quot;The CTU doesn&#39;t tell working people how to vote but the leaflet outlines the differences in the main parties, and the smaller parties that support them,&quot; said CTU president Ross Wilson.</p>
<p>&quot;National has declared war on workers with its employment policy that would allow new employees to be sacked after 90 days for no reason and with no right of appeal.</p>
<p>&quot;That party wants to bring back the Employment Contracts Act which, for thousands of workers during the 1990s, meant pay cuts and losing conditions such as overtime and penal rates.&quot;</p>
<p>Workers had won significant gains under the policies of Labour-led governments since 1999, Ross Wilson said. &quot;Employment policies hit workers in the pocket and unions are urging voters to think carefully before they vote.&quot;</p>
