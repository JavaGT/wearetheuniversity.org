<p>National&#39;s tax cuts with strings attached</p>
<p>Rodney Hide<br>Wednesday, 6 July 2005<br>Press Releases - Taxation</p>
<p>ACT Leader Rodney Hide today said that National’s childcare tax rebate policy was a backward step for New Zealand.</p>
<p>“What New Zealand needs is comprehensive tax cuts without strings attached, so hardworking Kiwis can make up their own minds how they spend their money without having National or Labour telling them how to do it,” Mr Hide said.</p>
<p>“National’s policy is a total abandonment by the party of any principle of sound tax design and the philosophy that hardworking Kiwis should keep more of the money they earn with no strings attached.</p>
<p>“The trouble with National’s policy is that it complicates New Zealand’s tax system. It only lets you keep more of your money if you send your children to daycare, and it discriminates against mothers who stay at home and look after their children.</p>
<p>“The best policy for parents is ACT’s tax policy of dropping the top tax rate to 25c in the dollar and extending the 15c rate up to $38,000. That will allow parents to afford childcare if that is their choice, or to spend their money looking after their children as best they see fit.</p>
<p>“Previous governments have worked hard to simplify and flatten taxes by eliminating tax rebates. Now National wants to return to them. What’s next? Tax rebates for paying off student loans or saving for retirement.</p>
<p>“Don Brash knows that the best tax policy is flatter taxes with no tax rebates, so Kiwis get to keep more of their own money and get to choose how to spend it as best they see fit. He&#39;s having to compromise his policy principles before he’s even got into office.</p>
<p>“Even Michael Cullen realises that tax rebates are a dopey idea. It’s clear that National, even with Don Brash, needs ACT to keep its policies on track,” Mr Hide said.</p>
