<p>Research affiliate signs with NASDAQ listed company</p>
<p>AUT&#39;s Biotechnology Research Institute partner Kiwi Ingenuity Limited (Kiwi) yesterday (14 July 2005) signed a comprehensive technology licensing agreement with NASDAQ listed (BLUD) Immucor Inc to use Kiwi’s KODE™ technology platform.</p>
<p>Established in 1982, Immucor is a supplier of reagents and equipment to the blood banking industry, and employs around 500 people world-wide. Immucor is now the North American market leader in terms of sales to the blood bank industry and has a strong market position world-wide.</p>
<p>Kiwi Ingenuity Limited, in association with the AUT Biotechnology Research Institute, has developed a range of KODE™ technology platforms, says Kiwi Ingenuity Limited CEO and AUT Professor Steve Henry.</p>
<p>“KODE™ technology allows for the attachment of molecules on to the outside of cells. In the diagnostic transfusion market the controlled attachment of blood group molecules has resulted in a quality control system for blood grouping.</p>
<p>The ABO group system classifies blood into four types: A, B, AB and O. Currently there is no control system for blood-group typing.</p>
<p>“It is very important that people are given the correct blood group – if they aren’t, they could get very ill and potentially die. The development of KODE™ will give testers the chance to use positive and negative controls during blood group typing. This will make the process of typing blood much safer.”</p>
<p>The licensing agreement with Immucor completes the global licensing of Kiwi’s KODE™ technology for the diagnostic transfusion markets. Australian biopharmaceutical company CSL Limited holds the Australasian licences for KODE™ technologies and has already released the in vitro diagnostic product Securacell® into the Australian market. The CSL Securacell® product is the world&#39;s first multi-purpose quality control system for immunohaematology laboratories. Securacell® comes as a kit that is designed to control, standardise and validate all routine immunohaematology tests.</p>
