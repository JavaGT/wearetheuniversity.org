<p>Hui Focus on Maori Economic Development</p>
<p>Maori economic, social and cultural development tops the agenda at the Council of Trade Unions three-day Biennial Hui which starts in Wellington tomorrow.</p>
<p>More than 60 Maori trade unionists from around the country and a range of industries will be welcomed by CTU president Ross Wilson on Te Herenga Waka Marae at Victoria University.</p>
<p>The Minister of Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia, will also address the hui on its opening day.</p>
<p>The hui theme is Te Ara Taumata Mo Nga Kaimahi Maori o Aotearoa, or The Way Forward for Maori Workers in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The hui will focus on the role of unions in improving the well-being of whanau, hapu and iwi through education, skill development, and training opportunities,” Ross Wilson said.</p>
<p>“Many Maori workers are disadvantaged and discriminated against in the workplace, many are low-paid and have been denied opportunities for advancement.</p>
<p>“The hui will come up with strategies to help Maori workers get a fair go.”</p>
<p>The hui will also focus on working towards a union movement that’s based on the partnership principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. The CTU Biennial Conference, scheduled for October, would elect its first Maori vice-president.</p>
<p>“We want to build a union movement that recognises Maori as equal partners and puts Maori issues as a fundamental part of union work,” Ross Wilson said.</p>
