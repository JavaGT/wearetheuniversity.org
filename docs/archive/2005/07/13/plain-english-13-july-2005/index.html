<p>Plain English - 13 July 2005</p>
<p><strong>Local solutions vs. Big Government</strong></p>
<p>Southland Institute of Technology (SIT) and Gore Health were stomped on by the government this week. In both cases, the local communities came up with innovative solutions to unique problems. SIT had to work out how to survive in a shrinking local student market. Gore Health was an answer to 10 years of controversy over the future of the old Seddon Memorial Hospital. Labour don&#39;t like anyone in public service doing it differently than Labour would do it. So the DHB has started the process of driving Gore Health out of business.</p>
<p>They have threatened privately to take over Gore Hospital if they don&#39;t get their way. The DHB has its eye on the Gore Hospital $4 million dollar revenue which they want in their account so they can have a slice of Head office. SIT has long been a target of the other polytechs because they showed them up. While everyone else complains about lack of funding, SIT has dropped fees because of old fashioned careful management. So Labour are writing rules to make it much harder for SIT to offer lower fees.</p>
<p>Local solutions are sustainable solutions. No government can know enough to get all the answers, so National believes local communities should get the chance. Labour can&#39;t stand anyone else on their patch. They want to push Gore Health and SIT back into dependence on bureaucratic whim and politicking.</p>
<p><strong>So When&#39;s The Election?</strong></p>
<p>The only way to stop this corrosion of enterprise and local decision-making is to change the government. Again, Labour look unsure about when to put their neck on the chopping block. Their biggest concern is when they come under real pressure to answer Opposition questions for three weeks. Labour can only avoid 3 weeks of scrutinising by calling an election in the last week of July.</p>
<p>But then there is Helen Clark&#39;s court case for speeding in the PM&#39;s car with her on board. So it&#39;s anyone&#39;s guess and that&#39;s really the point - keep everyone guessing. It will hinge on polling over the next week or so. If Labour see any sign of improvement they will go for August 20th.</p>
<p><strong>National Party Bus Tour</strong></p>
<p>The National Party Bus Tour was launched on Monday 11 July. The bus will be in Balclutha, Gore and finishing up in Invercargill in the afternoon of Thursday 21st July. It is being organised to ensure National&#39;s profile is felt throughout the Country. Our Clutha/Southland Campaign Team needs volunteers for the build up to the election. If you&#39;re able to help, please contact your local office.</p>
