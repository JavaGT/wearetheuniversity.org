<p><strong>Friday, 29 November 2002, 3:21 pm</strong><br><strong>Column: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Right Talk</p>
<p>From the Office of Bill English - 29th November</p>
<p><strong>Wahi Tapu is political correctness gone too far</strong></p>
<p>Over 300 people turned up in Tauranga last night to hear Bill English speak on the Wahi Tapu in Welcome Bay, which is stopping landowners from using their own private property.</p>
<p>&quot;This is Wellington political correctness versus the people, and it has to stop,&quot; he told the meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;And if you think you have got it bad now, then I want to tell you worse is coming round the corner with the new local government law. It will enshrine two standards of citizenship in New Zealand - with ratepayers footing the bill for the privilege.</p>
<p>&quot;National stands squarely for the rights of voters, ratepayers and property owners - because you will pay the price for this Government&#39;s politically correct policies.</p>
<p>&quot;The Historic Places Trust has dozens of applications coming in from around the country. These plans will be &#39;at the expense of private landowners seeking to develop their land&#39; - that&#39;s our legal advice.</p>
<p>&quot;National has an answer. We will scrap the draconian powers of the Historic Places Trust. Instead, Wahi Tapu issues will have to be considered as part of the Resource Management Act.</p>
<p>&quot;National will uphold property rights in the face of political correctness. We will make sure people get a say in decisions that affect their property. National will secure a right of appeal</p>
<p>&quot;We stand for one standard of citizenship and an end to political correctness that divides us,&quot; said Mr English.</p>

<p><strong>The Week In Politics...</strong></p>
<p>* Qantas must be laughing all the way to the bank after the deal they&#39;ve stitched up with Air New Zealand. The bottom line is, less competition means less flights and higher prices.</p>
<p>Air New Zealand needs investment to keep it healthy, but there are plenty of other airlines it could have done a deal with rather than let its main competitor come through the front door.</p>
<p>National has launched a strong campaign to stop the deal, including a website - <a href="http://www.noqantas.co.nz">www.noqantas.co.nz</a> - where you can sign a petition and tell the Government what you think of the deal.</p>
<p>* Gerry Brownlee started National&#39;s nationwide tour to campaign against the Local Government Bill in Dunedin yesterday. A good sized crowd turned out to hear how the Bill enshrines two standards of citizenship with new and unique powers for Maori, and about the extra powers it gives to local councils.</p>
<p>The next meeting is in Wellington this Monday (2nd December), 6:30pm at the Lobby, Dowse Art Gallery, 35-45 Laings Rd Lower Hutt.</p>
<p>* National&#39;s Immigration spokesperson Murray McCully has launched a discussion paper on immigration, with a tighter focus on net benefit for New Zealand. The paper brings balance and reason to the immigration debate, and has a number of proposals such as:</p>
<p>-Increasing the number of migrants in the skilled / business category; -Welfare benefits should not be available to immigrants for at least two years; -Reducing the refugee quota from 750 to 500; -A review of the Samoan quota.</p>
<p>You can read the whole paper and give your opinion at <a href="http://www.national.org.nz/">http://www.national.org.nz/</a></p>
<p>* After months of silence on the rotting homes crisis, Helen Clark finally broke her silence this week - to back George Hawkins, and criticise the media for &quot;banging on about issues of no substance.&quot; Try telling that to the thousands of families living in despair, unable to afford the cost of repairs, or too scared to even investigate.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister&#39;s made a huge gaffe here, underestimating the size of the problem, just like her Minister did.</p>
<p>National has released more documents this week showing the extent of the cover-up, and more revelations have come out of the Select Committee hearing, but still there is no accountability or responsibility. It&#39;s unbelievable that no heads are rolling at the BIA or within the Government yet.</p>
<p>* Finally...George Hawkins has a new nickname around Parliament after more revelations he ignored very obvious warning signs over leaky homes: &quot;Not-So-Curious George&quot;.</p>
