<p><strong>Friday, 15 November 2002, 12:21 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Distinguished English technology academic Professor Warwick Clegg has been appointed to the newly created position of Pro Vice-Chancellor (IT) at Victoria University of Wellington.</p>
<p>As Pro Vice-Chancellor (IT), Professor Clegg will be responsible for academic activities in information technology, Information Technology Services and the Library. Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon says that the position was established in response to the University adopting a greater focus on teaching and research programmes in Information technology.</p>
<p>“The University is delighted to have attracted someone of the calibre of Professor Clegg. We welcome him and anticipate the benefits of his excellent and demonstrated blend of research, teaching and managerial experience,” says Professor McCutcheon.</p>
<p>Professor Clegg comes to Victoria from the University of Plymouth in England. He joined Plymouth in 1996 as a Research Professor and in 1999 was appointed as Professor and Head of the Department of Communication and Electronic Engineering. He is an expert in the area of novel methods of magnetic data storage and advanced instruments, including lasers, for high-resolution magnetic imaging.</p>
<p>A graduate of Liverpool University (BSc Physics, 1967), Professor Clegg went on to complete a PhD in Electrical Engineering (1972) at Manchester University. In 1970 he was appointed there as a lecturer in Electrical Engineering and progressed through management and research roles to become a Reader in Electrical Engineering in 1992.</p>
<p>He has extensive managerial and leadership experience, and has been involved in all aspects of practical and strategic university administration.</p>
<p>“Professor Clegg has played significant roles in the initiation and development of a number of innovative and exciting qualifications at undergraduate and postgraduate levels – most recently on working specifications for an Honours Degree in Technopreneurship. These developments have called on collaboration and a clear vision of the future of information technology and the role it has to play in a changing world.“</p>
<p>He has developed collaborative relationships with major IT industry players around the world. Professor Clegg played a significant role in global IT company Cisco recently selecting the University of Plymouth as one of ten universities in Europe to benefit from access to many of their people and equipment resources.</p>
<p>“Professor Clegg brings interesting ideas and experience on maximising student learning. The University of Plymouth has adopted a particular focus on equipping students with the learning skills that will allow them to take responsibility for their own academic development. Ideas such as these fit well with directions that Victoria is investigating.”</p>
<p>Professor Clegg will take up the role of Pro Vice-Chancellor at Victoria University in early 2003.</p>
