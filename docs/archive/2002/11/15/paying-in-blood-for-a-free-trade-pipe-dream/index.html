<p>Paying in blood for a free trade pipe-dream</p>
<p>New Zealand defence personnel and innocent civilians could pay in blood for the Government&#39;s obsession with a trade deal, Greens Co-leader Rod Donald said today.</p>
<p>&quot;More than six thousand innocent Afghan civilians have died as a result of America&#39;s adventure in Afghanistan,&quot; said Rod Donald. &quot;Some of that blood is unavoidably on the hands of our Government, which wanted to &#39;prove&#39; its commitment to the US in order to secure a free-trade agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;The deployment of SAS troops opened the White House door a crack. Now, we&#39;ve actually got a foot over the threshold, at the cost of a frigate, an Orion and our self respect.</p>
<p>&quot;How much more of our sovereignty will this Government now trade, in order to sit down at the table? Even Helen Clark admits that her eagerness to back America&#39;s war aims has been rewarded with &#39;some revision of the thinking about New Zealand.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt at all that active New Zealand support for and participation in America&#39;s planned invasion of Iraq will win us more favours in Washington. But what would the lives several thousand Iraqi civilians buy us?</p>
<p>&quot;That is the real tragedy of this whole silly, single-minded trade crusade: there is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Our experience of so-called &#39;free trade&#39; deals have been lost jobs, falling exports and duplicity from our &#39;partners.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;Australian union and industry leaders are now pointing out that a US trade deal with their country will put thousands of people out of work,&quot; said Rod Donald. &quot;There is no reason to suggest a deal with the United States would be any more advantageous to us.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, we will merely surrender more of our sovereignty by giving American corporations the right to buy-up whatever they fancy of New Zealand, without any scrutiny by the Overseas Investment Commission.&quot;</p>
