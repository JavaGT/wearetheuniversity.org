<p>New Zealand Business School Joins International Elite</p>
<p>The University of Otago School of Business has been accepted into an elite international consortium of business schools, representing the highest degree of excellence in business administration and management education.</p>
<p>Acceptance into the prestigious PIM (Program in International Management) network was announced at the organisation’s annual conference in Milan on the weekend. The news comes on the heels of the Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU) ranking the Otago MBA in its top 100 MBA programmes in 2002.</p>
<p>Professor David Buisson, Dean of the School of Business and Dr Ian Smith, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Research Enterprise and International, have been in Milan attending the annual PIM conference. PIM is an international consortium of business schools founded in 1973. Membership in the PIM network shows recognition of both the quality and reputation of the institution.</p>
<p>Speaking from Milan after the announcement, Professor Buisson said the membership offers many exciting opportunities for students and faculty.</p>
<p>“This level of achievement reflects upon the excellence of our staff and students and has benefits for the wider NZ community,” he said. “PIM membership cements our position as providing the best business education and business experience for our students, adds to our international reputation and recognition, and supports our initiatives with student exchanges. We couldn’t be happier.”</p>

<p>Dr Smith said joining the PIM network was not only important for the University of Otago, but for the reputation of New Zealand Universities internationally. “Otago’s School of Business has achieved an exceptionally high level of recognition through this membership and has worked hard to secure these opportunities and benefits for students,” he said.</p>
<p>The PIM network was originally established to overcome academic isolation and the logistical obstacles of making student exchanges a reality. Today PIM is a consortium of 44 of the top business schools from around the world.</p>
<p>To become a PIM member the School must meet key membership criteria, including an active graduate-level exchanges with at least 20% of the PIM membership, and an MBA or graduate business program which is top-ranked within their country or region.</p>
<p>Otago’s School of Business has specific international partnership agreements with 20 PIM members, in additional to University-wide agreements and several others pending. Partnerships include Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) in France, the Copenhagen Business School, the University of Texas at Austin – McCombs School of Business, the Hong Kong University of Science &amp; Technology, Universitá Commerciale Luigi Bocconi, Italy and ITAM, Mexico – to name a few - all some of the most prestigious schools around the world.</p>
<p>The successful and well-recognised Otago MBA has also lifted Otago‘s international reputation. In 2001 the programme was ranked in The Financial Times top 100 MBA programmes, and more recently by the Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU), publishers of The Economist newspaper, top 100 MBA programmes in 2002.</p>
