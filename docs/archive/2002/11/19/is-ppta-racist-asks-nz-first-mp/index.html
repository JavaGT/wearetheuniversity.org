<p>Media Release</p>
<p>19 November 2002</p>
<p>&quot;Is PPTA Racist?&quot; - Asks NZ First MP</p>
<p>“The Post-Primary Teachers Association has called for a cap on the numbers of foreign-fee paying students in secondary schools.</p>
<p>“Is this the PPTA being racist?”, asks NZ First education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly.</p>
<p>“Of course it isn’t. It is a sensible suggestion at a time that our country is desperate for secondary teachers. To label PPTA as racist would be as rattle-brained as those critics of NZ First which label us as racist for calling for a limitation of immigration numbers.</p>
<p>“The area of foreign-fee paying students in our schools which are first and foremost there to serve NZ students is an area where there is a desperate need for clear policy. NZ First supports the PPTA recommendation as an interim measure while that work is being done,” said Mr Donnelly.</p>
<p>“It is to be noted that the numbers of such students have leapt from 4128 in 1999 to 9498 in 2002, during a period when secondary schools have been hit by the population bulge”.</p>
