<p>Bill English National Party Leader</p>
<p>19 November 2002</p>
<p>National defines principles over breakfast</p>
<p>National Party leader Bill English has launched a wide ranging attack on the Government&#39;s politically correct initiatives and outlined his Party&#39;s principles at a breakfast meeting in Wellington.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand doesn&#39;t face a crisis, we face something much more difficult - a gradual erosion of ethics in Government. &quot;We&#39;re seeing a creeping incompetence in our public services - debt ridden strike ridden hospitals and school students who can&#39;t trust the exam system,&quot; Mr English told the Institute of Directors.</p>
<p>He&#39;s also used the breakfast to set out what the National Party stands for.</p>
<p>&quot;We stand for enterprise, we stand for personal responsibility.</p>
<p>&quot;We stand for strong families and communities, we stand for freedom and choice, we stand for limited Government.</p>
<p>&quot;We stand for one standard of citizenship - one rule for all and we stand for national and personal security,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>Mr English also targeted the Local Government Bill due to be pushed through Parliament under urgency before Christmas.</p>
<p>It paves the way for wider consultation with Maori and special Maori seats on local authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the biggest constitutional change since the introduction of MMP.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has lost its way on the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government can&#39;t and won&#39;t sort it out so it&#39;s passing the job on to your council.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no discussion, no direction, no leadership - just corrosive political correctness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Treaty created one standard of citizenship, the Government is destroying that ideal</p>
<p>&quot;Measures that undermine our democracy must be challenged, they must be tested, and if necessary, changed,&quot; Mr English says.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s been a slow stifling of political debate - people scared to say what they think because the Government will punish them.</p>
<p>He says the volunteer movement showed how effective it can be when it responded in droves to National&#39;s campaign against OSH legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like we&#39;ve won a partial back down on this issue and we haven&#39;t finished yet,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
