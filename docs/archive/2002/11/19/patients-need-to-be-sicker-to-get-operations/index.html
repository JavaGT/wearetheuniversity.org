<p><strong>Tuesday, 19 November 2002, 4:18 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Dr Lynda Scott National Health Spokesperson</p>
<p>19 November 2002</p>
<p>Patients need to be sicker to get operations</p>
<p>New Zealanders now need to be sicker to get an operation than they had to be a year ago, National Health Spokesperson Dr Lynda Scott revealed today.</p>
<p>Dr Scott told Parliament that hospitals have been increasing the points required, the Financially Sustainable Thresholds (FSTs), for patients to qualify for operations.</p>
<p>&quot;We have already seen this happening in the Hawkes Bay and Otago.</p>
<p>&quot;It is also happening at Mid Central Health where the points for a hip replacement increased a large amount from 65 to 90, and the points for cataracts increased from 20 to 29 between the years 2001-02 and 2002-03.</p>
<p>&quot;These district health boards are raising the points because they simply can&#39;t afford to perform the operations and deliver the services. Older New Zealanders are particularly at risk of needing to be significantly more disabled before they qualify for surgery. &quot;Basically patients have to be sicker to get treatment. The Health Minister must answer why this is happening and what she will be doing to stop it.</p>
<p>&quot;It was disappointing today in Parliament that she fobbed off my question about why this is happening at Mid Central Health,&quot; Dr Scott said.</p>
