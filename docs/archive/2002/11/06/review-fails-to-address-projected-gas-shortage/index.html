<p>Review fails to address projected gas shortage</p>
<p>National’s welcoming the review of the New Zealand gas sector but warns that it fails to address projected power shortages in a little more than a decade.</p>
<p>“It seems appropriate to proceed in an environment of co-operation between the industry and Government, but there’s quite some way to go,” says National’s Energy spokesman Gerry Brownlee.</p>
<p>“We’re disappointed the gas review didn’t cover the crucial area of exploration, when the industry’s own figures show there’ll be a big gap between demand and supply by 2015,” says Mr Brownlee.</p>
<p>Shell Oil says by 2015 the country will need about 180 peta joules of gas each year when New Zealand will only be producing around 120 peta joules.</p>
<p>Even the Centre for Advance Engineering at Canterbury University warns of a similar scenario in its October review of New Zealand’s future electricity needs.</p>
<p>“Therefore, we disagree with the suggestion that gas fired electricity generation is likely to be the most cost-effective large scale energy source for medium term new generation capacity.</p>
<p>“The industry’s still projecting those big gas shortages even after adding in supplies from 10 unproven fields,” says Mr Brownlee.</p>
<p>“Of course basic economics will also apply - the gas price is expected to more than triple and that’s bound to have an impact on the price of electricity.</p>
<p>“And, perhaps most disturbing of all, is that none of these reports take into account the prospect of a ‘dry year’, with little or no rain, when our hydro generators can’t operate at full capacity,” Mr Brownlee says.</p>
