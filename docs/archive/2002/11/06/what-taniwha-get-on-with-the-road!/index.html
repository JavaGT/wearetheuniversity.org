<p>What taniwha? Get on with the road!</p>
<p>Maurice Williamson sought leave in Parliament today for the House to order Transit NZ to re-start construction of the Waikato expressway, but the move was blocked by the Government. The work has been halted because of concerns that there is a taniwha in the area.</p>
<p>Mr Williamson said that a Mr Mike Timmins had written to today’s Herald advising that he had ‘shot the bastard’ a couple of nights ago.</p>
<p>“That man deserves a medal. He has solved the problem for the Government. Now lets get the motorway finished,” said Mr Williamson.</p>
<p>“Far too much time and money has already been wasted on this politically correct madness. The Government had an opportunity today to stop the mucking around and get on with the job. Instead it has put a mythical taniwha ahead of economic development. What a farce.”</p>
