<p><strong>Wednesday, 6 November 2002, 11:35 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>United Future can’t have it both ways</p>
<p>United Future is obviously confused over the government’s legislative programme if last night’s vote against the second reading of the Climate Change Response Bill is any example, says National Agriculture spokesman, David Carter.</p>
<p>“United wants to have it both ways. On the one hand, it continues to support and maintain a Labour Government in office, while on the other it votes against the Government’s legislative programme.</p>
<p>“United has already indicated it won’t be supporting other significant legislation that has yet to pass, such as the Health and Safety in Employment Amendment Bill, the Television New Zealand Bill and the Tertiary Education Reform Bill.</p>
<p>“It voted last night for the Department of Labour to have the money to implement the yet to be passed OSH legislation, the very legislation its leader’s described as being on the lunatic fringe of law-making. That’s irrational.</p>
<p>“So much for the common sense party. Peter Dunne needs to be asked why he continues to support Labour when his party appears so fundamentally opposed to Labour’s philosophy,” says Mr Carter.</p>
