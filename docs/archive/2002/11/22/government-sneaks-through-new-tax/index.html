<p>Government Sneaks Through New Tax</p>
<p>The Government is about to use tacked-on legislation to introduce a new tax for motor vehicle traders under urgency this afternoon, ACT Commerce Spokesman Deborah Coddington revealed.</p>
<p>&quot;Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard has sneaked a Supplementary Order Paper into the Motor Vehicle Sales Bill - which I understand only ACT will oppose when it is debated under urgency this afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been no consultation on this new compulsory levy - it was never raised at Select Committee.</p>
<p>&quot;This Bill been around since 1998 yet Ms Tizard has only this week tacked on the levy. We don&#39;t even know how much it will cost vehicle dealers - it can simply be raised overnight at the whim of the Labour Government executive.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a Government that loves hitting business where it hurts. This Government spells tax `l - e - v - y&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Last week the Government passed the Climate Change Response Act, which threatens farmers with their own compulsory levy. And Labour is also planning an export education levy, although at least in that case, those that will be hit have been given time to comment. Victoria University used this opportunity to deliver a devastating attack against the Government&#39;s plans.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT New Zealand vehemently opposes this new tax and the deceitful way it is being introduced,&quot; Miss Coddington said.  </p>
