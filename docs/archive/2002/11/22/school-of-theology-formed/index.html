<p>School Of Theology Formed  </p>
<p>A School of Theology headed by a professor is being established at The University of Auckland.</p>
<p>The School builds on the partnership through which the Auckland Consortium for Theological Education (ACTE) and the University have offered theological degrees and diplomas since 1990.</p>
<p>The four ACTE members — Carey Baptist College, the Catholic Institute of Theology, the College of St John the Evangelist (Anglican) and Trinity Methodist Theological College — signed a memorandum of agreement with the University today.</p>
<p>The new structure has been set up to strengthen the education, research and scholarship which they jointly provide. Academic staff employed by the theological colleges will continue to teach courses in Theology as part of the School which the University will administer at its City Campus.</p>
<p>Professor Elaine Wainwright from Brisbane has been appointed to the chair in Theology and will take up her position in January 2003.</p>
<p>The University&#39;s Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic), Professor Raewyn Dalziel, said the School with a professor at the head raised Theology&#39;s standing within the University.</p>
<p>&quot;The academic expertise on which we draw for our teaching in Theology is outstanding,&quot; she said. &quot;Creation of the School takes the study of Theology to a new and exciting stage.&quot;</p>
<p>The School would strengthen links between those involved in the partnership, said Professor Dalziel, and enhance their status, individually and jointly.</p>
<p>• In 2002 there are 154 students taking the Bachelor of Theology, 19 the Graduate Diploma in Theology or the Master of Theology, and 12 PhD students (all figures EFTS).</p>
