<p>Winston Peters address to First National Real Estate Consultants at Armitage Hotel Tauranga. “Does Anyone Know What’s Happening?”</p>
<p>It’s sometimes interesting to listen to the radio talkback shows to find out what people think about what’s going on in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The politically correct say that talkback shows are for the ignorant and bigoted – but I am not so sure.</p>
<p>They are a good outlet for people to point out the absurdity of certain things and to express their feelings about issues that affect them.</p>
<p>If you’ve listened to the talkbacks in recent weeks, New Zealand has been hit by an overdose of absurdity and human nature.</p>
<p>We are certainly living in strange times.</p>
<p>They remind me of a TV show some years ago in which the late Malcolm Muggeridge was interviewed about his time as editor of the satirical Punch magazine.</p>
<p>Muggeridge explained that they wrote a satirical piece about an impending visit by the Soviet leader Krushev to Britain.</p>
<p>They had to drop the article when they found out that what they had written as a fictitious itinerary turned out to be almost the exact details of Krushev’s visit!</p>
<p>Punch would have a field day in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Only this week we learned that a swamp dwelling taniwha has stopped work on part of the Waikato expressway near Meremere.</p>
<p>Members of a local iwi had thoughtfully provided this information to Transit New Zealand.</p>
<p>One resident has pointed out that by building the road, Transit is trampling on Maori culture.</p>
<p>This expressway is being built to reduce the road toll and improve a notorious stretch of road.</p>
<p>Advertisement - scroll to continue reading</p>
<p>It appears that the authorities have been taking the wrong tack all along because local Maori have pointed out that fatal crashes on State Highway One were linked to the taniwha.</p>
<p>So instead of building roads, we perhaps should embark on a taniwha eradication programme. All our roads might become safer!</p>
<p>Some time ago the Australian authorities had a similar case. An aborigine woman objecting to a bridge said it was an area of spiritual significance so important that it could not even be mentioned.</p>
<p>Fortunately the day was saved by other aborigine laughing her out of court.</p>
<p>In yet another piece of bureaucratic nonsense in this country, the Internal Affairs Department started warning everyone last week about breaking the law over taking a flutter in a Melbourne Cup sweepstake.</p>
<p>With all the problems in the country you’d think that some bureaucrat would have better to do than try to spoil a bit of fun on Melbourne Cup day.</p>
<p>Every workplace across Australasia has traditionally held sweepstakes on Melbourne Cup day.</p>
<p>Just about everybody has a flutter. But under this Government fun is no laughing matter.</p>
<p>George Orwell could have written another book called 2002 to go along with 1984.</p>
<p>But instead of Big Brother we have Big Sister watching over us.</p>
<p>That’s the way things are going these days.</p>
<p>Nobody is safe. Take the new health and safety legislation.</p>
<p>Some bureaucrat somewhere is probably working out how to prosecute Santa Claus for causing stress to the elf workers at the North Pole in the lead up to Christmas.</p>
<p>Under new legislation, employers can face a fine of up to $500,000 for causing stress to workers.</p>
<p>Yet immigrants are setting up sweat shops here with impunity. The same legislation sets a fine of $200,000 if volunteers for an organisation get hurt in an accident.</p>
<p>We are living in some kind of ga-ga land.</p>
<p>Someone should tell these sickly, chardonnay sipping, lemon sucking liberal reformers that New Zealand is virtually run by volunteers.</p>
<p>The girls’ mafia that runs the country does not know that fact. Everybody else does.</p>
<p>This is a major problem with this government.</p>
<p>We have a bunch of ivory tower technocrats sitting in the Beehive working from some kind of textbook about socio-liberal reform.</p>
<p>This humorless bunch of do-gooders are making New Zealand the most politically correct nation on earth.</p>
<p>Next thing we won’t be allowed to laugh at jokes that have not been approved by the anti-fun police.</p>
<p>It’s a real worry!</p>
<p>On a more serious vein, you asked me to slant the topic of my talk to the rural industry.</p>
<p>In New Zealand First we have always recognised that farming is the economic backbone of the country.</p>
<p>No matter what some Wellington-dwelling child-economists tell you, we will always depend on what we produce or harvest from the land and the sea.</p>
<p>This is why we should always protect our land, restrain urban sprawl and husband our resources in the seas that surround us.</p>
<p>All of you associated with the land know about these things. Just about every farmer and fisherman (I mean fisherperson) knows that without proper use of natural resources, we face a very bleak future.</p>
<p>In New Zealand we have about four million people. Countries of a similar size like Britain and Japan have many times our number.</p>
<p>Some people think we should also have a much higher population.</p>
<p>They say that is what is wrong with us.</p>
<p>That we don’t have a big enough domestic market to provide a base for manufactured exports.</p>
<p>New Zealand First disagrees with that philosophy and we suspect that most New Zealanders, if asked, would agree with us.</p>
<p>We can be world beaters with four million people but only if we stick to what we do best.</p>
<p>We CAN and should maintain our proper place in an uncertain world in which everyone is now looking over their shoulders waiting for the next terrorist attack.</p>
<p>One of the biggest flaws in the policies of the present Government is the way population manipulation is being used as an economic tool.</p>
<p>Instead of concentrating on the basics – what we are good at - this Government is bringing in more than a thousand immigrants a week to create economic development and consumer demand.</p>
<p>The numbers get higher every month.</p>
<p>The Government cheerleaders are always claiming that immigrants bring in the skills and talents critical for economic growth</p>
<p>However, the simple fact is that a large proportion of migrants do not bring skills.</p>
<p>Many are not selected on the basis of employability or other human capacity.</p>
<p>Of the 55,000 who settled in the past year - a third of that total - about 17,000 people - came in under categories other than on the basis of skills – for example family ties or other reasons such as refugee status.</p>
<p>This is an alarming statistic.</p>
<p>A third of those we granted residence status did not contribute to our celebrated skill shortage</p>
<p>So for every two migrants who were selected on skills – and that is highly debatable - we added another migrant on some other basis</p>
<p>What sort of a rational immigration policy is that?</p>
<p>It is no reflection on those people who entered New Zealand on a basis other than their skills to ask what is happening here?</p>
<p>What contribution to growth are these people supposed to make?</p>
<p>Because the reality is that such people make an immediate demand on housing, health and other services and infrastructure.</p>
<p>The immigration explosion in the Auckland area is causing major problems.</p>
<p>The place is bursting at the seams.</p>
<p>When we raise these issues we are immediately accused of being racists!</p>
<p>In the context of economic growth it is important to realise that just having education and skills does not immediately transform a person into being part of a productive workforce.</p>
<p>According to the Department of Labour briefing papers, the rate at which new migrants are employed is relatively poor.</p>
<p>The Department describes the recent rise to a rate of 50 percent employment as an improvement. In other words 50 percent of recent migrants are unemployed!</p>
<p>But there is good news</p>
<p>We are informed that after a period of about 10 years the outcomes of new migrants begin to converge with those of New Zealand residents.</p>
<p>Ten years! And countless millions of dollars later – all paid for by courtesy of the long suffering taxpayer.</p>
<p>Those are not facts New Zealand First has invented.</p>
<p>They are from the official briefing papers.</p>
<p>The immigration boom is having a direct impact on the rural community. The Reserve Bank has lifted interest rates four times this year.</p>
<p>The pressure of immigration is one of the major factors behind these interest rate rises.</p>
<p>Check the Governor’s statements on the website.</p>
<p>There is another, more sinister aspect of this immigration debacle and that is New Zealand’s border security is so lax that we possibly have terrorists in our country right now.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Immigration Service does not carry out rigorous checks.</p>
<p>All types of people are getting into the country through our open door policy.</p>
<p>Australia is very firm in the way it deals with asylum seekers and so-called refugees.</p>
<p>It keeps them detained until they are checked out.</p>
<p>That is why the Tampa boatpeople were not allowed in.</p>
<p>Australia knew that if it allowed anyone from the Tampa to step on Australian soil, there would have been an invasion of boatpeople.</p>
<p>What did our government do? Take in 150 of them.</p>
<p>It has since transpired that only seven of 292 Afghans off the Tampa were genuine refugees. This information came from the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees.</p>
<p>So who have we brought into the country? Will we ever know?</p>
<p>This situation is intolerable.</p>
<p>The safety of New Zealanders should be the first priority of any government – yet Labour places our security well behind its programme of political and ethnic engineering.</p>
<p>Labour unashamedly targets the ethnic communities for votes. One of the MPs confirmed this in her local newspaper just after the election. The MP was Anne Hartley.</p>
<p>The Immigration Service is one of the more dysfunctional arms of bureaucracy. The Immigration Service estimates there are 1759 asylum seekers who are still in New Zealand illegally.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that. There are 1,759 asylum seekers who are still in New Zealand illegally. That’s on top of the thousands of overstayers.</p>
<p>How can you lose 1,759 illegal asylum seekers? Surely they can be checked through the welfare system because you can bet your bottom dollar they will be getting paid a benefit.</p>
<p>Who are these people? Is there a terrorist amongst them?</p>
<p>The Bali bombings were very close to home.</p>
<p>No matter what sort of spin the Government tries to put on this immigration debacle, its lack of border control and security is placing every New Zealander at risk.</p>
<p>New Zealand First does not want to be proved right over this serious issue. We don’t want it to be swept under the carpet.</p>
<p>The security and safety of New Zealanders is at stake.</p>
