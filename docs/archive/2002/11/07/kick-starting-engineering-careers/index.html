<p>Kick Starting engineering careers</p>
<p>The School of Engineering at The University of Auckland is offering 22 Kick Start scholarships to first year engineering students in 2003.</p>
<p>The scholarships are to assist engineering students “kick start” their studies with a financial grant of $2000 to help with initial ‘set-up’ costs such as textbooks, fees and accommodation.</p>
<p>The School of Engineering Dean, Professor Peter Brothers says the Kick Start scholarships were introduced in 1999 with the aim of making life easier for engineering students entering the university environment for the first time.</p>
<p>“We understand that beginning tertiary study can be daunting for some students and the Scholarships will go some way towards making this transition easier,” he says.</p>
<p>There are three types of scholarships available:</p>
<p>Kick Start Merit Scholarships – eight scholarships Kick Start City of Sails Scholarships – ten scholarships Kick Start Affirmative Action Scholarships – four scholarships</p>
<p>The Kick Start Merit Scholarships will be awarded to the applicants with the highest Bursary totals. These scholarships are open to students from across New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Kick Start City of Sails Scholarships are open to students who live beyond the Auckland metropolitan area. This area is classified as north of Orewa or South of Drury.</p>
<p>The Kick Start Affirmative Action Scholarships are open to students of Maori or Pacific Island descent.</p>
<p>Applications for the Kick Start scholarships close on 8 December, 2002. Details and applications can be obtained from school careers advisors or on the School of Engineering website http:// <a href="http://www.engineering.auckland.ac.nz">http://www.engineering.auckland.ac.nz</a> .</p>
