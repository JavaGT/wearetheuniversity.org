<p><strong>Wednesday, 13 November 2002, 9:34 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association">Victoria University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Summer school financial necessity for students</p>
<p>Record numbers of students are enrolling in Victoria University summer school this year, but student representatives warn that many may be doing so in order to maintain an income over the summer months.</p>
<p>“Many students are enrolled in summer school in order to ensure that they receive living costs from the student loan scheme because the government no longer provides the Emergency Unemployment Benefit for students who cannot find work over the summer,” said Fleur Fitzsimons, President of the Victoria University Students’ Association.</p>
<p>VUWSA is concerned that no break between a stressful exam period and further study could be putting students under too much pressure, and be effecting the quality of their learning, as well as their mental and physical health.</p>
<p>“The University may be exceeding it’s own enrolment targets for the second year running,” said Fitzsimons. “But they must also ensure that they have robust mechanisms for assessing the quality of summer courses. Students and staff must have the opportunity to give feedback on the future of summer school.”</p>
<p>VUWSA will continue to support those students with no income over summer with its food bank and welfare services. “We’ll also continue to provide support and advice to students who find summer school hard going after a long year, or who are worried about the quality of their courses. And we will continue to fight for an unemployment benefit for students who can’t find work over summer.”</p>
