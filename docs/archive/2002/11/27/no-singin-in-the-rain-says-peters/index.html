<p><strong>Wednesday, 27 November 2002, 11:52 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>No Singin&#39; In The Rain Says Peters</p>
<p>New Zealand First has urged Labour to spend its third birthday in office reflecting on the failure of designer politics rather than celebrating in the rain.</p>
<p>Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters said today that the Labour-led minority Government of 2002 was a pale reflection of the great Labour governments of the past.</p>
<p>“For example, it would be hard to imagine Savage, Fraser or Kirk running for cover over the leaking building problem – or allowing tens of thousands of unqualified migrants into the country.</p>
<p>“As Labour MPs eat their sausages and soggy bread and sip their chardonnay, they should also reflect on the fact that twenty percent of their fellow New Zealanders are living in poverty.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters said that it would be entirely appropriate for ACT and United Future to join the birthday barbecue because Douglas, Prebble, Shirley and Dunne were all part of the wreckers’ class of 1984-90.</p>
<p>“These were the people who turned New Zealand upside down in a disastrous social and economic experiment. These fellow-travelers should all be standing in the rain at the barbecue.”</p>
