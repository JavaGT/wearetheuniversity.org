<p>Labour?s Sentencing Act Strikes Again</p>
<p>Yesterday&#39;s paltry sentence for a schoolteacher who preyed upon his pupils highlights the dramatic failures in the Government&#39;s sentencing laws, ACT Justice Spokesman Stephen Franks said today.</p>
<p>&quot;East Coast teacher Euan Hovell preyed upon his pupils for 23 years and pleaded guilty to 77 charges - many representing multiple offences conducted behind his desk while students were in session. His offending means he is one of the country&#39;s worst convicted paedophiles - yet he may be free to walk the streets within two years.</p>
<p>&quot;When asked by the crown prosecutors to lift the penalty, Justice Priestly made it clear that the Government&#39;s new sentencing laws prevented him giving Hovell a minimum jail term. He said that, because Hovell&#39;s `serious&#39; offences did not include serious violence, he would be eligible for parole after two years. The judge declined to comment further on sentencing provisions.</p>
<p>&quot;These crimes blight entire communities. Had the Government accepted ACT&#39;s amendments to the sentencing legislation, the judge could have set a minimum non-parole period that would have expressed the community&#39;s denunciation. Instead, he can&#39;t fit a sentence to the crime.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has failed in its fundamental duty to protect its citizens. Nevertheless, it may work out in its favour - paedophiles with sentences less than three years can still vote Labour - even from prison,&quot; said Mr Franks.  </p>
