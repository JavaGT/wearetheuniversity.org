<p>Government Kickbacks Break Their Own Law</p>
<p>ACT Justice spokesman Stephen Franks said today that IRD and other government department payments to employees simply because they are members of the PSA is in breach of section 9 of the Employment Relations Act.</p>
<p>&quot;In section 9 Prohibition on preference - subsection (1) says:</p>
<p>A contract, agreement, or other arrangement between persons must not confer on a person, because the person is or is not a member of a union or a particular union, - ...</p>
<p>(b) any preference in relation to terms or conditions of employment ...</p>
<p>(2) Subsection (1) is not breached simply because an employee&#39;s employment agreement or terms and conditions of employment are different from those of another employee employed by the same employer.</p>
<p>&quot;The causal nexus between the union membership and the payment makes subsection (2) irrelevant.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard said &quot;the Government had made it clear in May 2000 when it signed up to a Partnership for Quality Programme with the PSA that it recognised the benefits unions brought to the sector. The payments, which feature in a number of collective agreements, recognised the role the unions played in improving the quality and efficiency of services delivered to taxpayers and in staff working conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Imagine what the Hon Margaret Wilson would say if a private company gave an extra $800 a year reward to non-union employees, because of a view that employees who were not members of a union improved the quality and efficiency of services delivered to shareholders.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope the employees who have suffered this discrimination take it to the Employment Court,&quot; Mr Franks said.  </p>
