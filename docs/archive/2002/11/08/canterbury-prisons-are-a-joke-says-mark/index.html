<p>Canterbury Prisons Are A Joke Says Mark</p>
<p>New Zealand First Corrections Spokesperson Ron Mark is calling for an enquiry into the management of Canterbury prisons.</p>
<p>“The region’s prison service is a disaster,” says Mr Mark.</p>
<p>“How can the people of Canterbury have any confidence in the prison service after a violent sex offender serving preventative detention was able to escape and remain on the loose in the community for two days?” questioned Mr Mark.</p>
<p>“His escape reads like a bad novel.</p>
<p>“There was clearly a serious lack of adequate and professional supervision at Paparua Prison which a dangeous sexual predator was able to take full advantage of,” he said.</p>
<p>“Consider this escape alongside other recent failures of the area’s Corrections Department – the illegal and bizarre antics of the ‘Goon Squad’, grievances from disgruntled prison officers which are still winding their way through the employment court and the drug overdose death of an inmate after he was permitted day release at the home of a woman with known drug connections.</p>
<p>“Canterbury’s prison management is not up to the task,” said Mr Mark.</p>
<p>“The last Minister of Corrections Matt Robson was hopeless in that he failed to do anything. Minister Goshe must act now and order a full enquiry into the running of Christchurch’s prison services.”</p>
