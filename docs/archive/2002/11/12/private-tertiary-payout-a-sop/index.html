<p>Private tertiary payout a sop</p>
<p>The Tertiary Education Commission’s allocation of $17 million to private providers is a lame attempt to make up for the huge damage the Government has caused to the sector, says National’s Tertiary education spokesman Simon Power.</p>
<p>“The Government imposed a moratorium on funding for private providers, halting any expansion, and is threatening to impose more controls on them with new legislation. This meagre fund is a pathetic attempt at placating them.</p>
<p>“130 Private Training Establishments submitted proposals totalling over $62 million, but only 48 were lucky enough to gain allocations totalling $16.8 million. The Government should explain why some missed out, and how this will affect students.</p>
<p>“More and more students are relying on private providers to better themselves and gain qualifications. &gt;From 2000 to 2001 there was a 31.9% growth in students at private institutes, and 32.2% of students enrolled are Maori.</p>
<p>“It is unfair for students and institutes in the private sector to continually miss out. The issue should be about quality of service, not ownership structure,” said Mr Power.</p>
