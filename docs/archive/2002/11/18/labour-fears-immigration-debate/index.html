<p>Labour Fears Immigration Debate</p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters says Lianne Dalziel is suffering from a form of amnesia known as “selective memory” over immigration issues.</p>
<p>Ms Dalziel publicly claimed today that Mr Peters has refused to debate the issue but he reminded her that the Prime Minister refused a debate last week on the grounds that she did not want to give him a platform for his views.</p>
<p>“The Minister is very forgetful about immigration matters. She also kept denying there were any problems when I drew her attention to false job offers, false English language certificates and other immigration scams.</p>
<p>“Her only response was to chant Labour’s mantra accusing me of racism. Yet since the election Labour has raised the points system for immigrants, launched a police inquiry into immigration fraud, and is now reviewing just about every part of immigration policy.</p>
<p>“Lianne Dalziel now has so much egg on her face over her immigration nonsense she is starting to look like an omelette.</p>
<p>“During the election campaign we promised New Zealand we would fix the immigration problems and we are delivering with our policy.</p>
<p>“Four months later Labour is changing the system to meet our challenge and the Prime Minister is working on damage control.</p>
<p>“The pity is that taxpayers are continuing to bear the cost of tens of thousands of immigrants who have already entered New Zealand under Labour and National’s disastrous policies,” said Mr Peters.</p>
