<p>University of Auckland environmental law centre a world leader</p>
<p>The New Zealand Centre for Environmental Law (NZCEL) at The University of Auckland has been named as one of six world Centres of Excellence in environmental law by the IUCN (the world’s largest intergovernmental organisation for environmental conservation). Together with the other five centres it will be a founding member of the new IUCN Academy of Environmental Law.</p>
<p>“I am delighted to see NZCEL’s work recognised at the highest international level,” says Associate Professor Klaus Bosselmann, Director of NZCEL.</p>
<p>“It has been named as the leading environmental law centre for the Oceanic-Pacific region.”</p>
<p>The importance of law in tackling sustainability issues and the need for a world academy was highlighted at the recent UN World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>As the first international academic consortium of its kind, the IUCN Academy of Environmental Law will be the world’s foremost research and teaching centre for environmental law.</p>
<p>It will initiate research projects, taught courses, an annual conference and an annual publication. It is expected to become fully operational by 2005.</p>
<p>The five other Centres of Excellence, which will also be founding members of the Academy, are: University College London (Centre for Law and the Environment), Pace University School of Law (New York), National University of Singapore (Asia Pacific Centre for Environmental Law), Kuwait University (Arab Regional Centre for Environmental Law) and University of Rio Grande del Sur (Brazil).</p>

<p>Members of NZCEL carry out consultancy work for government agencies around the world, including for the European Union and United Nations Environment Programme, as well as for the New Zealand government.  </p>
