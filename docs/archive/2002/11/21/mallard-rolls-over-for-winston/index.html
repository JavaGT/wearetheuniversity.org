<p>Mallard Rolls Over For Winston</p>
<p>Education Minister Trevor Mallard has committed his most cowardly and unprincipled act yet in endorsing the call by New Zealand First for a cap on foreign student numbers, ACT Education Spokesman Donna Awatere Huata said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard has ignored the facts and sold his own values to win back votes from a bunch of populist, unprincipled politicians.</p>
<p>&quot;Our country is not flooded with foreign students.</p>
<p>&quot;This move is not just blatantly anti-Asian, it is anti-New Zealand. Export education brings over one billion dollars to New Zealand every year. This income funds opportunities for every child that we&#39;d otherwise lack. Foreign fee-paying students bring diversity and life to our classrooms. They are welcome.</p>
<p>&quot;After his time in office, I have very low expectations of Mr Mallard, but even those were let down today. I will wait to see what sort of &quot;cap&quot; or &quot;halt&quot; he proposes, but I promise the Minister that ACT New Zealand will fight tooth-and-nail any measure to bring race-based quotas to our classrooms,&quot; Mrs Awatere Huata said.  </p>
