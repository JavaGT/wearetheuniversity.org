<p>Mallard Makes Life Harder for Foreign Students</p>
<p>The Education Minister is worsening a difficult situation for foreign students by remaining silent while unions make strident attacks on their presence in New Zealand schools, ACT Education Spokesman Donna Awatere Huata said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard didn&#39;t respond yesterday when secondary teachers&#39; union (PPTA) president Jen McCutcheon called for a &quot;cap&quot; on foreign fee-paying student numbers. But surely he must act today in response to the primary teachers&#39; union&#39;s (NZEI) even more extreme call for a &quot;halt&quot; to foreign fee-paying student enrolments.</p>
<p>&quot;The primary teachers&#39; union wants these kids&#39; enrolments to be halted at least until the mixture of cultures can be produced &quot;in a planned way, not the ad hoc approach that&#39;s happening now&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;In other words, this union wants to dictate how many children of each culture are in a classroom. The image of Government and unions dictating racial quotas for schools is an extremely repugnant one.</p>
<p>&quot;Ministry of Education figures supplied to me by the PPTA show foreign fee-paying students make up one percent of primary schools. In fact, the vast majority of primary schools don&#39;t even have a single foreign fee-paying student. The 335 schools that do have an average of five students each.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard&#39;s silence deeply worries me. I sincerely hope the Minister will not sacrifice his values - and one billion dollars worth of income - because his Government is panicked by the New Zealand First party.</p>

<p>&quot;If the secondary teachers&#39; union wants to become PPTA First, or NZEI wants to affiliate itself to the Winston Peters fan club, then the organisations&#39; membership numbers will suffer as a result. But Mr Mallard has no excuse for tagging along.</p>
<p>&quot;The Education Minister may think that remaining silent has no consequences, because foreign students don&#39;t vote in New Zealand elections. But if he continues to remain silent in the face of such ill-judged calls from unions, he will make life harder and harder for the kids from overseas who are already in this country&#39;s schools,&quot; Mrs Awatere Huata said.</p>
