<p>PPTA Gets In Bed With Populist Politicians</p>
<p>Wednesday 20 Nov 2002 Donna Awatere Huata Press Releases -- Education</p>
<p>The call from the secondary school teachers&#39; union for fewer foreign fee paying students is misleading, crude and short-sighted, ACT Education Spokesman Donna Awatere Huata said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Union president Ms McCutcheon may find the current climate receptive to her views on export education, but unfortunately - like the politicians she emulates - she has forgotten to tell the full story.</p>
<p>&quot;Our country&#39;s 9,498 foreign fee-paying students represent less than two percent of the total number of children in New Zealand schools.</p>
<p>&quot;Have some schools attracted more fee-paying students than others? Naturally. Generally schools with more foreign students have developed excellent, sophisticated programmes to attract and retain these kids on the school roll.</p>
<p>&quot;The crude message delivered by Ms McCutcheon and backed up by a populist, ill-informed politician is that &quot;our&quot; children - New Zealand kids - will miss out because of &quot;their&quot; kids. Scratch the surface and there is a very ugly sentiment that any truly open-minded New Zealander would find extremely distasteful. I am glad that Ms McCutcheon isn&#39;t in a classroom delivering that lesson to my children.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Government were to follow Ms McCutcheon&#39;s advice and place an arbitrary limit on the number of foreign students, every child would miss out - not just on the positive benefits that a mixture of cultures brings to the classroom, but also on the opportunities that one billion dollars of income can buy. That&#39;s the amount that export education brings to our country, and it is a figure that Ms McCutcheon wants to `cap&#39;. That&#39;s short-sighted and self-defeating.</p>
<p>&quot;I sincerely hope that Ms McCutcheon is just musing aloud - I find it hard to believe that someone in her position could seriously contemplate sending a message to foreign students that they are unwelcome,&quot; Mrs Awatere Huata said.</p>
