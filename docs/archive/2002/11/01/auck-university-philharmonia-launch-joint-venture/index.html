<p>University of Auckland and Auckland Philharmonia launch joint venture</p>
<p>The Auckland Philharmonia and The University of Auckland School of Music today announced the formation of AP~SOM, a collaboration designed to enhance and strengthen the musical endeavours of both organisations in Auckland and throughout the country.</p>
<p>Dean of the Arts Faculty, Professor Douglas Sutton and Auckland Philharmonia General Manager Anne Rodda agree that the University and Philharmonia have many complementary skills as well as a large range of resources in music performance and study. By bringing these two organisations together under the AP~SOM umbrella, it is envisaged that an environment of innovative and inspired learning and performing will be provided.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Helen Clark, says it is encouraging to see organisations within the arts sector pooling their resources for maximum effect.</p>
<p>&quot;The formation of AP~SOM appears to be leading the way for established organisations to work creatively in a complementary manner to improve the high standard of music training already available in New Zealand,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>AP~SOM’s agreement takes into account the sharing of physical resources such as music libraries, instruments and personnel, and extends to a wide range of activities including:</p>
<p>· joint concerts<br>· summer and winter courses<br>· masterclasses by visiting guest artists<br>· workshops for conductors and composers<br>· workshops in new, experimental music<br>· ourses in orchestral training and preparedness<br>· internships<br>· competitions<br>· community and continuing education.</p>
<p>A graduate programme in orchestral studies is being developed as an exciting new initiative within this relationship.</p>
