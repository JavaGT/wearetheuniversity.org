<p><strong>Friday, 23 August 2002, 4:18 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Tony Ryall National Police Spokesperson</p>
<p>23 August 2002</p>
<p>Glenfield police station closure just the beginning</p>
<p>The proposed Glenfield Police Station closure is just another example of the Government ignoring the wants and needs of New Zealand communities, National Police Spokesperson Tony Ryall said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has ignored the thousands of New Zealanders wanting tougher action on crime throughout the past couple of months, and is turning its back on them again by closing police stations.</p>
<p>&quot;The people of Glenfield have recently had to deal with a tavern shooting and they are very concerned about serious crime. Removing a police presence in the area takes away their security.</p>
<p>&quot;Local MP Ann Hartley must answer why she is breaking her promise that she would keep the police station open.</p>
<p>&quot;National revealed in January the Government&#39;s plans to change the police station network throughout the country. Glenfield may be just the beginning of a domino effect to close police centres.</p>
<p>&quot;I have tried to obtain the Pan Auckland Property Report on police property but the Government has refused to release it under the Official Information Act.</p>
<p>&quot;I have to ask what they have to hide as this points to more police station closures to cut costs.</p>
<p>&quot;I support the Glenfield Community Board&#39;s rally to save their station. George Hawkins must front up as to why he is closing police stations when New Zealanders need police back up,&quot; Mr Ryall said.</p>
