<p>Living Costs Component Will Continue To Rise</p>
<p>New research by the Lincoln University Students&#39; Association shows that the living costs component of the student loan scheme will continue to rise proportionally quicker than the total loan scheme over the next five years.</p>
<p>“This highlights the need for a Universal Student Allowance to be instated,” said Association President Greg Henderson.</p>
<p>“Any coalition that is formed for the next government must have student allowances at the top of the agenda,” said Henderson.</p>
<p>“If Universal Allowances for students is not prioritised then students will continue to borrow money in order to live, this is not only unsustainable, but it is inequitable as well,” said Henderson.</p>
<p>“When students are the only sector in society that have to borrow in order to live, then there is something really wrong with preaching about a knowledge economy,” said Henderson.</p>
<p>“We are not asking for much when looking at a comparison of other government allocations, we are just looking for a fair chance to complete our studies to the best of our abilities” said Henderson.</p>
