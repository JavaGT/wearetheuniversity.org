<p>Awatere Huata Seeks Urgent Debate On NCEA</p>
<p>Tuesday 27 Aug 2002</p>
<p>ACT Education Spokesman Donna Awatere Huata has sought an urgent parliamentary debate from the Speaker to address the Government&#39;s NCEA plans.</p>
<p>&quot;Under standing orders, I have approached the Speaker to seek an urgent debate. This critical issue demands the attention of the entire House.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister of Education announced on Friday that while Level Two of the NCEA would be &quot;available&quot; next year, this did not necessarily mean that all schools have to offer it or that all students have to do it.</p>
<p>&quot;The Education Minister is creating a two-tiered examination system - one which does not address the concerns of parents or teachers.</p>
<p>The Minister believes: &quot;most employers and unversities would only care about Level Three results. Very few people will look at level two.&quot; Then why is he persisting with the introduction of level two of NCEA at all?</p>
<p>&quot;The fairest option would be to scrap NCEA entirely. Mr Mallard&#39;s cowardly gesture demonstrates that even he has no faith in this qualification. He is too scared to dump it or introduce it completely. I hope that parliament will be able to urgently debate this bad decision - parents and children deserve it,&quot; Mrs Awatere Huata said.</p>
