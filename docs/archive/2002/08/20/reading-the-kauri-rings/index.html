<p>Reading The Kauri Rings</p>
<p>Kauri trees and even the kauri clock in your kitchen may help unravel the secrets of El Nino weather conditions, according to researchers at The University of Auckland.</p>
<p>Dr Anthony Fowler, a senior geography lecturer in the Faculty of Science, says his research team has begun a three-year research project studying kauri trees and climate change.</p>
<p>A research team led by Professor Paul Williams at The University of Auckland was recently awarded a $1.6 million Foundation for Research, Science and Technology grant to study climate change. The kauri trees research is an integral part of the larger project.</p>
<p>Dr Fowler, a climatologist and principal investigator on the project, says not enough is known worldwide about El Nino weather patterns - despite the fact it has global implications.</p>
<p>&quot;In the late 20th Century El Nino were unusual as they were more frequent and intense. We don&#39;t know whether this was because of climate change or just natural variability.</p>
<p>&quot;El Nino isn&#39;t something that only happens in New Zealand, as North America and the Tropics are also affected. But we don&#39;t know how long the El Nino has been around and whether conditions are becoming more severe,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Tree rings are a prime method for assessing climate change and Dr Fowler believes kauri trees could be particularly helpful at uncovering El Nino&#39;s secrets.</p>
<p>&quot;We completed a project recently that showed kauri trees respond unusually to climate. Whereas most trees like warm moist conditions, Kauri&#39;s actually prefer the conditions you get in an El Nino - cool and dry.</p>

<p>&quot;That discovery was a big surprise and opened up an opportunity, because we realised Kauri could give us more extensive information about El Nino conditions,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Living kauri will supply the researchers with a history dating back 1000 years, while sub-fossil material such as tree stumps and museum artefacts from the old logging days will provide the researchers with a history hopefully dating back about 4000 years.</p>
<p>&quot;A potential source for this information will come with the help of people who are using kauri stumps to make commercial products such as clocks. These could well be critical materials.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Fowler says researchers would be able to supply commercial operations with details on the age of the trees, and receive samples in return.</p>
<p>&quot;Working with tree rings is a bit like working with fingerprints. You see a pattern in the rings and can cross date. So we might find an old log that we don&#39;t know the age of, but by looking at the pattern of the rings we can work it out.</p>
<p>&quot;If you have a significant climate event such as an El Nino, then all the trees will have the same pattern,&quot; Dr Fowler says.</p>
<p>Using these resources, the researchers will examine kauri tree rings from trees growing between Hamilton and Northland.</p>
<p>The researchers will take a small core sample from the live trees and use a microscope to look at the rings. They are then able to learn what effect climate conditions had on the trees, and how often such climate events took place.</p>
<p>&quot;We know the El Nino has been around for quite some time. But I believe that over the last few decades we&#39;ve had more intense El Nino&#39;s and they become more frequent.</p>
<p>&quot;The records currently only go back to the 1800s but we hope our research will enable us to get more historical detail and hopefully achieve a better understanding of natural climate.</p>
<p>&quot;This will give us a better basis for recognising if and when climate change caused by human activity exceeds the bounds of natural variability. Whether that has happened yet is a hotly contested topic,&quot; Dr Fowler says.</p>
