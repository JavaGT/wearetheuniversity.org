<p>Greens offer cooperation, but not confidence</p>
<p>The Green Party today proposed an amendment to the no confidence motion in the Labour-Progressive Government, based on the failure of the Speech from the Throne to address fundamental concerns about the direction of social, environmental and economic policy.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government&#39;s determination to ignore the wishes of the majority of New Zealanders and lift the moratorium on commercial release of GE made our decision to withhold confidence inevitable,&quot; Co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said.</p>
<p>&quot;The recently-signed cooperation agreement gives us the opportunity to work with the Government on some specific policy areas where we have common ground and can advance the Green agenda.&quot;</p>
<p>However, the Speech from the Throne also failed to assure the party that sufficient progress would be made in addressing issues of social justice and sovereignty.</p>
<p>&quot;Issues that the Green Party has campaigned strongly on - child poverty, a universal student allowance, drug law reform, four weeks annual leave, safe food - are ignored or rejected,&quot; said Jeanette Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>&quot;There is little sign now of the reformist agenda that we applauded three years ago. With this programme, the Government appears to have substituted management for vision.</p>
<p>&quot;However, there is no question of us not working with the Government to try and progress our policies.</p>
<p>&quot;In a true MMP environment, which we are beginning to see in this parliament, parties should vote for good legislation wherever it comes from, and reject the bad. Despite our differences with the Government we can, and will, work to improve the lot of all New Zealanders.&quot;</p>
