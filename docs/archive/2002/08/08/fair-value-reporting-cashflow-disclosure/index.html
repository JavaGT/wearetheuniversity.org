<p>Fair-Value Reporting And The Benefits Of Cashflow Disclosure</p>
<p>The growing popularity of fair-value reporting, compared with historic-cost reporting, highlights the benefits of providing separate cashflow information, a joint study between The University of Auckland and Lincoln University has found.</p>
<p>The study’s findings were based on the 1999 financial accounts of 160 defined-benefit pension schemes, which are required to report their earnings, assets and liabilities on a fair-value basis as well as presenting cashflow statements.</p>
<p>As such, these schemes present distinctive financial reports compared with other entities, which predominantly report on a historic-cost basis.</p>
<p>The study found that the schemes had negative correlations between their earnings (surpluses) and operating cashflows.</p>
<p>In jurisdictions that allow asset revaluations for manufacturing entities — such as New Zealand, Australia and the UK — any unrealized gains or losses on revaluations are not included in earnings.</p>
<p>However, earnings of defined-benefit pension schemes comprise cash and unrealized changes in values of assets and liabilities.</p>
<p>This suggests that unrealised changes from asset valuations are negatively correlated with cashflows from operations i.e. the lower the cashflows the higher the unrealised change.</p>
<p>Thus, cashflows provide additional information to earnings. However, it could also be argued that if unrealised valuation changes are separately disclosed, there may not be a need to report cashflow statements for such entities.</p>
