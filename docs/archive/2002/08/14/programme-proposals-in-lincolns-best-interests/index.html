<p><strong>Wednesday, 14 August 2002, 11:55 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>Chancellor confident programme proposals are in Lincoln’s best interests</p>
<p>Confidence in the management and processes of Lincoln University has been expressed by Chancellor Margaret Austin following today’s meeting (13.8) of the Council at which proposed course adjustments and academic staff cuts were discussed.</p>
<p>“It is regretted that these proposals have to be made but they are in the long term interests of the University,” she says.</p>
<p>Mrs Austin says the proposed adjustments - announced to staff last week - are “relatively minor and based on significant analysis of programmes, subjects and staffing during 2002.”</p>
<p>She stresses that horticulture is not being abandoned - it will be taught through the BSc degree with a new stream in Plant and Horticultural Sciences - a valuation and property management presence will remain through Lincoln’s Master of Property Studies degree and teaching into the Bachelor of Commerce (Agriculture) degree, and while Lincoln’s contribution to the specific Natural Resources Engineering degree will be withdrawn, Natural Resources Engineering will still have a presence on campus through research and teaching into other degrees.</p>
<p>“The proposed adjustments follow more than a year of consideration and analysis and are made in the best interests of the University fulfilling its on-going role as a major national and international teaching and research institution.”</p>
<p>“I reiterate my confidence and that of Council in the management and processes adopted by the University.”</p>
