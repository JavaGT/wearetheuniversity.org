<p>University of Auckland Associate Professor Appointed to Prestigious Music Board</p>
<p>An Associate Professor at The University of Auckland has been voted onto the board of the prestigious International Federation of Choral Music at the Sixth World Choral Symposium in Minneapolis, USA.</p>
<p>Dr Karen Grylls, head of the University’s School of Music, was invited to join the International Board of Directors on August 7 2002.</p>
<p>This is the first time a New Zealander has been elected to the board.</p>
<p>The invitation took place when Dr Grylls attended the sixth world symposium, held from August 3 – 10, to present a session on New Zealand choral music.</p>
<p>She represented the cultural mix of New Zealand’s rich choral music practice including repertoire from Pacific and European traditions.</p>
<p>”It was a fantastic platform to showcase NZ music,” she said. “No choral event in the world is more impressive.”</p>
<p>During the 2002 Symposium&#39;s eight days, delegates from more than 50 countries studied a wide range of choral topics, heard over 40 choirs, and took part in lectures, rehearsals and concerts with outstanding composers, scholars and performers.</p>
<p>This appointment to the board is an important opportunity for the artistic face of New Zealand to be visible on the international platform. As a board member she will represent countries from the Pacific region.</p>
<p>Professor Doug Sutton, Dean of the Faculty of Arts, says Dr Grylls’ world-class reputation is honoured by this appointment, and is a reflection of the high quality academic staff at the University.</p>

<p>“The University benefits immensely from having Karen Grylls as part of the academic staff,” says Professor Sutton.</p>
<p>“Not only is she head of the School of Music, but she has a huge international reputation. She leads the two University Choirs, conducts University and civic concerts and is the artistic director of Tower Voices New Zealand and the Tower NZ Youth choir.”</p>
<p>The International Federation for Choral Music (IFCM) was founded in 1982 for the purpose of facilitating communication and exchange between choral musicians throughout the world.</p>
