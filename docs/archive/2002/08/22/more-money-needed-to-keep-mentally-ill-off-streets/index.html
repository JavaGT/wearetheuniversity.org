<p>More Money Needed To Keep Mentally Ill Off Streets</p>
<p>22nd August 2002</p>
<p>The Government urgently needs to put more money into providing mental health housing, Green MP Sue Bradford said today, after a new report showed thousands of mentally ill face life on the streets.</p>
<p>The Green Spokesperson on Mental Health said that resources for community agencies which provide accommodation also need to be boosted immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;This report from the Social Development Ministry confirms that homelessness, transience, discrimination and substandard accommodation are part of everyday life for people with mental illness.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time to change that. People with or recovering from mental illness don&#39;t deserve to be dumped in the gutter.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Bradford said the Residential Tenancies Bill should be given priority on the legislative programme so that people living in boarding houses receive better protection.</p>
<p>&quot;The report also noted that many mentally ill people are in debt to the Department of Work and Income.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s because it&#39;s very very difficult to cope financially on an invalids or a sickness benefit, even without the added pressure of a mental illness.</p>
<p>&quot;Restoring invalids and sickness benefits to their pre-1991 equivalent levels and requiring DWI staff to provide beneficiaries with their maximum entitlements from the time they register with the Department would be a major step forward.&quot;</p>
