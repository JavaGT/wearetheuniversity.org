<p>Do less in NCEA, Government tells students</p>
<p>The Education Minister is advising secondary students not to do a full complement of five subjects in NCEA in a letter sent to parents and caregivers today, says National&#39;s Education spokesperson, Nick Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;The letter is an outrage. Students are effectively being told not to do the full complement of five subjects in the NCEA because the Government can&#39;t get its act together to make the assessment system work properly.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government should be fixing the qualifications system rather than telling students and parents not to try and complete a full course.</p>
<p>&quot;The NCEA is turning into an education disaster that will dumb down secondary schools. Every student should be able to study five subjects and be assessed in five subjects.</p>
<p>&quot;This extraordinary letter advising fewer students to attempt NCEA Levels 1 and 2 and for students to do fewer subjects is an admittance of failure.</p>
<p>&quot;The letter shows just how serious the problems with NCEA have become. The NZQA has publicly stated they don&#39;t have the money to make it work. 75% of teachers want Level 2 postponed. It is time for the Minister to listen before he makes as big a mess of school qualifications, as he made of teachers&#39; pay,&quot; says Dr Smith.</p>
