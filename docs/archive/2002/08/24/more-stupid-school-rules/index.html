<p>More stupid school rules</p>
<p>Green Youth Affairs Spokesperson Nandor Tanczos today said he was struck by the sheer stupidity of a ban on eating in public for students at Macleans College.</p>
<p>&quot;How petty is it to ban students from eating and drinking on the way to and from school?&quot; said Nandor.</p>
<p>&quot;The school needs to think about what it is there for, to provide students with a decent education or enforce a bunch of silly rules that serve no purpose?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Many people are becoming concerned at the mindlessness of many school rules. Where will it end?&quot;</p>
<p>Nandor said the principal of Macleans should be more worried about whether students were coming to school at all rather than them catching breakfast on the go.</p>
<p>&quot;No wonder there is a high truancy rate in some schools if this is what students have to put up with.&quot;</p>
