<p>New appointments in The University of Auckland’s Department of Political Studies</p>
<p>Over the last few months The University of Auckland has been expanding its expertise in the field of political studies. Six new appointments have been made at the Department of Political Studies.</p>
<p>Dr Jim Headley</p>
<p>Dr Headley has taken up a teaching post at the Department of Political Studies in Russian politics and foreign policy, and ethnic conflict and international security, after recently completing a PhD at the University of London. One of the attractions of The University of Auckland for Dr Headley was that it offers courses on these issues, which directly match his research interests. A book on ‘Russia and the Conflicts in the former Yugoslavia’, written by Dr Headley, will be published in 2003.<br>Contact: Dr Jim Headley<br>09 373 7599 ext 7199<br><a href="mailto:j.headley@auckland.ac.nz">j.headley@auckland.ac.nz</a></p>
<p>Dr Geoffrey Kemp</p>
<p>Having recently completed a PhD at the University of Cambridge, Dr Kemp has moved to New Zealand with his wife and five children to take up a position teaching courses in politics and the media. A former newspaper journalist, Dr Kemp studied ideas of press freedom at Cambridge.</p>
<p>While in New Zealand, Dr Kemp plans to develop his research on the history of ideas of press freedom and the political impact of media change. A related new interest is New Zealand’s own ‘media revolution’ – the historical introduction of writing and print, with the Treaty of Waitangi an early outcome of the encounter of oral and ‘media’ cultures.<br>Contact: Dr Geoffrey Kemp<br>09 373 7599 ext 8093<br><a href="mailto:g.kemp@auckland.ac.nz">g.kemp@auckland.ac.nz</a></p>

<p>Associate-Professor Michael Mintrom</p>

His research covers policy innovation and the ways in which people influence policy, particularly in the field of education. While his work has been grounded in a North American context, he intends to expand it to a broader debate on public policy, including cases in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Professor Mintrom has a new book in production with Georgetown University Press, ‘People Skills for Policy Analysts’. He was recently named President-Elect of the Public Policy section of the American Political Science Association.
