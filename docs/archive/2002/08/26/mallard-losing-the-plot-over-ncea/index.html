<p>Mallard Losing The Plot Over NCEA</p>
<p>The Education Minister&#39;s about-face on Level 2 of the NCEA is a huge blow to teachers and students still struggling to come to grips with Level 1 of the new qualification, says National Leader Bill English.</p>
<p>Trevor Mallard has announced that the introduction of Level 2 next year is optional, and that it would be a school by school, or even department by department, decision as to whether to proceed.</p>
<p>&quot;This back down by the Minister is utterly bizarre. Only two weeks ago, he was vigorously defending rolling out Level 2 of the NCEA next year, despite opposition by most secondary teachers, Opposition parties and many parents,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Many schools will struggle to work out how to implement an &#39;optional&#39; Level 2 and I&#39;m not surprised to hear one teacher describe the situation this morning as a &quot;dog&#39;s breakfast&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;57-thousand Year 11 students are already facing the prospect of a botched qualification at year&#39;s end. Trevor Mallard has messed up the one chance these students have at a fifth form qualification, and he&#39;s now trying to pass the buck to schools by claiming Level 2 would be &quot;available&quot; but not compulsory.</p>
<p>&quot;National called on the Government to halt implementation of Level 2 until the problems around Level 1 were sorted. This advice was ignored, and as a result, irreparable damage is being done to secondary education in New Zealand,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
