<p><strong>Thursday, 13 June 2002, 11:53 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>13 June 2002</p>
<p>&quot;The release of the Children&#39;s Agenda shows that Social Services Minister Steve Maharey is guilty of child neglect on a massive scale,&quot; says National&#39;s Social Services spokesman Bob Simcock.</p>
<p>&quot;After three years of talk about his Children&#39;s Agenda all Steve Maharey has delivered is another list of waffle.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Simcock says this is yet another stunning example of the &#39;Maharey Principle&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;We have children being killed by adults who should be caring for them and all he wants to do is increase the opportunity for people to participate in Government decisions.</p>
<p>&quot;Many children are already casualties by the time they enter school and all this Minister wants is to improve local government planning.</p>
<p>&quot;We have thousands of children being physically and sexually abused every year. Children are dying in CYPS care and still the Minister has done nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Simcock says Steve Maharey has made great claims about wanting to end child poverty, but has no idea or credible plan for achieving this.</p>
<p>&quot;Around 30 per cent of families in New Zealand - and therefore 30 per cent of our country&#39;s children - live in poverty today. This is happening right now under Steve Maharey&#39;s watch.</p>
<p>&quot;This Children&#39;s Agenda is a sham. There is no allocation for it in the Budget and it has not even been mentioned in the Prime Minister&#39;s list of priorities for a future Labour Government,&quot; Mr Simcock concluded.</p>
