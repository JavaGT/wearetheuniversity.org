<p>PLAIN ENGLISH - A WEEKLY UPDATE FROM BILL ENGLISH, NATIONAL PARTY LEADER</p>
<p><strong>AN OLD-FASHIONED ELECTION</strong></p>
<p>The election will turn into an old fashioned choice - Labour and Greens on the left and National, with Act as a supporting party, on the centre right. The &#39;phoney war&#39; phase has concentrated on the Greens, but out on the road, the public want to hear about the big issues - education, the economy and law and order.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m getting such a good response to talking about issues that matter to families, and I&#39;ll keep doing it.</p>
<p>My tour has pulled consistently good crowds and very good coverage in provincial media, and on commercial radio.</p>
<p><strong>MMP</strong></p>
<p>Concern about the Greens reflects concerns about MMP. National will rerun the MMP referendum before the 2005 election so voters get the chance to reject or confirm the system. That&#39;s the way to fix MMP.</p>
<p><strong>TACTICAL VOTERS</strong></p>
<p>Some National supporters are polling as supporting Labour, to keep the Greens outs. Labour are now talking about minority government, signalling they realise they can&#39;t make it on their own. So tactical voters have a choice - vote for National for the policies they support, or vote for Labour for the policies they oppose - and why would you want to do that?</p>
<p>Our research confirms a significant proportion of Labour supporters support National&#39;s plans to reduce business taxes for growth, tougher sentences, resolving Treaty claims, and running a modern education system. We just need to persuade them to vote for the policies they support!</p>

<p><strong>TEACHERS&#39; STRIKE</strong></p>
<p>Labour has decided the strike isn&#39;t hurting their polling, so they don&#39;t need to resolve it. This means that 250,000 secondary students face industrial action for the rest of the year. Teachers I&#39;ve talked to have hardened their attitude even further in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>This week I put forward a proposal to settle the dispute. National is willing to put significant money on the table to get flexibility, performance and quality. Teachers need a more professional pay system.</p>
<p><strong>ON THE ROAD</strong></p>
<p>This week I&#39;ve been to the places the national media don&#39;t reach - Ruatoria, Wairoa, Gore, Kaikohe, Invercargill, Gisborne as well as Papakura and Pukekohe. I enjoy the grass-roots campaigns because it&#39;s so immediate and unpredictable. I&#39;ve been meeting the New Zealanders I talk about - too many of them earn between $9-$13 an hour, and some are raising families on it. That&#39;s why we can&#39;t be complacent about the economy. They need vigorous growth, so their incomes can rise. 2.5% growth isn&#39;t enough.</p>
