<p><strong>Friday, 7 June 2002, 10:39 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Govt must not ignore signs of worsening doctor shortage</p>
<p>The Government ignores new signs of a worsening junior doctor shortage at New Zealand&#39;s peril, says the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA) Co-President Charlie Chambers</p>
<p>&quot;New research released today by the Medical Students&#39; Association revealing that nearly two thirds of medical students plan on going overseas is frightening proof that workforce problems related to student debt crisis remain unresolved.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Many regions of New Zealand are crying out for doctors yet our government is driving medical students overseas with a $50 million loan debt hanging around their necks&quot; said Chambers.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour are failing to connect the dots of government policy. High fees plus lack of universal living allowances equals huge student loan debts and workforce shortages in key areas,&quot; said Chambers. &quot;This is not a new problem. Medical students have been telling the government this for some time now, but their warnings are falling on deaf ears&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;NZUSA supports the medical students&#39; call for increased access to allowances and for an increase to the trainee intern grant, &quot; said Chambers. &quot;We expect more from this government and we will continue to demand more throughout the election campaign.&quot;</p>
