<p>Media Release</p>
<p>7 June 2002</p>
<p>Margaret Wilson Fails The Reality Test Yet Again</p>
<p>“The report of the Attorney General, Margaret Wilson released today which says the rights of boy racers and street hoons to continue their reign of terror and criminal behaviour should be preserved, and that they should not have their cars impounded, is just another example of her political correctness having become farcical, said New Zealand First Leader and MP for Tauranga Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Communities throughout the length and breadth of New Zealand have had enough of this politically correct nonsense and will see this latest absurdity, as further evidence, if any were necessary, that Ms Wilson and her hand wringing PC colleagues have lost the plot completely.</p>
<p>“How on earth one can come to the conclusion that such dangerous behaviour, as evidenced in most every city and town in New Zealand on Friday and Saturday nights, is in anyway a right protected by New Zealand’s Bill of Rights is totally beyond me,” said Mr Peters.</p>
<p>“The rights of the law abiding majority in our communities, to go about their lawful business without the danger of being run down by boy racers or drunken youths is of far greater importance to me and those I represent, than the misguided rantings of a lightweight ex university lecturer, more concerned with protecting the rights of criminals than the rest of us,” he said.</p>
<p>“Ms Wilson will receive a salutary lesson in the facts of parliamentary life when she attempts to stand in the way of the impending legislation now before the Parliament, to curb the excesses of street crime,” Mr Peters warned.</p>
<p>“Academic posturing has no place in the real world,” concluded Mr Peters.</p>
