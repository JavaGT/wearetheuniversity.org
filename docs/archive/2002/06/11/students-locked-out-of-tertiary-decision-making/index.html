<p>Government Locks Students Out Of Tertiary Decision Making</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is accusing the government of arrogance in excluding students from its newly announced Tertiary Education Commission.</p>
<p>“With an election less than two months away, we’re surprised that government would demonstrate so clearly their contempt for students, “ said NZUSA Co-President Charlie Chambers. “Every other country with a commission such as this accepts students as experts with detailed knowledge of the issues relevant to the tertiary sector from a stakeholder point of view. Labour are on their own on this internationally.”</p>
<p>NZUSA are also concerned at the blatant attempt to further meld tertiary education with the needs and goals of the business sector, a plan confirmed by the skewed membership of the TEC.</p>
<p>“The government is hell bent on aligning tertiary education with the needs of business and fostering sectors with commercial application. This is clearly reflected by the number of businessmen and managers on the commission,” said Chambers.</p>
<p>”Why not go the whole hog and appoint Doug Graham to the TEC as well, “ said Chambers. “Without students there would be no tertiary education. We call on the government to immediately appoint a student member.”</p>
