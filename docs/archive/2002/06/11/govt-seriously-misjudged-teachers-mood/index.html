Seriously Misjudged Teachers&#39; Mood</h1>
<p><strong>Tuesday, 11 June 2002, 9:40 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>

<p>The resounding rejection of the secondary teachers&#39; pay deal proves how badly the Prime Minister and Education Minister, Trevor Mallard, have blundered on the issue, says National Leader Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark has shown she&#39;s completely out of touch with the mood of teachers and the mood of parents. Trevor Mallard has stumbled his way through 14 months of negotations, and has achieved absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;Speaking as a parent, I know how angry many parents will be today knowing that there will be more industrial action. Parents have been a silent voice on this, but not any more.</p>
<p>&quot;The education and qualifications of around 300,000 students are on the line because of Government incompetence. It is imperative that Trevor Mallard be removed from any job of negotiating a way out of this crisis because his credibility is in tatters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is inspired teachers and enthusiastic students who matter in education. Helen Clark needs to understand this is more important than polls, apologies and overseas trips.</p>
<p>&quot;National believes teachers deserve better pay. We understand we will have to meet the market to recruit and retain good teachers and our education policy will support this.</p>
<p>&quot;We want more flexibility and more local control in education, not the rigid system this Government demands,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
