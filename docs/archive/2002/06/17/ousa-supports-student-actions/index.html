<p><strong>Monday, 17 June 2002, 3:00 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Otago University Students&#39; Association (OUSA) today announced its support for secondary students actions for teacher pay increases.</p>
<p>&quot;It is wonderful to see secondary students taking actions to support their teachers, whether it be direct action or emotional support&quot; said Katie Grace, Education and Welfare Vice-President.</p>
<p>Secondary students last week timed walk outs of their classes, and have been supportive of their teachers actions.</p>
<p>&quot;While we can understand that this is disruptive, it shows that secondary students understand the issues and want to be as supportive of their teachers as possible&quot; Ms Grace said, in response to NZTA calls of the walk outs being &#39;anarchy&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;But we do agree that the government must react, and work towards a solution that is acceptable for PPTA members&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are willing to support these students in their actions, and help them if possible, it is a great chance for secondary students to tell the government what they want.&quot; Ms Grace concluded.</p>
