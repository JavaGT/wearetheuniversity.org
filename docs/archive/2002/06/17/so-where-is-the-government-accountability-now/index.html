<p>ACT Social Services Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman says today&#39;s postponement of a major conference looking at poverty and social disparities bears all the hallmarks of Government intervention and cover-up tactics.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason given for the postponement is that the issues raised at the conference could be overshadowed during an election campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;On the contrary, surely anything that puts this Government&#39;s handling of poverty and social disparities under the spotlight at the moment would be sure to get a great deal of attention.</p>
<p>&quot;You can only conclude that the real reason for the postponement is that this Government and its Social Services Minister don&#39;t want their dismal record in this area held up for public scrutiny.</p>
<p>&quot;As well as the lost opportunity for discussion of these important issues, I also understand that thousands of dollars of taxpayers money will apparently be lost due to the late cancellation of the conference.</p>
<p>&quot;In Opposition Labour promised accountability and an end to a so-called culture of extravagance with taxpayers money. What a difference two-and-a-half years makes,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
