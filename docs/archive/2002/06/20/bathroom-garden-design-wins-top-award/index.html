<p>Bathroom garden design wins top award</p>
<p>University of Auckland architecture student Philip Kwong and graduate Elvon Young are encouraging people to bathe in their garden.</p>
<p>The two young designers have won the Young Designer of the Year award in the New Zealand Kitchen and Bathroom Design Awards for designing a home bathroom with a garden in the centre.</p>
<p>22 year-old Philip and 26-year-old Elvon also picked up the Northern Region Best Virtual Design award for the CD Rom presentation of their kitchen design, and the Northern Region Young Designer award.</p>
<p>Philip says they wanted to design a bathroom that provided rest and respite in a busy urban environment.</p>
<p>&quot;We figured that many people, particularly in the inner city, don&#39;t have the luxury of relaxing in a garden outside. So we&#39;ve brought the garden to them inside their own bathroom!&quot; he says.</p>
<p>The metre-square garden sits at ground level against one of the bathroom walls, which is open to the sky.</p>
<p>Philip says translucent louvers adjacent to the garden and steam from the bath and shower would give the garden an environment in which to flourish.</p>
<p>Elvon says they didn&#39;t expect their design to win three of the awards.</p>
<p>&quot;We set out to have fun, be creative and learn a lot. We didn&#39;t really think about winning at the time, but the awards are a very nice surprise,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Kitchen and Bathroom Awards have been running for about 10 years. They recognise excellence in the design and construction of residential kitchens and bathrooms.</p>

<p>Philip says his education at The University of Auckland was big help in winning the award.</p>
<p>Philip is completing his fifth and final year of a Bachelor of Architecture degree through The University of Auckland. Elvon is currently running his own private architecture practice in Auckland, Studio E7.</p>
<p>&quot;I was able to draw on a lot of the practical skills and academic theory I learned in my degree, which was a huge bonus,&quot; says Elvon.</p>
<p>Senior Architecture Lecturer at The University of Auckland, Dr Koung Nyunt says the award is a credit to Philip and Elvon, and to the University.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re proud of their accomplishment. It shows we are producing students who understand New Zealand architecture and what it takes to design a creative, but useful end product,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>The University of Auckland offers a five-year Bachelor of Architecture degree and a three-year Bachelor of Architecture studies degree.</p>
