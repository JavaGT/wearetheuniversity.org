<p>Alliance Tertiary Education Policy Sets Standard for Other Parties</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is today challenging all other political parties to match the Alliance’s commitment to relieving student debt announced today in their tertiary education policy.</p>
<p>“NZUSA welcomes the Aliance policy that includes universal allowances, no tuition fees and no interest on existing loans. NZUSA has long argued that the best way to solve the student debt crisis is to address the drivers of debt; high fees and lack of allowances. It is now up to other parties to show how they intend to fix the student debt problem,” said NZUSA Co-President Charlie Chambers.</p>
<p>“For too long tertiary education policy has been characterised by an emphasis on private good. The Alliance policy firmly places tertiary education as an investment in New Zealand’s economic and social future. We all benefit from an educated society,” said Chambers.</p>
<p>“All political parties need to make a similar commitment to students. This election is a crossroad for the student loan scheme. If New Zealanders vote for parties that don’t support student debt relief we will face dire economic and social consequences in the future,” said Chambers.</p>
<p>“NZUSA’s message is simple. We will be strongly encouraging students and their families to vote only for parties offering universal allowances and fee reductions,” said Chambers</p>
