<p><strong>Friday, 14 June 2002, 3:01 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>

<p>Employers are being blatantly ripped off by Labour&#39;s ACC levies, says National&#39;s ACC Spokesman Gerry Brownlee.</p>
<p>&quot;Figures released show that ACC has built up a massive reserve fund, yet the Government has ignored advice to lower employer levies.</p>
<p>&quot;This is daylight robbery. ACC themselves have told Minister Lianne Dalziel the levy is too high, but she is happy to continue a totally unnecessary tax grab.</p>
<p>&quot;Workplace accidents have reduced, but employers are not having the savings passed on to them. Employers are missing out on thousands of dollars they could be re-investing in their business.</p>
<p>&quot;Combined with the 40% hike in premiums for self-employed this year, it makes a mockery of the Government&#39;s claims to be business-friendly. Unnecessary costs like these just make it more difficult to take on more staff.</p>
<p>&quot;National will release our ACC policy soon, which will go back to the successful competitive model,&quot; said Mr Brownlee.</p>
