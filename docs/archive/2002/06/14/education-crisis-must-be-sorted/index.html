<p>Hon Bill English National Party Leader</p>
<p>14 June 2002</p>
<p>Education crisis must be sorted</p>
<p>New Zealand is facing an educational crisis with the victims being over a quarter of a million young people, says National Party Leader Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;As a parent I am angry and as political leader I am angry that no leadership has been shown at any stage to try and sort out the teachers industrial action.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark and Trevor Mallard created high expectations among teachers during the last election campaign. Students are being used as pawns while Labour fails to make any headway at all.</p>
<p>&quot;As a young person you only get one chance and I am not surprised that students are now taking the situation into their own hands as their frustration must be enormous.</p>
<p>&quot;The scenes of protesting students at schools nationwide is unprecedented and no wonder they feel let down. Clark and Trevor Mallard have dithered far too long.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour clearly don&#39;t feel the alarm parents feel at the television scenes of students walking out of classrooms.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever Trevor Mallard thinks he wants to do to the PPTA, I say Labour should put the students first,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
