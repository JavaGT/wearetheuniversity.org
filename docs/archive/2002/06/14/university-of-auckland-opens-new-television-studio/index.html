<p><strong>Friday, 14 June 2002, 12:04 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University">Auckland University</a></strong></p>
<p>14 June</p>
<p>On Tuesday (June 11), University of Auckland television student Kylie Brasell-Dellow interviewed TV3 News anchor, Carol Hirschfeld about the craft of the television interview.</p>
<p>Kylie&#39;s interview was part of the first student project to be undertaken in the University&#39;s newly equipped television studio, located in the Kenneth Myers Centre on Shortland Street.</p>
<p>This building housed the studios of Television New Zealand for many years and is now the home of the University&#39;s School of Creative and Performing Arts.</p>
<p>Kylie was one of 24 students who participated in producing a magazine format programme called i/v live that teaches skills in live studio production and the television interview. The programme production was the students&#39; final assessment in the University&#39;s stage-two TV Studio course.</p>
<p>The course is run through the Department of Film, TV and Media Studies as part of their undergraduate studies.</p>
<p>The Department will use the new studio for teaching and assessment but it will be managed by the television unit within the University&#39;s Educational Media Centre.</p>
<p>Richard Smith, TV producer at the Educational Media Centre, says the new studio will give the University of Auckland leading television production technology.</p>
<p>&quot;This development will enhance both television production and teaching at the University,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>The facility was commissioned in time for the start of the Knowledge Breakfast series, which is being broadcast live from the studio on TV1 on Saturday mornings. The programme runs from 25 May to 13 July.</p>

<p>&quot;The upgrading of the studio will ensure that the University of Auckland&#39;s television production facilities remain in line with technology currently used in the New Zealand television industry,&quot; Mr Smith says.</p>
<p>The studio&#39;s primary purpose is to provide production and teaching facilities for the University of Auckland. It will be used extensively for teaching those enrolled in the University&#39;s Department of Film, Television and Media Studies.</p>
<p>Television lecturer, Margaret Henley says students will benefit from the new equipment.</p>
<p>&quot;Students will be learning to produce television using the same technology they will be using in the workplace, which is huge advantage,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&quot;The new studio and edit suites will enable them to develop skills in studio production, camera-work, on-air presentation and digital editing, within the one centre.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Henley says the facilities will be used for teaching television production papers in the Bachelor of Arts and Masters of Creative and Performing Arts degrees.</p>
<p>&quot;In the undergraduate degree as part of their assessment, film students are able to produce simulated live television interviews in the studio, filming and editing simultaneously.</p>
<p>This can be a stressful exercise, but gives the students great experience of what it&#39;s like to produce live television.&quot;</p>
<p>A paper in television drama production is also offered to undergraduate students wishing to include more practical papers within their academic qualifications.</p>
<p>The production studio contains three cameras, a professional lighting rig and a tele-prompt system. Ms Henley says it is ideal for filming panel discussions, interviews or small-scale drama as well as providing a quality venue for master classes in production for graduate students.</p>
<p>The adjacent control room contains a full range of editing equipment including digital graphics and effects to add visual enhancements to any programme.</p>
