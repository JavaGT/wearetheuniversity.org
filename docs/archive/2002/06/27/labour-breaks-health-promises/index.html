<p><strong>Thursday, 27 June 2002, 1:58 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Thursday 27 Jun 2002</p>
<p>&quot;The Labour Governments promise that hospital services would not be cut is as hollow as their promise that surgery waiting lists would be slashed,&quot; says ACT New Zealand&#39;s Deputy Leader and Health Spokesman Ken Shirley.</p>
<p>&quot;In reality waiting lists are as long as ever and growing and the Government has simply disguised the statistics by creating the new categories of `Active Review&#39; and `GP care&#39;.</p>
<p>Under these categories patients are still waiting for an operation but are unscheduled and they do not appear on the list.</p>
<p>&quot;The promise that hospital services would not be cut has also been broken and the crisis facing Kaitaia Hospital is the first of many. The DHB&#39;s debt loading means they have no option but to cut services and rural communities will suffer the most.</p>
<p>&quot;The suspension of 24-hour surgery at Kaitaia was the first step and now the demise of obstetrics following the banning of caesarean operations will further downgrade Kaitaia&#39;s services.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear that the recently introduced credentialing system is being used by the Government as the excuse for the withdrawal of services.</p>
<p>&quot;The irony is that credentialing is promoted as a clinical safety issue and somehow the Government wants us to believe that no services in remoter communities is safer than existing services that have safely met the community&#39;s needs over many decades.</p>
<p>&quot;The Northland DHB has revealed that their deficit has blown out for the 2001/2002 year from $400 thousand to $6 million - a 15 fold increase&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Worse, the Board is forecasting deficits of $9.8 million , $6.7 million and $4.1 million over the next three years.</p>
<p>&quot;This will cause a further blowout to the debt of the Northland DHB which stood at $7 million as at June 2001.</p>
<p>&quot;Collectively, the 21 DHBs around the country have debt loadings of $900 million, $327 million higher than when Labour took office,&quot; concluded Mr Shirley.</p>
