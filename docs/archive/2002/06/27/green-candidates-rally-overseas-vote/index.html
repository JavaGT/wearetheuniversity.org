<p><strong>Thursday, 27 June 2002, 12:05 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Green Party is looking to boost its number of overseas special votes by selecting two list candidates based in Sydney and London.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1999, we got 5.68% of the overseas specials,&quot; Co-leader Rod Donald said today. &quot;That was higher than our New Zealand-based vote and we know there is huge Green support amongst young, disenchanted kiwis living overseas.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of them have been forced to leave New Zealand under the burden of compounding student debt. Others have had to go overseas to appreciate the clean, green environment they left behind. We will be taking the message to them that only a Green party vote will preserve their heritage.</p>
<p>&quot;We are delighted to have Jo Francis campaigning in Sydney and Christiaan Briggs in London. Both have strong campaign teams of kiwis behind them and also have the support of the Green parties of their host nations. It gives us a terrific advantage to be part of the global Green movement.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whether you choose to vote or not your decision will affect you, especially if you intend moving back home at some point,&quot; Christiaan Briggs is reminding ex-pat voters. &quot;Of course, it will also affect everyone you know in New Zealand, present and future.&quot;</p>
<p>The Green campaign team in the UK plan to attend a number of Kiwi events in the coming weeks, including the New Zealand Food and Wine Festival and the big music festival, The Return of Aot(ear)oa in London, on July 4.</p>
<p>Jo Francis will kick-off the Australian campaign with a launch in Sydney next Thursday, July 4, with the help of young Green Senator, Kerry Nettle, and New South Wales Green MP, Lee Rhiannon.</p>
<p>&quot;The Australian Greens have enjoyed phenomenal success in recent years,&quot; Jo Francis said, &quot;and they&#39;ve volunteered their experience and enthusiasm to help get the Green message out to all the New Zealanders living in Australia.&quot;</p>
