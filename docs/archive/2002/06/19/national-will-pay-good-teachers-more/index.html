<p><strong>Wednesday, 19 June 2002, 10:46 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>

<p>The Government is making no progress on the secondary teachers&#39; pay dispute, particularly since Helen Clark announced last week there would be no more money available, says National Leader Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;Speaking as a parent, this is unacceptable. I see the devastating impact on-going industrial action is having on the confidence, and potentially the qualifications of secondary school students.</p>
<p>&quot;National wants to raise standards in education. There is a better way through this dispute and National will provide it.</p>
<p>&quot;The first task is to get teachers and students back into the classrooms so that the remainder of the school year can be completed without disruption.</p>
<p>&quot;National proposes to make an offer of the order of our settlement in 1999 and a $2000 allowance for the implementation of the NCEA this year, conditional on teachers ceasing all industrial action.</p>
<p>&quot;We would halt Labour&#39;s plans to give kindergarten teachers parity with secondary teachers from 1 July. Labour&#39;s step would make the secondary education crisis impossible to resolve. Kindergarten teachers deserve consideration on their own merit.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking ahead, National proposes to deal with, rather than ignore, the fundamental issues around teacher performance, recruitment and retention.</p>
<p>&quot;We would be willing to continue to fund increases of the order of the 1999 settlement, but would include a strong emphasis on performance and flexibility for schools to reward hardworking teachers through the units currently built into the award.</p>

<p>&quot;There can be no knowledge economy if schools aren&#39;t functioning and students can&#39;t get qualifications. New Zealand won&#39;t succeed in the arts, music or sporting areas without vibrant programmes in our schools. These programmes are at risk.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s alternative is fair to teachers and to taxpayers, and provides a framework for a more constructive schooling environment in the future,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
