<p>Fine Arts Jewellery Student Scoops Prestigious Dowse Award</p>
<p>An Auckland jewellery student has won a prestigious national art award, the Friends of the Dowse Student Design / Craft Award for 2002.</p>
<p>Shelley Norton, a student studying a Bachelor of Visual Arts at The University of Auckland at Manukau, out-designed thirty art students from all around the country to scoop the award, worth $1500. It is the first time that a student from the University has won this award.</p>
<p>It will be presented at a special dinner ceremony on Thursday June 6, when Friends of the Dowse will be celebrating their 30-year anniversary. Shelley will be flown down from Auckland to receive the award.</p>
<p>“I have always been involved in arts and crafts. My mother, who trained as an art teacher, taught me a lot of craft techniques and encouraged me to be creative from an early age,” says Shelley.</p>
<p>“I grew up in Southland where my parents ran a brick and field tile business that was established over 100 years ago by my great grandfather, so I was used to experimenting with a wide variety of materials.”</p>
<p>Shelley has been a physiotherapist for a number of years and says she is enjoying immersing herself in a visual arts degree.</p>
<p>“To win such an award is a great honour,” she says. “The University has been superb – the lecturers have been extremely generous and supportive of my studies.”</p>
<p>Originally offered once every two years, last year the Friends of the Dowse decided to offer the Student’s Design/ Craft Award annually, to encourage students in this field. Dowse Programmes Developer Claire Regnault says Shelley’s entry was outstanding.</p>

<p>“All the judges were unanimous in their decision – Shelly’s work is very well resolved and demonstrated a maturity in conceptual thought and adept use of materials, as well as being delightfully whimsical. We are thrilled that Shelley has won this award.”</p>
<p>The Dowse Art Museum, at 45 Laings Road, Lower Hutt, is highly regarded both nationally and internationally as New Zealand&#39;s principal venue for the exhibition and collection of contemporary New Zealand craft and design.</p>
