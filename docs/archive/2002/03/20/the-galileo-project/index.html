<p>The Galileo Project Background</p>
<p>The Galileo Project is a programme of arts events presented by The University of Auckland, celebrating the life and work of the great Renaissance scientist, mathematician and astronomer Galileo Galilei. The centrepiece of the project is the opera Galileo, which will be performed at the Maidment Theatre from April 10 to 13.</p>
<p>Galileo is a multimedia production, tracing the life of Galileo as he challenged current thinking about astronomy and the physical universe. Galileo utilises modern audio-visual technology, as well as theatre and song to create a total experience for the audience of Galileo the man, and the magnitude of his work for succeeding generations. Using DVD film-work and electronic sound engineering, the opera seeks to appeal not only to opera-lovers, but also a younger generation who now benefit from Galileo’s discoveries. It is the first opera in New Zealand to be performed to such technical specifications.</p>
<p>The opera depicts Galileo’s contention with the accepted view of the laws of physics and the natural cosmos, in particular his observation that the earth revolved around the sun, not vice versa. This discovery led him into conflict with the Catholic Church, which, along with the rest of the world, believed the opposite. Galileo, a devout Catholic himself, set out to prove that a healthy marriage between science and religion was possible – “I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use”. Unfortunately, his position was not quickly accepted.</p>
<p>Music for Galileo was written by John Rimmer, recently retired Professor of Music at The University of Auckland. John has enjoyed a distinguished career as one of New Zealand’s foremost composers and is currently composer in residence of the Auckland Philharmonia. The libretto for Galileo was written by Witi Ihimaera, Associate Professor of English at The University of Auckland, and well-known New Zealand author.</p>
<p>Director of Galileo is John Davies who was Assistant Director of Opera New Zealand’s “Madame Butterfly” and “Manon”. University of Auckland Associate Professor Uwe Grodd will conduct the orchestra, comprised of University of Auckland School of Music students, staff, and members of the Auckland Philharmonia. The Set Designer is Lizz Santos, who is directing set design and costume for Canterbury Opera’s forthcoming production of Bellini’s “Norma”.</p>
<p>The part of Galileo will be played by top New Zealand baritone David Griffiths. Among the main cast are well-known soloists Jack Bourke, Shaun Dixon and Glenese Blake. Other parts will be played by music students at The University of Auckland and associated players with the Auckland Philharmonia.</p>
<p>Tickets for Galileo cost $45, or $35 for a group of 10 or more. Seniors and students with ID are $25. Tickets can be purchased through the Maidment Theatre Box Office or<br>telephone 09 308-2383.</p>
<p>Alongside the opera Galileo, The University of Auckland will run a number of parallel public events celebrating Galileo’s life and work.</p>
<p>A public lecture on the making of Galileo will be presented by John Rimmer, Witi Ihimaera and John Davies on Tuesday March 26th at 7pm – 8pm in the School of Music. This is run through continuing Education. For more information call 09 3737599 ext 7831/7832. They will discuss the making of this contemporary, multi-media opera and explore the issues it intends to raise and address. This seminar will be a valuable pre-runner to the production itself.</p>
<p>The University of Auckland English Department will also run a free public seminar on Thursday 4 April: Galileo - The Man Who Changed The World? This seminar will explore Galileo’s impact on how the world views the heavens, religion and society. The panel includes Associate-Professor Peter Wills (Physics), Associate-Professor Ruth Barton (History),<br>Associate-Professor Ken Larsen (English), Dr. Franco Manai (Italian), Dr. Berndette Luciano (Italian) and Mr. Garry Tee (Mathematics). Admission is free and the seminar will be held in the English Department, Room 426, Arts 1 Building, 14a Symonds St from 5.30pm - 7.30pm.</p>
<p>On April 20, the Auckland Museum Institute presents The World’s First Physicist, a hands-on experience of the instruments used by the famous scientist, for young and old alike. Presented by Geoff Austin, Professor of Physics at The University of Auckland, the public workshop will involve the making and measuring of some of Galileo’s unique instruments, including the Telescope. The workshop will run from 3:00-4:00pm and admission is free.</p>
