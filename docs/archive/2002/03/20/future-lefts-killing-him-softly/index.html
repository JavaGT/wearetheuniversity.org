<p>:: Editorial – Killing him softly ::</p>
<p>He looked, white faced, around the room. His gaze to left and right was met with stony indifference. He noted almost casually that his forehead was drenched with sweat, which was trickling down into his eyes. He could hardly believe what was happening.</p>
<p>&quot;OK, so what the hell would you do?&quot; he asked the assembled members.</p>
<p>&quot;I did what you said. You, Murray, and others, came to me. You said &#39;we have the numbers, you have to stand&#39; and I bloody well did.&quot;</p>
<p>There was no reaction – it was as if he hadn&#39;t spoken. He sighed.</p>
<p>&quot;I bloody well did. Every one of you knows there had to be a change, but it had to be after the election, not before! You all knew how reluctant I was to do it now. All of you know I wanted to wait, but you were too damn impatient, and look where it’s got us.&quot;</p>
<p>At that, some of the faces in the room twitched. Murray stared at him, contempt written across his face. &quot;Yeah, you wanted to wait to protect your own career. You were more concerned with your own future than the rest of ours.&quot;</p>
<p>Slapped with that, Bill eased back in his chair, sighed again, and continued.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to wait because I wasn’t ready. I think events since have more than borne that contention out, don’t you? I just wasn’t ready.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Either you weren’t ready, or you’re just hopeless,&quot; came the fruity voice of the past, standing now with her brooch flashing in the caucus room lights. &quot;I knew you were hopeless, but the rest of you went and did your stupid little coup. Serves you right.&quot;</p>
<p>Mutters of &quot;Shut up&quot; and worse floated around the caucus room.</p>
<p>He tried again, cleared his throat.</p>
<p>&quot;New National was the only way to go. Is it my fault Clark has not put a foot wrong? Is it my fault that she has the media eating out of her hands so much I can’t get a word in edgeways? Is it really all my fault? I don&#39;t see you blaming me for having us at 5% higher than what we got at the 99 election...&quot;</p>
<p>There was dead silence in the room. He looked up at the dust glinting in the sunlight streaming in the window to the left. He thought about the cameras outside, Mark Sainsbury, Jane Young, the others, waiting to see what new plan he had for this week, what issue he was going to try and hit the Government with.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;d offer to resign, but I don&#39;t see any of you wanting this job.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wimp&quot; was the only comment, from the back of the caucus – he couldn&#39;t see who it was.</p>
<p>&quot;Get out,&quot; he said tiredly. &quot;This is going nowhere. Just piss off the lot of you. Caucus is finished.&quot;</p>
<p>He buried his face in his hands, and wondered what the hell he was supposed to do, as the faded suits and lined faces of the National Caucus filed out, putting on the false smiles and simulated banter to keep up appearances as they filed past the cameras.</p>
<p>Murray bent down beside him. &quot;Six weeks mate, or we&quot;ll bring her back. Six weeks.&quot;</p>

<p>:: Tony Milne Selected for Rakaia ::</p>
<p>Last night, Monday 18 March, local resident Tony Milne was selected as Labour&#39;s candidate for the Rakaia electorate. Tony Milne, who lives in Lincoln and has been active in the Labour Party for 4 years, will take on a yet to be selected National Candidate.</p>
<p>&quot;Tony Milne received unanimous backing from the local party organisation last night,&quot; the campaign manager, Barbara Saxelby said. &quot;Labour has spotted Tony as a future leader, and his selection in Rakaia is the opportunity to let his talent shine. We are thrilled at Tony&#39;s nomination, and are confident the electorate will recognise his obvious skills&quot;.</p>
<p>He is currently a final year English and Political Science student.</p>
<p>&quot;My selection consolidates the work I have been doing locally and in Christchurch and gives me the challenge of a lifetime. I am committed to offering Rakaia a serious alternative candidate. I&#39;ll fight for Rakaia and will listen and work with local residents&quot;, Tony Milne said.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to take constituent representation back to basics. I aim to be an effective advocate for local residents by listening to the concerns of local people, and turning those concerns into action&quot;, Tony Milne said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Labour/Alliance government has been very good news for the Rakaia electorate. The local economy has never been so strong. Unemployment is the lowest for 15 years. Labour has focussed on delivering policies and promises&quot;, Tony Milne said.</p>
<p>A Rakaia Labour MP would give local people a direct voice into government. Nothing could be better for the electorate, to ensure that the second-term Labour-led government delivers for Rakaia&quot;, Tony Milne said.</p>
<p>:: News Round up ::</p>
<p>Act during its recent conference said it can get 20 seats in the next election. Future Lefts feels the only way this could be achieved is if the number of list MPs in the house was severely increased.</p>
<p>Michelle Boag has started to follow through with her promise to rid national of the old guard, with Brian Neeson the most recent casualty being deselected for Helensville. This means that since Boag started out on this endeavour Kidd, Shipley, Luxton and now Neeson have all gone. Labour aims to further assist Boag’s cull by making sure even more Nats don&#39;t make it back into the house.</p>
<p>Recently Act and National have been making noises about New Zealand abandoning its Nuclear Free stance so that we can once again be best buddies with America. Future Lefts are appalled by this prospect and are glad to see the PM take such a firm position against it.</p>
<p>Democracy recently has taken a blow at home and abroad. Robert Mugabe was sworn in this week for another 6 year term as President of Zimbabwe after winning elections that Commonwealth observers described as neither free nor fair. This is of grave concern as a move away from democracy will negatively impact on neighbouring countries. It may also jeopardise the New Africa Plan for Development, so strongly promoted as a roadmap to growth for the continent.</p>
<p>Auckland City Mayor John Banks also moved away from democracy by not allowing the public to speak and for no apparent reason arresting peaceful protestors at last Wednesday’s City Council meeting. This appalling treatment of due process and democracy by John Banks resulted in the walk out of Labour, City Vision and Team Auckland councillors. The proposed sale of pensioner housing, use of chemical weed spraying and a raft of other decisions were past at this stage.</p>
<p>:: National Changes Emblem ::</p>
<p>National announced today that it is changing its emblem to a condom because it more clearly reflects the party’s political stance: A condom stands up to inflation, halts production, destroys the next generation, protects a bunch of pricks, and gives you a sense of security while it&#39;s actually screwing you.</p>
