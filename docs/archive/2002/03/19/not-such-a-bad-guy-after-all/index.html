<p><strong>Tuesday, 19 March 2002, 2:07 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association">Victoria University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Media Release – Graeme Edgeler Treasurer - Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA)</p>
<p>A general meeting of Victoria University students voted last week to rescind a position of no confidence they have held in Vice-Chancellor Stuart McCutcheon for more than 18 months. The original motion was approved in August 2000, when McCutcheon was on a shortlist for the University’s top job, and though approved before he was even appointed it has hung over the sometimes tense relationship between senior management and the Students’ Association (VUWSA).</p>
<p>“This is a victory for common sense,” said VUWSA Treasurer Graeme Edgeler, who moved the motion, “removing the binding stance of “no confidence” in the Vice-Chancellor from the books is a tangible step we can take to move forward. For far too long now Students’ Associations have laboured under an impression that it is ‘them versus us’ – this vote indicates that many students feel this assumption must change. We will achieve so much more working with the University, rather than against it.”</p>
<p>“Previously, even when the VC did something we agreed with we basically had to act as though he was a prat. He isn’t. He never has been. The VC may not do everything we would like, and we hold markedly different positions on many issues, but we have never expected him to be a VUWSA lackey. Stuart has steered Victoria University through some very tough times – a substantial budget deficit and chronic government under-funding foremost. Though there is much work needed, this motion is a small gesture of appreciation for the good work so far done, and recognises the improvements made while he has been at the helm.”</p>
<p>“Victoria University is a world-class institution and this new spirit of cooperation is fantastic news for all students. We look forward a future working with Professor McCutcheon, and the rest of University management,” Graeme Edgeler concluded, “and from that students at Victoria University can only benefit.”</p>
