<p><strong>Wednesday, 27 March 2002, 10:20 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>27 March 2002</p>
<p>National MP Murray McCully has called for Teachers&#39; Council chair, Kathleen Irwin, to be stood aside pending the State Services Commission inquiry announced today.</p>
<p>Mr McCully said he was pleased that the Minister of Education will establish a formal inquiry following questions raised during the General Debate in Parliament this afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard has described the new Teachers&#39; Council as &quot;the flagship for ethics and standards in education&quot;. Clearly the Minister now acknowledges that serious questions need to be answered given the statement by Victoria University that they had no knowledge of Ms Irwin&#39;s contractual relationship with the Christchurch College of Education, whilst she was a fulltime employee of Victoria.</p>
<p>&quot;Questions also need to be answered as to why Ms Irwin was the shareholder/director of a company called He Parekereke Limited at the same time that she was director of He Parekereke (the Institute for Research and Development in Maori Education),&quot; said Mr McCully.</p>
