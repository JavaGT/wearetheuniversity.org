<p><strong>Wednesday, 6 March 2002, 11:20 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark&#39;s silly comments about Air New Zealand and Ansett Australia have - yet again - shown her complete lack of business acumen,&quot; says National&#39;s Finance spokesman David Carter.</p>
<p>Mr Carter says the Prime Minister&#39;s ill-informed remarks in Australia about Ansett&#39;s demise shows that she just can&#39;t help herself - despite her evident deficiency in understanding how business works.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year, Ms Clark&#39;s loose lips during the collapse of Ansett and the public revelation of Air New Zealand&#39;s financial perils led to Air New Zealand&#39;s shares being suspended from trading and earning her a stern rebuke from the Securities Commission.</p>
<p>&quot;Now Helen Clark - whose entire business know-how consists of reading about it at either university or Parliament - has run off at the mouth in the Australian media arrogantly apportioning where the blame should lie for Air New Zealand&#39;s decline and Ansett&#39;s ill-fated downfall.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Carter says it&#39;s time the Prime Minister and her Government learnt that the best thing they can do is let business get on with the job.</p>
<p>&quot;Ms Clark and her colleagues should be concentrating on lowering tax, reducing regulatory costs and fixing the mounting problems in the public education and health sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead, it excels in making silly comments, holding pointless, taxpayer-funded talkfests on what Government thinks business should be doing and renationalising assets which most astute commentators find questionable,&quot; Mr Carter concluded.</p>
