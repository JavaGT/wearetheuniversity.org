<p><strong>Wednesday, 6 March 2002, 10:59 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>News that 1800 asylum seekers who&#39;ve been refused refugee status are still living in New Zealand, shows this government&#39;s refugee policies are not working, ACT leader Richard Prebble says.</p>
<p>&quot;In Australia, would-be asylum-seekers are held in detention camps until their applications are processed. But in New Zealand, asylum-seekers are free to come and go as they please, with no incentive to speed up their application.</p>
<p>&quot;By the time their application is turned down, officials don&#39;t even have their address. We are, as the Australian Immigration Minister has repeatedly warned, a soft target.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s no good Phil Goff issuing statements about 20 years jail for people-smugglers, when it clearly pays for people to enter New Zealand illegally.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s also disturbing that despite the amnesty for overstayers, there are now more than 14,000 of them. I note this anti-business government blames employers. It&#39;s not employers&#39; job to run the immigration service.</p>
<p>&quot;Questions have to be asked about how the overstayers got a visa to come to New Zealand in the first place.</p>
<p>&quot;This isn&#39;t a minor matter. In Auckland this year, some 2000 secondary pupils arrived at school to find no teacher because the government hadn&#39;t prepared for the huge influx of migrants. And now we learn a significant number of these migrants are here illegally.</p>
<p>&quot;Two thousand pupils whose education is suffering, is a huge price to pay for this government&#39;s poor administration of the immigration portfolio.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time the government stopped being politically correct and put the needs of New Zealanders first,&quot; Mr Prebble said.</p>
