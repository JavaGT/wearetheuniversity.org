<p>Government announced today that the hotly contested funding for Centres of Research Excellence will lead to the establishment of The MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology at Victoria University of Wellington.<br>The announcement has been made while Nobel Laureate, Professor Alan MacDiarmid, is in New Zealand for his investiture to the Order of New Zealand [Friday 9 March 2002].<br>Victoria University of Wellington had four of its five applications for funding recommended in the shortlist of 16 proposals. “That we have been one of the final five confirms our research reputation,” said Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stuart McCutcheon. “However the fact that we are also a significant partner in two other successful bids is irrefutable evidence of Victoria University of Wellington’s comprehensive research excellence.”<br>Professor McCutcheon noted that the winning proposals showed that Victoria’s success had been achieved despite the fact that it was one of the smaller universities. “What counts is quality, and collaboration. It is critical that research is not conducted in silos, but engages the best minds from a range of institutions.”<br>Professor Peter Englert, Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Science at Victoria University said that The MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology reflects Victoria University of Wellington’s tradition of high quality physical sciences.<br>“It is notable that Victoria University graduates are leading this internationally-recognised research programme. Beginning with Professor Alan MacDiarmid himself, Professor Paul Callaghan FRS and Professor Jeff Tallon FRSNZ, we see New Zealand’s most eminent physicists now combining forces,” he said. “In partnership with Industrial Research Limited, Geological and Nuclear Sciences and the University of Canterbury, this can only be good for the future of physical sciences in New Zealand.”<br>Victoria University would continue to fund the development of other applied research centres through the University’s own resources.</p>
