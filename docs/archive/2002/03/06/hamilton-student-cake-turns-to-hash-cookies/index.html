<p><strong>Wednesday, 6 March 2002, 1:19 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Young_Labour">Young Labour</a></strong></p>
<p>Today Green Party MP Nandor Tanzcos promised students the Green Party would end the student loan scheme and reinstate the Emergency Unemployment Benefit.</p>
<p>“Nandor Tanczos must have been smoking ganja if he thinks the promises the Greens are making at present can be delivered” Waikato Young Labour spokesperson Daniel Rimmer says</p>
<p>“Students have had more out of the Labour Government than any other group other than superannuants since the Labour - Alliance Government came to power in 1999” stated Mr Rimmer</p>
<p>Nationally students have saved $68.5 million last year in student loan interest wipe off alone. While an additional $800 million has been spent on the student loan scheme and student initiatives. These figures include savings of $3.5 m for Waikato University students and $1.8m for Waikato Polytechnic students. Fees have also been frozen for 2001 and 2002.</p>
<p>“Also today Waikato Students’ Union marked that tenth anniversary of the student loans scheme with a birthday cake celebrating the fact that under Labour Student loans are cheaper and are being paid off quicker.</p>
<p>Labour’s election promise of 1999 was to “cut the cost to students of tertiary education, starting with a fairer loans scheme” “Never before have such specific promises been made to students and been delivered by previous National Governments” Daniel Rimmer states.</p>
<p>“Labour was careful at the last election to make specific promises on the interest on student loans and we have delivered on those promises” concludes Mr. Rimmer</p>
<p>Tomorrow at 11.30am Labour MPs Nanaia Mahuta and Dianne Yates will speak on campus during the Orientation festival.</p>
