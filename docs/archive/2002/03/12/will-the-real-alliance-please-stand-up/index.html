<p><strong>Tuesday, 12 March 2002, 9:01 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Young_Nationals">New Zealand Young Nationals</a></strong></p>
<p>University students are confused as to which party is the real Alliance, says Young Nationals Chair Grant Tyrrell, after completing a nationwide tour of six major campuses.</p>
<p>&quot;I was amazed at how quickly the Alliance implosion has filtered down Party ranks. There were no Alliance MPs flying the flag whilst I was on campus. In fact the only Alliance MP I saw was Grant Gillion, but he was promoting the Democrats, who apparently are a political party within the Alliance. He refused to go anywhere near the Alliance table – and I don’t blame him.”</p>
<p>Mr Tyrrell says there is a strong groundswell of support for National, from young people looking for an alternative to the current regime.</p>
<p>&quot;Students were pleased to see National represented on campus and the common message that I received was that they felt let down by the current Labour / Alliance Government. Interest free student loans have caused debt to balloon - nearly doubling since National left office in 1999, with it expected to be close to $6 billion by election time.</p>
<p>&quot;In opposition Labour promised to reinstate the Emergency Unemployment Benefit, but in Government they have done nothing. For many students this benefit allows them to pay the rent as they look for work or get seasonal employment.</p>
<p>&quot;Students want stability, honesty and common sense policies - only a National lead Government can provide this.”</p>
