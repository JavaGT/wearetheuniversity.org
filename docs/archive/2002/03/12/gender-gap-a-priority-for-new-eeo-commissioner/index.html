<p>The growing gender pay gap must be the first priority of the new EEO Commissioner, just as soon as someone is appointed to that position, Green Party Women&#39;s spokesperson Sue Kedgley said today.</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley said the EEO Commissioner should immediately conduct pay audits and research into why the pay gap between men and women continues to widen.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m shocked that new census data released today reveals that women languish more than $10,000 behind men,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Late last year the Green Party convinced the Government to include pay equity in the functions of the EEO Commissioner, a position established by the Human Rights Amendment Bill.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the first jobs of the new Commissioner must be to find out why the situation for women is getting worse, and put forward some strategies to improve it.</p>
<p>&quot;For years women have been told that higher education would increase their earnings and narrow the pay equity gap. However recent research demonstrates that this is wishful thinking - in fact more educated a woman is, the bigger the pay gap.</p>
<p>&quot;A significant proportion of the gap is nothing other than structural discrimination,&quot; said Ms Kedgley.</p>
