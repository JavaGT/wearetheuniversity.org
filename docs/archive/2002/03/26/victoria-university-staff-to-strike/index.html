<p><a href="http://www.aus.ac.nz"><img src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE">26 March 2002<br>Media Release<br>Attention: Education Reporters</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.aus.ac.nz"><br>VICTORIA UNIVERSITY STAFF TO STRIKE</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.aus.ac.nz"><br>After a delayed reply to a staff letter which attempted to settle current employment agreement negotiations, Victoria University has made it clear that it is not interested in settling its employment dispute in the near future. Staff will, therefore, go on strike from 1pm this Wednesday (27th March) until 1pm Thursday (28th March) to seek an improved offer.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.aus.ac.nz">&quot;Staff proposed a compromise which would settle negotiations&quot; AUS General Staff Branch President Tony Quinn stated. &quot;Members had committed to settling with the university for a lower salary increase in order to demonstrate a desire to conclude negotiations. The university&#39;s refusal to accept the counter-offer from staff clearly indicates it is not interested in resolving outstanding matters.&quot;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.aus.ac.nz">The letter, from Association of University Staff and Public Service Association staff, asked the university to withdraw a late claim to alter the term of the employment agreement, which was made after the unions called off a planned strike for 4 March.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.aus.ac.nz">&quot;We believe that this proposed term will disadvantage us in our future negotiations. Members have made it very clear to us that they want this claim withdrawn,&quot; said Christine McCarthy, AUS Academic Branch President. &quot;Now staff will strike and are no longer willing to compromise their position.&quot;</a></p>

<p>AUS Branch Presidents, Tony Quinn and Christine McCarthy, say staff are disappointed that the university has refused the counter-offer in its entirety. “They cannot comprehend the actions of the Vice-Chancellor – this unwillingness to resolve negotiations leaves staff with no option but to take industrial action.”</p>
