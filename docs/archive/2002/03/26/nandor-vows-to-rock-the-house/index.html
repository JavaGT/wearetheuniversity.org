<p><strong>Tuesday, 26 March 2002, 4:08 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Green MP Nandor Tanczos has promised an unorthodox campaign this year when he contests the Auckland Central seat. Nandor has been selected unanimously to stand for the Green Party in the Auckland Central electorate.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a high level of support in Auckland Central last election,&quot; said Nandor. &quot; We will do even better this time.&quot;</p>
<p>In the 1999 election, 3057 people voted for Nandor and 4235 gave their party vote to the Greens. At 12.88 per cent this was the highest party vote delivered to the Greens in any electorate.</p>
<p>&quot;Auckland Central is a young electorate. You have to be creative to be noticed. Last election we campaigned in ways that the grey parties still don&#39;t even know about. This year we&#39;re going to rock the house.</p>
<p>&quot;Students will be a big target, with the universities in the area. Small business owners also respond to the Green message of supporting the local economy, and I understand their issues as a small business owner myself. GE is a major concern for most people. So it&#39;s not just the young who will be voting Green.</p>
<p>&quot;Aucklanders are kicking themselves for allowing John Banks to be elected mayor,&quot; said Nandor. &quot;I think many people will be wanting to make up for it by supporting genuinely progressive and forward thinking policies when they vote this year.&quot;</p>
