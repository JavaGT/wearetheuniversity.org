<p><strong>Tuesday, 26 March 2002, 9:28 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Students at Victoria University are filling out forms requesting their fees back from University Management for classes called off because of the staff strike scheduled to take place from Wednesday 27th March.</p>
<p>‘Students are aware that the University will not being paying staff when they are on strike and believe that it is only fair that the savings are passed on to them’ said Victoria University Students’ Association President Fleur Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>‘Students suffer when Universities cannot attract and retain high quality international academic staff because of uncompetitive salaries and the request for fees back is a recognition of this fact’ said Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>‘The request for a refund shows is a clear message to government that students, like staff cannot afford to bear the brunt of the current under funding of tertiary education and that some urgent action is required to remedy the situation’ said Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>‘The government have done numerous reviews of the situation in tertiary education, it is now obvious that all the fancy lingo and glossy documents need to be coupled with a real commitment to the future of tertiary education, a commitment that can only be met with increased funding for institutions’ concluded Fitzsimons.</p>
