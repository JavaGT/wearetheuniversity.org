<p><strong>Tuesday, 26 March 2002, 2:09 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Association_of_University_Staff">Association of University Staff</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE"><br>Members of the Association of University Staff (AUS) and other campus-based unions are continuing industrial action throughout New Zealand this week. The action arises because salary offers made by university vice-chancellors have been both inadequate and have failed to take account of recruitment and retention, and workload issues.</p>
<p>At Victoria, where members will commence a 24-hour strike at 1 p.m. tomorrow, the action also focuses on issues relating to the term of the collective agreement.</p>
<p>While the Victoria strike is under way, staff at Waikato, Massey and Lincoln Universities will undertake other forms of action.</p>
<p>Members at Waikato, where negotiations are currently under way, will attend stop-work meetings tomorrow to receive a progress report on negotiations and consider recommendations from the Campus Action Committee.</p>
<p>Massey University has been involved in mediated negotiations with the Association and members are meeting tomorrow to discuss a new employer offer. As a gesture of goodwill before the second day of mediated talks (scheduled for Thursday 28 March), a ballot on further industrial action has been postponed for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Lincoln staff will attend members’ meetings tomorrow at which the Vice-Chancellor, Dr Frank Wood, and Human Resources Manager, Luke Southorn, will endeavour to explain to members why there has been no change in their offer. Members will then determine the AUS response and consider what further action, if any, may be necessary.</p>
