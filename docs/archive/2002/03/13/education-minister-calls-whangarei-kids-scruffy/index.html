<p><strong>Wednesday, 13 March 2002, 1:50 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>“Remarks by the Minister of Education, Trevor Mallard, about the standard of dress of children at Manaia View School are demeaning,” says NZ First MP, Brian Donnelly.</p>
<p>Questioned in the House about a spur-of-the-moment one-off grant of $10,000 to buy student T-shirts, that he had when opening Manaia View School, Mr Mallard said: “When I was there I noted that the kapa haka group had some very nice T-shirts but the rest of the kids looked very poor and pretty scruffy.”</p>
<p>“The Minister’s remarks are patronising and insulting”, said Mr Donnelly. “I certainly didn’t see a scruffy bunch of kids. I thought they were dressed pretty similarly as any group of school children in a Northland school.”</p>
<p>“The parents of Raumanga and associated areas whose children attend the new school should be outraged by these remarks”.</p>
