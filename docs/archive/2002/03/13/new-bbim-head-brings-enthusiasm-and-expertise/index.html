<p>New BBIM Head Brings Enthusiasm And Expertise To The Position</p>
<p>The University of Auckland Business School&#39;s new Director of the Bachelor of Business and Information Management Degree, Dr Douglas Carrie, hopes to encourage a culture for BBIM staff and students that emphasises innovation, integration, and transparency.</p>
<p>“The BBIM degree was developed in response to a growing demand for graduates who can combine both business and information management skills. It was also specifically designed for students who wish to study accounting, human resource management or marketing combined with information management,” Dr Carrie says.</p>
<p>&quot;This degree programme aims to break down traditional boundaries between departments and disciplines and is being developed and delivered by diverse groups of people across multiple campuses. In designing and rolling out this degree, we are in fact practicing the types of innovative and integrative thinking that we are trying to encourage in our business students.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Carrie, BCom, MIM, PhD, replaces Dr Alan Teixeira, who will now focus on his teaching commitments after playing a key role in establishing and directing the new degree programme.</p>
<p>A senior lecturer in marketing, Dr Carrie joined The University of Auckland in 1995 and received a Distinguished Teaching Award in 1998.</p>
<p>Dean of the Business School Professor Barry Spicer says Dr Carrie has been an enthusiastic supporter of the BBIM from its inception and he has made a significant contribution to the design and development of the degree.</p>

<p>Dr Carrie gained his PhD in marketing from London Business School in 1997. He has been a visiting lecturer at the London School of Economics and a visiting professor at the Thunderbird Graduate School of International Management in Arizona.</p>
<p>As well as a successful academic career, Dr Carrie has had commercial business experience as a sales manager, business development manager, and media consultant.</p>
<p>“I am passionate about teaching and course design, and seize any opportunity to apply my entrepreneurial instincts in marketing a high quality product or service,” says Dr Carrie.</p>
<p>“I look forward to the chance of managing and working with my Business School colleagues to continue to develop and deliver a truly world-class business degree programme.”</p>
<p>As Director of the BBIM, Dr Carrie will continue to teach various marketing courses on the BBIM.<br>He will be based on the University’s Tamaki Campus, but will retain an office in the Marketing Department on the City Campus in order to lead and co-ordinate the programme, which is offered on three campuses – Tamaki, North Shore, and Manukau.</p>
<p>Offered by The University of Auckland Business School for the first time in 2001, the BBIM was the first degree in New Zealand to offer a fully integrated education in both information management and business disciplines.</p>
<p>Like the Bachelor of Commerce, which is taught at the City Campus, the BBIM provides a solid foundation in business, including economics and commercial law.</p>
<p>The difference between the degrees is that the BBIM has a more interactive teaching and learning style with a greater emphasis on the use of business case studies and simulations to provide students with an applied experience.</p>
<p>The three-year programme follows a pyramid structure, with a core of business and information management courses in the first year which are closely integrated. In the second and third years of the programme students study Information Management with a specialisation in a second major in accounting or marketing.</p>
