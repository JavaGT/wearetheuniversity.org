<p><strong>Wednesday, 13 March 2002, 9:35 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>12 March 2002</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s turning a blind eye to justice in small towns with its push to close or downgrade 13 courthouses around the country, says National&#39;s Associate Regional Development spokesman, Shane Ardern.</p>
<p>&quot;The anger and disbelief of many small communities has been highlighted by the presentation of a 9000-signature petition to Parliament today, calling for the Rangiora courthouse to be kept open.</p>
<p>&quot;Regional Development Minister, Jim Anderton, travels the country trumpeting the regional development cause, but he&#39;s unfazed that axing courthouse services will deny nearly a quarter of a million New Zealanders reasonable access to justice.</p>
<p>&quot;The community consultation process is a sham. Meetings organised by the Corrections Department have been poorly advertised and interested groups have been left out. The Government&#39;s just hellbent on ramming these changes through.</p>
<p>&quot;Even the proposed cost savings are a farce. I&#39;ve been told that downgrading courthouses to hearing centres will save around $30-40 thousand per centre. But this will quickly disappear as police, JP&#39;s and corrections staff rack up travel and other related costs associated with not having a local courthouse in the town,&quot; says Mr Ardern.</p>
