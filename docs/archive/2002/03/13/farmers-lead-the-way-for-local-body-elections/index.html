<p><strong>Wednesday, 13 March 2002, 3:24 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Fonterra&#39;s decision to adopt the Single Transferable Voting system for Board and Council elections has been welcomed by Green Party Electoral Reform spokesperson, Rod Donald.</p>
<p>&quot;We congratulate Fonterra for adopting STV,&quot; said Rod Donald. &quot;I&#39;m delighted that New Zealand&#39;s largest company recognises that STV is a &#39;fairer and more effective system&#39; for electing its Board and Shareholders&#39; Council.</p>
<p>&quot;STV is as easy as 1-2-3 and is the best system for making sure that shareholders&#39; votes count, and are not wasted.</p>
<p>&quot;The new system will ensure that the three successful Board candidates will have achieved at least 75% support from shareholders - and that is a far more satisfying result for electors and elected alike.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m now very optimistic that District Councils will change to STV for the 2004 local body elections, following the participation of thousands of farmers up and down the country in this process.</p>
<p>&quot;I had been expecting metropolitan councils to lead the way in picking up STV as their voting system of choice but hats off to the rural sector for again leading the way.&quot;</p>
