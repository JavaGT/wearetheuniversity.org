<p><strong>Friday, 15 March 2002, 11:25 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Green Youth Affairs Spokesperson Nandor Tanczos today said Fielding High School Principal Roger Menzies should focus on providing education rather than stamping out self expression among students.</p>
<p>&quot;Students are being suspended from schools on ridiculous grounds, such as having piercings, showing a bit of skin or having interesting hair,&quot; said Nandor.</p>
<p>&quot;The expulsion of 16 year old Fielding student, Josie Mallinder, on Wednesday night for refusing to be forced to take out her tongue piercing is the latest example. This is Victorian nonsense. What business does the school have being fashion police?</p>
<p>&quot;Personally I don&#39;t like piercings, but who cares? Will a pierced tongue impair anybodies learning? No, but expulsion certainly will.</p>
<p>&quot;What this is really about is punishing Josie for daring to challenge pointless rules. It is a power trip.&quot;</p>
<p>Nandor said he agreed with the Children&#39;s Commissioner Roger McClay that there needed to be an independent agency for young people to challenge expulsions.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the 21st Century. Schools should be encouraging creativity, self expression and critical thinking. We are constantly being told to challenge the boundaries and innovate, yet some schools still seem preoccupied with churning out proles who will do what they are told. School is not a sausage factory.&quot;</p>
<p>Nandor said it was a completely arbitrary judgement for schools to allow piercings in some parts of the body but not others.</p>
<p>&quot;Fielding could take a leaf out of the book of Onslow College in Johnsonville which is relaxed about teenagers self expression and is serious about supporting diversity and providing decent education for all its students.&quot;</p>
