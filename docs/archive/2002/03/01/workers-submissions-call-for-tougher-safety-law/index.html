<p>Thousands Of Workers’ Submissions Call For Tougher Safety Law</p>
<p>Between 5,000 and 6,000 workers have made written submissions calling for tougher health and safety law said Council of Trade unions president Ross Wilson today.</p>
<p>The submissions will be delivered to Parliament at lunchtime tomorrow, where they will be accepted by Labour MPs Mark Gosche and Rick Barker.</p>
<p>“This is the strongest stand taken over workplace law since workers supported the Employment Relations Act,” said Ross Wilson.</p>
<p>“Submissions are pouring into the CTU office from union members calling for n end to work-related deaths, injuries and accidents.”</p>
<p>The submissions will be delivered to Parliament at 12.15 tomorrow, when workers will also plant 500 white crosses in Parliament grounds.</p>
<p>A similar event will take place at the Parliament Street construction site in Auckland where Terua Tearoa tragically lost his life in January this year.</p>
<p>The Auckland event is also at 12.15 and 500 crosses will also be displayed in memory of the 500 New Zealanders who suffer work-related deaths annually.</p>
