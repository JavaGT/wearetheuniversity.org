<p>Tertiary Strike Direct Result Of Government Promises</p>
<p>The Tertiary Education Minister and his colleagues have very short memories on sorting pay deals for university staff, says National&#39;s Tertiary Education spokesperson Maurice Williamson.</p>
<p>&quot;It was only a short time ago, while in Opposition, that Steve Maharey and other now-Government Ministers were running the line that National was badly underfunding tertiary education and that academic staff were getting a raw deal.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ll fix it - they promised - as they built up a huge level of expectation amongst university staff.</p>
<p>&quot;But the reality is now very different as strikes over &quot;unacceptably low&quot; pay offers go ahead at Canterbury, Waikato and Massey Universities today, and there are no deals signed yet at Victoria and Lincoln.</p>
<p>&quot;I know the sort of expectation Steve Maharey created for these staff so he shouldn&#39;t be surprised to see some of them rejecting offers around two and three percent.</p>
<p>&quot;What will be interesting is how much political support Mr Maharey and his colleagues get from the academic sector at the next election,&quot; says Mr Williamson.</p>
