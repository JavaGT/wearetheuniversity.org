<p><strong>Monday, 4 March 2002, 9:56 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>1 March 2002</p>
<p>Planned strike action by Lincoln University academic staff on Monday 4 March has been called off following negotiations today (1 March) between Association of University Staff (AUS) representatives and the Vice-Chancellor, Dr Frank Wood.</p>
<p>While settlement has yet to be reached, good progress has been made, says the University’s Human Resources Manager, Luke Southorn.</p>
<p>“We are pleased that we have been able to avert compromising our students through strike action by academic staff,” says Vice-Chancellor Dr Frank Wood.</p>
<p>“It is an extremely difficult situation for everyone in a university which prides itself on its strong student culture.</p>
<p>“I am grateful that in spite of the pressure that continuing funding constraints are having on staff at Lincoln, and indeed across the tertiary sector, a sense of goodwill has prevailed.”</p>
<p>Both parties had worked very hard over the past few days to establish a base on which settlement might be reached and negotiations were continuing said the Human Resources Manager.</p>
<p>Both parties acknowledged the extreme difficulties the current situation was creating, he said.</p>
<p>“Clearly the achievement of Government’s stated social and economic goals will only be possible if a longer term solution is given priority at the highest level.”</p>
<p>Lincoln University Students’ Association President Greg Henderson congratulated the University and AUS on the progress they had made.</p>
<p>The President of the Lincoln University branch of AUS, Dr Jim McAloon, stressed that the Government must act urgently to address salaries and resourcing of universities.</p>
<p>“We are all agreed that this matter requires urgent political commitment,” said Dr McAloon.</p>
