<p><strong>Monday, 4 March 2002, 9:39 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>3 March 2002</p>
<p>Helen Clark should step in and resolve immediately the increasing bitter stand off between the Government and teachers, says National Party Leader Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Government was really interested in young people&#39;s education they would never have let it get this bad.</p>
<p>&quot;Teachers through out New Zealand thought this Labour Government would be their friend, now like their health colleagues they are finding out they could not have a worse enemy and that is why they are so bitter.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government is building up an appalling record in the area of public service and the current disruption within education is testament to that.</p>
<p>&quot;It was not that long ago that current Education Minister Trevor Mallard described National&#39;s 1999 settlement of seven and a half per cent over two years as &#39;mean and miserly&#39;, so why is he now surprised at teachers anger at his offer of 3.5% over two years. After 10 months of dithering the Government has created a real mess.</p>
<p>&quot;There can be no doubt that the extra demands placed on teachers by way of the new National Certificate of Educational Achievement weighs heavily on their minds.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government always new there would be an issue over the NCA and should have resolved this a long time ago. Students preparing for this year&#39;s NCA are having to pay dearly for the Governments inaction. These students only get one chance and deserve every chance they can get.</p>
<p>&quot;It is ironic that at a time when this Government is full of talk about a knowledge economy that they are paying no respect at all to those who are best positioned to encourage it.</p>
<p>&quot;We have under a Labour Government good hardworking New Zealanders like health workers and teachers striking which means there must be something going very wrong in the way Labour runs the public service.</p>
<p>&quot;I call on the Prime Minister to step in and sort out this latest debacle and give the teachers the respect she should have shown them a long, long time ago.</p>
