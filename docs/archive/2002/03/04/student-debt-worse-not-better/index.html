<p><strong>Monday, 4 March 2002, 12:53 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Auckland students&#39; total debt is set to double under the Labour/Alliance government, said ACT leader Richard Richard Prebble who is visiting Auckland University today.</p>
<p>&quot;Judith Tizard boats that Auckland students have saved more than$14 million in interest charges off their student loans due to the government&#39;s no interest while studying policy. But the $14 million will be more than wiped out by the fact that students must pay interest on a much larger debt after they graduate.</p>
<p>&quot;So the interest bill for graduates, far from having decreased, will have doubled under this government.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem has never been getting a student loan. If anything, loans have always been too easy to get. The problem is repaying the debt after graduation. That&#39;s got worse and Judith Tizard has no ideas on how to assist graduates in repaying their debt.</p>
<p>&quot;This government is just irresponsibly encouraging students to get further into debt.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT favours tax relief to help students repay their debt - and the best form of tax relief is lower taxes,&quot; Mr Prebble said.</p>
