<p>Grant Tyrrell NZ Young Nationals Chair For Immediate Release</p>
<p>The Young Nationals Annual Conference ended today after three successful days.</p>
<p>“A key theme from conference speakers and delegates was one of sticking to National’s values of freedom, individual responsibility and less government,” Young Nationals Chair Grant Tyrrell said.</p>
<p>“A persistent example throughout conference was the black-hole of any budget - health spending. Flinging money at the problem will be no solution. National’s policy will have to be innovative and address the systematic problems in health.</p>
<p>“A Young Nationals remit passed at conference calls for a National government to concentrate on properly funding health services without being concerned whether providers are public or private.</p>
<p>“Other remits included a policy of ‘throwing away the key’ for New Zealand’s worst criminals. Ending the inequity of the current student allowances policy, based on parental income and to reinstate honours titles.</p>
<p>“Conference condemned the Labour regime for its failure to reinstate the Emergency Unemployment Benefit and noted the irony that unemployed ‘artists’ were eligible to benefits.</p>
<p>“Young Nationals continue to oppose the government in the market place with remits passed to sell both TVNZ and the struggling Kiwibank.</p>
<p>“In keeping with National’s principles a remit was passed to end racial quotas on tertiary level courses. It is a slight to Maori and patently unfair to have such quotas. On one hand it suggests that a section of society is ‘more deserving’ than another and on the other it insults Maori with the suggestion that otherwise they would not be skilled enough to enter the course,” Grant Tyrrell commented.</p>
<p>“Young Nationals are in good heart, with almost 50 delegates from around the country, attending. We are now in full campaign mode and look forward to our next conference when National is in government.”</p>
