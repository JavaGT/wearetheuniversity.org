<p><strong>Wednesday, 30 January 2002, 11:35 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Extra $400 Million Health Spending Will Go On Salaries</p>
<p>The news that Canterbury nurses have called off their strike is welcome but the government must be worried by the Canterbury District Health Board&#39;s statement that it has increased its debt so it can make a more generous pay offer, ACT leader Richard Prebble says.</p>
<p>&quot;The health board&#39;s debt was already $108.9 million, according to the answer to a Parliamentary question by the ACT Party last month.</p>
<p>&quot;The nurses have rejected a 6 percent pay offer so it now appears that an increase of more than 6 percent will flow right through the public health sector. The nurses were seeking 13 percent, so an increase of about 9 percent now seems possible.</p>
<p>&quot;A 9 percent increase across the board in the hospital sector will mean that all the government&#39;s extra $400 million health spending, which doesn&#39;t start until next financial year, will be taken up by salaries.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT has warned the government repeatedly that the Employment Relations Act gives unions in a monopoly health system the power to demand and get away with any pay rise they ask for.</p>
<p>&quot;Previous health rounds have indicated that settlements tend to escalate. For example, young doctors have never settled for the same percentage pay rise as the nurses - they&#39;ve always demanded and got more.</p>
<p>&quot;This isn&#39;t the end of the health dispute, it&#39;s just another day in it,&quot; Mr Prebble said.</p>
