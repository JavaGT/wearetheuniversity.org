<p><strong>Wednesday, 16 January 2002, 10:22 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>15 January 2002</p>
<p>National warned the Government that zoning laws would see parents desperately scrambling to get their children into popular schools, and that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Nick Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a disaster. With Year 9 rolls well up for many schools this year, the schools are having to drop subjects, teach in totally unsuitable areas or boost their class sizes to cope.</p>
<p>&quot;National told the Government that its zoning scheme would put schools in an impossible position. Now we have Auckland Grammar wanting to ditch the scheme and other schools lobbying to limit their rolls.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government&#39;s zoning legislation has been a total failure. Instead of giving individual schools choice in selecting students, it&#39;s marginalised parents who can&#39;t afford to buy or rent in certain areas and has created a band of elitism around particular schools.</p>
<p>&quot;The only winners from this zoning policy have been the real estate agents,&quot; says Dr Smith.</p>
