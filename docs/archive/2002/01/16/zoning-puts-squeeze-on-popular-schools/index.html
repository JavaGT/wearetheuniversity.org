<p><strong>Wednesday, 16 January 2002, 10:14 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Tuesday 15 Jan 2002</p>
<p>The Government has abandoned some of the country&#39;s most popular schools and is leaving them alone to battle the effects of the coalition&#39;s blatantly racist and elitist zoning system.</p>
<p>&quot;It is unacceptable that some of our best schools cannot properly plan classes and timetables, are having to restrict subjects, and are teaching students in substandard facilities.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government should have well known that its zoning system would cause a rush of parents moving into areas with good schools so they can do the best they can for their children in an unfair system.</p>
<p>&quot;Now these popular schools are being forced to cope, without any help from the Government.</p>
<p>&quot;If these schools experience a drop in education standards it will be the Government&#39;s fault. The ridiculous zoning system is actually acting as a disincentive for top schools to maintain their standards. Trevor Mallard must now abandon zoning to give every school and every child a chance,&quot; Donna Awatere Huata said.</p>
