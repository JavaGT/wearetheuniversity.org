<p>ACT Environment Spokesman Gerry Eckhoff said today that the Green Party must now immediately publicly renounce law breaking activity - including destroying GM crops.</p>
<p>&quot;Interviewed on the radio this morning, Green MP, Nandor Tanczos, repeatedly refused to condemn the act of sabotage at Lincoln which caused over $100,000 of damage and put back vital research years.</p>
<p>&quot;The public will look at Mr Tanczos&#39; previous association with the extremist Wild Greens and interpret his comments as meaning that the Green Party clearly supports this kind of activity.</p>
<p>&quot;Back in November I wrote to Greens co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons asking her to make a public commitment that the Green Party does not support the breaking of the law to achieve their aims. Furthermore, I asked for a guarantee that no Green Party facilities in Parliament would be used to further the cause of eco-terrorism. I never heard back from Ms Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>&quot;I call on Ms Fitzsimons to now make clear public statements on both these matters.</p>
<p>&quot;The Green Party demanded the Royal Commission on GM and it was given a privileged position in the hearings. The commission was the most exhaustive review of GM that the world has seen - and yet because the Greens disagree with the findings they appear to support those taking the law into their own hands.</p>
<p>&quot;The Green Party has a choice. Either it supports the law - a process it is involved in as an elected Parliamentary party - or it supports lawlessness. It can&#39;t have a dollar each way. Unless it condemns lawlessness its credibility is shot,&quot; Gerry Eckhoff said.</p>
