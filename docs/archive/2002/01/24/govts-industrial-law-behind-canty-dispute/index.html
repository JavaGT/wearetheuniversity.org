<p>Roger Sowry National Health Spokesperson</p>
<p>24 January 2002</p>
<p>Govt&#39;s industrial law behind Canty dispute</p>
<p>National&#39;s Health spokesperson Roger Sowry has welcomed the Canterbury District Health Board&#39;s decision to proceed with mediation but says it&#39;s time the Prime Minister took action over the crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;Mediation is the only sensible way forward,&quot; Mr Sowry said after attending an emergency meeting in Christchurch called by the board today.</p>
<p>&quot;I am pleased with the line the board is taking given the very difficult circumstances the Government has put the board in. The Canterbury DHB is caught in a pincer between underfunding and bad industrial relations law.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s industrial relations law has prevented the board&#39;s chief executive from communicating directly with staff to explain the offer. The board is an impossible position, made worse because the Minister is sitting on her hands over the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;With the board and doctors saying there will be deaths due to such a long strike this is a very serious crisis. The Prime Minister needs to instruct Annette King to work with both parties to resolve this issue,&quot; Mr Sowry said.</p>
