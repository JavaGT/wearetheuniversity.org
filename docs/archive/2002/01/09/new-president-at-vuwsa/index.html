<p><strong>Wednesday, 9 January 2002, 10:26 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association">Victoria University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Hello, I am Fleur Fitzsimons, the new President at the Victoria University Students’ Association. I am from Hastings and have been studying politics and law at Victoria for the last five years. I have taken over from Chris Hipkins who was the President in 2000 and 2001. I have been a member of the VUWSA executive for the past two years as Education Officer in 2000 and Welfare Vice President in 2001. The new Vice President (Welfare) is Catherine Belfield-Haines and Vice President (Education) Adrianna Withers.</p>
<p>I am really keen to see more student involvement in VUWSA activities and awareness of what the University is doing. With this year being election year I think we have a unique opportunity to see some real improvements in Tertiary Education, I think universal student allowances and lower fees are the least that students can expect.</p>
<p>I am keen to see VUWSA organise weekly vegetable markets in the quad, free neck and shoulder massages in the library during exams, the continuation of the walk home service ‘Campus Angels’, a garage sale in the quad and a welfare and advocacy service run by student volunteers.</p>
<p>I would be happy to speak to you or meet in person to answer any questions or discuss any issues.</p>
