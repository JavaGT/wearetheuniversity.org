<p><strong>Wednesday, 9 January 2002, 12:07 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Postshops and other outlets proposed as Kiwibank franchises are high security risks and potential sitting targets for robberies, warns National&#39;s Associate Finance spokesman David Carter.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of these planned bank franchises are just not suitable or properly equipped for the handling and dispensing of large amounts of money,&quot; Mr Carter says.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot are situated in old buildings that are totally inappropriate for providing the safety and protection people need and expect in today&#39;s banking environment. If you go into any modern bank, it is quite apparent the many thousands of dollars each branch invests in security.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, outlets - without the proper security measures in place - are just sitting ducks for the criminal fraternity.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Carter says he has spoken to staff at a number of Kiwibank franchises and they are very concerned about the lack of security and the risk to their own welfare.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government needs to think seriously about the danger it is putting both staff and potential customers at, in the establishment of this purely politically appeasing and commercially risky banking venture,&quot; Mr Carter concluded.</p>
