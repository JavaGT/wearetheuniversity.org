<p>PRESS RELEASE<br>Announcing the;<br>39th Outdoor Summer Shakespeare</p>
<p>W. Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing Director Colin Mitchell</p>
<p>Directors vision - The Era of Invention.</p>
<p>In this fantasy created under the Auckland University Clocktower, we will see decadence fall into filth and dilapidation, modern technology recreated with steam and clockwork so that ladies in corsets clasp pump-action crossbows, whilst a string group is accompanied by throbbing electronica.</p>
<p>This year&#39;s production of Much Ado About Nothing combines anachronism, decay and invention into a high-energy performance that will remain faithful to Shakespeare&#39;s text while including many contemporary elements to keep the show charged and extremely entertaining.</p>
<p>Rust and frills unite in this production, so that the interaction of the lovers takes place against a backdrop that juxtaposes beauty and industry. As well as a sweet romantic love story, the play also features all the elements of great fairytales; feigned death, dramatic interventions and evil villains.</p>
<p>Much Ado About Nothing - surreal, passionate, dark and beautiful.</p>
<p>Director - Colin Mitchell</p>
<p>Colin has a long history of involvement in theatre and drama at the University of Auckland, recently he directed Stage Two’s (UoA Theatre Club) “Anti Pasto”. His most recent involvement with Outdoor Summer Shakespeare was as an actor in 1999’s Henry V and as Assistant Director in 2000’s as you Like It.</p>
<p>Colin was also recently awarded a University of Auckland Cultural and Arts Blue recognising his theatrical arts achievement both on and off campus.</p>
