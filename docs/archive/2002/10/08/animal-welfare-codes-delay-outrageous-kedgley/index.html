<p>Delay in implementing animal welfare codes outrageous</p>
<p>Green Animal Welfare Spokesperson Sue Kedgley today said she was appalled at the Government&#39;s announcement today of a bill that delays implementation of animal welfare codes by between one and three years.</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s Animal Welfare Amendment Bill delays the implementation of compulsory animal welfare codes for animals like pigs and chickens by one year and for practices like castration and dehorning by another three years.</p>
<p>&quot;I simply do not accept that the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee couldn&#39;t manage to get these codes ready for implementation in the three years they have already had,&quot; said Ms Kedgley.</p>
<p>&quot;This bill brings in significant delays for the long overdue implementation of compulsory animal welfare codes. This Bill is a clear sop to industries which are vigorously resisting the public&#39;s demand for animals - particularly chickens and pigs - to be treated humanely.</p>
<p>&quot;This Bill is seeking to buy the industry time in the hope that the heat will go out of the issue. There is intense public interest in this issue with tens of thousands of submissions opposing the use of battery cages and insisting that animals must be able to display normal patterns of behaviour,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;This Bill is a slap in the face for all of those New Zealanders who have made submissions on these codes, but Government cannot protect these industries forever.</p>
<p>&quot;Sooner or later the Government and industry are going to have to bite the bullet and face the fact that people want change,&quot; said Ms Kedgley.</p>
