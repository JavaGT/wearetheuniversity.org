<p>Media Release</p>
<p>9 October 2002</p>
<p>Urgent Steps Needed To Ease Student Loan Debt</p>
<p>New Zealand First has suggested urgent action to address student loan debt which has exploded to $4.75billion with serious implications for the future.</p>
<p>Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters said New Zealand First would promote a private member’s bill to introduce a universal student allowance and also promote loan abatement schemes.</p>
<p>“We will continue to insist that that the appropriate ministries study the impact of student debt, which will have disastrous economic and social consequences.</p>
<p>“We will continue to force changes to our immigration policies to stop temporary residents ripping off our education system.</p>
<p>“While our finest young people are disappearing overseas to avoid the millstone of their debt, more places are being taken in our professional schools by foreign-born students whose parents use immigration loopholes to take advantage of New Zealand taxpayers.</p>
<p>“They are often on full allowances and have no intention of staying in New Zealand once qualified.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters said it was past time for the Government to give priority to New Zealand youth who are “under-resourced, under-valued, and increasingly over there”.</p>
