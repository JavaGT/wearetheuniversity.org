<p><strong>Wednesday, 9 October 2002, 3:07 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Simon Power</p>
<p>National Tertiary Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>9th October 2002</p>
<p>It&#39;s the Maharey Principle again</p>
<p>The Minister of Tertiary Education Steve Maharey&#39;s spin on student debt totally contradicts what he said while in opposition, says National&#39;s Tertiary Education spokesman Simon Power.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1996 an outraged Mr Maharey put out a press release calling the student loan scheme &quot;an out of control monster&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;He also said that &quot;Students and former students are now in debt to the Government to the tune of $1.6 billion and the Government, in a mix of naivety and stupidity, thinks of that debt as an asset.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This year&#39;s annual report on student debt shows that debt has grown from $2.9 billion to $4.7 billion under his stewardship, and it still refers to debt as an asset.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour also promised to lower fees to $1000 and bring in universal allowances.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that he has been the Minister for three years he has had plenty of time to make changes.</p>
<p>&quot;Or is this another example of the Maharey Principle - just something you say while in opposition?&quot; said Mr Power.</p>
