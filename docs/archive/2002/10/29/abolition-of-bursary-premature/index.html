<p><strong>Tuesday, 29 October 2002, 5:47 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Nick Smith National Education Spokesperson</p>

<p>Abolition of Bursary premature</p>
<p>The decision to abolish Bursary in 2004 and replace it with Level 3 of the NCEA is grossly premature, says National&#39;s Education spokesperson Nick Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is showing reckless disregard for the credibility of our school qualifications system. We have no guarantee that Level 1 NCEA will work and results are not due out until January. A question mark hangs over Level 2 with schools having a choice to proceed or not. To decide now that they are proceeding with Level 3 and to scrap Bursary is irresponsible.</p>
<p>&quot;This decision is a crude attempt to bully schools into doing Level 2 NCEA next year. Schools are left with a &#39;Clayton&#39;s Choice&#39; - if they decide not to proceed with Level 2, their students will be forced to do Level 3 NCEA.</p>
<p>&quot;Bursary has become a very credible academic qualification used by universities for determining entry to many programmes like medicine, engineering and law. It must not be scrapped until there&#39;s considerably more confidence in its replacement,&quot; says Dr Smith.</p>
