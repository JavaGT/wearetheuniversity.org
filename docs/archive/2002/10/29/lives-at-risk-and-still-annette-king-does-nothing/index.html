<p>Patient lives at risk and still Annette King does nothing</p>
<p>The Government is ignoring the plight of critically ill patients being moved around the country because of industrial action at Auckland hospitals, says National Health Spokesperson Dr Lynda Scott.</p>
<p>“These patients lives are being put at risk. Health Minister Annette King is refusing to comment on the strikes, but who takes responsibility if patients come to any harm in this situation? Doctors say there is a significant risk of patient harm and that this serious situation is a disaster for Auckland.</p>
<p>“The public want to know what the Minster will do about preventing this strike continuing and patient safety being put at risk.</p>
<p>“Annette King directed the Auckland District Health Board to live within the 2% cap for wage increases.</p>
<p>“The Government’s mismanagement of health was behind the extended industrial turmoil at Canterbury last summer, now it’s Auckland’s turn. This situation is even more serious. It affects all patients from those who are critically ill to those who have had surgery cancelled.</p>
<p>“Annette King ignored the Canterbury dispute for weeks until it became completely out of hand. This is now happening in Auckland. The Minister can’t simply turn her back on these ongoing problems and the patients that they affect,” said Dr Scott.</p>
