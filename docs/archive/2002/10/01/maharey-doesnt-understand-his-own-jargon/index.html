<p>Maharey Doesn&#39;t Understand His Own Jargon</p>
<p>The Minister of Tertiary Education clearly doesn&#39;t have a clue about links between tertiary education providers and industry, ACT New Zealand&#39;s Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;In a speech delivered December 2001 Hon Steve Maharey said `stronger linkages and networks&#39; between tertiary providers and business were needed,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed, his own Tertiary Education Advisory Committee in its November 2001 report advised that `improved linkages between tertiary providers, industry and the wider community&#39; are needed.</p>
<p>&quot;Then just nine months later in September 2002 the Minister is admitting ignorance,&quot; says Miss Coddington.</p>
<p>&quot;In reply to a written question, Mr Maharey said `The exact nature and extent of links between tertiary education providers and their partners in industry and the wider community are not currently known&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;So are the linkages strong, medium, weak or non-existent?&quot; Miss Coddington asked. &quot;I think we should be told.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is seeking to establish, through the Tertiary Education Reform Bill, a central planning command centre for all tertiary education providers.</p>
<p>&quot;This Tertiary Education Commission will dictate what courses providers will be allowed to offer, depending on their `profiles&#39; which they must submit for approval.</p>
<p>&quot;Why should we accept the Minister&#39;s word that these `profiles&#39; will `ensure links are robust and genuine&#39; when he doesn&#39;t even know how strong or weak the links are now?</p>
<p>&quot;The ACT Party says the best way for tertiary education providers to strengthen their connections with industry is for the Government to get out of the way.&quot;</p>
