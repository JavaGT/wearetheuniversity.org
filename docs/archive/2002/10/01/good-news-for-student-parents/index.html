<p>Good news for student parents</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) has welcomed today’s announcement that students with dependents will be able to access financial assistance this summer as they move from student allowances to other benefits.</p>
<p>“Student parents have to struggle all year to manage study, work and family commitments,” said NZUSA Co-President Charlie Chambers. “We’re pleased that they will no longer have to face a week with no money to feed their families at the end of term time this year.”</p>
<p>“The last budget signalled greater assistance for this growing group of students, and we are pleased that the Government are delivering on these promises this summer.”</p>
<p>Other students however, will still face a one-week standdown period with no income as they make the “transition” from student allowances to other benefits.</p>
<p>“The third of students who are currently eligible for living support during both the academic year and summer are the lucky ones. Now that the government has recognised that a stand down week puts students with dependents in hardship, its time for them to consider how it affects those other students who still have to face a week with no money to pay for food or rent,” said Chambers.</p>
<p>“The Government must use the next budget to increase access to living allowances, and to remove the stand down week for all students. While this is definitely a step in the right direction, for thousands of students it’s just an inexcusable administrative anomaly that sees them stuck with no money at the end of exams.”</p>
