<p>Fee shambles forecast by Treasury</p>
<p>Simon Power - National Tertiary Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>National’s Simon Power is predicting chaos at tertiary institutions next year as they come to grips with a new fee structure that’s been condemned by Treasury .</p>
<p>“It’s now clear our tertiary institutions are to be lumbered with a system that’s complicated, confusing, unjust and simply not workable”</p>
<p>National’s Tertiary Education spokesman has released papers obtained under the Official Information Act showing the Government has ignored the advice of Treasury officials, backing a policy which could end up costing tertiary institutions big money.</p>
<p>“It’s clearly more evidence of a Government that has no idea how to solve the crisis in tertiary education,” says Mr Power.</p>
<p>The papers say that by implementing the fee stabilisation plan, the Government’s consigning tertiary institutions to a framework with no fiscal flexibility.</p>
<p>“We should be letting them get on with the business of teaching and research, not putting barriers in the way by creating more red tape,” says Mr Power.</p>
<p>In return for stabilising fees tertiary education providers will get a 4.5% funding boost, but the papers say no flexibility is being given to those courses facing huge growth or those where costs are likely to increase.</p>
<p>“It’s an ill-conceived policy that needs immediate review, otherwise New Zealand’s young, our future, will pay the price for years to come,” Mr Power says.</p>
