<p>Compulsory WSU Bungles It Again</p>
<p>The bungling of the executive elections by the Waikato Student Union (WSU) is yet another argument against compulsory membership of the association, Student Choice said today.</p>
<p>WSU elections were supposed to run from 1-3 October but have been delayed, and this week the Waikato Times reported that a further postponement is possible due to alleged electioneering rule breaches. In addition WSU has failed to pass the 2003 budget and set its fee for next year.</p>
<p>&quot;The mismanagement of the election and the budget - on top of WSU&#39;s many other problems - has again confirmed that students should not be forced to join this dysfunctional organisation,&quot; Student Choice spokesman Clint Heine said today.</p>
<p>Without the 2003 fee being set the election is a farce. &quot;Candidates will be making promises without knowing how much money WSU will take from students next year.”  </p>
