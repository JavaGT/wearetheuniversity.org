<p>Involve Gisborne and Pukekohe growers</p>
<p>Green Party Co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons is calling on MAF and ERMA to work closely with Gisborne and Pukekohe growers worried about the effects of GE contamination.</p>
<p>MAF and ERMA today said its tests confirmed hybrid maize crops harvested at Pukekohe and Gisborne earlier this year by Pacific Seeds contained GE varieties in low concentrations.</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons said: &quot;It is essential that MAF involve the local growers in the monitoring - in designing the monitoring protocols, sample collection and inspections. Local communities should always be involved in cases like this.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons said it was reassuring the concentrations were low. But the risks of another GE contamination remained too high till New Zealand stopped importing potentially contaminated seed.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand needs to work with companies and countries around the world to establish a trading network for certified GE-free seed,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons said that while MAF and ERMA&#39;s tests suggested the presence of only 800 GE plants last season, they would have borne many thousands of seeds.</p>
<p>&quot;While 800 plants may appear a small number, if each of them bore one cob - with a conservative estimate of 200 seeds on it - that is 160,000 GE maize seeds to plant the next season.</p>
<p>&quot;Had they been planted in New Zealand, they would potentially produce 32 million seeds the following year, and that is a substantial source of contamination for other maize,&quot; she said.</p>
