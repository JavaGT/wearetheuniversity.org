<p>National holds successful Tauranga meeting</p>
<p>Tony Ryall - Bay of Plenty MP Wayne Mapp - National Housing Spokesperson</p>
<p>Close to 80 people attended a public meeting in Tauranga this afternoon organised by National regarding the rotting home crisis. National’s housing spokesperson Wayne Mapp and Bay of Plenty MP Tony Ryall as well as a number of expert speakers attended it.</p>
<p>“There was widespread support from affected homeowners for compulsory arbitration as suggested by National through the proposed Weather Tightness Tribunal, says Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>“Voluntary mediation was seen as a waste of time with one person present noting that he expected to go bankrupt before his builder under the current arrangement.</p>
<p>“Another person present had already spent over ten thousand dollars in legal fee’s trying to sort his rotting house out, says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>This is the fourth public meeting now organised by National for concerned homeowners. Already successful meetings have been held in Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington.</p>
