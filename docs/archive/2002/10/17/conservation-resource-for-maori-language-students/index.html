<p>Young Mâori language students will be able to learn about New Zealand’s iconic native bird the Kiwi in their own language on a new interactive CD-ROM.<br>The CD-ROM, Manu Rongonui, was developed for the Department of Conservation by the Wellington College of Education’s Te Kura Mâori division.<br>Conservation Minister Chris Carter launched the new resource to support conservation education for Maori language learners at Wellington’s Titahi Bay North School today (Thursday October 17).<br>Lynette Bradnam, Co-Director of Te Kura Mâori at the College, said the CD-ROM was a first for both the Department and Te Kura Mâori.<br>“We’re delighted to be involved in this project. We believe it is important for young Mâori language learners to have high-quality resources in Te Reo Mâori. A waiata (song) included on the CD-ROM about the kiwi by DOC manager Dave Para provided inspiration for the content.”<br>Ms Bradnam said the resource was developed after consultation with kaumatua (elders), kura (chiefs) and DOC and the College looked forward to being involved in the development of other resources.<br>The resource is aimed at six to eight year olds and contains curriculum links in English and Maori as well as songs and worksheets. It focuses on the conservation of the kiwi and includes activities on kiwi biology, habitat and threats to the survival of the native flightless bird.<br>Media are invited to attend the launch that begins at 11am on October 17, 2002 with a powhiri, at Titahi Bay North School Hall, 47 Jillett St, Titahi Bay, Porirua.<br>For more information contact:<br>From WCE: Lynette Bradnam, Co-director Te Kura Maori, 04 924 2288 or 029 924 2288<br>From DOC: Kevin Smith, Conservation Adviser, 04 471-9143 or Pam Crisp, 04 471 3116.</p>
