<p>NCEA Inquiry Will Expose Failure</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand, the only political party in parliament that has consistently opposed the National Certificate in Education Achievement, is delighted that the education select committee is conducting an inquiry into the qualification, Education Spokesman Donna Awatere Huata said today.</p>
<p>&quot;I am delighted every political party other than Labour has joined ACT in realising that we must ask serious questions about NCEA. I have heard horror stories from parents, teachers and students. Already, many New Zealanders have already gone to the ACT website and signed Richard Prebble&#39;s petition to scrap this dangerous experiment being conducted on our children.</p>
<p>&quot;If this inquiry into the handling of the NCEA is worth its salt, it will expose failure after failure by Education Minister Trevor Mallard and his team of bureaucrats. It will reveal how worthless and flawed this qualification really is.</p>
<p>&quot;I look forward to being actively involved in this inquiry, because it is what New Zealand families deserve,&quot; Mrs Awatere Huata said.  </p>
