<p><strong>Wednesday, 23 October 2002, 2:34 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>It takes a tragedy to shed light on SAS role</p>
<p>The Green Party has expressed its sorrow over the wounding of three SAS soldiers in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&quot;We extend our sympathies to the wounded servicemen and to their families,&quot; said Keith Locke.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope this sad event will help the government to reconsider whether our troops should remain in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand casualties are now being added to those of many thousands of innocent Afghan civilians in this largely secret war.</p>
<p>&quot;The government should tell us what is really going on.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a very sad irony that it takes an tragedy like this to get any information at all about what our troops are doing in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has steadfastly and unreasonably refused to divulge any information about what the SAS is doing in our name. In fact, U.S. web-sites contain more information about their activities than our Government is willing to trust us with.</p>
<p>&quot;The government also now has to justify why we are endangering SAS soldiers by keeping them in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&quot;The Taliban forces were defeated a long time ago. What Afghanistan needs now is help rebuilding the country and ridding it of those mines that have now cost New Zealanders so dearly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Getting a free-trade agreement with the U.S. is no reason to risk the life and limb of New Zealand soldiers,&quot; said Mr Locke.</p>
