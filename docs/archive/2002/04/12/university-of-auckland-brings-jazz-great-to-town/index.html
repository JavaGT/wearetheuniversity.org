<p>University Of Auckland Brings Jazz Great To Auckland</p>
<p>American jazz piano legend Andy Jaffe is visiting New Zealand this month, giving two public lectures and a concert at The University of Auckland.</p>
<p>Jaffe, who is Artist-in-Residence and Director of Jazz Performance at Williams College in Massachusetts has written over 100 jazz and other compositions and authored one of the most influential text books on jazz theory.</p>
<p>He will be in Auckland for three weeks as Visiting Lecturer in Jazz in the University&#39;s School of Creative and Performing Arts (SCAPA).</p>
<p>During this time he will be working primarily with students in the jazz major of SCAPA&#39;s new Bachelor of Performing Arts degree, offered for the first time this year.</p>
<p>He will also give two public lectures - Duke Ellington: Jazz Composer on Thursday April 18 and John Coltrane: Worlds of Music on Tuesday May 7, and a public concert Sunday May 5.</p>
<p>Head of SCAPA, Alan Smythe says Jaffe&#39;s visit is a great coup for the University.</p>
<p>&quot;We make a big effort to expose our students to the best international academics and performers in creative and performing arts whenever possible.</p>
<p>&quot;Having Andy Jaffe here and working intensively with our jazz students for three weeks is a fantastic opportunity for them. They&#39;ll have a chance to learn from and observe one of today&#39;s most prominent and influential jazz musicians and composers.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s also a great opportunity for the public to hear him lecture on two outstanding jazz figures of the past, of whom he is a scholar, and perform a solo concert, which jazz-fans won&#39;t want to miss,&quot; he says.</p>
