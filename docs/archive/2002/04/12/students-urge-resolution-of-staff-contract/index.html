<p><strong>Friday, 12 April 2002, 9:30 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association">Victoria University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Students at Victoria University are calling on management to get their act together and settle the staff contract negotiations.</p>
<p>‘Students just want to get on with studying in the lead up to examinations in June’, said Victoria University Students’ Association President Fleur Fitzsimons</p>
<p>‘University management need to make sure that students suffer the least interference with their studies by addressing the terms of the staff contract to make the timing of negotiations meaningful for staff’, continued Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>Students at Victoria University requested their fees back for the disruption caused by the staff strike before Easter and would look to do the same in relation to the withholding of examination results.</p>
<p>‘We are still waiting for a response from the University regarding giving students their fees back for the strike before Easter. Students will again request fees back if any similar industrial action is taken’, said Fitzsimons</p>
<p>‘The withholding of examination results can have serious consequences for students especially those looking for work or aiming to graduate, it is important that management do not let it come to that’, said Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>‘Students are looking forward to a mature attitude from management and staff so that a resolution in the best interests of the University can be found’ concluded Fitzsimons.</p>
