<p><strong>Tuesday, 9 April 2002, 2:09 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>9 April 2002</p>
<p>National&#39;s SOE&#39;s spokesman, Murray McCully, has called on Television New Zealand to release immediately the proposed protocols for increased board involvement in programming.</p>
<p>&quot;TVNZ chairman Dr Ross Armstrong has spent many months and tens of thousands of dollars using external legal advisors, including an Oxford University don and a Wellington Queen&#39;s Counsel, to devise protocols for greater board involvement. Those protocols will go to the next TVNZ directors&#39; meeting,&quot; says Mr McCully.</p>
<p>&quot;TVNZ should release the draft material immediately. A proposal for involving politically appointed directors in TVNZ programming, particularly news and current affairs, is a matter of huge public interest. The proposals should be released and debated.</p>
<p>&quot;TVNZ is the state broadcaster, owned by the public. It should not be treated as the political plaything of the chairman and the Minister,&quot; said Mr McCully.</p>
<p>&quot;If they really have nothing to hide, they will release all of the relevant papers today,&quot; says Mr McCully.</p>
