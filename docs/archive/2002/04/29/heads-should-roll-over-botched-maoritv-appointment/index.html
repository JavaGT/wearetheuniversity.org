<p><strong>Monday, 29 April 2002, 6:11 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>

<p>Heads must roll over the botched appointment of the Maori TV service chief executive, says National&#39;s Broadcasting Spokesperson, Katherine Rich. &quot;This board appointed a chief executive to run a Maori TV channel who had never worked in television or been involved in Maoridom, can&#39;t speak the Maori language and didn&#39;t have the qualifications and credentials he claimed too.</p>
<p>&quot;Derek Fox and his board are responsible for this botch up but this Government won&#39;t sack him because he would then pose a threat to them by trying to get his political party off the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;The taxpayer deserves to know exactly what were the &quot;robust and correct&quot; processes used by the Board in appointing John Davy and what the recruitment firm actually did for their $40,000 - $60,000 fee.</p>
<p>&quot;Derek Fox defended this appointment. Common sense would suggest that checking whether or not a University exists would be fundamental. The fact that some Board members had not met the successful candidate or seen his CV before his &quot;unanimous&quot; appointment is sloppy governance at its worst.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a Government and Board blunder so monumental that it&#39;s likely to plague the entire establishment of Maori Television. Helen Clark can blame the recruitment agency but she knows the Board and the Government are responsible for their decisions - that&#39;s what governance is all about. &quot;Derek Fox isn&#39;t paid big directors fees to then blame others when things go wrong. Board chairs and members are paid to carry this sort of responsibility.</p>
<p>&quot;There is more than egg on Government faces here, there is an entire omelette. &quot;If heads don&#39;t roll over this and by heads, I mean the Board and the Chair, New Zealanders will be extremely resentful at more millions being spent on Maori Television - a channel likely to be watched by fewer than 3% of New Zealanders,&quot; said Mrs Rich.</p>
