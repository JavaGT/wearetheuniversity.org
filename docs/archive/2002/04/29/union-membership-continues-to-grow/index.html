<p><strong>Monday, 29 April 2002, 3:55 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions">New Zealand Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p>Today’s announcement that union membership is continuing to rise in New Zealand was welcomed by Council of Trade Unions president Ross Wilson.</p>
<p>The Victoria University annual survey of trade union membership shows the ranks of unions swelled by just under 11,500 in the year to 2001.</p>
<p>“Collective bargaining is on the increase and workers can see clearly the link between union membership and improved wages and conditions,” said Ross Wilson.</p>
<p>“The steady increase in union membership reflects not only the improvements in worker’s rights under the law, but a positive image of unions.”</p>
<p>Ross Wilson said that the CTU was working with unions to boost membership.<br>This included traditional sectors such as construction, but also new occupational<br>groups.</p>
<p>Membership of the CTU has grown significantly from 19 affiliates representing 189,000 in 1999 to 33 affiliates representing around 250,000 workers in 2002.</p>
<p>“The CTU is the largest democratic organisation in New Zealand,’ said Ross Wilson.</p>
<p>“We expect to keep getting larger, as workers continue to see the benefits of union membership.”</p>
