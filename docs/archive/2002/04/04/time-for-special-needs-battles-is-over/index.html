<p>Lianne Dalziel should work with the families of special needs children, not take them back to court, Green Party Disabilities spokesperson Sue Kedgley said today.</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley said the Associate Minister of Education should accept the High Court decision, which found that the shift to main-streaming special needs students was illegal, not appeal it as she threatened to do yesterday.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a criminal case to be appealed on technical details. The 14 families who took this case deserve help not another battle.</p>
<p>&quot;Simply throwing special needs students into main-stream classes does not work - parents know it, teachers know it, the High Court knows it. It&#39;s time the Government knew it too, and did something about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley said the only way mainstreaming could work was if extra resources were targeted to help each special needs student keep up with the class.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government now has to stop bulk-funding schools for special needs students. Schools should be funded for each special needs student they teach, not an average number likely to be enrolled.</p>
<p>&quot;Real life is more complicated - one school might have five, one might have none. Funding should reflect real people and their needs, not some accountant&#39;s ideal world.&quot;</p>
