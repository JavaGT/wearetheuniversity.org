<p>Student Media Set To “Rip Mad Shit Up” In Election Year</p>
<p>New Zealand’s tertiary students will reap the benefits of enhanced election coverage and improved information sharing following a national conference of student newspaper editors in Auckland.</p>
<p>Attendees of the Aoteroa Student Press Association (ASPA) conference included editors from Otago, Victoria, Massey, Waikato, Massey Albany and Auckland University of Technology papers. Among the topics discussed by the journalistic powerhouse were an election year strategy, the adoption of new members, national advertising sales, horny goat weed, and the role of student media.</p>
<p>“ASPA is boss”, said co-President Patrick Crewdson. “We’re ripping mad shit up”, added co-president Toby Morris.</p>
<p>Conference organiser and co-President Nadine Metzger said that the ASPA conference set a brilliant base for the year ahead. “The synergies created by the nine-member body was both innovative and astoundingly immense”.</p>
<p>ASPA anticipates having an international web presence by the year’s end. “Coupled with our newly successful information sharing system, this will represent a significantly improved service for students”, said outgoing co-President Anthony Hiron.</p>
<p>Election coverage will also be improved. “Apparently there will be an election this year”, said co-President Max Rashbrooke. “Our election coverage will be super. Super-bad, I mean.”</p>
<p>It is estimated that between them Critic, Chaff, Debate, Nexus, Salient and Satellite have approximately 115,703 readers. According to Hiron, the student market is worth over $4 billion annually. “We’re up to our elbows in its mad flava”, he said. “We’ve got our fingers on plenty of pulses”.</p>
<p>ASPA and invited guests will meet again later this year for a training conference in a heavily guarded, mystery, South Island location.<br>Boo-ya.</p>
