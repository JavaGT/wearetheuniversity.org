<p>Locke Chosen As Green Candidate For Epsom Electorate</p>
<p>Green MP Keith Locke was last night chosen as the party&#39;s candidate for the Epsom electorate.</p>
<p>&quot;My main aim will be to double the party vote in the seat to 10 percent. This is achievable, as there a lot of Green friendly voters in the seat. In 1990 the Green Party won 13 percent of the vote in Remuera.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Locke has lived in the electorate, in Mt Eden, for the last 15 years.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll be focussing on stopping the Eastern Highway slashing its way through the electorate,&quot; said Mr Locke, who is the party&#39;s Associate Transport Spokesperson.</p>
<p>&quot;We don&#39;t need more motorways pouring more cars into central Auckland. The money available should go to completing the rail network as a top class passenger transport system, and improving bus connections.</p>
<p>&quot;Newmarket station should be humming as a hub for this passenger rail system.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Locke is also against the &quot;huge supermarket&quot; off Broadway being planned by Westfield.</p>
<p>&quot;That would only bring thousands more new cars into an already clogged Newmarket and undermine shopping along Broadway. The Newmarket retail are has great character, which we don&#39;t want to lose.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Locke, who is also the Green Party Foreign Affairs spokesperson, thinks voters will be attracted by the party&#39;s peace message.</p>
<p>&quot;People of Epsom follow world events closely and are proud of New Zealand&#39;s nuclear-free status. Many are not happy that we are tagging along behind America in ventures such as Afghanistan,&quot; he said.</p>
