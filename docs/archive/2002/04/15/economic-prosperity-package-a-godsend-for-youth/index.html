<p><strong>Monday, 15 April 2002, 12:50 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Young_Nationals">New Zealand Young Nationals</a></strong></p>
<p>15 April 2002</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s Economic Prosperity Package announcement is a step forward for New Zealand, and especially for youth,&quot; NZ Young Nationals Chair Grant Tyrrell commented today.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand has been drifting for the last three years with a government unable or unwilling to make strategic decisions. Growth has fallen, tax has risen, essential services are failing to deliver and naturally young people have been leaving the country en masse. Today&#39;s announcement is the first step in reversing this trend.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand is currently on a collision course with the third world. Today&#39;s announcement deals with the issues that have been in the too hard basket for too long. It is only with a growing economy that we can sustain an ageing population, and provide first-class education and health care.</p>
<p>&quot;Lower taxes create growth and at a personal level reward excellence. Young people entering the workforce are being trusted with their money to save, repay debt or spend as appropriate.</p>
<p>&quot;By promoting economic growth National will also be able to respond to the other great issue of my generation - student loans. Young Nationals will continue to work towards equitable student polices.</p>
<p>&quot;The choice is clear. Re-elect mediocrity or vote for prosperity - the difference has never been so stark. Only a National government can deliver,&quot; said Grant Tyrrell.</p>
