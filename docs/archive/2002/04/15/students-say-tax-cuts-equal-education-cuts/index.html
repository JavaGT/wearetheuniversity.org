<p><strong>Monday, 15 April 2002, 3:51 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is calling on Bill English and the National Party to explain how an $815 million decrease in tax revenue in the first year, and $850 million for the next three years, won’t effect their investment in tertiary education.</p>
<p>“The National Party slashed per student funding during their last attempt at government. Average university fees rose by 129% during their nine years of power. National were responsible for $3 billion dollars of student debt and were thrown out of government because of it,” said NZUSA Co-President Andrew Campbell.</p>
<p>“National will only worsen the student loan crisis with their plans to cut taxes. Student debt will be a $20 billion dollar burden on New Zealand in 20 years and needs to be addressed now,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“Students and the public will not tolerate further cuts in tertiary funding. Only an increased investment in tertiary education will see the $5 billion student debt problem solved and our tertiary institutions funded at a decent level.”</p>
<p>“National just can’t give up their slash and burn policies. The economic package announced today signals more cuts to social services and tertiary education will be a prime target as it was last time. We need policies of investment in tertiary education to reduce fees, give greater access to allowances, have better quality institutions and scrap the loan scheme,” said Campbell</p>
<p>“Today Bill English attacked the politics of envy and the punishing of success, but his economic package exemplifies the worst of the politics of meanness,“ said Campbell.</p>
