<p>A Massey University mathematical scientist has discovered a new way to analyse rugby players&#39; performance. The result could help both players and coaches find greater improvements by identifying the important features of an individual&#39;s match play.</p>
<p>Paul Bracewell is in the final stages of a PhD research project with Eagle Sports, part of Eagle Technology, looking for the holy grail of rugby coaching - a fact-rich way to analyse and improve an individual player.</p>
<p>The Foundation for Research, Science and Technology awarded Mr Bracewell a $76,000 Technology in Industry (TIF) Fellowship through Technology New Zealand to carry out the three-year research project and Mr Bracewell believes the techniques that are being developed will be a world first.</p>
<p>The data provided by Eagle Sports uses more than 130 variables, which are a numeric summary of the physical tasks completed by the individual in a match, such as the number of tackles, metres run and number of kicks made.</p>
<p>Mr Bracewell has shown it is possible to distill a player&#39;s game and determine the core components of that individual&#39;s skill set (KPI&#39;s- key performance indicators) using a variety of mathematical techniques.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s showing great promise of becoming a tool that coaches can use easily to determine why a player had a bad game. For instance, the data mining tool is flexible enough to drill down and analyse every tackle taken on a particular side of the body and its outcome,&quot; says Mr Bracewell.</p>

<p>&quot;We used mathematical techniques including multivariate analysis and data mining to develop a way to rate a player objectively and compare one individual against another. We then collapse that information down to a single performance measure by comparing ratings with perfection rather than the average.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Mr Bracewell, the performance rating and the underlying KPIs enable a coach to monitor individual performance with the use of control charts that allows changes in form to be identified. &quot;It means a coach can determine strengths and weaknesses in the player&#39;s underlying KPI&#39;s and skills,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>He believes the process is not restricted to rugby or sports data and is applicable in any field where a summary of data is required to understand performance.</p>
<p>A keen sportsman with family ties to both first class cricket and rugby, Mr Bracewell earlier matched his love of sports to a passion for statistics to complete a Masters thesis on the analysis of cricket statistics</p>
