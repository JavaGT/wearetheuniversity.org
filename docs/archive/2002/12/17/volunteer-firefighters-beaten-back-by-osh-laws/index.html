<p><strong>Tuesday, 17 December 2002, 2:45 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Volunteer firefighters beaten back by OSH laws</p>
<p>Volunteer Firefighters are threatening to turn their backs on brigades if new OSH laws become a reality this week, according to the National Party Industrial Relations spokesman Roger Sowry.</p>
<p>“Here’s a group of caring Kiwis who aren’t afraid to put their lives on the line for others, but this Government’s making Volunteer Brigade chiefs liable for fines of up to $250,000,” Mr Sowry says.</p>
<p>“In its submission on the Health and Safety in Employment Amendment Bill, the United Fire Brigades Association warns ‘ this legislation will deter potential recruits.’</p>
<p>“It continues, ‘ there is the potential for existing volunteer firefighters to withdraw their services to the community due to concern of possible legal consequences.’</p>
<p>“It’s simply wrong to make these community focused people liable for ‘any harm or injury to their crews or the public.’</p>
<p>“There are more than 10 thousand volunteer fire personnel in this country, each and every one of them deserves a medal not a slap in the face,” Mr Sowry says.</p>
<p>“Because that’s what the Health and Safety in Employment Amendment Bill does, it has the potential to erode a valuable community asset.</p>
<p>“The National Party’s launching a last ditch bid to get all volunteers excluded from this legislation when it comes before the House this week.</p>
<p>“If that fails, we at least want to offer volunteer firefighters the protection they deserve,” Mr Sowry says.  </p>
