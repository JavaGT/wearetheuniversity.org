<p><strong>Tuesday, 17 December 2002, 2:37 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Thousands Oppose Labour&#39;s Language Requirement Change</p>
<p>More than 7,000 New Zealanders have delivered a resounding message to the Labour Government that the new language requirements for immigrants are unfair and racist, ACT New Zealand tenth-ranked candidate Kenneth Wang said today.</p>
<p>&quot;At the time of this press release, 7,296 New Zealanders have already signed my petition - to be presented to Parliament today - requesting the Government &quot;abandons the English language tests announced on 19 November and adopts a non-discriminatory immigration policy&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Labour Government&#39;s changes to the English language requirements are a panic reaction to Winston Peters. The move betrays those who voted Labour. The new language test is unreasonably high, and it is racist because immigrants from the UK do not have to sit it. We ask for the Government to revert to the previous language requirements.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of the people who signed the petition are, like me, Asian New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;I am proud to be a New Zealander first. I have lived in this country for seventeen years. I am also proud of my Asian heritage. And I am very proud to be one of the 7,296 New Zealanders who have stood up to the Labour Government and Winston Peters, and declared that we will not accept racist, short-sighted immigration policies in our country,&quot; Mr Wang said.</p>
