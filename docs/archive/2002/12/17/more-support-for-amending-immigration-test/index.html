<p>More Support for Amending Immigration Test</p>
<p>ACT Leader Richard Prebble has presented yet another petition asking that the House of Representatives reconsider the policy requiring that immigrants from non-English speaking countries pass the University level English tests with an unreasonably high score</p>
<p>. &quot;On behalf of Wan Ji (Mount) Kang, the President of the Korean Society, I have presented a petition of 640 names,&quot; said Mr Prebble. &quot;To my knowledge there are now three separate petitions - two Chinese and one Korean - asking the government to look at the discrepancies in treatment of immigrants to this country.</p>
<p>&quot;I am also aware that the petitions have been signed by many of Indian nationality and many others of New Zealand birth.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason for the large numbers of people who have fronted up to sign these petitions over a very short period of time is that the sudden imposition of University level English tests is so savage in its impact. Peoples&#39; lives are going to be totally destroyed by the government&#39;s panic reaction to Winston Peters&#39; popularism.</p>
<p>&quot;Few will dispute that the English language is useful for immigrants. But what is particularly incongruous - and unfair - is the move from an immigration English test requiring a pass level of 4 points (under National) to a 6.5 point level pass under Labour. This is particularly indefensible as Helen Clark campaigned in opposition to raising the points level in the last election,&quot; Mr Prebble said.</p>
