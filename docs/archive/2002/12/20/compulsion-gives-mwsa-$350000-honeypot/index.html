<p><strong>Friday, 20 December 2002, 9:21 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Student_Choice">Student Choice</a></strong></p>
<p>The police investigation into financial irregularities in the accounts of the Massey Wellington Students Association (MWSA) highlights that the fact that the pool of money at risk, the association&#39;s $350,000 income, is derived from compulsory membership, Student Choice said.</p>
<p>Spokesman Clint Heine said the huge amount of money accumulated by compulsory membership made a tempting target for fraudsters. &quot;Every fulltime Massey Wellington student is forced to pay $120 a year to MWSA giving the association an annual income of over $350,000. Polytechnic student associations are particularly susceptible to fraudsters, and over the years there have been numerous cases of misappropriation of funds,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Heine said compulsory membership makes fraud in student associations easier. &quot;Because students are forced to join associations they&#39;re not motivated to take an active interest in the organisations. This gives a small number of individuals control of large amounts of money and makes fraud possible,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Compulsory student associations are not subject to the same discipline as other organisations. If fraud occurs in an ordinary incorporated society people can withdraw their membership and reduce the organisation&#39;s income. However compulsory student associations suffer no penalties for misappropriation of money. Even though Massey students&#39; money has gone missing, in 2003 students will be forced to pay MWSA another $350,000. &quot;This is outrageous,&quot; said Heine.</p>

<p>Ultimately the Labour government is to blame. Steve Maharey&#39;s education amendment act, which makes compulsory membership possible, gives compulsory associations income regardless of how poorly they perform. Labour paints itself as the student&#39;s friend but its policies allow student associations to waste millions of dollars year after year, Heine said.</p>
