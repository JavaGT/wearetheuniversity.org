<p><strong>Tuesday, 10 December 2002, 3:03 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Ageing Immigrants Add To Taxpayer Burden</p>
<p>New Zealand First has asked the Government why it has allowed permanent residence to 14,854 people between the age of 50 and 102 over the past three years.</p>
<p>Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters today pointed out that the Government already spent $100 million annually on benefits for immigrants, refugees and asylum-seekers.</p>
<p>He said that bringing in so many older people would add substantially to this figure because of health and superannuation costs.</p>
<p>“We have not established a viable pension scheme in this country to support our own elderly citizens who have worked and paid taxes all their lives, yet the Government is bringing in thousands of older people who will claim a pension after contributing little or nothing.</p>
<p>“They will also be a burden on our shaky public health system because it is an established fact that people require extra health care as they grow older.</p>
<p>“Many of these immigrants are obviously here because of the family re-unification scheme. It is clear that this policy should be reviewed.</p>
<p>“We admire the spirit of a 102 year old starting off a new life in New Zealand, but we seriously dispute how this person brings diversity and dynamism to our society - or does a 102 year old replace five 20 year olds who have left this country?” asked Mr Peters.</p>
