<p>Fund NCEA implementation properly select committee tells Govt</p>
<p>The Education and Science select committee have rightly unanimously condemned the shambolic implementation of NCEA, and the Government must now move to properly fund the new qualification, says National Education Spokesperson Dr Nick Smith.</p>
<p>“Even Labour members of the committee, who opposed having the inquiry, could not ignore the compelling evidence from principals, boards and teachers that the implementation of NCEA was a mess.</p>
<p>“The committee rightly concludes that the new qualification has lacked leadership, been a software debacle, and been poorly communicated to teachers and students. Even worse, the committee found that schools haven’t received any funding to support the biggest change in school qualifications in 50 years.</p>
<p>“The most significant recommendation is about funding. The committee rejected the Minister’s explanation that the annual increase in the operations grant was sufficient, when it was less than the inflation rate, and no difference was made between primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>“The Government must now move in the supplementary estimates to fairly fund schools for the extra data entry, photography and staff training costs that are essential for NCEA to work.</p>
<p>“The select committee report is a slap in the face for Education Minister Trevor Mallard when his own colleagues conclude the NCEA has been poorly implemented. Sadly, students, teachers, and schools have had to bear the brunt of his errors,” Dr Smith said.</p>
