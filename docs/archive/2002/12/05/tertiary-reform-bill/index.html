<p>The Association of University Staff [AUS] welcomed the passing of legislation today that put in place a range of policy changes and finally established the Tertiary Education Commission [TEC]. “The Tertiary Education Reform Bill has had a long and rocky road,” said AUS National President, Dr Grant Duncan. “While we are not happy with a number of the Bill’s provisions, we do support this Government’s intention to end an era of destructive competition in the tertiary education sector. We also believe that the TEC needs to get on with its work and in particular, with the implementation of new funding frameworks”.</p>
<p>“University staff will be working to ensure that, within the new policy framework which the TEC will administer, the distinctive nature of university education is recognised and protected,” said Dr Duncan. “University staff aspire to a collaborative and collegial culture. We will need to continually reassert the status of the university as an open community that values unfettered inquiry, dialogue and principled dissent.”</p>
<p>Dr Duncan emphasised that university staff make a huge contribution to the knowledge, skills and well-being of the whole community. It was essential, therefore, that changes brought in by the passing of the Bill today are used to support and develop a highly-qualified and skilled university workforce for the achievement of excellence in teaching, research and scholarship.</p>
