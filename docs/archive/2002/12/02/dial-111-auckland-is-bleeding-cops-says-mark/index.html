<p><strong>Monday, 2 December 2002, 2:12 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Dial 111 – Auckland Is Bleeding Cops, Says Mark</p>
<p>The Government is directly responsible for the catastrophe happening to Auckland’s police force, says New Zealand First law and order spokesperson Ron Mark.</p>
<p>He said today that the Government’s lofty claim that it is taking a tough line on crime was “lip service” that fooled no one..</p>
<p>“At the same time Auckland is haemorrhaging experienced police officers and is being forced to spend resources to deal with imported cultural crime, the Government is encouraging people from some of the most corrupt countries in the world to come and be new New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“The New Zealand Police Association president is reported as saying that current immigration policy is putting New Zealanders’ safety at risk, yet the Government ridiculously claims that immigration is for the country’s benefit.</p>
<p>“Why is Auckland police spending tens of thousands on interpreters while officers are showing their anger over poor pay and conditions by quitting the force?”</p>
<p>“The Government clearly puts a higher priority on attracting immigrants to bolster Labour votes than it does on increasing the number of police on the beat.</p>
<p>“Such a slack attitude to the concerns of Auckland police will be glaringly apparent in one arena – crime on the streets of the Government’s marvellously engineered, multi-cultural metropolis,” said Mr Mark.  </p>
