<p>Thousands spent on covering up rotting homes</p>
<p>The Government’s building industry regulator Building Industry Authority has spent $65,000 in six months trying to cover up the rotting homes crisis, National Housing Spokesperson Dr Wayne Mapp revealed today.</p>
<p>In responses to questions from National, Internal Affairs Minister George Hawkins says the Building Industry Authority spent $64,495 on communications, public relations and media advice between May and November this year.</p>
<p>“This shows the BIA has spent a large amount of time trying to cover up the rotting homes crisis and not enough time making any attempt to solve it.<br>“The public have not been fooled by this $65,000 PR exercise. Owners of rotting homes are angry that the Minister and the BIA have been so dismissive about this issue.</p>
<p>“What homeowners want is solutions, not the butt covering that we are seeing.</p>
<p>“The BIA is yet to pick up either of the second two points in National’s strategy to solve the crisis - that is the inspection of all homes built since 1996 and to change the Building Code to ensure that the crisis doesn’t affect any more homes.<br>“The Government has turned a blind eye to this disaster, been flat-footed since it realised its mistake, and is still not providing any solutions to homeowners affected today and those wanting to build homes in future,” Dr Mapp said.</p>
