<p>Georgina te Heuheu</p>
<p>National Maori Spokesperson</p>
<p>29th November 2002</p>
<p>Government anniversary falls flat</p>
<p>The big fanfare about advancing Maori development that accompanied the Labour Government&#39;s taking power in 1999 has translated into a whimper three years on, says National&#39;s Maori spokesperson Georgina te Heuheu.</p>
<p>&#39;In the course of this week I have touched base with Maori in a range of sectors - health, tertiary education, broadcasting, the arts, business and the disappointment at the governments lack of delivery is foremost,&quot; Mrs te Heuheu said.</p>
<p>There is universal agreement that the government&#39;s first three years has been characterised by a lot of hui, a lot of talk, but not much else she said.</p>
<p>&quot;The minister of Maori affairs, Parekura Horomia is a perfect example of the Governments approach. All talk, no delivery.</p>
<p>&quot;In many cases the three years has actually seen the creation of more barriers to progress, particularly in business, where there is a growing segment of Maori.</p>
<p>&quot;By the Minister&#39;s own measures - Closing the Gaps, establishing Maori Television and resolving the fisheries he has failed.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent reports that 1 in 3 children live in poverty, that there is alarming increase in type two diabetes and that New Zealand&#39;s illiteracy rate is running at 10% or more indicates an increasing gap in achievement levels which puts paid to the Minister&#39;s trumpeting of closing gaps.</p>
<p>&quot;His recent inability to put a timeframe around establishing limits and the extent of Fisheries commissioners warrants adds up to failure on his own scorecard,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Actions speak louder than words. The lack of action has definitely not gone unnoticed by the Maori electorate. This government is definitely on notice,&quot; said Mrs te Heuheu.</p>
