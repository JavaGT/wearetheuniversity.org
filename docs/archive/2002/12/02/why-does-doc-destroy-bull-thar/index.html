<p>Why Does DoC Destroy Bull Thar?</p>
<p>The Government must explain why DoC has spent money which could have funded a footbridge or a track or hut upgrade instead slaughtering bull thar worth up to $1 million this year alone says ACT Sports spokesman Stephen Franks.</p>
<p>&quot;On last night&#39;s Sunday programme it showed as simple ideological bloody mindedness.</p>
<p>&quot;Thar are now vulnerable in their Himalayan home. New Zealand is the only country where thar can be safety hunted, and thousands of New Zealanders value the challenge as well as the foreign exchange from guided international visitors.</p>
<p>&quot;If DoC culling was targeted at nannies they might be sincere when they claim it is to control thar populations. Only nannies can grow the population. The numbers are not growing. There is no evidence they are threatening the survival of any endangered plant in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT is lodging many questions to the Minister of Conservation on this grotesque waste of money and opportunity. They are questions that should have been answered before the slaughter began&quot;, Stephen Franks said.</p>
<p>Parliamentary Questions to the Minister of Conservation</p>
<p>· Has the Department of Conservation any measure or estimate of the economic activity currently associated with the commercial hunting of bull thar, and if not why not?</p>
<p>· Has the Department of Conservation any measure of foreign exchange returns attributable to commercial guiding and hunting for male thar, and if so what are they?</p>
