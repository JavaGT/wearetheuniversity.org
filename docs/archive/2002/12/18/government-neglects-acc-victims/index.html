<p><strong>Wednesday, 18 December 2002, 4:10 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Government Neglects Acc Victims</p>
<p>New Zealand First MP and ACC spokesperson Peter Brown has accused the Government of closing down debate on the ACC debacle when there is obviously a serious problem with the system.</p>
<p>“I have asked for an inquiry into ACC procedure and have requested a debate in the House, both of which have been turned down,” said Mr Brown.</p>
<p>“The precedent-setting court case last week could see hundreds of cases reviewed and possibly millions of dollars paid out in back interest to claimants wrongfully treated by ACC.</p>
<p>“This is an issue that affects thousands of people and they have the right to be heard on this issue. On their behalf I have written to the chairperson of the Transport and Industrial Relation Select Committee repeating my request for an inquiry into the:</p>
<p>Interface between ACC and Social Services organization (WINZ) Modus operandi of ACC Disputes Resolution Services Ltd. Accident Claimants Advocacy Service<br>”ACC was implemented so New Zealanders would be compensated for injuries caused through accidents instead of suing the party who caused the accident.</p>
<p>“This organisation is now being sued, and successfully, by the very people it was set-up to help because their cases have been so poorly dealt with. What kind of Mickey Mouse outfit has ACC become?</p>
<p>“The Government has a responsibility to listen and act on what is clearly a major problem,” said Mr Brown.  </p>
