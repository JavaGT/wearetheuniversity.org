<p><strong>Monday, 15 July 2002, 9:27 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>

<p>Thousands of secondary students are heading back to a new school term of strike chaos despite attempts by the Government to claim the teachers&#39; dispute is being sorted, says National Leader Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;The plain facts are the Government has not resolved this dispute, and industrial action is going to hit our secondary schools over the next two weeks, starting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;What is this going to do to the thousands of parents who have struggled through two weeks of rain-soaked school holidays, and are now faced with having their kids sent home from school again?</p>
<p>&quot;Reports that the teachers&#39; dispute has gone into arbitration are wrong. All that&#39;s happened is that Trevor Mallard has proposed to the PPTA a process of Alternative Dispute Resolution. The PPTA can&#39;t enter into arbitration without a vote from teachers and this could take two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard has attempted to band aid the problem and push it out past Election Day, but it&#39;s backfired by upsetting teachers more and hardening the PPTA&#39;s resolve. Helen Clark and Labour have been panicked into giving an impression the dispute&#39;s resolved, no matter what.</p>
<p>&quot;I am proposing today a five-point plan for getting teachers back in the classroom and making sure this industrial dispute doesn&#39;t happen again. National will:</p>
<p>* Negotiate an offer of the order of our settlement in 1999 (3.5% per year) and offer a $2000 allowance for the NCEA to get teachers back in the classroom<br>* Open negotiations on a professional pay structure for teachers that rewards quality and professionalism, and pays good teachers more<br>* Delay level 2 of the NCEA for Year 12 until teacher workload pressures and other problems around it are resolved<br>* Review the NCEA to focus more on achievement and less on assessment<br>* Introduce self-management for schools as a tool for innovation and to allow decision making by teachers, parents and principals.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents are learning the hard way that Labour cares more about their votes than about their children. Parents need to vote for their children&#39;s education by endorsing National&#39;s plan to pull schools out of this industrial mire and restore confidence in secondary education in New Zealand,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
