<p>JAZZ WORKS: Jazz improvisation classes for teachers, at The University of Auckland</p>
<p>Wanted: music teachers who would like to learn jazz from the experts.</p>
<p>The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM) in conjunction with The University of Auckland is offering music teachers and their pupils the opportunity to learn jazz in a series of workshops to be held at the university’s School of Creative and Performing Arts (SCAPA).</p>
<p>Co-ordinator of Music Education at The University of Auckland Chris Naughton, vocalist Maree Sheehan, dance tutor Jacqui Cesan and top line jazz pianist Kirby Wood are presenting the workshops, entitled Jazz Works, in advance of the ABRSM jazz piano exams in November.</p>
<p>Jazz Works will enable piano teachers to experience improvisation in contemporary jazz styles, swing and the blues.</p>
<p>For those not taking exams but who would like to teach jazz they will also find these sessions fun and useful.</p>
<p>Chris Naughton says the workshops will provide a model for piano teachers which they can pass on to their students.</p>
<p>“We are offering the workshops for two reasons: first, there is a real need for students to experience playing jazz with others; second, to allow music teachers to see how they can improvise without having played jazz or having been taught as a jazz musician. It provides an opportunity for music teachers to find out what it is to improvise using their body, their voice, and natural rhythm.”</p>
<p>Teachers who attended last month’s workshop said they enjoyed the variety - dance, singing, group improvisation and playing with the band, and said they would definitely be back for the next sessions.</p>

<p>Space is still available in these ongoing sessions, which are held every month until November when the project will culminate in a jazz concert and dance at The University of Auckland.</p>
<p>The cost is $25 for each three-hour workshop or $100 for all six sessions. The next workshop for piano teachers will be held on July 21 at 12 pm, then subsequent workshops on August 18, September 15, October 20, and November 17 will include students who will be invited to work alongside Kirby Wood, and perform to the class.</p>
<p>If you’re a piano teacher or someone wanting to know more about teaching and experiencing jazz then please call Chris Naughton who can book you a place on this exciting new course in jazz education.</p>
