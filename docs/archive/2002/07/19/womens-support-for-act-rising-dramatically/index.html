<p>Women&#39;s Support for ACT Rising Dramatically</p>
<p>Thursday 18 Jul 2002</p>
<p>ACT&#39;s anti-NCEA stance endorsed by independent survey</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand President Catherine Judd said today the party&#39;s polling shows a dramatic increase in support for ACT from women. &quot;Among those intending to vote for ACT in this election 41.7% are women. Also, among those identified as ACT potential voters 46% are women. This compares with just 16% at the 1999 election,&quot; Ms Judd said.</p>
<p>&quot;One of my objectives when I became President was to attract more women to support ACT and it is clear we have achieved that. &quot;I believe we have achieved this by focusing on the issues during the campaign that are important to women and their families and presenting them in ways that are honest and clear,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our Zero Tolerance for Crime and Truth-in-Sentencing policies in relation to the current violent crime wave is something that women are particularly concerned about. They want to know that it is safe for them and their children to go walking on our streets.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT&#39;s specific commitment to address falling standards in education and to scrap the NCEA has also clearly resonated with women. I have personally been running a parents&#39; campaign on this issue because it is one that I&#39;ve taken a strong personal interest in over several years, as a parent and a school trustee.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;ACT&#39;s concerns about the NCEA have been strongly reinforced by a new nationwide survey of teachers released yesterday by Christchurch teacher David Newton. It shows that 83% of teachers do not think the NCEA should continue to be implemented in its present form, 71% say the NCEA workload is such that they are seriously considering leaving the teaching profession, and 80% do not think the NCEA will be recognised as a valid and robust system by students, parents, employers and educationalists here or overseas.</p>

<p>&quot;The survey covers 1540 teachers from 89 schools.</p>
<p>&quot;Promoting world-class education has always been a key ACT policy, as our members and supporters have always understood its importance to our children&#39;s future and New Zealand&#39;s growth and prosperity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Women also know that growing the economy is the only way for them, their families and New Zealand to get ahead in the world. We must have a first world economy to pay for first world health care and education.</p>
<p>&quot;Women know that a Tax Cut For Every Worker will mean more money in their pockets. It is the mothers that also know that by cutting taxes, reducing red-tape to grow the New Zealand economy is how we will encourage our children overseas to come back,&quot; Ms Judd said.</p>
