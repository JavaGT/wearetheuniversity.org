<p>Grant Tyrrell National Youth Vice President 19 July 2002</p>
<p>For immediate release</p>
<p>National Youth Vice President joins student protest</p>
<p>Canterbury University Students took to the streets today to demonstrate against mounting student debt.</p>
<p>&quot;I joined over 2000 of my fellow students marching through Christchurch protesting over the massive increase in student debt,&quot; National&#39;s Youth Vice President Grant Tyrrell stated.</p>
<p>&quot;Students are feeling betrayed by this government. Labour promised to attack student debt but instead debt has exploded. It is now running at over $5 billion - an increase of over $2 billion dollars in less than three years.</p>
<p>&quot;Students are rightfully sceptical about Labour promises this election and were outraged that neither Helen Clark or Steve Mahery could be bothered turning up.</p>
<p>&quot;Bill English by contrast fronted up and National&#39;s You Stay We Pay scheme was well received. Under a National-led government graduates will get 10% of their student loans written off for the first five years that they work in New Zealand. This will be a tangible saving of thousands of dollars and years of repayment time for most students.</p>
<p>&quot;National is the only party fronting up to students - on July 27 a vote for National is a vote for a better future,&quot; Grant Tyrrell concluded.</p>
