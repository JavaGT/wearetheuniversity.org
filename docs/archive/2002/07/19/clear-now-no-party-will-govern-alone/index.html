<p>Clear Now No Party Will Govern Alone</p>
<p>The four most recent political polls clearly show no single party will be able to govern alone after the election, says National Party Leader Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;The media commentators are right, the honeymoon is well and truly over for Helen Clark and she is now paying for the arrogance of thinking she could govern alone.</p>
<p>&quot;It comes as no surprise that Labour is continuing to drop in popularity. Helen Clark has failed the students of New Zealand, education is a mess. She has failed patients as our health system continues to go further into overdraft and her soft approach to law and order is an insult to the 92 per cent of us who voted for tougher sentences.</p>
<p>&quot;Centre right parties are now benefiting and it is important that this country has a strong National Party.</p>
<p>&quot;What I am now saying to voters is for them to vote for what they believe in. This means if they want the best in education, tougher sentencing, and real growth in the economy then there is only one party than can deliver. That is National,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
