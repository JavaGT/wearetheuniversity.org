<p><strong>Monday, 8 July 2002, 10:17 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>7 July 2002</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) says that the National Party tertiary education policy released today would leave the tertiary sector in an even bigger mess than when they were last in power and will result in students graduating with higher debts.</p>
<p>“This policy is worse that what National implemented between 1990 and 1999 when they wrecked the tertiary education sector through chronic underfunding,” said NZUSA Co-President Andrew Campbell. “National looks set to pay for this policy by reducing their investment in tertiary education.”</p>
<p>“There is nothing in this policy for current students. There is no increase in access to allowances, there seems to be nothing to stop fee rises and they will allow unlimited competition in the sector. National got voted out on these policies last time and they are dreaming if they think people will vote for them now,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“The answer to the student debt crisis is simple - lowering fees and increasing access to allowances. This policy is superficially attractive but in reality would be unworkable and unfair. The introduction of a bonding scheme does nothing to address the current student debt crisis,” said Campbell</p>
<p>“Women who take time out of the workforce to have children won’t even qualify for debt write offs. With this policy National demonstrates that they are not the pro family party they claim to be,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“This policy reads like the ACT policy with its attacks on students and public education. National is looking less and less like a mainstream political party and are completely out of step with public opinion.”</p>
