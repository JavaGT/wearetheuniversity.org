<p>Government should demand Saffi&#39;s immediate release</p>
<p>Green Party Foreign Affairs spokesperson Keith Locke today said US officials were not telling the truth when they said Mohammed Saffi needed a student visa to do a flight systems test in Miami.</p>
<p>&quot;It is quite clear from the State Department website (travel.state.govt) that those who &#39;take a short course of study of less than 18 hours per week&#39; do not need a student visa,&quot; said Mr Locke.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Saffi was only going to be at the flight school for two days this week, and two days next week - to get his aircraft engineering certification for 727 planes updated. The US authorities were fully informed of Mr Saffi&#39;s background and what he was doing before he even left New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very disappointing that our government has not defended the rights of Mr Saffi as a New Zealand citizen and demanded the US authorities release him from custody,&quot; said Mr Locke.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign Minister Phil Goff seems to have bought the phoney excuse that there was a visa irregularity.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever the anti-terrorist hysteria in the United States, Mr Goff should not use concern about terrorists as a justification for the American victimisation of Mr Saffi.</p>
<p>&quot;We must stand up for the rights of all New Zealanders. The American authorities should release Mr Saffi and let him do his flight simulator test,&quot; said Mr Locke.</p>
