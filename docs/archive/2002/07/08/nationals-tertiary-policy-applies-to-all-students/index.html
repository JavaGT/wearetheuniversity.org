<p>Maurice Williamson</p>
<p>National Tertiary Spokesperson</p>
<p>7 July 2002</p>
<p>National&#39;s tertiary policy applies to all students</p>
<p>National&#39;s &#39;You Stay, We pay&#39; Tertiary Education Policy applies to all students graduating from Polytechnics, Colleges of Education, Universities and Wänanga, says National&#39;s Tertiary Education spokesman Maurice Williamson.</p>
<p>Mr Williamson was replying to criticisms levelled at the policy, which was released today by Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey has obviously been affected by Helen Clark&#39;s new low standards in honesty.</p>
<p>&quot;Is he really opposed to this policy in principle or is he just nitpicking? Even Labour&#39;s new-found coalition partner the Greens agree with the principle of rebating debt.</p>
<p>&quot;In 2000, there were 60,645 students who graduated with degrees, diplomas and certificates, of which 33,355 left tertiary institutions with debt. This has been the basis on which we costed our policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Contrary to Mr Maharey&#39;s other claim, National has not ruled out continuing the fees stabilisation initiatives.</p>
<p>&quot;Meanwhile, he should really wait until our industry training policy is released on Thursday before making more silly comments,&quot; Mr Williamson added.</p>
