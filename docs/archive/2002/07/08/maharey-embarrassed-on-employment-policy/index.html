<p>Bob Simcock</p>
<p>National Employment Spokesperson</p>
<p>5th July 2002</p>
<p>Maharey embarrassed on employment policy</p>
<p>Maharey&#39;s tirade against National&#39;s employment policy shows how insecure he feels about his own performance as Minister of Social Services, says National&#39;s employment spokesman Bob Simcock</p>
<p>&quot;His constant reference to the unemployment rates shows he is uncomfortable looking at what is actually happening to New Zealand families as a result of his management.</p>
<p>&quot;If things are going so well why are food banks in such demand?</p>
<p>&quot;Why do we have 18,000 young people under twenty years of age living on welfare?</p>
<p>&quot;Why are so many people over forty finding it impossible to even get an interview for a job?</p>
<p>&quot;Why is the forestry industry still finding it hard to get anyone to work in low skill jobs?</p>
<p>&quot;The answer is that Maharey has overseen a period of lowered expectations, where work is increasingly seen as optional. His low expectations for his fellow New Zealanders are a betrayal of the three hundred and seventy thousand people who have to live on welfare.</p>
<p>&quot;When it comes to dealing with unemployment the Labour Government has been comfortable harvesting the easy fruit and leaving the rest to rot,&quot; said Mr Simcock.</p>
