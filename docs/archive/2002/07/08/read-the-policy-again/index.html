<p>Maurice Williamson</p>
<p>National Tertiary Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>7th July 2002</p>
<p>Read the policy again</p>
<p>&quot;The New Zealand Universities Students Association (NZUSA) need to get their facts right on National&#39;s Tertiary education policy,&quot; says National&#39;s spokesman Maurice Williamson.</p>
<p>&quot;National will increase investment in tertiary education, not reduce it.</p>
<p>&quot;The student loan write-off policy is not bonding - students are totally free to go on an OE. What the policy does is give people an incentive to stay and invest in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;The policy does not discriminate against women. Women and men who take time out from the workforce to have children are eligible for the write-off, as long as they aren&#39;t on a benefit.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s vague promises to tinker with allowances only benefit a few, whereas National&#39;s policy benefits all students, beginning with those who graduate in 2002. This write-off policy will make a huge dent in debt for all students, and NZUSA shouldn&#39;t be afraid to admit this.</p>
<p>&quot;Would NZUSA prefer that students are left to pay off their full amount of debt themselves? I doubt it,&quot; said Mr Williamson.</p>
