<p>Nandor urges young people to get active, enrol and vote</p>
<p>Green Youth Affairs Spokesperson Nandor Tanczos and 22-year-old local candidate Cathy Olsen today pushed the point that people can enrol to vote right up until the day before the election.</p>
<p>During a visit to the Youthzone centre in Hamilton today Nandor said there were still 185,000 unenrolled voters. In Hamilton only 54 per cent of people aged 18 to 24 are on the role.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of our Green policies are of major interest to young people, Our tertiary policies such as our commitment to universal student allowances and an end to the loans scheme; keeping GE in the lab; policy to ban battery hen cages and sow crates for pigs and a strong commitment to our environment.</p>
<p>&quot;These are some of the things that young people are telling us that they are concened about. We are encouraging young people to get involved and Get On The Roll if they want to see action on these things.&quot; said Nandor.</p>
<p>Today the Greens sent a postcard to 43,000 newly enrolled voters under the age of 37 promoting core Green policies and congratulating them on getting enrolled.</p>
<p>&quot;People need to know they can still enrol to vote right up until the day before the election and this is the message the Greens are pushing across the country, but in places like Hamilton especially. Late enrollers need to make a special vote on election day, but those votes are crucuial. It was the special votes that got the Greens into Parliament at the last election.</p>

<p>&quot;We are getting really positive feedback from students and young people around New Zealand who share the Green vision for a clean green nation that actively promotes education and leads the world in producing clean food and clean technology.</p>
<p>&quot;The huge number of unenrolled voters could make a massive difference to the future of this country. These votes could guarantee that GE was not released into our environment, that students were supported during tertiary education and that teachers were paid what they are worth and were back in the classrooms,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a crucial election for young people. The Greens have policies that address many of the areas of concern to young people, but the one message we really want to get through is this: you can make a difference. Get involved. Get on the Roll. Vote.&quot;</p>
