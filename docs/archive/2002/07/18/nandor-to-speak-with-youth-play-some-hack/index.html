<p>Nandor to speak with youth, play some hack</p>
<p>Green Youth Affairs Spokesperson Nandor Tanczos will play some hack and talk with young people about Green policy and the importance of getting involved at Youthzone in Bryce Street, Hamilton, tomorrow at midday.</p>
<p>Nandor will join local 22-year-old Green candidate Cathy Olsen to discuss a package of Green policies that are of particular interest to youth - such as tertiary education, genetic engineering, animal welfare and the environment - and listen to issues of concern to young people.</p>
<p>Nandor said he was particularly pleased to hold the meeting in Hamilton because only 54 per cent of Hamiltonians aged 18 to 24 were enrolled to vote, and the Greens wanted to turn that around.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greens are pushing our Get on the Roll campaign even harder over these last two weeks. It is not too late for people to enrol to vote - it can be done right up until the day before polling day - and we are urging all New Zealanders to do it now.&quot;</p>
