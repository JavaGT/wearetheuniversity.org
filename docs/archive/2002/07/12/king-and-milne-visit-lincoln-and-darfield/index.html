<p><strong>Friday, 12 July 2002, 10:00 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>10 July 2002</p>
<p>Today Labour Candidate for Rakaia, Tony Milne, escorted Minister of Health Annette King, on a visit to Lincoln and Darfield hospitals to speak to staff and residents and spread Labour’s good news for Rakaia.</p>
<p>“These hospitals are an important part of our local community. A Labour government has made it clear their future is secure”, Tony Milne said.</p>
<p>“This visit was a particularly important one for me. As a worker at a youth health centre, I know how important our health services are”, Tony Milne said.</p>
<p>“Labour has a lot of good news stories to tell the people of this electorate”, Tony Milne said.</p>
<p>- Recently Annette King announced a $32 Million dollar rural health package - more than rural health has ever had in one go</p>
<p>- The 2002 budget sets aside $15 million to help small communities build or re-new their sewage systems.</p>
<p>- Labour has also announced it will introduce scholarship and bonding arrangements, which can be used to address pressing recruitment and retention issues (such as current issues with the retention of doctors) as they arise, in partnership with the industry.</p>
<p>“All of these initiatives will significantly benefit this electorate”, Mr Milne said.</p>
<p>“Its great to know that as an MP I will be a government MP and will be able to achieve so much more for this electorate, our hospitals and rural health services than an opposition MP”, Tony Milne said.</p>
