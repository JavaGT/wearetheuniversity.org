<p><strong>Wednesday, 10 July 2002, 10:12 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>9 July 2002</p>
<p>Students around the country will be publicising their case for a universal student allowance to early morning commuters by hanging banners tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>“These banners send a clear message to voters that investment in students and tertiary institutions needs to be a priority of the next government. We need to stop debt in its tracks and that means lowering fees and increasing access to allowances,” said New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) Co-President Andrew Campbell.</p>
<p>“To date this has been a boring election campaign. Students are now trying to get the public to focus on the big issue. That’s why we are hanging banners – to get the issue of student debt directly in the public eye,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“Student debt will cripple our economy and society. We want voters to consider parties that are offering policies to reduce debt, in particular those offering a universal student allowance when they vote on July 27,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“Students want this election to be about investment in education. If another election goes by without a significant reinvestment into tertiary education we will face a very real crisis within the sector,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
