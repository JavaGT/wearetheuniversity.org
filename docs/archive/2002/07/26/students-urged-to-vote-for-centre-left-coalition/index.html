<p>Students Urged to Vote For Centre Left Coalition</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is encouraging tertiary students to vote for a centre left coalition government tomorrow to ensure that universal student allowances and reduced fees are high priorities for the next government.</p>
<p>“We have looked at all the party policies and only Labour’s potential coalition partners are offering both a universal allowance and fee reductions. Labour has indicated in its policy that it is willing to move on allowance eligibility, so it’s not a wasted vote to elect a coalition partner that will push this issue further,” said NZUSA Co-President Andrew Campbell.</p>
<p>“In a poll conducted by Colmar Brunton last month 80% of New Zealanders supported a universal living allowance for tertiary students. This will only happen if a centre left coalition government is elected on Saturday,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“The 90s saw National cut access to allowances and increase fees every year. The past three years have seen a stabilisation of the student loans problem but no solution. Only correcting the drivers of student debt; high fees and lack of living allowances will solve the problem,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“Students have been campaigning for a universal allowance all year. This election is an opportunity for New Zealanders to attack student debt and elect a government that will introduce a universal allowance,” said Campbell.</p>
