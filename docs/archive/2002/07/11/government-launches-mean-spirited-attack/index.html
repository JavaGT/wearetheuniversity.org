<p>Government Launches Mean Spirited Attack on Dentistry Graduates</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is describing the governments move to appeal a High Court decision over dentistry funding cuts as a mean spirited attack on highly indebted graduates.</p>
<p>In April the High Court determined that the previous National government had erred in reducing dental tuition subsidies, which resulted in dentistry fees doubling to $20,000 a year.</p>
<p>“It is ironic that one of the first acts of this government was to fix the cut in dental funding, and one of it’s last is to defend it,” said NZUSA Co-President Andrew Campbell.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of dental graduates were forced into unacceptably high levels of debt as a result of the National governments policy. Those students then went on to win their case in court. To appeal that decision is nothing less than mean spirited and short sighted,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“The government must stop defending National government policy, and stop these dentistry graduates joining the exodus of professionals going overseas. Compensating them as the High Court advised is essential,” said Campbell.</p>
