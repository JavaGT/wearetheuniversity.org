<p><strong>Tuesday, 2 July 2002, 1:34 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>1 July, 2002</p>
<p>A National Government will not let New Zealand become a “defence beneficiary” as Labour intends through its plans for the future structure of the country’s defence forces, says Richard Worth, National Party Defence Spokesman.</p>
<p>The MP for Epsom said today that Labour’s concept of defence planning was “tragi-comic” in that it aimed for a nation surrounded by thousands of miles of ocean to run down its navy while building up its land forces.</p>
<p>“Is it any wonder that our friends abroad regard us as unrealistic when it comes to defence planning under the current Government? The Australians already see us as defence beneficiaries, bludging for a future defence capability on their taxpayers.</p>
<p>“We can’t afford to have Canberra view us in that light because it impinges on all other aspects of our trans-Tasman relationship including trade, agricultural product access and social welfare provisions.</p>
<p>“The authors of the Green Paper on defence have done us a service in pointing up the deficiencies in our defence planning. I thank them for it. National must accept some of the criticism in the constructive manner in which it has been offered. Our policy is aimed at setting matters right.”</p>
