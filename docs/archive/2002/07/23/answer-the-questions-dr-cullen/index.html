<p><strong>Tuesday, 23 July 2002, 1:38 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>

<p>Answer the questions Dr Cullen...</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday I challenged the Minister of Finance to answer 20 questions about how Labour&#39;s policies will help get New Zealand back to the top half of the OECD.</p>
<p>&quot;So far his silence has been deafening,&quot; says National&#39;s Finance spokesman David Carter.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Cullen has been about as compliant and shifty on answering my 20 questions as the Prime Minister was with the police during the Paintergate debacle.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the questions I have asked Michael Cullen are ones he must answer before Labour can claim any credibility about achieving 4% economic growth,&quot; Mr Carter says.</p>
