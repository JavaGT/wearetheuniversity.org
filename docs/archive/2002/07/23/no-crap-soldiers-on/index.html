<p>NO CRAP soldiers on.</p>
<p>The controversial youth political website <a href="http://www.nocrap.org.nz">www.nocrap.org.nz</a> <a href="http://www.nocrap.org.nz/">http://www.nocrap.org.nz/</a> has received it&#39;s second complaint to the Electoral Commission, with claims the site encourages violence and features inappropriate language and content.*</p>
<p>&quot;The complainants are taking themselves far too seriously,&quot; says spokesperson Jamie Simpson. &quot;Anyone with a sense of humour can appreciate this site. We have no intentions of removing any of the offending content.</p>
<p>&quot;The site is all about making politics less boring and serious, and more interesting for young people.&quot;</p>
<p>The site was built by a group of young people from around the country who believe that National is the best choice this election.</p>
<p>&quot;The internet is one of the most effective ways to reach people and get our message across. So far the site has been a huge success, with over a hundred thousand hits and overwhelmingly positive feedback.&quot;</p>
<p>The entertaining and provocative site features a guide to all political parties, jokes, satire, competitions, photos and interactive polls. The site is updated regularly.</p>

<p>To whom it may concern</p>
<p>I would like to lay a complaint over the National Party&#39;s youth website &quot;No Crap.&quot; In particular I would like to know whether the following content is acceptable for an official political website:</p>
<p>Advertisement - scroll to continue reading</p>
<p>-Jokes about Bill Clinton and oral sex<br>-A sexually suggestive picture of MP George Hawkins<br>-Use of profanities, including the F and S words<br>-A link to a &quot;picture of a man with a huge cock&quot;</p>
<p>I do not believe this kind of garbage should be allowed to be published in the buildup to a general election.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br>Xxxx</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#39;m writing in regards to some content located at <a href="http://www.nocrap.org.nz/hippies.htm">http://www.nocrap.org.nz/hippies.htm</a> which is a site being run by the National Party as part of their campaign. I&#39;m particularly concerned about how this particular page seems to be advocating the use of violence as an effective means of expressing your opinion.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>xxxx</p>
