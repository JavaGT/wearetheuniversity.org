<p><strong>Friday, 5 July 2002, 3:10 pm</strong><br><strong>Speech: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Friday 5 Jul 2002</p>
<p>Speech by ACT leader Richard Prebble, outside the IRD Christchurch office, Cashel Mall, Christchurch, on Friday 5th July 2002 at 1.30pm</p>
<p>I&#39;ve come here to the IRD in Christchurch because today is the last working day before July 7^th for filing company tax returns.</p>
<p>ACT has chosen Christchurch to make this statement because the manufacturers in this city are exporters. Christchurch&#39;s manufacturing base is being crippled by having to pay the highest company tax rates of any of our trading competitors.</p>
<p>The government&#39;s own McLeod Tax Review has stated that New Zealand companies can&#39;t compete when Australia&#39;s company tax rate is now below ours.</p>
<p>In the past, it was the policy of successive governments to always have a lower tax rate than Australia, so that our companies could attract investment, and create jobs and growth. But this Labour government has abandoned the policy of lower taxes than Australia.</p>
<p>Australia&#39;s company tax rate is now 30 percent - New Zealand&#39;s is 33 percent. ACT is campaigning to immediately drop New Zealand&#39;s company tax rate to 28 percent - below Australia.</p>
<p>Helen Clark this week told the nation that only Mexico has lower taxes than New Zealand. The Prime Minister&#39;s statement is false. Our Prime Minister is either totally ignorant of things economic, or she is lying - or possibly both.</p>
<p>Here are the facts.</p>
<p>The Labour/Alliance/Green government taxes companies very harshly. Only Denmark and Sweden in the OECD have higher taxes on income and company profits than New Zealand.</p>

<p>In the last three years, 16 nations in the OECD have reduced taxes. Only New Zealand has increased income tax.</p>
<p>Now, with a rising Kiwi dollar, the folly of having higher company tax rates than our competitors is being seen.</p>
<p>Very little investment has been attracted to new greenfield businesses. Most foreign capital is hot money coming to take advantage of our rising interest rates.</p>
<p>McLeod also reported that New Zealand&#39;s effective rate of income tax is relatively high.</p>
<p>This was confirmed recently in a study by the accounting firm KPMG, which found that New Zealanders pay higher tax on low and medium incomes than in Australia, the UK, the US or Canada.</p>
<p>Low-income workers in New Zealand, typically students and people starting their careers, pay the highest rate of income tax in the world. My son Malcolm is a university student. Today he is working as a painter in the university holidays. He is paying an effective income tax rate of 21 cents.</p>
<p>In Tony Blair&#39;s Labour Britain, the tax rate on someone earning $20,000 is just 3.2 percent. No wonder our graduates go overseas to repay their student loans.</p>
<p>ACT proposes to immediately adopt the McLeod tax report suggestion of just two income tax rates - 28 cents and 18 cents. No one will be worse off. It will give every working person a tax cut.</p>
<p>A school teacher on $40,000 will be $670 in the hand better off.</p>
<p>ACT is proposing, in effect, a pay rise for every worker.</p>
<p>There are now 400,000 beneficiaries. For too many of them, they are better off being on a benefit than working. ACT&#39;s tax package will encourage more beneficiaries back into the work force.</p>
<p>So here is the real choice. Labour is campaigning on a pledge to keep our company tax rates higher than our trading partners&#39;, and to keep income tax for New Zealanders earning less than $60,000, higher than Australia, the UK, the US and Canada.</p>
<p>I challenge Helen Clark. The Automobile Association said today that this government, if re-elected, is going to increase petrol tax by up to $1 a litre.</p>
<p>And the so-called health tax, which Michael Cullen yesterday admitted the government is considering, is really a way of increasing income tax. Labour says the health tax of 8 percent will be matched by an equivalent cu tin income tax, so there will be no net increase.</p>
<p>I warn the public, that&#39;s what Labour said when it introduced GST. Helen Clark and Dr Cullen then increased GST from 10 percent to 12.5 percent.</p>
<p>If a health tax is introduced, then in the next Budget the government can increase it - and technically they haven&#39;t broken Labour&#39;s credit card promise.</p>
<p>Labour and the Greens are tax, spend and bust Socialists.</p>
<p>Only ACT is campaigning to give every worker a tax cut.</p>
<p>To send the government a clear message, you can use your party vote for ACT as a referendum to cut taxes below Australia, and give every worker a tax cut.</p>
