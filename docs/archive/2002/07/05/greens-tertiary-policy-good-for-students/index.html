<p><strong>Friday, 5 July 2002, 4:08 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>5 July 2002</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is welcoming the Greens tertiary education policy released today, in particular its promise of a universal student allowance.</p>
<p>“Students want a universal allowance and its good to see the Greens promising it. As a potential coalition partner for Labour after the election we encourage the Greens to be as staunch on allowances as they have been on GE,” said NZUSA Co-President Andrew Campbell.</p>
<p>“80% of New Zealanders said they support a universal student allowance in a Colmar Brunton poll commissioned by NZUSA released earlier this week. The Greens policy is in line with what the majority of New Zealanders clearly want,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“The only way to solve the student debt crisis is to increase access to allowances and reduce fees. The Greens are offering both.”</p>
<p>“With all Labour’s potential coalition partners supporting a universal student allowance, Labour are looking increasingly isolated with their vague policy to increase access to allowances,” said Campbell. “If Labour are truly committed to stopping student debt they need to clarify their position on allowances so students can make an informed vote on July 27.”</p>
<p>“If we want to avoid the student debt crisis we need to invest in students. With the election looming we encourage people to use their vote sensibly and vote for parties who are prepared to make a major reinvestment back into tertiary education,” said Campbell.</p>
