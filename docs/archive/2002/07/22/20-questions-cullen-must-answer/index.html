<p>20 Questions Cullen Must Answer</p>
<p>National&#39;s Finance spokesman David Carter is challenging Michael Cullen to provide real answers on how Labour intends enhancing New Zealand&#39;s future economic prospects.</p>
<p>Mr Carter has issued Dr Cullen a list of 20 questions asking for Labour&#39;s proposals to increase growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Cullen is always quick to give smug, glib answers on totally irrelevant issues. However, he&#39;s been far less forthcoming in explaining just how Labour will achieve anything near the 4 per cent growth our economy needs to get ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;The reality is that for the past two years the Labour/Alliance Government has ridden on the back of a low dollar, favourable climatic conditions and high commodity prices and has no plans for taking New Zealand forward.</p>
<p>&quot;All the economic indicators point to a sharp decline in our economic outlook, with the latest forecasts predicting annual growth to fall to 2 per cent in the next year. While Dr Cullen makes all the right noises about increasing growth, his rhetoric is simply not matched by any plan of action.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Carter says unlike Labour, National has a serious and substantial economic plan, which is focused on increasing New Zealand&#39;s long-term, sustainable growth rate.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s Business New Zealand survey confirms that National&#39;s economic framework will be far better for growth than Labour&#39;s.</p>
<p>&quot;I challenge Dr Cullen to answer each of these important questions,&quot; Mr Carter says.</p>
