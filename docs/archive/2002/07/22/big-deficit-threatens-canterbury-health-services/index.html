<p>Big Deficit Threatens Canterbury Health Services</p>
<p>The future of Canterbury GP services hanging in the balance shows that the region&#39;s health system is only just being held together, says National Health Spokesperson Roger Sowry.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of its large $23m deficit, the Canterbury District Health Board is considering cutting back or dropping some of the services it funds. Pegasus is Canterbury&#39;s largest GP and deserves certainty with its contract.</p>
<p>&quot;These deficit cuts are putting Canterbury primary health care services at risk. The Canterbury board cannot confirm that there won&#39;t be disruptions to health services in the region this week.</p>
<p>&quot;Here we have a board with a poor record when dealing with disruptions, with a large deficit they simply can&#39;t wipe without cuts to services, and at the same time Labour is claiming that voters should believe that Labour is looking after health services.</p>
<p>&quot;This board has such a high deficit and has services at risk because the Government has not funded it adequately. National will wipe district health board deficits and put more money into health services,&quot; Mr Sowry said.</p>
