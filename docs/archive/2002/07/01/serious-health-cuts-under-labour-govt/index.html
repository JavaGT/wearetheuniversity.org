<p><strong>Monday, 1 July 2002, 10:54 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>

<p>Waitemata and Counties Manukau couples affected by infertility will be left without tertiary fertility services if two district health boards cut fertility services, says National&#39;s Associate Health spokesperson Dr Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;This equates to more than 100 babies not being born in Auckland next year.&quot;</p>
<p>The Waitemata and Counties Manukau District Health Boards have given notice that they may stop purchasing infertility treatment within 12 months. Those affected have little time to comment before a final decision is made in early July.</p>
<p>&quot;Axing these important services is yet another example of this Government&#39;s underfunding of health. Half of the country&#39;s 21 district health boards have already indicated service cuts are likely because of growing deficits.</p>
<p>&quot;Only two weeks ago, Health Minister Annette King told the New Zealand Infertility Society the Government would look favourably at increasing funding for fertility services. She was obviously spinning a line, or totally unaware that Waitemata, who also hold the contract to provide fertility services to Counties, was planning to cut services because of underfunding.</p>
<p>&quot;National has announced it will increase funding for fertility treatment so that couples can be funded for up to three cycles of IVF, compared to one they can get now.</p>
<p>&quot;Waitemata CEO Dwayne Crombie says it is looking at cutting a range of services.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Hutchison says National, during its last two terms in Government, increased health spending by an average of 6.1% a year above inflation. He says despite increasing taxes and promising better health services for all Labour has only increased health spending by 3.5%.</p>
<p>&quot;Waitemata is just one of many DHBs facing serious health cuts. These proposed cuts are testament to Labour&#39;s abysmal record in health,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
