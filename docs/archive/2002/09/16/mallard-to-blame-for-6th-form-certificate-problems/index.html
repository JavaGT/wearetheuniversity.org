<p>Mallard to blame for Sixth Form Certificate problems</p>
<p>Dr Nick Smith - National Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>The education system is struggling to keep up with Trevor Mallard’s flip-flops over the NCEA, says National’s Education spokesperson Nick Smith.</p>
<p>“The uncertainty over NCEA is furthering the confusion in secondary education. After 12 months of industrial disruption the sector is craving for certainty.</p>
<p>“The Minister was first warned over a year ago about the problems with the NCEA, but he refused to listen and blundered on. Then a month ago he suddenly backtracked and announced Level 2 will now be ‘optional’.</p>
<p>“Only 10 weeks away from the end of the school year, it’s unbelievable that many students still don’t know what qualification they’ll be doing next year.</p>
<p>“It’s grossly unfair for students who were guinea pigs this year to be guinea pigs again next year. They only get one shot at school qualifications, which can have such a big impact on their future.</p>
<p>“National’s position has always been clear: don’t roll out Level 2 NCEA until the problems with Level 1 have been sorted.</p>
<p>“Students, parents and teachers are sick of Mallard’s dithering. He has made a mess of the teachers’ pay dispute, a mess of the NCEA implementation, and it’s doing irreparable damage to secondary education,” said Dr Smith.</p>
