<p>Select Committee Must Examine Leaky Building Crisis</p>
<p>ACT Commerce Spokesman Deborah Coddington is calling on the Commerce Select Committee to conduct an inquiry into leaky buildings as a fast and achievable way to address issues of responsibility.</p>
<p>Miss Coddington is writing to Labour MP Mark Peck, chair of the Commerce Select Committee, urging the Committee to set up an immediate inquiry.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Party is calling for a full &#39;public inquiry&#39;. That&#39;s hugely expensive, whereas a Select Committee inquiry could start immediately and actually require Ministers to front up.</p>
<p>&quot;Leaky buildings are a major problem affecting thousands of new homes and units around the country. The repair bill is going to be over $200m, and it appears that both this Government and the former National Government may be at fault.</p>
<p>&quot;In the 1990s under pressure from the Greens and environmentalists, the Government changed the long-standing requirement that all pine used in construction be treated. While there are other reasons for leaky buildings, the problem would be minor if it were not for the amount of untreated timber being used.</p>
<p>&quot;A public inquiry is just not going to happen. National knows this - that&#39;s probably why National MP Wayne Mapp is calling for one. His party changed the rules regarding treated timber. National is partly responsible.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a proper matter for a select committee, and I hope that Mr Peck and the members of the Commerce Select Committee will accept their responsibility,&quot; Miss Coddington said.  </p>
