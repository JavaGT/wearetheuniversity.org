<p><strong>Wednesday, 18 September 2002, 2:56 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>The Royal New Zealand Navy and Victoria University today signed an agreement that will see the development of a close working relationship as the Navy seeks to align its education and training with tertiary qualifications.<br>The Memorandum of Agreement was signed by Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon and Captain Pat Williams RNZN, of the Navy’s Fleet Personnel and Training Organisation and follows the Navy last year calling for proposals for a tertiary provider with which to develop a long-term relationship.<br>“This partnership with Victoria University will assist the Navy as we continue towards our vision of being &#39;the best small nation navy in the world,’” said Captain Pat Williams, RNZN.<br>Professor McCutcheon said Victoria’s new School of Government, officially launched by the Prime Minister Rt Hon Helen Clark last week, will be responsible for the agreement from the University’s side.<br>“Our agreement with the Navy is an excellent example of the kind of relationships and the level of responsiveness to the public sector’s workforce education needs we are seeking to enhance with the establishment of this new School. Victoria’s staff members, both within the new School and elsewhere in the University, have a wealth of teaching and research expertise in a wide range of topics and disciplines.”<br>The agreement will see the Navy gaining credit recognition towards Victoria qualifications for in-service training conducted at the Navy’s officer training school at Auckland’s Devonport Naval Base. Professor McCutcheon said the academic approval process for credit recognition was well underway. The University had already been involved in the re-development of the Navy’s Maritime Strategy Paper, which is being delivered at the Naval Base in November this year.<br>The agreement is similar to an arrangement between Victoria and the New Zealand Police, which has been in place for two years.<br>Professor McCutcheon said the agreement provided a basis for working together to identify study options and qualifications to allow naval personnel to complete a range of undergraduate and graduate degree programmes while working.<br>“We are looking forward to our on-going discussions about direction and content, within a Joint Force context. As part of this development I am very pleased with current discussions within the University about the introduction of Strategic Studies as a field of study here at Victoria. We look forward to the Navy’s involvement in this development as it progresses.”<br>For more information contact Lieutenant Commander Maxine Lawes, RNZN, Advanced Training Officer, Officer Training School, Devonport, on 09 4455665, or Professor Claudia Scott, School of Government, Victoria University of Wellington on 04 463 5377.</p>
