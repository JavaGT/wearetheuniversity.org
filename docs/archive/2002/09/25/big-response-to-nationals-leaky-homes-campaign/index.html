<p>Big response to National’s leaky homes campaign</p>
<p>Wayne Mapp - National Housing Spokesperson</p>
<p>National has had a big response to its raising the issue of leaky homes and the launch of its website for people affected to write in submissions, says National Housing spokesperson Dr Wayne Mapp.</p>
<p>The website <a href="http://www.leakyhomes.co.nz">www.leakyhomes.co.nz</a> has had 2000 hits and National has received more than 60 submissions from more than a dozen centres throughout the country.</p>
<p>“Several hundred people have also asked us to keep them informed on any progress made to resolving the issue.</p>
<p>“It is clear leaky homes and faulty materials and workmanship are an issue throughout the country. There are hundreds of cases in the larger cities but we are also getting many owners affected in smaller centres like Whitianga, Pukekohe, Morrinsville, Wanganui and Gore.</p>
<p>“National is working on ways to achieve a fast track solution for home owners so that the problem can be fixed.</p>
<p>“Many people are heartbroken that they face thousands of dollars in legal and repair costs, their asset is devalued and their dream of a new home has fallen flat.</p>
<p>“We encourage all homeowners to make individual submissions, and those who are part of apartment and development blocks to also make joint submissions, to the select committee inquiry,” Dr Mapp said.</p>
