<p>PPTA Delegates Urged to Vote for Continuation of Sixth Form Certificate Next Year</p>
<p>Wednesday 25 Sep 2002 Donna Awatere Huata Press Releases -- Education</p>
<p>ACT education spokesman Donna Awatere Huata is urging PPTA delegates to vote against the implementation of Level 2 of the NCEA at their annual meeting tomorrow.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s important that delegates recognise the widespread concerns of parents, teachers and children when they cast their votes.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything but a vote in favour of the continuation of Sixth From Certificate will consign thousands of young people to the uncertainty of a valueless, meaningless qualification that rewards mediocrity.</p>
<p>&quot;The best option would be to scrap the NCEA completely and reinstate a system of nationwide external examinations that are of a high standard and internationally comparable.</p>
<p>&quot;Delegates at tomorrow&#39;s vote will have an opportunity to restore some certainty and confidence in the minds of parents and children - not to mention the teachers they represent - by voting against the continuation of the NCEA experiment next year.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope they won&#39;t squander that opportunity&quot;, Mrs Awatere Huata said.</p>
