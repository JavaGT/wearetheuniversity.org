<p>Nick Smith National Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>24 September 2002</p>
<p>National urges teachers to hold off NCEA</p>
<p>The Government must delay implementing the next round of the NCEA until the new qualification is working properly for fifth form students, said National&#39;s Education spokesperson, Nick Smith, at today&#39;s PPTA Conference.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand secondary education is facing a crisis of confidence from the bully tactics of the Education Minister. Trevor Mallard is making as big a mess of the NCEA as he made of the teachers&#39; pay dispute, and the losers, once again, are students.</p>
<p>&quot;It is ridiculous that with only one term left this year, there&#39;s still total confusion around the Government&#39;s policy on Level 2 of the NCEA.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a &#39;Clayton&#39;s choice&#39; to say schools can proceed with Level 2 when they know little about the alternative transitional Sixth Form Certificate, and the Minister has already called it inferior.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea floated that each school department would vote on whether Level 2 of the NCEA will proceed is chaotic and will leave students with a muddled and meaningless qualification.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has proved it is unable to show leadership on this issue, so National will. We propose:</p>
<p>* Sixth Form Certificate be retained for 2003 so problems with NCEA Level 1 can be addressed and resolved</p>
<p>* Work be completed urgently on the formula to generate Sixth Form Certificate grades from NCEA Level 1 exams</p>
<p>* NCEA Level 2 be piloted in a limited number of schools, on application, where the School Board and teachers support moving to NCEA at sixth form</p>
<p>&quot;The Education Minister&#39;s plan to bulldoze ahead with the NCEA is putting the new qualification in serious jeopardy. A measured, more consultative approach is what&#39;s needed to get the qualifications reform back on track,&quot; says Dr Smith.</p>
