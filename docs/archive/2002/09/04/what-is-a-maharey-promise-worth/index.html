<p>What Is A Maharey Promise Worth?</p>
<p>Tuesday 3 Sep 2002</p>
<p>Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey should explain how he could assure parliament that health contracts with Te Hauora o te Tai Tokerau Trust (THOTT) had been checked and were fine only days before the contracts worth almost $1 million were cancelled, ACT Associate Health Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Last week Mr Maharey assured Parliament that only CYF contracts with THOTT were under serious question and that &quot;having checked the health funding&quot; worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, there were no problems, and the money would continue to be paid.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet yesterday, the Northland District Health Board cancelled the contracts over growing concerns of serious financial mismanagement.</p>
<p>&quot;It is difficult to believe that the health contracts were in great shape just five days before being cancelled, and it calls into question whether the minister&#39;s statement in the House was based on robust advice, or whether it was cheap political grandstanding,&quot; Dr Newman asked.</p>
