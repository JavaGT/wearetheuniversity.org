<p>Experts to address Canterbury meeting on leaky homes</p>
<p>National is inviting Canterbury homeowners and others affected by leaky homes to hear local experts talk about the issue and find solutions to the problem, National MP David Carter said today.</p>
<p>National is holding a public meeting on the leaky homes issue in Christchurch this Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;Since launching our website we have had many Canterbury people contact us with their problems. Inquiries have come from rural areas as well as Christchurch,&quot; said Mr Carter.</p>
<p>Christchurch solicitor Hugh Matthews, building certifier Malcolm Davies, property surveyor Alan French, and Canterbury/Westland Real Estate Institute representative Peter Neylon will address the meeting on specific issues related to the problem of leaky houses.</p>
<p>National is determined to find a solution to these problems and is putting up fast track solutions so that homeowners can find a remedy.</p>
<p>Mr Carter said it was important for people to come to the meeting and have their say on the problems with leaky homes, and hear the speakers talk about what is causing the problems and the steps that can be taken to resolve it.</p>
<p>The meeting will be held at 2.30pm Sunday in the Oxford Terrace Baptist Church Hall, corner of Oxford Terrace and Madras Street next to the fire station.</p>
<p>Ends</p>
