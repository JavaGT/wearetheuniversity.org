<p>Strategic Partnership Agreement Signed Between the University of Canterbury and Industry New Zealand</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury is set to play a more active role in regional and national economic and business development as the result of a strategic partnership being signed with Industry New Zealand today.</p>
<p>The partnership agreement outlines how the University and Industry New Zealand will work together on economic development initiatives, support for businesses, and projects such as the recently-launched Human Interface Technology Laboratory of New Zealand.</p>
<p>The University wants to develop strong links with industry and broaden its research focus with increasing emphasis on applied research with commercial potential. It is also keen to play a role in regional leadership.</p>
<p>Industry New Zealand General Manager Southern Region Paul Claridge says Industry New Zealand sees the tertiary sector as enormously important if New Zealand&#39;s economic performance is to be improved.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first strategic partnership Industry New Zealand has signed with a university, and I am sure it won&#39;t be the last.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of the children starting primary school today will work in industries that haven&#39;t been conceived yet. And some of our top companies in ten years time haven&#39;t been started yet.</p>
<p>&quot;Those are hugely exciting challenges for us all. This strategic partnership will help Canterbury University build relationships with industry, and be more finely attuned to emerging business trends and developments.</p>

<p>&quot;It will be a powerful driver for commercialisation of applied research occurring within the University.</p>
<p>&quot;And if Industry New Zealand is serious about supporting our high growth potential businesses and propelling them into global markets, then we have to play a bigger role in guiding skills and talent development.&quot;</p>
<p>The Tertiary Education Commission and Industry New Zealand have also begun working closely together to secure better alignment between education and industry, Mr Claridge said.</p>
<p>Professor John Raine, the University&#39;s Pro Vice-Chancellor (International), welcomed the relationship with Industry New Zealand warmly and said it would be of key importance to the University.</p>
<p>&quot;The University has developed a close working relationship with Industry New Zealand on initiatives to build industry-linked research capability. We&#39;ve been assisted by Canterbury Development Corporation and all three parties are cooperating on projects that are aimed at promoting regional economic development.</p>
<p>&quot;The Human Interface Technology Laboratory of New Zealand (HIT Lab NZ) and the proposed e-Security Lab are two very good examples. Both of these ventures will create new technology and will involve close collaboration with industry.&quot;</p>
<p>Examples of the strategic partnership working in action in addition to the HIT Lab NZ and e-Security laboratory, include establishing an internship programme allowing business students to work in local industry, collaboration between Industry New Zealand&#39;s Business Development Advisors and the University&#39;s commercialising arm, Canterprise, and linking the University with Industry New Zealand&#39;s sector research and strategies.</p>
<p>The signing ceremony is taking place at: Time: 8.30am Date: Friday 20 September 2002 Venue: University of Canterbury Registry, Vice-Chancellor&#39;s Office,  </p>
