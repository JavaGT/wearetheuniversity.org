<p>Bailey Junior was Hidden by Education Minister</p>
<p>Tuesday 17 Sep 2002 Donna Awatere Huata Press Releases -- Education</p>
<p>ACT Education Spokesman Donna Awatere Huata today reiterated her call for the Government to allow the development of high-quality alternative education providers.</p>
<p>&quot;Bailey Junior Kurariki, the youngest youth convicted for his part in the killing of Michael Choy, didn&#39;t attend school for two years before the murder. Trevor Mallard justifies this by saying that Bailey was in Correspondence School.</p>
<p>&quot;That is a cop out. The Correspondence School is designed to cater for children from far-flung rural areas. It is not designed to carry the overload of children with massive behavioural problems that no other school can deal with.</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard and the Secretary of Education have actively encouraged schools that can&#39;t cope with children to put those kids in Correspondence. Both this Government and the previous National Government have used the Correspondence system to hide long-term truants and school drop outs. That&#39;s immoral.</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard believes every child should fit into state schools, and if kids create too much trouble, he hides them away in Correspondence School.</p>
<p>&quot;On paper, these kids are being educated. In reality, they have licence to roam the streets committing crime.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard closed down Auckland&#39;s Metropolitan College, but hasn&#39;t allowed any new, alternative providers to create opportunities for at-risk children, anywhere in the country.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr Mallard&#39;s ideological opposition to choice in education is a fundamental problem. We must address rocketing youth crime. We cannot do so until we stop hiding our school system&#39;s `failures&#39; in the Correspondence system,&quot; Mrs Awatere Huata said.</p>
