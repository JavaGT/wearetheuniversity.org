<p>Labour Pushes Vulnerable Into Welfare Trap</p>
<p>Friday 6 Sep 2002</p>
<p>The Labour Government has failed to help the most vulnerable members of society - mothers and their children - to escape the trap of welfare dependency, ACT Social Welfare Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Answers from my parliamentary questions reveal that 109,233 New Zealanders receive the domestic purposes benefit - almost the exact same number as last year. It shows that welfare dependency has become completely entrenched at an unacceptably high level among sole parents and their children.</p>
<p>&quot;At a time when the Government&#39;s own research is classifying the domestic purposes benefit as a risk factor to children, legislation which will increase dependency on the DPB is being debated in parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;The Social Security (Working Towards Employment) Amendment Bill essentially removes work testing of the DPB. That means thousands more people will be encouraged by Labour to depend entirely on taxpayers.</p>
<p>&quot;New statistics from the United States show that welfare rolls fell 5.6 percent in 2001. Much of that success is attributed to stronger work test requirements.</p>
<p>&quot;While our Government is busy removing the work test on benefits, the rest of the world is strengthening theirs.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT believes it is not morally responsible to support the softening of the DPB when it will undermine marriage and the family, and damage children. That is why we support a tough love approach which would provide child care support at the same time as strengthening work test requirements to give sole parents a hand up to a good job, more money and a better life,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
