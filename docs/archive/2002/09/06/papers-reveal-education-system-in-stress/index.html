<p>Papers Reveal Education System In &quot;Stress&quot;</p>
<p>Friday 6 Sep 2002</p>
<p>Briefing papers for the Education Minister bluntly reveal he has run down the schooling system after three years in office, ACT Education Spokesman Donna Awatere Huata said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s briefing papers are refreshingly honest - although it would be difficult to hide the fact that our education system is in serious trouble, and has been degraded since Mr Mallard was appointed.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry has used this briefing paper to tell the Minister, in an indictment on his time in office, that the &quot;schooling system [is] showing signs of stress and fatigue&quot;. It candidly states that &quot;knowledge diffusion and technology transfer are not happening on a scale that will make New Zealand&#39;s innovation system thrive&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry warns Mr Mallard of &quot;high levels of disparity&quot; in all levels of participation and achievement. Mr Mallard is told &quot;there are still students causing concern, particularly in low decile schools&quot;, and that increasingly &quot;some students are being left behind&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister is also alerted to the fact that &quot;early leaving exemptions from secondary school have been rising significantly&quot; since he came to office - these exemptions are one dishonest way that this Government lifts &quot;overall&quot; performance, by giving difficult students a certificate exempting them from school.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry warns of more wage disputes - &quot;wage pressures will be a key issue&quot; - and recommends allowing &quot;opportunities for excellent teachers to progress up the pay scale more rapidly&quot;. This advice will not be met with enthusiasm from the Minister, who refuses to even debate dumping the antiquated, centralised, one size fits all pay system.</p>
<p>&quot;This document shows the schooling system is in big trouble, and the Ministry itself is not faring much better - the &quot;Ministry is working with poor financial information, systems and processes&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I am delighted that the Ministry of Education has been honest enough to alert Trevor Mallard to the real issues. Sadly, I have no faith that this jaded Minister will pay heed to the warnings, or implement a single measure to refresh our &quot;tired&quot; and &quot;fatigued&quot; system,&quot; Mrs Awatere Huata said.</p>
