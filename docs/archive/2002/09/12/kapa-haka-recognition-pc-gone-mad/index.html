<p>Kapa Haka recognition political correctness gone mad</p>
<p>Dr Nick Smith - National Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>Recognising Kapa Haka in the NCEA is further evidence that the Government’s new school qualification is becoming a joke, says National’s Education spokesperson Dr Nick Smith.</p>
<p>“That a student can get over 24 out of 80 points for level one NCEA from participating in a school’s Kapa Haka group is political correctness gone mad. This is a cynical exercise in getting more students a qualification at school not by improving their education but by lowering students.</p>
<p>“Kapa Haka is like school choirs, sports teams and school productions. These activities have long been acknowledged at school in reports and references but it is a nonsense to include them as part of a formal qualification.</p>
<p>“This nonsense of creating qualifications for Kapa Haka, travel, outdoor pursuits and Maori song is dumbing down academic achievement in our schools.</p>
<p>“Academic excellence and not political correctness must be the driver for our system of school qualifications,” said Dr Smith.  </p>
