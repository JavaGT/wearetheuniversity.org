<p><strong>Knowledge Wave Not Even A Ripple</strong></p>
<p>Rodney Hide -- Speech Notes: Self-Medication Industry Association Biannual Meeting -- Hotel Du Vin, 11am 9 September 2002</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s much-vaunted &quot;Knowledge Wave&quot; launched with much fanfare has proved not even a ripple on the marketplace.</p>
<p>The reason is simple enough. The Government&#39;s &quot;hands on partnership&quot; approach to the economy is at loggerheads with making use of the knowledge that entrepreneurs have in their heads.</p>
<p>Present Government policy provides neither the freedom nor the incentive for entrepreneurs to capitalise on their knowledge in a fast-shifting economic world.</p>
<p>Put aside the rhetoric, and the Government&#39;s approach to the &quot;Knowledge Wave&quot; is one of laborious committee, government reports and government say-so. The Government&#39;s failure is to believe that it can concentrate all the knowledge and entrepreneurial insight into the centre with Jim Anderton sitting atop it all like some economic potentate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the real world, real wealth creators battle punishing tax rates, crushing red tape, and government officials who have no conception of what it is to have to turn a dollar.</p>
<p>The &quot;Knowledge Wave&quot; is now a sick and empty political joke.</p>
<p>The way to ride the &quot;Knowledge Wave&quot; is to have real economic policy - not warmed-over 1970s University Socialism.</p>
<p>Real economic policy means two things: economic freedom and incentive.</p>
<p>We need again to reaffirm the importance of private property rights - not rules and regulations about what we can and can&#39;t do - and we need the incentive of keeping more of what we earn through less government spending and tax cuts.</p>
<p>Our demand should be for a Government that does a little but does it well. We can find our own business partners, thank you. We don&#39;t need Jim Anderton busting his way in. Government could start by concentrating on just two things: keeping our homes and our streets safe, and roads.  </p>
