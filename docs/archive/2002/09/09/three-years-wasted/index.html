<p>Georgina te Heuheu</p>
<p>National Spokesperson for Maori Affairs</p>
<p>6 September 2002</p>
<p>Three years wasted</p>
<p>Opposition Spokesperson for Maori Affairs, Georgina te Heuheu expressed disbelief today at the statement of the Minister of Maori Affairs Parekura Horomia that Maori Television was &quot;complex&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell us something new,&quot; Mrs te Heuheu said. &quot;If it has taken the Minister this long to figure out that Maori Television is complex, it&#39;s no wonder we are no further ahead than where we were three years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;In the House this week I questioned where the Maori leadership was in the Government, and asked the Minister to show leadership for Maori,&quot; Mrs te Heuheu said.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders need to feel confident that this Minister is capable of<br>coming up with solutions to complex issues. That is his job. If the best he can do is to state the obvious, and say it&#39;s complex, then he is part of the problem not part of the solution.</p>
<p>&quot;So far hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent, with little result. That is the legacy of this Minister&#39;s first term in office. He needs to show leadership, and show that he has solutions. Otherwise he should step aside and let John Tamihere have a go&quot;, Mrs te Heuheu said.</p>
