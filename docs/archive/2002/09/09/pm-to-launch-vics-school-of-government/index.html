<p>New Zealand’s State Sector is to get a boost with the establishment of Victoria University’s new School of Government.<br>The School, to be launched by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Helen Clark, tomorrow (Tuesday September 10), brings together under one umbrella the Institute of Policy Studies, the Health Services Research Centre, the Centre for Strategic Studies, Victoria-Police Education programme, the Public Management Master’s programme and the undergraduate, honours and Masters programmes in Public Policy.<br>Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon said the new School was a continuation of Victoria University’s commitment to improving the professionalism of the State Sector and providing it with independent and high-quality research and advice.<br>“The State Sector impacts on the lives of all New Zealanders and the public rightly demands that the people providing the Government with advice on key policy issues are well-educated and well-informed. To that end, the School of Government will be an independent, internationally respected centre for learning, research and professional development in public sector issues and management and builds on Victoria University’s more than 60 years’ involvement in the education of public servants.”<br>Professor McCutcheon said the School would further develop its networks and partnerships with central, regional and local government, Crown entities, State-owned enterprises, the private sector, unions, iwi and Maori organisations, governments internationally as well other academic institutions in New Zealand and overseas.<br>The School is located in downtown Wellington at Rutherford House, within a short distance of the three branches of New Zealand’s democracy: the Executive, Parliament and the Judiciary. “This location is critical to the School’s role as the ‘primary gateway’ for Government into the University and other universities in New Zealand and overseas,” he said.<br>“The School is designed to be a ‘one-stop-shop’ that will provide access to all the relevant expertise which the public sector needs, either directly through the School’s own resources or by calling upon those with specialist knowledge and skills within the University and elsewhere.”<br>The launch of the School will also see Helen Clark present several awards. The Prime Minister’s Prize in Public Policy will be awarded to Dr Peter Roberts while Inspector Chris Salt, from the New Zealand Police, will receive the Prime Minister’s Prize in Public Management. Dr Roberts will also be presented with the Holmes Prize for the best piece of research in either the Master of Public Policy or Master of Public Management programmes by noted economist, Victoria alumnus, company director and public servant, Sir Frank Holmes.<br>Media are invited to the launch from 6pm for 6.30pm start, Tuesday 10 September in the Rutherford House foyer, Bunny Street, Wellington<br>Issued by Victoria University of Wellington Public Affairs<br>For further information please contact <a href="mailto:Antony.Paltridge@vuw.ac.nz">Antony.Paltridge@vuw.ac.nz</a> or phone +64-4-463-5873</p>
