<p>Simon Power</p>
<p>National Tertiary Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>6th September 2002</p>
<p>Briefing papers show big issues for tertiary education</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s reforms to tertiary education have caused serious damage to both students and institutes, and particularly Maori, says National&#39;s Tertiary Education spokesperson Simon Power.</p>
<p>&quot;Education briefing papers released today say that half of the public tertiary institutions are not generating enough surplus &quot;even to maintain long term viability&quot;. Labour&#39;s fee freeze has put a financial straitjacket on universities, and this is the result.</p>
<p>&quot;The large increase in students studying at private providers shows the folly of cutting their funding. The report says that &quot;traditional pathways into tertiary education are changing&quot; and that &quot;learners are increasingly choosing private providers&quot;. 19% of all students are now studying with private providers.</p>
<p>&quot;The capped funding for Private Training Establishments has hurt Maori most of all. The report notes that &quot;growth in Maori participation is now concentrated in private providers and wananga&quot; and that wananga now cover 4.5% of all students. So much for closing the gaps.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures show that high-level tertiary education is still not a priority for the Government. Vocational education and PhD graduation rates are still well below the OECD average.</p>
<p>&quot;The report also outlines concerns over quality assurance, goals for the sector that are &quot;less clear&quot;, and say that &quot;risks associated with change are likely to be unusually high&quot;. These are some serious issues for Steve Maharey to deal with, and National will be monitoring the Ministers every move in this area,&quot; said Mr Power.</p>
