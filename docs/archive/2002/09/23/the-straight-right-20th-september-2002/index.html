<h3>The Straight Right</h3>
<p><em>From the Desk of Bill English - 20th September</em>  </p>
<p>Welcome to the first edition of The Straight Right. Plain English has had a name change, and a change of style. Let us know what you think – email <a href="mailto:feedback@national.org.nz">feedback@national.org.nz</a> with any comments or suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Standing alongside our allies</strong></p>
<p>It seems that Labour’s very very very good friendship with the US has lasted for only a very very very short time.</p>
<p>Helen Clark was a strident critic of the Bush administration yet now she is rushing to assist the weapon inspectors, who are there only because of the US threats. They’re trying to have it both ways on this issue, and it’s making us even more irrelevant on the world stage.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein didn’t change his mind on weapons inspection because some left-wing think tank at the UN passed a resolution. He changed his mind because the US were threatening force, and he knew President Bush wasn’t bluffing.</p>
<p>What’s more, it’s a disgrace that the Government didn’t want to debate the issue in Parliament. National Leader Bill English had to force a special debate to allow all viewpoints to be heard.</p>
<p>Labour managed to keep up the act of supporting the US until the election, but we’re seeing their true colours now. For the trendy politically correct in Labour and the Greens it has always been fashionable to hate America.</p>
<p>So what’s National’s position? We support our traditional allies - Britain, Australia and the US, and we want to influence their decisions. This is the best way to get our point of view across, rather than relying on the UN, a body that Saddam Hussein has completely ignored.</p>

<p><strong>The Week In Politics…</strong></p>
<p>*Pressure from National has forced the Government into a u-turn over the leaky building issue, with a Select Committee now investigating the issue. It’s still not good enough though. The terms of reference are too narrow, and it’s avoiding the tough questions that homeowners want answered, like who is going to pay for repairs, and when will they happen.</p>
<p>*Because of the huge public concern over this issue, National MPs are holding a public meeting in Auckland this Sunday, 2:30pm at the Horse and Trap, 3 Enfield Street Mt Eden. They’re concerned, and they want to hear your concerns about what’s happening.</p>
<p>*It seems that United Future MP Bernie Ogilvy is not the only MP to be caught out over a Clayton’s doctorate. Apparently Helen Clark is often referred to overseas as ‘Dr Clark,’ thanks to confusing information on the Labour Party website. It doesn’t paint a flattering picture, given that she castigated Mr Ogilvy earlier in the week.</p>
<p>*Helen Clark is back to her old ways – she refused to go head-to-head with Bill English on Morning Report this morning, over the issue of Iraq.</p>
<p>*National MP Phil Heatley has riled up Green MP Nandor Tanczos by questioning the trial of hemp plants, which he says is a sneaky way of legalising cannabis through the back door. Ironically, Tanczos admitted that the hemp may not even be GE – free.</p>
<p>*Bill English attended the official American commemorations of September 11th last week in Auckland, a move appreciated by the Americans, especially since he was the only politician who showed up.</p>
<p>*If you are in Auckland this Friday check out the Parliamentarians vs Musicians rugby game at Eden Park, as a curtain raiser to the Auckland vs Canterbury NPC game. National Leader Bill ‘Bruiser’ English is in the team again, playing openside flanker.</p>
<p>*Congratulations to National MP Katherine Rich, who gave birth to baby Georgia this week. Georgia was born at Queen Mary Maternity hospital, and is a sister for Jonathan, Daniel and Emma. Mum, Dad and baby are all happy and doing well.</p>
