<p>Action needed on building crisis – and now</p>
<p>Wayne Mapp - National Housing Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Select Committee inquiry into the leaky building crisis must be widened and a fast track dispute resolution process put in place now, says National’s Housing spokesman, Wayne Mapp.</p>
<p>“Homeowners caught up in this disaster cannot afford to wade through a lengthy and expensive legal process. They want action, not talk, and the Government should move now to establish a speedy alternative dispute resolution process.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister and Internal Affairs Minister have both tried to brush off the problem by suggesting people sue through the courts. All this will do is cost homeowners thousands and clog up the courts system.</p>
<p>“People want solutions, and fast. The Select Committee inquiry must be widened beyond building code issues and certification, to deal with liability, accountability, health issues and the dispute resolution process.</p>
<p>“Today, I have written to the Chair of the Government Administration Select Committee, proposing the terms of reference for the inquiry be expanded. A full inquiry is the only way confidence in the country’s building industry will be restored.”</p>
<p>National is urging homeowners to make submissions for a wider inquiry. Submissions forms can be obtained at http:// <a href="http://www.leakyhomes.co.nz">http://www.leakyhomes.co.nz</a>.</p>
<p>“It is totally unacceptable that people have to live in leaky, unhealthy houses they don’t want, and can’t sell. They need to make submissions covering all aspects of the problems they are facing,” says Dr Mapp.  </p>
