<p>Wellington meeting on leaky homes</p>
<p>National is holding a public meeting in Wellington on the leaky building crisis this Wednesday.</p>
<p>National MP Roger Sowry said it was clear that leaky homes were a problem in many Wellington apartment blocks, and in homes around the area.</p>
<p>&quot;Homeowners from suburbs throughout the Wellington region are affected. Many have contacted us through our website with their concerns about how they can get some resolution to save their home and investment.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people have turned out to public meeting organised by National in Auckland and Christchurch over the past 10 days.</p>
<p>&quot;This will be an opportunity for Wellington people affected to have their say and hear experts speak in various fields related to the issue.</p>
<p>National Housing Spokesperson Dr Wayne Mapp said the Government was distancing itself from the issue, simply telling people affected to seek legal advice.</p>
<p>National will move a motion in Parliament tomorrow for its proposed Weathertightness Tribunal to be set up under the Construction Contracts Bill 2001. &quot;This is the most cost effective, informal and quickest way to get this issue resolved for the thousands of people affected,&quot; Dr Mapp said.</p>
<p>The Wellington meeting is at 12.30pm Wednesday September 2 in the Loaves and Fishes meeting room, behind the Anglican Cathedral - Hill St entrance.</p>
<p>Ends</p>
