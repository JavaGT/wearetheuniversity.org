<p>Christchurch public meeting demands solutions to leaky homes</p>
<p>Dr Wayne Mapp - National Housing Spokesperson and David Carter National MP</p>
<p>A well-attended public meeting on leaky home syndrome in Christchurch today was keen to find fast-track solutions to the leaky homes disaster.</p>
<p>More than 100 people attended the meeting, organised by the National Party and chaired by Canterbury MP David Carter. Speakers spoke on the legal, building certification, surveying and real estate issues around leaky homes.<br>National Housing spokesman Dr Wayne Mapp said the meeting showed that leaky homes is a national problem which has been totally underestimated.</p>
<p>“The Government has been caught short on this issue and is coming under real pressure to come up with solutions. We hope it doesn’t make hasty decisions simply to cover its lack of action.</p>
<p>“The Cabinet meeting tomorrow needs to take positive action. We expect to see something out of Cabinet that will take the responsibility from George Hawkins because he has handled this issue very poorly.</p>
<p>National will move a motion in Parliament this week for its proposed Weathertightness Tribunal to be set up under the Construction Contracts Bill 2001. “This is the most cost effective, informal and quickest way to get this issue resolved for the thousands of people affected,” Dr Mapp said.</p>
<p>National Local Government spokesman Gerry Brownlee and Auckland MP Pansy Wong also attended the meeting.</p>
<p>National is urging leaky homeowners to make submissions for a much wider select committee inquiry. Submission forms and latest news on the issue are on National’s website <a href="http://www.leakyhomes.co.nz">http://www.leakyhomes.co.nz</a>  </p>
