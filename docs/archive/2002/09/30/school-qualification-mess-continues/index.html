<p>School Qualification mess continues</p>
<p>Nick Smith - National Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Minister of Education seems more interested in placating teachers than in delivering a robust qualification for Sixth Form students next year, says National’s Education spokesman Nick Smith.</p>
<p>“The Minister should not abrogate responsibility for what school qualifications are offered onto teachers without input from Boards, principals and students. It might suit teachers in different departments to offer different qualifications, but for students to do some subjects NCEA and others Sixth Form Certificate is an awful muddle.</p>
<p>“The reform of our school qualifications is turning into a joke of Faulty Towers proportions that would be hilarious were it not so serious.</p>
<p>“The transitional 6th form certificate for next year will lack credibility with Mr Mallard’s decision to let each school decide the grades for its students. Add to this each school department deciding on whether NCEA or 6th form certificate will be offered and the end product will be both confusing and worthless.</p>
<p>“If the Minister had got his act together earlier in the year when it was obvious level 2 NCEA could not be fully implemented next year, a proper mechanism for generating 6th form grades could have been developed.</p>
<p>“Responsibility for this mess rests clearly with Mr Mallard who continues to ignore principals, boards, parents, students and teachers legitimate concerns about the NCEA,” said Dr Smith.  </p>
