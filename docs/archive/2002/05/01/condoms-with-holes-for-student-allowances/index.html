<p>Joint Media Statement of: Otago University Students Association and<br>Otago Polytechnic Students Association</p>
<p>Students to give out Condoms with Holes for Student Allowances</p>
<p>01/05/2002, For Immediate Release<br>Attn: Education Reporters</p>
<p>T omorrow Otago students will distribute around campus condoms with large holes in them, which will enable hundreds, perhaps thousands of students to receive a student allowance. The condoms have been shown by extensive testing to provide the best chances of getting a student allowance, after a delay of nine months.</p>
<p>“It’s one of the bizarre peculiarities of the student allowance scheme that getting having a child, all of a sudden makes you more worthy of student support than every other student. Apparently parents are more likely to contribute to the knowledge economy or something. Every student deserves support from the government.” said Otago University Students Association Campaign Coordinator Kyle Matthews.</p>
<p>The condoms, with simple instructions, will be distributed around the Otago University and Otago Polytechnic campuses at lunchtime tomorrow, as part of a campaign to get an allowance for all full time students in the 2002 elections.</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t have to be out saying, ‘here, you can get an allowance by marrying, by having children’. We should be out saying ‘as a student you are going to contribute to the economy and the future of our country, so the country will support you while you learn to do that’. Education is an investment to be made, not a cost to be reduced.” said Otago Polytechnic Students Association Vice-President Michelle Watt.</p>
<p>[Students will be at the Polytechnic Students Centre at 12, the University Union at 1]</p>
