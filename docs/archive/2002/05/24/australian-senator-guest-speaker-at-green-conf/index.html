<p>Australian Senator guest speaker at Green conference</p>
<p>The youngest person in the Australian Federal Parliament will arrive in New Zealand on Sunday as the keynote speaker at the Green Conference during Queen&#39;s Birthday Weekend.</p>
<p>Senator Kerry Nettle will be the new Green Senator for New South Wales in the Australian Federal Upper House. She was elected as a Green candidate in October last year, aged 27 years old.</p>
<p>Kerry will address the Green Conference on Friday 31 May at the Auckland University Marae at 8pm.</p>
<p>&quot;We are delighted to have Kerry speak at our conference. She will be a timely reminder of the difference young people can make in politics and a real inspiration to our own young Green candidates,&quot; said Green co-leader Rod Donald.</p>
<p>&quot;Kerry represents a new generation of politicians and a new style of politics desperately needed to tackle the problems facing the planet.&quot;</p>
<p>Kerry has a strong campaigning background and will bring an experienced, strong youth voice to the Australian Senate. In 2000 Kerry lived and worked in East Timor teaching English and computer skills to women on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>Kerry has worked as a youth worker in Western Sydney and is currently working with Justice Action on prisoners rights. She has also worked as a media spokesperson at the Jabiluka Uranium Mine blockade in Kakadu National Park.</p>
<p>In the buildup to conference Kerry will be attending events in Christchurch and Wellington. Kerry will be available for media interviews. She will be in Christchurch on Monday, Wellington on Tuesday and Wednesday and Auckland on Thursday and Friday.</p>
