<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>23 May 2002<br>For immediate release</p>
<p>Semi-regulation of student fees a semi-good idea</p>
<p>The semi-regulation of university fee setting, which has been announced by the Government in today’s budget, has met with a generally positive response from student leaders.</p>
<p>The President of the Otago University Students’ Association, Roz Connelly is excited by the announcement, as she believes it will give greater certainty to students. “Students’ associations have been calling for fee regulation for a decade” said Ms Connelly. “Currently, there is no security for students worried about fee levels from year to year and the fee freeze funding negotiations, have been time-consuming and haven’t achieved much.”</p>
<p>The supplementary order paper, which is entitled ‘Excellence, relevance and access’, was released today alongside the budget. It will see funding rates set three years in advance and set fee maximums set for different subject types and levels. Ms Connelly stresses that “the new regulations will be of no benefit to students if they do not lead to decreasing fees”.</p>
<p>Ms Connelly also adds that regulating fees puts the onus back on the government to lower the cost of tertiary study. “For years the battle for lower fees has been fought against the institution, when the real responsibility has lain with the Government. These reforms place the accountability squarely on the shoulders of the Minister.”</p>
