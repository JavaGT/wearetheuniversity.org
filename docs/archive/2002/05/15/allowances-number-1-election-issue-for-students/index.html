<p><strong>Wednesday, 15 May 2002, 11:40 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) launched its nation-wide campaign today calling on the government to introduce a universal student allowance and warned if it ignores this issue it will get a bumpy ride to the polls from students.</p>
<p>“The one big thing that all political parties can do to help alleviate student debt this election is to back a universal living allowance for all full time students,” said NZUSA Co-President Andrew Campbell.</p>
<p>“The government is currently reviewing student support systems. We encourage them to use that process to move towards a universal allowance. Universal allowances should be considered as a serious option in this review,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“The current allowances scheme is inherently flawed. Since it was introduced in 1992 the percentage of students receiving an allowance has decreased from 45% to 33%. This is because the parental income thresholds for means testing have never been adjusted for inflation,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“The average bachelors graduate will leave tertiary study with a $20,000 loan. Total student debt is now over $5 billion and some students will take most of their working lives to repay their debts, and 80% of people surveyed by Colmar Brunton believe that there should be universal allowances. Now is the time for action,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“Students and their families want to see for a commitment from all parties to increase access to allowances. The student debt crisis will not go away until the causes of debt are tackled head on,” said Campbell</p>
