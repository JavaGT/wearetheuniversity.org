<p>Serious Questions Raised Over Spending On Prison Consultants</p>
<p>Corrections Minister Matt Robson must answer questions on the spending of $500,000 on consultation for the proposed Meremere prison, says Port Waikato MP Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;Money has been been paid to a convicted fraudster, a recently liquidated Trust, and now a $245,000 contract being paid monthly in advance.</p>
<p>&quot;The Department of Corrections has already paid $150,000 to eight members of the Ngati Naho Incorporated Society. Yet the Trust of the same name was recently liquidated. The members created a new body, with the same name, which now represents the individuals rather than the five marae.</p>
<p>&quot;Today in Parliament Matt Robson was asked if he could guarantee that the $245,000 annual contract offered to Tainui, to be paid monthly in advance for consultation, would be spent wisely. He must justify his answer that it would be.&quot;</p>
<p>The Department also hired a convicted fraudster as a consultant. &quot;The Minister has denied mistakes were made in hiring Tommy Moana as a consultant for the prison, given his recent conviction on 53 counts of fraud.</p>
<p>&quot;The processes being used by Matt Robson are shrouded in secrecy and appear to be full of inconsistencies. The Minister has some serious explaining to do,&quot; said Dr Hutchison.</p>
