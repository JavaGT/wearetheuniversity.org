<p><strong>Thursday, 2 May 2002, 10:52 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>2 May 2002</p>
<p>Former National Party President and Wellington businesswoman Sue Wood is to put her name forward for the National Party list for the next election.</p>
<p>Sue Wood says that in recent months, she has become convinced that the prospects for New Zealand under Labour are grim while friends and colleagues have convinced her to put her name forward to be part of making a difference.</p>
<p>“New Zealand can do better, New Zealand has to do better, and New Zealanders know it. We cannot afford to be complacent about our lot as New Zealanders. We are small, isolated and heavily reliant on sound government decision-making. We’re too small to be able to afford to make mistakes.</p>
<p>“We do not have an economy that can sustain First World living standards or First World social services over time, and despite being presented with opportunities such as the Knowledge Wave initiative, Labour has shown no inclination to act,” Sue Wood said.</p>
<p>“Labour knows how to exercise power for short-term gain but it is not providing the good government New Zealand desperately needs to reverse our long-term economic slide.”</p>
<p>“There is no such thing as safe politics. You can’t keep everyone happy and poll every week to make sure you’re not upsetting anyone. In the end you’ll let people down. I’ve seen how that works before and it is starting to happen again.”</p>
<p>Sue Wood served her political apprenticeship during the 1970s and ‘80s and since then has been involved internationally in democracy-building programmes, has built a successful business and served on a number of boards and trusts.</p>

<p>“My candidacy is an opportunity to share my experiences, contribute to good government and support the National Party every inch of the way during this tight and volatile campaign. It is good for National that Labour is overly-confident and good that we are underestimated by the media.</p>
<p>“New Zealand can do better and I’m going to give this my best shot.”</p>
