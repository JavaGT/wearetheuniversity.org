<p>Rewarding Success With Relevant, Reliable School Qualifications</p>
<p>A robust system of school qualifications is needed to raise the educational standards that every young New Zealander deserves, says National Party Leader Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we are announcing our School Qualifications Policy, recognising that students will achieve their very best in an environment where success is properly acknowledged and rewarded.</p>
<p>&quot;The current rewards for Bursary exam success are a joke and need revising. The recent Government exam fees hike means that a student now pays $185 to sit, yet receives only $100 for a B Bursary and $200 for an A Bursary.</p>
<p>&quot;This is no incentive. We want to encourage excellence so we intend to increase the value of the Bursary qualification for this, and future years&#39; candidates, with a payment of $2000 for an A Bursary and $1000 for a B Bursary.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s reform of school qualifications in the 1990&#39;s has been seriously undermined by the Government. The NCEA is in trouble, with doubt existing that students doing Level 1 at Year 11 (5th Form) will even get a qualification this year.</p>
<p>&quot;National believes NCEA can work if modified and properly resourced. A National Government will review the new qualification to ensure it increases the use of external examinations, reports achievement standards with percentage marks, records both students&#39; success and failure, and addresses teacher workloads.</p>
<p>&quot;National will only proceed with implementing NCEA to Level 2, Year 12 in 2003 if the NZQA has successfully implemented Level 1 and the secondary teachers&#39; collective employment contract has been settled. Similarly, the NCEA at Year 13 will only proceed with the confidence and full support of everyone involved.</p>
<p>&quot;Our school qualifications system must be relevant and reliable. Employers, tertiary institutions, parents and students expect it, and National will deliver it,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
