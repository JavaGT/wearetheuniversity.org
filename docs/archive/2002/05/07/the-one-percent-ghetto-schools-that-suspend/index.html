<p><strong>Tuesday, 7 May 2002, 11:06 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Tuesday 7 May 2002</p>
<p>One percent of secondary schools were responsible for nineteen percent of suspensions in 2001, ACT Education Spokesman MP Donna Awatere Huata revealed today.</p>
<p>&quot;Twenty-seven schools account for 920 suspensions, or 34 each. That is almost forty classrooms of children.</p>
<p>&quot;Zoning has created ghetto schools that are rampant with violence, drug offending, sexual harassment and intimidation. At these over-burdened schools, teachers are kicking children out because they don&#39;t have the resources or skills to cope.</p>
<p>&quot;In comparison, fourteen percent of schools didn&#39;t suspend a single child, and a further twenty-two percent made fewer than five suspensions.</p>
<p>&quot;There were 17,141 stand-downs and 4,802 suspensions last year - 113 stand-downs or suspensions every single school day.</p>
<p>&quot;Drugs and substance abuse was the most frequent reason for suspension (1,555 cases representing 32 percent of suspensions) , followed by continual disobedience (1,126 representing 23 percent) and physical assault on other children (685, representing 14 percent). It is frightening that 358 of our most vulnerable children - from primary schools and special schools - got into strife for drugs offences. That&#39;s more than the number who faced disciplinary action for smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard spent $1.05 million on a Suspension Reduction Initiative for Maori students in the past year - that would appear to have worked in the areas it was implemented, yet it doesn&#39;t address the real problem. Suspensions in decile one-to-three schools haven&#39;t dropped at all, and boys, Maori and Pacific Island children are still over-represented.</p>
<p>&quot;Our most urgent concern must be identifying the 27 schools that each suspended a classroom full of children. Packages to reduce suspension rates for particular groups of New Zealanders are meaningless when a core group of schools is so under-resourced that they have no other option,&quot; Mrs Awatere Huata said.</p>
