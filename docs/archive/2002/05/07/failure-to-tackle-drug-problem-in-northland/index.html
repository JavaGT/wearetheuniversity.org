<p>Government Fails To Tackle Drug Problem In Northland Schools</p>
<p>Tuesday 7 May 2002</p>
<p>The Government has failed to reduce the number of suspensions for children in Northland, ACT Education Spokesman MP Donna Awatere Huata revealed today.</p>
<p>&quot;The rate of children being caught with drugs in Northland schools has remained static - and the highest in the country - since Trevor Mallard became Education Minister. And the overall rate of suspension hasn&#39;t dropped at all.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sick of politicians arguing that we should let some kids get away with more because of the area they come from. That&#39;s the same as saying we should give some children less education because their parents happen to be poor.</p>
<p>&quot;Northland schools suspended 1,310 children last year - that&#39;s 14 children per every thousand students, more than double the national average of just 6 kids per 1,000.</p>
<p>&quot;One hundred and sixty-six children were suspended for drug offences. The Northland rate of suspension for drug problems is triple the national average.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is trumpeting reduced suspension numbers for Gisborne. They have focussed on that area to the detriment of Northland, which is facing serious problems.</p>
<p>&quot;Northland&#39;s kids aren&#39;t any naughtier than any other children in the country. Their over-burdened teachers deserve more support from the Minister, and we need a comprehensive campaign if we are to reduce the problems in Northland&#39;s schools,&quot; Mrs Awatere Huata said.</p>
