<p><strong>Thursday, 30 May 2002, 2:43 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Green Party launches its pre-election conference in Auckland tomorrow afternoon with a record number of members attending.</p>
<p>Over 230 Green Party members and a large media contingent will meet on the Waipapa Marae at Auckland University. The AGM will begin with a powhiri at 5pm.</p>
<p>Twenty eight-year-old Australian Green Senator Kerry Nettle will give the keynote speech on Friday night at 8pm. Copies will be released closer to the time.</p>
<p>Green co-leaders Jeanette Fitzsimons and Rod Donald will each deliver a 20 minute speech from 9.30 on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>The AGM will consider nine remits, including one from the Green MPs asking the Party membership to back the caucus stand against supporting any government that lifts the moratorium on the release of genetically engineered organisms into the environment.</p>
<p>Another remit sets up a negotiating team and a timeframe for any coalition talks should the Greens hold a balance of power position after the next election. Both of these remits will be heard on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>On Saturday night Auckland Greens have organised a dance party called Kakariki at the Wyndham Bowling Club from 9pm. The line-up features Epsilon Blue, SJD, Golden Horse, Stinky Jim, Big Matt, Submariner and Nandor. Visuals by Kog.</p>
