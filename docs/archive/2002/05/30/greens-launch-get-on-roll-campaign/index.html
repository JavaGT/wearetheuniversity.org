<p>29 May 2002</p>
<p>Green MP Nandor Tanczos today launched the Green Party&#39;s campaign to get people on the electoral roll.</p>
<p>Nandor and visiting Australian Senator, 28-year-old Kerry Nettle, kicked off the campaign at Victoria University this afternoon with the Victoria Greens. They handed out the Green &#39;Get on the Roll&#39; stickers and posters to the sounds of the new Green Room CD, organic food was provided.</p>
<p>The campaign features Nandor on a skateboard and promotes 0800 ENROL NOW, the Electoral Commission&#39;s free phone line. Nandor said the campaign will be a key piece of the Green election strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not just good for Greens, its good for everyone to increase participation in elections. This does not mean that voting will solve all our problems, but it is one way for ordinary people to have influence,&quot; said Nandor.</p>
<p>&quot;People think, with good reason, that most politicians are crap. Well it won&#39;t get any better if you don&#39;t vote.&quot;</p>
<p>Nandor said the focus was on enrolling young people.</p>
<p>&quot;Young people are probably the most alienated from the political system. They can&#39;t see the point of participating in a parliament that only seems to represent the rich and powerful. Well, the point is to get a different kind of voice in there.</p>
<p>&quot;Young people need to get involved because the decisions made today will affect them for the rest of their lives. As an example, this election may be the last chance to vote for a GE-Free Aotearoa.</p>
<p>&quot;When the Greens made it into Parliament on special votes at the last election, a heap of people saw that their individual vote made a difference. On the other hand, Auckland has John Banks for Mayor because so few people bothered to vote.</p>
<p>&quot;We have one of the most diverse and representative parliaments in the world. Lets make it better yet.&quot;</p>
