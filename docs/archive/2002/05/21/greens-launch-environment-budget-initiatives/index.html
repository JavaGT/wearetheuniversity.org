<p><strong>Tuesday, 21 May 2002, 11:56 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>21 May 2002</p>
<p>Green Co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons today announced a package of five environmental Budget initiatives promoted by the Greens and funded by the Government.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greens and the Government have worked co-operatively to make significant progress in these key environmental areas. Substantial financial allocations have been committed to each of them,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Green Party initiatives are:</p>
<p>* $5.9 million over four years to establish environmental programmes in schools. New advisor positions at Colleges of Education will provide resources and help to teachers to develop ecological thinking across the curriculum;</p>
<p>* $300,000 of new money for environment centres. This adds to $300,000 set up in last year&#39;s Green Budget initiative - effectively doubling the funding.</p>
<p>* $350,000 of new money for biosecurity awareness programmes. This adds to the $875,000 that will be rolled over from last year&#39;s Green Budget initiative.</p>
<p>The Green Party and the Government have jointly promoted budget bids to put:</p>
<p>* $12.6 million over four years of new money to implement the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy;</p>
<p>* $3.2 million this year towards cleaning up sites contaminated with highly toxic materials and working towards setting up a national register of contaminated sites;</p>
<p>&quot;Together these projects total around $8.5 million this year,&quot; said Ms Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>&quot;This money and these programmes will help build awareness and change behaviour to turn around the environmental crisis. These initiatives reflect the Green Party&#39;s commitment to the long term survival of the planet as well as a productive and co-operative working relationship with the Government.&quot;</p>
