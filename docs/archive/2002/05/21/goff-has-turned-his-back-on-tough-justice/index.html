<p><strong>Tuesday, 21 May 2002, 2:01 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>

<p>Justice Minister, Phil Goff, had a chance to deliver the tough justice legislation hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders are calling for, but he failed them miserably, says National&#39;s Justice spokesperson, Wayne Mapp.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an appalling breach of trust. Mr Goff could have seen the country&#39;s worst criminals dealt with, but instead he voted against &#39;life without parole&#39; for the worst murderers, and he voted against denying serious violent offenders parole before two-thirds of their sentence was up.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders have a right to feel cheated. They called for real action on violent crime and all Labour delivered was a lukewarm policy with discretionary parole provisions.</p>
<p>&quot;That is not good enough. While Mr Goff argues &quot;there will be nothing to stop a judge imposing much longer non-parole periods of 20-40 years&quot;, how likely is that to happen even for the worst murderers?</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister has done little on criminal justice policy in two and a half years. He has actually promoted a law that allows rapists sentenced to nine years&#39; imprisonment to be eligible for parole in three years. Meanwhile, violent crime has spiralled out of control - up 5.9 percent last year on top of 4.7 percent the year before.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#39;s needed is specific direction on the issue so New Zealanders can have the criminal law they were promised.. In New South Wales, &#39;life without parole&#39; was supported by all political parties - it is a pity that our Government has missed the boat,&quot; says Dr Mapp.</p>
