<p>&quot;The growing problem for people aged over 45 to get a job is highlighted by the long-term unemployment figures,&quot; says National&#39;s Welfare spokesman Bob Simcock.</p>
<p>&quot;The long-term unemployment figures for people aged over 45 are the fastest growing by age of any group and yet it is clear this week&#39;s Budget is not going to address this increasing social problem.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem I know is even worse than what official figures show as many older people don&#39;t bother registering and yet they want to work.</p>
<p>&quot;I am so concerned about the situation, I have instigated my own survey in the Waikato. Already the comments coming back show many people in the mature age-bracket have had bad experiences purely because of their age.</p>
<p>&quot;In Christchurch the local mature employment agency is facing a funding crisis and I know many other such agencies around the country are facing similar difficulties,&quot; Mr Simcock concluded.</p>
