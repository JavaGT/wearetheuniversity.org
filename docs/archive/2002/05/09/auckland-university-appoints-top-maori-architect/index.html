<p>University Of Auckland Appoints Top Maori Architect</p>
<p>The University of Auckland&#39;s School of Architecture has appointed distinguished Maori architect Rewi Thompson as its first Adjunct Professor.</p>
<p>Professor Thompson has received 20 architecture awards in New Zealand and been involved in a number of prominent Maori and bicultural architecture projects.</p>
<p>As well as teaching architecture at the School, he will be responsible for developing an appropriate cultural focus, with special concern for Maori students.</p>
<p>Professor Thompson says he is looking forward to the role.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an exciting challenge in Maori architecture at present, with 80% of New Zealand&#39;s Maori population now living in urban areas,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;The spaces in which Maori live, work and meet are required to be different to what they were 30 years ago, and it is important we train students to respond to these changing needs.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Thompson says the use of Maori concepts can make a major contribution to developing unique and authentic architecture.</p>
<p>&quot;Central to Maoridom are ideas of family, warmth, love and community. By understanding these values and translating them into architecture, our natural and built environment can be more meaningful.</p>
<p>&quot;Maori also have strong ties to nature and the land, so this needs to be reflected in a holistic approach to architecture, including the use of sustainable design.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Thompson will teach on the Bachelor of Architecture degree, run through the School of Architecture.</p>

<p>This will include the teaching of a recently introduced paper, Biculturalism in Architecture, which studies a new approach to architecture based on Tangata Whenua (Maori culture) and Manuhiri (people from other cultures). As an adjunct professor, Professor Thompson will devote his time between The University of Auckland and his private architecture practise.</p>
<p>Professor Thompson has made a significant contribution in Maori and New Zealand architecture.</p>
<p>His most notable projects include new Maori Studies facilities at UNITEC and Tairawhiti Polytechnic, housing in Manukau for Housing New Zealand, revitalisation of the Otara shopping centre, and the Ruapoutaka and Ngati Otara Marae.</p>
<p>He has also served as Maori Design Consultant for new correctional facilities in Ngawha and Meremere, and a new hospital in Wellington for Capital Coast Health.</p>
<p>His awards include a UNESCO International Award for a house design for urban Maori, and New Zealand Institute of Architects awards for the UNITEC facility and Exscite, a children&#39;s museum in Hamilton. In 1999 he won a Tasman/Environmental Award for his design of Wishart House at Hokianga Harbour.</p>
<p>Professor Thompson has tutored and served as an advisor at numerous tertiary institutions throughout New Zealand. Over the past 15 years he has also adjudicated architecture awards including the New Zealand Institute of Architects Students Awards and the Auckland Architectural Association Awards.</p>
