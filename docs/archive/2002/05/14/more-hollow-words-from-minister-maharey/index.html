<p>More Hollow Words from Minister Maharey</p>
<p>Tuesday 14 May 2002 Dr Muriel Newman Press Releases -- Tertiary Education</p>
<p>ACT Tertiary Education Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman said the Government&#39;s finalised Tertiary Education Strategy released today is the type of fine sounding hollow document that is becoming the hallmark of Minister Steve Maharey.</p>
<p>&quot;The strategy has some admirable goals - but there&#39;s no detail of how the goals will be achieved. I&#39;m particularly concerned that there&#39;s no outline of financing and resources to meet the aims of the strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;I think educators in general will be disappointed with this.</p>
<p>&quot;None will be more disappointed than the Private Training Establishments who have seen their ability to offer new ranges of courses sawn off by the Minister&#39;s draconian moratorium on new funding clamped on them last year.</p>
<p>&quot;The irony is that it was the PTEs that were taking the lead in a lot of what this strategy talks about - particularly in respect to development of levels of achievement by Maori and Pacific Islanders.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government talks big about improving Maori and Pacific participation and achievement and yet its PTE moratorium is totally counter to that. Maori and Pacific peoples last year made up 36 percent of PTE students, but just 17 percent of state sector tertiary students.</p>
<p>&quot;In the future I believe this strategy will be seen as a lost opportunity. Given the length of time taken, the consultation, the no-doubt substantial amount of money spent, New Zealanders could justifiably have expected a strong structural framework for the future operation of the tertiary system - not just nice sounding generalities,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
