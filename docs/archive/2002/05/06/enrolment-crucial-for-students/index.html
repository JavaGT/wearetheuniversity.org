<p><strong>Monday, 6 May 2002, 9:52 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association">Victoria University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>The General Election Enrolment Campaign will be launched tomorrow, student representatives are calling for a focus on enrolling students in the lead up to the General Election this year.</p>
<p>‘It is important that students are targeted in the enrolment campaign as they change electorate and address more often than other people so are more likely not to receive enrolment packs,’ said Victoria University Students’ Association President Fleur Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>‘With an early election looking likely it is crucial that student enrolment is focused on to improve turnout and ensure that votes cast are valid’, continued Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>The Students’ Association at Victoria University will have forms for students to fill out if they have not received one or are concerned that they are not on the electoral roll.</p>
<p>‘At Victoria University we have a lot of students from out of town, many voting for their first time, the Students Association will be working with the Elections New Zealand office to make sure that these students are enrolled’, concluded Fitzsimons.</p>
