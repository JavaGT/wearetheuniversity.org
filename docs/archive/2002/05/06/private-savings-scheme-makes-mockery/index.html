<p>Consideration Of Private Savings Scheme Makes Mockery Of Public Tertiary Education</p>
<p>6/5/2002,<br>Otago students today struck out at suggestions by the Minister responsible for Tertiary Education, Steve Maharey, of a private savings scheme for tertiary education, calling it an abandonment of a public interest in tertiary education.</p>
<p>&quot;After nine years of the National Party cutting the funding and quality of tertiary education, New Zealand thought that it had turned a corner with the election of the Labour-Alliance government. It seems that all that is to be undone with the Minister considering a private savings scheme, ignoring the fact that 80% of the public think that all students should get an allowance. [Colmar Brunton public opinion research, 2000]&quot; said Otago University Students Association Campaign Coordinator Kyle Matthews.</p>
<p>Although details of the scheme are yet to be released, information released by the private group FUNZ in April indicate that a family would need to save eighteen dollars per week per student over eighteen years, to save $27,000, enough for a single bachelors degree. That figure rises to fifty dollars to save $75,000, enough for a student to become a medical doctor or complete postgraduate study.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is skipping around the real issues in student support, with discussions of limiting loan living costs, and forcing repayments. How often do we have to tell the government &#39;students are worth supporting, the right step is to give all students an allowance&#39;? What&#39;s so difficult about ending the discriminatory bonding of students under twenty-five to their parents and giving them the same financial support that everyone else in our society gets?&quot; said Otago Polytechnic Students Association Vice-President Michelle Watt.</p>
