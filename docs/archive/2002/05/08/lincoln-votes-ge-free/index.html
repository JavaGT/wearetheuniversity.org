<p><strong>Wednesday, 8 May 2002, 11:27 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University_Students_Association">Lincoln University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Students from Lincoln University yesterday voted in a referendum, and voted to make New Zealand a Genetic Engineering (GE) free country.</p>
<p>“This shows that students do care about this important national issue,” said Melony Clark, Environmental Officer for the Lincoln University Students’ Association (LUSA).</p>
<p>The vote was held over two days and asked students to vote on four statements: * That New Zealand should have a GE-Free position * That GE research should be allowed to be conducted, but kept in the laboratory * That GE field trials should be allowed to be carried out * That New Zealand should grow commercial crops (GE)</p>
<p>“The vote focused on GE in agriculture as this is Lincoln University’s core business and we do not have a medical school,” said Greg Henderson, President of LUSA.</p>
<p>“The other votes in the referendum were interesting and found that students did agree with GE research in the laboratory (63.3%),” said Henderson.</p>
<p>“There was a strong voter group (12% average) that were still not sure whether they agreed or disagreed with GE which shows that there are still many people that feel that they do not have all the facts,” said Clark.</p>
<p>“The government has a lot of answering to do and must make sure that they are sure of the issues before making any decisions on this very important issue,” said Henderson.</p>
<p>“Genetic Engineering in New Zealand must remain in the laboratory. We do not want to have the same problems as some countries overseas are already experiencing,” said Clark. “Lincoln University students do not want GE in New Zealand.”</p>
