<p>Minister Must Direct Health Boards To Release Budgets</p>
<p>Health Minister Annette King should direct all district health boards to release their budgets for the 2002-03 financial year, National Health Spokesperson Roger Sowry said today.</p>
<p>Figures just released show Otago District Health Board won&#39;t be able to work within its budget and may have to cut services. &quot;This will be the case for many boards around the country but the public are not hearing about this because the Minister won&#39;t let them talk publicly about their financial woes.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry of Health said to NZPA on Monday that it was up to the district health boards to release the budgets because the budgets &#39;belonged&#39; to the DHBs. But we all know that Annette King has thumped down hard on boards talking about their financial struggle to provide adequate services,&quot; Mr Sowry said.</p>
<p>Mr Sowry called on the Minister to instruct all of the DHBs to immediately release their budgets for next year.</p>
<p>&quot;This information belongs to the taxpaying public of New Zealand and they should be told what district health boards are getting and what problems they might face.</p>
<p>&quot;We are already hearing stories around the country about possible service cuts during the course of the three year health funding path announced by the Minister last December. Taxpayers have a right to know what these will be, especially after Labour&#39;s promise that it would raise taxes to provide better health services,&quot; Mr Sowry said.</p>
