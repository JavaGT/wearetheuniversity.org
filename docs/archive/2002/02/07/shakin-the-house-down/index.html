<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>7 February 2002</p>
<p>Shakin&#39; The House Down</p>
<p>There&#39;ll be earthquakes in Canterbury over the next two months, and for earthquake enthusiast and engineering graduate, Jeff Matthews, the bigger the shake the better.</p>
<p>But the quakes will be no natural occurrence, Jeff and his University of Canterbury Department of Civil Engineering team will be simulating, then testing and measuring man-made earthquakes on a slice of a building representing a lower floor in a multi-storey pre-cast concrete building.</p>
<p>The aim is to find out just how much load and stress parts of a building, and in particular the pre-cast concrete structures will handle in the event of an earthquake.</p>
<p>Jeff Matthews&#39; PhD research is funded through the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology&#39;s Technology for Industry Fellowships scheme, which has enabled him to work alongside businesses such as Firth Industries and Stresscrete, who are keenly interested in the performance of concrete in construction.</p>
<p>Jeff is carrying out the research using the University&#39;s equipment and expanding his own background in earthquake engineering.</p>
<p>Recent events have highlighted the performance of buildings under stress, and the three-year research builds on New Zealand&#39;s internationally regarded expertise in earthquake engineering.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ve used the same construction methods over the past 20 years in New Zealand and this is a unique opportunity to really test the entire structure and see how the building performs with pre-cast floor slabs,&quot; he says.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ll be using hydraulic rams to simulate the forces of a real earthquake and computer-tracking the action of the components in slow motion. What we want to find out is how much pre-cast concrete can take and still remain standing&quot;, says Jeff Matthews.</p>
<p>Len McSaveney, formerly of Stresscrete, one of the partner companies in the research project, says this research is significant as it is the first time an entire building structure has been tested in this way. Early results from the research were presented to a conference in Rotorua recently and earthquake-prone countries are following progress closely.</p>
