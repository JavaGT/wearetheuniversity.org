<p><strong>Thursday, 7 February 2002, 10:21 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Business_Roundtable">New Zealand Business Roundtable</a></strong></p>
<p>Norman LaRocque, economist and specialist in domestic and international education policy and reform issues, has been appointed to a policy advisor position with the New Zealand Business Roundtable, NZBR executive director Roger Kerr announced today.</p>
<p>Mr LaRocque was previously with Arthur Andersen where he was a director in the Global Corporate Finance Division. He has an MA (Economics) and a BA (Honors Economics) from the University of Western Ontario.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Arthur Andersen, Norman LaRocque worked as a consultant to the World Bank, where he provided advice on regulatory frameworks and private education in a number of countries including New Zealand, the Philippines, China, India, Oman, Cameroon and several West African countries.</p>
<p>From 1992 to 1997 he worked with the New Zealand Treasury advising on tertiary education, labour market and employment policy, and more recently was a senior manager with the New Zealand Ministry of Education, with responsibility for social policy and school regulatory issues. He has also held various positions with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>Mr LaRocque&#39;s appointment follows the recent retirement of longstanding NZBR policy analyst and educationalist Michael Irwin.</p>
<p>Mr Kerr said the appointment of Norman LaRocque signalled the Business Roundtable&#39;s strong interest in promoting high quality, competitive education in New Zealand, and its intention to continue to contribute to education policy through research and debate on issues at all levels of New Zealand education.</p>
