<p><strong>Thursday, 7 February 2002, 9:41 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>

<p>&quot;Pete Hodgson&#39;s decision to suddenly pull out of a summit on the Kyoto Protocol puts the Government&#39;s consultation process with business on this issue in perspective,&quot; says National Finance spokesman David Carter.</p>
<p>&quot;When the heat goes on - it runs. Business is not happy with the Government&#39;s stance on Kyoto and has told it so.</p>
<p>&quot;But instead of being prepared to listen to the commercial sector&#39;s genuine concerns, Pete Hodgson has thrown his toys out of the cot and refuses to engage with business.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Carter says it is arrogant and gutless of the Government when its &#39;Climate Change&#39; Minister will not front-up to the business community and explain why it is so intent on signing New Zealand up to Kyoto before our major trading partners.</p>
<p>&quot;Pete Hodgson had been invited, and had agreed, to speak at the Northern Employers and Manufacturers Association&#39;s Kyoto Summit in Auckland some time ago.</p>
<p>&quot;But at the last minute, he has decided that the Otago University&#39;s clubs and associations open day is more important than the business sector and no other Cabinet Minister is willing to take his place.&quot;</p>
<p>David Carter says National is not afraid to engage with the business sector about the Kyoto Protocol and that he and Agriculture Spokesman Gavan Herlihy are both looking forward to attending the summit on February 20.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike the current Government, we want to hear what the business sector has to say about this most important issue,&quot; Mr Carter concluded.</p>
