<p><strong>Thursday, 21 February 2002, 3:58 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions">New Zealand Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p>“The Council of Trade Unions decided today to promote debate among union members to assess the level of support for the constitutional change to a republic,” CTU President Ross Wilson said today.</p>
<p>“Unions representing in total around a quarter of a million workers at a National Council meeting in Wellington today decided that unions would promote debate on this very important issue,” he said.</p>
<p>Ross Wilson said the CTU is the largest democratic organisation in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“We believe that the time has come to have a serious national debate on our constitutional future with its implications for our country’s governance, name, flag, final court of appeal and international image,” he said.</p>
<p>Ross Wilson said the CTU recognised the special concerns of Maori on this issue and the CTU Maori Council (Te Runanga o Nga Kaimahi Maori o Aotearoa) would be bringing together those concerns as part of the debate.</p>
<p>“The challenge of these decisions is confronting us and the CTU is concerned to ensure that the debate is not confined to a limited group of academics and the elite,” he said.</p>
<p>“The issues are too important for that”.</p>
