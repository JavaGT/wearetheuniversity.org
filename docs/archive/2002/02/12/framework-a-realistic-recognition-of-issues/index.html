<p><strong>Tuesday, 12 February 2002, 4:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions">New Zealand Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p>Innovation Framework A Realistic Recognition Of Issues</p>
<p>“The Government‘s Growth and Innovation Framework announced today is a realistic recognition of the failure of past policies and the strengths of New Zealanders,” said secretary of the Council of Trade Unions Paul Goulter today.</p>
<p>“The framework recognises that the way forward is as partners – government, business, unions and the research and tertiary sector,” he said.</p>
<p>“The setting up of the advisory board and associated taskforces is welcomed and unions will be fully participating in the process.”</p>
<p>Paul Goulter said the targeted areas of biotechnology, communication and creative industries were obvious choices.</p>
<p>“However, it is welcome news that those areas where industry strategies are already underway, such as the wood industry, will not be disadvantaged,” he said.</p>
<p>Paul Goulter said continued recognition of the critical need for skill strategy was an essential part of the innovation framework.</p>
<p>“That raises issues for workers of the accessibility to training and upgrading and appropriate reward,” he said.</p>
