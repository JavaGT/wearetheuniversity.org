<p><strong>Friday, 15 February 2002, 4:08 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association">Victoria University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Students Call For Focus On Support Services For International Students</p>
<p>Students at Victoria University are calling on the University to recognise the support services needed to ensure that international students get the most from there time at Victoria University. This call is in response to the Trade New Zealand Export Award the University received yesterday for its marketing to international students.</p>
<p>‘There is significant anecdotal evidence to suggest that international students are not given the support services they require’ said Victoria University Students Association President Fleur Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>‘The University do well marketing to international students now they need to take a step back and consider the support services offered to those students once they are here’ said Fleur Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>‘International students have different support needs in terms of tuition and assistance as well as requiring pastoral care needed when living in a country that is not your home, and the University must start to recognise this’ said Fleur Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>‘The Students’ Association have recognised the cultural benefits of having International students around campus by setting up an advocacy and mentoring scheme. This scheme will see New Zealand students regularly meeting with international students in an effort to welcome those students and promote cultural understanding’ said Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>‘It is now up to the University to invest in further support services for international students’ concluded Fitzsimons.</p>
