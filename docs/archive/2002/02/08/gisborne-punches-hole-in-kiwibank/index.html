<p><strong>Friday, 8 February 2002, 9:17 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Thursday 7 Feb 2002</p>
<p>ACT Finance Spokesman Rodney Hide today described news that Gisborne will miss out on Kiwibank as a big hit on Jim Anderton&#39;s political baby, but unsurprising.</p>
<p>&quot;NZ Post&#39;s costings are based on ripping off franchisees by paying them only 53 cents a transaction. That&#39;s well below cost.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s no surprise that many franchisees are refusing to take on Kiwibank. NZ Post expects franchisees to lose thousands of dollars to make Kiwibank work. NZ Post can&#39;t even sell Kiwibank to the very people they are dependent on to sell Kiwibank to the public.</p>
<p>&quot;Jim Anderton promised the people of Gisborne a bank. He promised Kiwibank would `rebuild regional New Zealand by opening services in areas where previously they were closing&#39;. He promised the bank would `employ people in the regions&#39;. He promised to `keep foreign banks honest&#39; by opening Kiwibank branches just down the road. He told us that `while the overseas banks are closing branches, the new bank will be opening them&#39;. He hasn&#39;t delivered.</p>
<p>&quot;This makes a laughing-stock of Mr Anderton&#39;s Tairawhiti Taskforce.</p>
<p>&quot;The hole that Gisborne has punched in Kiwibank&#39;s nation-wide coverage is just the start. Other communities are going to miss out too.</p>
<p>&quot;The promised banking service that $80 million of taxpayers&#39; money was to buy just isn&#39;t materialising,&quot; Mr Hide said.</p>
