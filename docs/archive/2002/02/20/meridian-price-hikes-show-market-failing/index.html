<p><strong>Wednesday, 20 February 2002, 2:26 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Green Party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said today that possible big increases in electricity prices for Canterbury businesses shows why a competitive electricity market does not work for consumers.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a pseudo-competitive market based on a single supply system. Hydro stations ought to be run as an integrated system throughout the country. Instead we have regional suppliers trying to shed the risks created by a lack of integration.&quot;</p>
<p>Meridian Energy has notified 60 Canterbury businesses that it will not renew their fixed-price contracts and that they would have to pay the volatile spot rate for electricity.</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons said it was absurd that Canterbury businesses were being denied electricity at predictable prices, when so much of the nation&#39;s electricity was produced very close by.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation where some users are going to be punished because they&#39;re in the wrong place at the wrong time was always going to happen. As a nation, we can&#39;t afford to allow electricity suppliers simply to off-load their risk onto other businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;Meridian has the know-how to manage spot risk, whereas other companies don&#39;t. It&#39;s their job to do that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Even if the experience of last winter means the prices of fixed-price electricity contracts have to rise, that is more acceptable than the complete uncertainty businesses are facing now.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons said state-owned Meridian was taking the wrong approach to lessons learned from last year&#39;s electricity crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;Electricity suppliers should focus on helping businesses to conserve energy and reduce their electricity demands, instead of hanging them out to dry.</p>
<p>&quot;There are also a lot of intermediate steps which Meridian could take to share risk and encourage energy conservation - such as offering businesses a fixed price contract with some load interruptible (such as households use for hot water heating), or negotiating a contract which includes a small percentage of spot price electricity.&quot;</p>
