<p>NZ Festival Administrator Launches Exciting New Career</p>
<p>Wellingtonian Chris Price, co-ordinator for many years of the New Zealand Festival Writers and Readers Week, will embark on an exciting new career with the launch of her debut collection of poems, &quot;Husk&quot;, during the 2002 New Zealand Festival.</p>
<p>Chris, as co-ordinator and in her former roles as editor of the literary journal &quot;Landfall&quot;, editor at Reeds and, latterly, as a lecturer in Creative Writing at Victoria University of Wellington, has spent years assessing and selecting the work of others. She now puts herself under the editorial and critical microscope, as she places her own work before the wider public.</p>
<p>&quot;Husk&quot; is a lively and enjoyable first collection of poems. “Though a debut collection, &#39;Husk&#39; is polished, elegant, mature work,” says her publisher, Auckland University Press Director Elizabeth Caffin.</p>
<p>&quot;It introduces an original new talent. These poems cover a wide range of interests, themes and tones but there is an alertness, a sense of delight about all of them and I believe this book marks the beginning of a very interesting career.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Husk&quot;, published by Auckland University Press, will be launched on 15 March 2002, at the Heineken Dans Palais, Frank Kitts Park, 5.45-7.15pm.</p>
