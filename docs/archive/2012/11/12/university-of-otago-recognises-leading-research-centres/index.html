<p>12 November 2012</p>
<p><strong>University of Otago recognises leading research centres</strong></p>
<p>The University of Otago is committing more than $2.5M over the next five years to support the internationally outstanding work of its leading research centres.</p>
<p>Following a rigorous application process, 14 research groups have each been formally designated as a ‘University of Otago Research Centre’ for at least the next five years.</p>
<p>The funding from the University’s Research Committee will supplement other grants and contributions from academic divisions over this period to support their world-class research activities.</p>
<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research &amp; Enterprise) Professor Richard Blaikie says 12 of the centres are already nationally and internationally recognised for their research excellence and the two newly established centres show similar promise.</p>
<p>“Each of these centres bring together many of our finest researchers in collaborative, multidisciplinary research platforms or programmes pushing the frontiers of knowledge in their areas,” Professor Blaikie says.</p>
<p>A demonstrated commitment to reach out and engage with relevant sectors of the community, business and government was among the selection criteria for the centres.</p>
<p>“At Otago, we believe that it is important that our research activities can be translated into real-world benefits wherever practicable. This goal is much more likely to be achieved if researchers forge close links with the end users of the research and other interested external parties,” he says.</p>
<p>The research the centres are undertaking covers a broad spectrum. It ranges from pursuing advances in atomic and optical physics that will underpin new technologies, through to exploring the development of colonial culture and how it has shaped New Zealand society.</p>
<p>Two centres are conducting large programmes looking at key aspects of how New Zealand can become more sustainable, while others have a strong focus on helping to bridge gaps between science and society.</p>
<p>A number of centres are involved in world-leading health-related research, with the goal of ensuring findings can be translated into improved treatment of diseases and disorders. Areas of focus include brain health; cancer; cardiovascular disease; diabetes and obesity; lifecourse studies; infectious diseases; neuroendocrinology; and oral health.</p>
