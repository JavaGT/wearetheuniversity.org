<p><strong>More Students Looking For Work</strong></p>
<p>Today the Otago University Students&#39; Association announced the latest figures from Student Job Search show the number of students enrolling to look for work is up 42% on the same time last year. The SJS figures show that 3,511 student have enrolled between the period 1/1/12 to 31/10/12 compared to 2474 in the same period during 2011.</p>
<p>&quot;While it&#39;s great that students are using the service it&#39;s also a grim picture of how tough students are doing it financially.&quot; Said Logan Edgar, OUSA President, &quot;We really do encourage anyone looking for extra workers whether it&#39;s part time or just a one off to try the free service to list a job.&quot;</p>
<p>The figures also show that the numbers of students placed in work during 2012 is down 13% compared to 2011.</p>
<p>&quot;The latest unemployment figures show it&#39;s tough out there for everyone, but it&#39;s important the public see the opportunity SJS offers for one off and part time employment needs.&quot; Said Mr. Edgar, &quot;Students are now going into summer holidays so there&#39;s a real opportunity for the public and private sectors to make the most of the students&#39; break and at the same time give them extra experience to add to their CVs.&quot;</p>
<p>The OUSA and student associations around the country govern the free SJS service, and 80% of those student surveyed in the latest OUSA research said that SJS is an important or very important service provided by OUSA. Listing a job on the SJS service is free and easy, all that&#39;s needed is to register on the website and follow the step by step instructions at <a href="http://www.sjs.co.nz">www.sjs.co.nz</a></p>
