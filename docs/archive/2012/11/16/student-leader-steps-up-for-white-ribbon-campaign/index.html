<p><strong>Student leader steps up to the mark for White Ribbon campaign</strong></p>
<p>Pete Hodkinson, President of the NZ Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA), today became the latest Ambassador for the White Ribbon campaign on the eve of the White Ribbon Ride starting tomorrow Saturday 17 November.</p>
<p>The White Ribbon Day campaign raises awareness of men’s violence against women – which in New Zealand is generally directly at wives, girlfriends and other intimate partners. Ambassadors use their public profile to champion a violence free lifestyle to other men.</p>
<p>“I’m honoured to be joining other White Ribbon Ambassadors in encouraging all men to exhibit zero tolerance for any form of violence towards women,” says Pete Hodkinson.</p>
<p>“As well as offering my personal support to the campaign I’m putting out a call to all male students to examine their behaviour and to commit to pushing back on all forms of violence – including psychological and emotional abuse – by taking the White Ribbon Pledge publicly via Facebook <a href="http://www.facebook.com/whiteribbonnz">http://www.facebook.com/whiteribbonnz</a></p>
<p>“This year’s focus on the amount of fear that is caused by violent verbal behaviour is a reminder of forms of abuse that are too often underestimated.</p>
<p>“As students head into a break from their studies this is a good time to reflect on any negative behaviour they may have witnessed during the year. As they head into 2013 they should do so with a determination to make the places they live and study in, the safest possible environments for women, and to speak out against violence”.</p>
<p>Notes: Pete Hodkinson will be serving his second term as President of NZUSA in 2013 after being re-elected in 2012. Through his involvement in the Student movement Pete has represented New Zealand students locally during his time at Unitec, nationally through NZUSA and is also actively engaged in working with the Pacific Students Association and Commonwealth Students Association. He represented New Zealand at the Global Student Leadership Summit held in London in September 2012. He is an accomplished public speaker, a musician and a Crossfit athlete.</p>
