<p><strong>Key Notes: Celebrating The Hobbit</strong><br><strong>30 November 2012</strong><br><a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-22199.link"></a></p>
<p>It was great to be with Bronagh at the premiere of <em>The Hobbit:</em> <em>An Unexpected Journey</em>. There were so many excited fans lining Courtenay Place. They&#39;d waited for hours in the sun dressed as elves, hobbits, and dwarves, and they made the day very special.</p>
<p>I&#39;m proud our Government took action to make sure <em>The Hobbit</em> films were made here. They created 3000 jobs and poured millions of dollars into our regions. Learn <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-22200.link">more</a>.</p>
<p>The films showcase New Zealand&#39;s stunning landscapes, which will be seen by millions of people around the world. This is great advertising for our tourism industry.</p>
<p>Sir Peter Jackson and his team are some of the best filmmakers in the world - congratulations to all who were involved.</p>
<p><strong>Visiting Cambodia and Myanmar</strong></p>
<p>Last weekend I returned from the East Asia Summit in Cambodia, and an official visit to Myanmar. In Cambodia I joined <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-22201.link">President Obama</a> and other leaders to advance the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations. Next month, New Zealand is hosting round 15 of the TPP negotiations in Auckland.</p>
<p>I also met leaders to start work on the new 16-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Both agreements could massively expand our export markets.</p>

<p>From Cambodia I went to Myanmar, becoming the first New Zealand Prime Minister to visit that country. I met President Thein Sein, who is visiting New Zealand next month, and opposition leader <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-22202.link">Aung San Suu Kyi</a>. For many years Aung San Suu Kyi made great personal sacrifices to help bring democratic reform to Myanmar.</p>
<p>In a sobering visit, I also went to <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-22203.link">Taukkyan War Cemetery</a> to honour Kiwi soldiers who died in World War II.</p>

<p><strong>From my diary</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday I joined the science community to celebrate the Prime Minister&#39;s Science Prizes, and then travelled to Hobbiton, near Matamata, where I opened the Green Dragon Pub. Today I&#39;m in Darfield opening a $500 million milk processing plant for Fonterra. Tomorrow I&#39;m going to the Waikato to open the Te Rapa bypass, which is part of the SH1 Waikato Expressway - one of the Government&#39;s seven Roads of National Significance.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p><strong>John Key<br>Prime Minister</strong><br><a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-22209.link">www. johnkey. co. nz</a></p>
