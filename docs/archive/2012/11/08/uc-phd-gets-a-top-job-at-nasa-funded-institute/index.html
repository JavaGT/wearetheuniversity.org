<p><strong>Former UC PhD student appointed to a top job at NASA-funded US institute</strong></p>
<p><strong>November 8, 2012</strong></p>
<p>A former University of Canterbury (UC) student and Christchurch resident Dr Graham Scott has been named the new vice president and associate director of the US National Space Biomedical Research Institute.</p>
<p>Dr Scott served as a pilot for nine years in the Royal New Zealand Air Force. He received a bachelor&#39;s degree in chemistry and physics and a PhD (1998) in chemistry at UC.</p>
<p>The institute was set up in 1997 by NASA to look into science, technology and education projects across the United States.</p>
<p>Dr Scott brings more than 30 years of scientific, military aviation and commercial experience to the NASA-funded institute. His background includes positions leading large scientific teams conducting groundbreaking research in the areas of gene sequencing and proteomics and in technology development.</p>
<p>His duties at the institute include managing the institute&#39;s science and technology programme as chief scientist and overseeing operation of its education programmes.</p>
<p>Institute chief executive Dr Jeffrey Sutton said Scott&#39;s expertise in biotechnology and leadership would provide a new exciting dimension to efforts to protect astronaut health and to improve life on Earth.</p>
<p>``His energy and vision will also strengthen our education programmes and enhance the utilization of the institute&#39;s new state-of-the-art consolidated research facility.&quot;</p>
<p>Prior to joining the institute, Scott served as market development director for sequencing at Life Technologies. In addition to his position at the institute, Scott holds a faculty position at Baylor College of Medicine, NSBRI&#39;s lead institution.</p>
<p>Dr Scott said he was honoured to be joining the talented and dedicated institute team.</p>
<p>``Over the last decade, I participated in the genomics and proteomics revolution that is now transforming the practice of medicine. These &#39;omics&#39; technologies are ushering in a new era of personalised treatment and countermeasures, further reducing risks associated with human space travel.’’</p>
