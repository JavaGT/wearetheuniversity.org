<p>Solution needed for bureaucratic obstacle course</p>
<p>Building and Construction Minister, Maurice Williamson, needs to step up and resolve the bureaucratic obstacle course faced by leaky home owners, says Labour MP Raymond Huo.</p>
<p>“Victims of the leaky homes disaster have told me that the Government’s Financial Assistance Package (FAP) seems designed to frustrate them.</p>
<p>“I’m told there are at least 24 steps to follow to get an application processed for the FAP - that sounds like excessive bureaucracy to me.</p>
<p>“Mr Williamson today defended his so-called leaky home rescue package - saying 24 homeowners got full payments – double what was reported yesterday.</p>
<p>“I doubt the Minister’s defence will give much confidence to those knee-deep in paper. We are talking about a multi-billion dollar botch-up, with thousands of aggrieved homeowners, many, years away from resolution.</p>
<p>“I agree with Home Owners and Buyers Association President John Gray that the scheme has failed. Mr Gray has criticised the excessive bureaucracy, the long delays and difficulty of getting jobs approved and money paid.</p>
<p>“Maurice Williamson claims the FAP is working, but the message from victims suggests otherwise. Ultimately, this is only the tip of the iceberg. Homeowners unable to get loans for their portion of the repairs, and therefore not able to take advantage of the scheme; have not even been factored in by the Minister.</p>
<p>“This is another example a lot of talk, but little follow-though from National. Victims should not have to come up against a brick wall of bureaucracy and be frustrated.</p>
<p>“Maurice Williamson is charged with the task, it is his role to show some leadership and break down that wall,” Raymond Huo said.<br>ends</p>
