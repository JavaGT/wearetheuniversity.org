<p><strong>Of course frackers don’t want more fracking regulations</strong></p>
<p>The public debate and Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment’s report into fracking needs to be based on the facts, not industry spin, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>The Green Party was responding to Todd Energy’s claims that the controversial practice of fracking was safe and essential for New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Turkeys don’t vote for an early Christmas. It is not surprising Todd Energy is calling for its controversial practices to be allowed to continue without more strict oversight,” said Green Party energy spokesperson Gareth Hughes.</p>
<p>“Contrary to Shell Todd Energy’s statements, we know that fracking has not been done well, or regulated well and this ‘hands off’ approach has led to actual environmental harm in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Shell Todd Energy has been responsible for soil and groundwater contamination under their Kapuni wellsites where fracking has occurred.</p>
<p>“Shell Todd Energy’s sites were contaminated by a dispersed plume of dissolved hydrocarbons, and clean-up of the soil is underway with truckloads being transported to Wellington for treatment.</p>
<p>“Shell Todd Oil’s own report from 2011 found that discharge of fracking fluids in Taranaki resulted in groundwater contamination that was unsuitable for drinking, stock use, or for irrigation.</p>
<p>“Fracking in New Zealand has not been done to a high standard with fracking fluids discharged down a Southland stream, no full list of chemicals used released publicly and fracking undertaken without a consent from the Regional Council in Waikato.</p>

<p>“It is unfair for Todd in their report to criticise people questioning this controversial practice, including a number of councils when by a lack of transparency industry has been its own worst enemy.</p>
<p>“Our economy depends on our clean green environment – we need rules to protect our environment and our economy, not rules to benefit polluting industries.</p>
<p>“Fracking isn’t essential for New Zealand and we have a wealth of clean energy options,” said Mr Hughes.</p>
