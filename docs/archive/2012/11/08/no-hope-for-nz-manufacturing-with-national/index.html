<p>8 November 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>No Hope for NZ Manufacturing with National</strong></p>
<p>Last night many New Zealanders were cheering for hope in America, but today they’re waking up to the realisation that our own National government’s economic policies are hopeless, Labour’s economic development spokesperson David Cunliffe says.</p>
<p>Advanced design manufacturer Dynamic Controls has this morning announced plans to close its New Zealand manufacturing operations with the loss of up to 60 jobs.</p>
<p>“Dynamic Controls has been a leader in high-tech mobility systems. The proposed job losses in Middleton are another painful kick in the guts to Canterbury,” David Cunliffe says.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately the downsizing of Dynamic Controls is just the latest indicator of the crisis in manufacturing. It comes just after redundancies at advanced crystals maker Rakon in Auckland and the sale of Fisher &amp; Paykel Appliances offshore.</p>
<p>“New Zealand manufacturing is collapsing, and just this morning we learned unemployment hit a horrific 7.3% in September.</p>
<p>“But the National government only sits on the sidelines waving goodbye to hope. As other countries look to better days ahead, in New Zealand John Key’s policies only offer more decline.</p>
<p>“Labour has the bold, innovative ideas needed for a new economy. Labour’s research and development tax credits would be a direct advantage to companies such as Dynamic Controls, and could see jobs grow instead of ever-more Kiwis being chucked on the unemployment scrapheap and leaving for Australia,” David Cunliffe said.</p>

<p>“Labour will actively work with the high-tech sector to develop solutions so they can grow and flourish in New Zealand, creating employment and reducing our external deficit.</p>
<p>“Labour is also working with opposition parties on our Inquiry into Manufacturing. Labour offers energy and the hope of a New Zealand whose best days are ahead of us. Meanwhile National, as ever, dishonestly promises ‘brighter futures’ but actually offers Kiwis nothing but economic vandalism,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
