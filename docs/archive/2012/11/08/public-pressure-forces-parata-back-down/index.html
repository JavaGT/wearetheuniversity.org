<p>Lianne<br>DALZIEL<br>Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson<br>8 November 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Public pressure forces Parata back-down</strong></p>
<p>Hekia Parata’s about face on the mergers of four Christchurch secondary schools can’t be shrugged off as non-consequential and her protestations that mergers weren’t on her agenda are just double-speak, Labour’s Canterbury Recovery spokesperson Lianne Dalziel says.</p>
<p>“This is pure sophistry from the Education Minister and it is not something that can now be tossed into her ‘out’ tray.</p>
<p>“Ms Parata is attempting to cover her back by saying she had never received formal proposals to merge the schools – Christchurch and Avonside Girls’ and Shirley and Christchurch Boys’ – hence their mergers were never part of the Canterbury renewal plan.</p>
<p>“The only reason she hadn’t received a specific proposal was because her Ministry was still waiting for detailed geotechnical reports on those schools.</p>
<p>“Mergers or closures of these schools were as much on the cards as was keeping them open. They were all options put forward by officials.</p>
<p>“The truth is Ms Parata has backed down because of another major public backlash. These schools pulled out all the stops to achieve this.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, for other schools not awaiting technical reports, their fate was sealed when the Minister announced the plan.</p>
<p>“This has meant huge stress for families already struggling to deal with the aftermath of the earthquakes.</p>
<p>“It could all have been avoided if Ms Parata had consulted with schools and parents before her ‘firm proposals’ were promoted,” Lianne Dalziel said.</p>
