<p><strong>AUT University’s Rookie Show a Success</strong></p>
<p>AUT University’s Rookie show last night delivered on its promise to be unlike any other.</p>
<p>The show, held in underground car park Shed 15, included a 100m runway, a ‘wall of sound’, music from Electric Boutique and Voom as well as plenty of collections that had the crowd talking.</p>
<p>The collections ranged from commercial to the outrageous, and AUT’s Head of the Fashion Department, Andreas Mikellis could not have been more pleased.</p>
<p>“We wanted the show to highlight our new philosophy that promotes a far more experimental response to the idea of what fashion design is, and I think we did that.”</p>
<p>Twenty-nine collections were shown over the course of the evening, and this included four postgraduate student collections.</p>
<p>Petra Benton’s womenswear collection, inspired by the juxtaposition between being strict and precise and being completely off-kilter, was well regarded, as was Joshua Fache’s beautiful, feminine work that opened the show.</p>
<p>Menswear from Paige Mackie and Jesse Lolo were inspired by their heritage and highlighted the diversity of the group that showed on the runway.</p>
<p>Frida Kahlo inspired womenswear, sustainable materials and pieces that begin from thinking about science fiction also kept the audience’s attention throughout the night.</p>
<p>Mikellis says the students have completely embraced the department’s new vision and are setting themselves up well for the international stage.</p>
<p>“Many of the students now see their career paths from a broader, international perspective. We have growing numbers of graduates working for design companies overseas and others taking a very entrepreneurial approach by setting up design businesses in New Zealand but with a focus on an export market.”</p>
