<p>9 November<br>Immediate Release</p>
<p><strong>Primary Teachers Begin National Meetings Over Education</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of primary teachers are to begin two weeks of meetings around the country to discuss the Government’s education agenda.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa National President Ian Leckie says there is very real concern that the Government’s policies will damage our quality public education system.</p>
<p>He says these issues are being raised by teachers as part of their current collective agreement talks with the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>“The Ministry has made an offer which we believe is linked to a business model of education driven by cost-cutting and competition.</p>
<p>“What’s at stake here is our world–renowned public education system based on equity and providing good education for all children.”</p>
<p>He says the Government’s policies are based on an agenda known as the Global Education Reform Movement (GERM) which has already failed to improve students learning in other countries. The ideologically-driven policies are based around competition, data-based accountability, standardization and supposed choice.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing GERM creeping into our education system here through National Standards, league tables and charter schools and proposals of performance pay for teachers.</p>
<p>“These offers are not just an attack on teachers but the whole of our education system as we know it. “</p>
<p>As well as meetings throughout the country, there will be a series of larger gatherings in the main centres. They are 12 November - Dunedin, 14 November - Auckland, and 20 November in Wellington and Hamilton.</p>
