<p><strong>AUT University’s Rookie Show Pushing the Boundaries This Year</strong></p>
<p>AUT University’s fashion studio is alive with activity as the 24 students selected for the Rookie show frantically tweak their collections, one week out from the show.</p>
<p>The show, on November 8, will be unlike any other.</p>
<p>It will present a brave new vision for the future of New Zealand fashion according to AUT’s Head of the Fashion Department, Andreas Mikellis.</p>
<p>“This year’s show is a marker for a new philosophy for the fashion department that promotes far more experimental responses to the idea of what fashion design is,” he says.</p>
<p>“Our students are going above and beyond this year and we are at the beginning of the next big change in fashion. The work the students are producing this year is provocative and world-class with a particular focus on menswear for quite a few of them.”</p>
<p>It is not just the collections audiences can look forward to either; the 2012 show will clearly reflect this shift as well.</p>
<p>Models will be pounding along an extraordinary 99.5m runway with a backdrop of a ‘wall of sound’.</p>
<p>While the fashion and the show are the focus, Mikellis also says the students this year have embraced the department’s new vision and are setting themselves up well for the international stage.</p>
<p>“Many of the students now see their career paths from a broader, international perspective. We have growing numbers of graduates working for design companies overseas and others taking a very entrepreneurial approach by setting up design businesses in New Zealand but with a focus on an export market.”</p>
<p>Students have been working on their final collections as part of the Bachelor of Design in Fashion course, with the announcement of who would show at Rookie made on October 19.</p>
<p>The AUT Rookie show is on November 8 at Shed 15 (Lower Deck), 90 Wellesley St, Auckland’s CBD. Doors open at 6.30pm and the show will start at 7.30pm.</p>
