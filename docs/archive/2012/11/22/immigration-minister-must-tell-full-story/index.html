<p>Immigration Spokesperson</p>
<p>22 November 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Immigration Minister must tell full story</strong></p>
<p>A decision by Immigration New Zealand to keep clients who have had personal details compromised in the dark needs explaining, Labour’s Immigration spokesperson Darien Fenton says.</p>
<p>Figures obtained by Labour show that of 207 people who had private information wrongly released in the last three years, just 12 had been told of the breach.</p>
<p>“Immigration Minister Nathan Guy needs to explain why. For all we know, it could be the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>“Immigration NZ is in the process of developing a Global management database that will be shared around the world.</p>
<p>At the same time staff, already under pressure with their merger into the “super ministry’, MoBIE, are also dealing with fall-out from the Student Visa scandal and questions around off-shore corruption.</p>
<p>“Immigration New Zealand store the personal information of hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom are now permanent residents or here on work visas. The potential for a nightmare of the scale we’ve seen at Work and Income, ACC and Inland Revenue is enormous</p>
<p>“I want to know that Nathan Guy is on top of this. He also needs to assure the New Zealand public he is,” says Darien Fenton.</p>
