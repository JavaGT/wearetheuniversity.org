<p><strong>Wednesday, 14 November 2012, 3:03 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong><br>New Zealand First Leader<br>14 November 2012</p>
<p><strong>Government Fast Tracks Another Immigration Mess</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First says it has caught the Government “red handed” with a dodgy new system of fast tracking visas for members of a major Chinese airline’s frequent flier’s club – despite being warned that international criminals belong to these clubs.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters raised the issue in Parliament, producing confidential Immigration New Zealand papers that show both the Minister and officials had met China Southern Airlines to discuss the proposal.</p>
<p>“This new plan simply means that visas are rubber stamped for Gold and Silver cardholders of China Southern Airline’s frequent flyer club. All the visa requirements are waived.</p>
<p>“It is interesting to note in the proposal that the most important feature for the airline’s clients is to avoid questions relating to financial backing and employment history.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters also produced an internal memo from the Intelligence, Risk and Integrity Division warning that China represents a ”huge set of risks” and suggesting that officials had not learned anything from a recent scandal over student visas.</p>
<p>“This memo also shows that China Southern Airlines compliance over flight passenger lists for checking has been patchy and but for political tolerance the company would have received significant fines.</p>
<p>“This is clearly an abuse of both New Zealand border controls and the visitor visa system and it is being driven directly from the Minister’s office.</p>
<p>“It is disgraceful for the Minister to confirm in Parliament today that he’s prepared to weaken our border security to simply attract a few more tourists.</p>
<p>“Immigration New Zealand is simply carrying out the will of a Government that allows just about anyone and anything into New Zealand. This alarming situation cannot continue,” says Mr Peters.</p>
