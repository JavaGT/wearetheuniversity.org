<p>AUT Business Dean wins Auckland Central Business Leadership Award</p>
<p>Dean of AUT Business School, Dr Geoff Perry has won the Excellence in Business Leadership category at the Westpac Auckland Central Business Awards.</p>
<p>More than 500 people attended the gala ceremony last night to celebrate central Auckland business success. The Awards, presented by Auckland Chamber of Commerce, celebrate excellence in eight areas of business performance – Innovation, Exporting, Service Delivery, Best Emerging Business, Marketing, Business Leadership, Workplace Safety and Retail. This year the Awards attracted 111 entries across all categories.</p>
<p>This was the second year Auckland central businesses had the opportunity to showcase their success after Auckland Chamber of Commerce initiated the awards last year.</p>
<p>Dr Geoff Perry says it’s the first time AUT Business School have entered the prestigious awards and so it’s a real honour to be named as one of the 2012 winners.</p>
<p>“To be recognised for business leadership at AUT Business School is a real highlight,” Dr Perry says.</p>
<p>“As a provider of business education in New Zealand, we are responsible for preparing the next generation of business professionals and leaders – and to ensure that our curriculum, teaching and research is relevant to business. Operating in close collaboration with business and the community is a key priority for us, as is demonstrating our own clear vision and leadership.</p>
