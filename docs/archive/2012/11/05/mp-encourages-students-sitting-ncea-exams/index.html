<p><strong>Media Statement</strong></p>

<p><strong>MP encourages students sitting NCEA exams</strong></p>
<p>National List MP Melissa Lee encourages all local school communities to help NCEA students to aim high.</p>
<p>“We have an education system that is among the best in the world. Four out of five kids are successfully getting the qualifications they need from school to reach their potential, and we must celebrate their success and the professionals and parents who make that possible every day. But our Government’s education plan is about getting five out of five.</p>
<p>“This is why the Government has set a target of 85 per cent of 18 year old school leavers attaining NCEA Level 2, or above, in 2017,” Melissa Lee said.</p>
<p>“In 2011, Mt Albert had 1221 school leavers sitting NCEA Level 2 or above, with 939 attaining it – 77 per cent. To reach 85 per cent our electorate will need an extra 99 students attaining NCEA Level 2. Working together, this is achievable.”</p>
<p>Figures released by the Ministry of Education in September show qualification levels of school leavers have been steadily increasing. In 2011 nationwide school leavers attaining NCEA Level 2 was 72 per cent – up 6 per cent in the last three years.</p>
<p>“With students preparing for NCEA exams, it is a critical time for school communities to support their students. Parents, boards, principals, and teachers will be working together to help their students achieve,” Melissa Lee said.</p>
