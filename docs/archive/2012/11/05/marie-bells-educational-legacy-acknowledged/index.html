<p>5 November 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Marie Bell’s educational legacy acknowledged</strong><br>Education pioneer Dame Marie Bell’s legacy and influence has been acknowledged by the Labour caucus today.</p>
<p>Dr Bell set up Wellington’s Matauranga School in1963 and became Victoria University’s oldest PhD graduate in 2005 at the age of 82. She died on Saturday.</p>
<p>“Dr Bell was an early visionary and champion of the importance of quality early childhood education and the opportunity it held for the professional development of women,´ Labour’s Early Childhood Education spokesperson Sue Moroney said</p>
<p>“She was a foundation member of Parents Centre in the 1950s, during which time she was also actively involved in training kindergarten teachers.</p>
<p>“She never lost her passion for the transformative powers of early childhood education and will be remembered for her work across generations.</p>
<p>“The Labour Caucus had arranged to meet with Marie this week to honour her achievements.</p>
<p>“Sadly, while we never got the chance to do that, she was aware that we were planning to honour her this week and therefore knew how much we valued her huge contribution to generations of children in New Zealand,” said Sue Moroney.</p>
