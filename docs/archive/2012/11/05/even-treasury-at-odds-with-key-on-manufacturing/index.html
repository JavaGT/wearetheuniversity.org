<p><strong>Even Treasury at odds with Key on manufacturing</strong></p>
<p>John Key’s repeated attempts to claim manufacturing is in good heart have been shown up yet again with the Treasury admitting the sector’s performance has been negative for the year, says Labour’s Economic Development spokesperson David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>In the Monthly Economic Indicators the Treasury said: ‘While the [Performance of Manufacturing Index] can be volatile on a monthly basis, it is now showing a negative trend across 2012’.</p>
<p>“John Key has repeatedly denied there are any significant problems with manufacturing in this country. Yet even the Treasury now says manufacturing has been negative this year,” says David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“The head of Treasury Gabriel Makhlouf wants his department to be more attuned to the people. By highlighting the overall negative trend in manufacturing this year Treasury is echoing the views of thousands of people across the country who have lost their jobs in manufacturing.</p>
<p>“John Key has refused to listen to the jobless struggling to get by, the business owners forced to shut down their factories, and opposition parties calling for a cross-party inquiry. Maybe he will listen to the Treasury.</p>
<p>“Instead of making insulting jokes about footballers and red shirts John Key should focus on the real issues facing this country and start with massive problems in manufacturing.”</p>
