<p>UC setting up Student Innovation Centre for smart young entrepreneurs next year</p>
<p>November 7, 2012</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury (UC) is setting up New Zealand’s first Student Innovation Centre next year for smart young entrepreneurs, Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Ian Town said today.</p>
<p>The centre will be launched in February and will be open to students with bright ideas to develop their entrepreneurial skills.</p>
<p>``We wanted to create a special student-led entrepreneurial ecosystem that encourages, develops and inspires innovative and creative business abilities among as many UC students as possible,’’ Professor Town said.</p>
<p>``The centre will offer a unique portfolio of extra-curricular entrepreneurial opportunities for students that complement and enhance the existing innovation opportunities already on offer at UC.</p>
<p>``The centre will host New Zealand’s first specialised hatchery for incubating students’ bright ideas into new commercial and social ventures.’’</p>
<p>The centre will be open for business in the 2013 academic year. It will work closely with existing on-campus activities such as entre, a student-run non-profit company that organises competitions and other events for students who wish to develop their entrepreneurial talents.</p>
<p>Global economies needed innovative and bright people to produce and grow healthy economies and societies. Smart and creative thinkers were the most critical resource, particularly the rapidly growing knowledge-based economy on which New Zealand’s future rests, Professor Town said.</p>

<p>UC was a vital part of Christchurch and Canterbury’s source of knowledge creation and talent. UC already has an enviable reputation for research and innovation.</p>
<p>With the rebuild under way in Christchurch, Professor Town said there was an urgent need to encourage a climate that fostered innovation and entrepreneurship among its student community.</p>
<p>``The long-term payoff is a generation of highly motivated thinkers, a growth of successful local businesses and strongly focused organisations, a healthy economy and vibrant society. As the Lonely Planet travel guide recently said: ‘Christchurch is one of the top ten cities in the world when it comes to excitement and opportunity’,” Professor Town said.</p>
<p>The centre will be run by executive director Dr Chris Kirk and manager Dr Rachel Wright.</p>
