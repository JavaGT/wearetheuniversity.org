<p><strong>Wednesday, 7 November 2012, 4:07 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Louisa Wall<br>MP for Manurewa</p>
<p>7 November 2012</p>
<p><strong>Marriage Bill all about fairness</strong></p>
<p>Labour MP Louisa Wall gave the first public submission on her Marriage Equality (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill today, saying that all New Zealand couples deserve equality under the law.</p>
<p>The Government and Administration Select Committee is now hearing thousands of submissions on the Bill.</p>
<p>“My message to the committee and to New Zealanders today was simple - marriage equality is about fairness and choice. It is about recognising that all couples, regardless of their sex, sexual orientation or gender identity, deserve equality under the law and equal access to the social and civil institution of marriage,” Louisa Wall said.</p>
<p>“We now have an opportunity to have a comprehensive debate about marriage equality. In my introductory submission I chose to debunk some of the arguments put forward in the past few months and to draw attention to the key drivers behind this legislation.</p>
<p>“Fundamentally, this issue is about human rights and highlighting the principles of equality and non-discrimination with consenting adults being able to obtain a marriage licence from the State as equal citizens. How, who and where consenting couples marry is a private matter and my Bill is not concerned with these decisions.</p>
<p>“I reiterated today that churches have nothing to fear from marriage equality. There is no obligation on them to marry any couple against their wishes.</p>
<p>“Marriage equality has drawn broad-based support form a cross-section of New Zealanders and across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>“Today’s select committee session was a robust example of democracy in action. I am confident the committee will ensure a constructive, respectful environment for all submitters.</p>
<p>“I look forward to the debate ahead,” Louisa Wall said.</p>
