<p>David<br>PARKER<br>Spokesperson for Finance</p>
<p>7 November 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Deficit up, National’s credibility down</strong></p>
<p>National’s economic credibility has again been dented with news that the $2.1 billion Government deficit (obegal) for the latest quarter is $450 million worse – 27% - than expected, says Labour’s Finance spokesperson David Parker.</p>
<p>“National’s economy is stagnating. Yesterday’s news was that full-time employment is down. Manufacturing is struggling. Exports are down. That is why the tax take is down.</p>
<p>“Less tax that is a sure sign that businesses aren’t growing and working Kiwis aren’t earning.</p>
<p>“National’s deficit is $450 million worse than expected - they were off by 27 per cent. Their economic credibility is further damaged.</p>
<p>“This should come as no surprise given that National’s main economic initiative for this three years was to sell our state assets, and even that is off the rails.<br>“National is seriously mismanaging the economy. We see the evidence every day. Businesses are being sold overseas or shut down, jobs are being outsourced or cut, and a thousand Kiwis are leaving for Australia every week.</p>
<p>“The only thing that’s growing in this country is the Christchurch rebuild, on the back of tragedy and insurance inflows that even this Government can’t claim credit for.</p>
<p>“John Key promoted himself as the man to run the economy well. The evidence is clear today that his ideas aren’t working.</p>
<p>“Kiwis are realising what a disappointment this Government is.”</p>
