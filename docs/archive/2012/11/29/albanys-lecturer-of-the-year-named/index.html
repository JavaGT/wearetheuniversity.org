<p><strong>Albany’s Lecturer of the Year named</strong></p>
<p>A “maths magician” was named as the Albany Students’ Association 2012 Lecturer of the Year, in an event held at Student Central recently.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Shaun Cooper from the Institute of Information and Mathematical Sciences, College of Sciences received the highest number of votes. Student feedback included his penchant for running to lectures and his ability to make mathematics interesting and fun with clear teaching and inspiring lectures.</p>
<p>The awards, held every year since 2005, are an opportunity for students to comment on their favourite lecturers, and the association’s advocacy coordinator Penny Lyall and her team compiles the best of these comments into the awards presentation each year.</p>
<p>Association president Stephan van Heerden says the Lecturer of the Year Awards are a lot of hard work for the association’s much-diminished team, but incredibly worthwhile.</p>
<p>“It’s a great way to thank the teaching staff for their dedication and commitment to Massey students, and the comments show just how much that hard work is appreciated,” he says.</p>
<p>Ms Lyall says it was great to see a record-breaking number of teaching staff nominated in 2012.</p>
<p>“We had 137 teaching staff nominated this year and when teaching staff hear of their nomination, they’re always delighted and say it sustains their commitment to teaching excellence for the following year.”</p>
<p>The 2012 College Winners are:<br>• Auckland School of Design: Eric Thompson<br>• NZ School of Music: Pete France<br>• College of Business: Dr John Tan – School of Management<br>• College of Education: Emily Jones – Speech &amp; Language Therapy<br>• College of Humanities and Social Sciences: Atsuko Tsukamoto – School of Linguistics and International Languages<br>• College of Sciences: Associate Professor Shaun Cooper – Institute of Information &amp; Mathematical Sciences</p>
<p>In addition to the presentation of certificates and college trophies to lecturers, the Massey University Teaching and Support Award was presented to Ken Cage from the Centre for Teaching and Learning. Along with their certificates all nominees received handmade quill bookmarks crafted from decommissioned library books created by association volunteers.</p>
<p>Traditionally funded by the association, this year additional sponsorship was provided by Massey University, Ti Point Wines, Bennetts Books and the New Zealand School of Music Band. Mr van Heerden says the association is extremely grateful to the sponsors for helping to ensure this much-loved campus event is able to continue.</p>
