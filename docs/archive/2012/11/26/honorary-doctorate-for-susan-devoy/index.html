<p><strong>Monday, 26 November 2012, 11:06 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato">University of Waikato</a></strong></p>
<p>Honorary doctorate for Susan Devoy</p>
<p>Dame Susan Devoy, former world squash champion and community health advocate will receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Waikato next year.</p>
<p>Dame Susan was winner of the British Open Squash title eight times between 1984 and 1992 and was World Champion four times - in the days when world champs were usually held every two years.</p>
<p>She was awarded an MBE at 21 and at 34 was made a Dame Companion of the New Zealand order of Merit.</p>
<p>University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says Dame Susan is a very worthy recipient of an honorary doctorate. “She has achieved in so many different areas, and displays qualities of excellence, energy and commitment and sets herself high standards – all qualities that we encourage in our students. She’s also one of our greatest sportswomen who happens to live and work in the University of Waikato region. ”</p>
<p>Dame Susan spent a decade on the international squash circuit, and when she retired from professional play, returning to New Zealand to start a family, she turned her hand to community work in paid and volunteer positions.</p>
<p>As a player, her grit on the squash court was matched by a determination off court to improve the treatment and pay of women players on the circuit. She brought those same skills into committee and board rooms in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Based in Tauranga and bringing up four sons, Dame Susan has been CEO of Sport Bay of Plenty and a member of the Auckland District Health Board. She is currently a trustee of the Tauranga Energy Trust and a board member of the Health Promotion Agency – an amalgamation of the Health Sponsorship Council and ALAC.</p>

<p>Nationally, her long-service as a trustee of the Halberg Trust has been widely acknowledged; she has supported mental health campaigns, is a patron of the Muscular Dystrophy Association, a board member of the Sustainability Council and most recently has been a trustee for Home of Cycling, supporting the establishment of a new national indoor velodrome in Cambridge.</p>
<p>Dame Susan Devoy’s honorary doctorate will be conferred at the University of Waikato’s graduation ceremony in Tauranga in April 2013.</p>
