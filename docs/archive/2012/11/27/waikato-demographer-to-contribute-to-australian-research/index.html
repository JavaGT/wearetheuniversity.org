<p><strong>University of Waikato demographer to contribute to Australian research</strong><br><strong>on ‘Fourth Age’</strong>  </p>
<p>An authority on ageing and demographics at the University of Waikato is part of a research team awarded Australian Research Council funding for a project which will look at the over-85s – the fastest growing segment of the Australian population.</p>
<p>Professor Natalie Jackson heads the National Institute for Demographic and Economic Analysis (NIDEA), based at the University of Waikato, and is a regular commentator on demographic change in New Zealand and internationally.</p>
<p>She will contribute her expertise to Revisiting the &#39;Fourth Age&#39;: health, socioeconomic and cultural transformation of, and diversity in, Australia&#39;s oldest old population, 1981-2011, which has been awarded a prestigious ARC Discovery Project grant worth AU$192,888.</p>
<p>Professor Jackson will work on the project with Professor Laurie Brown and Dr Binod Nepal of the University of Canberra, and with Professor Helen Bartlett of Monash University.</p>
<p>“The over-85s are what we call the oldest-old, and the changing make-up and experiences of this group needs attention,” says Professor Jackson. “This project will expand the knowledge base about Australia&#39;s oldest old, helping to inform public policy and to improve discussions on what the &#39;Fourth Age&#39; really means in Australia.”</p>
<p>Similar research is being undertaken in New Zealand by NIDEA’s Professor Peggy Koopman-Boyden who is looking at how to enhance the productive participation of New Zealand&#39;s older population.<br>Text here</p>
