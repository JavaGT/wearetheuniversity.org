<p>Su’a William<br>SIO<br>Employment Spokesperson</p>
<p>21 November 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Joyce in a spin over youth unemployment</strong></p>
<p>Steven Joyce is blowing more hot air over youth unemployment today than Mt Tongariro,” says Su’a William Sio.</p>
<p>The Economic Development Minister has claimed today that employers are backing the Government’s initiatives to get young people into work.</p>
<p>“There are currently 85,000 young people not in education, employment or training – that is more than 18,000 more than when National came to power. One in four young people aged 15-19 is unemployed.<br>“If this is Steven Joyce’s idea of success, what would he classify as failure?</p>
<p>“Overwhelmingly employers said what was holding them back from employing young people was a lack of skills. Well, the Government has a woeful record on skills training.</p>
<p>“Under National the number of Modern Apprentices has fallen by almost 20 per cent. Industry training has dropped and 80 per cent of the funding for skills training in Canterbury has not been spent.</p>
<p>“It’s also outrageous for Mr Joyce to state that many employers favour a youth minimum wage – the fact is that just 8 per cent of employers said it was a good idea.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce is in a desperate spin over youth unemployment, but no amount of spin can hide the lack of jobs and training,” says Su’a William Sio.</p>
