<p>Lianne<br>DALZIEL<br>Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson<br>23 November 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Government Must Act To Ease Power Price Pressure</strong></p>
<p>Gerry Brownlee must sit down with Orion soon to get a better deal for Cantabrians than the new plan to impose the network’s $155 million in earthquake costs on households, say Labour’s Canterbury MPs.</p>
<p>“In another blow to Canterbury residents, power prices look set to increase to cover the $155 million price-tag the earthquakes have imposed on the Orion network,” says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Lianne Dalziel.</p>
<p>“There must be some respite for the people of Canterbury. They shouldn’t have to cover the entire cost of the network’s damage.</p>
<p>“Orion seems to have had no other options. Its revenue is down $30 million, its price path is capped until 2015 as a regulated natural monopoly and it has no choice but to repair the lines, poles or cables even though there is no insurance cover to help.</p>
<p>“Gerry Brownlee needs to sit down with the board of Orion and work through the issues. I understand he hasn’t even met with them yet. That’s not good enough.”</p>
<p>Labour MPs are urging the people of Canterbury to make submissions to Orion, but to send a copy to the Minister as well.</p>
<p>“Although the Commerce Commission will ultimately make the decision, it is important that the Government hears what the public has to say,” says Lianne Dalziel.</p>
