<p><strong>Massey Seeks Coach In Residence</strong></p>
<p>Massey University will employ a coach in residence to assist with its sport management and coaching programme and mentor young athletes in the region.</p>
<p>The position, initially for one year beginning in January, is a joint initiative between the University and Sport Manawatu.</p>
<p>School of Sport and Exercise lecturer in sports management Ian O’Boyle says the coach in residence will ideally be a well-respected coach in their chosen sport.</p>
<p>They will join the school’s staff and assist in the delivery of coaching papers.</p>
<p>“The coach in residence will give students looking at going into coaching the ability to learn from someone working in the industry, so they will receive a practical as well as theoretical understanding,” he says. “We envisage them providing advice to students on how they can succeed as elite coaches.”</p>
<p>The role also involves liaising with other high-performance coaches and organising coaching clinics.</p>
<p>The coach will also work with a selection of young athletes from the region. Sport Manawatu chief executive Mike Daisley says this will be a significant benefit to the region’s young sporting talent.</p>
<p>“The wider Manawatu region has been a great breading ground for young talent, and Sport Manawatu actively supports these rising legends and their clubs to ensure this tradition continues,” he says.</p>
<p>“I believe that this position will enhance the efforts of these athletes and their coaches and the position will also benefit the wider coaching community.”</p>
<p>Mr O’Boyle says the position is a 0.4 equivalent full-time role, and the coach in residence will be able to continue in his or her other roles at the same time.</p>
<p>“We are looking for someone who is coaching at the highest level in Manawatu or its surrounding regions who can be the public face of sport coaching at the University,” Mr O’Boyle says.</p>
