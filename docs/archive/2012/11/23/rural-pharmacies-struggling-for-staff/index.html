<p><strong>Rural Pharmacies Struggling for Staff</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First says pharmacists in rural areas are being put through unnecessary stress and anxiety because of inadequate Government policies.</p>
<p>Health spokesperson Barbara Stewart says there is an urgent staffing crisis in rural areas where overworked pharmacists struggle to fill vacancies with recent graduates.</p>
<p>“We urge the Government to add pharmacists to its Voluntary Bonding Scheme (VBS) which currently helps to bring recent medical graduates to hard-to-staff areas.”</p>
<p>In a written question from New Zealand First to the Health Minister it was found that he had ‘no intention to include pharmacy graduates in the VBS’.</p>
<p>Mrs Stewart says this appalling decision means the best quality of pharmacy care will be missing from rural areas which are historically difficult to staff.</p>
<p>“We understand that the existing multi-disciplinary rural immersion health training placement scheme places health students in a rural environment in the Whakatane and Eastern Bay of Plenty areas.</p>
<p>“As a first step, the Government should include pharmacy students in an expanded immersion scheme that would cover all of rural New Zealand.”</p>
<p>Mrs Stewart says New Zealand First would consider adopting a range of measures to ensure the adequate recruitment and retention of health professionals in rural areas.</p>
<p>“This could include student loan abatements, fees reductions, and scholarships so that the rural community is well served while pharmacy graduates get vital work experience.</p>
<p>“It would provide a winning situation for all involved.”  </p>
