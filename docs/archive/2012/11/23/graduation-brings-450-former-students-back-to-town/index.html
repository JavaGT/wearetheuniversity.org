<p><strong>Friday, November 23, 2012</strong><br><strong>Graduation brings 450 former students back to town</strong></p>
<p>More than 450 former Massey students will be capped in two graduation ceremonies next Friday.</p>
<p>Thirty-five students will be conferred with doctoral degrees and 108 will receive master’s degrees.</p>
<p>In total, 454 students, from Massey’s Albany, Wellington and Manawatu campuses as well as distance learners, will graduate in ceremonies at the Regent on Broadway, Palmerston North. After each ceremony graduates will form a procession along Broadway Ave to The Square.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says capping ceremonies are the highlight of the academic year. “It’s a time for graduates to celebrate the hard work they put in and for those who supported them to be acknowledged. Each year I am impressed by the quality of the people who are capped, and equally impressed by the people who support them.”</p>
<p>Social work pioneer Mervyn Hancock and former Reserve Bank governor and executive director designate of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Secretariat Dr Alan Bollard will receive honorary doctorates.</p>
<p>Mr Hancock, from Palmerston North, is regarded as the founder of the modern social work profession in New Zealand. He spearheaded Massey’s Bachelor of Social Work degree, the first at a New Zealand university, was the inaugural director of the social work programme and is a former city councilor.</p>
<p>At the 10am ceremony he will be conferred a Doctor of Literature (honoris causa) in recognition of his pioneering work, his influence on the professionalisation of social work and his outstanding national contribution in the field of social work education.</p>
