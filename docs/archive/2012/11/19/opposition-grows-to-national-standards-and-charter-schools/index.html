<p>Immediate Release</p>
<p><strong>Opposition grows to National Standards and Charter Schools</strong>  </p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa has welcomed the unanimous support of delegates at this weekend’s Labour Party Annual conference to remove National Standards and charter schools.</p>
<p>“Along with other parties such as the Greens and New Zealand First we are seeing a strong and very public rejection of the Government’s current direction in education,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa president, Ian Leckie.</p>
<p>Delegates voted that a Labour-led Government would remove National Standards in reading, writing and maths.</p>
<p>“We know that National Standards do nothing to raise student achievement. Instead, they force schools to narrow the curriculum. Educators know that student-centre learning is more effective in raising achievement. That has been backed by the findings in the ERO’s Priority Learners’ report,” he says.</p>
<p>The Labour Party conference also pledged to end the charter schools experiment saying it would undermine our public education system and the delivery of a diverse and high-quality school system governed by local communities. Delegates also agreed to end public funding to all private schools.</p>
<p>“This overwhelming support among opposition parties in rejecting the Government’s business model for education based on competition, standardisation and test-based accountability is good news for learners, parents and teachers.</p>
<p>“Parents now have a real way of expressing opposition to the current policy and who to support in order to keep and develop our world-beating quality public education system.”</p>
<p>The conference also called for compulsory Te Reo Maori for children up to age 15 and expanding resourcing and professional learning and development for teachers of Te Reo.</p>
<p>&quot;Maori is an official language of New Zealand and Maori culture is a key part of our heritage so it is very important that all New Zealand children have access to good quality teaching in Te Reo,&quot; said Ian Leckie.</p>
