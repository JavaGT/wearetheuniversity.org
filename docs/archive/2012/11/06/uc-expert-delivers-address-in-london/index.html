<p>What the future holds for Christchurch, UC expert delivers address in London</p>
<p>November 6, 2012</p>
<p>Post-earthquake Christchurch was now an extremely dynamic place to live and work, a University of Canterbury lecturer told a conference in London today.</p>
<p>UC lecturer Dr Tom Wilson told an international conference on urban sustainability and resilience at University College London that the Canterbury rebuild was credited with contributing to the South Island’s economy growing at 3.3 percent, the greatest pace of growth seen in eight years.</p>
<p>``We are just seeing the rebuild begin to ramp up. New entertainment venues are popping up. There always seems to be a new bar or cafe opening. We are seeing the emergence of hubs where entertainment venues are beginning to cluster. Each hub has its own particular flavour, giving diversity.</p>
<p>``Domestic and commercial insurance has begun to re-enter the local market - allowing building consents and new home purchases to get back under way. This is a significant development, as it has been a major bottleneck or constraint in the recovery process.</p>
<p>``Shortage of skilled labour is a growing concern, ranging from sourcing/generating the required people through to housing them. There is clarity about the central city developments and a vision of what the central city will look like.</p>
<p>``Lonely Planet has just announced that Christchurch is number six on its list of Top 10 Cities for 2013, describing us as ‘rising from the rubble…with a breath-taking mix of spirit, determination and flair’.’’</p>

<p>Dr Wilson said the University’s enrolments were tracking back at 2010 levels. There were still a significant number of challenges, with on-going issues around what is safe land to use particularly on the Port Hills.</p>
<p>Christchurch was still not seeing transparency in the decision making process to the level communities desire. But this was beginning to change, he said.</p>
<p>Future land use planning priorities had to recognise geological hazards so it could rapidly reconfigure and adjust where development occurred. But they also had to consider the complex social, economic and political demands of the diverse, highly connected, well-established affected communities.</p>
<p>``So far, this process in Christchurch has at times been opaque, top-down and fraught with challenging geotechnical and insurance issues, a perceived lack of community involvement in decisions at times, a perceived lack of transparency and on-going delays,’’ Dr Wilson said.</p>
<p>``But more recently, it has been interesting to watch as many decision making bodies have begun to find the best way going forward has been to involve the community in the decision-making process as genuine partners.</p>
<p>``One cannot help but wonder if one of the great disaster natural hazard land-use planning case studies is playing out before our eyes. Decisions which will shape the way Christchurch will look in 50, 100, maybe 200 years’ time are being made.</p>
<p>``Geologists, engineers, social scientists and planners have a very challenging job to inform these difficult decisions with good data and analysis under very short timeframes with extreme social, political and economic pressure to be robust and be resilient to all possible hazard events in the future.</p>
<p>``Effective and robust risk-based land use planning which was well informed by science and was undertaken as part of normal, day to day urban planning, would have been the most socially and economically efficient risk reduction strategy for making Christchurch city more resilient to natural hazards. There were great examples where this did happen and some tragic instances where it didn&#39;t. The Christchurch experience dramatically highlights that it is too expensive and socially traumatic to get this wrong.</p>
<p>``Finally, the value of well-prepared organisations who can respond effectively, understand the needs of its own people and those in the wider community, communicate and empower its community, is one which can thrive in the aftermath of a disaster. It requires hard work, vision and sustained commitment from dedicated individuals and teams.</p>
<p>``Above all else, it requires unending drive and commitment to be prepared, to invest sufficient time and resources towards planning and practicing for a major event. On a personal level, I&#39;m really enjoying being part of Christchurch. I feel a sense of positive urgency in the recovery process, with significant steps being taken.’’</p>
<p>Dr Wilson will also give talks at Durham and Bristol universities.</p>
