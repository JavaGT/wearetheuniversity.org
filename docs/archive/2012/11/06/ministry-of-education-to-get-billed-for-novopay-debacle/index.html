<p><strong>Ministry of Education to get billed for Novopay debacle</strong></p>
<p>Primary principals are to begin invoicing the Ministry of Education because of the ongoing frustrations over the new Novopay payroll system.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa National Secretary Paul Goulter says the Novopay debacle has been enormously time consuming and has placed a huge amount of stress on many schools.</p>
<p>He says this has resulted in very real costs in extra time and stress for principals and their administration staff.</p>
<p>“It has resulted in literally thousands of wasted hours across the country and has been taking attention away from important things such as teaching and learning.</p>
<p>“We’ve reached the point where principals and support staff are totally fed-up. The Ministry has had two months to sort the problems out. It is clearly not doing enough and has instead been trying to downplay the problems.</p>
<p>“Government policy changes have been placing more and more stress on schools and this is quickly becoming the final straw,” he says.</p>
<p>“The Ministry needs to take responsibility and be more responsive to the concerns of schools.”</p>
<p>He says the Minister of Education, Hekia Parata will also be sent copies of invoices and NZEI Te Riu Roa is hoping that she will show some leadership over this issue.</p>
<p>“We expect that the final bill will run into millions of dollars,” he says.</p>
