<p><strong>Thursday, 15 November 2012, 11:33 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong><br>New Zealand First Leader<br>15 November 2012  </p>
<p><strong>Whanau Ora a Tragedy for Maori And Taxpayers</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First says the latest report into Whanau Ora confirms it is wasting millions of taxpayer dollars on a scheme which provides little more than money for family reunions.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters says the <em>Findings of the Developmental Evaluation of the Whanau Ora Integration, Innovation and Engagement (WIIE) Fund</em> report is largely indecipherable.</p>
<p>“In that regard it’s just like the ill-conceived Whanau Ora which is a touchy-feely scheme which ignores the real plight of Maori.</p>
<p>“Struggling Maori families need help in vital areas such as health, education, housing and employment, not taxpayer funding for rugby games and sausage sizzles.</p>
<p>“Whanau Ora is a tragedy for both taxpayers and Maori.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says the report was written by an organisation sympathetic to the Whanau Ora ideology, but it still identified alarming deficiencies with the scheme.</p>
<p>“There is no basic data available on participation levels, and glaring monitoring gaps on where millions of taxpayer dollars are going.</p>
<p>“The report would have called for Whanau Ora to be scrapped had it been conducted by a truly independent organisation,” says Mr Peters.  </p>
