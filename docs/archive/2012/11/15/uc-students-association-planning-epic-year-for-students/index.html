<p><strong>UC Students Association planning epic year for students in 2013</strong></p>
<p><strong>November 15, 2012</strong></p>
<p>University of Canterbury students can expect an epic 2013 on campus after what has been a challenging year for Christchurch and the University, University of Canterbury Students Association (UCSA) president Erin Jackson said today.</p>
<p>She said the overall feedback from University of Canterbury (UC) students is that they have really enjoyed 2012 and are looking forward to moving ahead in 2013.</p>
<p>``Things are different and changing, but that’s part of what makes this an exciting place to be. We’ve begun planning for Orientation next year and I can only say that it looks set to be brilliant.</p>
<p>``2012 has showcased the best of the student experience at UC; the campus heart, through redevelopment and remediation, has been a hive of activity throughout the year. We’ve had live performances, free lunches, paddling pools and gaming machines through to interesting key note speakers.</p>
<p>``The UCSA strives to create belonging and ownership on campus, and throughout 2012 this has been apparent; balancing the fun and social environment with hosting student forums, the students of UC have been well and truly involved this year.</p>
<p>``Part of what has made this possible is the opening up of new spaces; as well as the Foundry and the Shilling Club. The Undercroft social area has been integral in helping the UCSA achieve its goals. A multi-purpose space that students can use to either study, socialise or meet, it has come a long way from its history as a bicycle storage location.’’</p>

<p>Jackson said UC students were involved with a whole host of initiatives. Many students demonstrated their continuing volunteering ethos with the Volunteer Army Foundation’s project, The Concert, by volunteering four hours of their time for a ticket to an all-day music festival with top Kiwi artists.</p>
<p>She said in among the academic study there was some fairly significant procrastination. The UCSA Facebook page hit over 10,000 “likes” and generated over 24 million impressions (every time that the page is viewed or utilised).</p>
<p>``For us, that means that we know we’ve got a pretty connected student body. Our clubs and societies have seen a record number of 25,000 memberships. We have hosted 160 events across the year. That’s one event, every day of every academic term. In addition we put on phenomenal events such as Orientation, Winterlude, Graduation Ball and our famous annual Tea Party.</p>
<p>``With the opening of The Shilling Club and also The Foundry we have had several options to have a drink on campus. Both of these spaces have been well utilised over the past months, with students loving having a ‘home’ on campus again.</p>
<p>``UC Students were also recognised for their work with the Student Volunteer Army through being awarded the Anzac of the Year award. This was an incredibly special award, and was the first time that it had been presented to a civilian organisation,’’ Jackson said.</p>
