<p>Tracey Martin MP<br>Spokesperson for Education<br>17 October 2012</p>
<p>Parents Rights Abused by Charter School Laws</p>
<p>The Government is eliminating parents’ right to information about their child’s education through the seriously flawed Education Amendment Bill, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says the Bill makes a double-pronged attack by removing Charter Schools – now disingenuously renamed Partnerships Schools – from having to release information under the Official Information and Ombudsman acts.</p>
<p>“If a student is expelled from a state school the parent or caregiver can seek a review of the Board of Trustee’s decision through the Ombudsman’s Office. That right will be removed at Charter Schools.</p>
<p>“The double whammy comes with these schools also not being covered by the Official Information Act.</p>
<p>“These underhand tactics will allow these schools to get rid of students for any reason without recourse for affected families.”</p>
<p>Ms Martin says the Bill will also see the Government abdicate its responsibility to build new Early Childhood Education Centres.</p>
<p>“Instead it will allow private developers to lease Crown land to build centres which will in turn be leased to private service providers.</p>
<p>“These private companies will essentially be lining their own pockets with taxpayer’s childcare subsidy money,” says Ms Martin.</p>
