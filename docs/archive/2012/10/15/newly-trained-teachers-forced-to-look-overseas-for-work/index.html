<p><strong>Newly Trained Teachers Forced To Look Overseas For Work</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First warns that hundreds of newly trained teachers will be forced to find jobs overseas when they qualify from University at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says the Government has spent millions on attracting new teachers to training schools but has failed to create enough jobs to employ them.</p>
<p>“Primary teaching students were recently told by an Education Ministry official to head overseas as there are no teaching jobs in New Zealand for the majority of them.”</p>
<p>Ms Martin says the ministry official went on to advise the young graduates to return in 10 years when a mass teacher retirement may happen.</p>
<p>“For recently qualified teachers to be told to wait a decade before seeking a job in New Zealand is disgraceful.</p>
<p>“The Government’s lack of focus on creating jobs will simply see them join the mass Kiwi exodus to Australia so they can start their careers with good jobs on great pay rates.”</p>
