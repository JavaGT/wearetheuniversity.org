<p><strong>Students frustrated with further fee increases</strong></p>
<p>Students have expressed their frustration at the decision being taken by University of Auckland Council’s to raise fees by the maximum 4%. For many students, this amounts to an increase of several hundred dollars for their 2013 fees. The fee increase means that student fees have increased by the maximum level for the past five years.</p>
<p>“What we’re seeing with these increases is the failure of central government to properly support our universities” said Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA) President, Arena Williams. “While universities are struggling to keep their heads above water in a dynamic global environment, government funding is stalling. Instead, they are being told to squeeze more money out of students. If New Zealand wants to continue to be a world leader in education, government has to come to the party.”</p>
<p>The average increase in tuition subsidies from the government this year was 1.2%, while for some courses, such as Arts and Commerce, it was 0%. The effective increase in University costs was 3.7%. Meanwhile, the University of Auckland’s ranking on global measures, such as the Times Higher Education Supplement and QS Rankings, continues to fall, as does the long-term rankings of all other New Zealand universities.</p>
<p>“Increasing fees has a real effect on those trying to enter the tertiary education system,” said Nate Amato-Ali, President-elect of Auckland University Pacific Island Students’ Association (AUPISA). “This is particularly true when the government has restricted access to student support for many students, including postgraduates, solo parents and recent migrants. A system that allows these fee increases is shutting out those who have the potential to do well, but can’t afford to.”</p>

<p>AUSA has called on the University of Auckland to send a clear message to the Minister for Tertiary Education Steven Joyce that relentless year-on-year fee increases are unsustainable. “Universities can’t keep passing the buck to students. New Zealanders have always prided themselves on a world-class tertiary education system that gives everyone a fair go. If that’s what we want, we need to see more support from the government”, Williams said.</p>
