<p>15 October 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Train teachers for Kiwi classrooms</strong></p>
<p>Student teachers need to know they have a future in Kiwi classrooms, says Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson, Grant Robertson.</p>
<p>A Ministry of Education representative reportedly told Victoria University teaching diploma students they should head overseas, as there would only be jobs in New Zealand for one-in-five of them.</p>
<p>“That’s a terrible indictment on the Ministry of Education. What message is the Ministry sending to the next generation of teachers?</p>
<p>“This Government is already exporting a thousand New Zealanders a week. It is absolutely crazy to invest in training world-class teachers and then tell them they don’t have a future here.</p>
<p>“This is further evidence that the Government has lost its way in education. They have failed to properly plan tor teacher supply, which is a basic task.</p>
<p>“Instead they are leaving students with large loans and travel tips for Australia. It’s just not good enough,” says Grant Robertson.</p>
<p>Labour’s Education spokesperson, Nanaia Mahuta says the Government has taken a hands-off approach to teacher supply and demand issues, giving no signals to training providers about the serious gaps in important subject areas.</p>
<p>“The Government’s entire attitude towards teachers is one of barely concealed contempt. Hekia Parata’s arrogant disregard for teachers was clear when she addressed the PPTA recently.</p>
<p>“This Government doesn’t value teachers, and its indifference now clearly extends to student teachers too,” says Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
