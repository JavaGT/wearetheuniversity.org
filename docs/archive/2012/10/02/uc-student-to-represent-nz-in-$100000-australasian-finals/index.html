<p><strong>UC student Pip Widdon to represent New Zealand in $100,000 Australasian finals</strong></p>
<p>October 2, 2012</p>
<p>University of Canterbury student Pip Widdon will represent New Zealand in the $100,000 CPA Big Break Dragon’s Den style tertiary business competition final in Melbourne tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Widdon won the NZ event from 144 teams and she is up against 5 Australian finalists. The winning team or individual will receive $20,000 for themselves and $50,000 for their university.</p>
<p>UC accounting lecturer and MBA director Tony Mortensen said today Widdon’s chance to compete in the finals represented not only a great win for Widdon who had put in a tremendous amount of work but also a positive result for UC and New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;Given she also beat so many teams from New Zealand and Australian universities to get to the final reinforces the idea that we grow some real talent in this country.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe we have to make sure we support up and coming professionals like Pip so we can create a more efficient and productive economy in the future. With people like Pip on our case I’m sure our future looks bright. Quite a number of students from UC go on to have stellar accounting and management careers and I believe this is a result of the high calibre of teaching staff,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The competition is organised by one of the world’s largest accounting bodies CPA Australia and was run for the first time in New Zealand this year and included many Australia entrants. The event challenges undergraduates to get a head-start in their careers.</p>

<p>Widdon said she would present a business report to the judges tomorrow night to allow the Make-A-Wish Foundation to develop a sustainable business model.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m developing a sustainable business plan so donations and sponsorship can be increased so more terminally ill children can receive a Make-A-Wish experience. I&#39;m looking forward to the opportunity to visit Melbourne as well as present to the NZ and Australian CEO&#39;s of Make-A-Wish which is a significant reward in itself.&quot;</p>
<p>Widdon said her preparation had involved developing an understanding of the charities sector in both countries which had been interesting because of the huge differences between countries and charities.</p>
<p>The CPA Big Break project has given Widdon an opportunity to solve real world business problems that might be facing a non-for profit organisation.</p>
