<p><strong>UC chemistry students to be taught by an industry leader in 2013</strong></p>
<p><strong>October 30, 2012</strong>  </p>
<p>Chemistry students at the University of Canterbury (UC) will have the opportunity to be taught by a national industry leader in 2013.</p>
<p>Dr Peter Surman, the global research and development manager from Douglas Pharmaceuticals, will teach third and fourth year UC chemistry students as well as teaching into the chemistry PhD programme.</p>
<p>Dr Surman will visit the chemistry department in May 2013 for a concentrated series of lectures, seminars and workshops.</p>
<p>He said building connections with tertiary institutions helped Douglas to attract talented graduates and to date their out-reach to Canterbury had been limited.</p>
<p>``This is also an opportunity to meet with academic staff in the UC physical sciences,” he said.</p>
<p>Chemistry lecturer Dr Sarah Masters said Dr Surman’s commitment to UC was great news for chemistry students.</p>
<p>``He has wide-ranging experience in industry, from roles in developing and marketing and company start-up to his current senior management experience. He will bring extensive knowledge of these areas to our students and will be a source of inspiration as they think about further study and potential careers in industry, broadening their horizons as to possible career pathways.”</p>
<p>Dr Surman’s visit is part of the Futureintech VIP initiative supported by the Institution of Professional Engineers and funded by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise to promote careers in technology, science and engineering.</p>

<p>Dr Surman spoke earlier this year at the New Zealand Association of Scientists conference in Wellington giving a talk on why PhD graduates were vital to the future growth of New Zealand’s industry.</p>
