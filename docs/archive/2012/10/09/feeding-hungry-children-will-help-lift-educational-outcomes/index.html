<p>Immediate Release</p>
<p>Feeding hungry children will help lift educational outcomes</p>
<p>The Government needs to tackle child poverty if it wants to improve student outcomes.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa National President Ian Leckie says it is extraordinary that the Government cannot find $2.6 million to extend the fruit in schools programme yet is able to spend many times that amount on untried, untested and ropey National Standards.</p>
<p>“We know that poverty is one of the leading causes of student underachievement. If the Government is serious about lifting student achievement it would do something about child poverty.”</p>
<p>“Instead it seems intent on wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on implementing policies that will not improve education and that research has shown will have a detrimental affect on poor and struggling children.”</p>
<p>“As a school principal I know that children who are hungry and undernourished do not learn as well as those who come school well fed.”</p>
<p>“This is a shocking indictment of an uncaring policy. The Government needs to get its priorities right and start investing in all children.”</p>
