<p><strong>Otago appoints two new Professors of Management</strong></p>
<p>The University of Otago has appointed two new Professors of Management whose research and teaching has a strong international focus.</p>
<p>André Everett was previously an Associate Professor of International Management in Otago Business School’s Department of Management while Elizabeth Rose is currently a Professor of International Business at Finland’s Aalto University School of Business. Professor Rose will take up her position in February 2013.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne says she is very pleased that the University has appointed the pair to their positions within the Department of Management.</p>
<p>“Both are excellent scholars who have made important international contributions in advancing research and teaching in their fields,” she says.</p>
<p>Otago Business School Dean Professor George Benwell says that these two new senior appointments are a welcome addition to the School’s body of staff already engaged in world-class business education and research.</p>
<p>“In their new positions they are well-placed to lead research relevant to boosting New Zealand business growth and internationalisation and also to impart their expertise to new generations of business and public sector leaders and entrepreneurs,” he says.</p>
<p><strong>Professor André Everett</strong></p>
<p>After studying at universities in Germany, Iceland, and the United States, André Everett earned a doctorate at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, subsequently taking up a teaching position on Otago’s MBA programme for six years. He joined the Department of Management in 1998.</p>

<p>His teaching specialties are international and strategic management, with research interests including knowledge management, internationalisation of management philosophies, evolution of management strategies, and cultural influences on international business leadership (with a particular interest in China). He is an Adjunct Professor at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan and has held visiting professorships in Europe, South America and Israel.</p>
<p>Professor Everett’s writings on international and operations management strategy have been published or presented in over 30 countries, and he has taught in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Chile, China, France, Israel, New Zealand, and the USA. He supervises several doctoral and Master’s students in international and strategic management.</p>
<p>He is a member of the Academy of Management, Academy of International Business, Decision Sciences Institute, Pan-Pacific Business Association, Production and Operations Management Society and several New Zealand societies. He is on the editorial advisory or review boards of seven international journals and has reviewed for around 40 others.</p>
<p>Professor Everett says his teaching will continue to range broadly within international business, and more narrowly within international strategic management, China, Asia, New Zealand-international business relations, intercultural communication, differences in leadership across cultures, and management of expatriates.</p>
<p>“International business ethics is also an area of increasing interest to me,” he says.</p>
<p>Within Dunedin as well as in China, one of his major research foci is “clusters” (otherwise known as “industrial districts”); e.g. the Dunedin engineering and education clusters and the China china (porcelain) cluster.</p>
<p><strong>Professor Elizabeth Rose</strong></p>
<p>Professor Elizabeth Rose has previously held appointments in both the US and New Zealand. She has a Bachelor’s degree from Princeton University and did her postgraduate work, including a PhD in Business Administration, the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>Her core research interests relate to global strategy and internationalisation. She has a long-standing interest in the Japanese business context, and emerging interests that include the globalisation strategies of small and medium-sized firms and service-sector internationalisation.</p>
<p>Professor Rose’s work has been published in a variety of prestigious international journals. Her international profile and research productivity have also led to appointments to the editorial review boards of some of her field’s top journals.</p>
<p>She plays active roles in a variety of international academic associations including her current position on the board of the Academy of International Business as Vice-President for Administration. She is also on the board of the Strategic Management Society’s Global Strategy Interest group, and is past president of both the Association of Japanese Business Studies and the Australia and New Zealand International Business Academy.</p>
<p>Professor Rose says she is delighted to be joining Otago Business School.</p>
<p>“The University’s values, in terms of excellence in research and teaching, and the importance of being an active member of an academic community, represent an excellent fit with my own priorities,” Professor Rose says.</p>
<p>She says she is looking forward to exploring the many connections between her research interests and those of my new colleagues, and developing fruitful collaborations.</p>
<p>“Dunedin’s entrepreneurial business environment presents wonderful research opportunities, in terms of learning more about how small firms view the prospect of expanding internationally and how to help them take that step, which provides so many options for growth.”  </p>
