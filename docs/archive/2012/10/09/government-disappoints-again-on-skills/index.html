<p><strong>Tuesday, 9 October 2012, 1:42 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Grant<br>ROBERTSON<br>Tertiary Education, Skills and Training Spokesperson<br>Megan<br>WOODS<br>Youth Affairs Spokesperson<br>9 October 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Government disappoints again on skills</strong></p>
<p>Labour says the Government’s plans for a &quot;hub&quot; to help Canterbury employers find skilled workers is too little and too late.</p>
<p>&quot;Once again the Government is promising big, and failing to deliver,” Labour’s Tertiary Education Skills and Training spokesperson, Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>“A hub such as this may be a useful coordinating mechanism, but the bottom line is that we should have started the process of creating a skilled workforce for the Christchurch rebuild long before now.</p>
<p>“The Government has been far too slow in its support of the training opportunities that would have done that, with latest available figures showing it has only spent $7 million of the $42 million allocated for skills training.</p>
<p>“It has let the people of Canterbury down by its hands off, she’ll be right approach,” said Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>Labour’s Youth Affairs spokesperson, Megan Woods, said while skills brokers seconded to the hub would help with some employment opportunities, Cantabrians were frustrated with the lack of any real action: “Many have expressed disappointment that the Government is not listening to them.”</p>
<p>She said her member’s bill to implement Labour&#39;s policy to convert the dole for 18 and 19 year olds into a subsidy for apprenticeships was one practical way to increase skills and help young people into long-term work.</p>
<p>“If the Government truly wants to give young people a stake in our future, then it needs to back the bill,” Megan Woods said.</p>
