<p><strong>Tuesday, 9 October 2012, 12:04 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/OUSA">OUSA</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Otago Student Earnings up 25%</strong></p>
<p>The latest figures from student association governed Student Job Search show that the free service has got Otago students into jobs that has led to a 25% increase in Otago student earnings over the past two years.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s great news to see that students who are balancing study and their bank balance have earned more over the past two years,&quot; said Logan Edgar, OUSA President. &quot;It shows Otago student earnings are outperforming inflation which is a great sign as it shows Otago students are worth their weight in gold, well maybe blue and gold in our case.&quot;</p>
<p>SJS figures show that in 2010 students earned NZD $3,349,530. That figure ballooned to NZD $3,889,317 in 2011 and rose another 9% to 4,234,467 in 2012.</p>
<p>&quot;The service is getting more and more students signing up each year, and the figures show that when they&#39;re placed they&#39;re worth it because they&#39;re both earning and working more,&quot; said Edgar. &quot;I encourage anyone looking to employ an extra staff member, to look at the free service SJS provides. It&#39;s not just about the money, it&#39;s about experience and helping give students a taste of the real world.&quot;</p>
