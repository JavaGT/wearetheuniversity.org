<p>UC student intern documenting red zone residents’ emotional stories</p>
<p>October 1, 2012</p>
<p>Many of the heart-broken red zone people of Christchurch who have been ordered to leave their homes, communities and suburbs because of the earthquakes are telling their stories to the University of Canterbury (UC).</p>
<p>The red zone communities of Bexley, Dallington, Horseshoe Lake and QEII will soon disappear from the face of Christchurch forever. A UC arts intern Shihana Shahabdeen is documenting residents’ feelings and views before they disperse.</p>
<p>As well as useful research the information including photos will be stored with the UC earthquake digital archive in coordination with the National Library in Wellington. An exhibition of their stories is planned for next year.</p>
<p>Shahabdeen said it had been a moving experience talking the red zoners, many of whom were elderly and deeply upset at the prospect of leaving homes and streets they have spent most of their lives in.</p>
<p>``They are mostly frustrated with being split up from their community and having to leave everything behind to start afresh elsewhere in the city. It’s the idea behind adjusting to a new lifestyle post-quake that is most difficult for them to cope with.</p>
<p>``These residents have spent most of their lives residing in their suburbs and having to watch their house being demolished and being told to leave has only added to their list of post-quake worries.</p>
<p>``Leaving their homes and community has taken a profound toll on these red zone residents. Most of their homes are fairly brand new, and having to leave them is very upsetting.</p>

<p>``Bexley and Dallington, in particular, are very tight-knit communities, and the residents are extremely saddened at the prospect of being separated from one another. But being given another chance to live life to the fullest is something they aren’t complaining about.’’</p>
<p>Nearly all red zoned residents were angry about having to leave. One woman interviewed felt grieved at the prospect of leaving a home she had built from scratch with her own bare hands. She was heart-broken that all her hard work would now be demolished right in front of her eyes.</p>
<p>Shahabdeen said many residents who had recently been asked to move were past the point of anger and were saddened to leave a place they once called home and to watching their hard work being demolished was heart-wrenching. Some were too distraught to watch their memories come crashing down in front of their eyes.</p>
<p>``I think that’s what has had a significant effect upon the residents. As most of them are quite elderly, they are quite sensitive in regards to their home and community. They feel very emotionally connected to the people and the place and having to leave their homes have broken many of the connections formed.</p>
<p>``The earthquakes have physically limited the residents to continue with some of their hobbies. Many feel that they are too scared to go about their daily activities post-earthquake period. Some have even told me that they can’t progress with their hobbies such as painting.</p>
<p>``This was because of the emotional stress that the quake had created. Many residents have physically restricted themselves to the own property where they felt more secure.’’</p>
<p>``These people are mostly annoyed at CERA, EQC, the insurers, the city council and the government. Their frustration is really clear. They express disappointment and anger when referring to the progress and status of their homes.</p>
<p>``It’s the slow, dragging and ongoing saga with the insurers and EQC that have really got fire steaming out of their nostrils. They are facing ongoing, never-ending phone calls to the insurance companies which have lasted months, if not years.’’</p>
<p>The communities had gelled as one to support one another during times of need. The elderly mostly required emotional assistance to deal with the earthquakes. And the support surrounding the communities, had been fantastic, Shahabdeen said.<br>ends</p>
