<p>1 October 2012</p>
<p>Floral Notes premieres at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts</p>
<p>Actress and playwright Geraldine Brophy’s new play Floral Notes is premiering in Hamilton next week. It’s a play about two penpals whose lives are enriched when their childhood friendship is rekindled.</p>
<p>Floral Notes is Brophy’s eleventh produced work along and includes music from a song book adapted by Jane Keller, and both women are starring in the two-person show.</p>
<p>The play follows the lives of two women, Iris and Rosemary, who were pen pals as young girls but lost touch years ago. Iris now lives in New York with a peculiar family and leads a busy urban life. Rosemary owns a large lifestyle property, living off the land in small town New Zealand. Through a twist of fate they re-kindle their friendship and Rosemary offers to help Iris transform her New York apartment rooftop into a garden paradise – via email.</p>
<p>It’s Geraldine Brophy’s first foray into the musical genre. Jane Keller has sourced the music which features songs by some of the great 20th century composers.</p>
<p>Floral Notes is directed by Emma Kinane, and the accompaniment will be by pianist Michael Nicholas Williams. “It’s a fabulous play,” says Ms Kinane. “It’s a warm and touching story about new friendships and new beginnings.”<br>The production is being presented by the Central North Island Arts Consortium, supported by funding from Creative New Zealand.</p>
<p>It takes place on 6 October at 7.30pm at the Playhouse Theatre in the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts at the University of Waikato<br>Tickets can be purchases at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts or at Ticketek outlets. Adults tickets $35.</p>
