<p>AUSA Politics Week</p>
<p>Every year the Auckland University Students Association invites MPs and organisations onto campus for a week of debates, discussion and deliberation.</p>
<p>&quot;Politics Week 2012 will actually be one to remember,” said University of Auckland student Sarah R Thompson, 19. “There are events for all people along the political spectrum, and a huge variety of contemporary and controversial issues to be discussed. I for one am really excited, as hopefully it will serve to engage the largely politically disinterested Auckland Student Body.&quot;</p>
<p>Politics Week will be held this week from the 1st to the 5th of October. All events are easily accessible for students in the City Campus.</p>
<p>There are over twenty events in a single week. Highlights this year include a Marriage Equality debate between MP Louisa Wall and Colin Craig and a “Mini Back Benches” with Wallace Chapman at our very own Shadows Bar. Students can also expect a variety of stalls, including free food from a ‘kiwi’ barbeque in the quad and fair-trade coffee from Oxfam.</p>
<p>“This year AUSA tried really hard to reach out to as many students as possible. It is also amazing the contribution and unique ideas which I have received from clubs,” said Max Lin, National Affairs Officer of the Auckland University Students Association.</p>
<p>This year not only external groups are involved but our own clubs have a very strong presence.</p>
<p>“Amnesty on campus is doing a workshop, Red Cross NZ is promoting their campaign Make Nuclear Weapons the Target, and the Sustainability Network has a vegan lunch and documentary. Every major political party in New Zealand is also involved in some way. Students and clubs are making this their week.”</p>

<p>The week will also be visited by a long list of MPs, including MP David Cunliffe, MP Nikki Kaye and MP Jacinda Ardern, who will all come on campus to meet students and do their own presentations.</p>
<p>There is also an international focus, including a protest condemning the human rights abuses in Syria and another against the unjustified imprisonment of Pussy Riot in Russia.</p>
<p>The week begins at 10am on the Monday 1st of October, where all the stalls go up in the quad.</p>
