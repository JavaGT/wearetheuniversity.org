<p><strong>How can New Zealand move up the value curve?</strong></p>
<p>The former head of the UK Design Council, David Kester, will address how New Zealand can use design to create more valuable products and services, and generate higher returns, when he meets leading figures in business, design, regional and economic development during a packed visit to this country in early November.</p>
<p>Over a ten-year period as Design Council Chief Executive (2003 to June 2012), Mr Kester led the development of ground-breaking business support and innovation programmes, coaching start-ups and high-tech ventures in the manufacturing and science sectors, and accelerating innovation in the fields of healthcare and crime prevention. This year, his projects have included new prototypes in the field of dementia care and assisted living, as well as the launch of the Olympic torch designed by Barber Osgerby.</p>
<p>Mr Kester’s visit has been secured by Massey University’s College of Creative Arts, as part of its Value of Design project. This research project is examining how both the private and public sectors can use design to shift New Zealand up the value curve, and stimulate greater innovation. Mr Kester will be sharing his experience on successful ways in which design has been used in Britain.</p>
<p>“A growing body of international evidence shows that design can significantly boost the performance of firms, improve the efficiency and quality of public services, and help address big societal and environmental issues,” says the Pro Vice-Chancellor for the College of Creative Arts, Associate Professor Claire Robinson. “The UK Design Council has been instrumental in much of this research. Under David’s leadership, the council became the single most effective advocate for design in the world. We are very lucky to have his input into our Value of Design project”.</p>

<p>In Auckland, Mr Kester will meet senior figures in science, innovation, business, regional economic development, design and tertiary education. His engagements in Wellington include a meeting with senior state sector executives hosted by the State Services Commission, and participation in Massey’s BLOW Creative Arts Festival. In Christchurch, Mr Kester will look at design for the city rebuild.</p>
<p>The visit is supported by Massey University, the British Council, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Auckland University of Technology, Colenso BBDO and the Designers Institute of New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>Public talk: Design and the power to transform</strong><br>Good design provides human-centered solutions to hard-to-solve problems. In the UK design-led projects have reduced violence and aggression in hospital A&amp;E departments, made built environments safer and easier to live in, reduced the level of infection in hospitals, and improved water use. So is design the cure-all for the challenges of the 21st century?</p>
<p>Hear David Kester, former head of the UK Design Council, talk about the power of design to transform communities and public services.</p>
<p>11am, Sunday 11 November 2012, Soundings Theatre, Te Papa, Wellington. Free entry.</p>
