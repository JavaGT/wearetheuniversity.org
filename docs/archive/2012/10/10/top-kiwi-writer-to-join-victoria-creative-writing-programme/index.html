<p><strong>Top Kiwi Writer To Join Victoria’s Creative Writing Programme</strong></p>
<p>One of New Zealand’s most celebrated contemporary writers, Emily Perkins, is joining Victoria University’s International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML).</p>
<p>Taking up a sought-after role to teach creative writing to Master’s students, Emily will replace Damien Wilkins, who will head up the IIML when Professor Bill Manhire retires in January next year.</p>
<p>Damien says that the depth Emily will bring to the role is very impressive. “Emily is a supremely gifted communicator, and has an international reputation as a novelist. She is also a wonderful teacher—so this is very exciting for us, and for our students.”</p>
<p>The IIML’s Master of Arts in Creative Writing is very highly regarded, and applications to take part in the programme are received from aspiring writers all over the world. A maximum of 30 students are accepted each year.</p>
<p>Emily says that she feels honoured to be taking up the position. “Wellington has always had a place in my heart, it’s where I began my writing life and I’m really looking forward to joining this community.”</p>
<p>The role of Senior Lecturer attracted a very strong field of applicants. “Jobs like this very rarely come up, and the calibre of people who applied was incredible,” says Damien.</p>
<p>Emily will take up the role in February next year.</p>
<p>Emily Perkins is the author of four novels, including <em>The Forrests</em> and a collection of short stories, <em>Not Her Real Name</em>. She will be moving to Wellington from Auckland with her husband and three children.</p>
