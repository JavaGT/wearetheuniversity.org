<p>10 October 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>Don’t make Christchurch kids charter school guinea pigs</p>
<p>Parents and students in Christchurch have every right to be worried about the Government using the education recovery process to experiment with privitised education and charter schools on them, Labour&#39;s Associate Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>This morning the Christchurch Press revealed that one of Hekia Parata&#39;s relatives is moving ahead with plans to open a new &#39;special character&#39; school offering Maori immersion education. At the same time, seven out of the ten existing state schools offering Maori immersion education are earmarked for closure or merger.</p>
<p>&quot;People I speak to in Christchurch are rightly worried that the Government seems to be &#39;clearing the decks&#39; for charter schools.</p>
<p>“Hekia Parata&#39;s potential conflict of interest extends well beyond approving or declining her relative’s charter school application. So many of the other decisions she is making will have a direct impact on the number of kids it might be able to enrol.</p>
<p>&quot;Recovery from the earthquakes must not be used as an excuse to privatise Christchurch education. Charter schools are untested, won&#39;t have to employ a full complement of qualified teachers, and won&#39;t have to teach the same curriculum as public schools.</p>
<p>&quot;Charter schools are an ideological experiment. The students of Christchurch have been through enough in the last two years. They don&#39;t deserve to be made guinea pigs as well,&quot; Chris Hipkins said.</p>
