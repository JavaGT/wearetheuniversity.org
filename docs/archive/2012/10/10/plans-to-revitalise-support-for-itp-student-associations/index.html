<p>Media Release – NZUSA – 10 October 2012</p>
<p>Plans to revitalise support for ITP student associations</p>
<p>Through working with its ITP sector council the NZ Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) is committed to revitalising support for student associations at Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics.</p>
<p>A new direction agreed at the NZUSA’s Congress meeting on 6 October includes bringing as many ITP student associations as possible together for a dedicated summit in early 2013, to be focused solely on issues that are confronting students in the ITP sector.</p>
<p>Shannon Pennefather, current president of the Students’ Association at Unitec (USU), was elected to lead this phase of supporting the associations that are currently struggling to survive, and to formulate ways to help rebuild the student voice through developing associations at campuses where there are none.</p>
<p>“I am personally very committed to getting a handle on the issues that are facing smaller, regional polytechnics around the country to understand their needs and to build stronger links amongst the ITP sector.</p>
<p>“Overall I am very optimistic about this challenge because it will be an opportunity to ensure that the often overlooked needs and concerns of polytechnic students are more fully represented, and the role of tertiary institutions in our sector better understood,” says Pennefather.</p>
<p>“In recent years more than 40% of all students receiving tertiary education attended polytechnics. This diverse group of students, including the high number of parents and Maori and Pacific people engaging with higher with higher education for the first time, deserve a distinct voice.</p>

<p>“The ITP sector plays a fundamental role in producing the skilled workforce highlighted in the government’s latest growth agenda report this week. Put simply the targets for delivering a skilled workforce depend on the role played by the ITP sector and the quality of the education it provides.</p>
<p>“I look forward to speaking up more on behalf of students and the ITP sector as a Vice-President of NZUSA in 2013”.</p>
