<p><strong><em>For immediate release</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Presidents Win University Council Positions</strong></p>
<p>The Otago University Students&#39; Association is proud to announce that student representation will stay strong on the Otago University Council next year as both the current OUSA President, Logan Edgar, and the OUSA President elect, Francisco Hernandez, were voted into the student representation positions after elections this week.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re stoked because we take a very different approach, but we both have the same focus on delivering the best services and education for students.&quot; Said Logan Edgar, OUSA President, &quot;Students pay to get a superior education at Otago, we&#39;re there to make sure they get that, and can enjoy the ultimate student experience while they do so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Logan is a consumate communicator and brings great experience to the role having already given an enormous amount of time and value to Otago students.&quot; Said Francisco Hernandez, OUSA President Elect.</p>
<p>&quot;Fran has served on the OUSA for two years now so has a great knowledge of OUSA and will spearhead social justice issues, his fresh ideas will be of great value to the University Council next year.&quot; Said Edgar, &quot;We work together well and our skills will compliment each other nicely, roll on 2013!&quot;</p>
<p>Otago University Council elections were held from the 8th-10th of October for the two student representation positions.</p>
