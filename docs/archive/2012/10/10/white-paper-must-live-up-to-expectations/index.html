<p><strong>Jacinda<br>ARDERN</strong><br>Social Development Spokesperson<br>Spokesperson for Children<br>10 October 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>White Paper Must Live Up To Expectations</strong></p>
<p>If Paula Bennett’s White Paper on Vulnerable Children is to have a real and long-lasting impact it must acknowledge and address the issues around child poverty in New Zealand, Labour’s Social Development spokesperson and Spokesperson for Children Jacinda Ardern says.</p>
<p>The document is being released tomorrow at child abuse prevention network, Jigsaw’s, annual conference.</p>
<p>“Thousands of people have put a huge amount of time and energy into being a part of this process and expectations are high. I genuinely hope that the Minister demonstrates their views have been heard.</p>
<p>“We know the impact child poverty is having on health and education, so it surely must form the cornerstone of any paper seeking to address vulnerability.</p>
<p>“We also know things are at crisis point. At least 270,000 Kiwi children are living in poverty and, based on figures released by Ms Bennett to a select committee, need across families has increased massively in just the last few years.</p>
<p>“That’s reflected in the shameful rise in the number emergency food grants being accessed – up from 285,460 in the year to June 2008 to 553,854 at June 2011.</p>
<p>“People asking for help don’t do it for fun. They do it out of desperation.</p>
<p>“To make matters worse Ms Bennett has refused to acknowledge failings in the current process means families with immediate need are reportedly having to wait up to two weeks before receiving a grant.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow provides an opportunity to address some dire immediate and longer term issues to help our kids.</p>
<p>“I hope it&#39;s an opportunity not lost on Ms Bennett,” said Jacinda Ardern.</p>
