<p>Kiwirail Blunders Behind Gisborne - Napier Rail Link Closure</p>
<p>New Zealand First says KiwiRail’s expensive blunders over the Cook Strait ferry Aratere, buying cheap China-made locomotives, and importing dodgy Peruvian sleepers contributed to the closure of the Gisborne-Napier rail link.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters says the East Coast is a highly productive export region and even the management of KiwiRail knows the best way to transport bulk goods is by rail but finances are tight because of financial mistakes made.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still problems with the Aratere after it was lengthened in Singapore at great expense.</p>
<p>“Then KiwiRail had to buy the ship at more expense and it is still causing problems and costing money.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says the financial cost of buying China-made locomotives that weren’t fit for purpose, and the importation of thousands of Peruvian sleepers riddled with foreign fungi, were also significant factors in the closure of the rail link.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to work out that the millions wasted on the Aratere, cheap locomotives, and dodgy Peruvian sleepers could have been used to keep the rail link alive.</p>
<p>“The cost of saving the line is just a fraction of the bungles KiwiRail have engaged in.</p>
<p>&quot;Add to this the frenzy of cost cutting and restructuring and you have mayhem which can be traced back to the management of KiwiRail.</p>
<p>“It isn’t the Gisborne - Napier line that should be going. It is KiwiRail chief executive Jim Quinn,” says Mr Peters.</p>
