<p>Raymond<br>HUO<br>Export Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>3 October 12 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Members Bill will give export education a boost</strong></p>
<p>A new Members Bill aimed at raising the quality of export education and boosting its international image provides an opportunity for New Zealand to become a leading player in the sector, Labour’s Export Education spokesperson Raymond Huo says.</p>
<p>“While the $2.3 billion export education sector may be viewed as a successful industry, a small number of rogue private training establishments are ruining New Zealand’s reputation internationally.</p>
<p>“Many countries have strict guidelines as to how education providers profile themselves with international, national or regional titles reserved for reputable providers whose names match their status.</p>
<p>“However, in New Zealand there is minimal regulation for the naming rights of PTEs. Therefore providers that boast regional or national titles are attractive to international students despite the fact they may be ill-equipped and operating out of sub-standard facilities.</p>
<p>“My Private Members Bill, the Education (Naming of Private Training Establishments) Amendment Bill, will nip that in the bud by ensuring profiles of PTEs reflect the size and quality of the provider.</p>
<p>“Some of these students are future New Zealanders. If we want to attract the best students and become a world-leader in export education then we need to get it right from scratch.</p>
<p>“This Bill will ensure that,” Raymond Huo said.</p>
