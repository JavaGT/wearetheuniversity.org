<p>Media Release<br>2 October 2012<br><em>- for immediate release</em></p>
<p><strong>Market day grows</strong></p>
<p>After just five months of operation the Telford Market Day has proven a great success; growing from just 17 vendors in May to a whopping 32 last month. The market, which follows in the tradition of so-called farmers markets springing up throughout the country, owes its success to increasing support from local community as well as enthused tourists travelling the scenic highway.</p>
<p>The market is a not-for-profit venture and takes place on the third Sunday of every month at the covered equine area of Telford’s campus, just 6kms from Balclutha.</p>
<p>“So far it has included sellers of various types of produce, antiques, wood, preserves, plants and jewellery,” says Telford Director, Charley Lamb. “The success of the event has also meant that October’s market will include recycling services of such items as plastic bags, horticultural pots and egg cartons. We are also hoping in the Summer months the market will include fruit produce from Central Otago.”</p>
<p>The Market Day provides a great opportunity for people to promote and sell their wares; however, it’s not all about commerce. The day also includes such things as face painting, pony rides and, at times, a bouncy castle for the kids.</p>
