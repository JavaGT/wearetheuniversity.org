<p>National Standards site should be pulled</p>
<p>The Government’s National Standards website should be pulled down following revelations nearly half of all assessments were marked incorrectly, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>A sample of results monitored by the Education Ministry has found 49 per cent of writing assessments were marked incorrectly and accuracy in relation to maths ranged from 18 to 90 per cent.</p>
<p>“The results are wrong and the site publishing them should immediately come down,” Green Party education spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minster has already described the results as ‘ropey’, and this proves they’re a tangled mess.</p>
<p>“Children are being written off as failures and schools are being judged based on this data. They are effectively being defamed by the Government’s National Standards website and it has to be brought down.</p>
<p>“It is common for information to be pulled from public websites when it has been proven to be wrong and that should happen here.</p>
<p>“Parents deserve good quality information about their schools and the Green Party is talking with parents, students and the education sector about ways to ensure they get it,” Ms Delahunty said.<br>ends</p>
