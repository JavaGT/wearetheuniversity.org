<p>UC student Pip Widdon recognised with award in Australasian business final</p>
<p>October 4, 2012</p>
<p>University of Canterbury student Pip Widdon won the creativity and innovation award representing New Zealand in the $100,000 CPA Big Break Dragon’s Den style tertiary business competition final in Melbourne last night.</p>
<p>Judges said she delivered a slick presentation that was well researched and addressed the key issues.</p>
<p>``It was an amazing experience and great to be recognised. I’ve learnt a lot,’’ Widdon said from Melbourne today.</p>
<p>Widdon won the NZ event from 144 teams. UC accounting lecturer and MBA director Tony Mortensen said Widdon had put in a tremendous amount of work.</p>
<p>The competition was organised by one of the world’s largest accounting bodies CPA Australia and was run for the first time in New Zealand this year and included many Australia entrants. The event challenges undergraduates to get a head-start in their careers.</p>
<p>Widdon said presented her case to judges last night to allow the Make-A-Wish Foundation to become a sustainable not-for profit organisation.</p>
<p>She said the CPA Big Break project gave her a chance to solve real world business problems that might be facing not-for profit organisations.</p>
