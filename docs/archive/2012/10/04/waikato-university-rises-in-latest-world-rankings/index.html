<p><strong>Waikato University Rises In Latest World Rankings</strong></p>
<p>The latest set of world rankings released today has seen the University of Waikato at its highest ranking ever.</p>
<p>The 2012-2013 UK-based Times Higher Education rankings of the world’s universities puts Waikato at 302, up from 318 last year.</p>
<p>University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says the new ranking of 302 for Waikato is a solid achievement.</p>
<p>“We are an excellent university that regularly does well in these all-important rankings. As we look ahead to celebrating 50 years since our 1964 founding, it is pleasing to see all our hard work gaining international recognition.</p>
<p>“As a relatively young university we are competing very strongly with universities that have had hundreds of years to establish their international reputations.”</p>
<p>The rankings are based on teaching, research, citations, industry outcome/innovation and international outlook.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato has climbed 16 places in the latest world rankings, more than any other New Zealand university.</p>
<p>In June this year, the THE ranked Waikato University top in New Zealand and seventh in the southern hemisphere of universities under 50 years old. Waikato placed 58th out of 100 universities yet to mark their 50th anniversaries.</p>
<p>Professor Crawford says the university has come a long way in its first 50 years due to the excellence of its staff. “If you consider that the Times Higher Education is reviewing about 5000 universities around the world, this is a strong endorsement of the work Waikato staff are doing to deliver internationally benchmarked and highly regarded teaching and research.”</p>
<p>He says Waikato University is on a journey to be one of the best universities in the world. “The rankings released today are proof that we are well down the path to achieving our goal.”</p>
