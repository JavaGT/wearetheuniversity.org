<p><strong>Andrew Williams MP</strong><br>Spokesperson for Local Government<br>4 October 2012</p>
<p><strong>National to Ram Anti-Democratic Bill through Parliament</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First says our democracy is under serious threat through National’s intention to ram through changes to the Local Government Act.</p>
<p>“This is against the wishes of the majority of the public and the overwhelming sentiment of 775 written submissions and 186 oral submissions on the Bill,” says Local Government spokesperson Andrew Williams.</p>
<p>“The changes will give the Government the power to move into local governing authorities and replace them with hand-picked crown managers and commissioners, and to suspend local body elections.</p>
<p>“It poses a direct threat to the important second tier of democracy in our country and could mean that local councils end up being run exclusively by those that support the government of the day – not by those elected by voters.</p>
<p>“It stands out a mile that National is endeavouring to replicate exactly what they have done in Canterbury when they sacked elected Environment Canterbury officials and replaced them with commissioners.</p>
<p>“Watch out New Zealand because the same draconian measures are coming to your community if this Government has its way.</p>
<p>“Local Government Minister David Carter has been out and about recently telling people the Bill will go through regardless of the submissions received and the strong opposition to many aspects of the Bill.</p>
<p>“His comments are totally out of order when this process is still at Select Committee level, and where Parliament has yet to fully debate the legislation.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First’s policy has always been to have the public decide these sorts of issues through the use of referendum and community buy-in.</p>
<p>“We are putting Mr Carter on notice that we will do all we can to stop this unacceptable attack on New Zealand’s democracy,” says Mr Williams.  </p>
