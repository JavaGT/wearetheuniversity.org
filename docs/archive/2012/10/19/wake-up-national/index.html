<p><strong>Friday, 19 October 2012, 11:59 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>David Parker</p>
<p>Finance Spokesperson</p>
<p>19 October 2012  </p>
<p>Wake up National</p>
<p>&quot;When will it stop? The total number of New Zealanders who have given up on New Zealand and headed for Oz under National is now over 170,000. That&#39;s more than the total population of Hamilton, or for a South Island comparison, that&#39;s more than Dunedin and Invercargill combined,” says David Parker.</p>
<p>“New Zealand cannot afford to continue to lose skilled workers every week to Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;The latest migration data shows that 53,729 people departed for Australia in the year to September 2012 – with 21,589 (40%) of those aged between 18 and 30. 3,714 people left in September alone.</p>
<p>“John Key and Bill English have had four years to deliver on their promise to bridge the wage gap and stem the flow. They have failed.</p>
<p>&quot;After the equivalent of Hamilton, or Dunedin plus Invercargill combined, have left the flow of young New Zealanders must slow down sometime, and National will try to call that success.</p>
<p>&quot;National must wake up and do something. Selling our power companies is not the answer.</p>
<p>&quot;National is in denial about the shrinking of the non-primary manufacturing sector. National is in denial about unemployment. Unemployment, especially youth unemployment, is far too high - even after those 170,000 have left.</p>
<p>&quot;John Key has no credible plan to create enough jobs with decent wages.</p>
<p>“While National might be happy to sit by and watch idly as thousands leave for Australia, Labour isn’t.</p>
<p>“As David Shearer outlined in his speech yesterday, Labour has a plan for a high-skill, high-wage, modern economy. Labour will give people hope for a better future at home in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Labour’s plan will create decent jobs and better opportunities so that people know they can get ahead here in New Zealand,” says David Parker.</p>
