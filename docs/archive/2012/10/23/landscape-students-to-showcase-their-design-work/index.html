<p>- for immediate release</p>
<p>Landscape students to showcase their design work</p>
<p>Lincoln University fourth year landscape architecture students will be holding their annual design exhibition at the Re:START mall from Thursday 25 to Saturday 27 October 2012. Open to the public, the exhibition will showcase their work with a focus on resilient design and practice for locations throughout Christchurch and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The exhibition, entitled ‘Hatched’ will showcase 22 students’ major design projects, created for locations around Christchurch but also for other places in New Zealand including Kaikohe, Kaikoura and Wanganui. These major design projects are the landscape design equivalent of an honours dissertation. The students need to do fully developed designs – from concept to design – for a complex site of their choosing.</p>
<p>As part of the students course work, they are required to organise an exhibition of their work, as well present their major designs projects to fellow students, staff and industry leaders.</p>
<p>“The fourth year students are responsible for organising the exhibition, including sponsorship, marketing, production of design sheets and producing a catalogue,” says Lincoln University’s Head of the School of Landscape Architecture, Dr Jacky Bowring. “Having to organise an exhibition provides the students with real-world experience, which is invaluable as they transition to professional employment.”</p>
<p>Under the guidance of Tutor, Louise Bailey, the students nominate a project manager and then form various committees with specific responsibilities to ensure the exhibition is a success.</p>

<p>Project manager Charlotte Murphy is looking forward to showcasing the designs to the public. “We’ve all worked extremely hard in our final year at Lincoln University and we are looking forward to showing the public the design concepts.</p>
<p>“The exhibition is open to the public at the Re:START mall in Cashel Street, from 10.00am to 4.00pm for those three days. The students will be on hand to speak to the public about their work. Our goal is to inspire people about how we design our landscapes, whether in our backyards, towns, cities or rural areas.</p>
