<p><strong>Kiwis Mourn The Loss Of Sir Wilson Whineray</strong></p>
<p>Labour has extended its sincere sympathy to the family and friends of Sir Wilson Whineray, who passed away yesterday.</p>
<p>“Sir Wilson was a true Kiwi icon. He led from the front whether it was rugby, business or serving the community. He was an inspiration to all New Zealanders and he will be missed.</p>
<p>“I’d like to express my condolences to all those who knew Sir Wilson as they come to terms with his loss,” said David Shearer.</p>
<p>Labour’s spokesperson for sport and recreation Louisa Wall says Sir Wilson was a true leader, both as a sportsperson and as a contributor to sport well after his retirement.</p>
<p>“As the longest serving captain of the All Blacks, he led the team through a number of successful campaigns and deservedly was named Sportsman of the Year in 1965.</p>
<p>“Notably, Sir Wilson continued his involvement in sport after his playing days ended as the Chairman of the Hillary Commission and as patron of the New Zealand Rugby Union.</p>
<p>“Sir Wilson successfully transferred his sports leadership into the business arena when he retired from playing rugby and was awarded a Harkness Scholarship to obtain an MBA from Harvard University.</p>
<p>“He has been incredibly successful in the business sector and his standing as an international leader was recognised by the IRB in his induction as the first New Zealander into the Hall of Fame in 2005.</p>
<p>&quot;This legacy to both sports and business bears testament to his true qualities of leadership. I will remember him as an outstanding New Zealander who served his country and his family with passion, pride and an unyielding integrity. He will not be forgotten and he will be greatly missed,” said Louisa Wall.</p>
