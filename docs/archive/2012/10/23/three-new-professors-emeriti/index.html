<p>Three new professors emeriti</p>
<p>The Massey University Council has conferred the title of Professor Emeritus on three recently retired academics – psychiatrist Sir Mason Durie, psychologist Dr Ian Evans and historian Dr Margaret Tennant.</p>
<p>Sir Mason retired in June after 24 years at Massey, the last 10 as Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Mäori and Pasikifa). From 2009 he was also the Deputy Vice-Chancellor.</p>
<p>Professor Evans also retired in June. He joined Massey&#39;s School of Psychology in 2002 after an established career in the United States. He headed the school from 2003-07 and has an international reputation for his research achievements.</p>
<p>Professor Tennant retired at the end of last year. She was a student at Massey and has worked at the university for most of her career since 1978. Much of her research has focussed on women&#39;s history and the history of social policy policy. She was appointed to a chair in history in 2002 and Dean of the Graduate Research School in 2007.</p>
