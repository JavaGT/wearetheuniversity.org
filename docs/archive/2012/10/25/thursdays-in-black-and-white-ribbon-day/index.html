<p><strong>Thursdays in Black and White Ribbon Day</strong></p>
<p>Tertiary students at campuses around Aotearoa are being reminded this week of the tradition associated with Thursdays in Black .– a day when people across the globe wear black as a personal and public protest against gender-based violence and discrimination.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s involvement in the campaign is headed by the Tertiary Women’s Focus Group (TWFG) and New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA)</p>
<p>“With the study year drawing to a close for many students, this is an opportune time for appreciating the unique context presented by campus life, a stage of life when young men and women encounter and experience the challenges of gender equality at another formative level as maturing adults. It is a time to reflect on the hard-fought and unending struggle for women’s rights,” says Ta’ase Vaoga, NZUSA National Women’s Rights Officer, and spokesperson for TWFG.</p>
<p>“Thursdays in Black has always been a symbolic and highly visible way to raise awareness of a struggle that is truly international. It puts a strong focus on ways for individuals to challenge attitudes that condone a culture of rape and violence. It reinforces at both a personal and public level there is something wrong with a world that will allow anyone’s fundamental human rights to be abused and threatened.”</p>
<p>Ms Vaoga notes this week’s Thursdays in Black falls one calendar month before the similarly motivated White Ribbon campaign.</p>

<p>“The White Ribbon campaign, an initiative coordinated by the Families Commission, is in many ways a close counterpart to Thursdays in Black. It is heartening to see the growing number of White Ribbon male ambassadors who are encouraging all New Zealanders, other men in particular, to be part of the solution to ending historically endemic violence towards women.</p>
<p>Ms Vaoga acknowledges NZUSA President Pete Hodkinson, a staunch supporter of reviving Thursdays in Black, will be amongst the White Ribbon ambassadors when nationwide activities peak on 24-25 November.</p>
<p>“Having a student leader who is involved in the fight against gender-based violence helps add another role model to a huge section of society that has to step up and take responsibility. We encourage all male students to take the time to appreciate everything they have learnt about gender equality this year, to continually and honestly examine their own behaviours and to take the White Ribbon pledge to never commit, condone or remain silent about violence towards women.</p>
<p>“Between this Thursday and the end of November if you wear some black clothing as well as wearing a White Ribbon you’ll be showing solidarity with all victims of violence and discrimination”.</p>
