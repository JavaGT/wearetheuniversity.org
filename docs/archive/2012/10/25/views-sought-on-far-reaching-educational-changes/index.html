<p>Nanaia<br>MAHUTA<br>Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>25 October 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Views Sought On Far-Reaching Educational Changes</strong></p>
<p>Labour is calling on parents and communities to stand-up for their children and their local schools as the Government tries to ram through its charter school agenda.</p>
<p>“We are concerned that National’s charter schools will not have to be accountable to parents or students, and that as they will be run at a profit will be competing for funding with state schools - to the detriment of quality education,” Labour’s Education spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta said.</p>
<p>“While there is little evidence to show charter schools lead to improved student outcomes, US research shows just 17 per cent of charter schools did better than public schools. Thirty seven per cent did worse and 46 per cent of charter school showed no significant improvement in students’ learning.</p>
<p>“That hardly bodes well for our kids. Nor does the fact the Government is intent on introducing unregistered teachers into charter schools, something else that can compromise the quality of learning and achievement.”</p>
<p>Ms Mahuta said the Education and Science Select Committee had sought an extended submission period to give organisations, educational leaders, parents, academics and the PTE sector an opportunity to put their views. .</p>
<p>“The closing date is now January 24 and we would urge everyone interested in the future of education in New Zealand to voice their opinions.”</p>

It also allows principals and teachers to search and confiscate students&#39; personal property such as cell phones.</p>
