<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong></p>

<p><strong>Victoria University scoops 12 Marsden grants</strong></p>
<p>Victoria University researchers have scooped 12 prestigious Marsden grants, enabling them to progress their research in a wide range of areas.</p>
<p>The Marsden Fund supports research excellence, allowing New Zealand’s best researchers to explore ideas at the very forefront of their disciplines. Victoria researchers received 12 out of 86 grants funded nationwide, worth $6.75 million in total. The funding consists of eight standard grants and four Fast Start grants for emerging researchers.</p>
<p>Successful projects include research into the adaptability of corals to climate change, differing attitudes to blue- and white-collar offending, motivation and achievement in education and the way that changes in land ownership have shaped the histories of New Zealand and other Pacific countries, compared to the Americas.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh is delighted with the result. “The Marsden grant process is a highly competitive one, and the successful Victoria researchers should be very proud.</p>
<p>“The University prides itself on its ground-breaking and highly relevant research, research which creates new knowledge for the benefit of society.”</p>
<p>The Marsden grants were spread across six University faculties: with six for Science, two for Humanities and Social Sciences, and one each for Education, Engineering, Law and the Victoria Business School.</p>
<p>“It’s excellent to see the grants spread across six of our faculties, including eight schools and one research centre—showing the diversity and breadth of the research being carried out,” says Professor Walsh.</p>
