<p>25 October<br>Immediate Release</p>
<p><strong>Controversial Charter Schools Experiment To Be Debated</strong>  </p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa believes charter schools are an unnecessary and dangerous experiment which will not help children and their learning.</p>
<p>A debate on controversial charter schools will take place in Christchurch on Monday, 29 October.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa believes that Christchurch is being used as a template for the charter schools experiment which has failed internationally.</p>
<p>One of the speakers, NZEI National Secretary Paul Goulter will talk about the experience of charter schools, particularly in Canada, the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>“There has never been a shred of evidence internationally that charter schools lift the achievement of disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p>“Evidence we have, suggests the opposite. In the United States, special needs students are under-represented in charter school enrolments, and are over-represented in expulsions and attrition figures and 40 percent of Afro American students drop out of KIPP schools (an American charter school chain) by year nine.</p>
<p>“And what do the pro-Charter Schools groups say? They say: ‘why don’t you just give them a go?’”</p>
<p>Amendments to the Education Act to allow for the introduction of charter schools have been introduced to Parliament. Submissions to the Education and Science select committee close on January 24.</p>
<p>Also on the panel will be: Nanaia Mahuta, Labour spokesperson on Education, Jacqui Duncan, Principal of Cashmere Primary School and Catherine Isaac leader of the Charter School Working Group.</p>
<p>The evening will be mc’d by Port Hills Member of Parliament Ruth Dyson.</p>
<p><strong>Debate on charter schools, Monday, 29 October, Top West Lounge, Woolston Club, Hargood St, Woolston, 7-8.30pm.</strong></p>
<p>ENDS</p>
