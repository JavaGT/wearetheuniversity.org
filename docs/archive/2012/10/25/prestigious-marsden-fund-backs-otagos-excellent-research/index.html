<p><strong>Prestigious Marsden Fund backs Otago’s excellent research</strong></p>
<p>University of Otago researchers have gained more than $15M in new government funding for 22 world-class research projects at the frontiers of knowledge in their fields.</p>
<p>Their innovative projects are being supported through the Royal Society of New Zealand-administered Marsden Fund, which is regarded as a hallmark of excellence that allows New Zealand’s best researchers to explore their ideas. For the eighth successive year, Otago researchers have gained the largest share of funding available through this annual round.</p>
<p>Researchers from across the University’s four divisions of Commerce, Health Sciences, Humanities and Sciences will lead the new projects, which include 15 standard projects and seven ‘Fast-Start’ projects designed to support outstanding researchers early in their careers.</p>
<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research &amp; Enterprise) Professor Richard Blaikie warmly congratulated Otago’s successful applicants in the highly competitive annual round, which saw only 7.7% of the 1113 preliminary proposals nationally eventually securing funding.</p>
<p>“I am delighted that the world-class quality of all these Otago research proposals has been recognised by the Marsden funding panels. The number of Fast-Starts is particularly pleasing as these up-and-coming researchers are set to be among the University’s future research leaders,” Professor Blaikie says.</p>

<p>The 22 projects address a diverse range of topics, reflecting the breadth and depth of Otago’s research, he says.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University’s Departments of Anatomy, Biochemistry, Economics, English, Geography, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Marine Science, Philosophy, Physics, Physiology, Psychology, Women’s and Children’s Health, and Zoology will lead projects.</p>
<p>“Their research initiatives seek to generate important new insights regarding fundamental questions in areas spanning much of the realm of human knowledge. In many cases, these researchers are also working towards tangible outcomes that promise to bring benefits to New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“For example, one project aims to work towards a better understanding of the Universe’s geometry, while another involves gaining insights into how city-dwelling children can best be supported to develop and maintain their connections with nature to improve their health and well-being.”</p>
<p>One project will delve into the fascinating properties of ultra-cold atoms, while several others are aimed at paving the way for quantum computing, invisibility cloaking, and several tantalising nanotechnologies to become realities. A number of projects involve clarifying various key aspects of plant, animal and human fertility and reproduction, while others seek to advance basic biomedical knowledge in areas such breast cancer and bone health.</p>
<p>Several projects involve gaining an improved understanding of brain anatomy, physiology or neural circuitry. One of these will investigate whether chronic stress causes serious brain function deficits in bees and may play a role in the disturbing world-wide phenomenon of honeybee colony collapse disorder.</p>
<p>Developing computer models to estimate the power able to be generated from arrays of tidal turbines in locations such as Cook Strait is also among the projects, as is an attempt to discover what may be behind several types of pay gaps in New Zealand. A further two projects aim to provide new insights into past cultures in Asia and Europe respectively, while another explores a new mathematical approach to resolving logical paradoxes in philosophical theories.</p>
