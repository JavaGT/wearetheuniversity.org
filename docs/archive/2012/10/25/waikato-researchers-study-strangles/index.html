<p>25 October 2012<br>Waikato researchers study strangles</p>
<p>Two University of Waikato researchers are working to come up with a faster way to detect strangles in horses.</p>
<p>Biological scientist Dr Ray Cursons and his Master of Science student and technician Olivia Patty have been trialling a molecular diagnostic method, which would help diagnose the infection faster.</p>
<p>Horse strangles is one of the most contagious diseases in horses worldwide. It’s characterised by abscesses in the neck that cause lymph nodes to become inflamed. The surrounding tissue becomes swollen and in very severe cases can strangle the airways of affected horses coining the name strangles.</p>
<p>They received a grant from the New Zealand Equine Research Foundation to develop a polymerase chain reaction (a molecular diagnostic method) that decreases the amount of time required for getting the results back and increases the accuracy.</p>
<p>“We work with a number of veterinarians who, when they suspect a horse has strangles, will take a sample and send it on to us and we examine the DNA.</p>
<p>“Hopefully what we are working on will provide a faster, more sensitive, diagnostic technique for the benefit of vets, breeders and owners,” says Patty.</p>
<p>A quicker diagnostic will benefit all horse owners due to the contagious nature of the disease and reduce treatment and quarantine requirements.</p>
<p>This study also identified two novel strains of the strangles causative agent and as a result, they received another grant to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccines available against these two strains of horse strangles unique to New Zealand.</p>
<p>“This work should help determine the best regime, with regards to the vaccines and New Zealand strains, for preventing disease and producing long term protection against disease.”</p>
<p>Direct contact between horses is the most common way that strangles is spread, but it can also be spread by contaminated equipment, improperly cleaned and shared buckets and stalls.</p>
