<p>Bill an attack on public education</p>
<p>The Government’s Education Amendment Bill is an attack on public education and will hurt vulnerable children, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>“The bill legislates for profit-making charter schools to operate at a level of secrecy unprecedented in the education sector,” Green Party education spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said.</p>
<p>Charter schools can expel students without allowing parents any recourse through the ombudsman, and will not have to provide the information other schools have to under the OIA.</p>
<p>“The Education Minster talks about her aim for schools to be accountable and transparent, but this legislation is the polar opposite.</p>
<p>“This Bill undermines our hugely successful public education system, allowing profit making schools to operate with untrained teachers and none of the normal checks and balances imposed on a school, and it lets profit making preschools set up on Ministry land.</p>
<p>“Charter schools are an enormously expensive, and frighteningly dangerous, experiment to solve a problem that doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>“Quite simply, they are the result of a dodgy deal between the Government and a one-man-band party whose agenda is to privatise education.</p>
<p>“I hope all MPs stand up to oppose this attack on our schools,” Ms Delahunty said.</p>
