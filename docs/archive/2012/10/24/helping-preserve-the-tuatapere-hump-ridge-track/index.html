<p><strong>Wednesday, 24 October 2012, 12:08 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Helping preserve the Tuatapere Hump Ridge Track</strong></p>
<p>Victoria University is set to sign an agreement with the Tuatapere Hump Track Board, to develop a joint research programme into tourism, ecology and community development in the region.</p>
<p>The Tuatapere Hump Ridge Track, in Fiordland, is a 55km, three-day loop walk that takes trampers along the south coast of New Zealand, up to the sub-alpine zone of the Hump Ridge, and over historic viaducts in the heart of native forest.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, Victoria University will offer two summer scholarships each year to senior students who will live in the area and carry out research on the track for 10 weeks, with the results of the research to be used by the Hump Track Board.</p>
<p>The University will also offer one undergraduate entry scholarship each year to a student from the Waiau Valley area, who wishes to study tourism, ecology or another closely related field.</p>
<p>Professor Neil Quigley, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) at Victoria University, says he was impressed with the community spirit that led to the creation of the track, and happy to be able to support the region going forward.</p>
<p>“The Hump Ridge Track is located in such stunning setting, and research into fields such as predator control and tourism management in the area will help safeguard it into the future.</p>
<p>“We’re also pleased to offer a new scholarship to local students, giving them the opportunity to come to Victoria and study in areas key to the ongoing preservation of the region.”</p>

<p>Stewart Weir, Chairman of the Tuatapere Hump Track Board, agrees. “We are looking forward to this new partnership with Victoria University, and the benefits it will bring to the Hump Ridge Track and the Tuatapere region.&quot;</p>
<p>Ali King, who manages the track along with his wife Trish, says he is excited about working with Victoria University. “It’s interesting how a casual conversation at Port Craig has grown into something special that will really benefit the Tuatapere Hump Ridge Track, as well as communities in the wider surrounding area.”</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Hon Bill English, MP for Southland, will attend the signing of the agreement, being held on Friday 2 November. Also attending are Southland District Council Mayor Frana Cardno as well as Victoria University and Tuatapere Hump Ridge Track representatives.</p>
<p>The Tuatapere Hump Ridge Track is a private walk, operated by a community based Charitable Trust. The highlight of the track is a loop at the top of the Hump Ridge range, which winds around soaring limestone tors, and offers panoramic views of south-west Fiordland, the Southern Ocean, and Stewart Island.</p>
<p><strong>Event details</strong><br>Media and members of the public are welcome to attend the ceremony, which will be held at the Tuatapere Hump Ridge Track Office from 2.30pm, Friday 2 November.</p>
