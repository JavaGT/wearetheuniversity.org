<p>11 October<br>Immediate Release</p>
<p><strong>How many more ambulances can fit at the bottom of the cliff?</strong></p>
<p>(Reissued Press Release with corrections)</p>
<p>The government has yet again missed a golden opportunity to tackle child poverty.</p>
<p>“Instead of looking at the real issue – poverty – the Government has virtually ignored the many excellent submissions it received on the Green Paper for Vulnerable Children and yet again gone down the road of punishment and monitoring. A road that leads to another ambulance at the bottom of the cliff,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa past president Frances Nelson.</p>
<p>Social Development Minister Paula Bennett today released the White Paper for Vulnerable Children which made various recommendations, including a new database identifying at-risk children which would be accessible to a number of agencies and professionals, including schools.</p>
<p>In its submission on the Green Paper, NZEI supported multi-agency information sharing for at-risk children but says the Government has not gone far enough to protect children from poverty – the main reason for student underachievement in our schools.</p>
<p>&quot;We know that poverty is one of the leading causes of student underachievement. If the Government is serious about lifting student achievement it would do something about child poverty.&quot;<br>At least 270,000 Kiwi children are living in poverty and there has been a rise in the number of emergency food grants being accessed – up from 285,460 in the year to June 2008 to 553,854 at June 2011.</p>
<p>“Poor health, hungry children, low wages, lack of jobs and damp housing affect kids wellbeing and their ability to learn. There is still a lack of pathways out of poverty and opportunities, such as this, are constantly missed. Just recently, for example, the government refused to extend the fruit in schools programme.</p>
<p>“We must give credit to our teachers and public education system in that vulnerable children do as well as they do at school and in early childhood education,” says Frances Nelson.</p>
<p>The White Paper says teachers, other professionals and frontline staff will need “training, tools and times” to “support good decision-making” in the new information sharing environment.</p>
<p>“We hope that the Ministry will engage meaningfully with the education sector in order to discuss and implement this.’’</p>
