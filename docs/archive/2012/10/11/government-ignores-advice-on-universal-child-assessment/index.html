<p>Government ignores advice on universal child assessment</p>
<p>A ‘tool’ that has identified children of beneficiaries at risk of being abused should be applied to all children if it’s a solution to keeping kids safe from maltreatment, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>As part of its Children’s Action Plan the Government announced a new predictive screening tool that could help identify children at risk of being abused, in many cases before they are even born.</p>
<p>“Background papers reveal the tool had so far only been used for screening children whose parents had been on a benefit. The papers also show that the academics who devised the tool recommend it be applied to every child in the country at the time of birth,” Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said.</p>
<p>“Nothing in the White Paper indicates that the Government has plans to apply the tool to all children born in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The Green Party needs more information about how the Government plans to use the tool before endorsing its use, but the Government risks turning a blind eye to the thousands of non-beneficiary children at risk of abuse if it has no plans to use it to screen all children.</p>
<p>“The White Paper itself talks about how, unless support mechanisms are universal, they will not pick up on all at risk children as most don’t wave a red flag to identify themselves.</p>
<p>“That’s why so many submitters on the Green Paper agreed with Plunket’s recommendation for a universal child health database to stop children at risk of abuse and neglect from going unnoticed.</p>
<p>“Measuring the poorest families in the country for risk is like erecting a net at the bottom of the cliff and catching the children as they fall down it.</p>
<p>“Rather than stop children becoming vulnerable, this Government has manufactured more at risk children by failing to deal with the root causes of vulnerability – poverty and family stress.</p>
