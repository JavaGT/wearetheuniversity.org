<p>New Research Shows Charter Schools Have Potential</p>
<p>New research produced by Maxim Institute shows that charter schools have potential to increase learning outcomes for some disadvantagedstudents, given certain conditions.</p>
<p>Senior Researcher Steve Thomas carried out a survey of high quality studies on the effects of charter schools on four groups of disadvantaged pupils.</p>
<p>Thomas says there were certain conditions that seemed to increase the likelihood that a charter school would positively affect student learning.</p>
<p>“Having a robust accountability system, and a strong mission statement seemed to make a significant difference to whether or not a charter school helped students learn better.</p>
<p>“New Zealand needs to pay attention to these factors to give Partnership Schools, our version of charter schools, the best possible chance of success.</p>
<p>“In doing so, we may be offering disadvantaged students the best chance of success, too.”</p>
<p>Thomas’ research showed a variety of learning outcomes for disadvantaged students.</p>
<p>Low-income students showed a small to medium improvement compared to their public school peers, however special needs students were generally worse-off at Charter Schools.</p>
