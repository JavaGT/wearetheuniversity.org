<p>Nanaia<br>MAHUTA<br>Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>08 October 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Sick kids can’t learn</strong></p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time for the Government to wake up and admit that growing inequality prevents thousands of kids from getting the most out of their education,&quot; says Labour’s Education Spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
<p>&quot;Many families are struggling to pay rent and power bills and those essential commitments do not leave much money left to buy food.</p>
<p>&quot;For some families, getting into a pre-paid electricity plan like Mercury Energy&#39;s glo-bug pre-pay plan has created further hardship. If a family gets into arrears, when they top-up their account an automatic deduction goes towards arrears rather than addressing immediate electricity needs.</p>
<p>&quot;This often means that disadvantaged children are living in cold damp conditions. They get sick and are unable to go to school and fall even further behind.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government cannot simply sit back and ignore the stark reality that 270,000 children are living in poverty - more must be done.</p>
<p>&quot;Success in education cannot occur in isolation. If children are hungry and sick their chances in life are severely compromised.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s plan to partner with community organisations to provide food in decile 1-3 schools is an important start. Warm, stable affordable housing can also help. Targeted employment initiatives for vulnerable and low income families will go a long way to making a real difference.</p>
<p>&quot;Hekia Parata may be in lock-down mode in her portfolio but she should look above the parapet and convince her cabinet colleagues that they need to take addressing poverty and inequality seriously,” says Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
