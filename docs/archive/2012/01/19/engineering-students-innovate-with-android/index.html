<p><strong>Engineering students innovate with Android</strong></p>
<p>Android phones donated by Google have given engineering students at Victoria University the chance to innovate as well as ensuring graduates are job-ready.</p>
<p>Google gave Victoria’s School of Engineering and Computer Science 50 Android Nexus 1 phones for student research. The deal was struck, says Senior Lecturer Ian Welch, “through a Victoria alumnus who put us in touch with Android developers at the US-based Internet multinational.”</p>
<p>The state-of-the-art phones have 3G data capability, are GPS-enabled, and include inertial sensors to detect movement.</p>
<p>The new devices have been used in second and third year Network Engineering courses taught by Dr Kris Bubendorfer, Andy Linton and Dr Welch.</p>
<p>Dr Welch says the students developed some fantastic applications with the technology.</p>
<p>That included systems for viewing public transport information, locating lost objects and people needing to be rescued, and a fitness monitoring tool.</p>
<p>“Another innovative idea was creating an application that allowed workers to sign in and out so it was quite clear exactly how long they had been there,” says Dr Welch.</p>
<p>The Android phones are ideally suited to co-ordinating a group of people with one student developing a system for tradespeople working in a town or suburb to pick up supplies for each other.</p>
<p>“When they needed something from town, they could post a message on the phone and if there was another tradesperson already at the store they could collect the items for them.”</p>
<p>There were no strings attached to the gift, although Dr Welch says Google is interested in hearing the results of the students’ work.</p>
<p>And there is also interest from businesses in Wellington who are looking for staff to help with mobile applications.</p>
<p>“This is pretty new technology and there is nowhere else in Wellington where you can experiment with it.</p>
<p>“With this type of interaction, our students are developing the technical expertise required by employers and will be able to make a difference from day one in the workforce.”</p>
<p>Dr Bubendorfer says having access to the phones inspired students and staff alike.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see students grasp a concept and then get out there and develop their own novel applications. But it was also rewarding for us. Using the phones was probably the most fun I’ve had in a university course. I left some of those lectures really buzzing.”</p>
<p>Victoria is the only university in New Zealand to offer specialisation in Network Engineering, a programme in which students study the design and implementation of modern forms of communications technology.</p>
<p>The other two digital engineering programmes offered at Victoria are Electronic and Computer Systems Engineering and Software Engineering.</p>
<p>“Students taking these courses come out equipped to tackle engineering problems of the 21st century,” says Dr Welch.</p>
