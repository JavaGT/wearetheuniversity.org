<p><strong>Waikato student’s software picked up by Google and NASA</strong></p>
<p>Software written by a University of Waikato computer science student has found its way to Google and NASA and is being used at the Johnson Space Center.</p>
<p>Computer science doctoral student Paul Hunkin’s software ClusterGL was created for the university’s display wall in 2008 and joins multiple computers together to make one huge display screen.</p>
<p>After catching the eye of Google earlier this year, the program is now is being used around the world.</p>
<p>Hunkin says there are five computers behind the Waikato display wall, with each computer controlling four screens. ClusterGL turns a display wall into one giant screen, by letting a single program on one computer control all monitors.</p>
<p>While the Waikato display wall is relatively small, ClusterGL can scale to let you have a display wall made from a handful to hundreds of monitors.</p>
<p>“I was talking to Google about another project I was working on and happened to mention ClusterGL. They have these curved display walls and thought ‘this will be brilliant for what we want’.”</p>
<p>Google offered Hunkin a Summer of Code internship where they paid him to further develop the software for their own curved display walls.</p>
<p>“ClusterGL was designed to work on a flat wall like the one we have at the university. Google’s involvement was to make ClusterGL better and work on a curved geometry.”</p>
<p>After releasing the software to the public, NASA saw the program and are now using it in the Johnson Space Center.</p>

<p>“NASA saw one of Google’s curved display walls and bought one of them. I was pretty surprised to hear they were using it considering it started out as something that I put together one a rainy Sunday afternoon,” says Hunkin.</p>
<p>Bid Bot, another program created by Hunkin which drew global media attention last year, works by scouring TradeMe every evening looking to bid on and buy newly-listed items for $1. After scouring TradeMe, Bid Bot would pick the rarest item and after a successful auction, tweet what it had bought.</p>
