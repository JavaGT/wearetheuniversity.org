<p>It’s not too late to enrol at UC - special info session this Thursday</p>
<p>Campus tours and course advice will be available for anyone still thinking about enrolling at UC in 2012, at a special information session this Thursday (2 February).</p>
<p>Staff from all colleges will be on hand to offer practical advice on enrolment processes, courses and timetables at the “UCan Still Enrol” event, which will run between 3pm and 7pm in the Central Lecture Theatre block.</p>
<p>“This is an opportunity to join the more than 14,000 students who have already applied to enrol at UC to study this year,” said University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor, Dr Rod Carr. “Tertiary studies are a great way for people to upskill and increase their employment options in 2012. Employers may also be interested in coming to event and learning more about tertiary studies as a professional development option for their employees.</p>
<p>“Visitors to campus can also see the new social spaces that are being developed on campus for 2012 including phase 2 of the Undercroft project in the James Hight building.”</p>
<p>Free parking will be available on campus. Visitors are asked to drive onto the campus from Clyde Rd onto Arts Rd and to follow the signs from there to the event.</p>
