<p><strong>UC prepares for new academic year</strong></p>
<p>The University of Canterbury is preparing to welcome students from around the world for the start of the 2012 academic year on 20 February.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says nearly 14,000 students have applied to enrol to study at UC, nearly 2000 more students than at the same time last year.</p>
<p>“More than 3000 domestic students and 1200 international students have applied to enrol for the first time at UC, showing their confidence in the quality and availability of a world-class learning environment at UC.</p>
<p>“While applications from international students are about 90 per cent of the same time last year and first year domestic students are 95 per cent of the same time last year, total applications to enrol are 15 per cent up on the same time last year.</p>
<p>“While not all those who apply to enrol will ultimately be offered a place and accept that offer, it is a sign of confidence in the University and Christchurch that not only are we open for business but the messages of resilience, quality and opportunity have been heard by thousands of students,” says Dr Carr.</p>
<p>“More than 1100 first year domestic undergraduate students will benefit from the admission scholarships which offer up to $3000 for academic achievement in NCEA or the equivalent.</p>
<p>“The University is continuing to accept late applications to enrol and is suggesting 2012 may be a good year for students who discontinued studies to re-engage; for employers to pay tuition for employees to study part-time as part of recruitment, retention and staff development initiatives; for those waiting for rebuild opportunities to come their way to upskill; and for those with family moving to the city for new work and opportunities to take advantage of affordable, accessible world-class higher education.”</p>

<p>Dr Carr says it is inspiring to note that Christchurch is re-emerging as one of New Zealand&#39;s &quot;most exciting cities&quot;, according to travel guide Lonely Planet. &quot;There&#39;s still plenty to do, and you&#39;ll be supporting the new businesses inspiring Christchurch&#39;s renaissance,” said Lonely Planet author Brett Atkinson.</p>
<p>Following aftershocks in late December all UC facilities have been fully assessed by structural engineers and all facilities required for 2012 will be ready in time. More than 10,000sqm of student support, teaching, tutorial and library space has been remediated and access restrictions lifted for the first semester of 2012.</p>
<p>Phase two of the Undercroft – the new student social space under the James Hight Library – will be completed before the start of the academic year with additional cafes, food and beverage outlets opening their doors during term one. The UCSA Events Centre remains on track for opening after Easter.</p>
