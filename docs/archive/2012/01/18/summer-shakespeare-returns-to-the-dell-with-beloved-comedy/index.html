<p>Recently it was announced that favourite summer event, the Gardens Magic concerts have been shifted to March-April 2012, but Wellingtonians will not have to wait until autumn for lively entertainment to accompany their summer picnics. Summer Shakespeare’s Victoria University season of <em>Twelfth Night</em> will play in the Dell from 17 February. BYO picnics highly recommended!</p>
<p><em>Twelfth Night</em>, directed by Melanie Camp, will be an occasion of frivolity, food and wine. From raucous comedy to swooning romance, Camp’s production, set by the seaside in the 1920s, swings through the many moods of love and life with wit, laughter and live music.</p>
<p>Camp says, “the 1920s setting is crazy, colourful and raucous; and has a great sense of contrast between dark and light: that tinge of sadness that is necessary to fully appreciate happiness. I think New Zealand audiences today understand this feeling after all we’ve been through recently. People want to enjoy themselves because they understand how precious these happy days are.”</p>
<p><em>Twelfth Night</em> features a vibrant cast of talented actors including graduates and students of the Victoria University Theatre Programme and Toi Whakaari New Zealand Drama School. As well as a selection of New Zealand’s next generation of top actors, this well-rounded cast includes more experienced performers: Todd Dixon, Ross Young and Kirsty Hamilton.</p>
<p><em>Twelfth Night</em> promises to be a sassy, mischievous affair with colourful costumes and lively music: “so much of today’s fashion is scruffy and eclectic, but why don’t we create something really pretty and sexy? Sharp suits and glamorous dresses that will bring out the best in young actors. They can look good and misbehave at the same time – it’s the perfect combination.”</p>
<p>The community will welcome this February event in the Dell, and can look forward to the chance to make the most of the long summer evenings.</p>
