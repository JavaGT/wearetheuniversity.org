<p>The Italian Job</p>
<p>University of Waikato composers David Griffiths and Michael Williams will represent Oceania at the international Volcanic Lakes Festival in Italy this February, the only performers from the South Pacific.</p>
<p>“It’s a real honour and privilege to be asked to write something for this wonderful festival,” said Williams. “David and I are the sole representatives from this side of the world with composers from America, the UK, Korea and Egypt also attending.”</p>
<p>Just north of Rome, the festival takes place over three weekends at five volcanic lakes. Each of the lakes has a legend attached to it and composers were assigned lakes and legends as the basis of their compositions.</p>
<p>Williams was given Lake Bolsena and the legend of Queen Amalasunta.</p>
<p>Griffiths was asked to compose and direct a hymn to a text, Trace, by Maria Lanciotti that will be presented at each of the concerts.</p>
<p>Griffiths, who is one of New Zealand’s leading baritones, will also give a recital in Rome singing works by Bellini, Mozart, Schubert, Brahms and Rossini.</p>
<p>“It is such a wonderful opportunity to represent New Zealand in the birth-place of so much European culture,” said Griffiths.</p>
<p>Williams will also use the opportunity re-visit Montecassino, the location of his recently finished opera The Juniper Passion with a view to garner interest for an Italian performance.<br>ends</p>
