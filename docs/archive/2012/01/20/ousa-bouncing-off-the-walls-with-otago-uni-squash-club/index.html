<p>OUSA bouncing off the walls with Otago Uni Squash Club</p>
<p>Improvements to the walls of the Otago University Squash Club by the Otago University Students&#39; Association will mean a longer life and better play for the champion club.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ve started a refurbishment process resurfacing the court walls which will mean squash players from around Otago will benefit from a better quality playing surface,&quot; says Logan Edgar, OUSA President, &quot;It&#39;s an OUSA club that has a strong membership base that performs well at many skill levels.&quot;</p>
<p>Court 2 will be served up a shot of freshness with the front wall being stripped back to the bricks (see attached image) and resurfaced, a process which is likely to take around one month and will be finished in time for the first stroke in Orientation Week&#39;s social games.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s about maintaining a good facility for the long term, that will help keep both social and competitive members coming back to our courts,&quot; says Mr. Edgar, &quot;Over the years the Otago University Squash Club has won numerous awards including; Best Club on Campus, and New Zealand Squash Club of the year, and we want to make sure we&#39;ve got a facility they can continue to boast about.&quot;</p>
<p>With two of the three courts still open for business the OUSC will continue to operate as per usual. It has already begun to take on new members for it&#39;s wide range of skill level teams or for the social player, with casual play rates being available from the OUSA Clubs and Societies building on Albany Street for casual drop ins.<br>ends</p>
