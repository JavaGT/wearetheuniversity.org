<p>The University of the South Pacific hosted a farewell lunch for the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Resident Representative to Fiji, Mr Juichiro Sasaki on 23 January, 2012.</p>
<p>The Vice-Chancellor and President of USP, Professor Rajesh Chandra together with members of the University’s Senior Management Team and other senior staff were present at the Japan- Pacific ICT Centre in Suva, to bid farewell to Mr Sasaki and to thank him for his contribution towards the University.</p>
<p>Mr Sasaki took up his role with JICA in 2008 and played a significant role in facilitating the construction of the Japan-Pacific ICT Centre at USP. The state-of-the-art landmark facility for the region comprises two buildings with fully-equipped computer laboratories, conference rooms, and a multi-purpose lecture theatre.</p>
<p>In thanking Mr Sasaki, Professor Chandra expressed his sincere gratitude to the outgoing JICA Resident Representative for his commitment and support during his time in Fiji. Professor Chandra said he was extremely pleased to have both Mr Sasaki and his successor, the new JICA Resident Representative, Mr Shumon Yoshiara present at the farewell. “Through Mr Sasaki’s leadership at JICA, USP has gained a lot of support and we look forward to working very closely with the incoming representative, to further this collaboration with JICA in the near future,” he added.</p>
<p>It was during Mr Sasaki’s tenure that the JICA President, Madam Sadako Ogata visited USP. Professor Chandra described this as a “momentous and meaningful occasion for the University” and thanked Mr Sasaki for making the visit possible. Highlighting the strong relationship that USP shares with JICA and the Government of Japan, the Vice-Chancellor said that Mr Yoshiara will be able to see how such assistance has benefited USP and its member countries.</p>
