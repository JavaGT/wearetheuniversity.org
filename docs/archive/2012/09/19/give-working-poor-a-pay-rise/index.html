<p>David Clark<br>MP for Dunedin North</p>
<p>19 September 2012</p>
<p><strong>Give working poor a pay rise</strong></p>
<p>John Key should take time out today from desperately concentrating on not reading the police report into John Banks’ mayoral campaign donations to do something for the working poor, says David Clark.</p>
<p>Dr Clark’s bill to raise the minimum wage by $1.50 to $15 an hour will be voted on by MPs this evening.</p>
<p>“John Key promised much to New Zealanders when he became Prime Minister. He promised to raise ethical standards in Government, and to close the wage gap with Australia.</p>
<p>“He may have abandoned the ethical standards goal with his blind support of John Banks, but he should not give up on the working poor.</p>
<p>“Two out of five of the 270,000 children living in poverty in New Zealand come from working families. That is something that our Parliament should be ashamed off. Boosting the minimum wage would make a real difference to the lives of thousands of struggling Kiwi families.</p>
<p>“John Key, John Banks and Peter Dunne should support my Bill at its first reading so that the public can have their say on the minimum wage. Kiwis deserve a fair days pay for an honest day’s work, and they also deserve the chance to have a fair say.</p>
<p>“We should not be happy to settle for New Zealand remaining a low-wage economy where the best opportunities involve a flight across the Tasman,” says David Clark.</p>
