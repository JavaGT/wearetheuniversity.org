<p>Jacinda<br>Ardern<br>Social Development Spokesperson<br>Spokesperson for Children<br>19 September 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT  </p>
<p><strong>Bill Takes Bold Steps To Tackle Child Poverty</strong></p>
<p>A bill to tackle the causes of New Zealand’s child poverty shame will deliver genuine change for our most vulnerable kids, its sponsor Labour MP Jacinda Ardern says.</p>
<p>“Around 270,000 Kiwi children are now living in poverty. That means they are missing out on things most of us take for granted – basic health care, good nutrition, educational opportunities.</p>
<p>“My Bill is about giving those kids a chance in life and not simply treating the short-term symptoms.</p>
<p>“It sets goals to achieve a sustainable reduction in the numbers of children living in poverty and alleviate the socio-economic disadvantage those children experience.</p>
<p>“It sets a definition of poverty, establishes methods to measure it and ensures that government becomes a champion on behalf of our kids and puts their needs at the heart of future decision-making.</p>
<p>Put simply, the Bill will require the government to identify, act, and report. It is about delivering change, and being accountable if improvements aren&#39;t delivered for kids.<br>The United Kingdom is one of the few countries in the world that has similar legislation to what I am proposing.</p>
<p>“Similar framework has also been recommended by the Children&#39;s Commissioner Expert Advisory Group on Solutions to Child Poverty in its recently released working papers.</p>

<p>“To borrow a quote from leading academic Dame Anne Salmond, ‘an ageing society that doesn&#39;t care for its young has a death wish.’</p>
<p>“Those are wise words and ones we can’t afford to ignore any longer.</p>
<p>“My Bill gives New Zealand a chance to, if not lead, then definitely punch above its weight on this really important social issue.</p>
<p>“It sets these children on a pathway to a far better future,” Jacinda Ardern says.</p>
