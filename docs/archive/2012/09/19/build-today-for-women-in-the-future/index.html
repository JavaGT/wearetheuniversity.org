<p>Annette<br>KING<br>Spokesperson for Housing</p>
<p>19 September 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Build today for women in the future</strong></p>
<p>Suffrage Day offers a perfect opportunity for the Government to consider the long-term consequences of the growing number of homeless New Zealand women, Labour’s Housing spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“It is time this Government heeded the warning signs. We know there’s already a shortage of affordable houses and we know there is not enough being built.</p>
<p>“Social agencies are now reporting single women - of any age - are sleeping in cars, couch surfing and in short term boarding houses. They are desperate for housing.</p>
<p>“We should be winding the tape forward right now to plan for affordable housing across the county for the many, many women who are going to need it in the future.</p>
<p>“Today’s 15 year old will be looking down the barrel of poverty when she retires in 50 years’ time if we don’t.</p>
<p>“That same 15 year old will probably live longer, still be paying off her student loan, and be retiring with less than her male counterpart.</p>
<p>“Without change, and without a real housing plan, you have a recipe for poverty for many older women.</p>
<p>“Continuing to look at major issues such as housing in three-year political cycles is short-sighted.</p>
<p>“We need to be looking at the life our teenage girls will live as retirees in 50 years’ time and we need to start building for that now,” said Annette King.</p>
