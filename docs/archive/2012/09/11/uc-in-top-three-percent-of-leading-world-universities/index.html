<p>UC in top three percent of leading world universities</p>
<p>September 11, 2012</p>
<p>Despite two natural disasters in the past two years in Christchurch, the University of Canterbury has maintained its ranking among the top three percent of the world’s universities.</p>
<p>UC is ranked at 221st in the world. UC’s College of Engineering is ranked 134th in the world while UC’s College of Science is among the top 200 in the world. As an employer, UC was ranked 151 in the world.</p>
<p>UC Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr said to retain its position in the top three percent was remarkable considering the unprecedented complications caused by the February 2011 earthquake.</p>
<p>``We have responded rapidly post-earthquakes with so much activity progressing and developing on campus. Today we have 13,000 students, 1900 staff and 600 courses for this semester and applications to our halls of residence for 2013 are clearly up on the last two years.</p>
<p>``We have built 15,000 square metres of student learning and faculty space in Kirkwood and Dovedale Villages and we are remediating other buildings as we go while the Undercroft has become the new central hub for students to gather,’’ Dr Carr said.</p>
<p>UC is leading post-earthquake research with 170 projects looking into a wide range of subjects.</p>
