<p><strong>Tuesday, 11 September 2012, 9:33 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/AUT_University">AUT University</a></strong></p>
<p>Monday, 10 September 2012 – EMBARGOED until 6.31am, Tuesday 11 September 2012.</p>
<p><strong>AUT University receives international recognition</strong></p>
<p>The latest set of world rankings has placed AUT University in the top 500 for the first time. As New Zealand’s newest university it is a significant achievement to already be receiving international acknowledgment. AUT is also New Zealand’s fastest growing university providing almost all the degree growth in New Zealand for the past 10 years.</p>
<p>“It is an accomplishment for AUT and New Zealand universities in general to obtain international rankings. New Zealand universities only receive a small proportion of the funding our international counterparts have access to and this recognition is confirmation the consistent approach to university quality in New Zealand is working,” says Derek McCormack, AUT’s Vice Chancellor.</p>
<p>“In the Committee on University Academic Programmes (CUAP), we have an excellent national system of quality assurance for New Zealand universities. Students who study in New Zealand can be confident that the education standards are consistently excellent and the qualifications are comparable to other universities internationally,” says Derek McCormack.</p>
<p>The QS World University Rankings® have been in existence since 2004 and the QS Intelligence Unit was formed in 2008 to meet the increasing public interest for comparative data on universities and organisations, and the growing demand for institutions to develop deeper insight into their competitive environment.</p>

<p>There are currently over 10,000 universities in the world of which the QS system considers 2000 and ranks the top 500. For all of New Zealand’s comprehensive universities to now be in the top 500 (5% of universities world-wide) is a singular achievement.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
<p>AUT, the University for the changing world, is New Zealand’s fastest growing university. AUT is an outwards-facing, diverse and relevant institution, engaged with the current and future issues of industry, business and the community, as well as the wider issues that confront our economy and society.
