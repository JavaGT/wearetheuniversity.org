<p><strong>Mirroring society? Health Sciences students’ backgrounds examined</strong></p>
<p>University of Otago research is raising questions about the extent to which health sciences students reflect a cross-section of society, but also shows progress is being made in broadening the student intake in terms of their social background.</p>
<p>The study, published in the latest issue of the <em>New Zealand Medical Journal</em>, suggests that efforts to encourage a wider ethnic and socio-economic mix of students to qualify for entry into health professional courses are making a difference, but there is still some way to go.</p>
<p>The research into the students’ sociodemographic characteristics was led by Otago’s Health Sciences Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor Peter Crampton.</p>
<p>Health Sciences students at the University of Otago compete for entry into eight professional programmes such as medicine, dentistry or physiotherapy after their first year of study.</p>
<p>The anonymous data from University records shows that Māori, Pacific and students from poorer socio-economic areas in 2010 are under-represented in all health sciences professional programmes.</p>
<p>For example, 51% of students in health sciences at the University of Otago are from schools which have a decile rating of 8 or above, and 3.5% attended secondary schools with a rating of decile 3 or below.</p>
<p>However, the programme with by far the highest proportion of Māori students is now medicine, with an all-time high of 16% of second-year medical students in 2012 being Māori, reflecting broader New Zealand demographics. This has been assisted by the priority entry programme, so long as Māori students meet minimum admissions criteria.</p>

<p>Over all eight programmes, the study found that health sciences students from the European/Other category made up 65% of domestic students (60% total NZ population 18-24 year olds), Asian 34% (14% 18-24 year olds), Māori 6.3% (17%), and Pacific 2.3% (9%) (noting that students could list more than one ethnicity).</p>
<p>“It’s clear that at the University of Otago, as in other international universities, health science faculties struggle to achieve a balance of students that reflects the ethnic and socio-economic realities they will serve as health professionals,” says Professor Crampton.</p>
<p>“However a wide range of selection and student support policies continue to counter these historical and social forces affecting student intake.”</p>
<p>He says continuing effort is required to work with other key stakeholders in the education system to better prepare school leavers for the demands of health sciences programmes.</p>
<p>“The University of Otago has strong policies aimed at modifying these imbalances within programmes, the health sector and society as a whole. These are targeted at attracting students from a wide range of backgrounds and helping those with specific learning needs.”</p>
<p>Professor Crampton points to the open entry to the first year of Health Sciences at Otago, which allows students to compete for places in professional programmes from second year onwards.</p>
<p>The study also details a range of additional support programmes to help students succeed. These include a bridging programme for Māori and Pacific students; outreach science courses such as ‘Science Wananga’ aimed at encouraging secondary students to continue with science; and the Advanced School Sciences Academy to motivate students from rural areas and low decile schools.</p>
<p>Professor Crampton says more recently, under government policy to encourage people to work in these areas, special consideration has been given to students from rural areas or those with a commitment to a career in mental health. Further diversity is encouraged by the fact that over 20% of those offered a place in health science programmes have already completed a degree.</p>
<p>For those students who have entered a health sciences programme there is now a variety of support and leadership roles aimed at assisting students in attaining their career goals and completing their degrees.</p>
