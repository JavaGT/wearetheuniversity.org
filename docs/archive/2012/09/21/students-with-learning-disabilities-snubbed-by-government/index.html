<p><strong>Students with Learning Disabilities Snubbed By the Government</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is calling on the Government to urgently amend the criteria so that all students with reading and writing disabilities are able to access extra assistance to sit NCEA exams.</p>
<p>The call comes after it was revealed today that students with “invisible disabilities” such as dyslexia, ADHD and autism are being denied exam assistance by NZQA.</p>
<p>Disabilities spokesperson Barbara Stewart says the Government must ensure children whose parents have spent up to $1500 to prove their child needs help to sit exams actually receives that help.</p>
<p>“The need to widen the criteria to capture all students requiring help is urgent as NCEA exams are being held in just two months.</p>
<p>“This is not a time for the Government to be dilly-dallying about or making lame excuses.”</p>
<p>Mrs Stewart says failure to help students who have been assessed as struggling to read or write because of a disability will have a negative impact on their future lives.</p>
<p>“Many already have to work harder to keep up with their classmates. Now they are being left behind in their exams unnecessarily.</p>
<p>“If the government doesn’t act fast, these students’ chances of enjoying academic success will be severely restricted.”</p>
