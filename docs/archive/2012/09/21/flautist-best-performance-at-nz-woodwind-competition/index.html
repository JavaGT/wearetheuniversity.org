<p><strong>Flautist Best Performance At New Zealand Woodwind Competition</strong></p>
<p>Waikato University music student Lauren Grout has taken first place at the New Zealand Woodwind Competition, held at Westlake Girls High School on the 15 and 16 September.</p>
<p>Lauren entered in the tertiary section, where she performed a 25 minute programme and an unaccompanied piece in the final where the judges ultimately chose her as the winner over 15 other competitors in her category.</p>
<p>Lauren, a 3rd year music student who has been playing the flute for 10 years, says she was quite anxious before performing as she changed her programme a couple of days before the competition after checking the rules again carefully.</p>
<p>“I felt my initial performance wasn’t as good as I would have like, but I thought I played very well during the final round.”</p>
<p>The talented musician also claimed Best Performance of a New Zealand Work on the night with her Concerto for flute composed by Anthony Ritchie.</p>
<p>Her prizes included $2,000 for first place in the tertiary section and $100 voucher and a free 12 month library membership for Best Performance of a New Zealand Work.</p>
<p>Lauren plans to use the prize money towards her future career. “I’m hoping to use the prize money to help fund a trip overseas to audition at schools in Europe.”</p>
<p>Waikato University clarinettist Nathaniel Smorti also competed, giving a highly commendable performance and making it to the final round.</p>
<p>The music programme will be celebrating their 25 year anniversary this October and there will be a concert on the 13 and 14 October to mark the occasion.</p>
