<p><strong>Lincoln University hosts new Austrian Ambassador</strong></p>
<p>Lincoln University welcomed the new Austrian Ambassador for New Zealand – Dr Helmut Boeck – on to campus to meet students and staff involved with the University’s international sustainability degree programme.</p>
<p>The Ambassador was accompanied by the Honorary Consul (South Island) for Austria, David Halstead, who has been instrumental in assisting New Zealand students travelling to Austria as part of the University’s jointly awarded degree with the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU) in Vienna.</p>
<p>Under the Master of Natural Resources Management and Ecological Engineering (MNaRMEE) programme students who enrol at Lincoln University spend one semester (approximately six months) in Austria, and three semesters at Lincoln University. Students who enrol in BOKU – such as those who met the Ambassador – spend one semester in New Zealand and three in Austria.</p>
<p>Dr Boeck was made aware of the programme on his recent appointment to the Ambassadorial role in New Zealand. He shared with the students and staff at Lincoln University his thoughts on the unique relationship between BOKU and Lincoln University saying how important it was “as the subjects being taught and studied at (these Universities) are global ones.” He went on to say that he is “delighted to see such collaborations and to meet the students and staff who are involved.”</p>
<p>The jointly awarded Master’s degree prepares students seeking an international career in the areas of sustainable management of natural resources, environmental management, ecological engineering or business for sustainability – where an international focus will be an advantage. The specialist nature of the programme is now attracting international students from elsewhere in the world to Lincoln University where they can study in two ‘foreign’ countries as part of their degree. In 2013 there are students from seven different countries coming to Lincoln University from BOKU and this year there are four students from Lincoln currently in Vienna – three from New Zealand and one from Nepal.</p>
<p>Students who enrol through Lincoln University currently have their flights to Vienna paid for by BOKU to help ease the financial pressures of taking the international degree.</p>
