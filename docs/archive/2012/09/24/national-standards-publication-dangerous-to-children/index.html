<p><strong>National Standards publication dangerous to children’s learning</strong></p>
<p>Children from poorer backgrounds will be the biggest losers following the publication of “ropey” National Standards data.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa National President Ian Leckie says the data is dangerous because it is misleading and does not provide any useful information to parents, teachers or schools.</p>
<p>“We already know which children are struggling, we know why they’re struggling and we know what to do about it,” he says.</p>
<p>“We know that smaller classes, more individualised learning, reading recovery programmes, and increased resources for special needs students all make a huge difference to outcomes.”</p>
<p>“We also know that academic under-achievement is exacerbated by poverty and New Zealand has one of the fastest growing inequality gaps in the OECD. The Government cannot ignore the fact that poverty and inequality are the biggest drivers of student under-achievement.&quot;</p>
<p>“In so many schools teachers and parents have done a wonderful job of lifting the achievement of struggling students but the biggest roadblock has always been a lack of resources.”</p>
<p>“So let’s start hearing what the Government proposes to do to lift the achievement of so-called failing students.</p>
<p>“Clearly it’s time the Government takes a close look at its policies around child poverty as well as addressing the resourcing issues within schools.”  </p>
