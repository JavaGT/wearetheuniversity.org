<p><strong>Performance Pay - next step in attack on quality public education</strong></p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa says the Education Minister Hekia Parata needs to come clean over the Government’s real agenda for education.</p>
<p>“It is most disturbing that two days after the publication of inaccurate and ‘ropey’ National Standards, the Minister is now saying that National Standards could be used as a tool in assessing the performance of teachers,” says NZEI National Secretary, Paul Goulter.</p>
<p>“This is yet another indication of the Government’s real education agenda – one that runs completely counter to international best practice.”</p>
<p>“For instance, a recent OECD report on performance pay for teachers found that there is no relationship between student achievement and the use of performance-based pay schemes.</p>
<p>“It is very clear that the development of narrow and misleading National Standards and league tables is setting the stage for a system of performance pay for teachers.”</p>
<p>“Clearly this is part of a full frontal attack on our curriculum, our quality public education system and our teachers.”</p>
<p>“The Government needs to address issues such as child poverty and our widening inequality gap instead of conveniently blaming teachers for student under-achievement.”</p>
<p>“Instead of setting up students and schools for failure, the Government needs to ensure that every child goes to a good school and gets a good education.”</p>
