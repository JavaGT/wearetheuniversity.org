<p>12 September 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>Undisclosed ACC sum sunk into prison privatisation gamble</p>
<p>ACC’s involvement as one of the five members of the consortium that has won the contract to build a private prison in Wiri is completely inappropriate, Labour’s Justice spokesperson Charles Chauvel says.</p>
<p>“ACC was created to ensure that New Zealanders could access affordable rehabilitation services. To see it investing in a private prison project which is opposed by most New Zealanders is, quite simply, bizarre.</p>
<p>“It also raises questions around the safety of the investment. Serco is already operating Mt Eden Prison on a contract basis. It is repeatedly failing to meet its performance targets.</p>
<p>“There is no reason to think that the Wiri operation will be any more successful, given the sausage factory imperatives of the private prison business model.</p>
<p>“National has consistently refused to make the terms of the Wiri prison contract public, despite taxpayer money being involved. It is reputed to be of a 25 to 30 year duration, and to be worth some $1 billion.</p>
<p>“Judith Collins, asked in the House today whether she or her predecessor, Nick Smith, had been consulted about the decision by ACC to invest in building and operating a private prison, and whether she had concerns about the investment, admitted Dr Smith had been briefed about the investment.</p>
<p>“It is a shame that he did not invite ACC to reflect on whether it was an appropriate destination for investment of the Corporation’s funds.</p>
<p>“It is even more of a shame that Judith Collins has failed to send a similar signal since she became the Minister,” Charles Chauvel said</p>
