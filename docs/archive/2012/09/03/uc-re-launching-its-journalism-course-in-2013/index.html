<p><strong>UC re-launching its journalism course in 2013</strong></p>
<p><strong>September 3, 2012</strong></p>
<p>Canterbury University is re-launching its journalism course, which was not offered in 2012 in the wake of the Canterbury earthquakes.</p>
<p>The course, which began in the 1920s, has trained some of the country’s foremost journalists.</p>
<p>UC has appointed Tara Ross, a former journalist for The Press and the Sunday Star-Times, as the senior lecturer in journalism. Ross is a Qantas Award-winning reporter with a reputation for insight and depth of analysis in her reporting.</p>
<p>Acting head of social and political sciences Dr Donald Matheson said Ross impressed the university with her vision for journalism education in a rapidly changing media environment.</p>
<p>``The key skills of the journalist, such as asking questions, getting the facts right and quality writing, are as important as ever,” he said.</p>
<p>``But Tara Ross will be preparing journalists to work across media and in new ways.</p>
<p>``They may be live blogging one day, talking with their audience on social media the next and working with a non-profit organisation the day after that. In addition, Ross brings the analytical skills to carry on the course’s tradition of turning out reflective journalists.’’</p>
<p>Ross said the biggest challenge for journalism currently was re-engaging with its community.</p>
<p>``That’s not about letting go of professional practices but about learning how to speak with communities to be more relevant to them,” she said today.<br>Ross has won numerous awards and scholarships for her academic work and is herself a graduate of the Canterbury journalism programme. She won the Bain Prize as the top journalism student of her year.<br>The university put the course on hold in 2012 due to uncertainties over enrolments and an unsuccessful search for a lecturer. Dr Matheson said the course’s restarting was a sign of the university rebuilding its strengths post-quake. Enrolments for 2013 close on November 15.</p>
