<p>Partnership Schools/Kura Hourua – known internationally as charter schools – are one of the Government’s initiatives aimed at addressing student underachievement. As a relatively late adopter of the concept, New Zealand has the advantage of being able to learn from the successes and failures of models in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Join us for a discussion on what KIPP, a US network of 125 high-performing charter schools, has been able to deliver in terms of educational achievement and new ways for parents and communities to be involved in their children’s education.</p>
<p>KIPP serves nearly 40,000 students across 20 US states. More than 85% of students are from low-income families, 95% are Afro-American or Latino/Hispanic, 14% are English language learners, and 9% receive special education services. Over 90% of KIPP middle school students go on to graduate from high school, and over 85% of KIPP alumni go on to university/tertiary education.</p>
<p>Dr Feinberg co-founded KIPP, is currently Executive Vice-Chair of KIPP Houston, and serves on the board of KIPP Foundation. He has won numerous awards for educational excellence and public service/social entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Dr Feinberg’s visit to New Zealand is being made possible by the Aotearoa Foundation.  </p>
