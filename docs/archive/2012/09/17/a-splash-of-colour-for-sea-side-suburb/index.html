<p><strong>A splash of colour for sea-side suburb</strong></p>
<p>Just as they did with the Victoria Green site on the corner of Victoria and Salisbury Streets and the Piko site on Barbadoes Street, students at Lincoln University’s School of Landscape Architecture are up to their beautifying ways once again.</p>
<p>This time they’ve turned their attention to the site of the old Joyland Cinema in New Brighton which was badly damaged in the February quake. In collaboration with the Greening the Rubble Trust, the goal is to transform the area into a mini-park.</p>
<p>The design itself is the work of second year Bachelor of Landscape Architecture students, and the colourful project will include mounds of wildflowers, wigwams for climbing plants, and serve as an enjoyable route from the New Brighton Mall to the carpark beyond.</p>
<p>“As well as being a funky reference to earthquakes and recovery activity through winding paths and fields of spades, the goal is create a kind of labyrinth reflecting the confusing journey we have made, but also providing an opportunity for reflection,” according to Neil Challenger, Senior Lecturer in Landscape Architecture at Lincoln University.</p>
<p>“We intend to build something that will contribute to New Brighton. It’s a suburb that has been badly affected by the earthquakes and this small landscape will be a fun, uplifting and enjoyable addition to the community,” says Mr Challenger. “The project matters because landscape matters. This small project is designed to help New Brighton on its journey to recovery and beyond.”</p>

<p>Volunteers from the community are needed to help with the build itself, which will take place over 27, 28 and 29 September. Those willing to lend a hand for part or all of the project build can register on the Student Volunteer Army’s ‘The Concert’ website at <a href="http://www.theconcert.co.nz">www.theconcert.co.nz</a> with the project posted as ‘Lincoln SOLA Greening Brighton’.</p>
<p>Those volunteering will be rewarded for their efforts with tickets to the concert itself on Saturday 3 November; an R15 event which will include such acts as Hollie Smith, Goodshirt, Dane Rumble and Avalanche City.</p>
