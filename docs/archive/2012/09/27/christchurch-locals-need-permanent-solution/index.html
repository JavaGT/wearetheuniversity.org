<p>Annette<br>King<br>Housing Spokesperson</p>
<p>27 September 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Christchurch locals need permanent solution</strong></p>
<p>News that the Government has sped up the development of temporary accommodation for workers helping with Christchurch’s rebuild will go down like a bucket of sick with homeless locals still waiting to hear of their fate, Labour’s Housing spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“Gerry Brownlee pointed out that changes to the city plan, announced yesterday, will provide certainty for councils, developers, and communities regarding possible locations for temporary workers’ accommodation.</p>
<p>“That&#39;s all well and good, but what about certainty for local people desperate to know where they can build? Where is the certainty for them? Where do they fit on the priority list?</p>
<p>“Not only that, there’s now some 450 council units throughout Christchurch that have been deemed too dangerous to be tenanted. Restoring some of that social housing should also be fast-tracked.</p>
<p>“Mr Brownlee says he is tired of moaners and whingers. The people he tars with that brush have every right to be upset.</p>
<p>“It&#39;s time he put up his hand and took responsibility for leaving thousands of Canterbury people frustrated and dissatisfied through lack of certainty about their future.</p>
<p>“Get your act together Gerry. If you can help get housing for some temporary workers, then you should also be putting some energy into helping locals with housing,” Annette King said.</p>
