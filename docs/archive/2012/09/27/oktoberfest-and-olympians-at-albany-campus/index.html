<p><strong>Oktoberfest and Olympians at Albany campus</strong></p>
<p>Massey University’s Albany campus kicks off October with a week of on and off-campus events designed to inspire, challenge and enlighten.</p>
<p>On Tuesday October 2, Valerie Adams is the guest of honour at the Massey University Blues Awards, a night of sporting celebration being held at North Harbour Stadium’s ASB room. The Blues Awards are presented to students in recognition of their outstanding achievements in both sport and academic studies. Previous recipients include Hamish Bond, Juliette Haigh, Simon Child and Lisa Carrington.</p>
<p>A number of Massey Olympians will also be attending the dinner, and tickets are available to purchase online at: <a href="http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/student-life/sport/blues-awards/purchase-tickets.cfm">http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/student-life/sport/blues-awards/purchase-tickets.cfm</a></p>
<p>A photographic exhibition from Germany’s Goethe-Institut will be installed at Student Central on October 1 and will remain on campus until October 9. This travelling exhibition, called <em>The Power of Language</em>, contains 56 photographs, which are the best of over 4,000 photographs submitted for a competition on the power of language. The focus of the exhibition is primarily on the role languages play in a globalised world, and the exhibition will return to Germany after its Massey installation.</p>
<p>The exhibition forms part of the Oktoberfest celebrations on campus, which include the screening of a subtitled German documentary on music, a scavenger quiz and a demonstration of German dances, as well as German-themed games and food.</p>

<p>New Zealand’s first deaf Member of Parliament, Mojo Mathers, will be speaking at a public lecture on Wednesday October 3. Her lecture is titled <em>Hearing Impaired New Zealanders – what does the future hold?</em></p>
<p>Ms Mathers was born profoundly deaf and grew up lip reading and communicating orally before starting to use sign language in the late 2000s. Her election to Parliament in November 2011 heralded the first maiden speech to be delivered in sign language, and subsequently required extensive negotiation over the delivery of note-taking services to assist her in participating fully in the cut and thrust of parliamentary life.</p>
<p>Ms Mathers will briefly touch upon her journey into politics, including some of the challenges faced as a deaf candidate and as New Zealand’s first deaf Member of Parliament. She will then focus on her vision for the future assistance of the hearing impaired and deaf communities in New Zealand, in order to ensure their active participation in civil society. She will also outline what she sees as priorities for action.</p>
<p>This lecture will be supported by sign language interpreters, and is free to the public. The lecture starts at 6pm at the Sir Neil Waters Lecture Theatre, at Massey University on the Albany Expressway, SH 17, and is expected to be finished by 7.30pm.</p>
<p>Tea and coffee will be available before the lecture, so please RSVP by contacting Massey University email: <a href="mailto:Public-Lectures@massey.ac.nz">Public-Lectures@massey.ac.nz</a>.</p>
