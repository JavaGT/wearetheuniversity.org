<p><strong>Time for Hayes to front up</strong></p>
<p><strong>Press Release: Wairarapa Labour Party</strong></p>
<p><em>2 September 2012</em></p>
<p>It is time for Wairarapa MP John Hayes to front up over his claims that he has canvassed “several thousand” Wairarapa residents over same-sex marriage and that the Marriage Equality Bill will lead to polygamy and legalised incest, Wairarapa Labour Chairman, Kieran McAnulty, says.</p>
<p>Since claiming a strong mandate from &#39;people in the streets and in the bars from Waipawa to Martinborough&#39;, John Hayes has come under pressure from his electorate to reveal precisely how he managed to canvass them without holding public meetings and clinics or conducting a survey.</p>
<p>“I am organising a public meeting in Masterton and have confirmed speakers whom are both for and against Marriage Equality. We intend to provide a public forum where residents can discuss the Bill and hear the perspectives of sponsor Labour MP Louisa Wall, Green MP Kevin Hague and Conservative Party leader Colin Craig.</p>
<p>“The meeting would also provide John Hayes with an opportunity to reveal details of his canvassing and to hear the views of the electorate. It would appear I am doing his job for him,” said McAnulty.</p>
<p>“We have invited him, via phone and email, to speak or simply to listen to the public. We offered to fit in with his schedule but he has not replied.</p>
<p>“I’m concerned at how this makes Wairarapa look. As one of the few to speak against the Bill Mr Hayes has been reported widely. The entire country now thinks that Wairarapa fears &#39;the extension of marriage to include relationships we do not as a society currently condone: polygamous and incestuous relationships&#39;.”</p>

<p>“Wairarapa elected the world’s first transgender MP – do we really link same-sex marriage to polygamy and incest or are Hayes’ own muddled views being portrayed as those of his constituents?</p>
<p>“Ironically, this was a conscience issue, Hayes could have voted in accordance with his views. Instead he hides behind us.</p>
<p>“The time for hiding is over, it is time for Hayes to front up to his constituents,” Mr. McAnulty said.<br><em><strong>Ends</strong></em>  </p>
