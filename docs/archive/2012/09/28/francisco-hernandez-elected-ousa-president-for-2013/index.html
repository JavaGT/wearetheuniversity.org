<p><strong>Francisco Hernandez Elected OUSA President for 2013</strong></p>
<p>This week the students of Otago University voted Francisco Hernandez, a current Masters student, into the leadership role for the 2013 year.</p>
<p>&quot;I am excited about the challenge, &quot;said Francisco Hernandez, OUSA President Elect 2013, &quot;I want to thank all the students that voted for me and I promise to work for all students.”</p>
<p>“The OUSA is in good hands for 2013,&quot; Said Logan Edgar, OUSA President.</p>
<p>But students weren&#39;t just voting for their new OUSA student executive representatives, they were voting to give the nation a finger on the pulse of student opinion. Over 3,000 students this week put forward their opinions on two of the nations hot topics; the sale of state owned energy companies, and same sex marriage.</p>
<p>Student opinion was obvious with voters 63% in favour of OUSA opposing the sale of the electricity companies, and 84% in favour of supporting same sex marriage.</p>
<p>“Students have spoken and the OUSA will faithfully push their views forward,” said Hernandez.</p>
<p>Other hot topics such as whether OUSA should support the University going smoke-free and whether or not OUSA should actively support pushing for postgraduate students to receive a student allowance also received support from the majority of voters.</p>
<p>The OUSA 2013 Executive will take charge of OUSA on the 1st of January 2013 after a handover and induction with the current Executive.</p>
