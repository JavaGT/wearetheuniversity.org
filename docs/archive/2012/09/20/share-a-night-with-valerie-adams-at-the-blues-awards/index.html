<p>Share a night with Valerie Adams at the Blues Awards</p>
<p>Aucklanders who missed out at the chance to watch Valerie Adams being awarded her gold medal in Auckland have a chance to listen to her speak at the Massey University Albany Blues Awards, being held at the ASB Room in the North Harbour Stadium on Tuesday October 2.</p>
<p>The Blues Awards are presented to students in recognition of their outstanding achievements in both sport and academic studies. Previous recipients include Hamish Bond, Lisa Carrington, Simon Child and Juliette Haigh.</p>
<p>MC Hamish McKay will guide the evening’s events, and Ms Adams will answer questions put to her in an ‘on the couch’ question and answer session.</p>
<p>In addition, to celebrate the success of Massey’s athletes at the Olympics, a number of Olympians will be attending the dinner, including sailing gold medallists Jo Aleh and Olivia Powrie, rowers Rebecca Scown (who won a bronze medal), Louise Ayling and Michael Arms, heptathlete Sarah Cowley, and swimmer Penelope Marshall.</p>
<p>Campus Registrar Andrea Davies is excited by the opportunity to share the celebration with the wider Auckland population.</p>
<p>“We thought it was a fantastic opportunity to celebrate our Olympians, and find out who the next batch of Olympic athletes could be,” she says. “If you’re a young athlete, how inspiring would it be to share a room with your Olympic heroes? We’ve had great feedback from the local sports community, schools and local businesses, so it should be a night to remember.”</p>
<p>The event starts at 6.15 pm with pre-dinner drinks, followed by a seated dinner. Dress code is formal (jacket and tie).</p>
<p>Massey University students and graduates accounted for 54 of the 184 New Zealand Olympic team members, and the university would have placed 27th on the medal table if it were a country.</p>
<p>Tickets are on sale now and cost $85 per ticket, or $680 for a table of 8, with special pricing for schools.
