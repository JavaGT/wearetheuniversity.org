<p><strong>Christchurch education plan will have far-reaching impact - NZEI</strong></p>
<p>The Government’s plans for the future of primary education in Christchurch are far more wide-reaching than what had been previously indicated, says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President Ian Leckie.</p>
<p>Mr Leckie, who’s in Christchurch for today’s announcement, says the changes are essentially a reorganization of education provision across the entire Christchurch area.</p>
<p>The changes will affect around 15 percent of schools and potentially involve the loss of hundreds of skilled teachers, principals and support staff.</p>
<p>“The closure of 13 schools and merging of a further 18 including the establishment of five new area schools for students from years 1-13 will have a major impact on students throughout the area.”</p>
<p>Mr Leckie says there’s already a high degree of stress among students and teachers and it is important that these changes allow for both continuity and certainty.</p>
<p>“We are concerned to see that no child misses out or is disadvantaged because of these changes.</p>
<p>“Intermediate schools in Christchurch have been hit particularly hard and the closing and merging of these schools severely threatens the strength and emphasis of intermediate and middle schooling in the city.”  </p>
