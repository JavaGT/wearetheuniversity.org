<p>Ruth Dyson<br>Port Hills MP</p>
<p>13 September 2012</p>
<p><strong>What the Hekia? Get it right, Minister!</strong></p>
<p>The Education Minister, Hekia Parata, should be calling the principals of Christchurch’s Shirley Boys’ High and Avonside Girls’ High to explain the incomprehensible information about the schools’ future, says Ruth Dyson.</p>
<p>In today’s education renewal plan for Christchurch, Avonside Girls’ was described as “continues, close, merge, new and dual-shift.” Shirley Boys’ High was described as “close, merge and dual-shift.”</p>
<p>“If it wasn’t so serious, it would be laughable.</p>
<p>“These schools and their communities have gone through more than enough in the last two years. All they were looking for today was some certainty.</p>
<p>“Why on earth did the Minister sign off on this document? Did she even read it?</p>
<p>“I’ve now had confirmation from the Minister’s office that no decisions can be made on either school until further geo-tech information on their land is available, and that won’t be until Christmas.</p>
<p>“This isn’t hard information to tell people. They just want the truth so they can get on with planning their lives.</p>
<p>“Hekia Parata owes the principals, teachers, students and families of both schools an apology,” says Ruth Dyson.</p>
<p>Documents which show the future options for Shirley Boys High and Avonside Girls High in the plan released by the Government today are available <a href="http://img.scoop.co.nz/media/pdfs/1209/SKMBT_C353_12091316220.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://img.scoop.co.nz/media/pdfs/1209/SKMBT_C353_12091316230.pdf">here</a>.</p>
