<p><strong>Sky City profits sky high: no need to subsidise conference centre</strong></p>
<p>Sky City’s record profits released today highlight how unnecessary it is for the Government to change legislation in exchange for a new convention centre, says the Green Party.</p>
<p>Green Party gambling spokesperson Denise Roche questioned why such a profitable company was relying on a “Government hand out”.</p>
<p>“It’s outrageous that the Government is prepared to increase the legal number of pokies and gambling tables just so a corporate winner will build a place for people to have conferences,” said Ms Roche</p>
<p>&quot;The business case for a new convention centre should stand on its own and not require the Government to subsidise a private company making record profits at great social cost to the community.</p>
<p>“The Government and Sky City Casino are capitalising on other’s vulnerabilities. Their plan puts thousands of Aucklanders at greater risk of suffering from gambling problems just so they can get a building built.</p>
<p>“It’s morally bankrupt.”</p>
<p>The Green Party opposes the Government’s proposed deal with Sky City to expand its gambling operations in Auckland.</p>
<p>“We want to see the Government implementing practical measures to reduce gambling harm. We need to reduce, not increase, the harmful impacts of gambling,” Ms Roche said.</p>
<p>In exchange for Sky City building a conference centre in central Auckland, the Government is understood to be considering allowing the casino to increase its legal number of gambling tables and pokie machines.</p>
<p>Sky City this morning publicised record profit for the six months leading up to December 31. The Gambling giant’s net profit after tax was up 17 percent.</p>
