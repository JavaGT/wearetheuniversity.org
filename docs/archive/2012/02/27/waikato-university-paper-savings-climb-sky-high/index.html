<p><strong>Uni paper savings climb sky high</strong></p>
<p>The University of Waikato has reduced its yearly paper usage by the height of two Sky Towers thanks to a new online purchasing system.</p>
<p>In the 2010-2011 financial year, the university bought 13,573 (29%) fewer reams of A4 photocopy paper than in the previous one.</p>
<p>That equates to 45 pallets of printing paper, and if those reams were stacked on top of one another, they would be taller than the height of two and a quarter Sky Towers.</p>
<p>The system, UniMarket, emails purchase orders and invoices directly to suppliers, eliminating the need for printing, photocopying and faxing. It saved $78,000 on photocopy paper, ink and toner usage in that financial year.</p>
<p>While the change has resulted in financial savings, it has also reduced the university’s environmental impact, says the university’s Environmental and Sustainability Coordinator Rachael Goddard.</p>
<p>“We’ve saved approximately 57 pine trees – one 25 metre tall tree makes around 119,100 sheets of paper, and each ream contains 500 sheets. Our paper is chlorine-free and the mill it comes from is environmentally certified,” says Ms Goddard.</p>
<p>She says as well as the new online ordering system, individual staff members have also helped to reduce paper waste.</p>
<p>Ms Goddard was appointed last year to manage the university of Waikato’s ongoing commitment to sustainability, and upcoming projects include an environmental purchasing policy and waste minimisation strategy for the university.</p>
