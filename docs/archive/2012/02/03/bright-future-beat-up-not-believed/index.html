<p>David Cunliffe<br>Economic Development Spokesperson</p>
<p>3 February 2012</p>
<p><strong>Bright future beat-up not believed</strong></p>
<p>The flood of Kiwis voting no confidence in the National-led NZ economy continues to rise, Labour’s Economic Development Spokesperson David Cunliffe says.</p>
<p>“A record number of New Zealanders left our shores in 2011, with a gross loss of 45,863 to Australia alone. That brings the total brain drain to that country under John Key to an astounding 116,550.</p>
<p>“That’s roughly the population of Hamilton or Dunedin packing up and leaving because they have no hope of a better life in John Key&#39;s version of Godzone. They have decided the only ‘brighter future’ they can see lies offshore,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“The exodus can’t be glibly passed off as the effects of Canterbury earthquakes. These people are going for very real reasons.</p>
<p>&quot;Australia largely avoided the global recession because of enlightened policies introduced by its Labour government.</p>
<p>“It has an unemployment rate of 5.5percent; New Zealand’s is 6.5 per cent. According to a Bloomberg report today the average weekly wage in New Zealand is 40 per cent less than in Australia.</p>
<p>“Food and living costs continue to soar, yet wages are stagnant. Who could blame individual families for wanting to do their best to provide for their kids?</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t be falling behind. It is not just minerals, nor even Australia&#39;s compulsory savings scheme that National lacks the courage to adopt in New Zealand. Australia has had a real plan for economic development, a plan similar to the one the Economic Development briefing papers to the Minister call for.</p>
<p>“As the briefings made clear, successive rounds of austerity are not a substitute for a real plan for economic growth and development.</p>
<p>“There are real choices for New Zealanders besides packing up and heading across the Tasman.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately for a net 116,500 of them, National offered none,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
