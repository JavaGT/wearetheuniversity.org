<p>A game created by three University of Waikato graduates was voted site favourite at the Waikato leg of the 48 hour Global Game Jam.</p>
<p>Catch Me If You Can, a multiplayer racing game, was created by Jacob Toye, Dave Leaver and Jeremy Moore and inspired by Nintendo 64 classic game Mario Kart.</p>
<p>All three graduated from Waikato around five years ago and now work as programmers and developers at Smartrak, a GPS tracking and fleet management company based in Hamilton.</p>
<p>Global Game Jam brings computer enthusiasts together to create video and board games every January. It encourages experimentation and innovation - participants come together for 48 hours, form teams, and develop games around a theme that is announced at the start of the event.</p>
<p>Team leader Jacob Toye says the most important thing behind creating the 2D game was ensuring it was easy to grasp and fun to play.</p>
<p>“Catch Me If You Can is a running race game with the bonus of power-ups. You race against your opponent over platforms and through water, all the time having to duck and jump over obstacles.</p>
<p>“As the game took shape we decided to add power-ups, things like bombs, boosts and fish projectiles, which you pick up during the race and can use against your opponents.”</p>
<p>Four players can race against each other at once, controlling either by keyboard or through an Xbox controller.</p>

<p>“Towards the end of day two we had people playing the game who would stay on and play a couple of rounds which was really encouraging,” says Dave.</p>
<p>Each year the University of Waikato hosts a leg of the Global Game Jam. Organiser and computer science senior lecturer Bill Rogers said this year 50 programmers, designers and artists met at the university to take part.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see graduates come back to participate.”<br>ends</p>
