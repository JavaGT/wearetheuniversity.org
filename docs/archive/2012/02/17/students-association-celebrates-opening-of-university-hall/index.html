<p><strong>Students&#39; Association celebrates the opening of University Hall</strong></p>
<p>The University of Auckland opened the new student accommodation complex tonight. University Hall will provide housing and catering for 442 students in the coming year.</p>
<p>Auckland University Students&#39; Association is positive about the new hall. &quot;Auckland rent prices are keeping students out of the central city. Its great to see the University taking steps to help students live closer to where they study,&quot; says Auckland University Students&#39; Association President, Arena Williams. &quot;Hopefully this will have some effect on the inner city rental market, and allow 442 other students to find flats elsewhere.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;$330 a week to live in the new hall is steep for rent and expenses, but subsidising it further from the Student Services Levy wouldn&#39;t be appropriate. That money should be spent of services that everyone can access, like the University Health Service or the academic advocacy service.&quot;</p>
<p>Arena Williams says the Students&#39; Association is always sceptical about University spending on things which don&#39;t benefit the majority of students, but that on balance the University Hall addressed a real need.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;d like see more equitable rules about who gets priority to live here. There should be a preference for the most vulnerable students who struggle to find suitable accommodation for the academic year, rather than top high school scholars and sports-people.&quot;</p>
