<p><strong>‘Up and coming’ sport and future leader scholars welcomed on campus</strong></p>
<p>A new beginning is now underway for Lincoln University’s new batch of sport and future leader scholars as they were officially welcomed to the University by Vice-Chancellor Professor Roger Field.</p>
<p>The sport scholarship programme, now in its 14th year, provides an opportunity for a select group of students to gain a world-class academic qualification and develop their sporting ability to a professional level.</p>
<p>The future leader scholarship programme, now in its 7th year, assists students of high academic calibre and to realise their leadership potential while undertaking tertiary study.</p>
<p>Along with their family and friends, 39 sport and 40 future leader scholarship recipients were officially welcomed and given their respective scholarship polo shirts.</p>
<p>“These students are starting a new and exciting chapter in their life and starting University can be overwhelming. Over the next three to four days, these students will have a thorough orientation, preparing them for the exciting year ahead,” says Lincoln University Scholarships Manager Jane Edwards.</p>
<p>“Both scholarship programmes require immense commitment from the students. However, at the end these students will be leaving the University with their degree, fully equipped to take advantage of the range of opportunities life will present to them.”</p>
