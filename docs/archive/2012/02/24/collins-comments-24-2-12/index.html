<p><strong>Collins Comments</strong></p>
<p>This month we pay tribute to the people of <strong>Canterbury</strong> as we commemorate the one year anniversary of the devasting earthquake that struck Christchurch on 22 February - on this day Christchurch and, indeed, all of New Zealand was changed for ever.</p>
<p>My thoughts are with the friends and families of those who lost loved ones and, with all the people of Canterbury, who have lived through so much.</p>
<p>It is also important to reflect on what has been achieved over the past year in terms of getting Canterbury back on its feet.</p>
<p>We are making good progress. The Government has committed <strong>$5.5 billion</strong> to the <strong>Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Fund</strong> to provide certainty for rebuilding the region.</p>
<p>Construction is underway on 26 significant commercial buildings in the central city. The Restart the Heart shopping area in Cashel Mall is back on its feet as a thriving hub, drawing Cantabrians back to the central city and a new Christchurch Stadium being built in Addington.</p>
<p>This is the Government’s commitment to New Zealand. And while Christchurch will look different to what it did before, it will be a vibrant, new, and great place to live.</p>
<p>*<br>Back in the Electorate I was pleased to open the new <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nznationalparty/6777956458/in/photostream"><strong>Community Probation Service Centre</strong></a> on behalf of my colleague Hon Anne Tolley, Minister of Corrections.</p>

<p>The new centre means that the 35 probation service staff responsible for managing around 1,000 community based sentences in Papakura will no longer have to work across two separate sites.</p>
<p>Our dedicated staff do a great job to ensure a smooth reintegration back into life after prison by building connections with offenders’ families, community groups and agencies and I trust the new centre will make this process easier.</p>

<p>It was great to visit the community at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nznationalparty/6924065101/in/photostream"><strong>Taka Park</strong></a> in <strong>Takanini</strong> recently to celebrate the $250,000 plan to upgrade their reserve - including a new basketball court, flying fox, and skate park.</p>
<p>On behalf of the local community I&#39;d like to thank the Auckland Council and Takanini&#39;s Neighbourhood Policing Team for their generous support of the project. I look forward to visiting the new-look park soon!</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I was delighted to hear four <strong>Strathallan School</strong> students topped New Zealand and the World in their Cambridge exams with a 100 percent pass rate - a result achieved by only eight students nationwide.</p>
<p>I congratulate <strong>Tarika Sabherwal</strong> and <strong>Tingjian He</strong> (Top in the World for IGCSE Art and Design), <strong>Jordan Jeffcoat</strong> (Top in the World for Literature) and <strong>Melissa Kelsey</strong> (Top in New Zealand for AS Art and Design). Your outstanding results reflect a great deal of talent, dedication and commitment to achieving excellence. Well done - I wish you great success with your future endeavours.</p>
<p><strong>Hon Judith Collins</strong><br>MP for Papakura</p>
<p>ENDS  </p>
