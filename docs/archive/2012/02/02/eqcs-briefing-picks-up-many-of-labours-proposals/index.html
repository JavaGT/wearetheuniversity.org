<p><strong>EQC’s briefing picks up many of Labour’s proposals</strong></p>
<p>Labour’s commitment to reviewing the workings of the Earthquake Commission (EQC) in light of the Canterbury earthquake experience has been vindicated in EQC’s briefing to the incoming Minister, Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Lianne Dalziel says.</p>
<p>“In proposing various aspects of the scheme be considered in a wide-ranging review, the Commission picks up many of Labour’s suggestions.</p>
<p>“However there are also a number of aspects where we need to have further discussion – a proposal to exclude contents cover is clearly one of those, as is the continued hiking of the earthquake levy which has already more than doubled,” Lianne Dalziel said.</p>
<p>“Interestingly Labour’s proposal to look at introducing a levy on land cover and introducing some proportionality in the EQC levy was greeted with scorn by the Minister.</p>
<p>“Now EQC is suggesting the review consider exactly that.</p>
<p>“There are other issues that Labour would like to see reviewed, including the mechanism for collecting levies – our proposal included adding it to the rates system to ensure universal coverage for natural disasters.</p>
<p>“Any review, of course, needs to consider a range of options. Labour would welcome such a review, and is fully prepared to engage in the process with the Government,” Lianne Dalziel said.</p>
