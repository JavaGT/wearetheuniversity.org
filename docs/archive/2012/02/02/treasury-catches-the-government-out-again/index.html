<p><strong>Treasury catches the Government out again</strong></p>
<p>The Treasury has caught the Government out once again with its briefing paper revealing that National is considering plans to increase class sizes, says Labour’s Associate Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins.</p>
<p>“The slip has occurred despite Education Minister Hekia Parata trying to hide the Government’s intention by removing the only mention of the ill-considered strategy from the Education Ministry’s briefing papers,” Chris Hipkins said.</p>
<p>“Sources have told me that the Ministry’s briefing actually said: ‘Managing cost pressures in coming years will require changes to system settings and formulas which drive the resourcing of schools, including consideration of teacher-to-student ratios.’</p>
<p>“This sentence has been withheld in the briefing released today,” Chris Hipkins said.</p>
<p>“Hekia Parata obviously didn’t want New Zealanders to know of the National-led Government’s plans to make class sizes bigger, and was counting on the Treasury removing this advice.</p>
<p>“It’s alarming to see the Ministry suggesting further funding cuts could be accommodated by making class sizes bigger. They code this by talking about ‘consideration of teacher-to-student ratios’ but it can only mean one thing – more kids in each class.</p>
<p>“Cheaper might be better when it comes to buying pens and papers, but our children’s future should not be at the mercy of the distorted priorities of this short-sighted government, which wants to cut budgets no matter what the real long-term cost,” Chris Hipkins said.</p>
<p>“The idea that cheaper equals better-quality education is simply bizarre and doesn’t make sense.”</p>
