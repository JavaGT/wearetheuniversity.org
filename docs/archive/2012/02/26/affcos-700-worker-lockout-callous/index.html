<p><strong>Affco’s 700-worker lockout callous</strong></p>
<p>Affco’s plan to lockout 762 workers from five sites on Wednesday is an appalling reaction to its disagreement regarding workers’ rights, says the Green Party.</p>
<p>Green Party industrial relations spokesperson Denise Roche said Talley’s Group Limited, which owns Affco, had an awful record of mistreating workers and could not be trusted to negotiate a collective employment contract in good faith.</p>
<p>“The workers shouldn’t have to accept the casualisation of their jobs for Talley’s to agree to the collective employment contracts,” Ms Roche said.</p>
<p>Talley’s demands included forcing staff into working with flexible rosters and shift hours, and having no guarantee of work.</p>
<p>“It’s appalling that such a profitable company is using its might to bully low-paid staff into accepting such unreasonable terms of employment.</p>
<p>“Imagine what it’s like living day-by-day not knowing whether you can make enough money to feed your family.”</p>
<p>“Teachers and office workers wouldn’t put up with such callous demands, and neither should factory workers in small towns. No one should,” Ms Roche said.</p>
<p>“We condemn families to poverty when we take away the breadwinners’ assurance of work.”</p>
<p>Talley’s planned to lock out workers on Wednesday, February 29, from its North Island works in Moerewa, Manawatu, Imlay (Wanganui), Horotiu (Waikato) and Wairoa.</p>
<p>The lockout notice follows an 18 month dispute over the collective employment agreement.</p>
<p>The food giant last year recorded $21 million net profit.</p>

<p>The Employment Relations Authority this month ordered Talley’s-Affco to pay a $30,000 fine to the Meatworkers Union for blocking union representatives from its Awarua meatworks near Invercargill.</p>
<p>Ms Roche will today join the picket line at the Ports of Auckland where maritime workers are facing similar issues with threats to their livelihoods.  </p>
