<p><strong>Eco-my-flat turns five and opens its doors to the public</strong></p>
<p>Eco-my-flat the competition where students eco their lives is packing its (organic, home-grown) lunch in its (second-hand) back pack, pulling up its socks and getting ready for the next big adventure – a new era of the competition.</p>
<p>In celebration of eco-my-flat’s fifth year, the University of Canterbury’s Sustainability Office has introduced a few changes.</p>
<p>Eco-my-flat coordinator Dr Sharon McIver said that the ‘competition’ tag has been dropped and instead they have decided to go with the direction Christchurch is heading in - an eco-my-flat community open event.</p>
<p>“Eco-my-flat will not only be open to students and staff at the University, but to anyone willing to share their experiences of trying to become more sustainable,” she said.</p>
<p>“And, in the hope of making eco-my-flat the most desirable location on the web, we’ve added a Facebook page where flats, sponsors, media, whānau, and fans will be able to share resources and, most importantly, tell everyone about what they’re doing to make life more eco.”</p>
<p>Eco-my-flat runs from March to May and is one of the many initiatives to highlight issues around sustainability and, hopefully, prompt a better environmentally friendly lifestyle choice said Dr McIver.</p>
<p>“The competition is very popular and we have seen some brilliant initiatives over the years. One year students produced electricity from a flat exercycle and a DIY wind generator. Others include the wonders of white vinegar and baking soda.”</p>
<p>A number of prizes will be available and spot prizes will be given away online. Participants are required to write blogs and the spot prizes will be awarded during the blogging.</p>
<p>“The blogs are great way for people to get tips and advice from those who are participating. We want everyone to gain something from eco-my-flat, be it preserving, baking or bubble wrapping hallway windows.”</p>
<p>People wishing to know more about eco-my-flat can simply ‘like’ it on Facebook, or phone, email, post or visit the UC Sustainability Office at Sustainability House, 118 Ilam Road.</p>
<p>“Join eco-my-flat and become a part of the friendliest, generous, most sustainable flat in town,” Dr McIver said.</p>
<p>Eco-my-flat will also be holding workshops during the competition that anyone is welcome to attend.</p>
<p>Workshops will take place on Wednesdays, 5-6pm, at Sustainability House, 118 Ilam Road. All prospective attendees must register by signing up at: <a href="http://www.sustain.canterbury.ac.nz/ecomyflat/form.shtml">http://www.sustain.canterbury.ac.nz/ecomyflat/form.shtml</a> .</p>
