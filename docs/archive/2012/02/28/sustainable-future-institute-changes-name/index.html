<p><strong>Tuesday, 28 February 2012, 12:19 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/McGuinness_Institute">McGuinness Institute</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>News for Immediate Release:</strong></p>
<p><strong>February 28, 2012</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Future Institute Changes Name to McGuinness Institute:</strong><br><strong><em>New Name Better Reflects the Institute’s Research Scope</em></strong></p>
<p>The Sustainable Future Institute announced today that the Institute’s directorial team approved a name change to the McGuinness Institute.</p>
<p>The name change is effective from February 28, 2012.</p>
<p>Wendy McGuinness, Chief Executive, believes this change reflects international best practice, making transparent both where the principal funds are coming from, and the purpose; namely private funds invested for the public good.</p>
<p>The Institute has become increasingly aware of misconceptions concerning the nature of our work arising from the use of the word <em>sustainable</em>.</p>
<p>Rather than being seen as an organisation primarily focused on progressing environmental issues, the name change better reflects the breadth of the Institute’s work; exploring New Zealand’s long- term future through integrated evidence-based research on social, economic and environmental issues.</p>
<p>The McGuinness Institute is a non-partisan think tank working for the public good, contributing strategic foresight through evidence-based research and policy analysis.</p>
<p>We endeavor to undertake research that is independent, innovative and relevant in a professional manner.</p>
<p>Further, the McGuinness Institute places a great value on inclusiveness and accessibility and works hard to respect cultural and demographic diversity.</p>
<p>The McGuinness Institute operates with a diverse team of graduates, academics and experienced professionals with expertise in a multitude of disciplines, who are all focused on working towards better long-term outcomes for New Zealand.</p>
<p>The McGuinness Institute is very fortunate to have the help, advice and support of many experts who guide the team through the process and externally review all publications.</p>
<p>Further, the McGuinness Institute has a number of international affiliations and relationships which ensure an informed global view is incorporated into our research and policy recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Major Projects of the McGuinness Institute: Project 2058</strong></p>
<p>Earlier work by the McGuinness Institute found that New Zealand is well behind on its international obligations to develop and implement a National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS).</p>
<p>The strategic aim of <em>Project 2058</em> is therefore to promote integrated long-term thinking, leadership and capacity-building through the development of an NSDS that effectively seeks and creates opportunities while simultaneously exploring and managing risks over the next 50 years.</p>
<p>It is hoped that <em>Project 2058</em> will help develop dialogue among government ministers, parliamentarians, policy analysts and members of the public about alternative strategies for New Zealand’s future.</p>
<p><strong>Project: Constitutional Review</strong></p>
<p>The aim of this project is to build capacity so that New Zealanders – in particular youth between the ages of 18–25 – can engage with the Constitutional Advisory Panel in an informed and considered manner.</p>
<p>This project has two main work streams.</p>
<p>Firstly, the McGuinness Institute is closely following the progress of the Constitutional Advisory Panel and will report and research key issues as they arise.</p>
<p>Secondly, the <em>Empower</em> project aims to facilitate discussion amongst young people around the constitutional review and New Zealand&#39;s long-term future.</p>
<p>The McGuinness Institute is working to create a space and place to enable young people to connect, discuss and explore New Zealand&#39;s future constitutional arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>Project One Integrated Report</strong></p>
<p>The McGuinness Institute believes the use of one integrated annual report, by both organisations and countries, is a critical mechanism for improving global governance of resources, human health and well-being.</p>
<p>The creation of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) is a positive step towards the formation of this framework, and the Institute has introduced the current stream of work in support of this initiative.</p>
<p>The McGuinness Institute considers it is now time to plan how to move from a financial reporting framework to an integrated reporting framework.</p>
