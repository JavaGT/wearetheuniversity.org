<p><strong>Tuesday, 28 February 2012, 3:11 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Iain<br>LEES-GALLOWAY<br>Associate Health Spokesperson<br>28 February 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Labour supports smoke-free NZ by 2025</strong></p>
<p>The political consensus on tobacco control established in the last term of Parliament must continue if New Zealand is to become smoke-free by 2025, says Labour’s Associate Health spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway.</p>
<p>Commenting on research published today by the University of Otago, Iain Lees-Galloway said that with the National Party finally laying down their guns and joining the team working to reduce tobacco-related harm, the opportunity to quicken the decline in smoking rates in New Zealand has never been greater.</p>
<p>“Increases to tobacco excise tax and the soon-to-be-implemented removal of point-of-sale tobacco displays were excellent additions to the incremental efforts to tackle smoking rates made over the last 25 years. The Government should introduce plain packaging this year and look to make further changes in this term.</p>
<p>“Australia is facing a legal challenge from tobacco companies over its decision to introduce plain packaging. That same tactic may well be used against New Zealand. We should move quickly to ensure this vital next step isn’t unnecessarily delayed.</p>
<p>“The Government must also ensure that New Zealand’s sovereign right to set its own public health policy continues to be maintained in any trade agreements entered into. This has been done successfully in all trade negotiations thus far and there is no reason that should change in the future.</p>

<p>“The Ministry of Health identified reducing the harm caused by smoking related diseases as a priority opportunity to improve the wellbeing of the nation and reduce avoidable disease and cost to the health system. The achievements of last term are no reason to rest on our laurels. They are an opportunity to put our foot on the accelerator and make New Zealand smoke-free by 2025,” said Iain Lees-Galloway.</p>
