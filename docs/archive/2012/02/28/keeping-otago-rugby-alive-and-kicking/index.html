<p><strong>Keeping Otago rugby alive and kicking</strong></p>
<p>Dunedin Labour MPs Clare Curran and David Clark have swung in behind the beleaguered Otago Rugby Football Union, saying the province has a fine and long rugby tradition.</p>
<p>After over 130 years of supporting rugby in the region, the ORFU announced yesterday that it was unable to manage its debt of over $2.2 million and would apply to the High Court for liquidation on Friday.</p>
<p>“We believe Otago can and should have functioning rugby teams at the highest level,” Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>“The important priorities right now are to ensure that our community supports local clubs, that our kids continue to play rugby and that the clubs continue to function.</p>
<p>“Any moves to develop a rescue package which would ensure Otago has a team competing in this year’s ITM will also have our support,” Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>David Clark said the unexpectedness of yesterday’s announcement would have taken many people by surprise.</p>
<p>“However, hope remains. We note that last year the National Union contributed to a bailout for Rugby Southland,” he said.</p>
<p>Despite the grim news both MPs are committed to supporting the on-going future of rugby in the province and are encouraging the community to do the same.</p>
<p>“Local clubs are hugely important, not only because they keep our kids involved in the sport, but because they act as focal points for our communities,” said Clare Curran.</p>
<p>“The support of the NZRU has been great,” David Clark said. “I would really encourage the community to get involved and help keep both local and bigger events running.”</p>
