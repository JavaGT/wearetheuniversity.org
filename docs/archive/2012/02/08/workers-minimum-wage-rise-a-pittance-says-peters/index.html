<p><strong>Wednesday, 8 February 2012, 1:55 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters<br>Leader NZ First</p>
<p>8 February 2012</p>
<p><strong>Workers Minimum Wage Rise A Pittance, ays Peters</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First describes the fifty cents an hour minimum wage rise as an insulting pittance.</p>
<p>The minimum wage will increase from $13 to $13.50 an hour and the training and new entrant minimum wage will increase from $10.40 to $10.80.</p>
<p>New Zealand First says the minimum wage should be at least $15 an hour.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters says the skinflint wage increase will not even cover power price rises let alone the rise in the cost of food items.</p>
<p>“This is the government that gave huge tax cuts to its rich mates.</p>
<p>“Remember the boss of Westpac got more than five thousand dollars a week in tax cuts while the workers had to pay higher GST on the cost of everything to pay for these tax cuts.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders who believe in a fair go know this government has one set of privileges for the rich while the poor slide further into poverty.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says all the parties that form the government should feel ashamed, especially the Maori Party.</p>
<p>“Everybody knows that National has a callous disregard for workers but the Maori Party claims to stick up for Maori people on low incomes.</p>
<p>“The reality is the gap between rich and poor is growing all the time and the Maori Party is just as guilty as National,” says Mr Peters.</p>
