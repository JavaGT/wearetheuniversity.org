<p>Christchurch dining outlets are flat-out after two years of upheaval, says UC marketing expert</p>
<p>December 10, 2012</p>
<p>A University of Canterbury (UC) marketing lecturer says Christchurch restaurants, bars and cafes are flat-out after two years of upheaval.</p>
<p>More than 543 cafes, restaurants and bars are now open in the city – or 50 percent of the 1094 restaurants that were open before the earthquakes, UC senior marketing lecturer Dr Sussie Morrish said today.</p>
<p>A majority of the restaurants are in the central city (22 percent) or in the western suburbs especially Riccarton and surrounding areas (24 percent). Dr Morrish said Christchurch outlets were doing a roaring trade in the days heading to Christmas and the holiday period.</p>
<p>``We’ve heard people trying to book tables for a meal out and restaurants are virtually fully booked. It’s great news for operators who have had a couple of tough years following the earthquakes.</p>
<p>``More planning will be needed next year to cater for the anticipated influx of workers and more visitors as the rebuild really kicks off. We must use the Christmas break to re-charge and then plan strategically for the future.’’</p>
<p>The Canterbury Business Association has presented a blueprint for a potential significant international food village in the central city which is being considered by authorities including CERA.</p>
<p>Dr Morrish said it had been a tough year for restaurant and cafe operators but 2013 was looming as an exciting time as the city got on with the rebuild. The operators had done a great job in adversity in servicing the hospitality needs of the people of Christchurch and visitors in the last two years.</p>

<p>``I can’t see a slackening off in demand over the school holidays with more visitors and impromptu dining out. Patrons of the old Dux de Lux who have missed the food and ambience of the place can now experience their cuisine again.</p>
<p>``The Twisted Hop is brewing from Wigram and their ales have been available at the Woolston Hop since October. Their English style ales are also available in seven other outlets around the country.</p>
<p>``We Cantabrians are a very mobile lot so we will go where the action is. If there are events in the four avenues worth going to, you will find people will be there no matter what part of town they are from.</p>
<p>``The busy time for the food and drink services sector will probably peak in the two weeks before Christmas. As soon as the school holidays kick in, it will be more family time with Christmas preparation on top of everyone’s agenda,’’ Dr Morrish said.</p>
