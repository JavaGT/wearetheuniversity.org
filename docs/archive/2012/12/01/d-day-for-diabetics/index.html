<p><strong>Saturday, 1 December 2012, 1:22 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Maryan<br>STREET<br>Health Spokesperson</p>
<p>1 December 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>D-Day for diabetics</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of Kiwi diabetics are having to switch to using new blood glucose meters from today in a move many say will disrupt their management of what can be a life-threatening illness, but the government argues will save $10 million, Labour&#39;s Health spokesperson Maryan Street says.</p>
<p>&quot;Pharmac&#39;s decision to give the contract for blood glucose meters to a sole supplier has caused considerable distress for New Zealand&#39;s 200,000 diabetics, who rely on the meters to manage their chronic illness.</p>
<p>&quot;Funding for the meters ceases from today, while the test strips which supply the blood to the meter will cease to be subsidised on 1 March next year.<br>“The move - which means patients can only source the product from one supplier as opposed to a choice of three - is designed to save money. Pharmaco, the company contracted to provide these new meters, is rolling out some support and education but whether or not that&#39;s successful is another matter.</p>
<p>&quot;The real pressure will come on 1 March. Health professionals such as pharmacists and GPs will have to be trained in the use of the new meters so they can pass that on to patients.<br>“And despite the fact Pharmaco is holding &#39;Meet your Meter&#39; sessions for people, the big concern is that it has underestimated the resources needed to do this training and retraining job.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a huge disruption for people with diabetes. We just have to hope that it doesn&#39;t turn into a &#39;Meet your Maker&#39; event for any of them.&quot;</p>
