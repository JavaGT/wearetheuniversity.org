<p><strong>University leader’s award ‘highly deserved’ says Lincoln Chancellor</strong></p>
<p>The Officer of New Zealand Order of Merit (ONZM) awarded to retired Lincoln University Vice-Chancellor Emeritus Professor Roger Field was highly deserved recognition for a tertiary education leader who had given his heart and soul to serving New Zealand’s land-based interests through management of New Zealand’s specialist land-based university, said Lincoln University’s Chancellor Tom Lambie.</p>
<p>“The Lincoln University community is delighted that Professor Field’s career of more than 40 years as a university teacher, researcher and manager has been acknowledged in this way.</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s land-based industries are the powerhouse of our economy and through leadership at Lincoln University first as a Professor of Plant Science, then over the years 1993 – 2012 as progressively Pro Vice-Chancellor, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Acting Vice-Chancellor and from 2004 Vice-Chancellor, Professor Field has made a remarkable contribution.</p>
<p>“The fruits of his leadership are to be seen in the thousands of graduates throughout New Zealand and the world who hold their qualifications from Lincoln University.</p>
<p>“Most recently the breadth and strength of Professor Field’s management skills were well seen in his leadership of the University during the period of the Canterbury earthquakes.</p>
<p>“National recognition in the 2013 New Year Honours, through the ONZM for services to education and land-based industries, is very highly deserved,” said Mr Lambie.</p>
