<p>18 December 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Local home support agency gets short shrift from Government</strong></p>
<p>‘Tis the week before Christmas and while nothing is stirring - not even a mouse - local Labour MPs say they smell a rat in the awarding of a DHB contract to an Australian agency.</p>
<p>Dunedin MPs David Clark and Clare Curran believe the Government’s internationalist ideology is behind the dumping of Presbyterian Support Otago as a provider of home support to the Southern District Health Board.</p>
<p>“Presbyterian Support has run the home support services contract for 13 years, providing professional, local, and stable services for vulnerable clients,” Dr Clark said.</p>
<p>“It is hard to see what they have been doing wrong, given they are the largest provider locally and have demonstrated an ability to expand as required.</p>
<p>“The move has Tony Ryall’s fingerprints all over it. As Minister of Health, he has consistently favoured corporate solutions over local care.</p>
<p>“The process appears to have been a sham. The tender criteria were vague, plus there was critical information omitted. Just as shocking is that price was signalled as of low importance to the tender.”</p>
<p>Dunedin South MP Clare Curran said that a company with its roots outside of Dunedin - and more so the country - will struggle to provide the caring and loving local support network that PSO, the region’s largest home-care provider, has.</p>
<p>“The decision means an uncertain future for around 600 staff and 2000 clients.</p>
<p>“And while the human cost of this is tragic, there are also financial implications. Overseas companies with a strong profit motive taking over local service provision will have a detrimental effect on both elder-care and the Dunedin economy,” she said.</p>
