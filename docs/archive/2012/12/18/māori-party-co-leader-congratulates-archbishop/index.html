<p><strong>Māori Party co-leader congratulates Archbishop</strong></p>
<p>Māori Party co-leader, Tariana Turia, has congratulated Archbishop David Moxon on the international honour accorded to him, in being appointed the Anglican Communion’s Chief representative to the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>“Archbishop Moxon has been called to Rome, to broker an exciting new relationship between the Catholic and Anglican Churches” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“I have respected David’s leadership for many years now, and have been particularly impressed at the unique partnership model he has promoted in the three-tikanga model of the Anglican Church of Aotearoa New Zealand and Polynesia.</p>
<p>“Archbishop David’s experience in forging relationships and operating collectively, between tikanga Māori, tikanga Pasifika and tikanga Pākehā, will be invaluable in creating dialogue within the Anglican-Roman Catholic churches across the globe.</p>
<p>“As a nation, we should be so proud that the commitment to treaty justice has been recognised by this appointment. David, his wife Tureiti, and their whānau, have between them invested so much of their lives in demonstrating their love for the people.</p>

<p>“The Māori Party honours this whānau for their inspirational commitment to serving the people.</p>
