<p>Two UC education experts granted $130,000 to improve NZ students’ e-learning levels</p>
<p>December 12, 2012</p>
<p>Two University of Canterbury (UC) education experts have received a $130,000 Teaching and Learning Research Initiative grant to look at how school principals can effectively lead e-learning to improve student success.</p>
<p>Dr Julie Mackey and Professor Niki Davis, in partnership with school principals, will research innovative school leadership strategies to enable e-learning to lift student achievement.</p>
<p>``Our project will contribute to New Zealand’s e-Learning planning framework, as well as the international field of school technology leadership,’’ Professor Davis said today.</p>
<p>``We are working with Tawa Intermediate School, Belfast School, Churton Park School, Newlands Intermediate School and Levin Intermediate School on this project.</p>
<p>``This project is timely given the increasing investment in ultra-fast broadband for schools and the growing interest in how these technologies can be employed to enhance learning for diverse groups of students.’’</p>
<p>UC’s College of Education e-Learning Lab, directed by Professor Davis, has an international reputation for work in e-learning, blended learning and teacher education.</p>
<p>Next year will see the opening of the Network for Learning and by 2016 97.7 per cent of New Zealand schools and 99.9 per cent of students will receive ultra-fast broadband capability. See: <a href="http://elearning.tki.org.nz/">http://elearning.tki.org.nz/</a><br>ends</p>
