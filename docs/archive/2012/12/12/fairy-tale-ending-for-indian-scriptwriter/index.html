<p><strong>Fairy-tale ending for Indian scriptwriter</strong></p>
<p>A story about a brother in search of his estranged sister has scooped the prestigious David Carson-Parker Embassy Prize in Scriptwriting.</p>
<p>Vinay Choudary, a student at Victoria University’s International Institute of Modern Letters, won the prize for his script <em>The Bloody Mulligans</em>.</p>
<p>Vinay says the prize is a fairy-tale ending.</p>
<p>“I grew up in Bombay (now Mumbai), and after graduating from university in 1998, worked writing soap operas for Indian television. I felt burnt out and under-challenged with this work, and decided to step out of India and explore broader themes and issues in my writing.</p>
<p>“The prize makes the risk I took quitting television to go back to university worth it, and gives me confidence that the decision to explore my horizons was the step in the right direction.”</p>
<p>Vinay chose the IIML because of the intimate class size, the workshop environment and one year course structure.</p>
<p>“The IIML has been warm, gentle and nurturing—it&#39;s a great environment to find one&#39;s feet (or voice) as a writer.”</p>
<p>Set in present day New England, <em>The Bloody Mulligans</em> tells the story of a brother in search of his sister. After an unexpected reprieve for the murder of a police officer, Patrick &#39;Major&#39; Mulligan sets out on a search for his estranged sister Maggie—and discovers that someone else has been living Maggie&#39;s life for several years.</p>
<p>Ken Duncum, the IIML’s Michael Hirschfeld Director of Scriptwriting, says that Vinay showed huge commitment—and faith—in coming to New Zealand to do his MA in Scriptwriting.</p>

<p>“Inventive, passionate and heartfelt, <em>The Bloody Mulligans</em> is a story of redemption in a world of shades of grey. Subtle and revealing levels of complexity, it is a rich and rewarding story—testament to the excellence of Vinay’s craft and art as a filmwriter.”</p>
<p>Funded through the Victoria University Foundation, the David Carson-Parker Embassy Prize in Scriptwriting was established through an endowment by the Embassy Theatre Trust and by arts philanthropist the late David Carson-Parker, and now by Jeremy Commons.</p>
