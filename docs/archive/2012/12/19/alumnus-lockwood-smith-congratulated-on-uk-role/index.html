<p><strong>Wednesday, December 19, 2012</strong><br><strong>Alumnus Lockwood Smith congratulated on UK role</strong></p>
<p>Massey University vice-chancellor Steve Maharey has congratulated distinguished alumnus Dr Lockwood Smith on his appointment as New Zealand High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, following a distinguished career as a Member of Parliament.</p>
<p>Dr Smith, who gained his Bachelor of Agricultural Science (1970), Master of Agricultural Science (1973) and lectured at Massey before completing a PhD in animal science at the University of Adelaide, will leave Parliament to take up the new role early next year after four years as Speaker and 28 years as an MP.</p>
<p>Mr Maharey says Dr Smith has retained strong connections and many friendships with Massey staff and alumni throughout his career. He and current Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Robert Anderson are close friends, who studied at the same time and were young lecturers together.</p>
<p>In 2010 Dr Smith was a recipient of one of the inaugural Massey Distinguished Alumni Awards, presented for meritorious service to the university, community or nation, Mr Maharey says. &quot;In Lockwood&#39;s case, the award was richly deserved on all counts. He has done Massey proud and I am sure will continue to do New Zealand proud.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Anderson says Dr Smith was an &quot;outstanding&quot; student in agricultural science. &quot;He played a full part in all aspects of university life as a student and as a staff member. I believe he will be ideally suited to the role of high commissioner because of his knowledge of New Zealand and passion for its future.&quot;</p>
