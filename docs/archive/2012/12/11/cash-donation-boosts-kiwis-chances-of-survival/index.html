<p><strong>Cash Donation Boosts Kiwis’ Chances Of Survival</strong></p>
<p>A generous donation to research being undertaken at Lincoln University’s Centre for Wildlife Management and Conservation will help fast-track a predator-control project that will aid the survival of thousands of kiwi chicks and benefit a wide range of other native species.</p>
<p>Ninety-five per cent of kiwi chicks die in the wild each year, with half the losses attributed to stoat predation. In 2011 alone, it was estimated 10,000 kiwi chicks were killed by stoats. Thanks to a donation by the Gary Chisholm Family Trust, field-testing of a new stoat control device, the Spitfire, can progress ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Dr Des Smith, who will lead the field trial, says, “Controlling stoats to protect kiwi and other native birds isn’t new of course but traditional traps are labour-intensive - they kill once and then have to be re-set. The Spitfire resets itself, targeting a large number of stoats before it needs to be serviced. As a result it has the potential to significantly reduce the number of kiwi chicks lost each year in a much more cost-effective way than traditional trapping.”</p>
<p>Conservation is very important to Gary Chisholm, spokesperson for the family Trust, who, on making the donation, said “The family trust is making the donation to the research at Lincoln because it will directly result in greater native bird survival in the mountains. The sound of New Zealand’s native birds is something I want more people to experience – it’s an amazing tie to our country, and it is why we are supporting the Centre’s work with the Spitfire field trials.”</p>

<p>The Gary Chisholm Family Trust has donated money to several conservation causes including the Pomona Island Charitable Trust for trapping pests on Pomona and Rona Islands so native birds can flourish and be enjoyed. “As a Trust we are very pleased to support Des and the team’s work because by expanding our conservation support into the research of new tools, we can help speed up even more efficient and effective pest control and therefore save more native birds. I very much hope that other individuals or corporations will join us in supporting this very valuable research.”</p>
<p>The Spitfire works by firing a paste containing the toxin PAPP (para-aminopropiophenone) onto the stoat as it passes through a tunnel. The device then re-sets. When the stoat later grooms the paste from its fur, it ingests the toxin. PAPP was registered for use in 2011, following research at the Centre of Wildlife Management and Conservation, in conjunction with the Department of Conservation and Connovation Ltd.</p>
<p>“The combination of the Spitfire and PAPP means we can be more effective in the control of stoats – and therefore more effective in the conservation of the kiwi, takahe and other native species&quot; says Dr Smith. “The support from the Gary Chisholm Family Trust will amount to around 25% of the field trial costs – a major contribution, enabling us to move faster through the trials. It is great to get this level of support and we are very grateful to the Trust.”</p>
<p>Field trials of the Spitfire will take place in the Blue Mountains, Otago, from March 2013. The Blue Mountains trial will be the first of two field trials needed for registration, and follows extensive lab trials.</p>
<p>The Spitfire is being developed as part of a larger programme entitled &#39;Pest Control for the 21st Century&#39;, funded by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Programme Manager Dr Elaine Murphy says &quot;Self-resetting devices like these will become an increasingly important part of pest control in New Zealand. We are also developing versions of the Spitfire that will target rats, ferrets, and feral cats. These use the same basic mechanism, but in different housings and with a range of different toxins.&quot;</p>
