<p>Hekia must stop running roughshod over the law</p>
<p>The High Court ruling that Hekia Parata acted unlawfully in closing Salisbury residential school is a warning shot for a minister who is running roughshod over due process in Canterbury as well, says Labour’s Associate Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins.</p>
<p>“The High Court ruling today on Salisbury is a victory for the parents’ persistence, common sense and proper process. It’s also a slap in the face for a Minister of the Crown to have their actions ruled unlawful.</p>
<p>“This must be the end of Hekia’s attempts to close Salisbury.</p>
<p>“But I predict it won’t be the end of these sorts of hearings for Hekia. She is making a habit of riding roughshod over communities’ concerns and that annoying thing called the law.</p>
<p>“In the Salisbury case Hekia announced what she was going do, conducted a dubious consultation and then went ahead with her original plan. That’s worryingly similar with what’s going on in Canterbury.</p>
<p>“The High Court ruling is a serious warning for Hekia. It’s time she followed the letter of the law and respected the views of communities. Otherwise she’s in for more run-ins with the High Court.”</p>
