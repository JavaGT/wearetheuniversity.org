<p><strong>Pioneering Nelson architect follows her heart</strong></p>
<p>Nelson architect Min Hall was Victoria University’s first female Architecture graduate in 1979—and this week, she graduates again, this time with a Master of Architecture with Merit.</p>
<p>Min says her fascination with architecture started early. “When my father brought home <em>The First New Zealand Whole Earth Catalogue</em> in 1972, I was in my fifth form year and trying to decide which career path to follow—meteorology or architecture. The book sealed it; architecture it was.”</p>
<p>Min was intrigued by do-it-yourself ideas about creating shelter, using local materials and the revival of vernacular traditions in general.</p>
<p>After graduating she set up an architectural practice near Nelson, and actively pursued projects involving alternative building systems, designing ten earth buildings and three using straw bale. However it became economically unviable for her practice to take on these projects, which generally required more time and had smaller budgets—so she decided to take time out from practice to return to education, and research how existing earth and straw buildings were performing.</p>
<p>Her Master’s thesis, which she completed at Victoria this year, investigates whether buildings made of earth and straw bale have a place in the contemporary world.</p>
<p>“Buildings have been made with earth for thousands of years, right across the globe, and some of New Zealand’s oldest buildings—such as Pompallier House in Russell, which was built in 1842—are made from earth. In Nelson and Tasman 150 earth and/or straw bale houses have been built since 1948.”</p>

<p>The idea of using bales of straw as building blocks to construct dwellings was first realised in the timber-poor state of Nebraska, at the end of the 19th century when baling machines were invented. One hundred years later it was introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Straw bale houses can perform incredibly well,” says Min. “Since 1996, 32 houses have been constructed of straw in the Nelson/Tasman region alone, and my research shows that there is huge potential for this method to be used more in New Zealand.”</p>
<p>Min is graduating in a ceremony to be held on Thursday 13 December.</p>
