<p>Faith Jeremiah  </p>
<p>A University of Canterbury (UC) student who never went to school until she was 16 has defied the odds to earn a Bachelor of Commerce degree with first class honours.</p>
<p>Faith Jeremiah will graduate tomorrow at the top of her management class at UC and she says she has created a better future for herself and her family as a result.</p>
<p>The second oldest of 13 children, Jeremiah says she was brought up in a cultish atmosphere and was very isolated. She never attended schools, doctors, church and was separated from all extended family, the general public and all forms of media.</p>
<p>``I ran away from home at 15. With little life experience, I became pregnant at 16 and decided an education was urgently needed to enable me to change my son’s future.</p>
<p>``I attended Karanga Mai, Kaiapoi High School&#39;s centre for young parents, and worked very hard starting with primary level education to finally obtaining NZCA Level 1 and 2 and in doing so won the Clayton Cosgrove Cup of Excellence from the school.</p>
<p>``I enrolled at UC after six years of schooling, finding it initially challenging and scary with still an immense amount of catching up to do socially and academically. My grades progressed from C to A+ as I gained confidence and experience.</p>

<p>``Being a mum with two young children, I worked extremely hard to obtain first class honours in order to launch straight into my PhD next year. I chose franchising as my topic, not only because of my immense interest in it, but also because it opens up wide future prospects to start my own franchise business. I also hope to initiate a franchising tertiary institution in New Zealand, similar to Griffith University in Australia. My partner has been a tremendous support through this journey.</p>
<p>``Franchise start-up has long been claimed to be the most important stage of the franchise life cycle to the success and longevity of franchises, despite little known research exploring this stage. The fact that New Zealand currently has the most franchises per capita worldwide and is one of the most rapidly developing business models in New Zealand, highlight the significance of my proposed PhD study which seeks to examine in depth the relationship between the start-up stage and business longevity.</p>
<p>``I have found tremendous support from UC staff. I enjoy the positive learning environment and studying under staff who are dedicated to encourage, lead and challenge students to reach their goals. UC is a well-recognised university internationally and my Bachelor of Commerce degree will hold me in good stead anywhere around the world.’’</p>
<p>Jeremiah has been a student mentor and during her studies worked as a research assistant. Her supervising lecturer Associate Professor Colleen Mills said Jeremiah’s story was an inspiration to all those who aspire to improve their lives through education.</p>
<p>``Hers is a ‘where there is a will that is a way’ story. She has steadfastly worked to gain an education in spite of challenges that many would see as barriers and has achieved great results. She thoroughly deserves our congratulations. She is an exception young woman whose positive attitude and tenacity will take her far,’’ Associate Professor Mills said.</p>
<p>A total of 4500 UC students will graduate this week. Former All Blacks rugby coach Sir Graham Henry and New Zealand’s first chief coroner Judge Neil MacLean will receive Honorary Doctorates.<br>ends</p>
