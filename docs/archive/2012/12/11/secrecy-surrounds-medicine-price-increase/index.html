<p><strong>Tuesday, 11 December 2012, 1:04 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Barbara Stewart MP</strong><br>Spokesperson for Health<br>11 December 2012</p>
<p><strong>Secrecy Surrounds Medicine Price Increase</strong></p>
<p>The Government has been accused of bringing in new increased prescription charges by stealth.</p>
<p>New Zealand First health spokesperson Barbara Stewart says even pharmacists have not yet been officially advised of the prescription increase from $3 to $5 an item on New Year’s Day.</p>
<p>“Pharmacists who have contacted the Ministry of Health have been told that Minister Tony Ryall does not want any posters prepared advising the public of the increased charge.”</p>
<p>Mrs Stewart says it is obvious the Minister is aiming to shift the blame for the increased price from the Government to the pharmacies during the holiday period.</p>
<p>“This is the sort of stunt that has become typical of this Government. They inflict increasing damage on ordinary people and then try to blame someone else.</p>
<p>“When hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders pay extra for their prescribed medicine from January 1 they should realise that it’s only the start of the misery the Government will inflict on them in 2013,” says Mrs Stewart.  </p>
