<p>Victoria graduands end the year on a high note</p>
<p>More than 1,000 students will begin their festive season celebrations this week by marking the successful completion of their studies at Victoria University during the December Graduation ceremonies and parade.</p>
<p>A total of 1,166 qualifications will be awarded, including 57 PhDs, to graduands from Victoria Business School, and the faculties of Architecture and Design; Education; Engineering; Humanities and Social Sciences, Law; Science; Toihuarewa and Te Kōkī—New Zealand School of Music.</p>
<p>Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says getting a degree represents an outstanding achievement that should be celebrated.</p>
<p>“Graduation time is a celebration of excellence. Our graduands have worked hard to attain their qualifications and Victoria, along with their family and friends, is proud of their achievements.”</p>
<p>He says Victoria graduates go on to make a valuable contribution to New Zealand’s economy and society.</p>
<p>“Our students graduate with a diverse range of skills and attributes, imbued with a global perspective that is vital for today’s workforce.</p>
<p>“I encourage graduands preparing to forge their futures in their chosen careers to take inspiration from this Graduation’s honorary doctorate recipient, Peter Haythornthwaite. Peter Haythornthwaite is an industrial designer whose extensive creative output has garnered national and international recognition.</p>
