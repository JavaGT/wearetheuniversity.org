<p><strong>Teachers’ anger on Christchurch schools justified</strong></p>
<p>Hekia Parata’s plan for the future of Canterbury’s schools has been bungled from day one, and teachers’ anger at the Government is completely justified, says Megan Woods.</p>
<p>The Wigram MP today tabled the NZEI petition signed by more than 11,000 teachers calling on John Key to bring a halt to “the Government&#39;s flawed plan for the future of education in Christchurch.” It also urges the Government to “stop and listen to the region&#39;s students, parents and educators about what is best for children and their learning.”</p>
<p>“The message from teachers is loud and clear – the Government has stuffed-up and if it wants to fix things, it needs to start by listening.</p>
<p>“From the outset, this plan has been imposed on Christchurch by the Beehive. It is unbelievable that such major changes were proposed without seeking proper input from the people it would affect most; teachers, students and parents.</p>
<p>“Well, Christchurch teachers have had enough. They are angry at the arrogance and casual disregard for the views of the community that Hekia Parata and National have displayed.</p>
<p>“The Government is forcing Christchurch schools down a path that not only harms the fantastic education system we have in the city, but ignores a raft of positive ideas put forward as worthy alternatives.</p>
<p>“This petition should be a wake-up call for John Key and his Ministers. They need to swallow their pride and start working with teachers, principals and parents to find a positive way forward.</p>
<p>“The future of education in Christchurch is too important to get wrong. It is not too late for the Government to start listening to the people of Christchurch,” says Megan Woods.</p>
