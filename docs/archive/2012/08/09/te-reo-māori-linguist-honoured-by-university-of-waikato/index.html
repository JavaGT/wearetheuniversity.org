<p>Te Reo Māori linguist honoured by University of Waikato</p>
<p>A key contributor to the linguistic study of Te Reo Māori has been honoured by the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>Dr Ray Harlow, who helped establish linguistics as a subject area during his 20-year career at Waikato, received an honorary fellowship at a ceremony at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts earlier this week.</p>
<p>He and his wife Ann were welcomed to the ceremony with a karanga, and Dr Harlow was able to respond to the opening comments by his University colleague Tom Roa in fluent Te Reo.</p>
<p>Pro-Chancellor Dr Brian Linehan bestowed the award, noting that Dr Harlow had enhanced the mana of the University through his outstanding service in the field of linguistics.</p>
<p>Dr Harlow said it was a great honour to receive an honorary fellowship. “It’s been a really great privilege to have been able to spend my entire working life mucking around with languages.”</p>
<p>Languages, he said, are valuable for the access they grant to other cultures and peoples, and to a much wider world.</p>
<p>Dr Harlow began his academic career as a classicist before turning to linguistics. He developed a specialism in Polynesian languages, and was instrumental in establishing the University of Waikato as a centre of study in Te Reo Māori.</p>
<p>He was a founding member of the Māori Language Commission, and is the author of a number of Māori language reference works.</p>
<p>Dr Harlow also worked closely with Māori colleagues at the University of Waikato to set up Te Kōhanga Reo O Ngā Kuaka, adjacent to the University, which celebrates its 25th anniversary next year.</p>
