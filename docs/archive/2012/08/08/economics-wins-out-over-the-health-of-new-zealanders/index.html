<p><strong>Economics Wins Out Over the Health of New Zealanders</strong></p>
<p>The news that hundreds of thousands of diabetics will be forced to rely on cheap, untrusted and unknown testing meters from South Korea will have a dire effect on the elderly, warns New Zealand First.</p>
<p>Health spokesperson Barbara Stewart says the Government and Pharmac care more about money than they do about people.</p>
<p>“We&#39;ve spoken with doctors, health professionals and diabetics and they all say that this is purely an economic exercise aimed at saving a few dollars rather than doing what is best for those New Zealanders suffering from diabetes.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Stewart warns the move is going to disproportionally effect the elderly as they generally struggle with changes in technology and may now forgo testing their blood-sugar levels, which may lead to further complications.</p>
<p>&quot;We are also concerned that a lot of the people affected by this change don’t have ready access to the internet where these changes have been announced.</p>
<p>“We can’t afford to treat our vulnerable like lab rats by subjecting them to a brand that has no public confidence.</p>
<p>“If the Government was serious about tackling the serious issue of diabetes, it would help diabetics rather than make life more difficult for them,” says Mrs Stewart.</p>
