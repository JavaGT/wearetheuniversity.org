<p><strong>Otago Students $780,000 ahead of 2011</strong></p>
<p>The Otago University Students’ Association is pleased with Student Job Search’s latest figures released yesterday showing Otago students had so far earned $785,000 more than in 2011 from placements through the agency.</p>
<p>“The SJS service is provided by OUSA along with student associations around the country, and these figures show why it ranks as one of the most popular services we provide,” said Logan Edgar, OUSA President, “It’s great to see those students who have the time, the opportunity, or the need to earn more while they’re at Uni getting the chance to do so. And employers tell us they like to see students with some employment experience on their CV.”</p>
<p>The figures showed the 26% increase was joined by other positive increases showing students were working for longer as worker weeks increased by 22%, and earning on average 46% more up to $1744 per placement from $1195. Enrolments also saw a rise; up 36% showing an increase in the number of students looking for work.</p>
<p>“This shows that students placed in work are working more, and there are more students needing work,” said Edgar, “With a total of 7765 active searchers, it’s the gap between those students searching for work and placements that is my concern. It’s a gap that’s likely to increase in the future as Government changes next year to allowances will force more students out to find work.”</p>
<p>OUSA was the first association to temporarily set up SJS kiosks in their offices to support student connection with SJS and employers when the job agency moved its operations online in 2011. The popularity of the kiosks has meant the kiosks are permanent and that the OUSA is now looking at improving them.</p>

<p>“We want to make the kiosks even cooler to make them stand out more,” said Edgar, “so we’re thinking about turning an old arcade machine into an SJS branded kiosk to attract a bit more attention and make the job hunt a bit more fun.”</p>
