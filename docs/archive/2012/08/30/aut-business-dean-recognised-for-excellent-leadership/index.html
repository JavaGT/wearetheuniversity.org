<p><strong>AUT Business Dean recognised for excellent leadership</strong></p>
<p>Dean of AUT Business School Dr Geoff Perry has been selected as a finalist in the Westpac Central Auckland Business Awards 2012.</p>
<p>Out of 111 entries, 24 companies and four individuals were announced across eight categories last night at a special ceremony at the Orams Marine Boatpark, Westhaven. Dr Geoff Perry joins three other individual finalists in the category for ‘Excellence in Business Leadership’, recognised for their innovation, outstanding leadership, and vision.</p>
<p>The prestigious Westpac Business Excellence Awards take place all around the country, in conjunction with local Chambers of Commerce. The awards give businesses the opportunity to benchmark their success against other local businesses outside of their own industries.</p>
<p>Auckland Chamber of Commerce’s Chief Executive Michael Barnett says the awards highlight true excellence in business and lift benchmarks for everyone.</p>
<p>On being selected as a finalist Dean Geoff Perry says it’s rewarding for AUT Business School to be recognised for its collaborative achievements over the past three years.</p>
<p>“AUT Business School is driven by its engagement with industry. We are very committed to curriculum, teaching and research that is relevant to business. As a provider of business education in New Zealand we are preparing the next generation of business professionals and leaders. It’s therefore immensely important that we continue to operate in close collaboration with business and the community, while also demonstrating our own clear vision and leadership.</p>

<p>Category winners of the Westpac Central Business Award will be announced at a gala dinner at the Langham Hotel in Auckland on 2 November.</p>
