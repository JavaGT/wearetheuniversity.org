<p><strong>Chinese language study a ticket to adventure</strong></p>
<p>In just two years, University of Waikato student Sarah Thomson has gone from knowing nothing about China to being selected to represent New Zealand at a Chinese language speech competition.</p>
<p>Sarah was one of 120 international contestants in the finals of the Chinese Bridge Speech Competition, held in Beijing last month. She had to deliver a five-minute speech in Chinese, and then sing a Chinese song.</p>
<p>She and the other contestants also took part in a televised performance with one of China’s most famous TV hosts, Canadian-born Dashan (Mark Rowswell) who speaks fluent Chinese.</p>
<p>“It was good fun,” says Sarah. “I got through to the top 30 in the competition, and we had the chance to do some sightseeing around the Forbidden City as well.”</p>
<p>The former Fairfield College student originally began studying English and Psychology at the University of Waikato in 2009.</p>
<p>“I then heard about the AIESEC exchange programme, and chose to go China even though I knew nothing about it except for noodles and pandas,” she says.</p>
<p>AIESEC is an international student volunteer programme operating in 110 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>“I spent several months teaching English in Beijing, first in a kindergarten and then in a high school, and started to learn some Chinese,” says Sarah. “And when I came back to Waikato, I swapped to a Chinese degree.”</p>
<p>Waikato’s small class sizes and access to a native speaker teacher were a big plus, and she says students are always encouraged to apply for scholarships and enter competitions.</p>

<p>Last year, she won a scholarship to spend six months on an intensive Chinese language course in Beijing, and this year she’s embarked on a conjoint law degree which she’s juggling with the final year of her Chinese degree.</p>
<p>“I’m hoping law will open doors to work as a bridge between China and New Zealand, plus I think it’s a good thing to have in my tool box,” she says.</p>
<p>Sarah is now planning to start up a youth branch of the New Zealand-China Friendship Association in Hamilton.</p>
<p>“China is such an important country for New Zealand, and we need more people who understand the language and culture. So I want to get my fellow students to go into the high schools to encourage more students to take up Chinese.”</p>
