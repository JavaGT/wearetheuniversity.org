<p><strong>Victoria University&#39;s Faculty of Engineering gains full industry accreditation</strong></p>
<p>As New Zealand looks increasingly towards science and engineering to drive business innovation, Victoria University’s Faculty of Engineering has made an important step forward for students in the field.</p>
<p>Victoria University’s four-year Bachelor of Engineering (BE) programme has achieved full accreditation from the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand (IPENZ). The promotion from provisional to full accreditation marks the next stage in the development of Victoria’s engineering programme, which launched in 2007.</p>
<p>Professor John Hine, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering says “Victoria’s BE programme intentionally focuses on modern forms of engineering, specialisations that can respond to today’s and tomorrow’s needs. We teach courses on the digital technology that drives the modern world, from electronics to software, and where there is a high demand for graduates in New Zealand.”</p>
<p>“I am delighted that the quality of our BE programme has been recognised with full accreditation from IPENZ, and that the Faculty received such positive comments.”</p>
<p>The Faculty of Engineering has close links with leading technology firms in the Wellington region, and full accreditation recognises that Victoria’s engineering programme is producing quality graduates to enter the industry.</p>
<p>“Students can be confident that completing their engineering degree at Victoria will provide them with an internationally recognised qualification, and will stand them in excellent stead on their paths to exciting careers as professional engineers,” says Professor Hine.</p>
<p>IPENZ commended several aspects of Victoria’s engineering programme including its facilities and laboratories, the accessibility of staff, the level of pastoral care provided to students, and the confidence and positivity of graduates with respect to the programme.</p>
<p>The accreditation process involved a visit by a panel of engineers who spent several days looking at all aspects of the programme, talking to staff, students, graduates and employers and inspecting facilities.</p>
<p>Staff members in Victoria’s Faculty of Engineering are recognised as having strong research credentials and links to industry, as well as having an excellent rapport with their students. The programme is taught in an environment with around 100 research and academic staff, PhD and Master’s students, with world-leading research driving teaching and providing opportunities for undergraduate students to advance their interests.</p>
<p>The Faculty of Engineering is equipped with state of the art equipment, and new undergraduate project laboratories, situated in both the recently-opened Alan MacDiarmid Building and the newly-renovated Cotton Building.</p>
<p><strong>About IPENZ accreditation</strong><br>IPENZ, the professional body which represents professional engineers from all disciplines in New Zealand, manages the accreditation of all New Zealand professional engineering programmes.</p>
<p>Full accreditation means that Victoria University’s BE programme is taught to the standards set out in the Washington Accord, and that Victoria now stands equal with other professional New Zealand engineering programmes in terms of international recognition.</p>
<p>IPENZ accreditation provides graduates with international recognition through the Washington Accord and is a founding signatory to the agreement. Other jurisdictions currently covered by the Accord are Australia, Canada, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong China, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey, the USA and the UK.</p>
