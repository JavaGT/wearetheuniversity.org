<p><strong>Exploring how social class influences educational outcomes</strong></p>
<p>More can be done to reduce the influence of social background on educational achievement, according to Victoria Professor of Education Rob Strathdee.</p>
<p>Professor Strathdee, Head of the School of Education Policy and Implementation, will discuss the connection between education and the labour market in his inaugural professorial lecture at Victoria University on Tuesday 4 September.</p>
<p>Professor Strathdee explores why New Zealand’s education system has struggled to promote the promised level of social mobility, and how more can be done to reduce the influence of social background on educational achievement.</p>
<p>An expert in educational sociology, Professor Strathdee’s research examines the relationship between social class and educational outcomes, with a particular interest in how the competition for advancement is organised through education.</p>
<p>“I am in no doubt that the whole educational enterprise has become increasingly geared to producing what the labour market requires,” says Professor Strathdee.</p>
<p>Professor Strathdee joined Victoria University in 2004 as Senior Lecturer, and went on to become Head of the School of Education Policy and Implementation in 2008. He was appointed Professor of Education in 2011.</p>
<p>His scholarly expertise has been sought by a number of educational boards and committees and has led to a number of editorial roles for top academic publications. He has also presented a variety of papers at conferences in New Zealand and abroad.</p>

<p>“Inaugural lectures are also an excellent opportunity for the University to celebrate and acknowledge our valued professors,” says Professor Walsh.</p>
