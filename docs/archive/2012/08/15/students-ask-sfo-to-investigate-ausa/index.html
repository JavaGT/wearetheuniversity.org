<p>MEDIA RELEASE -- FOR IMMEDIATE USE<br>10am -- 15.8.12</p>
<p>Students ask SFO to investigate AUSA</p>
<p>This morning three Auckland University students laid a complaint with the Serious Fraud Office concerning transactions made between their student union, the Auckland University Students&#39; Association, and its related entities.</p>
<p>AUSA is an organisation of 16,000 student members.</p>
<p>The students have reason to believe that over $600,000 of related party transactions made by AUSA to a related business was improperly accounted for by that business or duly authorised by the executive of AUSA.</p>
<p>The students also believe the loans have been unlawfully capitalised by the related business in 2011.</p>
<p>The students claim that these transactions bring the solvency of AUSA into question and jeopardise AUSA&#39;s ability to provide services to students. Assets and services at risk include 95bfm radio station, Shadows bar, Craccum magazine, funding for clubs, welfare services, student events and advocacy.</p>
<p>The students urge the SFO to investigate this and any other instances of improper transactions within AUSA and its related entities as a matter of priority and public interest.</p>
