<p><strong>The University of Waikato (New Zealand) Chooses Blue/Evaluations by eXplorance</strong></p>
<p>MONTREAL, CANADA -- (Marketwire) -- Aug 26, 2012 -- The University of Waikato has chosen to leverage Blue/Evaluations in order to furnish a fully integrated online appraisal system.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato decided to increase its requirements for survey data around all aspects of the student experience, including student evaluations. The old paper-based system was deemed slow, inefficient and offered little integration with other university systems. At this point, the university began looking for alternatives. A scoping project was initiated in order to determine what the university required in terms of functionality, but also to find out what systems would be most useful to integrate within the University.</p>
<p>&quot;A number of visits were made to universities in New Zealand and Australia to look at a number of predominantly online systems. During this time a visiting academic from the University of Western Australia told us about Blue by eXplorance. A few calls later, a demonstration of the software was setup and run from the eXplorance offices in Canada. Straightaway we could see the huge potential that this software could have for evaluations at our institution,&quot; states Dr. Trudy Harris, Teacher Developer at Waikato University. &quot;It ticked all of the boxes on our requirements list, but also enabled us to consider some additional functions around professional development of academic staff.&quot;</p>
