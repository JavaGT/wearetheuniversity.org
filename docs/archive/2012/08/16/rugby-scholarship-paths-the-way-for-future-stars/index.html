<p><strong>Rugby Scholarship Paths The Way For Future Stars</strong></p>
<p>A rugby scholarship offered at The University of Auckland is helping to path the way for talented secondary school rugby players.</p>
<p>The John Drake Memorial Scholarship is a scholarship offered by the University and the Auckland University Rugby Club, celebrating the life of former All Black and notable media personality John Drake, an alumnus of the University and the rugby club.</p>
<p>Robert Taylor, Director of Rugby at the University Rugby Club, says the aim is to help outstanding individuals continue to excel both on and off the field. “The aim of the scholarship is always to assist those who, like John, have a dedication to their sport and to their studies and help create a well-rounded individual.</p>
<p>“John created his own legend with an exceptional rugby career and a distinguished service as a rugby media personality. The three recipients so far are all very well-mannered balanced people who have fulfilled all the key qualities that this scholarship stands for.”</p>
<p>2012 recipient former Westlake Boys College student Sam Viscovich has put in a strong performance for the club’s U21 side as well as performing well academically, receiving straight As in the first semester of his Commerce and Arts conjoint degree.</p>
<p>The 2010 and 2011 recipients, both former students of Mt Albert Grammar School, have had notable rugby careers to date with both named in representative teams. Sean Brookman, an arts student, was named in the 2011 New Zealand Under 20s development squad while Matt Matich, an engineering student, was named in this year’s Auckland Juniors team.</p>
