<p>Study on weta wins UC’s thesis-in three-minutes award</p>
<p>August 23, 2012</p>
<p>A student studying the hybridisation of tree weta on Banks Peninsula has picked up $5000 for winning University of Canterbury’s third annual thesis in three minutes prize.</p>
<p>Fifteen students who reached the final were each given just three minutes to explain the what, why and how of their thesis.</p>
<p>Rachel Walsh who is looking into legal regulation of organ transplantation was second and Balaji Somasundaram was third with a presentation on the influenza war.</p>
<p>Funding was provided by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor’s Office.</p>
<p>Organiser of the event Professor Lucy Johnston said all the presentations were outstanding which made a difficult job for the judges.</p>
