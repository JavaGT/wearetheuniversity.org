<p><strong>Government Invests In Tools For Better Broadband Performance</strong></p>
<p>The University of Waikato’s WAND Network Research Group has been awarded just under $1.5 million in government funding over four years to develop models and tools to monitor the performance of internet networks across New Zealand.</p>
<p>It’s one of two University of Waikato projects to win funding in the first tranche of results of the 2012 Ministry of Business, Innovation &amp; Employment research funding round, announced today.</p>
<p>The other successful Waikato project is a two-year investigation into positive ageing in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The network infrastructure monitoring project is led by Dr Richard Nelson, and will involve the first-ever comprehensive measurement of the performance and topology of the network infrastructure across the whole country.</p>
<p>“The internet is fast becoming a key infrastructure, and the government is now investing $1.5 billion in ultra-fast broadband and the rural broadband initiative,” says Dr Nelson.</p>
<p>“But the internet is only as good as its weakest point – and that’s where we come in. We’re aiming to build a distributed platform to monitor the links between all the different networks, which will allow network operators to detect problems in service without having to wait for users to alert them.”</p>
<p>He says it’s important to note the researchers are only interested in the performance of the physical network.</p>
<p>“We won’t be looking at the information carried on the networks, so there are no issues with privacy or commercial confidentiality. Our aim is simply to make sure the information gets through.”</p>

<p>Dr Nelson and his colleague Professor Tony McGregor aim to use the technology developed through the project to build better tools for service providers to use themselves for end-to-end monitoring of their networks.</p>
<p>Dr Nelson says it’s envisaged the monitoring platform will be able to automatically identify and locate network problems which will help improve the resilience of New Zealand’s digital infrastructure.</p>
<p>“The lessons learned from the Christchurch earthquake point up the vulnerability of our infrastructure lifelines to natural hazards. If we can easily pinpoint the source of a problem, then it’s that much quicker to fix it.”</p>
<p>The WAND Network Research Group is based in the University of Waikato’s Department of Computer Science, and has a particular specialisation in network measurement, modelling and simulation. It has a strong record in contract research and consulting in the telecommunications and computer networks field.</p>
