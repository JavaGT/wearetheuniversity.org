<p>Media Release<br>1 August 2012<br><em>- for immediate release</em></p>
<p><strong>Meritorious Voluntary Service Medal Awarded</strong></p>
<p>South Canterbury farmer Alvin Reid has been awarded a Lincoln University Medal for long and meritorious voluntary service to the University.</p>
<p>Mr Reid, who farms at Winchester, helped develop the Lincoln University-based South Island Dairying Development Centre (SIDDC) and the Lincoln University Dairy Farm, and he has provided strong on-going support for both enterprises.</p>
<p>He was a founding member of the SIDDC Board and played a major role in the establishment of the Lincoln University Dairy Farm in 2000 – 2001 and served on its Business Advisory Group.</p>
<p>In recent times he has been a member and leader of the review of the University’s dairy farm and the development of its new ‘Precision Dairying’ focus.</p>
<p>His citation for the medal notes that the creation of SIDDC and development of the Lincoln University Dairy Farm have been two ‘substantial initiatives’ enhancing Lincoln University’s engagement with the South Island dairying industry.</p>
<p>Mr Reid is a past winner of the Lincoln University Foundation South Island Farmer of the Year Award. His service to the dairy industry has also included contributions as a director of Livestock Improvement Corporation and Dexcel Ltd, now DairyNZ.</p>
<p>The Lincoln University Medal, awarded by the University Council, was instituted in 2008 and it acknowledges meritorious service by staff members, alumni, or community members, who have made long and outstanding contributions supporting the ‘fabric and reputation’ of the University.</p>
<p>Two further awards of the medal will be made this year - to Ashburton-based farm consultant and rural valuer Robert (Bob) Engelbrecht, and to farm consultant, valuer and farmer John Ryan who has a property between Lincoln and Tai Tapu.</p>
