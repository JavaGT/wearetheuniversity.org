<p><strong>Environmental Research Institute signs Biodiversity Accord</strong></p>
<p>The University of Waikato’s Environmental Research Institute (ERI) joined 19 of New Zealand’s environmental leaders in New Plymouth last week to sign an historic accord.</p>
<p>The Taranaki Biodiversity Forum Accord is a regional response to protecting native plants, animals and habitats.</p>
<p>“The accord presents a great opportunity for the ERI to work with like-minded groups to deliver better biodiversity outcomes for the region,” says Environmental Research Institute Director, and Dean of the University of Waikato’s Faculty of Science &amp; Engineering, Professor Bruce Clarkson.</p>
<p>The signing was witnessed by Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson who said she would be heralding the initiative to other groups around the country.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an Accord that&#39;s by, for and between the people who are doing the work on the ground to protect and enhance indigenous biodiversity in the region,&quot; says the Taranaki Regional Council Chairman, David MacLeod.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a tremendous achievement for Taranaki and will lead to greater enhancement and protection of the region&#39;s native flora and fauna.&quot;</p>
<p>Signatories included the Department of Conservation, Forest and Bird, Tiaki Te Mauri O Parininihi Trust, Ngā Motu Marine Reserve Society, the Taranaki Kiwi Trust, and regional and district councils. Waikato University’s Environmental Research Institute was the only research provider to sign the accord.</p>
<p>Professor Bruce Clarkson was accompanied at the signing by ERI staff and former Waikato University students, Catherine Bryan, Toni Cornes and Jackson Efford.</p>
