<p>CTU Media Release</p>
<p>1 August 2012</p>
<p><strong>Industry Training Review Must Include Worker Perspectives</strong></p>
<p>The speech by Minister Steven Joyce at the Industry Training Federation Conference today was made in the context of a huge need to develop and retain skilled workers in New Zealand rather than see the continual loss of such workers to Australia and elsewhere, said Peter Conway, Council of Trade Unions Secretary.</p>
<p>Peter Conway says &quot;the possibility that many workers in the Canterbury rebuild are migrants is also a major concern. The need to lift wages and productivity in New Zealand is also closely connected to the scale and performance of our vocational education system.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is important that the views of workers including current apprentices are included in the review. The CTU has made extensive submissions as part of the review.&quot;</p>
<p>Peter Conway says &quot;we do not think the basic features of the industry training system are at fault. That means we support a national qualifications framework with a high level of portability. We also support the roles played by Industry Training Organisations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the changes announced today such as greater coordination of on-job and off-job training, and more support for apprentices sound positive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The comments the Minister has made on sustainable funding need to be clarified with a lot more detail. While they sound positive this Government has taken significant levels of funding out of industry training in the last few years.”</p>
<p>“The Minister has stated that industry itself should take over the strategic leadership role on skills from ITOs. It is important that &#39;industry&#39; is not seen as employers alone and includes union views and contributions,&quot; said Peter Conway.</p>
