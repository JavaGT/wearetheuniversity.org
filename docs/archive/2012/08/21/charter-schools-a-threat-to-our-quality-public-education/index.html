<p><strong>Tuesday, 21 August 2012, 11:47 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZEI">NZEI</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>PRESS STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Public meeting</strong>: <strong>What’s happening to our kids’ education?</strong> <strong>Charter schools a threat to public education</strong> (see below for speakers, including Martin Thrupp Professor of Education Waikato University).</p>
<p>This is part of a series of meetings being organised by NZEI. These meetings are intended to inform and encourage our communities to actively protect New Zealand’s high quality local schools, as reflected in OECD rankings for maths and literacy .</p>
<p>The combination of Govt policies from cuts to early childhood and tertiary, charter schools, unqualified teachers, national standards, performance pay, league tables and private public partnerships are part of a free market agenda to privatise education. We intend to build opposition to protect our successful public education system.</p>
<p>Overseas these policies have created barriers to students’ learning, particularly for the lowest twenty persent of students who the Government claims they will help. Why would we want public taxpayers money skimmed off for private profit when schools are already under funded?</p>
