<p>Media Release<br>22 August 2012<br><em>- for immediate release</em></p>
<p><strong>Premier Netball Team Win Final For The Second Year Running</strong></p>
<p>Lincoln University’s premier netball team has won the 2012 Christchurch Netball Centre Premier Championship on Tuesday 21 August 2012, beating St Nicholas 53-41, for the second year running.</p>
<p>“To win the championship two years running is an exceptional achievement and even more so to have lost only a single game in that time. Our players put their hearts and souls into the game last night and I congratulate them, the coach and the support team for a superb effort” says Lincoln University Vice-Chancellor Dr Andrew West.</p>
<p>For Bev Gordon, it has been a rewarding season as first year as coach. “I couldn’t be any happier with the success of the team this year. We went into this season with a new coach, seven new players and with the knowledge that the 2011 netball team ended the season unbeaten. It was a hard-fought final, particularly the final quarter, and I thank St Nicholas for their sportsmanship.</p>
<p>“My thanks have to go to the players, the support team and Lincoln University staff and facilities for their ongoing commitment. It’s been an incredible season and one we will celebrate fittingly” she says.</p>
<p>The netball winning hopefully will not stop with the premier netball team. On Saturday 25 August the Lincoln University B team will play Villa Maria in the Senior 2 grade final and in a semi-final match, the Lincoln University Selwyn social team will be on court playing for a spot in the final.</p>
<p>The Lincoln University Netball Club is an open netball club that commenced in 2000 with one team playing in Christchurch. The club has grown over the years and in 2012 had seven teams, six in Christchurch and one in Selwyn, playing competitive and social netball. The Premier Netball team have won the championship three times in the past four years.  </p>
