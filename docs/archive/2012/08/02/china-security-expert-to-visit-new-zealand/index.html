<p><strong>China security expert to visit New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>One of the world’s leading authorities on China’s foreign policy and North Asian security issues will be based at Victoria University until early September.</p>
<p>Professor Zhu Feng, from Peking University in Beijing, holds the Sir Howard Kippenberger Visiting Chair for 2012. His expertise will help Victoria’s Centre for Strategic Studies research security issues in the Asia Pacific region and their impact on New Zealand.</p>
<p>“China’s growing power and America’s response are shifting the strategic landscape and Professor Zhu will provide a dynamic perspective on where these tides are headed,” says Professor Robert Ayson, Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies.</p>
<p>“I’m delighted that Professor Zhu has accepted this appointment as he is one of the most interesting speakers one can possibly find on how China sees the world. His analysis will make a significant contribution to New Zealand’s understanding of strategic affairs in North Asia, a part of the Asia-Pacific region which is shaping the world’s economic and security destiny.”</p>
<p>The public will get an opportunity to hear insights from Professor Zhu, who is regarded as an authority on China’s foreign policy and its relationship with the United States. He will deliver the annual Kippenberger Lecture at Victoria University on 3 September on the topic: ‘<em>China&#39;s Response to America&#39;s Asia-Pacific Rebalancing: Implications for Regional Order</em>’.</p>
<p>The lecture will examine interaction between China and the United States and whether they are headed towards greater strategic competition or a future where they build on common interests to protect regional prosperity and security.</p>
