<p><strong>Waikato takes the campus to the city with new finance course for professionals</strong></p>
<p><strong>In a move to ‘meet the market’, the Finance Department at The University of Waikato Management School is offering a graduate qualification in finance for city-based professionals, managers and executives at a convenient inner-city location.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to an agreement with Hamilton law firm Tompkins Wake, the course will be held in the firm’s boardroom on the top floor of Westpac House on Victoria Street on Tuesday evenings, with further tutorials offered online. The course is designed to enable participants to complete a Graduate Diploma in 12 months, or a Graduate Certificate in only six months</p>
<p>Associate Professor Stuart Locke, who chairs the Finance Department in the management school, is running the course and says it is a chance for the University to engage with its city. “We are excited to be able to offer something quite unique. We know many city-based executives and professionals are extremely busy, but they also value continuing education and professional development. Here is an opportunity to gain a world-class, university qualification in finance without leaving the city, or taking time off work.”</p>
<p>Dr Locke says that in many cases lawyers and accountants need more knowledge about finance issues and the pressure on professionals, Trustees and Directors to understand finance is only going to increase. “Finance is a way of thinking about things. This programme helps people understand finance in a way that they can apply it to their profession and personal lives.”</p>
<p>Classes started on 31 July, but there is still time for those thinking about further study to enroll.
