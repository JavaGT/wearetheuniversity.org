<p>17 August 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>Basin Reserve flyover decision deeply flawed</p>
<p>The decision by the New Zealand Transport Agency to back a flyover beside the Basin Reserve is deeply flawed and continues the Government’s piecemeal approach to transport issues in Wellington city, Grant Robertson MP for Wellington Central and Annette King MP for Rongotai said today.</p>
<p>“The construction of a large concrete flyover beside the Basin Reserve is the wrong approach to dealing with transport issues in the area. There are alternatives that need to be revisited that will improve traffic flow without destroying the character of the area. Sadly, NZTA have failed to listen to the concerns of Wellingtonians and have ploughed on with a flawed proposal.”</p>
<p>“It’s clear that NZTA have not properly considered the impact of the decision to create a Memorial Park in Buckle St. The flyover makes even less sense with the ‘cut and cover’ solution there. The diversion of traffic underground removes the traffic lights at Tasman/Tory St which will significantly change traffic flows. The flyover decision needs to be reconsidered in light of the Government’s unexpected U-turn on the Memorial Park.”</p>
<p>“The Government’s approach to transport in Wellington is piecemeal. The plans released today do not even include a second tunnel through Mt Victoria, which while apparently still on the agenda is so far off it is not even worth putting in this plan. This makes the proposal half-baked and it could actually lead to more traffic congestion.”</p>

<p>“It’s important to remember that the flyover proposal is subject to a separate decision making process from the Memorial Park. We urge NZTA to take a step back and look seriously at the alternative proposals for the Basin Reserve that will fit better with the Park, the amenity value of the Basin Reserve and the desire of Wellingtonians to have a long term, integrated sustainable solution to transport in the city,” Grant Robertson and Annette King said.</p>
