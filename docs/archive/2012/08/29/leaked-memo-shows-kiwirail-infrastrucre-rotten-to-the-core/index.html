<p><strong>Wednesday, 29 August 2012, 2:39 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Brendan Horan MP</strong><br>Spokesperson for Transport<br>29 August 2012</p>
<p><strong>Leaked Memo Shows Kiwirail Infrastrucre Rotten to the Core</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First has obtained a leaked KiwiRail document which paints a bleak picture of our national railway infrastructure which is rotting from the ground up.</p>
<p>Transport spokesperson Brendan Horan says Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee has tried to gloss over serious maintenance issues affecting the safety of our rail network.</p>
<p>“This leaked document shows an inappropriate response to replacing thousands of Peruvian wooden sleepers which were imported with fungi that caused them to rot.</p>
<p>“Instead of replacing them with solid hardwood sleepers, KiwiRail has used the dodgy Peruvian variety so long as they are deemed ‘visually sound’. That sounds like a recipe for disaster.”</p>
<p>Mr Horan says the Minister should reveal the true extent of our railway’s infrastructure crisis which hasn’t been addressed in the Government’s KiwiRail Turnaround Plan.</p>
<p>“Our rail network is falling apart and creating all manner of dangers. Mr Brownlee must acknowledge that and agree to scrap this ridiculous and ineffective Turnaround Plan.</p>
<p>“The Government today announced an increase in taxes to pay for its $12 billion road upgrade programme while it sits by watching our rail network fall apart. It is shameful,” says Mr Horan.</p>
