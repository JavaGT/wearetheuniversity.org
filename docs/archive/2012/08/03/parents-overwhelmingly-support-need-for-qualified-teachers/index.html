<p>Immediate Release</p>
<p>Parents overwhelmingly support the need for qualified teachers – survey result</p>
<p>A survey of New Zealanders shows that the overwhelming majority believe that charter schools should not be allowed to hire unqualified teachers.</p>
<p>The UMR Research Ltd survey of 1000 New Zealanders with an oversample of 300 parents of primary and intermediate school children has also found that a significant majority believe that there is a real risk that private companies running charter schools will put profit ahead of children’s education.</p>
<p>The survey was commissioned by NZEI Te Riu Roa and carried out between 20-31 July with a margin of error of 3.1 % (parent oversample margin of error 5.7%).</p>
<p>It found that 86 % believed that “just like state schools, charter schools should only be allowed to hire teachers who are properly qualified.” And of that 86 %, 72 % felt very strongly.</p>
<p>The survey found that 60% of New Zealanders strongly agreed that “if private companies are allowed to set up charter schools there is a real risk that they will put making a profit ahead of children’s education.”</p>
<p>NZEI National President Ian Leckie says moves by the Government to allow unqualified teachers and principals run charter schools shows it is putting wrong-headed ideology ahead of quality education.</p>
<p>“Following its backdown over plans to increase class sizes, the Government is once again attempting to ride roughshod over public opinion.”</p>

<p>He says exposing New Zealand children to unqualified and unregistered teachers shows that the Government is prepared to take a huge risk with children’s education - a risk that it is willing to undertake in order to continue its assault on professional teaching.”</p>
<p>“Exposing children to unqualified and unregistered teachers will not raise student achievement It will do the opposite.”</p>
<p>The Government needs to listen to New Zealanders, and particularly to parents, who are saying unequivocally that they want quality education for children in this country and they want our teachers to be qualified.</p>
<p>“Our children should not be used as guinea-pigs in dangerous experiments led by ideology simply to uphold the Act party’s support for the National-led Government.”</p>

<p>If private companies are allowed to set up charter schools there is a real risk that they will put making a profit ahead of children’s education Agree 60%, Disagree 14%, 26% unsure.</p>
