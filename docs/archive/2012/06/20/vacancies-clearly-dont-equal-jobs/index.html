<p><strong>Wednesday, 20 June 2012, 5:19 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Su’a William<br>SIO<br>Employment Spokesperson  </p>
<p>20 June 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Vacancies clearly don’t equal jobs</strong></p>
<p>Labour finds it odd that the Labour Department is continuing to release reports of an increase in skilled job vacancies on their Jobs Online when the Government is doing nothing to ensure that New Zealand’s 160,000 unemployed and 273,300 jobless are supported into full-time, meaningful jobs, says Labour’s Employment spokesperson Su’a William Sio.</p>
<p>“People need these jobs to support themselves and their families in a decent and dignified way, but the jobs are not being created.</p>
<p>“We still have women’s unemployment for the last quarter at 7.1 per cent, Maori unemployment at 13.9 per cent, Pacific at 16 per cent and ethnic communities at 9.4 per cent. We still have 87,000 young people aged 15 to 24 not in education, employment or training.</p>
<p>“If there is an increased number of skilled job vacancies, then why is it that the number of people still unemployed and jobless remains steady, despite thousands of Kiwis being forced to go across to Australia to find jobs,” Su’a William Sio said.</p>
<p>“This government seems to have run out of ideas. Will selling off state assets create more jobs? Yeah right!”</p>
<p>The promises they made to create jobs have been broken over and over again. Simply making promises to create 154,000 jobs in Budget 2012 represents reckless and unfounded optimism from John Key.</p>

<p>“National continues to recite through Paula Bennett that the numbers of people receiving the unemployment benefit are declining, but fails to recognise that the actual number of people becoming unemployed is rising,” Su’a William Sio said.</p>
<p>“How will unemployed people support themselves when there are moves afoot to push them off the unemployment benefit, with food banks drying up, and the Prime Minister is blaming Greece for his Government’s failures?</p>
<p>“Alarm bells are ringing in communities which are experiencing the full impact of continued unemployment and joblessness,” Su’a William Sio said. “How do they support themselves and their families if unemployment remains constant?”</p>
