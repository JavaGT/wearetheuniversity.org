<p><strong>Refugee health under the spotlight</strong></p>
<p>Today marks both World Refugee Day and the 60th anniversary since New Zealand became a signatory to the United Nations Convention on Refugees (UNHCR). But according to AUT academic Dr Shoba Nayar it’s time to re-examine refugee resettlement in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Currently New Zealand accepts up to 750 refugees per year under the UNHCR agreement and is one of fewer than 20 countries to offer a resettlement programme, but that could be set to change, says Dr Nayar.</p>
<p>“Next week we’ll be taking a closer look at refugee health, adaptation and contribution to New Zealand as part of the 5th International Asian &amp; Ethnic Minority Health &amp; Wellbeing Conference.</p>
<p>“The government recently proposed changes to the 2009 Immigration Act that would deter asylum seekers – a move which could potentially impact upon our country’s positive reputation in refugee and humanitarian matters,” says Dr Nayar, Associate Director of AUT University’s Migrant and Refugee Research Centre.</p>
<p>It’s the first time there has been a dedicated refugee health stream featured at the conference. As part of the 5th International Asian &amp; Ethnic Minority Health &amp; Wellbeing Conference, AUT hosts internationally renowned refugee expert, Professor Derrick Silove from the University of New South Wales, Australia. He will discuss refugee resettlement from an Australian perspective and consider what experiences New Zealand can learn from.</p>
<p>“Refugees coming to New Zealand have fled political conflict and often arrive with a range of mental and physical health needs. Working with organisations such as Refugees as Survivors, our role is to help improve the health and wellbeing of refugee communities in New Zealand - this also includes how they adapt and contribute to life here. As a society, we need to enhance our understanding of health needs to ensure we’re providing responsive and targeted health care delivery.”</p>
