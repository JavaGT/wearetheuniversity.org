<p>Massey engineer edits Olympic ICT publication</p>
<p>A Massey University chartered professional engineer has overseen a major publication outlining the innovations in information and communications technology being utilised at the London Olympics.</p>
<p>Dr Amal Punchihewa of the School of Engineering and Advanced Technology was the only scholar from outside the United Kingdom chosen to edit the document Delivering London 2012: ICT Enabling the Games. It was produced by the Institute of Engineering and Technology, of which Dr Punchihewa is a Fellow.</p>
<p>Dr Punchihewa says supplying the ICT requirements for the games is probably the largest project of its kind this century.</p>
<p>“Equipping the city with the infrastructure required was a massive project,” he says. “For example, the data demand for mobile devices, including phones, at venues is huge. Everyone attending probably has a mobile device, which they will want to use, so making sure they all can is vital.”</p>
<p>The Institute of Engineering and Technology produced the publication as part of a knowledge transfer initiative, designed to give businesses and academia the chance to connect with and understand major infrastructure projects for such critical events.</p>
<p>The publication contains papers on every aspect of the project; systems integration, super-fast fibre, mobile data, web development and sensing for athletic training.</p>
<p>Dr Punchihewa worked with colleagues in the United Kingdom to edit the publication and travelled to London to meet with the editorial team.</p>
<p>“I was honoured to be a part of the editorial team and to represent Massey University, which places such a great emphasis on sport science and technology,” he says.</p>
