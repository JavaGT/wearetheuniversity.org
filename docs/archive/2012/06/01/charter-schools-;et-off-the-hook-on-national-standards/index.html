<p><strong>Friday, 1 June 2012, 6:23 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZEI">NZEI</a></strong></p>
<p>1 June 2012</p>
<p>For Immediate Release</p>
<p>Government lets Charter Schools off the hook on National Standards</p>
<p>If the Government is making National Standards voluntary for charter schools it should give the same freedom to all other primary schools, NZEI Re Riu Roa National President, Ian Leckie said today.</p>
<p>The terms of reference for the NZ Model of a Charter School Working Group, released today, say that charter schools will not be required to follow the New Zealand Curriculum.</p>
<p>“The Government has repeatedly argued that National Standards are embedded in the New Zealand Curriculum and that its levels are linked to the levels within the Curriculum. If schools are not following the Curriculum, then National Standards are not a relevant set of achievement standards,” says Mr Leckie.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government must clarify whether the operating licences of charter schools are required to include National Standards targets.”</p>
<p>&quot;If charter schools do not have to comply with the Standards, then neither should the majority of New Zealand primary schools that know the Standards are inconsistent, unreliable and do nothing to improve children&#39;s learning.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Leckie says NZEI would oppose any moves to amend the Education Act to allow charter schools to employ unqualified teachers, adopt unfair performance pay systems, pick and chose students or make a profit at the expense of children&#39;s learning.</p>
<p>&quot;Our children&#39;s education is too important to leave to people making a quick buck or to well-intentioned but uninformed special-interest groups without the leadership of professional educators.&quot;</p>
