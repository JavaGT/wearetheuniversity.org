<p><strong>Māori Party disappointed that full impacts of education policy changes were not revealed</strong></p>
<p>Māori Party education spokesperson Te Ururoa Flavell has revealed his party’s disappointment that the full implications of education policy changes were not identified in pre-budget briefings.</p>
<p>“We are concerned that sufficient detail was not shared with us when we were briefed on the Budget and we will be advising the Prime Minister of our concern in this regard”.</p>
<p>“We do not think that classroom ratios are the only issue here.</p>
<p>We absolutely support the drive to lift quality and ensure the investment in achievement is translating into improved outcomes. We are committed to lifting achievement of all students and in particular Maori students because they along with their Pacific counterparts will make up a large part of the workforce in years to come.</p>
<p>We therefore want to be assured of the direct connection between the impacts of the policy changes and lifting achievement”.</p>
<p>“We are not convinced that the debate is adequately informed by evidence around what is the ideal ratio between teachers and students; and how much this matters to lifting achievement. We want to hear the views of parents, teachers and education agencies about what matters most in terms of increasing success in education.</p>
<p>We will also be asking for much greater clarity about the impacts of the policy change on technology education – and how this will in turn affect every student’s right to a full curriculum”.</p>
