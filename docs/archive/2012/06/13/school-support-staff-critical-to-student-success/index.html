<p><strong>School Support Staff critical to student success</strong></p>
<p>School support staff are the unsung heroes of the education system and need to be better recognized.</p>
<p>School Executive Officer, Gaye Parlane says increasing demands on teachers has meant more demands on support staff such as administration executives and teacher aids.</p>
<p>“Schools are employing more support staff and expecting more and more from them.”</p>
<p>Today is Support Staff Day and Mrs Parlane says this is an opportunity for schools and the community to focus on the critical role support staff have in our schools.</p>
<p>“This is a group that has become more professional over the years and is playing a huge part in the delivery of quality education.”</p>
<p>“Certainly most support staff are in the job because of a love of learning and teaching and quite frankly, schools would fall over without them”.</p>
<p>But unlike teachers, their wages are not centrally funded and their employment is under the control of schools which can result in less job security.</p>
<p>However, Gaye Parlane says today is a time to focus on the hugely positive contribution that Support Staff make to their school.</p>
<p>“This is an opportunity for the rest of the school community to celebrate their work and for support staff to also acknowledge that contribution.”</p>
<p>“So around the country, many schools will today be acknowledging Support Staff Day and taking a little time out to thank their support staff.”  </p>
