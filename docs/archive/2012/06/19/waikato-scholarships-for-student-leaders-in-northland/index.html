<p><strong>Waikato scholarships announced for student leaders in Northland</strong></p>
<p>Strong leadership and good citizenship among Northland students is being recognised in a new scholarship launched by the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>The university, which has a long-standing relationship with Northland, has announced the launch of 10 scholarships worth $5000 a year to Year 13 students from the region. The eligible secondary schools are in Kaipara (four), Whangarei (12) and the Far North (19).</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford is in Northland this week with the university’s Pro Vice-Chancellor Māori, Professor Linda Tuhiwai Smith. They will visit schools and host some stakeholder events to continue the university’s connection with the region.</p>
<p>“This scholarship has been designed specifically for the Northland region with which we have such strong ties. It recognises students who have demonstrated strong leadership and good citizenship within their school and community.”</p>
<p>Professor Crawford says in October each year, the principals of the 35 eligible schools will be invited to each nominate one Year 13 student for consideration. The first scholarships will be awarded at the end of this year for study in 2013.</p>
<p>Students must meet the criteria for entry to their chosen qualification and be planning to study full-time towards an undergraduate degree at the University of Waikato in the following year. The scholarships can be applied to fees or accommodation at the University of Waikato.</p>

<p>“The university has a wide variety of scholarships for undergraduate students, but we thought it was important to create a scholarship that starts seeking out the leaders of tomorrow for Northland,” Professor Crawford says. “We welcome many Northland students to Waikato each year, and we are always very pleased to see many of them return to their region and give back to their community – we see this scholarship as helping them on their way.”</p>
