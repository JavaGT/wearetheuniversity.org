<p>Nanaia<br>MAHUTA<br>Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>7 June 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Report card gives Government an F</strong></p>
<p>The Government has been ticked off for its poor performance in an education report card sent out by Labour’s Education spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta today.</p>
<p>“There were signs right from Year 1 that National didn’t see education as a priority with then Education Minister Anne Tolley slashing funding to adult community education. We’ve given her a C-.</p>
<p>“It didn’t get better the following year when Ms Tolley again demonstrated a lack of comprehension by slashing $275 million from early childhood education and pushing up fees for parents of our youngest learners. That earned a D-.</p>
<p>“The Government pulled up its socks ever so slightly in 2011 with its reversal of ECE policy but its enthusiasm for the assignment was short-lived. Hence we’ve given it C+.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately ‘new entrant’ Hekia Parata has shown little improvement. She has been uncooperative and disruptive. Failure to do any homework has put her at risk of suspension, or possibly expulsion,” Nanaia Mahuta said.<br>“While the Minister claims that only 10 per cent of all schools will be affected by her behaviour she is unable to provide the evidence to support those claims. Meanwhile the education sector is arguing that many more schools will be hit by the ratio changes.</p>
<p>“The Minister has also claimed that investing in quality teachers is critical, yet she fails to explain how capping teacher numbers at current levels for the next four years will impact on classroom learning..</p>

<p>“Larger classes are no substitute for teachers being able to spend quality time with students in a dynamic learning environment. Labour will reverse National’s policy because it makes no sense if we want all our children to get the best start at school and stay engaged in learning.</p>
<p>“Ms Parata must try harder. She lacks listening skills and has shown she has trouble with numbers. We’re giving her an F,” said Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
