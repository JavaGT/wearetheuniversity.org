<p><strong>John Key should apologise to parents and ask Minister to stand aside</strong></p>
<p>John Key must take responsibility for the class size debacle, apologise to New Zealand parents and instruct his Education Minister to stand aside, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>“It’s fantastic that the Government recognises its mistake and has made a full back-down over teacher class size increases,” Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said.</p>
<p>“But the Prime Minister needs to take responsibility for the mess he has left the education sector in.</p>
<p>“John Key has been 100 per cent behind this policy from the beginning and has continued to defend it even as the real impact of the cuts became known.</p>
<p>“He has destabilised the education system, lost the faith of the entire schools sector and caused enormous angst among New Zealand parents</p>
<p>“It is now impossible for Ms Parata to continue as Education Minister when she has alienated the entire sector.</p>
<p>“But the whole responsibility for this mess should not rest on her shoulders</p>
<p>“John Key should remove Ms Parata as minister and apologise to parents, teachers and children for his continual defence of the class size policy.</p>
<p>“For the sake of the education of New Zealand children, we need a fresh start where the voices of parents children and teachers are listened to.</p>
<p>“Mr Key should then instruct his new Minister to engage with the education sector in a respectful way in order to understand what schools and students really need.</p>
<p>“Nothing this Government has done has encouraged good teacher performance, which it claimed was its primary aim,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
