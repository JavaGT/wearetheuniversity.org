<p><strong>Key Misleads NZ about Economic Growth – Peters</strong></p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters has accused the Prime Minister of consistently misleading New Zealanders about this country’s economic growth compared to Australia.</p>
<p>Latest figures from across the Tasman show the Australian economy growing at an annual 4.3 per cent to the March quarter. This compares to New Zealand’s annual growth of 1.4 per cent in the year to December 2011.</p>
<p>Mr Peters says for weeks John Key has been boasting that the New Zealand economy is doing better than Australia.</p>
<p>“The truth is that the Aussies are doing about three hundred per cent better than us. This is why Kiwis are sprouting wings and flying to the ‘lucky country’ at the rate of a thousand a week.</p>
<p>“While Mr Key is acting like a fawning colonial overseas, tens of thousands of New Zealanders have fled from a ‘brighter future’ under a National government.</p>
<p>“When he returns to inflict more misery, Mr Key will have to explain why the real growth comparison between New Zealand and Australia bears no resemblance to the spin he has been spouting in Parliament,” says Mr Peters.</p>
