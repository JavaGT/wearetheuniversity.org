<p>Nanaia Mahuta<br>Education Spokesperson</p>

<p><strong>National misled Kiwis on class size plan</strong></p>
<p>John Key and his Education Minister must explain why they chose not to reveal their plan to increase class sizes to voters before the election despite evidence proving they were pursuing the idea, says Labour’s Education Spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
<p>“Treasury documents released today clearly show that in a pre-Budget briefing in September 2011, it was suggested that detailed work be undertaken on ‘adjusting student to teacher ratios’.</p>
<p>“This shows at least two months before the election National was actively pursuing the idea but essentially hid it from voters in November by not including it in their manifesto.</p>
<p>“The documents also show that the policy was almost fully developed by January 24 – further evidence that as soon as the election was over National put its officials to work on it.</p>
<p>&quot;Hekia Parata must also explain why she signed off on the class sizes policy without getting a breakdown of exactly how many teachers each school would lose.</p>
<p>“Documents released today show that she only received a list of how many would lose 1, 2 or 3 teachers the day before she made the announcement. At best this is negligent, at worst it is downright incompetence to sign-off such a major policy without understanding the impact on children’s learning.</p>
<p>“It’s clear from the papers that Hekia Parata knew how badly the policy would be received but didn’t bother trying to get the sector on board.</p>

<p>“A May 10 Cabinet paper notes: ‘there has been no opportunity for sector groups and other agencies to review and comment on the Order and this may be perceived negatively, particularly by sector groups as the changes are likely to be highly controversial’.</p>
<p>“It beggars belief that the Minister would be so naive as to think she could get away with brushing off the concerns of parents and teachers.<br>&quot;National got this badly wrong. But what is of real concern, is that despite the backtrack, John Key and Hekia Parata still think increasing class sizes is a good idea.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents and teachers will rightly be wondering what else they&#39;re cooking up behind the scenes,” said Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
