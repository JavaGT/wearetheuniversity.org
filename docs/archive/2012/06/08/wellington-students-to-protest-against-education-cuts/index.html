<p>Wellington students to protest against education cuts  </p>
<p>Students from Massey and Victoria Universities will converge on Victoria University today to demonstrate against the recent education cuts, as well as in solidarity with the Auckland university students brutally attacked by police last week.</p>
<p>The event will involve students speaking about their personal experiences as tertiary students, struggling to get through their education, with the added work and job fears involved in studying at the modern day university.</p>
<p>“These are the first steps involved in actually stepping up and saying that what is going on is wrong and that we need to move forward and not backwards, cuts never make anything better” says student Emily Haskell.</p>
<p>Recent changes to the funding of tertiary education have made accessibility an issue.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re gathering today so that students voices can be heard, whether Bill English wants to listen or not. As long as he continues to pursue failed 80s policy, students will be gathering to protest and create solutions to a government that is failing educators and students&quot;. Says postgrad Amanda Thomas.</p>
<p>“We are stepping up and speaking out, because these are rights that have been won by past generations, if we don’t use these rights and defend them, then they will disappear. Auckland students have show us, that we have to defend these rights in the face of both university and police intimidation” Says Emily.</p>
<p>Students will begin assembling at 1pm</p>
