<p><strong>Tuesday, 26 June 2012, 4:24 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong><br>26 June 2012</p>
<p><strong>An Olympian Gathering Of Poets</strong></p>
<p>A selection of esteemed New Zealand poets will rub shoulders with some of the world’s biggest names in poetry, as part of a cultural festival surrounding the London Olympics.</p>
<p>The Poetry Parnassus, due to kick off in London today, brings together one poet from each Olympic competing nation in what will be the biggest-ever UK poetry festival.</p>
<p>Four people with close Victoria University connections, including inaugural New Zealand Poet Laureate Professor Bill Manhire, have been chosen as part of the line-up.</p>
<p>Bill Manhire—Director of Victoria’s International Institute of Modern Letters—will represent New Zealand, Pacific Studies lecturer Dr Teresia Teaiwa will represent the Pacific nation of Kiribati, and Creative Writing Master’s graduates Kapka Kassabova and Tusiata Avia will represent Bulgaria and Samoa respectively.</p>
<p>Never have so many poets and so many languages been together in one place, with each poet contributing a poem in their own language.</p>
<p>Bill Manhire is delighted with the selections. “It’s wonderful that four poets with Victoria connections have been chosen to be part of this event—even though we’re representing different countries. The whole week is going to be an astonishing mix of the local and the global.”</p>
<p>Kapka Kassabova says that the world doesn’t often see an Olympic congregation of poets. “It will either be alarming or exhilarating to the public—and the poets! It will be eye- and ear-opening, I think, to be reminded that the world only speaks English some of the time.”</p>
