<p>Louisa WALL<br>MP for Manurewa<br>17 June 2012</p>
<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Volunteers are the Backbone of our Community</strong></p>
<p>Volunteers are the backbone of our community and we should celebrate the contribution they make to our society, says Labour’s Community and Voluntary Sector spokesperson Louisa Wall.<br> <br>“The work that volunteers do in our communities is mind-boggling and inspirational. From the mums and dads who coach and referee their children’s sports teams to the community groups who pass out food parcels, advice and sometimes just smiles for families in need. Every day volunteers are making a difference to someone’s life.”<br> <br>Next week is Volunteer Awareness Week (17-23 June) and is a chance for us to thank and celebrate the volunteers in our communities, said Louisa Wall.<br> <br>“Life can be tough sometimes. In Manurewa, as in other communities, I know a volunteer is dropping off a hot meal to someone who can’t get to the supermarket. Another volunteer is driving someone to their hospital appointment. And another volunteer is walking around the Southmall shopping centre ready to give advice or lend a helping hand if it’s needed.<br> <br>“Without volunteers life would be a little bit harder for everyone.<br> <br>“On Monday I’ll be volunteering in my electorate at the Rā Wiri Community Centre, Rata Vine, because they are one of thousands of organisations that epitomise the theme of this year’s Volunteer Awareness Week – <em>Building Communities through Volunteering</em>.<br> <br>“I encourage everyone to get involved. You never know who you might meet, what skills you might learn, or what new opportunities may come your way,” said Louisa Wall.<br> <br><em>For more information about Volunteer Awareness Week or to find out how you can get involved go to</em> <a href="http://www.volunteeringnz.org.nz/"><em>www.volunteeringnz.orgnz</em></a></p>
