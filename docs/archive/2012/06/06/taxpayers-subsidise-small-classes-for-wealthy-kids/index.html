<p>Taxpayers subsidise small classes for wealthy kids</p>
<p>If the Education Minister is convinced money is wasted keeping class sizes small, she should instruct private schools to increase their sizes too, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>Education Minister Hekia Parata has increased class sizes, saying education money is better spent elsewhere.</p>
<p>“More than $57 million a year in taxpayer funding is given to private schools, such as St Cuthbert’s and Kings College, which promote small classes as a great thing for learning,” Green Party education spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said.</p>
<p>“By allowing these schools to keep their student teacher ratios low, the Government is effectively subsidising lower class sizes for wealthy children.</p>
<p>“As underprivileged children struggle in classes of nearly 30 pupils, wealthy kids have their class sizes capped at half that.</p>
<p>“That is blatantly unfair.”</p>
<p>Research shows that Māori, Pacific and other vulnerable learners suffer in larger class sizes.</p>
<p>“These children are disproportionately represented in the bottom 20 per cent of achievement levels.</p>
<p>“Ms Parata should look at reducing class sizes for kids who need more teacher time, rather than subsidising low class sizes for those who were always going to do well.</p>
<p>“Outrage over this policy shows no one wants their children in bigger classes, whether they’re rich or poor,” Ms Delahunty said.</p>
