<p>Dame Malvina hits another high note</p>
<p>University of Waikato ambassador Dame Malvina Major has been awarded one of the top honours in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list.</p>
<p>The international opera star moved from Canterbury University to take up a teaching and an ambassadorial role at the University of Waikato this year. She says she’s humbled by the award, becoming an Additional Member of the Order of New Zealand. Only 22 people hold the title.</p>
<p>Dame Malvina, who was conferred with an honorary doctorate from the University of Waikato in 1994, has a string of awards to her name. In 1991 she was made a Dame and was named New Zealander of the Year. She was named New Zealand Entertainer of the Year in 1992 and became a Principal Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2008 (this was changed to Grande Dame of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2009).</p>
<p>She says she was genuinely surprised to receive this latest award, and paid tribute to the people who have helped her over the years, including event volunteers and students involved in her teaching and mentoring.</p>
<p>Since beginning at the University of Waikato earlier this year as a Senior Fellow in Music, Dame Malvina says she has felt a sense of inclusiveness and has been hugely impressed with the talent being fostered through music at the university.</p>
<p>Dame Malvina was born in the Waikato and has lived in New Zealand, despite her stellar career taking her to many parts of the globe. She also has the Dame Malvina Foundation – designed to support the training of young New Zealand singers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Waikato alumnus and Chiefs assistant coach Wayne Smith was also named in the Queen’s Birthday honours – he received a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit. Other alumni to receive awards included Dr Ronald George Gibson (Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit), for services to veterinary science; Brian Mansel Diver, (Queen’s Service Medal) for services to youth sport; and Ariana Simpson, (Queen’s Service Medal) for services to Māori and the community.</p>
