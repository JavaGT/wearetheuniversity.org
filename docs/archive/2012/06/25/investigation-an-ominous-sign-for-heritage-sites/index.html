<p>Investigation an ominous sign for heritage sites</p>
<p>World heritage sites should be out of bounds for mining and drilling, says Labour’s Conservation spokesperson Ruth Dyson.</p>
<p>“The National Government’s move to investigate mineral wealth in world heritage sites on the West Coast is being promoted as harmless information gathering – but the reality is that investigation leads to excavation.</p>
<p>“Labour is not opposed to mining, but we stand firm in our view that world heritage sites should be treated in the same way as Schedule 4 land in national parks,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>“The surveying, of itself, will do no harm. But there is only one reason for this investigation and that is the future potential for exploration.</p>
<p>Reports suggest aeromagnetic surveying will be conducted in the South Island from Haast to Karamea, as well as sections of Te Waipounamu South West New Zealand world heritage area.</p>
<p>“Almost forty thousand people marched down Queen Street in Auckland with the message that these parts of our country are too precious to mine. The Government must listen.</p>
<p>“This isn’t about Labour opposing economic growth; this is about Labour opposing senseless, short-sighted excavation of our heritage areas.</p>
<p>“Nothing is sacred under this government. Using the façade of economic growth for projects like this is a feeble excuse from a government that has no plan and no vision.</p>
<p>“Selling our assets and allowing mineral exploration in our national parks and heritage sites shows National has scant regard for public opinion and for future generations.</p>
<p>“The Minister of Conservation, Kate Wilkinson, needs to take a stand on protecting these areas. She should not stand back and let her National Party colleagues ride rough-shod over her portfolio again,” Ruth Dyson said.<br>ends</p>
