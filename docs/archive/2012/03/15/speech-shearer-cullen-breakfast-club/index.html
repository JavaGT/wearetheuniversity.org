<p>15 March 2012<br>Cullen Breakfast Club</p>
<p>There&#39;s a story I&#39;d like to share with you.</p>
<p>You may know that P.T. Barnum was the man who founded the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.</p>
<p>He was a showman, he was a businessman, he was a scam artist.</p>
<p>Early in his career, he created an exhibit called The Happy Family.</p>
<p>It had just one cage, and in that cage there was a lion, a tiger, a panther, and a baby lamb.</p>
<p>It was a huge hit.</p>
<p>People would line up to see it.</p>
<p>And as it grew more and more popular, the newspapers would ask him what his plans were for this amazing display.</p>
<p>He said to them: &quot;It&#39;ll probably become a permanent feature - but only if the supply of lambs holds out.&quot;</p>
<p>In any sense you want to put it, literal or figurative, that&#39;s how we&#39;re running things in New Zealand.</p>
<p>We&#39;re going to keep on doing things the way we are ... for as long as the supply of lambs holds out.</p>
<p>We&#39;re going to go right on relying on property market bubbles and a small basket of primary produce exports to earn our living and we&#39;re going to go on borrowing money to pay for a standard of living we can&#39;t afford.</p>
<p>We owe too much. We all know that.</p>
<p>We earn too little. We all know that too.</p>
<p>Far too many of our eggs are in the one basket.</p>
<p>We all know that.</p>
<p>And anyone who tells you we can make things better here, without making big changes, is dreaming.</p>
<p>New Zealanders can cope with the truth.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s be honest with ourselves.</p>
<p>The honest truth is that the Christchurch recovery cheques from the insurance companies will only help us a bit.</p>
<p>The honest truth is that asset sales - even by the most generous measure - will hardly help us at all.</p>
<p>The honest truth is that a commodities boom, even if it keeps on rolling, isn&#39;t enough on its own to pay for what we need.</p>
<p>The honest truth is that merging and restructuring government departments will simply not cut it.</p>
<p>And the honest truth is that the economic plan New Zealand is following at the moment has more missing from it than it has in it.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s talk about what&#39;s missing. I need to use a delicate word….&quot;Vision&quot;.</p>
<p>A vision is a marvellous thing, but it&#39;s a bit like Excalibur.</p>
<p>You have to know what you&#39;re doing with it.</p>
<p>It&#39;s overused, it&#39;s often misused, and for a politician, it can be one of those &quot;kick me&quot; signs that you tape to your back.</p>
<p>But the fact is:</p>
<p>New Zealanders want their leaders to focus on the future.</p>
<p>They want their leaders to have a clear idea about where we&#39;re going, and how we&#39;re going to get there, and what we&#39;re going to do to make it happen.</p>
<p>My vision is straightforward:</p>
<p>New Zealand should be a place where people know that they can get ahead, a place where the rest of the world wants to live and a place that we can all be proud of.</p>
<p>I’ve got a strong sense of where I want to take New Zealand to achieve that vision, and what we need to do to get there.</p>
<p>Let me start with an example.</p>
<p>The former Finnish Prime Minister, Esko Aho, largely untested, came into office in 1991.</p>
<p>He was almost immediately faced with a banking crisis.</p>
<p>Jobs were disappearing.</p>
<p>Its stock market was tanking.</p>
<p>Its future was hugely doubtful.</p>
<p>Aho’s message to the Finnish people was blunt and honest:</p>
<p>They had big problems. No-one else was going to fix them.</p>
<p>And most importantly: only their brains and talent were going to take them forward.</p>
<p>Collectively, the people of Finland took that message on board.</p>
<p>They moved forward.</p>
<p>They transformed their economy through innovation and talent.</p>
<p>They put at the centre of everything they did great teachers and schools and great science, research and development.</p>
<p>Aho made bold decisions.</p>
<p>He was, I need to say, voted out at the next election.</p>
<p>He thought it was more important to make a difference than to get re-elected.</p>
<p>Though our prescription might differ, we could all take a lesson from that.</p>
<p>I can tell you that I have no interest in being a prime minister who just cautiously tinkers.</p>
<p>If you can&#39;t change things for the better, you have no business being in the 9th floor of the Beehive.</p>
<p>Today Finland’s economy is way ahead of ours.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, though, its problems were the same as ours.</p>
<p>Of course, twenty, and thirty, and forty years ago, we had those problems too.</p>
<p>We were talking about making changes even before Britain joined the common market in the early 70s.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve talked about added value, lamb-burgers, Knowledge Waves, and NZ Inc, and yet somehow success is still just over the horizon.</p>
<p>People have grown tired of hearing about it. Many of them are sceptical it&#39;ll ever happen.</p>
<p>At a certain point, you have to stop talking about what you&#39;re going to do, and start doing it.</p>
<p>If Finland, Singapore and Israel can change their small economies, then we can too, in our own NZ way.</p>
<p>We have to bite the bullet.</p>
<p>Not just a bit of tinkering here and some adjusting there and leaving the rest to the market.</p>
<p>A completely new New Zealand. I can forgive you if you have your doubts.</p>
<p>You have heard it all before. But let me put this to you: Everyone in this room knows the difference between a woolly plan and a rigorously-tested and well-conceived one.</p>
<p>I want to arrive in government on Day One with a detailed plan that will actually achieve a shift to a new, job-rich, high-value economy.</p>
<p>We won’t be waiting around for officials to give us cautious ideas and suggest a few adjustments.</p>
<p>We will be presenting them with detailed and far-reaching policies.</p>
<p>Labour will spend the next two years listening, drawing up our plans. We will accept the best ideas wherever they come from.</p>
<p>On Day One in office we will be ready to go.</p>
<p>I know there is some expectation that I will bring the whole plan here today and lay it all out, but that&#39;s not the way I intend to put our policy together.</p>
<p>I intend to do it step by thorough step.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be talking in detail about just one of those steps today.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s be clear: I&#39;m not going to offer up some magic bullet.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t believe in them.</p>
<p>What I do believe in is getting your plan right, and then having the guts to follow it.</p>
<p>If I had to sum up what we need to do in one sentence I&#39;d say this: we need to make a new New Zealand.</p>
<p>That’s what the next Labour government will be about.</p>
<p>That means looking at everything through a whole new lens.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>It means questioning the comfortable assumptions we make.</p>
<p>Let me give you a few examples.</p>
<p>We like to flatter ourselves that New Zealand is clean and green and pristine. But really our green credentials owe more to our small population and a strong south-westerly.</p>
<p>In reality we fall well behind environmental standards of many European countries.</p>
<p>Our environment should be seen as a driver of our economic success rather than a hindrance.</p>
<p>We have smart, creative people and a clean, green branding. It’s a combination that other countries would die for.</p>
<p>My aim is to make that branding a reality.</p>
<p>Let me give you another example.</p>
<p>We like to think that we&#39;re a great exporting nation.</p>
<p>But how accurate a description is that when fewer than 900 companies export more than $5 million a year?</p>
<p>What if we were to set a target of 2000, and then 4000 and then 10,000 companies to hit that mark?</p>
<p>Yes, setting the goal is the easy part.</p>
<p>Making it happen is where we keep coming unstuck.</p>
<p>It&#39;s much, much easier to just say &quot;Oh let&#39;s dig up our precious conservation land for minerals, or turn more land into dairy farms.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s far harder to say &quot;let&#39;s make a Nokia, like they did in Finland.&quot;</p>
<p>And of course if you ask Nokia, they&#39;ll tell it&#39;s no picnic trying to stay on top once you&#39;ve got there.</p>
<p>There is no limit to the number of times we can create a Navman, or an Orion Health, selling health software across the globe,</p>
<p>Or a deal like the one Auckland UniServices did a few months ago to sell their wireless power technology to Qualcomm – but kept their intellectual property in NZ.</p>
<p>Or the cooperative Westland Milk who told me when I met them last week that they will generate 25% of their revenues from adding value to milk and have their sights set on 45% in the coming years.</p>
<p>They are all examples of high value technologies developed right here by smart New Zealanders.</p>
<p>The only limit to how many more times we can do that is the number of skilled people we have living here working on those ideas.</p>
<p>But as good as New Zealand is at it, there&#39;s a ceiling to how much butter and beef and meat and milk you can make off New Zealand grass. You hit the limit a long time before you get to be as prosperous as Australia.</p>
<p>So we need to take a fresh look at everything we do – and we need to ask ourselves if it really works.</p>
<p>If ideas help to build a new New Zealand, we like them.</p>
<p>If they don’t, then out they go.</p>
<p>That starts at home with Labour policy.</p>
<p>For example, we campaigned last year on a bold fiscal policy, with a new capital gains tax, and a $5000 tax free zone.</p>
<p>Now I won’t be setting out our fiscal policy today but I can tell you how I see things.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always believed the best argument in favour of a capital gains tax was the economic effect it had.</p>
<p>A CGT is pro-growth. It helps switch investment from sectors such as housing, to the productive sector where we desperately need more capital.</p>
<p>Over time I can also see the revenue it raises being used to offset the tax you have to pay in other areas.</p>
<p>So I can see a role for CGT in transforming our economy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I would want to ask whether a tax-free zone that gives everyone the same sized tax cut is going to be as much of a priority.</p>
<p>I believe we can look after everyone better, not by cutting taxes, but by earning more as a country and making sure that everyone gets a real chance to earn their share.</p>
<p>Let me be clear: these are policy matters that won&#39;t be confirmed until much nearer the election.</p>
<p>But I present them today as examples that inevitably arise when you ask that larger overarching question: does this help to build the new New Zealand?</p>
<p>We have to run a healthy, growing economy.</p>
<p>Any government I lead is going to be thrifty.</p>
<p>New Zealanders can trust Labour to manage the books.</p>
<p>Labour is going to have a responsible plan to create a new economy.</p>
<p>I want to look today at the very first, and arguably the most important part, of our plan in a bit more detail.</p>
<p>I want this new New Zealand to be built on our skills and talent that is finely tuned to compete with the best in the world.</p>
<p>I frankly doubt that the education system we have today can do what we&#39;ll be asking of it.</p>
<p>Education is everything. We know that.</p>
<p>Get that right, and everything flows from it. My own experience has taught me that.</p>
<p>I was hired at one time by Save the Children to work in Sri Lanka where a war was being fought between the government in the south and the Tamil Tiger rebels in the north.</p>
<p>I was given a job of taking exam papers across the front line from the government side to the rebel side.</p>
<p>It meant travelling down a single road that was mined on either side.</p>
<p>Eventually we got the exam papers around the various schools.</p>
<p>I stopped to talk at one place to community leaders about why exam papers - of all things - were so important to them.</p>
<p>I asked them: why hadn’t we brought them medicine, or food, that were critically in short supply?</p>
<p>I still remember their answer.</p>
<p>They told me that all those other supplies would help with the needs of today, but only an education offered opportunity to those children.</p>
<p>Education could break the cycle of deprivation they were in.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re prepared to invest in the future, your fate can change.</p>
<p>Now, what happens if we put this in the New Zealand context?</p>
<p>The first thing we can say is this: we have some very high-achieving children and some high-achieving schools.</p>
<p>The best and the brightest do very well and I am proud of them.</p>
<p>But I&#39;m not just interested in the bunch that leads the marathon into the stadium.</p>
<p>Some of them are outstanding and the very best of them finish their race in world record time.</p>
<p>They’re an inspiration for the others.</p>
<p>But if you track back along the rest of the field, it doesn’t look so world class.</p>
<p>Many of them are coming in hours later.</p>
<p>Many of them are giving up before the finish.</p>
<p>And too many of them aren&#39;t even turning up at the starting line.</p>
<p>We have a long tail of failure.</p>
<p>We have to fix it.</p>
<p>It’s important to acknowledge that some of the fixes need to happen outside the school gate, in homes where children grow up in poor or dysfunctional families.</p>
<p>I’ve spent my life fighting for children in this situation. I want them to succeed.</p>
<p>That’s why my goals for education are ambitious.</p>
<p>I won’t be satisfied until every child in New Zealand is getting an excellent education, and until every child in New Zealand is being equipped to flourish.</p>
<p>There is so much more we can do than we&#39;re doing right now.</p>
<p>Instead of the distraction over national standards, we need to focus on how we get the highest quality teachers in the world and the best performing students.<br>Not just a better system, the best.<br>I want the best educational achievement in the world.<br>What do we have to fix, then?</p>
<p>Study after study shows that the most important ingredient is the quality of teachers.</p>
<p>We need to value teachers.</p>
<p>We need every teacher in our classroom to be a good one.</p>
<p>The vast majority are. But the truth is some are not.</p>
<p>We will work with teachers to develop their professional skills, but ultimately we can’t afford to have bad teachers in our classrooms.</p>
<p>As a parent, I want to put badly run schools on notice.</p>
<p>I expect excellence from every school.</p>
<p>We need to spend more on early childhood education.</p>
<p>Experts agree a dollar spent on a child before five will save $11 spent on crime and welfare later.</p>
<p>We need to make the most of our great early interventions, such as reading recovery programmes.</p>
<p>We know they do a great job of picking up the kids who fall behind.</p>
<p>They&#39;ve been copied all over the world, and yet they&#39;re not available in every school in New Zealand.</p>
<p>We know that once kids miss that early start their chances of catching up are slim. We cannot miss that golden opportunity.</p>
<p>We know that if we reach into schools and give 16 year olds a track into other training before they drop out, we give them a chance of an entirely different life.</p>
<p>That opportunity should be available to every student.</p>
<p>If we&#39;re going to have those 10,000 high value export companies,</p>
<p>If we&#39;re going to have those high value export industries developing,</p>
<p>Then we have to do a much better job of education than we are right now.</p>
<p>Our children need to be equipped to do the job we&#39;re going to be asking them to do.</p>
<p>And they need to be getting the right signals.</p>
<p>Right now, they&#39;re following the money, and that means we&#39;re turning out an army of accountants.</p>
<p>Engineers and scientists, not so much.</p>
<p>How many Nokias are you going to make with just an army of accountants?</p>
<p>I&#39;m focusing today on education, because it&#39;s fundamental to remaking the country.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just one of many things we&#39;ll have to overhaul and I&#39;ll be talking about all of them over the weeks and months ahead.</p>
<p>But I&#39;ve chosen to start with education because it&#39;s such a good example of something we imagine we&#39;re doing right, but where we need to excel and lead the world.</p>
<p>People worry about the direction of the country because of the number of people on welfare.</p>
<p>The fact is there are 83,000 young people not in training or work.</p>
<p>I want to fix that and the place to start is in education.</p>
<p>That’s where the opportunities are being missed.</p>
<p>Everything else is bottom of the cliff stuff.</p>
<p>Every child should get the opportunity to be taught by great teachers, in great schools, no matter who they are, or where they live.</p>
<p>That’s fair.</p>
<p>We all have an instinctive sense in New Zealand that everyone deserves a go, and that everyone needs to pull their weight and contribute.</p>
<p>Labour believes that. It always has.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t let anyone tell you different.</p>
<p>We say two things:</p>
<p>Number one: our community must take care of the needy. They deserve a share of the pie.</p>
<p>And if people fall on hard times, we will help.</p>
<p>But equally importantly, number two: everyone who can help to make that pie needs to be involved, and fairly rewarded for doing it.</p>
<p>Rights and responsibilities, that’s the social contract that binds our society.</p>
<p>The government’s part is to ensure that this transition happens – through up-skilling, education and a nudge behind those not meeting their side of the contract.</p>
<p>It’s something I will talk about more as part of a series of speeches in the coming weeks and months as we set out our plans to make a new New Zealand.</p>
<p>The new New Zealand that we want to build won&#39;t just be doing more and earning more, it&#39;ll be making sure that people get to earn a fair share in the work they do.</p>
<p>This new New Zealand will be the kind of place the rest of world would like to live.</p>
<p>It will be clean,<br>it will be green,<br>it will be clever …<br>and it will be a place that&#39;s good for lambs.</p>
