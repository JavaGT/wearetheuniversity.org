<p>16 March 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>South Dunedin’s Got Talent Show focus on the positives in the community</strong></p>
<p>South Dunedin’s Got Talent will be held for the third time this Sunday, drawing a wide variety of entries across the community and focussing on the positives in our community, Dunedin South MP Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>Entries for the event have been received from young and old, and from a number of family groups. The items include dancing, singing, music ranging from Country and Western music to Original songs, and cultural displays. Eighteen entries will audition during the afternoon.</p>
<p>All of Dunedin is invited to the Mayfair Theatre on Sunday March 18 for an afternoon and evening of entertainment, starting with audition heats starting at 1p.m. followed by a Showcase of winners at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>“This is the third time this event has been held in South Dunedin,” Clare Curran said. “This year it forms part of the South Dunedin Festival, which runs all weekend.</p>
<p>“The entrants have told us the good shops, friendly people, the ‘can do’ attitude and entertainment in the suburb make them proud of South Dunedin.”</p>
<p>MC for the event is local Drama teacher and performer Anita Cummings.</p>
<p>The event has attracted sponsors, including Tangles Hair Design, Headquarters, Cut Away to Colour, Countdown, Pier 24 at St Clair resort, Bunning’s Warehouse, ABSolute Gym, Texas Hold’em Poker League, Cadburys, The South Dunedin Business Association, and The Mayfair Theatre, with a special thank you to the Dunedin City council for the community funding towards the cost of this event, and to students from Kings who are helping with front of house.</p>
<p>“A gold coin admission charge will be used to defray expenses, and you are sure to enjoy the entertainment which will include some interesting surprises” said Clare Curran, who will be presenting the prizes to the first, second and third place winners, and to the winner of the People’s choice award.</p>
