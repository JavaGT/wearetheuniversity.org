<p><strong>Wednesday, March 28, 2012</strong><br><strong>Kiwi Teachers ‘Good Value For Money’</strong></p>
<p>Education spending by government on primary and secondary students is lower than the OECD average but New Zealand teachers are among the highest performers, Massey University Professor John O’Neill says.</p>
<p>Professor O’Neill, from the College of Education, says Treasury wants to increase student-teacher ratios but chooses to ignore the “hard data” that show they are already higher than average.</p>
<p>In the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), New Zealand ranked fourth out of 34 OECD countries in reading, sixth in mathematics and fourth in science.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s annual expenditure per student is equivalent to US$5,573 per primary student and US$6,994 per secondary student.</p>
<p>The OECD average is US$7,153, and US$8,972 respectively.<br>“We spend less per student yet get impressive results,” Professor O’Neill says. “This suggests that our teachers overall do a great job and are cause for celebration not carping criticism.”</p>
<p>In the debate over whether to increase student-teacher ratios, Professor O’Neill says Treasury has failed to report that current New Zealand student-teacher ratios are one teacher to 16.3 students in primary, 16.3 in lower secondary and 12.8 in upper secondary schools. The equivalent OECD averages are 16.0, 13.5 and 13.5.</p>
<p>“In other words, our ratios need to be reduced overall to match the OECD average, not further increased,” Professor O’Neill says.</p>

<p>He also described as “misleading” criticism about the rising costs of schooling saying increases in Government funding were about catching-up on underfunding in past years.</p>
<p>Professor O’Neill says a simple way of looking at value for money from teachers as a whole is to divide total salary costs for teachers by the total number of students. New Zealand costs per student are US$14,986 in upper secondary (OECD average is US$16,989), US$11,888 in lower secondary (OECD average is US$14,956) and US$11,226 in primary (OECD average is US$11,545).</p>
<p>“Again New Zealand teachers appear to provide very good value for money to government and the country,” Professor O’Neill says.</p>
