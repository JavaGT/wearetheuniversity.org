<p><strong>Waikato MBA students face Dragon’s Den</strong></p>
<p>Waikato MBA students put themselves and their business prowess in the spotlight this week, taking part in the first University of Waikato Management School Dragon’s Den competition.</p>
<p>Like in the television programme, the 40 students from the University’s Centre for Corporate and Executive Education and the Waikato-Tainui College for Research and Development at Hopuhopu put their business ideas to the test in front of a panel of big-business leaders.</p>
<p>Lecturer Associate Professor Jens Mueller says the students who are one year into their two-year course are all experienced managers in their working lives, but not many have had the opportunity to develop a business plan or pitch new ideas to their boards.</p>
<p>“They’re applying everything they’ve learned on their course so far and have 25 minutes maximum to present their idea and answer questions from the judging panel.”</p>
<p>As part of the Dragon’s Den brief, contestants had to developing an idea and prepare a business plan including strategic decision-making, managing staff and stakeholder relationships, sales and marketing, and financials. They also had to show an understanding of risk and how to measure it.</p>
<p>Austen Clarke was part of winning group Vext Ltd from the afternoon round and said the Dragon’s Den competition was a great way to test the theory students had learnt in a real-world situation.</p>

<p>“For the Dragon’s Den presentation we had to write a 12,000 word report detailing almost every aspect of our business plan - there is no way we would have been about to put together the plan without what we’ve learnt doing the MBA and without help from the lecturers,” said Clarke.</p>
<p>Puna Ora Ltd won the morning session.</p>
<p>Waikato Management School Dean Frank Scrimgeour congratulated the students on the huge effort they had put in.</p>
<p>“It’s a great pleasure to see a lot of people who have done some hard work. The Dragon’s Den is not just a one off; it’s going to be the start of something new at the Waikato Management School.”</p>
<p>Judge Jeanette Bulteel-Adams, Chief Operating Officer from Waikato DHB, and a Waikato graduate, commended all the students saying she knew it was difficult to balance work and study.</p>
