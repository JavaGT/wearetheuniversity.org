<p><strong>UC Welcomes Govt. Announcement</strong></p>
<p>The Government’s announcement today that it is committing $5 million in funding over the next four years to help the international education sector in Christchurch achieve sustainable growth is being welcomed by the University of Canterbury, with Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr saying that it reflects significant confidence in the city’s education providers.</p>
<p>The Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment, Hon Steven Joyce, says an initial package of support is already underway, aiming to increase enrolments in 2012, 2013 and beyond. Other elements of the programme will include the development of an ongoing international marketing strategy, growth initiatives and increased collaboration between providers.</p>
<p>He says the Government has ambitious goals for New Zealand’s international education sector - doubling its economic value to $5 billion over the next 15 years - and Christchurch, as the second largest destination for international students in New Zealand, “plays an integral role in maintaining New Zealand’s reputation for high quality education.”</p>
<p>Dr Carr says the Government’s aspirations are shared by the University, which is looking forward to playing its role in growing the international education sector in Christchurch.</p>
<p>“International students not only bring economic value to the city, they also provide cultural enrichment – which is a crucial element of a world-class learning environment.”</p>
<p>Dr Carr says the spirit of collaboration promoted by the Government will encourage exciting developments within the education sector in Christchurch.</p>

<p>“Already, the University of Canterbury is working alongside Lincoln University and CPIT as the Canterbury Tertiary Alliance, with ENZ support, to promote overseas recognition of the network of education pathways available to any age-class of international students who choose to study in Christchurch. .”</p>
<p>Dr Carr says the University will also be working with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority and other providers on the development of an education recovery plan for the Canterbury region.</p>
