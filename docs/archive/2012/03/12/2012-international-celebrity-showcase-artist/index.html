<p>Australian pianist Piers Lane named as 2012 International Celebrity Showcase artist</p>
<p>This year’s Waikato University International Celebrity Showcase will feature London-based Australian pianist Piers Lane.</p>
<p>He will play a solo concert at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts on April 13.</p>
<p>Lane has a flourishing international career which has taken him to over 40 countries and seen him share the stage with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and write and present over 100 programmes for BBC Radio 3.</p>
<p>He has also been awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Griffith University in Queensland and been Artistic Director of the Australian Festival of Chamber Music since 2007.</p>
<p>Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts manager Jeremy Bell says Lane’s April 13 performance is testimony to the calibre of artists the International Celebrity Showcase concert continues to attract.</p>
<p>In the last two years the International Celebrity Showcase concert has featured internationally renowned pianists Nikolai Demidenko and Peter Jablonski.</p>
<p>“No praise could be high enough for Piers. He gets phenomenal reviews everywhere he goes and having him perform at the academy is a real gift,” says Bell.</p>
<p>“His programme begins with works by Bartok, Debussy and Liszt, and the second half is devoted to the complete waltzes of Chopin with Piers’ own introduction and commentary.”</p>
<p>The April 13 concert takes place at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts and starts at 8pm. Tickets are available from the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts or Ticketek and range from $45-$60</p>
