<p>12 March 2012<br><strong>Otago Rail Trail comes full circle</strong></p>
<p>The trail that helped inspire the New Zealand Cycle Trail project — the Otago Rail Trail — has been incorporated as a Great Ride in that same network, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>“The Otago Rail Trail was the first of its kind and encouraged communities around New Zealand to build their own unique trails, now collectively making up the New Zealand Cycle Trail,” said Green MP and Cycle Trail representative, Kevin Hague.</p>
<p>“It is a great honour to have the Otago Rail Trail added to the Cycle Trail network that it helped to inspire.”</p>
<p>Kevin Hague attended the unveiling celebrations at Middlemarch and Clyde along with the celebration half-way along the 157 kilometre trail at Oturehua. The Green Party is working jointly with the Government to realise a shared vision for a national cycle network.</p>
<p>“For many New Zealanders, the Otago Rail Trail has been their first significant ride on a bicycle since they were kids,” said Mr Hague.</p>
<p>“The Otago Rail Trail has bought many thousands of New Zealanders back into the healthy world of cycling.</p>
<p>“I have personally ridden the rail trail a number of times and have witnessed first-hand the development of a great cycling experience and the rejuvenation of local communities that has gone hand in glove with it.</p>
<p>“The Otago Rail Trail did the hard work of converting the sceptics, opening up the potential for cycle tourism opportunities throughout our beautiful country.</p>
<p>“The Cycle Trail concept is a smart way to build up the resilience of local rural economies.</p>
<p>“The Green Party continues to work constructively alongside the National Government to roll out quality cycling infrastructure throughout the country,” Mr Hague said.</p>
<p>“In this case, however, the hard work had already been done. All we had to do was turn up with the new signage and unveil it.”</p>
