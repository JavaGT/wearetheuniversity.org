<p><strong>Green Growth Report highlights Govt economic contradictions</strong>  </p>
<p>The Green Party welcomed the Government’s Green Growth Advisory Group Report out today and signalled it will work co-operatively with the National Government to implement the pick of its recommendations.</p>
<p>“The Government’s Green Growth Advisory Group has made important recommendations to protect and enhance our country’s fledgling green economy but, in doing so, has highlighted the contradictions of the National Government’s current economic strategy,” Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman said today.</p>
<p>“The Government’s strategy of picking winners in the petroleum, coal, and irrigation sectors is at odds with the picture of a smart green economy that this report paints.</p>
<p>“The Government needs to stop subsidising our old polluting industries and start backing our cleantech start-ups with a bright future ahead of them.</p>
<p>“Huge carbon and irrigation subsidies for agriculture are neither smart nor sustainable.”</p>
<p>The Report details a major structural problem with the New Zealand economy: Most of our high-earning export industries are carbon intensive and face significant challenges to lower their carbon footprint. The sectors identified as ‘services’ and ‘other’ (value-added manufacturing) have an extremely low carbon footprint.</p>
<p>“The service and high-tech manufacturing sectors are the future for our economy, yet this Report does not detail how to embrace or develop these industries,” Dr Norman said.</p>

<p>“For example, exporting beef is ten times more carbon intensive than exporting a service or a high-tech manufactured product.</p>
<p>“The Green Party has an economic plan that can address this blind spot.”</p>
<p>Dr Norman signalled his Party’s willingness to work with the National Government to advance smart green economic solutions.</p>
<p>“If the Government is serious about engaging with the Group’s recommendations, the Green Party is ready to work co-operatively with it to secure a stronger, more sustainable economic future for New Zealand,” Dr Norman said.</p>
<p>“The report picked up on many initiatives laid out in our Green Jobs economic plan delivered before the election last year and would, if implemented, create tens-of-thousands of cleantech jobs without damaging our future.</p>
<p>“The Green Party particularly supports the Report’s emphasis on greening small-and-medium enterprises (recommendations 3-7 &amp; 14-16), greater collaborative processes for the management of our scarce natural resources (recommendation 2), greater protection of our $20 billion clean green brand (recommendations 11-13), and the creation of a sovereign wealth fund for mineral royalties (recommendation 26).</p>
<p>“However, we question the Report’s suggestion that biodiversity offsetting is good for the environment. You can’t save the environment by destroying it at the same time.</p>
<p>“The Report also fails to address the big issue of having ongoing economic growth in a world of finite natural resources.”</p>
