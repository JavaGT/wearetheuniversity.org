<p><strong>The Unintended Consequences Of Abolishing Youth Rates<br>Press Release by ACT Leader John Banks<br>Monday, March 26 2012</strong></p>
<p>ACT Leader John Banks today expressed dismay at reports that the high level of youth unemployment is contributing to increasing depression and anxiety problems for teenagers.</p>
<p>“Employment is not only financially rewarding, it increases our skills, stimulates us mentality, and boosts our self-esteem,” Mr Banks said.</p>
<p>“ACT believes it is important that young people have the opportunity to experience the dignity of work, and is why we opposed the abolition of the youth minimum wage.</p>
<p>“Labour’s abolition of youth rates has seen youth unemployment skyrocket - an inevitable result of competition between young people and older, more experienced workers for the same rate of pay. Experience wins every time.</p>
<p>“University of Canterbury Economist Eric Crampton estimated that abolishing the youth minimum wage had put 13,100 youth, who would otherwise have been working, out of a job by the middle of last year.</p>
<p>“The abolition of youth rates has been a disaster - first pushing youth out of work, and now affecting their sense of self-worth.</p>
<p>“It is time we dropped this senseless Labour policy and reintroduced a youth minimum wage,” Mr Banks said.</p>
