<p><strong>Tertiary funding system at fault, not Vic Uni</strong></p>
<p>Accusations that Victoria University “rorts” the government’s tertiary education funding system highlight the model’s poor design and inadequacies, the Green Party says.</p>
<p>Green Party tertiary education spokesperson David Clendon said the Performance Based Research Fund (PBRF) was a poorly designed model for funding.</p>
<p>“The funding model imposes high compliance costs and inappropriately influences decisions that should be driven by academic rather than financial considerations, such appointments and programme decisions,” said Mr Clendon.</p>
<p>A summary report prepared by Bruce Corkill QC found no evidence to support assertions of dishonest or unethical behaviour at Victoria University.</p>
<p>“However, Bruce Corkill’s report does highlight the lack of transparency and trust in the process,” Mr Clendon said.</p>
<p>“As it is, the system places unnecessary stresses on our tertiary education institutions, forcing them into difficult positions.</p>
<p>“The PBRF model encourages excessive weighting on research records compared to other important qualities such as teaching ability and student engagement.</p>
<p>“The PBRF is heavily biased toward international publication, no matter how esoteric or narrowly focused, and disadvantages researchers focusing on New Zealand issues and challenges.</p>
<p>“We need to return to a more balanced and transparent funding model that would gain the confidence of everyone involved in the tertiary sector,” Mr Clendon said.</p>
