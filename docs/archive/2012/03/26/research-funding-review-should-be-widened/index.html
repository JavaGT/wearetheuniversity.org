<p>Grant Robertson<br>Deputy Leader<br>Tertiary Education, Skills and Training Spokesperson</p>
<p>26 March 2012</p>
<p><strong>Research funding review should be widened</strong></p>
<p>Allegations of gaming of the Performance Based Research Fund at Victoria University indicate a review of the scheme needs to have a wide remit to ensure it is a fair measure of the quality of research, Grant Robertson Labour Tertiary Education Spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“While Victoria University has said it could not find particular evidence of wrong doing here, allegations regarding the potential gaming of the PBRF system at other universities are rife. That’s a concern and one that should raise alarm bells.</p>
<p>“After the current 2012 round there is to be a further review of the system. That review needs to have a wide scope to ensure that PBRF is meeting its goals of promoting and rewarding high quality research,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>&quot;And it needs to happen alongside a wider consideration of how to recognize and reward other important elements of tertiary staff performance, including teaching and work with business and the community.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is value in promoting and rewarding quality research, but any measurement system will invite institutions to find ways of maximizing their result.</p>
<p>“Some of this behaviour is fed by the competition between institutions that sees tens of millions of dollars spent on marketing to domestic students.</p>
<p>“Labour favours a more collaborative system for tertiary education in New Zealand. We are a small country that needs to make the most of our scale while still supporting a quality system,&quot; Grant Robertson said.</p>
