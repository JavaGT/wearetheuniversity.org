<p><strong>Wednesday, 28 March 2012, 1:14 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Charter Schools Inquiry Needed</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party is questioning the impartiality of the Government’s Charter Schools Working Party and wants an inquiry into whether the schools should be established at all.</p>
<p>The Government today released the names of the members of the working group.</p>
<p>“As expected it will be headed by the former president of ACT, Catherine Isaac, but also includes Christchurch businesswoman Vicki Buck who is on record saying what a fabulous idea charter schools are,” Green Party Education Spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said.</p>
<p>“Having these two people in the group raises real questions about how neutral the group will be.</p>
<p>“Today I have written to the chair of the Education and Science Select Committee calling for an inquiry into the benefits of charter schools to the education system and to student learning.</p>
<p>“We don’t have a clear idea of the terms of reference for the working group.</p>
<p>“We need a careful and objective inquiry into the benefits, or not, of the charter school idea rather than launching headlong into some risky scheme and then tinkering with the problems when they arise.</p>
<p>“The Green Party has real concerns about the damage the charter schools experiment could wreak on the children who get caught up in it, and the syphoning of precious funds away from schools that need them now,” Ms Delahunty said.</p>
