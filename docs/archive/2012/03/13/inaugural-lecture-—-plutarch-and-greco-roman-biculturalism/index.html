<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong></p>

<p><strong>Inaugural Lecture—<em>Being Greek under Rome: Plutarch and Greco-Roman Biculturalism</em></strong></p>
<p>Classics Professor Jeff Tatum will deliver his inaugural lecture about being Greek under the Roman Empire on Tuesday 20 March.</p>
<p>By studying the career of Plutarch, the most important Greek writer of imperial Rome, Professor Tatum will explore questions around how Greek and Roman cultures co-existed, “an issue that is relevant for any multicultural society,” Professor Tatum says.</p>
<p>Professor Tatum explains that Plutarch’s masterpiece, <em>Parallel Lives of Eminent Greeks and Romans</em> is perhaps the most influential of all ancient biographies and a model for modern notions of life writing.</p>
<p>“It is also a crucial window to the classical past, for historians and artists alike, inspiring, for instance, Shakespeare’s <em>Coriolanus, Julius Caesar</em>, and <em>Antony and Cleopatra</em>.”</p>
<p>Plutarch’s career and his writings raise questions about what it meant to be Greek in Greco-Roman society, says Professor Tatum.</p>
<p>“It is unclear whether the term Greco-Roman implies a unification of two cultures, harmonious biculturalism or something in the way of unavoidable antagonism brought about by one culture’s political domination of the other.”<br>Roman culture was always, in varying degrees, Greco-Roman, but the right balance was always uncertain—Greek culture defined but could also threaten Roman identity.<br>Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says Victoria’s Inaugural Lecture series is an opportunity for professors to provide the wider community with an insight into their specialist area of study.</p>
