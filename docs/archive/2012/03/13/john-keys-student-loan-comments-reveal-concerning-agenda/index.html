<p><strong>John Key’s student loan comments reveal concerning agenda</strong></p>
<p>John Key’s comment that the student loan scheme will be reined in “in a big way” will be bad news for students, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>“While I welcome John Key’s commitment to retaining interest-free student loans for some, I am concerned about the implications of his comments for access to tertiary education,” Green Party Students and Youth Spokesperson Holly Walker said.</p>
<p>“Any moves to restrict access to student loans and allowances will prevent potential students from up-skilling and retraining, when this is exactly what we need them to do in these recessionary times.”</p>
<p>I am concerned that changes to the student loan scheme could result in fewer students accessing tertiary study, especially those from low-income backgrounds for whom alternative sources of funding are not available.</p>
<p>“The National-led Government has already restricted access to tertiary study in a number of ways.</p>
<p>“Changing University Entrance eligibility criteria, restricting access to the Training Incentive Allowance, and stopping Permanent Residents from accessing Studylink are all moves that increased barriers to higher education.</p>
<p>“John Key’s comments also reveal his Government’s attitude towards students and young people,” said Ms Walker.</p>
<p>“His implication that they are too lazy to “get out of bed before 7 o’clock at night to vote” shows their policy is not about what is best for students but what he thinks is best for National’s vote.”</p>
<p>The news comes on the same day that Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce has proposed publishing tables of average earnings for graduates for certain courses.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce claims he wants to solve the problem of 16 year-olds making poor subject choices at school and finding themselves ineligible for tertiary study later, but a more effective way to do this is to preserve open access to tertiary education, including student loans,” said Ms Walker.</p>
