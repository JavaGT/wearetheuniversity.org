<p>13 March 2012</p>
<p><strong>Election of a student member of University of Waikato Council for 2012</strong></p>
<p>Later this month the University of Waikato will conduct an election for the 2012 student member of the University Council.</p>
<p>The Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Act 2011 came into force on January 1, 2012. This legislation made membership of student unions voluntary. At the University of Waikato, it had been compulsory – now students have a choice whether or not to opt in.</p>
<p>Under compulsory Waikato Students’ Union (WSU) membership, the President of the WSU was automatically the student member on Council. From 2012, an annual election will be held to determine the student member on Council. All enrolled students are eligible to nominate someone or be nominated as a candidate, and to vote for the member they prefer.</p>
<p>The role of the student member on Council is an important one. The Council is responsible for the governance of the University and is the highest decision-making committee at the University. The student member will be expected to attend and participate at Council meetings (normally six each year) and take part in a range of related events and occasions. As well as being on Council, the student member may also have a seat on other high-level University committees.</p>
<p>Nominations for candidates for the 2012 election open on <strong>Monday 19 March</strong> and close at <strong>12.00 noon</strong> on <strong>Friday 30 March</strong>. If more than one valid candidate is nominated, an online election will be held. Campaigning will start on <strong>Monday 2 April</strong>, and voting will open on <strong>Wednesday 11 April</strong> and close on <strong>Friday 27 April</strong>.</p>
<p>Further information about the nomination process and the election more generally is available at <a href="http://www.waikato.ac.nz/about/corporate/student-member">www.waikato.ac.nz/about/corporate/student-member</a>.</p>
<p>Any questions about the role and expectations of Council members or the election more generally should be directed to the Returning Officer at <a href="mailto:council@waikato.ac.nz">council@waikato.ac.nz</a>.</p>
