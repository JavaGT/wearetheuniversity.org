<p>11 March 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>Labour expresses sympathy to Japan on quake anniversary</p>
<p>Labour sends its sympathy and best wishes to the people of Japan on the anniversary of the devastating earthquake that struck east Japan on 11 March 2011, says Labour MP Su’a William Sio.</p>
<p>“At today’s remembrance ceremony, I conveyed to the Consul-General of Japan, HE Mr Hachidro Ishido, Labour’s sincere sympathies to him personally, to the people of Japan and especially the relatives of the 20,000 people who died or are still missing since the earthquake and tsunami struck one year ago.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders know all too well the devastation caused by such an earthquake, given what we have experienced in Canterbury. We remember how fortunate we were at that time to have so many countries, including Japan, come to our aid. In turn, when Japan’s east coast was destroyed by the full force of a violent earthquake and tsunami, New Zealand reciprocated by sending our own Urban Search and Rescue teams to assist the Japanese people.</p>
<p>“On the occasion of Japan’s Remembrance Ceremony for the Great East Japan Earthquake, I reflect on an old Samoan saying: ‘He who comes to my aid are kin’. It is times like this when we recognise the significant value of our human relationships and connectedness during our hour of need.</p>
<p>“Japan has strong relationships with the Pacific and continues to play a vital role in the development of the Pacific region with a focus on education, health, economic policy and environmental management as channelled through the Japanese International Cooperation Agency.</p>
<p>“We pay tribute to their contribution and pass on our deepest respects to the Japanese people on this day on remembrance and reflection.”<br>ends  </p>
