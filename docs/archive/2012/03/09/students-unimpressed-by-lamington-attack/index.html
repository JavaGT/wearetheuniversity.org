<p><strong>Students unimpressed by lamington attack</strong></p>
<p>Students at the University of Auckland are outraged by a sole protestor’s behaviour today during a session with Auckland Mayor, Len Brown.</p>
<p>After an hour long session with students, Brown was surrounded by protestors angry about the on-going dispute between the Maritime Union and the Ports of Auckland.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the session, one protestor approached Mr Brown and smeared a lamington on Mr Brown’s face and suit.</p>
<p>This protestor was not a current student at the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>“It’s unfortunate that the Mayor in the Chair session ended like this. What was a rare opportunity for students to speak with the mayor about Auckland wide concerns was cut short.” says Daniel Haines, Vice-President of Auckland University Students’ Association. “We hope the actions of one individual will not prevent the Mayor from returning to Campus to engage with students in the future.”</p>
<p>Students who got the chance to speak with Brown appreciated having their questions and concerns addressed. This session provided a unique insight into the direction of Auckland’s future.</p>
<p>“Throwing cake isn&#39;t protest. It&#39;s a childish act of aggression,&quot; says Arena Williams, President of the Auckland University Students’ Association. &quot;Plenty of students were able to articulate their views on the Ports of Auckland dispute rationally and respectfully.&quot;</p>
<p>“Auckland University Students’ Association takes pride in the public events in the Quad and though they can become politically charged, no visiting leader should ever feel threatened or unable to engage with the students there.”</p>
<p>The Students’ Association Executive Members will discuss actions against the people involved in their executive meeting held on Monday evenings.</p>
