<p><strong>Waikato University launches Tess Embling Memorial Scholarship</strong></p>
<p>The University of Waikato has launched a new scholarship in honour of a student who died from cancer in 2010.</p>
<p>Faculty of Science and Engineering staff members Fiona Clarkson and Catherine Bryan have created a scholarship to celebrate the life and achievements of friend and classmate Tess Embling.</p>
<p>The Tess Embling Memorial Scholarship is aimed at Masters students in the Faculty of Science and Engineering who have a love of nature and a passion for their studies.</p>
<p>The annual $1500 scholarship is available to all Masters students in the first year of their degree, with preference given to students studying biological or environmental science.</p>
<p>Tess Embling was a highly respected, hardworking student who came to the University of Waikato after establishing a successful career in I.T., because she wanted to pursue her interest in nature.</p>
<p>She completed a Bachelor of Science and a Summer Research project, with the intention of doing a Masters degree.</p>
<p>“We went through our undergraduate years with Tess,” says Catherine. “We carried on to do our Masters but unfortunately she didn’t get to. When we came up with the idea for the memorial scholarship we were absolutely stoked that her family and partner were really supportive.”</p>
<p>Fiona says the scholarship is a tribute and a way to remember to Tess.</p>
<p>“She used to come top of the class all the time, not because of sheer talent, but sheer hard work.</p>

<p>“We want to encourage students who have a similar passion and drive as Tess. We hope that this scholarship reduces their financial burden so they can excel in their research.”</p>
<p>Donations from the Faculty of Science and Engineering, the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences and the Vice-Chancellor, along with a successful art and bake sale have helped the duo raise enough to start the scholarship off in 2012.</p>
<p>They welcome further contributions to support this cause and hope to offer a larger award in coming years.</p>
