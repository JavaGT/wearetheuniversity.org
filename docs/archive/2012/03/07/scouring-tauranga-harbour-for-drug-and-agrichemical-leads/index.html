<p><strong>Waikato student scouring Tauranga harbour for drug and agrichemical leads</strong></p>
<p>A University of Waikato student is creating an inventory and repository of marine organisms in Tauranga Harbour to see if there are potential cancer-or PSA-beating compounds in Bay of Plenty waters.</p>
<p>Summer Research Scholarship student Nikki Webb has been creating an inventory and a bio-resource repository of Tauranga harbour marine life, checking those organisms for potential drug and agrichemical leads.</p>
<p>Webb’s research is part of a bigger study by The University of Waikato’s Chair in Coastal Science Professor Chris Battershill looking the biochemical machinery of marine organisms, to generate bio-medicinal and agrichemical leads.</p>
<p>New Zealand is internationally recognised as being one of the top source countries for bio-discovery leads with a drug licensed for breast cancer in late 2010 and three other compounds currently in late phase clinical trials.</p>
<p>Webb has been working with the university’s Environmental Research Institute to make the inventory.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have a look at some extractions of these organisms and see if they have any bioactive properties which could then hopefully evolve to be anti-cancer drugs or PSA or other agrichemicals.”</p>
<p>To date, Webb has collected algae species, sea weed, sea sponges, sea squirts and other samples of marine life samples from Leisure Island, Waikareao Estuary and Rabbit Island.</p>
<p>Once the inventory is complete it will be available for educational purposes in museums around New Zealand.</p>
<p>As well as creating an inventory, Webb has been looking into bio-discovery laws to see what can and cannot be taken for scientific research.</p>
<p>“I’ve found that there are no comprehensive bio-discovery laws for New Zealand to date, but the Ministry of Economic Development is working on one at the moment.</p>
<p>“The ministry is working with the Waitangi Tribunal and the Convention of Biological Diversity - an international cooperation which helps with bio-discovery laws around the world – and they’re hoping to make an appropriate law for bio-discovery in New Zealand.”</p>
