<p><strong>Tuesday, 6 March 2012, 10:01 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_Students_Association">Auckland University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Auckland students support the wharfies</strong></p>
<p>In a unanimous decision at an executive meeting tonight, the Auckland University Students’ Association has voted to support the Maritime Union of New Zealand in its dispute with the Ports of Auckland. The move confirmed a motion from the Student Forum, a meeting of the University of Auckland student body at large.</p>
<p>“What we’re seeing at the Ports of Auckland is a clear step towards the casualisation of work in New Zealand,” said Ryan Abbot, Chair of the Student Forum. “Students came to a forum in the Quad at the University to voice their support for certainty in employment and fair work conditions.”</p>
<p>Arena Williams, President of the Auckland University Students’ Association, said that some students would be critical of a pro-union stance, but that the executive had debated the issue at length and come to a consensus.</p>
<p>“Today’s students will be entering the workforce soon and deserve the fair working conditions that kiwis have enjoyed for generations. This dispute could set the scene for employment relations for the next ten years, and it’s important that students discuss and get involved in the issue,” she said.</p>
<p>Auckland University Students’ Association encourages students to attend the next Student Forum in the University Quad at 1pm on Wednesday 7 March to discuss the issue further. Association Executive members will attend the Maritime Union rally on Saturday 10 March to show their support for the wharfies.</p>
