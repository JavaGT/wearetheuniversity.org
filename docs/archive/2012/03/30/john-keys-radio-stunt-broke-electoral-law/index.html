<p><strong>John Key’s radio stunt broke electoral law</strong></p>
<p>Labour acknowledges the police decision not to lay charges against RadioLive for the Prime Minister’s pre-election radio stunt but we continue to agree with the Electoral Commission that the programme broke electoral law, says Labour’s Deputy Leader Grant Robertson.</p>
<p>“Regardless of the decision by police today, the fact remains that John Key got free publicity, potentially worth tens of thousands of dollars, when he was gifted the right to host a radio show during the run-up to the election.</p>
<p>“The police note that RadioLive made an effort to comply with the Electoral Commission’s advice to take extreme care. But that same Electoral Commission found that the programme breached electoral law.</p>
<p>“John Key could not resist the opportunity to promote himself and his friendships with celebrities before the election. It was a political stunt and he should have taken responsibility for that,” said Grant Robertson.</p>
