<p>Stand Up Media Release</p>

<p><strong>Government Takes A Knife To Youth Income In Youth Week</strong></p>
<p>The youth union movement, Stand Up, which represents young union members is dumbfounded at the Government’s decision to pick on young low paid workers and students as a means to fill the hole in the Government’s books, created by fiscally irresponsible tax cuts from 2010.</p>
<p>Stand Up Spokesperson James Sleep says the Government’s Budget delivers a raw deal for young workers and students during Youth Week, a week the country is supposed to be celebrating young New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“This is the week the Government should be celebrating young New Zealanders; however the message the Government has sent is that young people will be better off across the ditch”.</p>
<p>Sleep says yesterday’s Budget has left young workers hundreds of dollars out of pocket each year and students and graduates in a worse financial situation, with fewer pathways to achieve their aspirations.</p>
<p>“Young workers are some of our country’s most vulnerable workers. Young people delivering papers as contractors don’t always get a minimum wage and can earn as little as $3 per hour. Taking $14 million away from this group will impact more on these young people and their families, than the Government’s deficit.”</p>
<p>Stand Up says the Budget has also failed to adequately resource the fight against youth unemployment.</p>
<p>“We commend the Government for allocating 3000 more placements for Youth Guarantee, however this simply doesn’t cut the mustard. The Government has cut $155 million from youth support services. This has led to the imminent closure of services that support 18 and 19 year olds into work and training.”</p>
<p>“At a time when youth unemployment is high cutting back on services is the worst response”.</p>
