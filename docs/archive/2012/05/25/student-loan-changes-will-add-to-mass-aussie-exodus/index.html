<p><strong>Student Loan Changes Will Add To Mass Aussie Exodus</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First says the Government ditching its own student loan repayment bonus scheme introduced just two years ago is symptomatic of an economy that has come off the rails.</p>
<p>Associate Finance spokesperson Andrew Williams says repealing the loan bonus scheme sends a grim message to tertiary students.</p>
<p>“Students are being told that they will not be rewarded by staying in this country and paying off their student loans early.</p>
<p>“No wonder students are marching in the streets showing their frustration at the poor direction of this Government.”</p>
<p>Mr Williams says students will continue to desert the country in droves unless they have an incentive to repay their loans.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First would introduce a scheme in which the Government matches each dollar repaid by students.</p>
<p>“The programme would more than pay for itself as students would work and pay tax in New Zealand.”</p>
