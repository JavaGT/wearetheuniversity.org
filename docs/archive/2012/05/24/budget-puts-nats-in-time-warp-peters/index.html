<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters<br>New Zealand First Leader<br>24 May 2012</p>
<p>‘Back to the Future’ Budget Puts Nats in Time Warp – Peters</p>
<p>New Zealand First has described the Budget as a leap ‘Back to the Future’ with a mean spirited and nasty approach.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters says the government is caught in a time warp, selling assets, making more public service cuts, ignoring exporters and manufacturers and heaping more misery on struggling New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“The government ignores the tax free status of the very rich and has resorted to taxing children for the pittance they earn for pocket money.</p>
<p>“This is the work of a fiscal fiend!</p>
<p>Mr Peters says the Budget neglects the fundamental requirements for manufacturers and exporters to prosper and develop the economy.</p>
<p>“It will see New Zealand slide backwards at an alarming rate as jobs disappear along with our manufacturing and exporting base.</p>
<p>“Instead of providing a brighter future as promised, this Budget has doomed the next generation of Kiwi workers to join the 1000-plus a week packing their bags for Australia.</p>
<p>“Those that remain will join thousands of other job seekers scratching around looking for poorly paid work in a ‘burger-flipping’, ‘supermarket shelf stacking’ economy.</p>
<p>“The debts and deficits-focused Budget does nothing to address the growing gap between the rich and poor.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says the outcome of National’s policies in the 1990s was disaster and the outcome will be no different this time.</p>
