<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters</p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>24 May 2012</p>
<p>Budget debate 2012 – Rt Hon Winston Peters</p>
<p>“Back to the Future”</p>
<p>This is a ‘Back to the Future’ Budget. The National Party is caught in a twenty year old time warp.</p>
<p>In July 1991 Ruth Richardson stood in this House and delivered “the Mother of all Budgets”.</p>
<p>It created hardship, misery, thousands lost their jobs. State assets were sold – large chunks of the country were flogged off overseas.</p>
<p>Remember these quotes from her speech in this House twenty years ago.</p>
<p>Remember how National was going to solve all New Zealand’s economic woes and create a better future for all of us?</p>
<p>This is what National said.</p>
<p>On the state of the New Zealand economy in July 1991:</p>
<p>“For too long we have struggled in a trap of economic stagnation and rising debt. No economic growth. Rising unemployment. And a huge overseas debt.”</p>
<p>On New Zealand’s external debt:</p>
<p>“We now owe more to foreigners, relative to the size of our economy, than almost any other country of our kind”</p>
<p>On National’s vision for New Zealand in the 1990s:</p>
<p>“A society where the disadvantaged have access to high-quality social services”</p>
<p>“A society where workplaces are creative and dynamic”</p>
<p>“A society that is prosperous, confident and paying its way in the world”</p>
<p>“… to transform New Zealand from a declining, debt-ridden country into a dynamic, enterprising and prosperous nation”</p>

<p>On asset sales:</p>
<p>“These sales are designed to free the assets for more effective and competitive private sector management… The whole economy will benefit.”</p>
<p>On New Zealand’s fiscal position in 1991:</p>
<p>“The improved fiscal position has resulted in major improvement in the outlook for public sector debt.”</p>
<p>And from that mother of all budgets came the glimmer of an idea for Ruth’s less than gifted colleague.</p>
<p>A young Bill English – who not only listened to that speech in this House.</p>
<p>He actually believed it!</p>
<p>I can recall arguing with the National Party back then about their economic policy.</p>
<p>Bill English said to me “so what are you going to say Winston when it all works out?”</p>
<p>And my reply “what are you going to say when it doesn’t?”</p>
<p>And today – in a sincere tribute to Ruth – Bill has decided to reproduce her 1991 Budget.</p>
<p>What an act of political courage! What vision, what insight!</p>
<p>This Budget shows that National has learned absolutely nothing in the last 21 years.</p>
<p>We hear the same old rhetoric – the same old excuses, the same old - same old.</p>
<p>To be fair though –</p>
<p>· It is a great Budget – if you are not a pensioner with a big power bill. Last year 30,000 households had their power cut off because they could not pay their power bills.</p>
<p>· It is a great Budget – if you are not an exporter trying to sell goods overseas with a dollar that’s out of control and without government support.</p>
<p>· It’s a great Budget – if you don’t have a student loan.</p>
<p>· It’s a wonderful Budget – if you are not a mother or father with children to feed and educate.</p>
<p>· It’s a wonderful budget for workers undecided about heading to Australia.</p>
<p>· It’s a great Budget – for Australian employment agencies.</p>
<p>· It’s a great Budget – if you are not an elderly New Zealander with your grandchildren living overseas and you are lucky to see them once a year.</p>
<p>New Zealand is living through its biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression.</p>
<p>And as with last year and the year before, this Budget will simply make the situation worse.</p>
<p>The crisis was created by the financial manipulators in the United States.</p>
<p>We all know who they were.</p>
<p>One of their former employees is supposed to be running New Zealand but he’s running New Zealand into the ground.</p>
<p>This budget is the latest example of New Zealand stumbling like a punch drunk boxer from one panacea to the next.</p>
<p>The reason why National has brought in this Budget is because it has simply no ideas about how to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>Their only answer is to privatise, sell, cut back and hope</p>
<p>The very rich will not be hurt by this budget today.</p>
<p>The National Party knows how to look after its mates – just like Ruth did.</p>
<p>Remember how National was going to make New Zealand the financial capital of the world back then?</p>
<p>And three years ago John Key came up with a bright idea to do that also and then had a great idea to build a cycle track and he can’t even do that properly.</p>
<p>Every now and then a light bulb goes off in the brains of the neoliberal Neanderthals in the National Cabinet.</p>
<p>If the country’s children acted like this we’d put them all on Ritalin.</p>
<p>National is spending tens of millions of dollars dragging us into free trade agreements that makes New Zealand look like some sort of international knock shop.</p>
<p>And in the meantime the exporters, the manufacturers, the provincial engine rooms of the economy are being forgotten.</p>
<p>Every month we lose a bit more of our manufacturing base.</p>
<p>Every month another plant closes and more workers lose their jobs.</p>
<p>This happens because our currency is way overvalued.</p>
<p>It suits the speculators and the currency traders – the financiers and the overseas banks.</p>
<p>This government drools over mining in our conservation estate.</p>
<p>It gets excited about fracking for oil or drilling in a pristine ocean setting.</p>
<p>But it will do nothing to keep one factory open or help one exporter earn one more dollar or keep one more job.</p>
<p>Tough, tough times are ahead.</p>
<p>Dairy prices are falling.</p>
<p>We are staring down the barrel of really hard times.</p>
<p>The real people in Heartland New Zealand did not create these problems but this government is going to make them pay for it.</p>
<p>Advanced economies such as Singapore, Sweden, Germany, Norway have two things in common.</p>
<p>They all have high savings rates, much greater than 10% of GDP, and they all have great manufacturing bases of over 25% of GDP.</p>
<p>We once were like that with a savings rate well over 14%, now seriously in minus figures and our manufacturing percentage of GDP has fallen from 30% to 13%.</p>
<p>We will never get rich again without tax policies that encourage high savings, research and development, investment into productive plant assets that create high margin exports and jobs.</p>
<p>We’ll never get rich when we flog off our timber in its most raw state, without any added value.</p>
<p>We’ll never get rich with a fishing industry part-owned by the Japanese or fished with foreign rust buckets and poorly cared for kamikaze crews.</p>
<p>We’ll never get rich with the great Marlborough wine industry, again like all the others, up to 50% foreign owned.</p>
<p>We’ll never get rich with a political party - with its Klingons - who’ve learnt nothing from this disastrous experience.</p>
<p>We will never get rich if we ignore the need for new Kiwi IT industries to bloom and grow in a sympathetic tax environment that keeps them here.</p>
<p>To be fair this government does one thing really well.</p>
<p>The millions it spends on public relations spin doctors, consultants, media manipulators and navel gazers create an appearance of normality where chaos prevails.</p>
<p>They are spending $120 million on asset sales alone.</p>
<p>This is a ROTTEN budget.</p>
<p>It contains all the putrid elements of twenty years of failure.</p>
<p>It did not work in 1991/92 and it will not work twenty years later in 2012.</p>
<p>For 21 years the Minister has come to parliament – at great expense to the long suffering people of Dipton and the rest of the taxpayers – and guess what he has learned?</p>
<p>NOTHING…</p>
<p>ENDS  </p>
