<p><strong>Budget 2012: Burden not being shared out fairly</strong>  </p>
<p>Budget 2012 fails to deliver any fundamental changes to the structural problems facing the New Zealand economy while ramping up the burden on lower and middle-income New Zealanders, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>“The budget is a failure for the economy and a failure for our people. The average Kiwi will pay more to cover the Government’s economic mismanagement,” said Green Party Co-leader Russel Norman.</p>
<p>“If there is a burden to be shared, then it should be shared fairly. This Budget does not do that.</p>
<p>“This budget is full of cuts that will hit middle New Zealand in the pocket. Many Kiwis will be much worse off as a result of this budget.</p>
<p>“Budget 2012, with its mix of increased user pays charges, student allowance cuts, bigger state school class sizes and increased costs for early childhood education has simply made life a little more expensive for those least able to afford it.</p>
<p>“National has failed to rebalance the economy as it promised. It is focused on managing the finances but offers nothing by way of a plan to actually grow our economy and offer New Zealanders some hope.</p>
<p>“The National Government is more focused on political management than economic management. Budget decisions like spending on new motorways and subsiding pollution are politically motivated rather than economically motivated.</p>
<p>“Auto-enrolment in KiwiSaver has been delayed for political reasons in order to achieve a wafer thin surplus. A Government focused on acting in our economic interests would have done more to promote savings,” said Dr Norman.</p>

<p>The Green Party has previously released two reports that show that i) the Government has had to borrow an additional $2 billion to fund the tax cuts that went mainly to those on higher incomes and ii) that ordinary working families are more than $11,000 worse off this year due to cumulative Budget changes since National took office, while high income earners are much better off.</p>
<p>“Bill English once saw economic rebalancing as his number one priority. Today’s updated forecasts show the current account deficit worsening to 6.7 percent of GDP in 2016,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“Borrowing to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy was fiscally reckless. Now asset sales will leave the Government accounts permanently worse off.</p>
<p>“The Green Party has a positive alternative – a smart green economy that protects our natural capital, enhances our quality of life, and shares our prosperity fairly.”</p>
