<p>Media Release Update – 24 May 2012 – For Immediate Use</p>
<p>Students Protest happening at 1pm today.</p>
<p>The Auckland University Students&#39; Association is calling for students to protest against the expected changes in the Budget that will leave many students unable to fund their study next year.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister hasn&#39;t made it clear, but it seems that around 5000 students in the system right now will find they&#39;re unable to get student allowances to finish their degrees,&quot; said Arena Williams, President of the Auckland University Students&#39; Association.</p>
<p>The 2012 Budget will make it more difficult for students to access student allowances. The parental income threshold will be cut in real terms, and current &quot;long course&quot; exemptions to the 200-week limit on receiving the allowance will be removed. This means that students from low-income studying courses such as medicine, architecture and postgraduate courses may not be able to access financial support for the full length of their degree.</p>
<p>&quot;The system is already incredibly restrictive&quot; said AUSA Education Vice-President, Sam Bookman. &quot;To receive a full allowance of $206 per week, unless they are over 24 students have to come from a family with a combined income of less than $55,000 per year. The pre-budget announcement indicates that low-income students who want to study in these prestigious courses may be forced to rethink their options. Because the pre-budget announcement did not fully disclose how the new regime will work, students have had an anxious couple of weeks to work out how the cuts will affect them.&quot;</p>

<p>In addition to the cuts to student allowances, Budget 2012 will make things harder for graduates.&quot;The government is proposing to alter pre-existing student loan contracts, to change the repayment rate from 10% to 12%. That seems like a small increase, but it hits recent graduates hard, at a time in their lives when they&#39;re not earning much and they&#39;re trying to get on to the first rungs of a tough New Zealand career ladder.&quot; Williams said. Recent studies, such as the Graduate Longitudinal Survey, have demonstrated how low graduate wages are. Adding a further 2% increase to the repayment rate will further lower take-home pay.</p>
<p>&quot;In order for students to earn a wage that will allow them to pay of their student loan and save for their future, they are bound to look offshore.&quot; noted Bookman. Last month, a record number of 4,500 New Zealanders left for Australia. &quot;Graduates will continue to flee, as they feel more and more disenfranchised in a system which doesn&#39;t value them.&quot;</p>
<p>The &#39;Blockade the Budget&#39; protest will be held at 1pm on Thursday 24 May. Hip-hop group Home Brew will perform during the protest, and MPs are invited to address the assembled students.</p>
