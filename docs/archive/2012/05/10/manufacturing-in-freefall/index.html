<p><strong>Thursday, 10 May 2012, 12:15 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>David<br>Cunliffe<br>Economic Development Spokesperson<br>10 May 2012 Media Statement</p>
<p><strong>Manufacturing In Freefall</strong></p>
<p>News today that Manufacturing index numbers have crashed nearly 6 per cent in March, is yet another sign of an economy going backwards, says Labour’s Economic Development spokesperson David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>According to Business New Zealand, the seasonally adjusted Performance of Manufacturing Index (PMI) for April was 48.0<a href="#fn1">[1]</a>. This was 5.8 points down from March, and the lowest level of activity since November 2011.<br>“Of particular concern is that the fall has been led down by lower production and new orders, and that this April decline is very large,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“Manufacturing is down drastically in regions like Otago/Southland (PMI 38.3), where just this week Steven Joyce walked away from the Dunedin Economic Development Strategy.</p>
<p>“This is on top of the Government’s decision to turn a blind eye to the disastrous consequences of closing KiwiRail’s Hillside Workshops,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“Even worse is the latest rise in the unemployment rate back up to a tragic 6.7 per cent, a huge disappointment for the thousands of families struggling to regain their dignity and a regular earned income.</p>
<p>“With a high and volatile exchange rate, continual delays in the Christchurch rebuild, and a lack of cash in the hands of ordinary New Zealanders, it is little wonder that our manufacturing sector is taking a hammering,” David Cunliffe said.</p>

<p>“All this only reconfirms what Labour has been saying: our economy is struggling to get out of the rut and the Government’s lack of a plan is not working.</p>
<p>“A ‘Zero Budget’ is what you get when you have a failing economy.<br>“Austerity economics will do nothing to help manufacturing, exporting or employment to claw its way out of the hole the New Zealand economy is in,” David Cunliffe said.</p>

<p>[1] A PMI reading above 50.0 indicates that manufacturing is generally expanding; below 50.0 that it is declining.</p>
