<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong><br>New Zealand First Leader<br>10 May 2012  </p>
<p><strong>Winston Peters Tells Aussies the GC is a Load of Rubbish</strong>  </p>
<p>New Zealand First leader Rt Hon Winston Peters has this evening told thousands of Australian radio listeners his views on controversial television show <em>The GC.</em></p>
<p>Mr Peters said earlier today this hedonistic programme should never have received state funding.</p>
<p>“Why would the Government, through NZ On Air, give $420,000 for a TV programme that shows Kiwis earning high Aussie wages while living a degenerate party lifestyle?<br>“If this is the best they can do then they need to have their heads examined.</p>
<p>“We are all sick of the chardonnay-sipping, pinky finger-pointing liberals creating this sort of rubbish with taxpayer-dollars.</p>
<p>“We need to put people on the NZ On Air board who show a bit more intelligence than those who chose to fund this brain-dead show.</p>
<p>“But maybe <em>The GC</em> is a sly National Party plot to tempt young Kiwis to Australia so they can claim to have reduced New Zealand’s shocking unemployment levels.</p>
<p>“Nothing else they’ve tried has worked, so who knows?</p>
<p>“Even the title of the show has a dual-meaning which is not just seriously repulsive to women but to all right-thinking members of society.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says the programme’s much-hyped Māori cultural content is virtually non-existent.</p>
<p>“Just showing a few scribbles on their faces is hardly going to satisfy the cultural requirement.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters was interviewed live shortly after 5pm today on Sydney radio talkback station 2GB.</p>
