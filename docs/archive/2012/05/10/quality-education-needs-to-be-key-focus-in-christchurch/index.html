<p>10 May 2012</p>
<p>For Immediate Release</p>
<p>Quality Education needs to be key focus in Christchurch</p>
<p>The NZEI Re Riu Roa says ensuring the delivery of quality education needs to be the priority in any reshaping of Christchurch’s education sector.</p>
<p>National President, Ian Leckie says it’s imperative to keep children’s education at the forefront of any changes to the way education is delivered in Christchurch.</p>
<p>Mr Leckie says the NZEI Re Riu Roa will be closely scrutinizing the Ministry of Education and Tertiary Education Commission report ‘Directions for Education Renewal in Greater Christchurch’ released today to ensure that those principles are being upheld.</p>
<p>He says fiscal and political considerations should not dominate over quality education.</p>
<p>“We want Canterbury children to have no disadvantage because of the earthquakes. This is definitely not a time for radical experiments. Instead it is an opportunity to invest wisely in education, building on the basis of what we know works best,” he says.</p>
<p>“We also want to ensure that communities are able to continue to be actively involved in their local schools – something that has underpinned our education sector successfully for many years.”</p>
