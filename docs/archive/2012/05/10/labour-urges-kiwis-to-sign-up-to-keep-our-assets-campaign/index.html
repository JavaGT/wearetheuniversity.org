<p>10 May 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>Labour urges Kiwis to sign up to Keep our Assets campaign</p>
<p>Labour Leader David Shearer is calling on New Zealanders to express their opposition to National’s plan to sell our assets by signing the petition to force a citizens initiated referendum on the issue.</p>
<p>Speaking at today’s launch of the petition, David Shearer said he was proud to work with the community groups leading the fight against asset sales, including Grey Power and the New Zealand Union of Students’ Association.</p>
<p>“It’s clear the overwhelming majority of Kiwis are against the plan to sell a stake in our power companies and Air New Zealand. National isn’t listening. Labour is. We want your voice on this very important issue to be heard.</p>
<p>“That’s why we will be gathering as many signatures as possible to get this referendum underway so that National can no longer ignore the voice of the people,” said David Shearer.</p>
<p>The petition is led by a coalition of community groups including Grey Power, the New Zealand Union of Students’ Association and political parties.</p>
<p>It asks that an indicative referendum be held on the following question: Do you support the Government selling up to 49% of Meridian Energy, Mighty River Power, Genesis Power, Solid Energy and Air New Zealand? New Zealanders can sign the petition at <a href="http://www.notyourstosell.co.nz">www.notyourstosell.co.nz</a></p>
<p>“These strategic assets are vital to our future. They return hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends to our communities. They belong to us and we must retain them for the benefit of future generations.</p>
<p>“Once they’re gone, they are gone for good. It simply won’t be feasible to try and buy them back. That’s why we must intervene and stop National now.</p>
<p>“Labour will stand up for New Zealanders and make sure that we keep our assets and our future in Kiwi hands,” said David Shearer.</p>
