<p><strong>Family of five making a splash at Victoria</strong></p>
<p>National water polo representative Eamon Lui-Fakaotimanava completed a full family circle of Victoria University graduates when his Bachelor of Commerce and Administration degree was conferred yesterday.</p>
<p>Eamon’s sister Ciara graduated from Victoria in 2007, his brother Conor graduated in 2010, and parents Holona and Trish met while studying at Victoria University in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Eamon deferred graduation twice to represent New Zealand in the national men&#39;s water polo team, which included playing at the World FINA Water Polo League in China and Japan.</p>
<p>“Throughout my studies, sport played a huge role in my life. Balancing both sport and study helped me build the skills necessary to succeed.</p>
<p>“I am very lucky to have a great crew around me—my family and friends have always supported me in my studies and sporting aspirations,” says Eamon.</p>
<p>Currently working as an Analyst in consulting at Deloitte, Eamon hopes to establish a career in management consulting while maintaining an interest in the public sector and education, to help improve the lives of Pacific people in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The driving force behind my education has always been my family, especially my parents,” says Eamon. “They have always encouraged us to strive for excellence and I can’t thank them enough for their support over the years.”</p>
<p>In 2007 Eamon and Conor, who also plays for the New Zealand Men&#39;s water polo team, won Victoria University Blues Awards—the highest recognition for sportspeople, who by their sporting achievements or contribution to sport, brought credit to Victoria</p>
