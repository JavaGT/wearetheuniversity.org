<p>Half of New Zealanders know poverty first hand</p>
<p>New Zealand needs a major re-think of what is a liveable family income, as a new study reveals half of all households are likely to have spent time in poverty, the Green Party says.</p>
<p>An Otago University study the ‘Dynamics of Income and Deprivation, looked at incomes over a seven-year period and found that poverty was much more prevalent than the traditional “snap shot” view normally reveals.</p>
<p>“It shows that half of all New Zealanders are likely to know first-hand what it means to struggle to get by,” Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said.</p>
<p>“It also reveals a disturbing percentage of households – 12 per cent - are likely to have visited a food bank or received money or clothes from a community organisation.</p>
<p>“For households with children, or who are Maori, the situation is even worse,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
<p>“This study focussed on the years 2002 to 2009 when Labour was mainly in Government. But tax cuts for the rich, and a range of attacks on families under National, will only have widened the gap between the haves and the have nots.</p>
<p>“This shows that both National and Labour have failed to meet the needs of a huge portion of New Zealand families.”</p>
<p>The Green Party believes its time for real costings into what families actually need to earn to run a household in a way that enables people to not just survive, but participate fully in society, Mrs Turei said.</p>
<p>“The Government’s wave of attacks on young families - as it hikes student loan repayments, shaves $200 million from part of the welfare system - is going to make things worse for our most vulnerable families.”</p>

<p>The Green Party would reduce pressure on families by creating a strategy to tackle inequality based on what it really costs to run a household.</p>
<p>We have a plan to see all families in quality, stable housing.</p>
<p>Families need a progressive tax system, progressive student loan repayments and an increase in the minimum wage.</p>
<p>The Green Party would also extend Working for Families tax credits to benefit all children – including those whose parents are on the benefit.</p>
<p>“My member’s bill, which achieves that for beneficiary children, will be put into the ballot tomorrow.” Mrs Turei said.</p>
