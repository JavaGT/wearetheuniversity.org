<p>9 May 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>Pasifika education given short shrift</p>
<p>Giving children the resources to learn a second language is something most parents applaud, yet opportunities for Pasifika children are being stymied by the National-led Government, says Labour’s Pacific Island Affairs spokesperson Su’a William Sio.</p>
<p>“Not many would argue that speaking another language is good for a child’s education.</p>
<p>“Yet Pasifika children have today been given a short-shrift by National members of Parliament’s Education &amp; Science Select Committee when they voted down a request to look into the academic benefits of Pacific Bilingual education.</p>
<p>“We are a Pacific nation. The number of Pasifika children in our schools increased 33 per cent over the past decade, and yet this government refuses see the benefits of Pacific bilingual education.</p>
<p>“We teach Japanese, Spanish and French in our schools, yet place less importance on Pacific languages.</p>
<p>“Labour’s inquiry sought to establish the facts by looking to measures which could significantly raise Pacific academic achievement.</p>
<p>“The Government’s refusal to give this issue a fair hearing is telling. The alternative- an inquiry into the Pacific language in early childhood education – will go ahead instead with Labour’s support, but is much too narrow in scope.</p>
<p>“I encourage parents, teachers and researchers who feel strongly about Pacific bilingual education to make a submission to the committee on the subject. Public submissions will close on 25 June.</p>
<p>“Labour has a comprehensive education policy for Pasifika students, which includes restoring the Pacifika Education Plan (PEP) and the Tupu and Folauga educational resources.</p>
<p>“The Government must invest in the futures of Pacific people in Aotearoa. Bilingualism is a strength that should be embraced and not discouraged,” Su’a William Sio said.</p>
