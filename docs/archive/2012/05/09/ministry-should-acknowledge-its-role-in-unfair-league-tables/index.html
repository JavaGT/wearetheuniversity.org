<p><strong>Wednesday, 9 May 2012, 4:14 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZEI">NZEI</a></strong></p>
<p>9 May 2012</p>
<p>For Immediate Release</p>
<p>Ministry of Education should acknowledge its role in unfair League Tables</p>
<p>The publication of school performance data based on national standards is both unfair and reckless, says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President Ian Leckie.</p>
<p>Mr Leckie says the Ministry of Education should accept its share of responsibility for the way the information will be used once it is made public.</p>
<p>“Clearly that information, once released, will be used to compare one school with another and the Ministry is being irresponsible and reckless in trying to dodge its role in that outcome.”</p>
<p>“The Minister of Education Hekia Parata has said she does not support performance data being turned into league tables but if the Ministry releases the information then that is exactly what will happen.”</p>
<p>“We know national standards are unfair and unreliable. They do not give an accurate indication of how well a student, a teacher, or a school is performing. In fact, we know they are totally misleading.”</p>
<p>“We would urge parents to take a close look at their children’s schools, assess how that school meets their own children’s needs and not be persuaded by the erroneous, unfair and inaccurate information that they will soon be seeing in published league tables in the media,” he says.<br>ends</p>
