<p>4 May 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>No OSCAR for Government’s latest performance</p>
<p>Allowing one of the key supports for out of school care providers sink into oblivion once again highlights the government’s on-going ambivalence towards children, Labour&#39;s spokesperson for Social Development and Children Jacinda Ardern and its Education spokesperson, Nanaia Mahuta, say</p>
<p>The MPs comment follows the announcement that the OSCAR (Out of School Care and Recreation) Foundation’s current financial situation means it has not only had to cancel its annual conference this weekend, but is also looking to close its doors permanently.</p>
<p>&quot;The OSCAR foundation, an umbrella organisation for thousands of after school care providers and programmes that exist across the country, has operated since 1995,” Nanaia Mahuta said.</p>
<p>“It has provided guidance, advocacy and advice for those working with our most vulnerable -a critical role given the speed in which this sector has grown, the increased reliance on these services by parents, and the need for quality assurances and standards. The foundation essentially ensures that programmes are run effectively and with the children’s needs uppermost.</p>
<p>“In many communities OSCAR is an extension of school where children can learn, socialise with peers, do homework and play – all essential additions to positive learning.</p>
<p>“For Labour, before and after school care like that provided by OSCAR, is a cross-cutting issue that engages young people in a positive learning environment and many communities rely on these initiatives to meet the needs of children and parents with work responsibilities,” Nanaia Mahuta said.</p>

<p>Jacinda Ardern questioned the rationale for the massive upheaval and said she was concerned at the impact it would have.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister will no doubt claim that the Foundation’s funding will be ‘redistributed’ to the frontline, but have the people at the coalface even had a chance to share their views on the loss of this service, and the subsequent effect it will have?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Government currently has the role of checking that after school programmes are up to scratch, but some of them haven&#39;t had any contact from the Department for almost seven years, some have just had a phone call to &#39;check&#39; on their programme, while other have had no contact whatsoever,” Jacinda Ardern said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry of Social Development must acknowledge that the OSCAR Foundation has played a big part in establishing standards and quality, a role that could be lost if the Foundation is left to collapse.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever the reason for this current situation, the Government must prove it has a commitment to this important and growing sector without sacrificing quality along the way,” said Jacinda Ardern.<br>ends</p>
