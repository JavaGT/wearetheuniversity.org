<p><strong>Professor Sir Mason Durie To Retire</strong></p>
<p>Massey University Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Mäori and Pasifika) Professor Sir Mason Durie will retire from his current positions next month.</p>
<p>Sir Mason (Rangitäne, Ngäti Kauwhata, Ngäti Raukawa) joined Massey in 1988, established the School of Maori studies, Te Pütahi-a-Toi, and was head of school for 14 years before being appointed Massey&#39;s first Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Mäori) in late 2002, a role that was later expanded to include Pasifika. He has been Deputy Vice-Chancellor since 2009.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says Sir Mason provides superb leadership and has made numerous valuable contributions both internally and externally. He was successful in gaining funding to establish a Centre for Mäori Health Research, Te Pümanawa Hauora, and also negotiated the Mäori mental health programme, Te Rau Puawai, which provides up to 100 scholarships a year for students studying health-related subjects. Most recently he has led the work on establishing the planned new College of Health and has agreed to take on a role in the college at a later date.</p>
<p>The process to appoint a replacement for Sir Mason will be conducted over the next two months.</p>
