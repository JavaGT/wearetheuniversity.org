<p>I May 2012</p>
<p>For Immediate Release</p>
<p>Science squeezed out by focus on national standards</p>
<p>The education sector union, NZEI Te Riu Roa says it’s not surprising that less than a third of schools have been found to have effective science programmes for Year 5 to 8 students.</p>
<p>National President Ian Leckie says the focus on national literacy and numeracy standards has narrowed the curriculum and taken emphasis away from the school science programme.”</p>
<p>“Three years ago, this is exactly what we said would happen,” says Mr Leckie.</p>
<p>“Science is an area of the curriculum that is constantly evolving and changing and it is important that teachers are able to be supported and allowed to develop professionally.”</p>
<p>“It is interesting that the ERO report focused on the limited opportunities for high quality professional development in science and advised that more support was needed for teachers and principals in this area.”</p>
<p>“No one in the teaching profession will be surprised by that.”</p>
<p>He says it’s ironic that this comes after the Government removed the funding for Science Advisors – a group set up specifically to support science teaching and teachers’ professional development.”</p>
<p>“You can’t have it both ways. Removing funding and support for teacher science development and changing the focus to the discredited national standards means other areas of the curriculum were going to suffer.”</p>
