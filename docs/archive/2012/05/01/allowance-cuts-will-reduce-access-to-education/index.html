<p><strong>Allowance Cuts Will Reduce Access to Education</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand should be encouraging students into tertiary education, not preventing them from studying by forcing them into debt to survive, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce has indicated that student allowance eligibility will be cut in the Budget.</p>
<p>“By restricting access to student allowances, the Government will restrict access to tertiary education,” Green Party Students Spokesperson Holly Walker said.</p>
<p>“We know low income groups are already put off by the high cost of education. The prospect of having to borrow money to live will see more people giving up on a tertiary education.</p>
<p>“That sounds like a dimmer, rather than brighter, future to me.”</p>
<p>Students are the only group who are routinely expected to borrow money to cover their living costs and the result is over $12 billion in debt.</p>
<p>“John Key has said he wants to ‘reign in’ the student loan scheme in a ‘big way’ but by cutting back on eligibility for a student allowance he’s likely to force more students to borrow under the scheme,” Ms Walker said.</p>
<p>Mr Joyce has been reported as saying the Government can’t sustain the rising costs of student allowances.</p>
<p>He has already frozen the parental income threshold which means students who used to be eligible for an allowance no longer qualify.</p>
<p>“The Green Party sees education as an investment in the future of the country.</p>
<p>“Mr Joyce is using the economic climate as a reason for cutting access to education, when this is the perfect time to have an open, accessible tertiary education system that encourages more New Zealanders to up skill and retrain.”</p>
