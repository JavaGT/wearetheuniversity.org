<p><strong>Massey iPhone ad a first for New Zealand TV</strong></p>
<p>Massey University is taking a novel approach in its new television advertisement, to be screened for the first time on Sunday.</p>
<p>The 30-second commercial was shot on an iPhone by the University’s Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey. The Commercial Approvals Bureau has confirmed that it is the first time a New Zealand television advertisement has been filmed on an iPhone.</p>
<p>“We wanted to tell the story of Massey in a different way to reflect Massey’s innovative and creative approach to doing things,” says the University’s Associate Vice-Chancellor External Relations Cas Carter. “So we asked our Vice Chancellor if he’d film himself using one of our alumni’s products – the iPhone.”</p>
<p>In the commercial, Mr Maharey illustrates the story of Massey University by filming himself talking about innovative products developed by University staff and alumni that are changing the lives of people in New Zealand and around the world. Included are: a Massey design graduate who helped develop the iPhone; a business graduate behind the international cosmetics company Trilogy; robotic technology used for pollinating and picking apples and other fruit; and the making of food incorporating Omega 3 fish oils to increase nutritional value.</p>
<p>“We chose examples that show how we continue to shape New Zealand through our research and teaching. Our research tells us that Massey appeals to brainy, practical people who want to make a difference. We describe ourselves as ‘the engine of the new New Zealand’ because that expresses how University staff and students are contributing to the future of New Zealand, whether it’s in food technology, design, business innovation, engineering or other areas of specialisation,” Cas Carter says.</p>

<p>While he is accustomed to public appearances and being in front of the media, the filming of the commercial was challenging for the University’s Vice-Chancellor who had to do his own camera work. “We thought who better to tell the story of Massey than the man in charge of our University. After he agreed, we broke the news to him that he had to film himself while juggling roses, fruit and doughnuts,” Ms Carter says.</p>
<p>Ms Carter says Massey is continually thinking creatively about how it gets its message out to prospective students and research partners. The University has just devised the Career Engine (<a href="http://www.engine.ac.nz/career-engine">www.engine.ac.nz/career-engine</a>) for secondary school students, which is an on-line tool, linked to social media, which guides young people through to a career based on their interests including advice on school subject choices and university qualifications.</p>
<p>Massey will also be releasing a short video clip about the making of its new television advertisement. This was shot on an iPhone by Dr Max Schleser, Subject Director, Digital Media at Massey’s Institute of Communication Design. Dr Schleser is a pioneer and leading practitioner of mobile phone film-making. His feature film, <em>Max with a Keitai</em>, was one of the first to be filmed using mobile phone cameras, and he has worked on mobile media consultancy projects for Nokia. At Massey, his research projects include <em>24 Frames, 24 Hours</em> (<a href="http://www.24frames24hours.org">www.24frames24hours.org</a>), an international collaboration which to date has attracted submissions from over 100 mobile phone film-makers who have participated in online workshops with Dr Schleser.</p>
<p>Massey University is co-funder of the Mobile Innovation Network Aotearoa, a local digital media network with global reach, <a href="http://www.mina.pro">www.mina.pro</a></p>
