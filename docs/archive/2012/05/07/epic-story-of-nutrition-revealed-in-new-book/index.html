<p><strong>Epic Story of Nutrition Revealed in New Book</strong></p>
<p>Why we eat what we eat is a complicated subject. It’s something Massey University nutritional ecologist Professor David Raubenheimer has spent many years researching, doing nutritional analyses of the feeding habits of everything from snapper and snow leopards to gannets, gorillas and humans.</p>
<p>The epic story of what determines dietary behaviour is told in a new book he co-authored with Australian professor Stephen Simpson, titled _The Nature of Nutrition: A Unifying Framework from Animal Adaptation to Human Obesity (_Princeton University Press).</p>
<p>The book is the first to explore nutrition’s enormously complex role on biology, both at the level of individual organisms and in relation to their broader ecological interactions. The writers span many topics – evolution, environment, conservation and human health.</p>
<p>The basis of the book is the theoretical approach they developed in order to analyse nutrition across a vast array of species and environments. Called the Geometric Framework, the innovative tool is used in measuring, defining and understanding the links between nutrition and the biology of animals, including humans. This includes physiological mechanisms that drive the nutritional interactions of the animal with its environment, and the consequences for health, immune responses and lifespan.</p>
<p>The authors show how the Geometric Framework can be used to study and tackle a wide range of issues, from how to optimise the diets of livestock or endangered species to addressing the causes of human obesity and metabolic disease.</p>

<p>Although it doesn’t contain dietary advice, the book – according to one US reviewer – “demystifies the complexity of nutrition and diet choice and shows why people and other creatures eat the way they do.”</p>
<p>Professor Raubenheimer, featured in the <em>New Zealand Herald,</em> <em>Dominion Post</em> and <em>Manawatu Standard</em> this week as part of the University’s latest campaign highlighting its expertise in environmental science and marine research, is based at the Institute of Natural Sciences at Albany. He will be speaking at the Albany campus Open Day this Saturday.</p>
