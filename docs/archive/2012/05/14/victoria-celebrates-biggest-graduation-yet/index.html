<p><strong>Monday, 14 May 2012, 11:06 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Victoria celebrates biggest graduation yet</p>
<p>More graduands than ever before will this week celebrate successfully completing their studies at Victoria University of Wellington’s May Graduation ceremonies.</p>
<p>Thirty-two PhDs will be granted, along with 88 degrees, diplomas and certificates to 2,118 graduands.</p>
<p>Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says Victoria’s graduation ceremonies are a wonderful mix of 700-year old tradition, pageantry and spontaneous celebration with a uniquely New Zealand feel.</p>
<p>“Graduation week is a celebration of excellence, and it is my pleasure to congratulate our students on their hard work and academic success. With their diverse range of skills and attributes, our graduates make a valuable contribution to New Zealand’s economy and society, and I wish them every success for their future endeavours.”</p>
<p>One of those graduating is researcher Hayley Brown, who will receive a Doctor of Philosophy in History. Hayley examined divorce case files presented to the Wellington Supreme Court between 1898 and circa 1959 to explore the reasons behind New Zealand’s changing divorcing population.</p>
<p>Another is Lynzi Armstrong, who will receive a Doctor of Philosophy in Criminology. Lynzi researched the ways in which sex workers negotiate risk while working on the street post decriminalisation in 2003.</p>
<p>Mother and daughter duo, Senorita and Ilaise Laukau, will be graduating with Master of Education and Bachelor of Commerce &amp; Administration degrees respectively, while water polo player Eamon Lui-Fakaotimanava—who has deferred graduation twice to represent New Zealand internationally—will complete a full family circle of Victoria University graduates when his Bachelor of Commerce &amp; Administration degree is conferred.</p>

<p>Honorary degrees will also be granted to acclaimed astrophysicist Professor Warrick Couch (Doctor in Science) and well-known Wellingtonian Sir John Anderson (Doctor in Commerce).</p>
<p>The first of five ceremonies begins tomorrow at the Michael Fowler Centre at 6pm for students graduating from the Faculties of Architecture &amp; Design, Engineering and Science.</p>
<p>Parade details</p>
<p>The traditional street parades of staff and graduands will depart from the Law School in the Government Buildings Historic Reserve at noon on both Wednesday and Thursday, and will take around 30 minutes to parade along Lambton Quay and Willis and Mercer Streets to finish in Civic Square, where they will be welcomed by Mayor Celia Wade-Brown.</p>
