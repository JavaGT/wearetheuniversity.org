<p><strong>Monday, 21 May 2012, 12:50 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong><br>New Zealand First Leader<br>21 May 2012  <br> <br><strong>Government Creates ‘Lack of Grunt’ in NZ Economy – Peters</strong><br> <br>New Zealand First says this week’s slash and burn budget will rip the heart out of the country and deliver a bleak future for ordinary New Zealanders.<br> <br>Rt Hon Winston Peters told the AGM of New Zealand First’s Wairarapa branch today in Masterton that the biggest threat to our country is the lure of Australia.<br> <br>“About 1000 Kiwis a week, many of them qualified in trades, are quitting our country.<br> <br>“This loss of tradespeople is ripping the heart out of our economy and creating a serious lack of grunt for future growth.”<br> <br>Mr Peters says the blame can be put fairly on the shoulders of the unprincipled National Party.<br> <br>“This position also goes for National’s three Klingons on the political starboard bow – the Māori, United Future and ACT parties. This is politics John, but not as we know it.<br> <br>“They are selling state owned assets, privatising schools and the social welfare system, allowing prime farming land to be sold to foreigners.<br> <br>“They are letting currency speculators, financial gurus, and money jugglers get away with economic murder while ignoring the plight of ordinary New Zealanders.<br> <br>“They are failing to create jobs for thousands of graduates who head to Australia to earn higher wages to pay back enormous student loans.”<br> <br>Mr Peters says National’s dead-end policies will unfortunately gain impetus in the Budget.<br> <br>“When the economy tightens up is not the time for the Government to cut and plunder at will. That has never worked in the past and is doomed to failure.”<br> <br>ENDS</p>
