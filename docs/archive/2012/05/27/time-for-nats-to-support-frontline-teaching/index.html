<p><strong>Sunday, 27 May 2012, 1:24 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Time for Nats to Support Frontline Teaching</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First has accused the Government of wasting money marketing educational National Standards instead of helping the frontline teaching of basics such as reading, writing and numeracy.</p>
<p>Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says the Government is fighting a losing battle in trying to convince the public that cutting 1100 teachers in the Budget is in any way positive.</p>
<p>“Losing that many teachers will have an inevitable flow-on effect as more pupils are crammed into classrooms.</p>
<p>“It will make education much worse for all students whether they are currently succeeding or failing.”</p>
<p>Ms Martin says the Government has shown hypocrisy in the way it is handling teacher cuts.</p>
<p>“We have no objection to retaining current teacher-pupil ratios in Māori immersion schools but that should apply across the spectrum.</p>
<p>“There are many Māori and Pacific Island kids in State non-immersion schools and these measures will do nothing to help their academic outcomes either,” says Ms Martin.</p>
