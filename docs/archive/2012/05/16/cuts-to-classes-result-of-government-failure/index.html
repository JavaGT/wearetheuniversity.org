<p>16 May 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>Cuts to classes result of government failure</p>
<p>The Government is determined to do what’s right by Treasury rather than what’s right by our teachers and children, Labour’s Education spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta says.</p>
<p>“In her pre-Budget ‘vision’ speech today Education Minister Hekia Parata confirmed National’s policy is being driven by Treasury rather than quality evidence-based policy.</p>
<p>“How very predictable. Who would have thought that when National promised more for less it meant larger class sizes and fewer teachers?</p>
<p>“The rationale behind smaller classes is cost-savings. These cuts are a consequence of skewed priorities and National&#39;s failure to properly manage the economy or create growth,” Nanaia Mahuta said.</p>
<p>“Smaller classes will also mean that our very youngest learners risk getting lost in larger class sizes - something which has been shown to have a negative impact on their education.</p>
<p>“Studies show that smaller class sizes have the most benefit for students from disadvantaged backgrounds - the long tail of underachievement that New Zealand is meant to be addressing.</p>
<p>“It also raises questions around teacher redundancy. The estimated savings from increasing class sizes could see as many as 600 teaching positions cut.</p>
<p>“If Ms Parata is using performance pay as a covert mechanism to remove the role of the boards of trustees in appraising and assessing the quality of teachers within their own schools she should fully explain that position.</p>
<p>“What we don’t want to see is a further assault on the role of self-managing schools or arbitrary assessment of teachers’ worth,” said Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
