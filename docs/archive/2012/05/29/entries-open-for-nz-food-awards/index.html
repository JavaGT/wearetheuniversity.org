<p><strong>Entries Open for NZ Food Awards</strong></p>
<p>The quest to find New Zealand’s most innovative, creative and tasty food products is underway.</p>
<p>Organisers of the 2012 NZ Food Awards are calling for entries for this year’s event, which is now being held every year in association with Massey University.</p>
<p>Food innovators – from boutique producers to large-scale manufacturers – are invited to enter their latest, tantalising culinary creations in the awards. A range of categories is designed to cater for a variety of product entries. Winners will be selected on the basis of excellence and innovation.</p>
<p>Masterchef New Zealand’s Ray McVinnie, chief judge for the awards, says he is looking forward to baring his seasoned palate to this year’s entries.</p>
<p>“It’s always very exciting to see what new products, flavours and fresh ideas are being created. We have a lot of talent in the New Zealand food industry, particularly among some of the smaller, emerging producers who aren’t afraid to think outside the square,” he says. “I think these awards give us, the judges as well as the public, a chance to witness the collective wonders of our local food industry, which is constantly evolving.”</p>
<p>He will lead a panel of food specialists and food manufacturing industry experts to judge the awards.</p>
<p>The awards recognise creativity in product development, enterprise, food safety and packaging, with several categories in each section. The Food Enterprise section has awards for food exporters and a new category – backed by this year’s new sponsor – the Rabobank Business Innovation Award.</p>

<p>National Manager of Food and Agribusiness Banking, Hamish Midgley, says Rabobank “is proud to sponsor the NZ Food Awards. As the leading specialist food and agribusiness bank in the world, we see the recognition of excellence in food innovation and business excellence within the New Zealand food industry as a natural fit to our business.”</p>
<p>Massey University’s Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health head Professor Richard Archer encourages companies to enter and have their achievements recognised, “The food awards are a great opportunity for New Zealand food and beverage manufacturers and producers to have their products recognised for their excellence.”</p>
<p>Entries will close on Friday July 20 and judging takes place in early August at Massey University’s Albany campus. Awards will be presented at a gala dinner on Thursday September 27 at The Langham Hotel in Auckland. </p>
<p>Last year’s Supreme Award winner Geoff Matthews says winning a NZ Food Award has been “very worthwhile for our product, and even more worth it for the export market.”</p>
<p>Mr Mathews, of Mt Cook Alpine Salmon, was one of more than 100 entrants in last year’s awards. His business operates on the Tekapo Canal, a man-made channel for hydro electricity generation between Lake Tekapo and Lake Pukaki. The company’s cool chain management system keeps the fish at the optimum temperature for eating quality of between -1 degC and 1 degC from harvest until delivery. The Saikou Sushi-Grade Salmon also took top honours in the Food Operation category.</p>
<p>As last year’s chief judge Mr McVinnie said Mt Cook Alpine Salmon was “a very good quality product that has changed the world of salmon – a farmed salmon with the tastes of free-running river salmon.”</p>
<p>Mr Matthews says winning the Supreme Award has assured stakeholders they are “onto a good thing”. His product won three other awards – including the Food Safety Award – of particular benefit to the company in exporting to the United States where food safety regulations are very strict.</p>
<p>Professor Archer says New Zealand’s food and beverage industry combines excellence and originality to produce the wonderful tastes of New Zealand. “So go for it and enter your products; make sure you don’t miss out.”</p>
<p>Award winners can market their success by including the NZ Food Awards quality mark on their products.</p>
