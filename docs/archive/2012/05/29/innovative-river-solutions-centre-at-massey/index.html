<p>Innovative River Solutions Centre at Massey</p>
<p>World-class researchers from a range of environmental and agricultural sciences within Massey University will work together to provide novel solutions to current river catchment and freshwater problems.</p>
<p>The Innovative River Solutions Centre, based at the Manawatu campus, will bring together expertise from several science disciplines and information from river user and interest groups, University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says.</p>
<p>“The future of our rivers will be largely determined by how we manage them and to do this effectively we need to understand all that influences them,” Mr Maharey says. “Massey has several river experts, we’re connected to international expertise groups and we believe working with river groups is critical to the sustainable management of freshwater. It is a unique approach we are confident will provide successful solutions to current river issues. ”</p>
<p>Massey University has invested $80,000 for development of the Innovative River Solutions Centre in a project led by senior geomorphology lecturer Dr Ian Fuller. The centre will bring expertise together from disciplines including hydrology, geomorphology, ecology and soils.</p>
<p>“We want the centre to act as a hub of expertise and be informed by local knowledge and leading international science,” says Dr Fuller. “The work of the centre will benefit both keepers and users of the environment in several river catchments.”</p>
<p>The project is beginning to connect with regional councils – initially in the lower North Island – government ministries and departments and other key river groups. “We want to find out what the key problems are involving management of dynamic rivers, flood storage and management,” Dr Fuller says.</p>

<p>Massey experts will work with river stakeholders to identify issues and develop a comprehensive information hub that will guide how catchments and rivers are managed.</p>
<p>“As a regional council we take our commitment to freshwater management seriously and we welcome this initiative from Massey University which will further strengthen the knowledge and expertise in this area,” said Horizons Regional Council Chairman Bruce Gordon.</p>
<p>“Boosting the knowledge and understanding through research and monitoring will certainly support the work we do on the ground to manage our precious water resources.”<br>ends</p>
