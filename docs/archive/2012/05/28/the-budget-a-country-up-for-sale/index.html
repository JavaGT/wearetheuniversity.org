<p><strong>Monday, 28 May 2012, 12:46 pm</strong><br><strong>Speech: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Rt. Hon Winston Peters<br><strong>Leader NZ First</strong><br> <br>Address:        Public Meeting<br>                           <br>Date:              May 27 2012<br> <br>Time:              2 pm<br>                                   <br>Venue:           Senior Citizen&#39;s Hall,<br>                        55 Tawanui Rd, Kaikohe<br> <br>‘<strong>The Budget- a Country up For Sale’</strong><br> <br>The Budget this week revealed the true mentality of the individuals who now lead the National Party.<br> <br>In their first term of office they handed out huge tax cuts to the very rich.<br> <br>Remember the boss of the Westpac bank got nearly six thousand dollars a week extra in his take home pay.<br> <br>And people at the bottom of the heap got to pay higher GST on everything like their food, petrol and power bills.<br> <br>The country could not afford those tax cuts – it is going further into debt because of them so what do these financial wizards come up with?<br> <br>They’re going to ignore the profits of the very rich – the overseas banks and the rip off merchants that exploit New Zealand.<br> <br>And they are going to go after the children, the paper boys, the pamphlet deliverers, the kids who wash cars.<br> <br>Apparently these paper boys are the real tax dodgers bleeding our economy dry.<br> <br>In all my years in politics I never thought I would see the day when the nation’s children would be targeted for their pocket money by a minister of finance.<br> <br>Remember a few short years ago when it was revealed he had taken tens and tens of thousands of dollars of taxpayers’ money for living in his own house in Wellington!<br> <br>Some people appear to have forgotten that Mr English is the biggest housing beneficiary of all time in New Zealand.<br> <br>He talks about fiscal prudence – but that’s for other people. <br> <br>Those at the bottom of the heap have to be fiscally prudent.<br> <br>They have no choice.<br> <br>The Budget was also unkind to the elderly.<br> <br>It is only a matter of time before pensions are “adjusted”.<br> <br>The National Party’s cheerleaders, behind the scenes, have mounted a big campaign to get the pension age increased and the amount reduced.<br> <br>Hidden in the Budget and unannounced was a change to the asset testing when a pensioner goes into residential care.<br> <br>It is a punishment dished out to those who save for their retirement and own their own home.<br> <br>More and more pensioner homes will be sold to pay for residential care.<br> <br>And this is being done to people who have worked hard and paid their taxes all their lives.</p>

<p>The Budget did nothing for the Northland region either.<br> <br>You have heard it all before.<br> <br>About nine percent of the workforce up here in the North is unemployed – that’s according to official figures.</p>
<p>We all know that it’s much higher.<br> <br>It is a sad fact that Northland levels of poverty and health issues are the worst in the country.</p>
<p>A third of the children in the lower decile schools in Whangarei receive weekly food assistance.</p>
<p>In some cases they have to get extra food more than once a week.<br> <br>Just this week 600 people from this area signed up, at a meeting in this town Kaikohe, to look for work in Western Australia.<br> <br>What does that tell you?<br> <br>It tells us there are plenty of people here who want to work but there are not enough jobs.<br> <br>It also tells us New Zealand is being asset stripped of our greatest resource – our people.<br> <br>Teams of Australian recruitment agencies are travelling throughout New Zealand to pick up people willing to travel to the “Lucky Country”</p>
<p>We are losing people to Australia at a rate of over a thousand a week.</p>
<p>And what does Prime Minister John Key say?</p>
<p>Well, he says no worries.</p>
<p>He says “there should be no cause to worry about New Zealanders going to work in the Australian mining boom.</p>
<p>Australia contributed to 40 per cent of the economy and New Zealand wanted a strong Australia.”</p>
<p>How is that for dismissive callousness?</p>
<p>Mr Key was speaking to the TransTasman Business Circle in Auckland – some of these people have a vested interest in sucking New Zealand dry of resources and people.</p>
<p>And wait for this one – when he let slip the government’s real agenda.</p>
<p>He also said that if you were shopping for countries, New Zealand would be a good prospect.</p>
<p>He bragged - &quot;If you were really going to go out and buy a country, why wouldn&#39;t you want to buy New Zealand?</p>
<p>So there you have it.</p>
<p>An admission of what many of you have suspected.<br> <br>The leader of this country is out there selling New Zealand.<br> <br>It’s not enough to sell our power stations and our airline.<br> <br>Everything is going under the auctioneer’s hammer.<br> <br>To him this country, its resources, its people are just there to be traded like everything else he’s laid his eyes on.<br> <br>The leadership of this country has a mindset that is quite frightening.<br> <br>They have no patriotism – no love of their native land.<br> <br>They are mercenaries, ready to sell even if it is not for the highest price.<br> <br>Their idealism is buried in the ashes of the first deal they made.<br> <br>This nation was built by hard work and sacrifice.<br> <br>The speculators and wheeler dealers who arrogantly stalk the halls of power are interested only in exploiting our resources and enslaving the workers.<br> <br>It has become clear what is happening.<br> <br>It’s time for some blunt speaking about the government’s policies of exporting our professional people, our tradespeople, our skilled, our keen and enthusiastic people.<br> <br>The government is deliberately driving out of the country the middle class and trades backbone and anyone with the ability or courage to stand up against them.<br> <br>They don’t want people with steel up their backbone, they don’t want the traditionalists, the patriots, the staunch and the stable.<br> <br>They actually want to get rid of whole sections of the population.<br> <br>They want to replace them with subservient immigrants willing to work for slave wages because anything is better than where they come from.<br> <br>This fits in with their aim of a low wage, high price, economy.<br> <br>Just think about it.<br> <br>Over one thousand people leaving every week, leaving to look for a better life for their families.<br> <br>We are exporting many of our best and what are we getting in return?<br> <br>Immigration.<br> <br>What sort of immigration?<br> <br>In too many cases people without the skills of those departing.<br> <br>In too many cases people who come here for what they can get.<br> <br>Who can blame them but that does not form the basis of a sound and wise immigration policy.<br> <br>In too many cases people who come here and then bring a team of relations – especially older people who eventually get a New Zealand pension without ever contributing anything.<br> <br>In too many cases people who come from an alien culture, often complete with all their hang ups and prejudices and expecting us to conform!<br> <br>New Zealand has a reputation as a “sucker” nation.<br> <br>And the National Party’s latest threats to the pensioners of this country gives the lie to the wisdom of our Immigration Policies for the last 25 years.<br> <br>Part of the reason for this wholesale Immigration Policy was to ward off the effects of an aging population.<br> <br>It has done no such thing.<br> <br>In many cases it has added to the aging population.<br> <br>Over the years New Zealand First has had boxes and boxes of immigration scams.<br> <br>We could not keep up with them. And when we tried to do something about it many of the cases would disappear down a black hole.<br> <br>In my lifetime I have seen this country go from being one of the best places in the world to work and bring up a family to one of the worst.<br> <br>Deliberate government policies have created this low wage –high price economy.<br> <br>New Zealand wages are low.<br> <br>The cost of living is soaring.<br> <br>This winter the price of power is jumping at least ten per cent.<br> <br>Petrol prices are up and so is just about everything else.<br> <br>Northland has been seriously hurt by the policies of successive governments.<br> <br>I know about this area – I grew up here.<br> <br>When we were young we lived in a province full of energy and hope.<br> <br>There was a future for us at home.<br> <br>The future now lies across the Tasman.<br> <br>Australia is bleeding us dry.<br> <br>We raised our young people.<br> <br>We educated them. We trained them.<br> <br>We prepared them to work in New Zealand to keep building a then great country.<br> <br>Now they are pouring across the Tasman to work in Australia.<br> <br>It is a sad fact of life that the Australian government is creating more jobs for New Zealanders than the New Zealand government.<br> <br>This is an indictment on the leadership of this country.<br> <br>They are globalists – they don’t care about this country.<br> <br>It’s just a heap of resources to be plundered.<br> <br>Do not think for one moment that they care about our children and grandchildren going to live in another country.<br> <br>What about the grandparents?<br> <br>What about the family back home?<br> <br>New Zealand will end up as an economically and socially distorted society, made up of senior citizens reliant on new immigrants.<br> <br>That is the brighter future John Key promised you at the last election.<br> <br>For three years his government pretended to be reasonable – behind the smiley face.<br> <br>Now it is clear.<br> <br>The smiley face is a wolf in wolf’s clothing.<br> <br>Nothing is sacred.<br> <br>All of this Finance Minister Bill English describes as a “series of moderate and considered adjustments.</p>
<p>Everything is up for sale by this money trader and his big financial backers.<br> <br>We say enough is enough.<br> <br>The Key government did not get a mandate to chop up New Zealand and sell it.<br> <br>Make your voices heard.<br> <br>Hammer your local MP’s.<br> <br>Bomb the Beehive with your message that you want jobs and hope.<br> <br>That you want your families to live in New Zealand.<br> <br>And that you want to own your own country. <br> <br>And you want it back NOW!!!!<br> <br>And that on these critical issues: to you, to your family, to your towns and cities, and to your country, you will never ever back down.<br> <br>ENDS</p>
