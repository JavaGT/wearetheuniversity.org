<p><strong>Failed economic management drives unemployment jump</strong></p>
<p>Today’s revelation that unemployment is back up to 6.7% confirms that the Government’s approach to economic management simply isn’t working, say Labour’s Finance Spokesperson David Parker and Economic Development Spokesperson David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“Rising unemployment is joining the list of examples of this Government’s economic policy failures - along with a worsening current account deficit, growing international debt, and a growing wage gap with Australia.</p>
<p>“That’s why we will have another near-zero Budget this month and it’s why unemployment is going up when it should be recovering. Selling assets, selling farms and selling legislation is not a solution,” said David Parker.</p>
<p>David Cunliffe says National clearly does not have a workable plan for jobs and growth.</p>
<p>“National’s refusal to get seriously behind Kiwi businesses, sectors and regions is now reaping a bitter harvest with more than 160,000 New Zealanders now out of work.</p>
<p>“Poorly executed economic development is a recipe for a longer, deeper recession and growing social misery.</p>
<p>“Re-arranging the deck chairs of government departments may be a whale of a tale, but MoBIE isn’t going to help the hundreds of thousands of Kiwis that have gone on the unemployment scrapheap under National’s watch,” said David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“The Government should be very concerned with today’s unemployment statistics which show the failure of National’s management of the economy and economic development approach,” said David Parker and David Cunliffe.</p>
