<p>22 May 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>Another kick in the guts for teachers</p>
<p>The National Government’s plans to increase class sizes but freeze teacher numbers will see a shortfall of 1,000 teachers over the next four years as a result of rising school rolls, Labour’s Education spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta says.</p>
<p>“Responding to questions in the House today Education Minister Hekia Parata admitted that her move to bigger class sizes will see 1,000 fewer teachers employed than forecast under the current class size model.</p>
<p>“As school rolls continue to grow the result will be even bigger classes. More kids per class means teachers have less time to interact with students on a one to one basis and classes have the potential to be more off-task,” Nanaia Mahuta said.</p>
<p>“Teachers and principals have already indicated that increasing numbers of children are presenting with behavioural or learning challenges and larger class sizes will do nothing to alleviate difficulties likely to arise from that.</p>
<p>“Larger classes do not provide an environment conducive to good teaching no matter how qualified the teacher.</p>
<p>“The Minister needs to be honest about how this suite of changes will fundamentally change the culture of teaching. They will lead to pressure-cooker classes and stressed teachers.</p>
<p>“Parents are hugely concerned about the practical impact of larger classes especially when their children are starting out at school, yet the Minister’s new proposal will mean some of our youngest pupils - in Y2-Y4 - will be going into larger classes at the very time they need a secure and positive start.</p>
<p>“If the Prime Minister had a plan to grow the economy he’d be investing in a better education system, not freezing teacher numbers in a crude attempt to meet his 2014 Budget surplus.</p>
<p>“One thousand fewer teachers over the next four years is a symptom of a Government with no ideas,” said Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
