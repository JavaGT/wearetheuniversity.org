<p>Focus on whānau breaks AFFCO deadlock</p>
<p>The Maori Party says a focus on whānau helped to break the deadlocked AFFCO lockout, and praised the iwi leaders whose intervention has been critical to achieving a breakthrough on this issue.</p>
<p>“It is wonderful news to hear that this on-going issue has been settled at last,” said Co-Leader, Dr Pita Sharples. “The dispute at AFFCO was not only rough on the workers, it raised tensions within whanau and wider communities.”</p>
<p>“The Iwi Leadership Forum has been a key game-shifter in brokering this unique settlement between AFFCO and the Meatworkers Union. Full credit must go to Ngahiwi Tomoana, Sonny Tau and Tuku Morgan, and to Ken Mair and the negotiation team who crafted an agreement which all parties could sign up to.”</p>
<p>“60% of the Talley’s workforce is Maori, and there has been a huge effort by marae, by iwi and community groups to look after those workers and whanau affected by the lockouts in Wairoa and elsewhere. The added support of the iwi leaders group may have just been the final push needed to refocus the discussions between the two parties,” said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>Co-leader Tariana Turia said the places where these lockouts have occurred are mostly in small provincial towns, where the loss of income has far reaching impacts on every member of the community.</p>
<p>“The dawn announcement will be gratefully received by whānau throughout these communities, and it is an absolute credit to the iwi leadership that they have stood alongside their whānau in working with the union and AFFCO to move forward,” said Mrs Turia.</p>

<p>The Māori Party also acknowledged the role of the Minister of Maori Affairs, who wrote to iwi leaders asking them to intervene, and who asked Te Puni Kokiri staff to set up bases to assist those involved with the dispute.</p>
<p>“I have been particularly involved with the Rangiuru AFFCO plant in Te Puke and saw at first hand the difficulties many of our whānau were experiencing,” said Te Ururoa Flavell, MP for Waiariki. “Te Puni Kokiri staff were able to bridge the gaps between those needing help, and the government services that might be able to assist them.”</p>
<p>“Many of the thousand workers that have been locked out have been without pay since February this year and the pressure was clearly experienced across the whānau. Te Puni Kokiri has been actively involved in recent weeks, in working with our communities and trying to support them during this time of extreme hardship,” he said.</p>
