<p><strong>Pacific Island Students Failed By The Government</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is asking the Government to implement changes to the education system to help Pacific Island students get better results at school.</p>
<p>The call for change comes after the Education Review Office said yesterday that there has been little progress in improving the achievements of students from Pacific cultures.</p>
<p>Pacific Island Affairs spokesperson Asenati Lole-Taylor says the Government identified in 2009 that an urgent focus was required to lift Pacific students’ learning performance.</p>
<p>“The Government is failing Pacific Island students who will make up a significant part of the workforce in the coming years.</p>
<p>“Government inaction today will sentence a significant proportion of these students to a future of low-paid, unskilled work.</p>
<p>“Programmes introduced at individual schools that have proven to be helpful to Pacific students should be introduced by the Government to schools nationwide.”</p>
<p>Mrs Lole-Taylor says Government funding cuts to community-based groups are also playing a significant role in the under-performance of Pacific students</p>
<p>“The Government should budget adequate funding for Pacific Island community groups including those that help with education – just as they do for Māori.”</p>
