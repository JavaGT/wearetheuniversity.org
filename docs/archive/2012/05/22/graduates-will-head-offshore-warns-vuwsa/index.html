<p><strong>Graduates Will Head Offshore For A Brighter Future – Warns VUWSA</strong></p>
<p>The Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) has expressed concern at the exodus of New Zealand’s brightest young minds to Australia, as job opportunities dry up and student debt mounts at home.</p>
<p>President Bridie Hood said that unless the Government did something to keep kiwis here, the flow offshore would only grow larger.</p>
<p>“National promised in 2008 to stop the bleed of New Zealand’s brightest to Australia. The opposite has happened, and we are haemorrhaging, with our most talented graduates seeking a future offshore. With high unemployment and students being burdened with even more debt; no wonder they’re choosing Wollongong over Wellington,” said Ms Hood.</p>
<p>The latest annual figures from Statistics New Zealand shows a record 53,462 kiwis chose to leave New Zealand permanently, while unemployment remains staggeringly high at 6.7%.</p>
<p>“Although John Key might think students won’t get out of bed in the morning for much, we will to catch a flight to a brighter future across the Tasman,” said Ms Hood.</p>
<p>The Government’s changes to loans and allowances will make it harder for students and graduates to live in Aotearoa. VUWSA is encouraging students to take action by joining a protest march from Victoria’s Kelburn Campus to Parliament on Thursday, 24 May at 12:00 noon.  </p>
