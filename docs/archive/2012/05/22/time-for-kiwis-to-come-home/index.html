<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Time for Kiwis to Come Home</strong>  </p>
<p>After nine years and 19 rotations it’s time for Kiwi soldiers to wind up the Bamyan deployment and come home, Labour’s Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Phil Goff, says.<br> <br>“We can be proud of the work done by Kiwi troops serving with the Provincial Reconstruction team. We have helped to maintain a generally peaceful local environment and worked with people there on development projects.<br> <br>“Our soldiers have served professionally and shown respect and friendship towards local people who in turn have been supportive of New Zealand’s presence there,” Phil Goff said.<br> <br>“It was a big advantage for us to have worked with the administration of Governor Sarabi which has largely been honest and competent.<br> <br>“That is in huge contrast to the national administration which has been corrupt, implicated in drug trafficking and unable to win the confidence of the wider Afghan population.<br> <br>“The PRT has been a major commitment by New Zealand, with thousands of Kiwis serving in the deployment at a cost of tens of millions of dollars.<br> <br>“But the solution to the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan in the end can only be found by the people who live there. No amount of external presence can preserve a government that is incapable of securing the support of its own people.<br> <br>“Fundamental change within the current administration and dialogue with its opponents offers the best chance of securing longer term peace.<br> <br>“Without that, the future for Afghanistan looks bleak,” Phil Goff said.<br> <br>ENDS</p>
