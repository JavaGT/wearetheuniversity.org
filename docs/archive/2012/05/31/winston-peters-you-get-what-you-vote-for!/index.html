<p><strong>Thursday, 31 May 2012, 1:13 pm</strong><br><strong>Speech: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters<br>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p><strong>Address:</strong> Western Bay of Plenty Grey Power AGM<br><strong>Date:</strong> 31 May 2012<br><strong>Time:</strong> 1pm<br><strong>Venue:</strong> Wesley Church, 13th Avenue, Tauranga</p>
<p><strong>“You Get What You Vote For!”</strong></p>
<p>There is a question that should be asked at the start of this speech and that is: “How many of you voted National at the last election?”</p>
<p>Don’t be shy – have the courage of your convictions!</p>
<p>It’s important to think about how we vote and to work out what we actually vote for.</p>
<p>Now for those of you who voted National some more questions:</p>
<p>• Did you know that you were voting for tougher tax policies for paper boys, the kids who deliver pamphlets or wash your car?<br>• Did you know you were voting for increased class sizes in the schools around here?<br>• Did you know you were voting for sending a thousand New Zealanders a week to Australia?<br>• Did you know you were voting for privatising the welfare system?<br>• Did you know that you were voting for increased profits for the Australian owned banks?<br>• Did you know you were voting for the sale of the Crafar farms to China? We did warn you!<br>• Did you know that you were voting for continuing low wages for the kind people who work in the eldercare sector?</p>
<p>Don’t say that you did not know you were voting to sell our power stations and give away control of our waterways, rivers and lakes.</p>
<p>National made it clear that’s what they were going to do.</p>
<p>So if there is a feeling of guilt that you helped sell your country down the drain – and you were told it was going to happen - our advice is to learn to live with it.</p>

<p>There’s more to come.</p>
<p>You will watch your country being asset stripped over the next two years.</p>
<p>This was always going to happen when National and their cronies gained a second term.</p>
<p>Too many New Zealanders seem to suffer from a form of political sado-masochism</p>
<p>Many parts of the Western world are having big economic problems.</p>
<p>These problems were not caused by ordinary people but ordinary people are bearing the brunt of the economic pain being dished out.</p>
<p>And there is worse to come make no mistake. Just look at the eldercare sector.</p>
<p>The treatment of the rest home workers and the carers who look after the elderly in their homes is a national disgrace.</p>
<p>These dedicated people look after some of the most frail and vulnerable members of our society.</p>
<p>For a lot of people growing old is not easy. They need help with the ordinary daily tasks of life that most of us take for granted.</p>
<p>We are talking about people who need help to have a shower, cook a meal, or just do the washing.</p>
<p>And there are those in residential care – also reliant on the kindness of someone else.</p>
<p>The faceless people and their political masters who decide to reduce real funding to the eldercare sector should be made to work a month in a rest home for the minimum wage.</p>
<p>Equal Employment Opportunities Commissioner Judy McGregor who went undercover to get a picture of life working in this sector deserves a medal.</p>
<p>Her report, Caring Counts, said aged-care workers were paid too little compared with similar jobs in places such as hospitals.</p>
<p>The report recommended phasing in pay increases over three years until community-based workers are paid the same as those paid directly by district health boards.</p>
<p>So in effect a two tier system has developed between two sets of workers who do similar jobs.</p>
<p>Many receive only the minimum wage and if they have to use their own vehicles to travel to help with home care – they receive much less than that paid to others.</p>
<p>This situation should not be allowed to continue.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s time to remind you that New Zealand First increased funding for the elder care sector by more than half a billion dollars between 2005 and 2008.</p>
<p>It was a major part of our confidence and supply agreement with the Labour Party.</p>
<p>Now everything has slipped behind.</p>
<p>Costs and wages have not and are not keeping up with inflation.</p>
<p>New Zealand First is working with the eldercare sector to try to restore some sort of parity and acknowledgement of the work that’s being done.</p>
<p>The Budget was also cruel to the elderly in its treatment of the assets held by those with a family member in residential care.</p>
<p>A $10,000-a-year rise in the threshold at which asset testing kicks in has been scrapped in favour of an annual inflation adjustment instead.</p>
<p>This is a sneaky attack aimed at asset stripping the elderly.</p>
<p>The figure was set at $210,000 with an annual increase of $10,000 but that figure has been reduced to the inflation rate – a big drop in many cases and it’s much worse for retired couples than singles..</p>
<p>This is a punishment dished out to those who save for their retirement and own their own home.</p>
<p>At this stage we must point out that while the Budget was mean to the elderly and the paper boys, there is plenty for the Maori Party slush fund Whanau Ora.</p>
<p>Last Sunday we were in Kaikohe – a town in Northland – where many Maori are living in poor conditions.</p>
<p>There is very little work and there have been reliable reports that some children have been eating food scraps set aside to feed the pigs.</p>
<p>This is terrible.</p>
<p>Yet the Maori Party is throwing millions at Whanau Ora so selected Maori people can work on their “connectedness” whatever that might be.</p>
<p>The only connection needed by Maori is connection to a job – healthcare and decent housing and education.</p>
<p>Northland has high levels of unemployment .</p>
<p>Maori there are signing up in their hundreds to work in the mineral industry in Australia.</p>
<p>What does that mean to you?</p>
<p>Well it means to me that they are willing to work but there are no jobs.</p>
<p>The lack of work and the loss of opportunity in this country is driving thousands of Kiwis across the Tasman.</p>
<p>When John Key promised pay parity with Australians he was careful not to explain that to get pay parity, New Zealanders actually had to go and work across the ditch.</p>
<p>More than 400,000 have already gone and if the current exodus continues there’ll be a million of us there in ten years.</p>
<p>These are the people we cannot afford to lose.</p>
<p>They are our tradespeople, our IT specialists, our professionals and those with a bit of grunt.</p>
<p>We need them to help pull us out of the mire.</p>
<p>Instead, as one planeload of Kiwis heads out, a planeload of immigrants comes in as part of some sort of twisted repopulation policy.</p>
<p>New immigrants are prepared to work long hours for low wages.</p>
<p>That’s because they will do anything to get away from the conditions in the places they come from.</p>
<p>New Zealand First – contrary to some reports – is not anti-immigrant.</p>
<p>If we have a genuine shortage of a skill in specific area there is no reason not to use someone overseas with specific skills.</p>
<p>But this should not be used as an excuse to avoid training our own people.</p>
<p>Now – some matters for GreyPower members.</p>
<p>As promised last year New Zealand First is trying to get SuperGold Cardholders a ten per cent winter power discount.</p>
<p>We tried to get it in the Budget but it was rejected out of hand by the prime minister.</p>
<p>As you are only too well aware - all power companies are increasing their electricity prices.</p>
<p>Our plan is to get state-owned power companies to invoke the social responsibility clause in the SOE Act to get about $100 off your winter power bill.</p>
<p>Under our scheme the cheaper electricity would be supplied by the three State Owned Enterprise-power generators - Might River Power, Meridian and Genesis.</p>
<p>The cost of the discount scheme to the highly profitable state-owned power companies would be about $34 million a year but these companies would benefit from a larger customer base.</p>
<p>We had everything ready – the research papers – the legislation – we were ready to go but John Key would not even talk to us about it.</p>
<p>We are undaunted – and will be putting forward a private members bill to try to shame the government doing something to help seniors..</p>
<p>We are also making good progress designing a scheme to bring more health benefits to SuperGold card holders.</p>
<p>We are doing the maths and finding some startling results.</p>
<p>Working on one free doctors’ visit and five consultations capped at ten dollars a visit, the annual cost is about 90 million dollars.</p>
<p>As you know prevention is the best part of cure.</p>
<p>If one of you chooses not go to the doctor with a throat infection because of the cost and you end up in hospital with pneumonia, it will cost about $1200 a day on average.</p>
<p>In two weeks that cost is almost $17,000.</p>
<p>So if you take into account the cost of a long hospital stay and the long term cost of care afterwards, our plan will actually save money.</p>
<p>New Zealand First wants this health check system for all people with a SuperGold Card.</p>
<p>We are preparing legislation for this as well as the power scheme.</p>
<p>During this term of Parliament New Zealand First deliberately went into Opposition.</p>
<p>We made that very clear during the election campaign.</p>
<p>Now that we are back in Parliament there are some things we don’t like – that have changed over the three years between 2008 and 2011.</p>
<p>The people who run Parliament are trying to make it run like some government department.</p>
<p>Winston Churchill – that great defender of democracy – pointed out that democracy was a very untidy form of government, except no one had thought of a better system.</p>
<p>Somehow, someone over the past three years has tried to “tidy up democracy” in New Zealand according to their version of how it should operate..</p>
<p>They forgot that parliament is a House of Representatives of the people.</p>
<p>Have any of you ever served on a committee of an organisation?</p>
<p>Have you ever been a member of a sports club working bee?</p>
<p>Just imagine a group of committees – totalling 121 people – sitting around discussing something.</p>
<p>Naturally it’s a bit untidy – especially when people have strong opinions on issues and are prepared to voice these strongly.</p>
<p>Democracy is stronger when dissenting voices are allowed to voice their dissent.</p>
<p>A government is only as good or bad as the opposition allows.</p>
<p>We would prefer a more flexible approach in parliament to allow a better flow of ideas.</p>
<p>We would also prefer the prime minister and his ministers to spend more time in the House and take more of an active part in proceedings.</p>
<p>As it is they pop down for question time three days a week when parliament is sitting except the PM only turns up twice a week, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.</p>
<p>This is what the Prime Minister said yesterday in response to a question from an MP.</p>
<p>“None of the above. Someone who has to come to the House on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and answer questions from buffoons like him.”</p>
<p>Does that sound like arrogance to you?</p>
<p>It’s surely not too much to ask him to spend more than two and a half hours a week on democracy.</p>
<p>But that is what you get when you vote for National!</p>
