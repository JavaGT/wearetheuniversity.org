<p><strong>Thursday, 31 May 2012, 12:03 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>University Council Decision On Change Proposals</strong></p>
<p>This afternoon the University of Canterbury Council decided that UC would discontinue its American Studies programme and a number of courses in Management Sciences focused on Operations Research with the potential for disestablishment of up to six roles.</p>
<p>This followed significant periods of consultation (eight weeks for the College of Arts programmes) during which the University received a number of internal and external submissions including a petition, held staff and student fora, provided opportunities to meet with students individually and in groups, and held a special meeting of the Academic Board to formulate its advice to Council. Another subcommittee of Council, the Finance, Planning and Resources Committee, was given access to all the submissions, minutes and proposals so that it might also formulate advice.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor, Dr Rod Carr, says: &quot;Today&#39;s decision has not been taken lightly by Council, which appreciates that it will be upsetting for staff and students in these areas.</p>
<p>&quot;The University will immediately begin organising one-on-one meetings with academic advisors for students currently enrolled in Management Sciences and American Studies, so they can discuss their options in light of today&#39;s decision. The University will immediately stop accepting enrolments from students new to these programmes.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be supporting staff in these areas and also talking with them about how the University might be able to help their students complete their current courses of study.”</p>
