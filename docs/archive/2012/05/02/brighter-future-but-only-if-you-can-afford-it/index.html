<p><strong>Brighter Future, But Only If You Can Afford It</strong></p>
<p><strong>Young Labour, 2 May 2012</strong></p>
<p>Young Labour is deeply concerned with the announcement that the National Government is likely to introduce further restrictions on access to student allowances, and calls on the Maori Party to oppose any such moves.</p>
<p>Young Labour&#39;s Maori Vice President, Morehu Rei, said that &quot;recent comments from Stephen Joyce about tightening the eligibility of student allowances in the upcoming budget begs the question: who on earth is National&#39;s so called &#39;brighter future&#39; for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is yet another kick in the gut to students by this National Government, many of whom rely on their student allowance to buy the essentials; accommodation, transport and food. Without these allowances, many will be deterred from attending universities, polytechnics and Wananga.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The result of these changes will mean either more debt for students, or in most cases young people forgoing further education to avoid an often insurmountable student loan&quot; stated Rei. &quot;When New Zealand has one of the highest rates of young people not in work education or training, this is totally unacceptable from a government that was elected on a promise to help lift Maori and Pasifika achievement.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The facts are simple, the people who will be affected by this are young people from poorer areas. Maori, who make up a large amount of the lowest income earners in New Zealand, will be the first to see their Rangatahi forced out of the prospects of higher education.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As a part of their confidence and supply agreement with the National Party the Maori Party will be required to vote in favour for the Governments budget on May 24. Young Labour calls on them to stick up for their people’s interest and leave the government.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have personally been fortunate enough to get an allowance from the government. I’m sure most other people with allowances are thankful for the government&#39;s support, however if this was taken away I can see further Kiwis leaving New Zealand to live overseas feeling no need or obligation to contribute to New Zealand. As the government’s assistance through allowances will help me towards a better future, it’s only fair that I put my experience back into the country that gave to me, I look forward to it” Rei added.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Government have been elected on a commitment to building a brighter future. But with more and more cuts to education from Early Childhood to Tertiary making life harder for ordinary young Kiwis, you can&#39;t help but ask &#39;who exactly is the brighter future for?&#39;&quot; Rei concluded.</p>
