<p><strong>Massey’s industrial design school ranked among best in the world</strong></p>
<p>Massey University has been ranked among the best industrial design schools in the world in the international Red Dot Design Awards.</p>
<p>Red Dot is a global design awards scheme based in Germany and Singapore. The awards are highly competitive. Last year, Red Dot received a total of 3,536 entries in the design concept category. These entries came from 54 countries and comprised concepts and prototypes from 90 universities, 230 companies, and a host of individual designers.</p>
<p>Red Dot has ranked Massey 12th in the Asia Pacific region for design concept - the only New Zealand or Australian design school to be so recognised. The top ranked Asia Pacific institution for design concept was National Taiwan University of Science and Technology; in the Americas and Europe, top rank went to ENSCI - Les Ateliers in France.</p>
<p>In a letter to Massey’s Vice-Chancellor, Red Dot’s President (Asia) Ken Koo says; “This ranking recognises your organisation as one of the top universities in the Asia Pacific to continuously and progressively produce cutting edge and forward thinking projects.”</p>
<p>The ranking is calculated using a weighted formula considering the number and classes of awards won by an institution over five years, with a strong emphasis on the most recent awards won.</p>
<p>College of Creative Arts Pro Vice-Chancellor Associate Professor Claire Robinson says the Red Dot endorsement is great news. “Few New Zealanders appreciate what a world class design school we have in this country. There are fabulously talented staff and creative young people working at the forefront of design innovation right in the heart of our capital city.”</p>
