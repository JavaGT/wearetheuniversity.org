<p><strong>Minister ignores parents’ concerns</strong></p>
<p>Parents around the country are worried about the effect of larger class sizes on their children’s learning - and rightly so, Labour’s Education spokesperson, Nanaia Mahuta says.</p>
<p>“I sought an assurance from Minister Parata today that no child will be negatively affected by being moved into larger classes.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet instead of backing her decision up with some evidence-based research, all we heard was further justification from the Minister that her trade-off – a preference for &#39;quality teachers&#39; - was the magic solution that would fix everything.</p>
<p>&quot;I am particularly concerned that children just starting school will be negatively affected, as will students attending rural and low decile schools who also face the prospect of losing teachers.</p>
<p>“This will inevitably put more pressure on those teachers left to cope with more children in larger classes,” Nanaia Mahuta said.</p>
<p>&quot;The quality of the learning classroom environment is vitally important for children starting school, yet the new ratios are going to hit exactly this demographic - Y2-Y4 - at a time when the Government has also imposed National Standards Testing in reading, writing and math.</p>
<p>&quot;Students in Y5-Y10 will also be affected at a pivotal time in their life - when they are going through adolescence. It’s a stage associated with greater risk taking tendencies and a time when peer pressure can also have a significant effect on attitude and behaviour.</p>

<p>&quot;Minister Parata is happy to make &#39;trade-offs’ in the form of larger class sizes and capped teacher numbers to satisfy the Governments &#39;zero budget&#39; target.</p>
<p>&quot;But National is on the wrong track here. All young children deserve the very best start at school - that&#39;s smaller class sizes and a teacher who is able to spend time helping them to learn, grow and extend their potential, while our teens deserve a fair deal in the classroom as well,” said Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
