<p>Study to find answers in the fat-fit debate</p>
<p>A Massey University master’s student hopes to find out if obese but active people are better off than those who are slim but inactive.</p>
<p>James Stewart, based at the School of Sport and Exercise at the Wellington campus, is looking for male participants from the Wellington region for his study.</p>
<p>“We are comparing exercise economy between obese-fit and normal weight-unfit males,” Mr Stewart says. “Exercise economy is a measure of efficiency during exercise and a predictor of overall exercise performance.”</p>
<p>“It’s an exercise study that will require the participants to use a treadmill to test their fitness,” he says. “It will test them up to 85 per cent of capacity, so won’t be too difficult.”</p>
<p>As well as the exercise test, participants will also get a full analysis of their health history and an exercise assessment and prescription, for no cost.</p>
<p>“We work up a complete risk factor assessment for each participant that includes blood pressure, a cholesterol test, glucose levels and an electrocardiography assessment,” he says.</p>
<p>From the scientific health assessment an exercise programme could be developed for each participant, that they could then use to boost fitness, working at a level that suited their current fitness level.</p>
<p>Two groups are needed for the study, unfit-normal-weight males with a body mass index between 18.5 and 24.99 kg•m2 and fit-obese males between 30 and 39.99 kg•m2.</p>
<p>“Current research suggests those individuals who are overweight but active are of a higher level of fitness and have better health than those people who may be an ideal weight, but don’t exercise,” Mr Stewart says. “I want to test that theory further.</p>
<p>“We hope to find further evidence to support the importance of cardiovascular fitness and maintaining an active lifestyle.”</p>
