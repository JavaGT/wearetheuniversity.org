<p>30 May 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>Brand New Zealand: ‘cheap and efficient’</p>
<p>Bill English’s branding of New Zealand as a cheap and efficient labour market may unfortunately be gaining traction, with a survey suggesting Kiwis are ‘happy’ to work longer hours for less in comparison to their Australian counterparts.</p>
<p>Despite The Regus Work-life Balance Index drawing its conclusions from only 54 New Zealand participants, the implications are concerning.</p>
<p>“Just because Kiwis are happy to keep their heads down and get on with the job doesn’t mean we can justify our low wages and long working hours.</p>
<p>“The goodwill and work ethic of ordinary Kiwis cannot become New Zealand’s competitive advantage,” Darien Fenton said.</p>
<p>“Kiwis are working harder for less, so to suggest there has been a dramatic increase in job satisfaction or work-life balance is a contradiction. As Massey University sociologist, Professor Paul Spoonley says, it is more likely that the data has been skewed by those unhappy in their jobs moving overseas.</p>
<p>“Workers face desperate times. If they are staying in New Zealand they are working harder because they have to. Wages are stagnant and the cost of living continues to climb.</p>
<p>“Bill English’s latest Budget bought no relief, demanding that we simply keep on keeping on.</p>
<p>“Well I have a message for Mr English and the National Government. No matter how hard New Zealanders work their efforts are not going to make up for a government with no vision and no plan,” Darien Fenton said.</p>
<p>“New Zealand has the potential to be a competitive high-tech, high-skill, high- wage economy, but not with a Government that continues to sell us short.”</p>
