<p>Waiariki MP Relieved at Successful Rescue of Tauranga class</p>
<p>Te Ururoa Flavell, MP for Waiariki, has expressed his great relief at hearing the news last night of the successful rescue of ten Tauranga schoolgirls who had been lost in the Kaimai Mamaku Forest Park.</p>
<p>“Like everyone involved, I was greatly concerned as the night approached and was frantically making calls back to Tauranga to hear the latest update,” said Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>“My first thoughts are for the young women and their whānau, who have had the great fortune to emerge safely out of this ordeal.</p>
<p>“No doubt in the cold light of day, Tauranga Intermediate School will be reviewing every aspect of this incident, particularly its policies around the safety and welfare of students attending any outdoor recreation activities”.</p>
<p>“The Māori Party fully supports any opportunities for active learning outdoors, which can be challenging in all senses – physically, socially, spiritually, mentally. Education outside the classroom can provide powerful experiences to develop skills, as well as nurture a sense of appreciation of our natural environment – our maunga, awa, puke, moana, ngahere, whenua – and we believe every child should experience that”/</p>
<p>“This ordeal will have heightened the vital need to be ‘adventure smart’ – for each of us to take responsibility for our own safety; to be aware and always prepared for the worst.</p>
<p>“It is also an opportunity to acknowledge the prompt and effective actions of the ground search parties, local police, the rescue helicopter crews, the St Johns Ambulance team and all those involved in bringing the children home”.</p>
