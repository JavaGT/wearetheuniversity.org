<p>Me and Tom Scott: live on stage</p>
<p>Family and friends of Massey’s Wellington graduates will be able to watch this Thursday’s graduation ceremonies – and guest speaker Tom Scott – live online for the first time.</p>
<p>The University began live streaming graduation last year when it trialled the system in Manawatu. This year, Massey’s Graduation Live initiative has been extended to Massey campuses nationwide. Graduates can tag the precise moment at which they cross the stage to receive their scroll, and share this on social media.</p>
<p>On Thursday 626 students will graduate in two ceremonies at the Michael Fowler Centre. Seven will receive the highest academic award, a doctoral degree (PhD); 56 will gain a master’s degree. Fifty-two are Maori or Pasifika graduands.</p>
<p>Renowned cartoonist, writer, playwright, comedian and Massey alumnus Tom Scott will give the keynote address at both ceremonies. In 1972, Mr Scott graduated from Massey with a Bachelor of Science in physiology, and in 2002, the University awarded him an honorary doctorate. He also has personal links with the less formal side of Massey graduation: in his youth, he edited Masskerade 69, one of the most outrageous capping magazines in New Zealand’s history.</p>
