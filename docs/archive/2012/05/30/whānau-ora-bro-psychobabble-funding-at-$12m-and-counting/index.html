<p><strong>Wednesday, 30 May 2012, 2:55 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters<br>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>30 May 2012</p>
<p><strong>Whānau Ora ‘Bro-Psychobabble’ Funding At $12 Million – And Counting</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is asking the Government to explain how it can tax paper boys while the Māori Party wastes $12 million to finance what amounts to Whānau Ora ‘mumbo jumbo’.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters says more outrageous Whānau Ora bro-ocracy funding decisions are being uncovered by the day.</p>
<p>“A family was given $4500 to ‘develop a strategy to promote who they are’ and strengthen connections to each other.</p>
<p>“Another family was handed $5000 to take control of their lives and move out of the ‘status quo lifestyle’.</p>
<p>“And then there’s the ludicrous funding of $5000 so a family can create a plan that ‘weaves the strands of whānau together with a collective goal of reconnection’.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says this is just the start of Whānau Ora funding which unless scrapped by the Government will potentially cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>“Funding has so far largely been used to feed the creation of the so-called ‘whānau plans’ which in essence are used for getting more money out of the system.</p>
<p>“Soon the people behind these plans will be back asking for more Government funding to implement them.</p>
<p>“This has clearly been dreamt up in a sociology department of some second-rate university,” says Mr Peters.</p>
