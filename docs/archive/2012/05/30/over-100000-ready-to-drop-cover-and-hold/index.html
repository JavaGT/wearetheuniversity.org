<p>Media Statement</p>
<p>Over 100,000 ready to Drop, Cover and Hold</p>
<p>Civil Defence Minister Chris Tremain says that an initial milestone has been reached today with over 100,000 people registered to participate in the first nationwide ShakeOut earthquake drill.</p>
<p>“The Canterbury earthquakes have shown us that we need to be prepared for major earthquakes, and practise how to protect ourselves when they happen,” says Mr Tremain.</p>
<p>“New Zealand ShakeOut is an important Civil Defence initiative and I’m pleased to see workplaces, schools and families are getting behind it.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Civil Defence &amp; Emergency Management has written to major government agencies and New Zealand’s 100 largest businesses about Shakeout this week, and I encourage them to get on board.”</p>
<p>New Zealand ShakeOut aims to have one million people Drop, Cover and Hold at 9.26am on Wednesday September 26th 2012 (9:26-26:9).</p>
<p>The drill is supported by a dedicated website, <a href="http://www.getthru.govt.nz">www.getthru.govt.nz</a>. People can visit the website to get information on earthquakes, preparedness, and the ShakeOut drill in September.</p>
