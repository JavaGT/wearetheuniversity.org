<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters<br>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>11 May 2012</p>
<p><strong>Flawed Pig Meat Import Standards Must Be Dropped – Peters</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is calling on the Government to drop changes to pig meat import standards because of the risk of spreading a highly infectious disease amongst pigs.</p>
<p>New Zealand First leader Rt Hon Winston Peters says the new standards permit imports of untreated pig meat from countries infected by the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) virus.</p>
<p>“The New Zealand Pork industry holds serious concerns that PRRS will enter the country under these new import standards.</p>
<p>“It will greatly increase the risk of infected meat being fed to pigs, which is how the virus is transmitted.</p>
<p>“If lax import standards allow the virus into New Zealand then it could spread with alarming speed through farmed and wild pig populations.</p>
<p>“The financial impact on pig farmers and associated businesses could be massive.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says animal experts liken the highly infectious PRRS to HIV in humans. It can cause stillborn foetuses, abortion or respiratory sickness among pigs.</p>
<p>“A 2004 PRRS outbreak in South Africa was blamed on infected meat being fed to pigs. Thousands of animals had to be killed.</p>
<p>“We are one of only a few countries in the world to be PRRS-free and we need to keep it that way.</p>
<p>“PRRS threatens the New Zealand pork industry in the same way the varroa mite affects bees and Psa devastates kiwifruit.</p>
<p>“The Government must intervene and stop the introduction of these defective standards to safeguard the pork industry and our wild pig populations,” says Mr Peters.</p>
