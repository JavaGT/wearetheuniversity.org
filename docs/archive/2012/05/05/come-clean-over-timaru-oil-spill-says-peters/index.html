<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters</p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader</p>

<p>Come clean Over Timaru Oil Spill Says Peters</p>
<p>New Zealand First has called on Environment Canterbury and Timaru Port authorities to reveal the extent of a major oil spill in the area during the week.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters says he has been reliably informed that 40,000 litres of fuel was spilled and all that authorities will reveal is that it was a “significant” amount.</p>
<p>Mr Peters says the people of South Canterbury have a right to know the extent of the pollution on their coastline and what is being done about it.</p>
<p>“This oil spill from a deep sea fishing boat happened because someone made a mistake.</p>
<p>“An alarm should have sounded that the oil was going into the sea and an inquiry should establish whether this safety system failed.</p>
<p>“Too many ships are causing problems. The wreck of the Rena is still causing headaches in the Bay of Plenty and further up the Coromandel coastline.</p>
<p>“It’s time the government and the maritime authorities took some responsibility for what is happening to our coastline before there is an event of catastrophic proportion,” says Mr Peters.</p>
