<p><strong>UC Student Events Centre Update</strong></p>
<p>An independent investigation commissioned by the University of Canterbury has attributed the underlying cause of a floor subsidence during a performance by hip hop artist Savage at the newly-opened student events centre to human error.</p>
<p>The investigation has found that a commercial structural engineer whose firm was contracted to contribute to the design of the events centre did not calculate a dynamic load for the floor, which meant its design was not adequate to support dancing by a large number of people.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says: &quot;The independent structural engineer&#39;s report that we commissioned is in the process of being peer reviewed. But, in the meantime, preparations are underway to have the floor repaired and the centre re-opened.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Carr says while only a small area of the centre&#39;s total floor space was affected by the subsidence on 13 July, the entire floor area will be strengthened. It is anticipated that work will begin within a week, and will be completed within three to four weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;We have appreciated the way in which our contractors have responded positively to this situation,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>University of Canterbury Students&#39; Association President, Erin Jackson, says students are looking forward to seeing the events centre re-open.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that Savage may even be able to come back to Christchurch some time to finish his set.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Carr says the findings of the investigation have been shared with relevant contractors.</p>
<p>The University will be making no further comment.</p>
