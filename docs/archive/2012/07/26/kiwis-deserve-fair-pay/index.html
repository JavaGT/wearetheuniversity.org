<p><strong>Thursday, 26 July 2012, 2:21 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>David<br>CLARK<br>MP for Dunedin North</p>
<p>26 July 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT<br>Kiwis deserve fair pay</p>
<p>“Hard-working New Zealanders deserve to earn a living wage for an honest day’s work,” says the Labour MP, David Clark.</p>
<p>His members’ bill to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour was drawn from the ballot today, meaning MPs will debate the issue later this year.</p>
<p>It’s David Clark’s second bill to be selected from the ballot. Parliament yesterday voted in favour of the first reading of his legalisation to ensure workers get a public holiday on a Monday following the commemoration of Anzac Day and Waitangi Day when they fall on a weekend.</p>
<p>“I don’t know anyone who thinks they could raise a family on $15 an hour. If you are working a 40-hour week you should be able to pay the bills and put dinner on the table.”</p>
<p>The minimum wage is currently $13.50 an hour, and David Clark says increasing it to $15 will help thousands of working families make ends meet.</p>
<p>“There is too much inequality in New Zealand. Poverty is destroying lives and wasting the opportunity to get the best out of our people.”</p>
<p>“Kiwi workers are worth more than $1350 an hour. New Zealand can’t just be a low-wage economy. We must do better than that.”  </p>
