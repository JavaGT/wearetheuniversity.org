<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE – TUESDAY 3 JULY 2012</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Farming competition extends its criteria to attract top performers</strong></p>
<p>Excellence, leadership and sustainability have been added to the criteria for judging the Lincoln University Foundation’s South Island Farmer of the Year competition for 2012.</p>
<p>In 2011 the prestigious annual competition had a focus on innovation. Although this focus attracted top-class entries, the actual number of entries was not high. Foundation chair Neil Taylor says this year a wider approach has been taken to encourage entries from a wider spectrum of excellent farmers.</p>
<p>“We felt a focus solely on innovation meant some top farmers who could have been nominated for this competition missed out. Some people interpreted the innovation criteria quite narrowly and felt the competition was only for people doing something new.</p>
<p>“But, while innovation and cutting edge development will always be a strong component of the competition, we’re also looking in 2012 for examples of excellence in farming, of leadership in the industry, and evidence that farming practices are being carried out in a sustainable way that supports the environment. The balance of these factors can be different in each entry, but all need to be present in farms chosen as finalists.”</p>
<p>Entries for the 2012 competition close on 1 August.</p>
<p>The aim of the Lincoln University Foundation South Island Farmer of the Year competition is to reward farmers whose work showcases the best of what can be achieved in farming. Entering has been made easier with a simplified on-line form, or printed forms are available from CRT FarmCentres throughout the South Island.</p>

<p>“Entering is an exciting challenge,” Taylor says. “Farmers have to be prepared to put a bit of time into the entry form, open their farm to judges, and overcome the traditional rural reluctance to put themselves out there. But previous entrants tell us the effort is more than rewarded by the positive outcomes and the wonderful support they get from friends, neighbours and colleagues.”</p>
<p>The competition is open to South Island land-based farmers, managers, partners and businesses. All types of primary land use are eligible to enter including wineries, orchardists, olive growers as well as traditional pastoral and arable land farming.</p>
<p>Winners will have demonstrated they are in the top echelon of agricultural producers and that they have developed, or are developing, approaches inside or beyond the farm gate that enhance farming activity. This activity must be measurable and the knowledge behind it able to be shared with others.</p>
<p>“Through raising the profile of such farmers we hope others will be able to adapt these ideas so they can grow their own business and ensure New Zealand farmers remain world leaders,” Taylor says.<br>ENDS  </p>
