<p>AUSA endorses marriage equality and adoption law reform for same sex couples</p>
<p>The Auckland University Students Association is proud to endorse marriage equality and adoption law reform for same sex couples.</p>
<p>On Monday night, at the Auckland University Students Association’s executive meeting, two motions relating to equality for queer students were moved by the newly elected Queer Rights Officer and both motions were passed by the executive.<br>The first which was passed unanimously, was that AUSA officially supports marriage equality and the removal of gender from the 1955 marriage act. The second was that AUSA endorses law reform, allowing same sex couples the right to adoption.</p>
<p>&quot;As student leaders, we&#39;ve taken a stand on this issue which will directly effect our queer students and their right to be treated equally in the eyes of the law,&quot; said Arena Williams, President of the Auckland University Students&#39; Association.</p>
<p>In May 2012, AUSA elected its very first Queer Rights Officer, Levi Joule. The position was created to provide queer students on campus with representation on the executive and to ensure that the University campus is inclusive.</p>
<p>&quot;This stance, in combination with the creation of the Queer Rights Officer position, is symbolic of the Association’s commitment to equality for queer students and ensuring that equality for citizens regardless of sexual orientation is achieved,&quot; said Joule.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s a lot to be done in this new role. Queer students need a strong voice within the University, as well as an active organiser to bring together supportive peer networks,&quot; said Joule.</p>
<p>The Auckland University Students Association has throughout its history taken strong stands against discrimination and prejudice in the law.</p>
