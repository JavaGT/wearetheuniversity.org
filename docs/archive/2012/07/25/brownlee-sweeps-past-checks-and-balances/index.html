<p><strong>Brownlee sweeps past checks and balances</strong></p>
<p>Gerry Brownlee is avoiding public consultation and the scrutiny of the courts despite the promises made when he introduced his sweeping earthquake powers, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Lianne Dalziel.</p>
<p>“When Gerry Brownlee brought in the Earthquake Recovery Act he claimed the checks and balances would ensure that the necessary powers for recovery were used judiciously, be open to public scrutiny, and provide for appeal.”</p>
<p>“Gerry Brownlee failed his first test in front of the court and not only did he avoid all of these checks on his power, he overrode private rights as well.</p>
<p>“Gerry Brownlee could have used other processes under the act that would have allowed for public scrutiny or official oversight. Instead he bulldozed his way through using a section of the act that was designed for a different purpose.</p>
<p>“Labour agreed to support the government introducing the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act, despite public concern about the powers, however we do expect Gerry Brownlee to exercise his sweeping powers judiciously and in accordance with the law.”</p>
