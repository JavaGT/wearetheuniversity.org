<p>Mr Wilkins says he is looking forward to beginning his new role. “The IIML is the country&#39;s premiere destination for creative writers, with a growing international reputation. I&#39;m thrilled about having the chance to extend the astonishing legacy Bill Manhire has built up over the years.”</p>
<p>Mr Wilkins is the author of nine books, including the novels <em>The Miserables</em>, which won the New Zealand Book Award for fiction in 1994, and <em>Nineteen Widows Under Ash</em>, which was joint runner up for the Deutz Prize for Fiction in the 2001 Montana New Zealand Book Awards. His novel <em>The Fainter</em> was runner-up for the Montana Medal for Fiction in 2007. In 2008 he was awarded the New Zealand Post Mansfield Prize to travel to Menton, France, where he produced his latest novel <em>Somebody Loves Us All.</em>  </p>
<p>He has scripted numerous works for television, radio and more recently theatre. His television scriptwriting includes work on <em>Duggan</em> and <em>The Insiders Guide to Happiness</em> and his first play, <em>Drinking Games</em>, was produced at Circa Theatre in 2008. Mr Wilkins was the founding editor of literary journal <em>Sport</em>, and has been an active member of many initiatives to foster creative writing in New Zealand throughout his career.</p>
<p>Mr Wilkins first joined Victoria’s English Department in 1985 as a Junior Lecturer, before leaving for the United States to complete a Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing at Washington University, St Louis.
