<p><strong>Study to find best exercises for Maori men</strong></p>
<p>The best type of exercise to reduce the risk of diabetes and combat obesity-related illness in Maori men is the focus of a Massey University study.</p>
<p>Dr Isaac Warbrick from the School of Sport and Exercise is leading the three-year study involving 40 participants from the Manawatu and Horowhenua region.</p>
<p>They are defined as being aged over 25, inactive, with a body mass index (BMI) over 25 but “outwardly healthy,” Dr Warbrick says.</p>
<p>The men will be split into three groups with each assigned a different mode of exercise: resistance (weight) training, cardio (swimming, running, cycling) and a mix of both. They will have group exercise sessions with a trainer for periods of 30 minutes, three times a week for 12 weeks.</p>
<p>“We are ultimately going to assess the impact of that 12 weeks on metabolic health, the risk of diabetes, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance,” he says. “But we’ll also measure subjective wellbeing. We’ll be doing qualitative analysis, asking them about their thoughts and preferences towards exercise and physical activity.”</p>
<p>The men will be asked about their experiences with, and feelings towards exercise before and after they finish the 12-week programme. “That’s another aspect of the study, we’re trying to gauge what Maori men think about exercise,” he says. “It’s one thing identifying the best type of exercise to enhance physical health, but if no one’s going to do it, then there’s no point.”</p>

<p>The study will be conducted in three waves with the first group to start their exercise programme tomorrow. It will also evaluate the impact the exercise programme had on overall wellness such as the men’s time with family, mood and outlook on life.</p>
<p>Dr Warbrick says the study is novel. “It will identify from a physiological standpoint if there is one exercise superior to another, while assessing the impact of exercise participation on overall wellbeing and attitudes towards exercise.”</p>
<p>Exercising in small groups will also provide opportunities for social interaction, and it is crucial that participants feel comfortable and enjoy the experience. “The whānau approach is an important part of the research. Physical activity and exercise programmes need to utilise social interaction.”</p>
<p>Dr Warbrick says he has always been interested in preventative health, and this study will explore how physical activity can be a tool to improve physical health but also overall wellbeing.</p>
