<p>12 July 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Condolences extended to Ngati Tuwharetoa</strong></p>
<p>Labour is offering its sincere condolences to the family of Timoti Te Heuheu and also to the people of Ngati Tuwharetoa who have lost a well-known and popular leader, says Labour Leader David Shearer.</p>
<p>“Timi was a colourful character who was much-loved by the community he lived in and the people whose lives he has touched over decades of service to New Zealand.</p>
<p>“He was a strong leader and often represented his older brother, the paramount chief of Tuwharetoa, Sir Tumu Te Heuheu.</p>
<p>“Timi was a political figurehead who engaged with both Labour and National-led Governments. He moved freely amongst many iwi and was a trusted friend to iwi leaders,” David Shearer said.</p>
<p>Labour’s spokesperson for Maori Affairs Parekura Horomia says Timi Te Heuheu represented Tuwharetoa interests passionately.</p>
<p>“Timi was a member of the iwi council of the Waikato District Health Board and a member of the iwi catchment committee Te Roopu Manukura for the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>“His unstinting loyalty and commitment to Maoridom as a whole was admired by many. Having worked with him over several years I know Timi was trusted and respected, not just by Maori but by other New Zealanders as well. He was simply a kanohi ki te kanohi person. He will be sadly missed.</p>
<p>“Our deepest sympathy goes to his wife Georgina Te Heuheu, his two sons Mananui and Tuirirangi, his mokopuna and his wider whanau,” Parekura Horomia said.</p>
