<p>Raymond<br>HUO<br>List MP</p>
<p>12 July 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Solutions needed for student visa processing</strong></p>
<p>A lack of vision and long-term strategy from the National Government have directly contributed to the student visa application fraud debacle, says Labour’s Export Education Spokesperson Raymond Huo.</p>
<p>“Instead of tightening our regulation and border controls, in the last Budget the National Government decided to cut $170,000 a year of funding for the regulation of immigration advisers.</p>
<p>“These advisors are a part of the regime that play an active role in immigration processes including student visa applications.</p>
<p>“Under the current licensing regime anyone giving immigration advice must have a licence whether they are onshore or offshore --except if they are an exempt person.</p>
<p>“An ‘exempt person’ can include people providing advice offshore about students&#39; visa applications - which, under current circumstances, has caused problems and needs a new approach to ensure a situation, such as the fraud debacle we are faced with, doesn’t happen again However, the so-called Super Minister Steven Joyce seems content to just sit there doing nothing but wait for the time bomb to go off.</p>
<p>“Concerned parties told me that the line between applications for immigrants and those for international students are becoming blurred. This should be a concern, but doesn’t seem to be on the government’s radar</p>

<p>“The rules must be tightened to make sure only eligible and qualified students are coming to New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;As a country we have the prerogative to decide who we target as prospective students. If we can prove to the world that we are good-quality providers, we will attract good quality students.</p>
<p>&quot;If the government continues to senselessly cut costs the quality of agencies like Immigration New Zealand will suffer said Raymond Huo.  </p>
