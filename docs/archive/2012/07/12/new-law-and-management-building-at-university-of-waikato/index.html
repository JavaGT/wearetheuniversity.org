<p>12 July 2012</p>
<p>New law and management building set to take University of Waikato into its next half century</p>
<p>The University of Waikato is to mark its 50th anniversary with the construction of a flagship new building for its law and management faculties.</p>
<p>Plans for a multi-million dollar building to house Te Piringa -- Faculty of Law and Waikato Management School’s Centre for Corporate and Executive Education and student services were approved by the University’s Council last week.</p>
<p>The University will now move forward to develop a detailed design of the new building, with tendering expected to take place during 2013. It’s anticipated construction will be completed in early 2015 – the year after the University turns 50.</p>
<p>“The University of Waikato is committed to delivering a world-class education and research portfolio,” says Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford.</p>
<p>“To do that, we need top-quality facilities. The new building will nurture collaboration and allow for the growth and development of our faculties of law and management, as well as enhancing our superb campus.”</p>
<p>Professor Crawford says the new facilities will allow the Centre for Corporate and Executive Education to extend its programmes serving businesses in the region, and will also create space for new law research centres – the Māori and Indigenous Governance Centre and the Centre for Environmental Resources and Energy Law as well as the Waikato Management School’s Institute for Business Research.</p>

<p>The new building will feature a striking rectilinear five-storey office tower with vertical sunshade vanes referencing the tukutuku reed panels in a traditional meeting house. The tower will be linked at ground level to the existing Management building on Hillcrest Road.</p>
<p>Head of Facilities Management John Cameron says the high-profile site will complete a string of three iconic campus facilities.</p>
<p>“Our architects, Opus, have provided an environmentally sustainable design featuring a green roof, natural ventilation and glazed corridor walls for natural lighting. The new building will join our Student Centre, completed last year and the first five-star green building in the Waikato region, and the award-winning Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts, overlooking the campus lakes.”</p>
<p>The new building will provide teaching rooms, offices, dedicated spaces for postgraduate students, shared student services, shared computer labs, a reception area and a ceremonial space for meetings with university visitors.</p>
<p>It will also include a fully functional moot courtroom, and a sunken courtyard.</p>
