<p>20 July, 2012<br><strong>Philip Morris Should Butt Out Of Efforts To Reduce Smoking</strong></p>
<p>Philip Morris knows its product kills New Zealanders but is pushing addicts to pressure the Government to drop measures which would make it harder to smoke.</p>
<p>The Government is proposing a series of tax hikes which will mean a pack of cigarettes will cost $20 by 2016. It is also considering plain packaging.</p>
<p>“Today’s revelation that Philip Morris has set up a website and is trying to get smokers to make submissions is disturbing,” said Green Party health spokesperson Kevin Hague.</p>
<p>“It is immoral for a company that knows its product is lethal to actively urge smokers to soften attempts to save lives.</p>
<p>“Around 5000 New Zealanders die every year due to smoking and second-hand smoke and half of long-term smokers die of a related illness.</p>
<p>“Tobacco companies spend enough money on lobbying without stooping to try and enlist the people they are killing.”</p>
<p>From Monday tobacco displays have to be removed from shops.</p>
<p>Despite arguments during hearings on that change research released today shows that retailers are not overly concerned. The University of Otago, research found most retailers were relaxed about the change.</p>
<p>Many retailers felt ambivalent about selling tobacco and would rather not sell it.</p>
<p>Previous research they did found that 65% of a sample of over 1300 smokers agreed with the statement &#39;tobacco companies should be more tightly regulated’”.</p>
