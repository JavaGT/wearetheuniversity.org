<p><strong>Penny pinching on postgraduate allowances will undermine future health sector workforce</strong>  </p>
<p>The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) has joined its voice to the mounting chorus of concern about the negative impacts that cutting allowances for students enrolled in postgraduate health courses will have - as spelled out this week in statements by the NZ College of Clinical Psychologists (NZCCP) and wider Allied Health Professional Associations’ Forum (AHPAF).</p>
<p>“Before the Budget, NZUSA sounded a clear warning that cuts to allowances would be shortsighted and likely to have long-term negative implications for New Zealand’s future social and economic needs. We rejected the direction being taken, and the unnecessary consequences these cuts will cause,” said Pete Hodkinson, NZUSA President.</p>
<p>“Advice given to Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce clearly has not taken into account all of the foreseeable impacts on postgraduate students such as those highlighted by NZCCP and AHPAF.”</p>
<p>“NZUSA shares the strong concerns expressed by NZCCP and AHPAF that as a result of this shortsighted and ill-informed Budget decision, students will simply not be in a position to afford to complete their studies. This means their future prospects of filling identified gaps in the New Zealand health sector workforce are being deliberately cut off.”</p>
<p>“Students who embark on postgraduate studies and training in the health professions are being unfairly targeted by the government. The perverse assumption appears to be that students who make a lifetime commitment to longer, and by degrees more expensive, courses of postgraduate study will magically continue to do so without any access to student allowances to support them to complete those courses,” said Pete Hodkinson.</p>

<p>“Taking on more debt is a proven disincentive for students who are committed to training in professions that the government also says are in high demand, and that are essential to our public health system. If New Zealand students cannot fill the jobs independently listed by Immigration NZ on the Long Term Skill Shortage List, the people who will pay are consumers of healthcare.”</p>
<p>“NZUSA urges the Minister and his officials to recalculate the pennies they may be saving against the long-term costs. The call made by NZCCP and AHPAF to reverse this bad decision has to be heeded. It is causing unacceptable disproportional anxiety to students.”</p>
