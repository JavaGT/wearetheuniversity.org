<p><strong>University of Canterbury welcomes Central City Plan for Christchurch</strong></p>
<p>University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor, Dr Rod Carr, says the release of the Central City Plan is an important step forward and will build great confidence for the city and region.</p>
<p>“The University will be a significant player in the new Health Precinct. We already have a major presence near the hospital at the New Zealand Brain Research Institute which houses research programmes in swallowing disorders, health technology and psychology. At present there are 12 staff and students (Masters and PhD) located at the Institute.</p>
<p>“The University now looks forward to establishing an interdisciplinary Health Campus in the new precinct, with clinical services and health researchers co-located.”</p>
<p>The University is also a collaborating partner with the Canterbury District Health Board in the Health Innovation Hub which will be located in the precinct.</p>
<p>Dr Carr says a thriving central city will also help the region keep students here after they graduate.</p>
<p>“It is these high-spending professionals in their twenties who, historically, have left Christchurch for the likes of Wellington – attracted by job opportunities, inner-city living and entertainment. This is our chance to create an environment where these talented people want to live, work and play – for the benefit of all New Zealanders.”  </p>
