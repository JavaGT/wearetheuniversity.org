<p><strong>Marine industry worth 1.7 billion to New Zealand – AUT launches the first Bachelor of Engineering in Maritime Engineering</strong>  </p>
<p>In a New Zealand first, Auckland University of Technology (AUT) and the Australian Maritime College (AMC) in Launceston, Tasmania, Australia have come together to offer the Bachelor of Engineering in Maritime Engineering in this country. The partnership between AUT University and AMC provides a unique opportunity to students in New Zealand – a country that offers no undergraduate professional maritime engineering degrees even though it has an exceptionally strong maritime industry.</p>
<p>The programme of study offered has been designed to address an unmet need for maritime Bachelor of Engineering Honours degrees in the New Zealand university system. It will also enhance the level of engagement by New Zealand academics in maritime engineering research and commercialisation. The partnership will involve project engagements with industry, ensuring that industry requirements are being met in the classroom and that AUT’s graduates remain highly employable.</p>
<p>The industry is worth $650 million per annum in exports to New Zealand and Peter Busfield, CEO of the NZ Marine Export Group and Executive Director of the NZ Marine Industry Association and NZ Marine Industry Training Organisation, says “the New Zealand Marine industry looks forward to the skills this will bring to the design and technology manufacturing profession”.</p>
<p>From 2013 AUT University students will have the opportunity to commence their studies at AUT’s City campus in one of three majors:<br>1. Bachelor of Engineering (Naval Architecture)<br>2. Bachelor of Engineering (Ocean Engineering)<br>3. Bachelor of Engineering (Marine and Offshore Systems Engineering)</p>

<p>AUT University’s Professor John Raine, Pro-Vice Chancellor Innovation and Enterprise and Head of School of Engineering, describes the initial course format, “In the initial stages at least, students will complete all of years 3 and 4 of the degree at the Australian Maritime College in Launceston, Tasmania. Postgraduate students under this joint venture will be able to study in New Zealand and Australia, particularly on marine industry-linked projects”.</p>
