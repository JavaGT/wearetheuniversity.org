<p>30 July 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>New Zealanders have a choice on inequality</p>
<p>New Zealanders have a choice between a fair and decent society or a nation divided by inequality, after new figures show the income gap between races is increasing, says Labour’s Finance spokesperson David Parker.</p>
<p>“The recession has hit the incomes of Māori and Pacific Islanders particularly hard. New Zealand already has the fastest rate of inequality in the OECD and it appears to be getting faster.</p>
<p>“The good news is we have a choice. We can choose to have a decent and just society where all Kiwis have a fair go. To do that we need higher wages and more opportunities for New Zealanders and we will get that through better and higher-paid jobs.</p>
<p>“Labour’s policies will focus on growing better businesses that export more products, bring more money into New Zealand and create jobs that pay a higher wage. By increasing savings though compulsory Kiwisaver and directing that money into exports using pro-growth tax reform we will increase wages and create higher paid jobs.</p>
<p>“Our policy to increase the minimum wage to one families can live on will reward hard-work and help stem the flow of thousands of people to Australia where wages are much higher.</p>
<p>“Most New Zealanders came to these shores seeking a fair and equal society where Jack is as good as his master. That spirit of society still shines through in Kiwis today.</p>
<p>“Labour has a vision of a modern New Zealand economy while the government sits on its hands hoping that growth will magically appear. That will not bring back the egalitarian society so many in this country yearn for.”<br>ends</p>
