<p><strong>University appoints new Mäori and Pasifika leader</strong></p>
<p>Massey University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey has announced the appointment of Dr Selwyn Katene as the University&#39;s Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Mäori and Pasifika).</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Katene has a strong public policy and strategic planning background, primarily in the field of Mäori development, including research interests in Mäori health, history and academic leadership,&quot; Mr Maharey says.</p>
<p>Dr Katene (Ngäti Toa, Ngäti Tüwharetoa, Ngäruahine, Ngäti Tama) was, until recently, director of the Massey-led inter-university Mäori academy MANU AO (Mäori Academic Network across Universities in Aotearoa), which was set up to advance Mäori leadership and scholarship and strengthen links between academics and professionals.</p>
<p>He was Mental Health Commission general manager from 2006-08 and prior to that adviser to the Minister of Health and a senior manager in the Ministry of Health and Public Health Commission. Previously he held marketing management positions in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>He has a PhD in Mäori Studies from Massey (2006), a Bachelor of Arts (Hons), Master of Arts and Master of Public Management from Victoria University of Wellington, and he has completed international management training programmes at Cambridge and New South Wales Universities.</p>
<p>Dr Katene says he wants to concentrate in particular on building leadership capability within Massey&#39;s Mäori and Pasifika academic community and is committed to quality research, scholarship, teaching and learning that advances Mäori and Pasifika development goals.</p>

<p>&quot;Much of my initial focus will be to strengthen college capacity to respond to Mäori, Pasifika and also migrant communities, ensure ongoing community engagement, and to support a distributed Mäori and Pasifika leadership network across the campuses in Albany, Manawatü and Wellington.</p>
<p>&quot;Leading the Mäori and Pasifika community as facilitator, advocate and champion for Mäori and Pasifika academic success will be a humbling, yet rewarding, experience. It&#39;s an honour to carry on the work of Mason Durie, who set such high standards of leadership for all of us, not just here at Massey but for Mäori everywhere. I see myself following in Mason&#39;s footsteps rather than trying to fill his shoes. It&#39;s a challenging opportunity but one that I am tremendously excited about.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Katene commences in the role on August 6.  </p>
