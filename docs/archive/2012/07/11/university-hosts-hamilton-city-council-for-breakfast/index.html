<p><strong>University hosts Hamilton City Council for breakfast</strong>  </p>
<p>Hamilton City’s senior executives and councillors were hosted by the University of Waikato at a breakfast today.</p>
<p>At the breakfast the university announced its plans for a new Law and Management building to be completed by early 2015.</p>
<p>The university’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford told the city council that the university and council were partners in many ways, and he was pleased to be making the first announcement of the building at the breakfast. The city and the university worked well together he said, to make the Hamilton an attractive place to live, work and study.</p>
<p>Professor Crawford told the councillors and executives that Waikato had recently been ranked 58th in the world of universities under 50 years old. “We have major plans for this university – we are starting to make our mark on the world.”</p>
<p>He said the new Law and Management building would be a flagship building for the university and would create a corridor of iconic buildings from the bottom of campus with the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts, to the award-winning Student Centre at the heart of campus, through to the new building on Hillcrest Rd.</p>
<p>Mayor Julie Hardaker is a Waikato University law alumna; she was among the first students to study when the faculty opened 20 years ago. She told the university that the partnership between the faculties of Law and Management in a new building was highly appropriate.</p>
