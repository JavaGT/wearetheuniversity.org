<p><strong>Health Research Features At Parliamentary Presentations</strong></p>
<p>The University of Otago will present a series of talks on health research for MPs and policy makers at parliament in collaboration with the University of Auckland and Wellington’s Malaghan Institute.</p>
<p>The event will be hosted by the Minister of Health, Tony Ryall at 5.30 in the Grand Hall on Tuesday July 31.</p>
<p>The presentations by five cancer researchers for five minutes each on the theme of cancer will be followed by a roadshow to provincial centres. Pro-Vice-Chancellor Health Sciences, Professor Peter Crampton, says they will demonstrate the vital importance of health research for the well-being of New Zealanders, our health system, and our economy.</p>
<p>“The talks and the roadshow will clearly demonstrate that New Zealand has world class health researchers who make a difference,” says Professor Crampton. “They will convey the exciting work that is being done by our talented researchers, and how they help to improve the health system.”</p>
<p>Otago researchers, Associate Professor Parry Guilford, Director of the Centre for Translational Cancer Research and Cancer Genetics Laboratory, and Professor Tony Blakely, Director of the Health Inequalities Research Programme and Burden of Disease Epidemiology Equity and Cost Effectiveness Programme will speak about cancer research. Posters will also be presented by Professor Bridget Robinson, Professor Catherine Day and Dr Rose Richards. Talks and posters will also be presented by the University of Auckland and the Malaghan Institute.</p>

<p>Professor Crampton says the talks will also demonstrate the importance of basic science as the vital foundation for applied health research, and that one is not possible without the other. He says universities have a major role in developing basic science research and this needs to be clearly understood by the community and MPs.</p>
<p>“Social and economic impacts are guaranteed from this research. But it’s not always immediately evident that this is going to happen when a scientist starts out on his or her journey of research and investigation.”</p>
<p>“We want to explain to MPs and policymakers how science works, the process, and that basic science underpins other health research in this country.”</p>
