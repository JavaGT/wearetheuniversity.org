<p><strong>Kobe plugs views of kiwi sport psychologist</strong></p>
<p>World basketball great Kobe Bryant has promoted the views of Massey sport psychologist Professor Gary Hermansson and posted a link to the Massey News website on Facebook for his 13 million followers to read earlier today.</p>
<p>The post has already received 3300 &quot;likes&quot; and, within five hours, generated 5692 unique page views of a story and video link that went online 22 days ago.</p>
<p>Mr Bryant, from the United States Olympic team and five-time National Basketball Association champion player from the Los Angeles Lakers, has a fortune estimated at $US200 million and is arguably the greatest and most famous star of basketball.</p>
<p>Professor Hermansson, who is in London with the New Zealand Olympic team, was interviewed at Massey before he left and his views and a video of the interview posted on the University&#39;s website earlier this month. He outlines the key factors high-performance athletes need to focus on to achieve at the top level.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought it might be good to share a little piece I found online about training the mind so the body can perform at its highest potential, even in the most pressure packed environment,&quot; Mr Bryant says.</p>
<p>Massey web content manager Glen Young says the hit rate was huge. &quot;Massey&#39;s entire website gets more than 40,000 unique visitors a week and hits on this one story in just a few hours after the Bryant facebook posting accounted for 15 cent of the 81,784 unique page views we&#39;ve had today. Not only that, the analytics show people stayed there, read it and watched the video, with the average time on the page at close to six minutes.&quot;</p>
