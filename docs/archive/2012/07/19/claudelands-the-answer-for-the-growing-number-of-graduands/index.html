<p>Claudelands the answer for the growing number of Waikato graduands?</p>
<p>The University of Waikato will trial Hamilton’s Claudelands Events Centre for its October graduation ceremonies.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says with the number of graduates increasing each year, the October trial will be used to see if Claudelands is a more suitable venue for future ceremonies.</p>
<p>Every year the university hosts graduation ceremonies at its marae on its Hamilton campus, at Tauranga, and at the Founders Theatre with multiple sessions catering for hundreds of graduands.</p>
<p>“From our point of view Claudelands could have a number of advantages for the future of university graduations,” says Professor Crawford.</p>
<p>“There is more on-site parking, it has a large covered area so bad weather is not an issue, and because of Claudelands’ size we will be able to have more family members attend graduations, which is what matters to the students.<br>“We always aim to deliver a flawless experience for our students, and Claudelands has a number of attributes that could make graduations even more enjoyable for students and their families.”</p>
<p>The traditional graduation parade through Hamilton city will still take place in October - from Civic Square, over the Claudelands Bridge and through to the Claudelands Events Centre.</p>
<p>A decision about the future of University of Waikato graduation ceremonies will be made after the 17 October ceremony. Two graduation ceremonies will be held that day.</p>
