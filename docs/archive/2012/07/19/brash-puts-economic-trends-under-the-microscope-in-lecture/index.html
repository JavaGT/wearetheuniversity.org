<p>Brash puts economic trends under the microscope in UC lecture</p>
<p>Well-known former New Zealand politician and former Governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr Don Brash, will be in Christchurch next week to take part in the University of Canterbury’s “What if Wednesday” lecture series.</p>
<p>The former Leader of the Opposition and of the ACT Party is the fifth speaker in the new, free weekly lecture series run by the University and will discuss the topic “What if recent economic trends were to continue?”</p>
<p>In it he plans to pull no punches as he explores a number of economic trends - New Zealand’s productivity growth, the government’s fiscal position and house prices relative to household incomes.</p>
<p>“I think we all understand that, unless these trends are reversed, the consequences will include very slow growth in real incomes for New Zealanders, a continuing exodus in search of higher incomes abroad, most obviously in Australia, rising government debt and rising house prices.”</p>
<p>But Dr Brash says his address will provide more than just a “reality check” for those concerned about New Zealand’s current economic directions. In addition, he will propose six fundamental policy changes which he believes are vital to prevent New Zealand becoming a quiet backwater.</p>
<p>He anticipates a lively question and answer section at the conclusion.</p>
<p>Who: Dr Don Brash</p>
<p>When: Wednesday 25 July, 6.30pm-8pm</p>
<p>Where: Undercroft, James Hight Building, University of Canterbury</p>
<p>ends  </p>
