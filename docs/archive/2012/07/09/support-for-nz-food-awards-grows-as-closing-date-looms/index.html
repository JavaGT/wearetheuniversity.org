<p>Support for NZ Food Awards grows as closing date looms</p>
<p>Support for the 2012 NZ Food Awards continues to grow with the signing of Countdown as a strategic partner and sponsor of the Grocer’s Choice Award.</p>
<p>With closing date looming on July 20, Countdown general manager for merchandise Murray Johnson says the competition is a great way for food and beverage producers to showcase their wares and highlight any innovations.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be a partner of the NZ Food Awards this year. As a leading grocery retailer, we are constantly on the look out for innovation in food and meeting our customers’ demand for new and exciting products. The NZ Food Awards is a great platform for local food and beverage producers and we are looking forward to seeing some high quality entries,” he says.</p>
<p>Countdown joins AsureQuality, Rabobank, the New Zealand Herald and KPMG alongside Massey University as strategic partners for the Awards.</p>
<p>The NZ Food Awards have a long history of recognising innovative products – from fruit leathers in 1987, to microwaveable cereals and spreadable butter – that consumers now take for granted.</p>
<p>KPMG has been a long-time supporter of the NZ Food Awards, and as sponsor of the Export Award, KPMG partner Ben van Delden thinks New Zealand food producers still have room to improve.</p>
<p>“While we recognise the importance of the food and beverage sector in this country, we believe New Zealand can and should be achieving more with our talent, knowledge, natural resources and market reputation,” he says. ”KPMG has a passionate commitment to helping our many innovative clients involved in the business of food succeed in global markets.”</p>
<p>Judging for the awards takes place in early August at Massey University’s Albany campus, and awards will be presented at a gala dinner on Thursday September 27 at The Langham Hotel in Auckland.</p>
<p>Award winners can market their success locally and globally by including the Awards quality mark on their products. Finalists and winners will have the opportunity to be mentored on aspects of product development by Rabobank, KPMG and Countdown.</p>
