<p>9 July 2012</p>
<p><strong>From opera to rugby – Waikato Winter Lecture Series</strong></p>
<p>Topics as diverse as rugby and opera will feature in this year’s University of Waikato Winter Lecture Series.</p>
<p>Dame Malvina Major will open the month-long series on August 1 with a mini master class on how to improve vocal technique. Later in the month, Wales rugby coach Warren Gatland, a University of Waikato alumnus, will talk about his rugby journey.</p>
<p>The Winter Lecture Series is an annual free public lecture series that runs every Wednesday 6-7pm in August.</p>
<p>University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says rather than having one over-arching theme for this year’s series, there are a variety of subjects. “The lectures have proved extremely popular in the past and they are an opportunity for the university to have its lecturers and key people from the community talking on subjects of topical interest so we can stimulate discussion and debate.”</p>
<p>Tainui Group Holdings CEO Mike Pohio will talk about the inland port plans for the city and he’ll be joined by Hamilton Mayor Julie Hardaker who’ll outline her vision Hamilton and the issues and challenges the city faces. That lecture will take place at the Novotel Tainui. The rest are on campus at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts.</p>
<p>Another lecture will cover sustainability in urban design – what’s important in rebuilding a city like Christchurch and what Hamilton needs to do to enhance urban design, and the series wraps up with a subject close to most people’s hearts – food, from paddock to plate. Professor of Agribusiness Jacqueline Rowarth will be joined by local chef, caterer and restaurateur David Kerr and Professor Darrin Hodgetts who researches issues around poverty and food insecurity.</p>
