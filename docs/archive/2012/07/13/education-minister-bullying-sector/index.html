<p><strong>Friday, 13 July 2012, 3:17 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Nanaia<br>MAHUTA<br>Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>13 July 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Education Minister bullying sector</strong></p>
<p>The Labour Party says it is disappointing the Education Minister prefers to bully teachers and principals, rather than listening to their advice about how best to teach kiwi kids.</p>
<p>Labour’s Education Spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta says &quot;It appears Hekia Parata has cautioned teachers and principals against using school newsletters to inform parents about the impact of Government policies, such as larger class sizes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;During that debate, principals took the rarely-used measure of detailing the adverse effect the Government’s plan would have had in their schools and on student’s learning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Education professionals were frustrated at the Minister’s rejection of their advice about the real impact of larger classes at a time of such constrained funding.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Hekia Parata chose to follow Treasury-led advice on a policy that would have had a negative impact on children&#39;s learning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now she is adopting bullying behaviour and trying to drive a wedge between parents and teachers.”</p>
<p>&quot;If the Minister continues down this path the only losers will be the children who deserve more and need a coherent set of policies that help them realise their full potential.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister should work with the sector constructively, support parents who want more for their children and be a role model for children who do not want more bullies in the school system.&quot;  </p>
