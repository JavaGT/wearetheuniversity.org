<p><strong>Tuesday, 3 April 2012, 12:33 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students'_Association">Otago University Students&#39; Association</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Students working 31% harder and earning 39% more</strong></p>
<p>Otago University students have earned over 2 million dollars in the three months since January 1st according to the latest statistics from Student Job Search.</p>
<p>“It just shows that students are hard working and earning money for their education,” said OUSA President Logan Edgar. “It’s not all parties, for students it’s about balance and we’re delighted our SJS service provides our students with the jobs they need.”</p>
<p>Official figures released this week show that while student placements were down, dollars earned, seeker enrolments, average earnings and the amount of time worked were up.</p>
<p>The OUSA Student Support team, who run the student food bank; hope the increases will mean a long run decrease in demand for the food bank.</p>
<p>“Our student food bank usage increased 64% in 2011,” Says Matt Tucker, OUSA Student Support Manager. “We’re hoping that 2012 will see students better off, and SJS is one of our services that can really help.”</p>
<p>“We reckon once people get into the new website <a href="http://www.sjs.co.nz">www.sjs.co.nz</a> and sort their timetables out a bit more we’ll see the numbers get even higher”, said Logan Edgar referring to the new SJS website launched over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>“We want to beat the magic 6 million dollar mark we set ourselves after our effort last year, and we’re off to a good start,” Logan Edgar said.</p>
