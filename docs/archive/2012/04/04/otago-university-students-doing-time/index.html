<p><strong>Wednesday, 4 April 2012, 4:07 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students'_Association">Otago University Students&#39; Association</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>For Immediate Release</strong></p>
<p><strong>Otago University Students Doing Time</strong></p>
<p>The Otago University Students’ Association is spearheading a move to get students giving back to the Dunedin community during a weeklong volunteering effort from the 16th-22nd of April.</p>
<p>“At OUSA’s core is providing the ultimate student experience.” Says OUSA welfare officer, Francisco Hernandez. “Students’ want to help out, and we’re providing a way for them to give back and show how much Dunedin means to us.”</p>
<p>“It’s not just a way to help the city we call home while were studying, but it’s a great way to meet new people, add something to your CV and step out of the student zone for a little while.” Says Shonelle Eastwood, OUSA Student Support Advocate.</p>
<p>OUSA is also running a food bank collection at the OUSA Market Day on the 19th of April. The aim is for those who don’t have the time to volunteer but have a spare can of baked beans or even a wee jar of Marmite, and want to do a little bit of good.</p>
<p>“It’s a bit of fun because we’re taking on the Vice Chancellor and her crew in the Staff versus Students food bank drive.” Says Hernandez. “But it’s all for a good cause, and not just for students as the food collected will go toward the Dunedin City Combined food bank.”</p>
<p>OUSA, thanks to Scarfie Card creator, Aaron Thomson is currently in talks with volunteer Otago, the SPCA and other organisations on a range of tasks including eco fencing on the Peninsula.</p>
<p>OUSA is calling for Dunedin organisations that need a bit of help for an hour or a day to get in touch about how their volunteers can help.</p>
