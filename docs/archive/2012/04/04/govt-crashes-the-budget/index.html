<p><strong>Govt crashes the budget</strong></p>
<p>The National Government’s poor budget management has led to a widening budget deficit with no good news in sight, the Green Party said.</p>
<p>Treasury numbers out today show that the operating deficit for the first eight months of the financial year was $5.5 billion (excluding losses and gains). This is $395 million worse than Treasury forecast six months ago. Core Crown tax revenue was $825 million lower than forecast. This shortfall is primarily due to weaker than expected income tax and corporate tax returns, and a below forecast GST take.</p>
<p>“The Government has crashed the revenue side of the Budget,” said Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman.</p>
<p>“The tax take continues to be lower than expected throwing its books deeper into deficit.</p>
<p>“The National Government are failing the basic task of fiscal prudence; it is like watching a slow moving train wreck.</p>
<p>“Tax revenues have been hit heavily due to the Government’s tax policy changes, weak economic activity, and on-going earthquake-related costs.</p>
<p>“John Key’s dismissal of a temporary earthquake levy has left him with few options when it comes to funding the spiralling cost of the Canterbury rebuild.</p>
<p>“The Government’s 2010 tax switch has done nothing to boost economic activity; it’s simply left a $11 billion hole (at least) in their books for no apparent gain.</p>
<p>“John Key’s insistence that his tax changes are ‘fiscally neutral’ is now starting to sound desperate.”</p>
<p>Inland Revenue’s Briefing to the Incoming Minister has highlighted that current Government policy was largely responsible for a dramatic 4.1 percent decline in tax revenues as a percentage of GDP.</p>

<p>“The National Government’s centrepiece tax shift isn’t delivering the kind of resilient economy they’d promised,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“The evidence for this is sharply declining tax revenues from businesses and workers.”</p>
<p>“The Green Party has set out a clear alternative plan to get the Government’s books back into surplus through a mix of reprioritised spending and new revenue streams.</p>
<p>“We can manage the government’s books in a fiscally responsible way without having to sell valuable assets or raise debt.”</p>
