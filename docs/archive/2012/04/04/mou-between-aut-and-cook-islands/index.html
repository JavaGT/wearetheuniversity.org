<p><strong>Official Signing Ceremony of Memorandum of Understanding between<br>Auckland University of Technology and the Government of the Cook Islands<br>at Auckland University of Technology’s Manukau Campus on 11 April 2012</strong></p>
<p>Auckland University of Technology’s (AUT) Vice-Chancellor, Derek McCormack and the Hon Teina Bishop, Minister of Education, Government of the Cook Islands, will sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) at AUT’s Manukau Campus on Wednesday 11 April.</p>
<p>The purpose of the MOU is to facilitate and promote co-operation between AUT and the Cook Islands through the collaborative development and promotion of educational opportunities for government officials, public servants and students in the South Pacific region. The MOU will provide opportunities for Cook Islands students to study part-time and full-time through AUT, with a particular emphasis on utilising indigenous research methods.</p>
<p>The MOU furthers AUT’s goal of 100 Pasifika PhDs by 2020, with five Cook Island PhD candidates currently studying at AUT. It will provide new study opportunities for New Zealand-based Cook Islands students studying at AUT, particularly in the areas of Pacific Arts, Pacific Development and Pacific Natural and Cultural Resource Management.</p>
<p>This agreement brings together the best attributes of both parties and is a great opportunity to contribute to the social and economic development of the Cook Islands and New Zealand.</p>
