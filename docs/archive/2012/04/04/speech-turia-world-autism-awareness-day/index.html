<p><strong>World Autism Awareness Day</strong><br><strong>Wednesday 4 April 2012, 7.30am</strong><br><strong>Parliament Buildings, Wellington</strong> <strong>Speech</strong></p>
<p>I am absolutely delighted to join with Autism New Zealand in this important event to celebrate World Autism Awareness Day.</p>
<p>I want to thank Glenys Fry – the President of Autism New Zealand; and Alison Molloy, the Chief Executive of Autism New Zealand for your invitation to speak with you today – and I welcome all of my parliamentary colleagues and our distinguished guests to this important event. It is a really good sign to see so many of you here, acknowledging the</p>
<p>It is right to firstly acknowledge the people with autism, their whānau and the champions for your commitment and your support for this awareness day breakfast.</p>
<p>Across the world various events are taking place this week to draw attention to autism and its impacts.</p>
<p>In Jakarta, more than one hundred children with autism will be gathering in the Bogor Botanical Gardens to celebrate the day<br>In New York, Vienna and Geneva six commemorative postage stamps are being released. The images featured have been created by artists with autism – sending a powerful message to people around the world that talent and creativity reside within us all.</p>
<p>The call across the globe is for a commitment to awareness; an awareness that autism is a lifelong neuro-cognitive condition that affects at least one per cent of people in New Zealand, and millions worldwide.</p>

<p>The opportunity to gather today and reflect on our work with and for people with autism provides us with the space in time, to consider the impact of autism on our lives, and to realise the potential and the opportunities that are a birthright for every child born.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I received a heartfelt letter from a young mum, entitled ‘<em>a mother’s plea for help’.</em> The letter chronicled a series of issues for her young son - the difficulties he found with unexpected change; his fascination in lining up stones and marbles, organising them by colour and size before he counted them; his intense focus on routine and particular clothing; and consistently challenging social behaviour.</p>
<p>At the end of her letter she told me of his career aspirations – his desire to be a veterinarian, a computer programmer, a butcher, dog trainer, games tester and a bull rider.</p>
<p>Her son had every right to dream; to think of the future he longed to participate in.</p>
<p>Yet, he was constantly sent home from school; stood down; suspended and excluded, on the basis of the behaviour he was demonstrating.</p>
<p>I believe that behaviour should never become an excuse for a lack of educational provision for children with special needs.</p>
<p>How can we ensure that people with autism are not suspended or expelled from school at the tender age of six or seven – what track are we sending our children down if we fail to explore their potential?</p>
<p>We want to see confident schools, confident parents and confident children – benefitting from inclusive practice in schools. The vision is Success for All.</p>
<p>I like that. I like the concept of supporting whānau to benefit from educational success; to support teachers and administrators to share information and increase the knowledge and most of all to keep the focus on supporting children and young people to be the best that they can be – and not just concentrating on a medical diagnosis.</p>
<p>I believe success is not just about acceptance and understanding – it is also about full participation – and what we need to do to achieve that.</p>
<p>Ultimately it is about choice, control and collaboration. It is around giving choice and control over the services they receive and the lives they live. But it is also about connecting all the dots – health, housing, justice, education, employment, social services.</p>
<p>This is a holistic approach - that means a whole of spectrum, whole of life, whole of government; whole of whānau approach.</p>
<p>I was interested in a recent PhD thesis from Hillary Stace entitled “<em>Moving beyond love and luck – building right relationships and respecting lived experience in New Zealand’s autism policy”.</em></p>
<p>In her research Hilary refers to the <em><strong>New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guidelines</strong></em> which were the first guideline in the world to take a holistic, best practice approach to the issues around autism. As part of her study she talked about the importance of people with autism being able to create their own solutions, as long as they have the right support – the legislation, the policy and of course their families and friends.</p>
<p>Government also must play a key role in supporting this goal, to enable the full range of skills, talents and wisdom of people along the spectrum to be recognised.<br>In many ways this is what I hope we will do with some of the new initiatives being pioneered in the disability sector.</p>
<p>One project is entitled the <strong>New model for supporting disabled people</strong> – it has a strong focus on using Local area co-ordinators to walk alongside disabled people and help them to plan the life the want to live. The model includes more use of self-assessment and individualised funding – to empower people to take control of their own lives. We’re trialling this model in the Bay of Plenty – particularly Tauranga.</p>
<p>Another focus is called <strong>Enabling Good Lives.</strong> This came about from asking people in the disability sector what sort of services they wanted around day services and community participation.</p>
<p>Their answer was clear –they wanted the flexibility to do everyday things in everyday places, rather than special activities in special venue.</p>
<p>This model is being tested in Canterbury – which was deliberately chosen because in the aftermath of the earthquake, everything has come up for re-examination.</p>
<p>In that space, it’s an ideal opportunity to think about how we want things to look. It is fertile ground for more innovative ways to put our commitment to the task of making a positive difference.</p>
<p>I know that one of the concerns for people with autism – and particularly for people with Asperger Syndrome - is whether they can access, and are eligible for these initiatives if they don’t have a corresponding intellectual disability.</p>
<p>My interest is always on how we can bring into being opportunities which can ensure all children and adults with autism can lead full and meaningful lives; and this may mean a greater effort in awareness and advocacy if we are truly to achieve an inclusive community.</p>
<p>Finally I want to mihi to Matt (Frost) for your inspiration; your compassion and your commitment.</p>
<p>In 2010 we allocated three million dollars over three years to a campaign to change attitudes towards disabled people and break down barriers that prevent them participating as equal citizens.</p>
<p>Autism NZ is a key social change partner in this campaign and the <em>Addressing Barriers to Employment</em> project which Matt has led, came out of this work.</p>
<p>Matt is blessed with a rare gift. He takes the time to listen. He thinks deeply about issues that concern all New Zealanders, through a disability lens and with a particular focus on people with ASD.</p>
<p>Matt was one of the graduates of the first ever Be. Leadership programme in 2011. This is a wonderful project which helps leaders channel their strengths into opportunities to serve the community.</p>
<p>Matt saw an opportunity to serve his community by harnessing the special fields of interest and focus that people with ASD have, in order to tackle their higher than average unemployment.</p>
<p>The project seeks to support people with ASD to fulfil their potential in employment, and to support social change through positive role modelling. This is done by providing a mentor, who has ASD and is working, to a jobseeker with ASD. It is a wonderful example of how important it is to develop our leaders, and tap into the wisdom and experience of people with ASD to come up with solutions that work for themselves.</p>
<p>I want to thank you Matt, for giving voice to the issues of autism; for reminding us of the prejudice and discrimination that still faces so many; and for your constant practice of accentuating the positive.</p>
<p>We have made so much progress through our investment in the Disability Action Plan; our implementation of the <em>United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</em>, and the particular policies such as the New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline.</p>
<p>But all the plans in the world can only be successful if there is the will to abide by them.</p>
<p>I want to knowledge everyone here today, as political champions and advocates, who can help to bring awareness around autism, and to do what you can to foster an inclusive and caring society.</p>
