<p>Clare Curran<br>Labour MP for Dunedin South</p>
<p>13 April 2012</p>
<p><strong>Women keeping the Spirit alive</strong></p>
<p>Keeping the spirit alive, both literally and figuratively, is behind a move by Dunedin’s past and present women MPs.</p>
<p>Labour’s Clare Curran, Green Party co-leader Metiria Turei and former MP Katherine Rich, are urging the region’s women to donate what they can to bolster the coffers of the Otago women’s rugby team, the Spirit.</p>
<p>“The NZRFU, despite this week posting a $13.4million profit, has said it will support the Spirit, but not financially,” Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>“The state of the Otago rugby union is due to years of mismanagement and bad decisions, some of which the NZRFU should take some responsibility for.</p>
<p>“Women don&#39;t just make the scones or stand on the side-lines at rugby games any more. They play the game and should be encouraged,” Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>“Members of the Spirit are plucky and they are hugely enthusiastic. The team has produced some outstanding players, many of whom have gone on to represent New Zealand.”</p>
<p>Ms Curran said she had written to a range of prominent women and women’s organisations seeking their support.</p>
<p>“If we work together I am sure we can stump up with what&#39;s needed to keep the Spirit alive this season.</p>
<p>“I am donating $300, and when contacted today both Katherine Rich and Metiria Turei offered to contribute similar amounts. It’s a good start,” Clare Curran said.</p>
