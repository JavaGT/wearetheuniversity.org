<p>Media Release – 26 April 2012</p>
<p><strong>Vote By Students To Remove Craccum Editor Fails</strong></p>
<p>Students at the University of Auckland attended a Special General Meeting to consider the motion of no confidence in the editor of the student magazine, Craccum.</p>
<p>The motion failed affirming support from the student body for Thomas Dykes to remain as Editor of Craccum 2012. Final count of the vote was 144 against the motion to 83 for the motion with 10 abstentions<br>.<br>After one hour of robust debate, voting was taken by a division where those for and against the motion stood at separate sides of the AUSA Quad.</p>
<p>&quot;The discussion at the SGM was good, with plenty of time to hear views from all sides,&quot; says Arena Williams, President of the Auckland University Students’ Association.</p>
<p>“There is nothing radical about a radical student magazine,” said Thomas Dykes, Craccum Editor urging students at the SGM to contribute a broader range of content. “I’m not going to write your right wing articles for you. You write them, I’ll publish them.”</p>
<p>The SGM ended on a hopeful note with a handshake between Thomas Dykes, Craccum Editor and Kirk Jacinto, the student behind the SGM.</p>
