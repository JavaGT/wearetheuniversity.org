<p>16 April 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Progress can be made on paid parental leave</strong></p>
<p>Labour has today begun working with political leaders to progress moves to extend the paid parental leave scheme which invests in the wellbeing of Kiwi mums, dads and their babies. Says Labour Leader David Shearer.</p>
<p>“I’ve spoken personally to most of the other leaders in Parliament and am encouraged by their positive attitude towards the possible extension of the scheme. I am hopeful that we can continue to work together to come up with a solution that will see families benefit from an improved scheme at a cost that is acceptable to taxpayers.</p>
<p>The Bill’s promoter, Sue Moroney, says she is hearted by the support the Bill is receiving from across the political spectrum, which reflects the support it is getting from the community.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is lagging behind many other countries, including Australia, when it comes to paid parental leave. It is vital that parents can spend time with their babies. Labour’s plan would give thousands of families more time to do that,” said Sue Moroney.</p>
<p>David Shearer has today also written to Acting Prime Minister Bill English inviting him to take part in the debate.</p>
<p>“I look forward to hearing from him given he has told media that he would welcome a ‘conversation’ about the issue.</p>
<p>“This issue is too important to be ruled out this early in the debate. Supporting a child in their early years is the best investment we can make in their future. We should take the time to debate the issue and look for ways to make it work.</p>
<p>“There will be a cost to any extension. We accept that and we are prepared to compromise so that we come up with options that we can afford,” he said.</p>
