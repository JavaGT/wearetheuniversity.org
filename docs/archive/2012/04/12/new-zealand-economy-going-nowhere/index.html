<p><strong>Thursday, 12 April 2012, 2:25 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>David Cunliffe<br>Economic Development Spokesperson</p>
<p>12 April 2012</p>
<p><strong>New Zealand economy going nowhere</strong></p>
<p>Latest data shows New Zealand’s economy is still struggling to claw its way out of an extended rut, Labour&#39;s Economic Development spokesperson David Cunliffe says.</p>
<p>“Statistics NZ today revealed total <a href="http://www.stats.govtnz/browse_for_stats/businesses/business_characteristics/ElectronicCardTransactions_MRMar12.aspx">electronic card transactions are down 0.2</a> per cent and <a href="http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/industry_sectors/accommodation/AccommodationSurvey_MRFeb12.aspx">tourism guest nights are down 2 per</a> cent, with international arrivals down in both Islands, reflecting four straight years of decline for tourism receipts.</p>
<p>“On top of that the NZ Institute of Economic Research published its highly regarded <a href="http://nzier.org.nz/media/new-zealand%E2%80%99s-crab-like-recovery-continues-quarterly-survey-of-business-opinion-april-2012-med">Quarterly Survey of Business Opinion</a> (QSBO) this week. That showed a ‘crab-like recovery’ of an economy ‘going sideways’,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>&quot;NZIER&#39;s findings are disturbing. Trading activity of firms is flat - at 0 per cent - and there has been no acceleration in the recovery over the last nine months.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a worrying absence of business investment. Investment intentions are down in line with capacity pressures. This is hardly surprising with an exchange rate that is consistently overvalued and the lack of a credible government economic growth plan.</p>

<p>&quot;At the same time there are predictable but mounting labour and housing shortages in Canterbury, which alongside the standoff between EQC and insurers, is hugely debilitating for the earthquake rebuild.</p>
<p>&quot;Business and Economic Research Ltd’s (Berl) latest forecasts show the economy is ‘in a holding pattern at best, or at worst a double dip recession’. They warn of a ‘two speed economy’ with declining export performance, falling commodity prices and tourism receipts and further delays in Christchurch; offset against a rent-driven housing surge in Auckland.</p>
<p>&quot;Isn&#39;t this precisely the kind of rollercoaster the government said it would get us off?</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand needs a credible plan for growth and jobs that builds on our unique natural resource base and talented, innovative people,&quot; David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>&quot;Three and a half years into this sorry Government and Kiwis are still waiting for one.”</p>
