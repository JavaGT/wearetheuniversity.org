<p><strong>Wednesday, 11 April 2012, 10:00 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/You_Are_UC">You Are UC</a></strong></p>
<p>UC students oppose cuts</p>
<p>A student coalition has formed to oppose the cuts to University of Canterbury programmes. &quot;You Are UC&quot; condemns the consultation process, as university management has still failed to release to students the details of their proposed changes. Leaked copies of the change proposal raise serious doubts about the strength of the business case, and the integrity of the consultation. We call on the university to abandon this flawed process and follow their own Blue Book guidleines for disestablishing a course: consultation before everything else. This means timely provision to students of all consultation documents, and the creation of a valid business case.</p>
<p>A full range of tertiary options are vital to the future of Christchurch, both to attract students to study in the city and to support a vibrant civic culture. The funding shortfall UC faces as a result of earthquake damage means that this will only be the first round of cuts - and the poor process followed sets a bad precedent for the next round.</p>
<p>The cuts, supposedly meant to save money, are based on short-term costs incurred in the wake of last year&#39;s earthquakes and ignore the net profits the courses are making: so instead of saving money they are cutting into the university&#39;s long-term profits. They also ignore the loss of fees as students move to other universities that can support their studies.</p>
<p>You Are UC is arranging support for students to take part in the consultation process, is organising a petition presenting our demands to university management, and planning protest actions around the end of the month.</p>
