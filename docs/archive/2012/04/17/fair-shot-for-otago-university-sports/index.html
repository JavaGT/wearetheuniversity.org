<p>Fair Shot for Otago University Sports</p>
<p>Otago University students walked away with a podium finish at the University Games competition held in Wellington over the mid semester break, but that wasn&#39;t the only reason the team had their heads held high after the finish. The team was awarded the Fair Play award having been exceptional sports.</p>
<p>“We sent a small, high quality team who played hard and fair and did us proud to get us the bronze and pick up the coveted Fair Play Award”, said Logan Edgar OUSA President.</p>
<p>Team Otago&#39;s results are as below:</p>
<p>Netball</p>
<p>Played the minor semi Friday morning against Auckland winning 65 - 27 which secured a spot in Grand Final against AUT losing 60 – 30. In the first 3 quarters both teams were evenly placed on scoreboard, but Otago blew out in 4th quarter. The final score certainly didn&#39;t represent the closeness of the game.</p>
<p>The girls played very well throughout the tournament and were rewarded with five players being selected for the tournament team. They were Jamie Robertson, Rachel Carr, Rebecca Purvis, Tammy Sheehy and Ngareka Bensemann.</p>
<p>Badminton</p>
<p>Our team went on to claim the gold medal beating AUT in the final, an outstanding result.</p>
<p>Touch</p>
<p>With play cancelled on Thursday the remaining four round robin games were played, with the two top teams on points contesting the final at end of the round robin. Otago Blue which went through dropping the one game and finishing second, went on to play AUT (who finished unbeaten) in the final. The final was closely contested with AUT closing out the game 9 - 7 in the last minute. Again other outstanding result.</p>
<p>Team Otago reached the finals in the four sports OUSA contested at the Uni Games, taking home 1 gold and 3 silver medals.</p>
