<p>Lack of scrutiny of Solid Energy’s underground coal fire</p>
<p>It is unacceptable that Solid Energy’s underground coal gasification project which involves lighting coal on fire underground – lacks independent monitoring, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>Solid Energy announced yesterday that their $22 million underground coal gasification (UCG) pilot plant near Huntley is now operational. This means the company has set fire to a coal seam approximately 350 metres below ground in order to create synthetic gas.</p>
<p>“We think it is unacceptable that there is no independent monitoring of this dangerous new technique for exploiting coal in New Zealand,” said Green Party energy spokesperson Gareth Hughes.</p>
<p>“The coal seam on fire at the UCG plant near Huntley is a mere 300 metres from the Tauranga Group aquifer, and the regional council is not testing this aquifer for contamination.</p>
<p>“The regulator of this pilot project Waikato Regional Council is entirely reliant on water quality data collected and collated by Solid Energy themselves.</p>
<p>“As we have seen in Australia, we can’t count on industry to monitor itself rigorously and report when contamination happens.”</p>
<p>In Australia, Carbon Energy Ltd. failed to notify authorities when it spilled toxic process water at its UCG plant in Queensland in 2009. A second UCG plant in Queensland was forced to shut in July of last year, when cancer-causing chemicals were found in nearby groundwater.</p>
<p>“The UCG process is clearly risky and yet the New Zealand public has been denied its say on the implementation of this experimental technology near Huntley,” said Mr Hughes.</p>
<p>The consents for Solid Energy’s UCG proposal were non-notified.</p>
<p>“The public should be given access to all the information about these risky energy techniques and allowed a say,” said Mr Hughes.</p>
<p>“New Zealand doesn&#39;t need to resort to high risk technologies like underground coal gasification, which could wreck our clean green brand, when we have a wealth of smart green renewable energy opportunities that will deliver real prosperity.”</p>
