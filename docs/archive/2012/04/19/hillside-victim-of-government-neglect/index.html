<p>Clare<br>CURRAN<br>MP for Dunedin South</p>
<p>19 April 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Hillside victim of government neglect</strong></p>
<p>A deliberate campaign to make Kiwirail’s Hillside workshops commercially defunct has resulted in the sale of a valuable national asset, says Labour MP for Dunedin South Clare Curran.</p>
<p>“The decision to privatise Hillside, which Kiwirail will have made in consultation with the government, is the final in a series of moves which undermined the ability of the workshops to operate effectively.</p>
<p>“The National government must be held accountable,” Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>“National talks of prioritising jobs where costly convention centres in Auckland are at stake, but highly skilled railway workers in Dunedin have never been courted in the same way.</p>
<p>“This decision will affect more than 130 jobs, and around 75 Dunedin engineering businesses clustered around Hillside.</p>
<p>“National, has ignored the community who petitioned in their thousands for the workshops to be retained, and without any public consultation.</p>
<p>“Put simply, this is another asset sale from National. It represents the loss of another strategic asset which employed a loyal and skilled workforce.</p>
<p>“The decision not to bid for the $500 million contract for Auckland’s high speed rail, instead outsourcing contracts to China, can be seen as a precursor for today’s announcement.</p>
<p>“Hillside is hugely valuable part of Kiwirail’s infrastructure. This move is irresponsible and will have a negative impact on our infrastructure and workforce.</p>

<p>“If National was serious about getting New Zealanders into work they would promote policies that have the interest of all of Kiwis at heart.</p>
<p>“Labour has long promoted a home-grown procurement policy to use major government contracts to back New Zealand firms instead of exporting jobs offshore.</p>
<p>“Today is another sorry example of a government bereft of ideas of how to grow the economy apart from selling off our future,” Clare Curran said.</p>
