<p><strong>Volunteer work leads to a new career direction</strong></p>
<p>There aren’t many graduating teachers who can tell their students they used to have a giraffe in the back yard.</p>
<p>University of Waikato graduand Amondi Ouku-Mowbray is looking forward to sharing her story and teaching children about difference and different cultures.</p>
<p>Originally from Kenya, Amondi graduates with a Bachelor of Teaching in early childhood education at Hamilton’s Founders Theatre on May 1.</p>
<p>As well as studying, Amondi has been working with children since she came to New Zealand in 2006.</p>
<p>She has been a volunteer for GirlGuiding New Zealand as a Pippin leader in Cambridge, taught preschool children at Country Crèche in Matangi and has worked with Congolese and Somali refugee families in Hamilton.</p>
<p>“When I came to New Zealand from Africa I began doing social work and working with kids and saw I could contribute more when working with children.</p>
<p>“The volunteer work enabled me to interact a lot with Kiwi children and their parents which has been a big plus for me in learning about my new country. I bring my story from Africa, like how back home I had a giraffe that would come to the back of my property and eat the leaves off the trees.</p>
<p>“I’ve found when you want to impact change it’s best to start with children. Children are so naturally inquisitive, aren’t as inhibited as adults and have such a thirst for information.”</p>
<p>It was through volunteer work that Amondi decided to study early childhood education.</p>
<p>Studying at Waikato has made Amondi understand how loss of language can lead to loss of culture and inspired her to study more about Kenyan history.</p>
<p>“The Bachelor of Teaching degree at Waikato is quite unique as it included applied cultural studies, which has motivated me to learn more about my culture.”</p>
