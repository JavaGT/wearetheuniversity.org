<p>19 April 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Alarm at welfare reform process</strong></p>
<p>An almost unanimous call for the Government to slow down its welfare reforms threatened to become the major issue of a Social Services Select Committee meeting today, according to Labour’s spokesperson for Social Development Jacinda Ardern and Labour committee members Rajen Prasad and Sua William Sio.</p>
<p>“With 11 days to produce a submission on these reforms, it’s easy to see why submitters from church organisations like Caritas through to the Law Society, have expressed their major concerns over the Government’s truncated timeline.</p>
<p>“The Law Society rightly pointed out that the Minister can’t have it both ways – either her changes are significant and deserve decent analysis or consideration or they’re not and can be rushed through.</p>
<p>“Ironically, some submitters from Auckland were unable to attend the one day they were allocated for their submission to be heard because they were at a conference Paula Bennett was due to speak at,” Jacinda Ardern said.</p>
<p>“In case she has therefore missed the overwhelming message my colleagues and I have written to her to ask that she reopen submissions and give this debate the time it deserves.</p>
<p>“This isn’t ‘just some little project’, but, to quote the Government, is ‘part of a comprehensive package of welfare reform’. The changes will affect thousands of young people, sole parents and those on Widow’s and Women Alone benefits and, most importantly, children.</p>
<p>“If this area of policy isn’t worth more time, debate, and focus from Parliament, then I truly question the Minister’s priorities”</p>
