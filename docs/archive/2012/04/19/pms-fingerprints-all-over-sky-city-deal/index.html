<p>19 April 2012 Media Statement</p>
<p><strong>PM’s Fingerprints All Over Sky City Deal</strong></p>
<p>Labour has evidence that shows the Prime Minister directly intervened in the process and instructed officials to stop work on a business plan for a Convention Centre when a possible deal with Sky City was floated.</p>
<p>“Documents obtained by Labour show that a joint feasibility study for a new convention centre was carried out by the Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Tourism and the Auckland City Council in August 2009,” Labour Leader David Shearer says.</p>
<p>“Officials recommended developing a further business case and John Key, as Minister of Tourism, was briefed on that.</p>
<p>“At the same time John Key was also made aware of Sky City’s plans to expand its own convention facilities. He then called an immediate halt to further work on a business case.</p>
<p>“Three months later, in November 2009, John Key has dinner with casino bosses where he admitted having discussed the centre and ‘issues relating to the gambling act’ - clearly sealing the deal.</p>
<p>“This raises questions about the extent of John Key’s dealings with Sky City.</p>
<p>“Selling our legislation to a casino in exchange for hundreds of pokie machines is shocking behaviour for a Prime Minister,” David Shearer said.</p>
<p>“He directly intervened in the process and agreed to a deal with Sky City almost a year before Cabinet finally decided to call for expressions of interest, in 2010.</p>

<p>“The entire process, which has cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars, appears to have been just a smokescreen to cover up the fact a deal had already been done.</p>
<p>“This deal has been anything but transparent. This looks like a secret deal was done behind taxpayers’ backs. It will cause harm to New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“It is no surprise that Sky City emerged victorious from the tender process because it was a one-horse race from the start,” David Shearer said.</p>
<p>“It’s time John Key put his cards on the table, and showed New Zealanders exactly what has gone on behind the scenes.”</p>
