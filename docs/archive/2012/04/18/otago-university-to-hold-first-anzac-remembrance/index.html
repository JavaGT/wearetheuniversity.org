<p><strong>Otago University to Hold First ANZAC Remembrance</strong></p>
<p>This Anzac Day the OUSA along with the Otago University will be holding a special ANZAC remembrance, the first of its kind on the campus.</p>
<p>“It is going to be very special and unlike any other around Otago in that it will focus on opening the service to the next generation of our young people” said Logan Edgar, OUSA President</p>
<p>The 1.30pm service on April 25th is driven by the young student who believes that this is a generation that wants to remember those who fought for the future of their families and their country.</p>
<p>“This is about remembering and thanking those who stepped up, left their families and travelled across the globe to risk their lives for the sake of others” said Edgar. “It’s about sacrifice, remembrance and hope. That’s something we need to be thankful for, and it’s an honour to hold an ANZAC service on campus.”</p>
<p>The service, which has been added to the RSA’s official list of events for the day, will be held on the Memorial Walk for students who fought in the Great War. The path runs along the water of Leith in front of the university registry’s clock tower, with a plaque marking the entrance to the walk from the Leith Bridge in central campus.</p>
<p>“It’s such an iconic path. Students and staff walk it every day and it’s used in promotion around the world, yet only a few know the meaning it holds” says Edgar. “We want to highlight the path so when people walk it they can do so with meaning, especially remembering those ANZAC’s from our own University who fought and gave their lives.”</p>

<p>A piper will welcome attendees and Mr. Edgar will begin the service with Lisa Pohatu, Tumuaki, of Te Roopu Maori. University Chaplain Greg Hughson will share the opening prayer. During the service there will be a gun salute, the last post and one minute’s silence. Vice Chancellor Harlene Hayne will share a reading, and the speaker will be Lt. Colonel Mike Hunter.</p>
<p>The ceremony will be concluded by the laying of the wreaths by University staff and OUSA representatives.</p>
<p>All students, staff and public are welcome to attend and partake in refreshments after the completion of the service.</p>
