<p>Ross<br>Robertson<br>MP for Manukau East</p>
<p>Friday 27 April 2012 Media Statement  </p>
<p><strong>Stand Up For The South, MP Tells Future Leaders</strong>  </p>
<p>MP for Manukau East, Ross Robertson, today challenged a group of leaders from Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate Senior School in Otara, to prove wrong the public’s negative perceptions of South Auckland.</p>
<p>“In my role as an MP representing the south, one of the things that saddens me most is the all-too-frequent misrepresentation of South Auckland,” Ross Robertson said.</p>
<p>“In the media and across Auckland, we get a bad rap, but in fact we have some of the best and brightest minds, schools and future leaders in all of New Zealand.</p>
<p>“It is my challenge to these students to prove those perceptions wrong. They are our future and have the potential to turn South Auckland’s reputation around.</p>
<p>“The recent visit to Ferguson Intermediate by principals, professors and teachers from around the world is a case in point. The visitors, as part of Microsoft’s Partners in Learning network conference, had high praise for the school’s learning environment and facilities, proving again that the south has the potential to be a world leader.</p>
<p>“When Otara wins New Zealand wins - it is important to challenge and change those perceptions, and I believe each and every young person can make a difference.</p>
<p>“Leaders are compasses, not weather vanes, and do not let anyone else define who they are.</p>
<p>“Today I challenge these young people to go out, get educated, be themselves, be strong, and be tomorrow’s leaders in whatever field they choose,” said Ross Robertson.  </p>
