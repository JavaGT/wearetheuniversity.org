<p>Community Wins in Battle Between Staff and Students</p>
<p>The Otago University Students&#39; Association had a battle on their hands when taking on the Otago University staff in a food bank collection competition yesterday.</p>
<p>&quot;There may have been some humorous and questionable tactics by both sides, but the winner in the end was the Dunedin Community Food Banks!&quot; said Shonelle Eastwood, OUSA Student Support Centre advocate, &quot;The students took it out, but only just as for a while there the staff had us pipped.&quot;</p>
<p>The final collection tally was; Students, 153.5kg with 396 items collected, and Staff, 148.3kg with 344 items collected.</p>
<p>&quot;The Vice Chancellor really got behind the idea and it showed in the great turn out by staff, and we&#39;re just so stoked the students were up for the challenge and won in the end,&quot; said Logan Edgar, OUSA President, &quot;Our food bank itself is heavily used, blowing the budget last year, so we&#39;re really glad students were able to spare a can here and there for the people of Dunedin.&quot;</p>
<p>The event is part of a wider OUSA Volunteer week, encouraging students with spare time to volunteer for a number of tasks listed by community groups around Dunedin. All food collected will be donated to the Dunedin community combined food banks with the inaugural competition aimed at giving back to the city.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve done something like this so we hope to build on it each year as students and the community become more aware of the week,&quot; said Miss. Eastwood.</p>
