<p>Problem gambling expert commends Mayor’s rethink on SkyCity expansion</p>
<p>Auckland Mayor Len Brown should be commended for his change of stance on SkyCity’s proposed national convention centre says Professor Max Abbott, director of AUT University’s Gambling and Addictions Research Centre.</p>
<p>Professor Abbott supports Mr Brown&#39;s call for a sinking lid policy for pokies in clubs and pubs; an independent cost-benefit analysis and tougher harm minimisation requirements if SkyCity casino is allowed to increase its poker machines and table games.</p>
<p>&quot;From a public health perspective it is better to fund the convention centre some other way. However, if it&#39;s a done deal it will be important to take other steps to reduce the very substantial financial, health and social harms that are associated with these forms of gambling.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Abbott says non-casino pokies are more heavily concentrated in deprived neighbourhoods. Research shows that living closer to gambling venues is associated with increased participation and greater risk of problem gambling.</p>
<p>“The latest National Health Survey found that half of all problem gamblers lived in the 20% most deprived areas in the country and that Maori and Pacific people are at much greater risk.”</p>
<p>&quot;Problem gamblers are just the tip of the iceberg of gambling-related harm. Each problem gambler has an adverse impact on many people around them as well as on wider society through criminal activity, work absenteeism and health and social service costs. In addition to problem gamblers, there are many more people who experience lower levels of problems that, in total, outweigh the harms and costs associated with those at the more serious end of the spectrum.&quot;</p>

<p>According to Professor Abbott gambling follows and deepens existing lines of social inequality and increases health disparities across ethnic and socio-economic groups.</p>
<p>“There is a significant ethical issue involved in funding major capital developments, or community and sports organisations, from the losses of people who are marginalised and on low incomes,” he says.</p>
<p>In the event that the convention centre deal goes through, there could be a trade-off by Council or Government imposing a sinking lid policy that brings total pokie numbers down below what they are presently and redistributes them away from marginalised neighbourhoods. SkyCity and other casinos could also be required to introduce more effective prevention and harm minimisation procedures such as pre-commitment and detection of at-risk and problem gamblers through electronic monitoring, as well as more rigorous policing of current measures including self- and patron-exclusion.</p>
