<p><strong>Chocolate egg’s rise to Easter treasure</strong></p>
<p>Chocolate eggs are part of an Easter tradition for many New Zealanders, but the Easter egg has a long history dating back at least 2,500 years, says Massey University historian Professor Susan Mumm.</p>
<p>The painted or dyed egg goes back at least 2,500 years into the pre-Christian era. Eggs were used to celebrate fertility, the arrival of spring, and to symbolise new life.</p>
<p>By the Middle Ages coloured eggs were found in a wide range of countries and customs rapidly developed around them which continue today, she says.</p>
<p>Professor Mumm says many people will remember childhood traditions of colouring hen’s eggs, hunting for eggs or even egg-rolling competitions. Today, beeping eggs are designed for visually impaired children to hunt.</p>
<p>But now children associate the Easter egg with a foil-wrapped chocolate rather than a poultry product.</p>
<p>Professor Mumm, Pro Vice-Chancellor of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, says the transformation began slowly, probably in the 18th Century in France, Germany and Belgium with sporadic production of small hand-made chocolates shaped like eggs, designed as luxury Easter gifts. But in 1873 this all began to change.</p>
<p>“The chocolate egg began its journey to global phenomenon when the British chocolate manufacturer Cadbury’s began mass-producing chocolate Easter eggs as a way of expanding their product line,” Professor Mumm says.</p>
<p>The development of food technologies that made chocolate a more stable product made this possible, and while there are no available details of Cadbury’s sales figures for this period, we can infer the new product was extremely popular, she says.</p>

<p>“Within a few years a wide range of eggs were being advertised and competitors were entering the field. In 1897 milk chocolate was developed, allowing an even wider range of choice.”</p>
<p>Professor Mumm says despite temporary setbacks during wartime and post-war rationing, the chocolate egg has become a fixture in many parts of the world. Many 21st century children probably assume the “real” Easter egg is made of chocolate.</p>
<p>“And when did the chocolate Easter animal (chicken, bunny, action figure, you name it) appear? Further research is needed!”</p>
