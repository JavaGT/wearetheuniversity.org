<p><strong>Cats and lilies a toxic mix</strong></p>
<p>A Massey University veterinary researcher is warning people that lilies, popular at Easter, can be deadly to cats.</p>
<p>Dr Kathleen Parton, from the Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences, had published widely on toxicology in animals.</p>
<p>She says lilies of the <em>Lilium</em> and <em>Hemerocallis</em> genus, which includes the Easter, Christmas and Stargazer lilies, are potentially deadly to cats.</p>
<p>“Cats have a tendency to eat the flowers or leaves of these lilies,” Dr Parton says. “But they’re very poisonous and cats can then develop acute renal failure very quickly.”</p>
<p>Even brushing past a plant is dangerous, as pollen can rub off on the fur, then can be eaten. “Drinking the water the plant is in can also lead to poisoning,” she says.</p>
<p>If an owner suspects their cat has been poisoned, it is important to seek help from a veterinarian immediately.</p>
<p>“The first 18 hours are critical, without treatment the cat will begin to drink a lot of water, indicating kidney failure, and die within a few days,” she says. “Early signs of poisoning include vomiting, not eating and depression, which appear within a few hours of eating the lily.”</p>
<p>Dr Parton says if at all possible, keep lilies away from cats entirely.</p>
