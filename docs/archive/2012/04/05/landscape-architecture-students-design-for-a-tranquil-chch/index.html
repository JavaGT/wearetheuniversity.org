<p><strong>Lincoln University Landscape Architecture Students Design For A ‘Tranquil’ Christchurch</strong></p>
<p>Over the past year Lincoln University landscape architect students have played a valuable role in the earthquake recovery. Students have been involved in community projects such as the Re:START mall project and Greening the Rubble sites.</p>
<p>Lincoln University’s second-year landscape architecture students have now teamed up with Healthy Christchurch and Christchurch’s Māori, Pacific and ethnic communities to create six serene gardens - <em>Places of Tranquillity –</em> at demolition sites across Christchurch.</p>
<p>“A key element of the Lincoln University landscape architecture degree is the applied community-based projects undertaken to provide real-world experience that is invaluable in the transition to professional employment” says Landscape Architecture Senior Lecturer Mike Barthelmeh.</p>
<p>“There are six students in each group and they will individually come up with a design concept for one of the planned gardens that will be presented to the community. The students will have to consider not just the physical landscape but also the traditions, culture and social needs of the community they are designing for. The community will then decide on the final design for each of the six sites and volunteers including the students will help construct the gardens.</p>
<p>“The skills the students are currently learning at this time will serve them and the national and international communities in which they will be working in extremely well in the future”.</p>
