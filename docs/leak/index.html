Leaking information exposes wrongdoing, promote transparency, and holds our institutions accountable. </p>
<p>Leaking information have risks, including legal consequences and personal repercussions. However there are strategies to mitigate discovery or allow others to take the burden.</p>
<p>Quick tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leaking doesn&#39;t always have to be secret information, it can just be something that is not widely known, or not known to the right people.</li>
<li>Leaks from staff are one of the only ways students can find out what is happening in their institution (AUSA doesn&#39;t share much).</li>
<li>Do not use work email or devices to leak information.</li>
<li>You can use social media, forums, or email to leak information, but be cautious of metadata or connections to your online identity.</li>
<li>Use of <a href="https://fyi.org.nz">Official Infomation Act (OIA)</a> requests can expose information and protect the leaker.</li>
<li>You are welcome to meet up in person to share information.</li>
<li>Verify the accuracy of the information before leaking. Inaccurate information can undermine credibility and cause harm.</li>
<li>Alternatively provide the limitations of your knowledge or the information you are sharing - rumor is okay if it is clear that it is a rumor, this can impower us to investigate further.</li>
