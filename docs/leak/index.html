Leaking information exposes wrongdoing, promotes transparency, and holds our institutions accountable. </p>
<p>Leaking information has risks, including legal consequences and personal repercussions. However there are strategies to mitigate discovery or allow others to bear the burden.</p>
<p>Quick tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Leaking doesn&#39;t always have to be secret information, it can just be something that is not widely known, or not known to the right people.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Leaks from staff are one of the only ways students can find out what is happening in their institution.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Do not use work email or devices to leak information.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>You can use social media, forums, or email to leak information, but be cautious of metadata or connections to your online identity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use of <a href="https://fyi.org.nz">Official Infomation Act (OIA)</a> requests can expose information and protect the leaker.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You are welcome to meet up in person to share information.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Verify the accuracy of the information before leaking. Inaccurate information can undermine credibility and cause harm.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Alternatively, describe the limitations of or your confidence in the information you are sharing - rumor is okay if it is clear that it is a rumor, this can impower us to investigate further.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you&#39;d like for us to also not know who you are, you can use a disposable email address, social media account, and/or a pseudonym.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s a lot to consider. If you would like help be in touch with us and let us know that you have information to leak, but would like assistance doing so safely.</p>
