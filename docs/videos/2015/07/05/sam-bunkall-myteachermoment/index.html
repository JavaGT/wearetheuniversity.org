Then, along came an amazing drama teacher, named Ricky, who completely changed the way people thought about drama. Sam says, “up until Ricky arrived we had just sort of done plays, but he really got us to think critically about theatre and all the different kinds of theatre around the world. He inspired this community of people who felt like they finally belonged”.<br><br>What’s your teacher moment?
