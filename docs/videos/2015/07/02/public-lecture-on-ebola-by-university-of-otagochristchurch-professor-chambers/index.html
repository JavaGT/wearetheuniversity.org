style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening ladies and gentlemen my<br>name is Peter choice for those who<br>only on Dean at University of Otago<br>Christchurch and it's my pleasure to<br>cheer these public lectures this is the<br>third in a series of six for this year<br>and tonight's lecture has been given by<br>one about senior professors / Professor<br>Steve chambers who's in the department<br>of pathology he said a joint appointment<br>with a dhp for many many years now in<br>for a long time he was hit up in<br>pictures diseases for the Canterbury<br>District Health Board so tonight he's<br>going to talk about Ebola one year on<br>hmm thank you Peter yeah well thank you<br>for coming along this evening it's<br>really nice to see you here and I've<br>prepared some the two here for you and I<br>not ought to give the sure of the level<br>of knowledge we have sold I'll keep it<br>pretty simple so and at the end of you<br>want some clarity about things i have<br>very happy to take some questions so<br>just what we intend to do a description<br>of the epidemic and where it's got to a<br>bit of history about the Ebola and<br>commenting on the fact that well-known<br>control measures will work well if<br>implemented effectively comment on the<br>international efforts which have been<br>far too slow I'll give you a description<br>of a clinical description of a bowler in<br>its management and the importance of the<br>local culture and sensibilities and and<br>putting in a relevant infection control<br>program discuss briefly the impact on<br>medical and nursing staff and comment<br>briefly on the van der vaccines and<br>treatments and give an idea of the road<br>map that'sa headers put out by wh 0<br>sorry what about the current situation I<br>think everyone he knows who's read the<br>newspapers who looked at the news that<br>this epidemic began in West Africa and<br>December of 2013 there's a young<br>two-year-old boy Emil who became unwell<br>Elizabeth in this village other people<br>help look after him and in a spread very<br>rapidly to capital cities and this was<br>an<br>before an Ebola and from there has<br>spread to other urban areas across the<br>borders into neighboring countries but<br>very early on mids and some from tears<br>was notified and they started to raise<br>the alerts but it was three months and a<br>thousand deaths later the wh 0 declared<br>an outbreak and it was really five<br>months until the global humanitarian<br>response kicked into gear this is a<br>photograph of a meal first victim you<br>can see a little babe in arms there and<br>there's a little heads dead is holding<br>him Justin behind and I think all those<br>people are dead he hits a little plan of<br>what happened in terms of the<br>transmission you can see a meal there at<br>the top and his sister Philomena and his<br>parents they are attended by a nurse at<br>the redic co dieu hospital and thin<br>spread occurred within the hospital and<br>then went out to other villages and you<br>can see it trends which I can show here<br>maybe I could have a point i don't know<br>Peter goes assistant point you can see<br>it spread out into the other villages<br>where many more people got infected it<br>spread amongst the healthcare workers in<br>the hospital and then the aventure<br>another doctor and then the doctor and<br>all his brothers got it almost all of<br>whom died so it's a very rapid spread<br>which is occurring and you see the time<br>frame done they are right hand side<br>there this is a composite map of how was<br>spread and if you can see there right in<br>the middle of this confluence of three<br>countries Guinea Sierra Leone and<br>Liberia as where the Sam started and<br>then the month are going across the<br>writing see March there and then April<br>in C greatly gradually it's becoming<br>Ritter and more districts are being<br>involved more countries being involved<br>and then as you get and you can see with<br>the capital cities us and the bottom<br>left-hand corner there you can see<br>Freetown which is the capital of sierra<br>leone and Monrovia Kepler Liberia and if<br>you just keep your eye on Monrovia there<br>as you go across so you can see very<br>intense transmission occurring within<br>the urban areas so you've got this<br>multifocal urban-rural spread with very<br>intense transmission occurring is very<br>poor and towns this is a graph of f of<br>the incidents occurring over time and<br>you see the three countries there Guinea<br>Liberia and Sierra Leone and if you look<br>at the middle one Liberia this is a<br>country this is the classical picture of<br>an outbreak which is occurring when the<br>point out break it occurs as an epidemic<br>and it goes up and goes downs even got a<br>name which is far as law describing it<br>if you look on the right and Sierra<br>Leone you'll see that there's the<br>epidemic curve looks a bit the same they<br>look across the lift where it started<br>and guinea you see that there's a sort<br>of stuttering start and then the shape<br>of that curve is looking quite different<br>which makes you very suspicious that<br>actually thinks out all well there but<br>the description of the epidemic isn't<br>right and that the it's likely that term<br>the control measures up and the<br>reporting is an accurate this is a<br>summary of the cases that have occurred<br>just so you get a bit of a sense of it<br>you can see the number of cases and bold<br>there and guinea 3,000 cases with a two<br>thousand death which is roughly a 60 odd<br>percent mortality rate Liberia on the<br>other hand has got 9,000 cases with a<br>somewhat lower mortality rate and then<br>Sierra Leone at the bottom there live in<br>thousand cases and they got as much<br>substantially lower mortality again the<br>differences in the epidemiology in the<br>description makes you concerned about<br>this via neither hope reporting under<br>reporting and the lack of had<br>information based on good diagnostic<br>techniques so you may get the number of<br>cases rather scoot of course when it<br>happened in Africa that was then spread<br>out to the Western world and you can see<br>the other countries that were involved<br>United States obviously all heard about<br>what was going on over there UK Norway<br>in other places in Spain now if you look<br>down at those and bars at the bottom the<br>green you can see the mortality in the<br>number of cases and those managed in the<br>West and there the mortality I think<br>it's five deaths out of<br>before or something like that so the<br>mortality is more like you know<br>twenty-five percent or something like<br>that so the mortality rate is<br>substantially lower and of course this<br>creates this issue about you know how do<br>you manage this awful disease and<br>resource-poor settings and what<br>resources are available for its<br>management and places that have lots<br>resources so if you're lucky enough to<br>be born at States President Obama sort<br>of scenes they were planing you put into<br>the thing there and flown back that was<br>actually the hospital room in Nebraska<br>with the first patient was managing<br>United States and obviously this is a<br>completely different kid kid love fish<br>and with all the benefits of modern<br>medicine were able to mortality was so<br>substantially lower the public health<br>response is also quite different so this<br>is just the public health response for<br>that one case I went to United Kingdom<br>you see one case there's health care<br>worker there are 55 patients who were<br>contacts all of whom were followed up a<br>net follow up of cases so you know<br>you're filed in fiction proudly and is<br>really important so what's not happening<br>and obviously in epic as identification<br>with context managing to isolate them<br>and look after them so what about the<br>history of Ebola it was first diagnosed<br>in 1976 happen to the year I graduated<br>from Medical School and was founded in a<br>small mission hospital and the<br>Democratic sorry ends a year and new<br>sort of spread that this Vince had<br>occurred and dr. excess of calling<br>because I don't know what his name as an<br>African doctor a men of actually a lot<br>of courage were sent Leah by as a<br>government with soap and water and some<br>specimen containers to go and see what<br>was going on and when he arrived there<br>people heard this doctor come and so<br>they sort of emerged out the bush to see<br>what was going on he looked around and<br>found that through a quad our bodies and<br>only three nurses they're all from a<br>missionary Catholic mission one of them<br>had died the next day and all three of<br>them died and there a lot of bodies<br>around<br>people came to see what was happening<br>and gradually he collected samples and<br>he set those up to Belgium they remember<br>the zarya was previously the Belgian<br>Congo and toes links with the Belgian<br>Congo so p2p up we've got these samples<br>and the Institute of Medicine and<br>Belgium Antwerp and what he got with the<br>thermos flasks of emmett he opened it up<br>and here's this blood swimming rampant<br>side and lots of broken vials now bear<br>in mind these came from samples where<br>there's a mortality of something like<br>ninety percent of this outbreak i use<br>elysee understand be just a little bit<br>nervous a bit hairy handled them and so<br>he does the lictor had me electron<br>microscopy and showed us a virus that<br>never been described before this is the<br>gentleman here on the right Peter POS<br>and his Institute and the virus which he<br>sawed out electron microscope is this<br>filovirus which is like a thread and you<br>see it's a long skinny thing that's<br>nothing like that had ever been seen<br>before there's a cartoon of the bottom<br>right there which gives an idea of the<br>structure you can see it's a long thread<br>inside this a single strand of RNA which<br>is obviously the ginger government and<br>on the outside there is a a vile<br>envelope or membrane now that membrane<br>is derived from the host cells and the<br>important thing about that is it means<br>that it's easily disrupted with things<br>like detergents and soapy water so the<br>soap and water that break dr. cook with<br>them were very important for the<br>infection control element obviously this<br>other proteins on the outside which are<br>derived from the virus itself and you<br>can see that a little sort of that<br>that's on the outside and are important<br>because they are the antigens on the<br>surface which are specific to the virus<br>and can be targeted with antibodies and<br>so on now the top live picture there is<br>a picture of the Ebola river so if you<br>want to know where Ebola name came from<br>this because that this village is right<br>next to the Ebola river this looks no<br>pretty nondescript sort of river really<br>no doubt plenty of bets in her hand the<br>trees and you can see on the right there<br>this is the plane he landed on the usual<br>thing if you manage to fly into an area<br>like this is that the pilot wouldn't let<br>stop the engines he keep them roaring<br>and usually take up and half the stuff<br>can out but me and you can see one of<br>the nurses he took with him into the<br>hospital this is actually the initial<br>outbreak took place here he is dressed<br>up and has kept here to stop and get<br>herself getting infected this is just a<br>photograph of her has a workbook and the<br>map you drew now these are absolutely<br>cool things that you do for basic<br>epidemiology good old time and place and<br>person what's happening where it's<br>written in French and it's kind of<br>interesting to try and the decipher<br>Ettin being see here the method the<br>village what she did so he was trying to<br>figure out where it was that the virus<br>had been how was spread and what was<br>sort of stop the epidemic occurring so<br>just a bit about that outbreak 280<br>people out of 380 died the side the<br>eight percent mortality there were some<br>survivors and because he was able to<br>interview them he found two key things<br>one most had been at the hospital and<br>secondly my many of them had been<br>funerals and both of those are critical<br>of vesicular transmission list back and<br>of the young women aged 20 to 30 that<br>all tend antenatal facilities at the<br>hospital the clinic he also found that<br>the village only had three syringes and<br>that they have been used for multiple<br>injections nama saya 1976 now I knew<br>about HIPAA times B or HIV or something<br>so I think this is relatively common<br>practice and at me now if anyone's<br>interested in just basic epidemiology<br>and how it developed there's a book<br>called the ghost map and some of you may<br>have read it I haven't read it bat when<br>I first width the London School of<br>Hygiene Tropical Medicine the first<br>lecture was given by the Dean in the<br>school and he told the story of Jon Snow<br>jon snow was the physician and london<br>who was present this terrifying<br>outbreaks of Cholera with very high<br>mortality and he in the local vicar am<br>Henry right side I think they met doubt<br>what happened and they showed that all<br>these cases were occurring within<br>walking distance of a very pump with<br>pump water and Broad Street and became<br>very famous as the Broad Street<br>the stench of all the PO in the street<br>and roundabouts made people believe that<br>my asthma or what was in the ear was<br>transmitting the bag even knew that was<br>right except ahead the clue that maybe<br>it was warded warm had indeed those when<br>he met that out he found that there's a<br>woman who lived up with him stay on him<br>previous up nearby and she said who<br>serve an everyday down to get word from<br>their pump and she's the only one that<br>was able to drink it and she's in when<br>they got cholera and died and so<br>gradually the evidence came that it was<br>water that was spreading it and he took<br>the handle of the pump at Broad Street<br>and hip Adam it went away it's a lot<br>more work done but if anyone is<br>interested the basic sort of surely the<br>epidemiology of you know what's happened<br>when and where and what are the links<br>they're still really important for<br>controlling outbreaks so what about<br>subsequent outbreaks so before the<br>current epidemic there's been something<br>like I think it's 28 outbreaks and the<br>numbers of these range from one we just<br>an isolated case through too many the<br>mean has this from something like 85<br>mortality rates or something that range<br>between 25 and ninety percent most<br>remote forested areas and you see that<br>photograph of the Rubik see how far i<br>have sort of remote and the geography<br>contains the thing and me and but all of<br>them have been contained just by the<br>simple basic things early diagnosis<br>contact tracing isolation bearing the<br>dead safely and standard in fiction<br>control so for water and chlorine which<br>disrupts that membrane around the virus<br>and been delivered through local<br>healthcare systems with a bit of support<br>from international partners so just<br>looking at this where these outbreaks<br>have occurred so this is five strains or<br>so and you can see in the West African<br>area and that's where the variance<br>tracks got to but there's been lots of<br>other outbreaks the notice in particular<br>over here and more East Africa and Rand<br>Uganda and Kenya their own Lake Victoria<br>and actually the samples at Peter Pio<br>took<br>that time we were very important for the<br>epidemiology of HIV because all those<br>samples were reexamined later and found<br>that was epicenter with HIV epidemic<br>we've not a lot about this for some time<br>these are these are posters that I<br>downloaded from the CDC which go back<br>way before when this happened you can<br>see the basic facts of me you can't get<br>the bowl of breathing through the year<br>you can't get it through drinking water<br>you can't get it through food you get it<br>through body fluid exposure from people<br>who've died of Ebola anything really<br>that contaminates them you can get it<br>through sticking yourself with a needle<br>or other device and you can infected<br>animals now remember that in primates<br>also get this and so in a lot of deaths<br>of chimps and also other great apes from<br>Ebola and often these animals are you<br>know use for bush meat and so on and<br>what should you do when you get it it's<br>only spread when people are sick patient<br>must have symptoms in after 21 days<br>you'll know whether you've got it or not<br>because that's when the occupation<br>period is why is it caused such severe<br>disease well this virus and fix<br>macrophages and dendritic cells now<br>these are two key cells in the immune<br>system the macrophage there's one that<br>produces a whole lot of cytokines which<br>promote the inflammatory response and<br>they live primarily in the bone marrow<br>and lymph node but also the liver and<br>spleen which take a big hit when these<br>viruses these cells killed and also on<br>the dendritic cell dendritic cell was a<br>cell which picks up viral particles and<br>other things and then goes and takes<br>them to the lymph node and sits to the<br>immune system here go find this and kill<br>it now you can imagine if those cells<br>have been taken out and killed before<br>their stunts the immune response and it<br>leads to the some huge inflammatory<br>reaction which will cause little clots<br>and the blood vessels and further and<br>peering organ function and stops the<br>development of antibodies so it tends to<br>be a aamir suppressor than its own right<br>okay so wyd the delays two months in<br>1000 death before wh 0 declared an<br>international emergency another two<br>months before global few minutes here<br>in response I think the key of here is<br>just the unpreparedness and other parts<br>of Africa this have been seen and had<br>never been seen in West Africa they had<br>a very fragile health system incapable<br>of responding the people in the rural<br>areas probably move less and take it<br>with them less than people in the cities<br>and once it spread the city's saw that<br>the tins transmission occurring when the<br>urban areas the same time but me there's<br>a separate outbreak in the Deborah code<br>Republic of Congo and that was the you<br>know contain undeclared you know Boulder<br>free within a few weeks compared with<br>this which is ongoing now one of the key<br>things that's essential for control of<br>this is engaging with the public now we<br>all work on several paradigms in the<br>medical world we do a lot of analyzing<br>and thinking and then to think about<br>what we're going to do make your plan<br>and try and put it in place other part<br>of this works and the much more human<br>thing which is to see things going wrong<br>and enter feel it and then act and<br>change from the public's point of view I<br>think they operate of you know much more<br>and the scene what's happened feeling<br>the east of it and thinking about what<br>change can be put in place and that may<br>take a bit of time and the doctors they<br>sometimes give a bit frustrated about<br>what they think should happen but the<br>emotional content of what happens is<br>very important for an effective response<br>now this is a bullet success in Nigeria<br>which I will just comment on which is<br>really the the cerebral response this<br>lady here was the one who's created for<br>stopping the spread in Nigeria her name<br>is dr. edit Bo she was on duty and her<br>patient came in called Patrick so here's<br>a Liberian American and he was sudden<br>came to Vegas hotel and he was unwell<br>they denied any contact with Ebola which<br>was untrue but she thought perhaps it<br>was the case the patient had be<br>physically restrained by her and three<br>of her colleagues a stockman leaving<br>blob oh yeah Liberian government and got<br>in touch with the Nigerian<br>Gavin insisted that he got released to<br>go to some conference she refused she<br>insisted that there's a Public Health<br>Alert put out an institution of proper<br>infection control they contact that they<br>traced over a thousand contacts the<br>extensive media campaign was launched<br>within a few days and if you went into<br>Nigeria you saw billboards everywhere<br>everyone knew about about the bowl<br>within a few days and it was stopped<br>with 20 cases and a death and of course<br>she was one of victims she and the two<br>other doctors who has trained the<br>patient were exposed there's no<br>extraordinary woman actually and her dad<br>was the professor of pathology at a bus<br>university her grandfather he was the<br>vice charge for the University and her<br>great grandfather was the Bishop of<br>Nigeria and she ever see had an intense<br>public health and public spirited<br>motivation so key strategies safe burial<br>quick dignified burials essential and of<br>course the staff who are going to do<br>that the people who've been recruited to<br>do that task a stack and very hot stuff<br>they have to that very slow and care for<br>what they do they have be hosed down<br>with and disinfectant and so on and<br>their suits obviously smelled there as<br>well as looking threatening you need to<br>get the basic hip edema jimothy aren't<br>you right find the patients many of whom<br>are unknown and often the only ways of<br>funny who they are to go to the funerals<br>and try and figure out who has been in<br>contact at the funeral and then you've<br>got I set the context now people don't<br>want to be isolated that's obviously<br>disruptive to them and they would get<br>some paranoia rest of it the funeral<br>practices are very important and West<br>Africa both men's and women's had<br>separate initiation societies and they<br>also control the deaths and the funeral<br>practices so these are gender specific<br>so sort of minimum information is that<br>the women would braid the hair of the<br>woman concerned and thrissur up nicely<br>and the men will be shaved obviously a<br>sharp instrument and so on was pretty<br>important so you can imagine that just a<br>little bit of breakdown infection<br>control just at exposure<br>correct many victims and one woman has<br>had at least three hundred and<br>seventy-five people infected from her<br>funeral almost all of whom died so a<br>safe burial is absolutely crucial and<br>it's very disruptive for a society when<br>they're not able to grieve in the way<br>they seem as demons appropriate and I<br>that in this society you know these are<br>areas where there's a lot of a lot of<br>issues around slavery and history and<br>around HIV trials which you know Dennis<br>to benefit the local people and so on<br>and so there's a lot of local suspicion<br>not surprisingly and so and the trust<br>and communication were pretty jolly<br>minimal here's some photographs just<br>taken from the web now if you get HIV<br>and you get this really sick a lot of<br>people will make their way towards a<br>health care center or elsewhere and i<br>will die just so where they are many<br>people have found actually crouched in<br>the doorway you know there because<br>they're praying whatever and I did no<br>time someone comes to look there's just<br>a photograph taken by when the BBC<br>journalists and of course you know the<br>people are looking to see what's going<br>to happen and what happens is that these<br>sorts of folks arrive the burial team<br>and you can see they look pretty<br>frightening really their camera than<br>some of these are covered in this stuff<br>these are brave people I must say and<br>sometimes they look like that with a<br>buddy comes and gets taken away and<br>they'll be buried very quickly<br>essentially saying god bless you wrist<br>and peace and a hole in the ground and<br>you see that's terribly disruptive to<br>the whole grieving process of the nation<br>the people who do this task are also<br>under bitten but most of them don't go<br>to work and before they go to work<br>before dawn to get up and they stay away<br>until it's dark and then come back and<br>go sleep because the neighbors are very<br>worried they're going to bring it our<br>next thing they're going to be infected<br>as well and you can see the kind of<br>study looks on these people's faces and<br>they can imagine that they may be pretty<br>suspicious about what's going on some<br>people survive and of course the net<br>result of that as<br>there's tremendous social dislocation<br>occurring many times there are hubs or<br>streets that have got no one there and<br>the only record your head of the person<br>living near told us that this is the<br>National Election Commission sinister<br>photograph of the person and then sent<br>new vehicle of their existence and<br>outside civil society disrupted because<br>this checkpoints you see this chap is<br>taking a temperature this guy and see<br>that he's got his face mask rounders<br>throat which renders neck which is<br>probably not doing much good I think the<br>police it might be holding his in his<br>hand there is you sort of directing<br>directing people so engaging with the<br>public that emotional response trying to<br>get people to understand that honestly<br>your lives and the society depend on<br>your changing it's been the task and<br>having how do you do it now after some<br>time a lot of the politicians engaged in<br>this in particular the present of one of<br>the country's not forgotten which I'm<br>sorry did at ER with a musician everyone<br>right didn't realize that this was for<br>real the minister concerned of ginger<br>Social Welfare and he nourishes and<br>there's a musician so he made eight<br>songs and these things got played on the<br>radio quite a bit so and you know you<br>know your controller maybe you can play<br>the step but it started to get right<br>through the whole society and they<br>developed their own little dramas and<br>ghost daughter door and educate people<br>and so on mend about prevention use of<br>soap and water and avoiding body contact<br>so ABC in the HIV world as absence be<br>faithful or use a condom they have the<br>new one which is a void body contact<br>which was the news and public health<br>thing and here's just an image of some<br>of the radio things that we're going on<br>okay so what about the clinical features<br>well it starts off with them with a<br>febrile illness with aches and pains in<br>the body and fatigue then there's this<br>gastrointestinal phase which lasts 3 to<br>10 days which you carry on obviously<br>having the fevers and so on and then you<br>get this if it yet retain tummy pain<br>nausea and vomiting and diarrhea<br>if you survive through that then you<br>either go into renal failure or you<br>recover and the renal failures are<br>social I blood pressure and so on<br>difficulty breathing that the gevalia<br>starts to get better and you may be able<br>to eat and drink a bit so you can see<br>that the major complication of<br>dehydration is really very severe and<br>then after that there's sometimes as<br>some leaving from the gut and this<br>confusion pen me and there seems to be a<br>significant phenomenon of of confusion<br>so I'm in your skin base laughs and here<br>drop off now there's been someone to do<br>good studies down this is just a wee bit<br>of detail from one well perform the<br>study and you can see here that amongst<br>the patients most are quite young 15 to<br>44 the case fatality rate in the study<br>was Cindy wonder said I think this is<br>well documented data incubation period<br>11 days or so the pcl to the web testing<br>for the virus particles and the blood<br>becomes positive within 24 hours which<br>is an important thing but you can still<br>get negatives up to 72 hours and that's<br>very important when you're trying to<br>figure out how you're going to manage<br>the patient on the key things is this<br>vomiting and large amounts of daya<br>ruining see often 5 liters a day<br>persisting up a seven days respiratory<br>symptoms are real so early on at once<br>you starting in a few cases occurring<br>the healthcare system was completely<br>overwhelmed when people went to the<br>hospital they didn't expect to see all<br>the stuff covering over so let's lead to<br>this poor interaction between the<br>patient and doctors and many doctors in<br>one starter not use the equipment<br>because they couldn't react to the<br>patient properly which obviously lead to<br>a high mortality and me in the medical<br>staff there's a triaging system will<br>show you a diagram in a mid-level sort<br>of works but chlorine spray was the key<br>thing to try and stop spread and<br>obviously a lot of equipment and things<br>was lacking you still have this issue or<br>how do we differentiate this from<br>malaria and tie forward another and<br>future services so it's with this test<br>coming but often that tests the bowlin<br>takes time and you may have to do it<br>again to pmc<br>certain in the meantime the patients are<br>treated with things to stop them<br>vomiting and then fluids and so on and<br>trying to control the vomiting and<br>diarrhea and because the survival rate<br>was so low you can see that a lot of<br>people that are contained a hospital<br>falling on a diet I go there so the<br>issue of building public confidence is<br>essential and you've got to have some<br>successes otherwise patients are not<br>going to come along so this is a map<br>begin taken from data the thing to help<br>from its and some points here long<br>before this outbreak occurred but you<br>can see here how a triage system might<br>work so patients sort of come and see at<br>the bottom their patients have won by<br>getting in the staff another and these<br>blue things are backups of chlorine<br>which are supposed to be used for<br>washing hands everything else that goes<br>on and to spray patients would probable<br>suspected cases on the right there and<br>you can see they've got their own<br>latrine or bathroom you once it's got<br>that the patients who are in the<br>high-risk zone confirmed cases at the<br>top there and then so you then you try<br>to give me you know not have to give the<br>patients who have clearly got it and<br>you're not going to submit it to others<br>they fishing see here there's a little<br>place out to the morgue and so on you<br>want to do this you see they sit here<br>sloped down so you don't have all the<br>stuff coming back into thee and to the<br>institution and you need to have some<br>low risk areas obviously people who<br>haven't got it laundry another facility<br>so this instead of Metro that plan of<br>how mittens on frontiers works with the<br>management and all the spraying and<br>stuff you know you've got to dispose of<br>the laced something like 300 liters per<br>bid today and takes a long time to get<br>all these infrastructures and placed and<br>so we can imagine that you're getting<br>deaths of the healthcare people as well<br>as and patients the HIV treatments are<br>being lost antenatal cares being lost<br>earlier treatments being compromised the<br>vaccination system for children has gone<br>where you can predict a measles outbreak<br>without too much difficulty and there's<br>a lot of trust in the health care system<br>so dealing with anything beyond the<br>normal and these circumstances as leads<br>to a disaster and you see here this is<br>the immunization clinic just getting<br>going again which is really essential to<br>try and keep some of these things at bay<br>that's a few and African living in West<br>Africa what a few our health care worker<br>who are managing to been born in German<br>is listed out to be so this is a<br>patient's as published in new New and<br>journal of medicine 36 year old chap<br>when he got into hospital Hamburg<br>haven't been evacuated out of Africa he<br>was alert his oriented with my abdominal<br>pain he has so little fluid and as an<br>assistant when they looked for his big<br>veiny inferior vena cavas completely fed<br>as I was no blood net but there's a<br>demon through a little league daph into<br>the tissues particularly the bell and<br>the lymph nodes but he was managing to<br>Brie them do things quite well he<br>developed gram-negative sepsis bacteria<br>that and top of us indeed and as they<br>gave him lots of fluid he then all the<br>staff leaking out so I came in around<br>his heart members lungs he developed<br>respiratory failure they gettin but too<br>much juice at one stage and but he was<br>managed without being intubated and then<br>he developed a severe and kipper<br>allopathy another's brain wasn't working<br>from day 6 to 14 and they slowly<br>improved we had a lot of hallucinations<br>and delirium this is just to show a<br>little bit of data about what this<br>happened in this chip if you look along<br>the top line he sees temperatures<br>running around the 40 mark for a bit and<br>you can see the most important thing is<br>just looked down at the fluid<br>measurements using intravenous fluids<br>you see on daily been there when the<br>first mr. days of illness of course we<br>just got to hem do for getting 13 liters<br>of intravenous fluid I don't think I've<br>ever give<br>anyone 30 meters under in this building<br>the day and if you go yelling but<br>further you can see the diary he had<br>eight and a half liters of diarrhea so<br>you can see getting the third belt right<br>what goes in what comes out kind of<br>balanced as a real mission and of course<br>if you're working in a big tertiary<br>Center there's lots of clever tricks for<br>doing it you see here over this time<br>beats requiring 13 11 9 Greg up to 30<br>and again leaders applaud just to try<br>and keep the rifle fluid in the<br>intravascular space and the diarrhea<br>volumes gradually go down please<br>vomiting in bit as well you see as urine<br>volume series were amazing it's better<br>than new hearing volumes go up now this<br>shows the amount of virus and has blatt<br>so the red line near shows the amount of<br>arsenic see it stepping down after a few<br>days out from his blood and the other<br>line shows the white cell count which is<br>a macro of bacterial infection it went<br>zooming up there he got lots of<br>antibiotics and then they managed to<br>contain there now this has got some of<br>the same information but a bit of extra<br>stuff cook which is sort of interesting<br>you see the red line there is the virus<br>going down and that's blood because you<br>go across here to the yellow line here<br>we've got virus and his urine which is<br>persisting for a lot longer and you can<br>see the virus and Liz swit so you can<br>imagine if you're in efrika and the<br>patient's diet and you're preparing them<br>for the funeral even if you're just<br>dealing with the outside of the person<br>you're going to be exposed to virus and<br>quite large amounts and maybe even one<br>virus is enough to infect them and so he<br>made antibodies and and he got better<br>now and fetch this he can imagine that<br>has we were watching this unfold from<br>the different pictures these departments<br>point of view that we thought oh my<br>goodness we're going to have to make<br>sure we don't catch those if this turns<br>up and how do we manage the the had we<br>manage this now this is a photograph of<br>one of them pitch control Roasters Ruth<br>Barrett and there's a lot of work went<br>on trying to figure out how to we could<br>use our local local resources to make<br>sure we keep safe and Ruth here is so<br>see she's got some gloves on and she's<br>going to be taking all the stuff off now<br>keep others taking it off no she's she's<br>taking those gloves off there and she's<br>trying to not to contaminate the outside<br>so this she goes inside the vehicle of<br>running her fingers down there and she's<br>going to fold it back over the top<br>without contaminating herself okay she<br>was just touching the inside the glove<br>and then it gets disposed of the<br>appropriate place now she's she's doing<br>see she's got a mat in it so she needed<br>lead in what alcohol rub on her hands to<br>get rid of any of that she might have<br>got there by mistake and now she's going<br>to do the next maneuver oh yes there we<br>go so she's just pulling the undoing the<br>gown from behind and again imagine if we<br>were dealing with the patient who's got<br>you know a theatres and diarrhea day and<br>other things you might be trying to<br>dispose of that there's a good chance<br>you're going to splash yourself so just<br>touching the inside and no not touching<br>outside at all that she goes down<br>rolling it up outside and so then it can<br>be disposed of in the appropriate place<br>again get the alkyl onto your hands and<br>then she's got a masking and now you've<br>just got to make sure you don't come<br>touch the outside of that thing when you<br>actually have it on it's actually very<br>easy to touch your hands onto the onto<br>the front of it just post that and then<br>hands behind just get the full stretch<br>of that's from the mask don't touch the<br>front of it and take it off and then<br>that gets disposed up and then our way<br>okay so there's a lot of time if it went<br>into this and Ruth sir lead the team and<br>a real practice ugh the Mac but he<br>practice the fear but I hope dies too<br>old Hector you can't see these patients<br>but and then again using the things of<br>course you've got to think about Hagen<br>disposable the stuff how it's going to<br>get incinerated how it's going to be<br>done safely to get down to the hospital<br>setting and even just having the stuff<br>on I mean I bought this summer stuff<br>here too<br>so you'd have a lot but have you got a<br>mask on and you've got this thing I'm<br>here you've imagined actually<br>communications pretty pathetic if you're<br>inside a room with us all the stuff<br>around and you try to not contaminate<br>yourself so it really interferes with<br>the sort of firm and duration of the<br>patient so the moments the treatment is<br>basically supporting see just by loading<br>people with say line you essentially<br>save lots of lives there are now<br>approved treatments there's lots of<br>things that are in the pipeline you've<br>probably heard of the SID map which has<br>got three monoclonal antibodies against<br>those little structures on the outside<br>of the virus i showed you at the<br>beginning and that's been shown to<br>prevent death and macaque semen started<br>after clinical onset of disease and some<br>patients have received this if the<br>patient's recovered then you can get<br>enta bodies from there bud and maybe<br>that would be helpful so where you are<br>using the patient survived then lots of<br>other fancy things that are being looked<br>at to try and produce vaccines and other<br>treatments now one of the issues around<br>us is that and I'll talk about more in<br>just a minute or two when the issues<br>around this is that these things are not<br>easy the seed map has actually made in a<br>tobacco plant so it's been engineered to<br>produce the right antibodies and it can<br>be scaled up very easily and only that<br>there's a whole lot of Alan Fletcher<br>properly around it there's also laws in<br>the West African countries many of those<br>countries had people doing clinical<br>trials from HIV how much came in them<br>and we're done and then the company's<br>left and there wasn't provision made for<br>people in that country and so they got<br>pretty fed up with people coming and<br>doing stuff for the past law saying you<br>can't come and do the stuff and this<br>you've got ongoing treatment for us so<br>at one of the reasons I think why this<br>stuff was only given to anyone in it and<br>patients in the United States was<br>because of all his issues around the<br>laws and how you deal with it<br>appropriately so one of the basic<br>lessons firstly countries with weak<br>health care systems and few basic public<br>health and distracters canvas tents and<br>shocks and when it happens that you get<br>disasters are many 0 here levels<br>preparedness including high level of<br>intelligence reported cases reason is to<br>treat the first case as a national<br>emergency that's what happened Nigeria<br>that's what that lady energy said I've<br>got a case I think about a case the<br>public health coming down on you and you<br>cannot move the laws on my side and<br>you've got to be prepared to put a push<br>it through hard there's no single<br>intervention that's going to be bringing<br>them to control it's got to be the whole<br>thing together one goes and I think when<br>the big issues has been keeping people<br>isolated and not going out and you know<br>if it's buzzing League remya whatever it<br>is to be and if that breaks down then<br>it's a problem community engagement<br>service Utley vital to mesh get contact<br>tracing early reporting adherence to the<br>protective measures and safe burials in<br>place so whro has produced a roadmap of<br>things that they would like to see<br>happen in place for 2015 first of all<br>community resistance has got to be<br>tackled and the woods are with the<br>greatest urgency contact tracing is the<br>weakest part of the response so far best<br>thirty percent I suspect the others<br>that's an over estimate that the<br>response needs to be tailored to make<br>sure the think needs a district and sub<br>district levels so all can organize the<br>industrial big central places is no good<br>when you've got lots of things going on<br>and isolated places and in need wins<br>local flare-up you need a rep response<br>team and government put it in place we<br>need to do the inner that was some<br>really crazy situations where people<br>were supposed to be quarantined and they<br>didn't give them any food they wouldn't<br>leave them out there the corpse in the<br>room and you know just sort of i created<br>this horrible scenario for how people<br>have supposedly been inquiring<br>decentralized strategy i think there's a<br>moral imperative to get the the case<br>fatality down as i mentioned before<br>something like twenty five percent and<br>the evacuated people and Cindy on<br>percent and the good studies that have<br>been done<br>never occur and how do we do that how do<br>we respond it's really essential to get<br>the public health systems functioning<br>again I'm much more resilient put on I<br>need to set up research and there's two<br>big things that needed vaccines and<br>pointed gear testing now both of those<br>things can be done needs to be done not<br>during an emergency emergency is not the<br>time to do stop what that means is<br>commitment to develop these things when<br>at other times because all the<br>appropriate if the co of moral and legal<br>obligations need to be fulfilled for now<br>whi realizing that this was actually a<br>pretty pathetic effort many ways ahead<br>and mergency meeting and generally 25th<br>of this year and the executive board<br>unanimously said that he bola with a<br>dollar ending the current outbreak<br>strengthening global preparedness<br>ensuring the retro capacity to prepare<br>for and respond to future landscape I<br>outbreaks emergencies and its<br>consequences and that was voted through<br>unanimously in fact it took four days<br>and to reach their conclusion and the<br>big issue is around intellectual<br>property and various bits of the report<br>which are quite interesting to read but<br>of course what's going on as people were<br>trying to develop new stuff and the<br>Christians were who owns it and they're<br>really saying they they're affirming<br>notion of intellectual property but<br>they're saying look though need to have<br>some pulled fans to do this and that the<br>Interceptor do it we've got a secure<br>sustainable financing for health<br>research and development on emerging<br>hinder and figure diseases and unlike to<br>be funded just purely everburn the<br>private sector require a mixture of<br>responses and the intellectual property<br>that's about requires a lot of thinking<br>through they go on to say that they<br>should we should have hung gaan<br>collaboration and that they support d<br>linkage of the cost of the new<br>search and about in other words it's a<br>plan of money that someone's got to put<br>under the pot then we'll get some clever<br>people to develop these things that we<br>need and then owned by the public good<br>and I think that is an ideal solution<br>however I'm just bit suspicious that<br>that will be able to be achieved not<br>through lack of good well but just the<br>administrative hassle of how you do it<br>and who's going to put their hand up was<br>another matter so just as this quick<br>summary the outbreak in West Africa is a<br>truly shocking human tragedy and when<br>you just sort of think about things I've<br>been describing you realize just the<br>depth of the of the events that have<br>been going on there there have been true<br>heroines and heroes in the drama and it<br>will respond you know just to the<br>traditional sense we know how to control<br>it it's a matter of doing hard enough<br>and long enough with enough<br>determination but West Africa can't do<br>it on its own and it's going to need a<br>lot of help to rebuild the<br>infrastructure all the research and<br>treatments need to be developed that<br>that has to be done at times of when the<br>epidemic is not in the middle of it's<br>sort of activities and I need to get<br>these things done so and ethical manner<br>and so just let's not begrudge a foreign<br>aid which many cases goes to this worthy<br>you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
