Alan bollard I'm an<br>economist and got my beginnings here at<br>University of Auckland I came to<br>Auckland in 1969 it seems that a while<br>ago now i sat down and did stage one<br>economics stage one economics is fun it<br>all fits together everybody produces<br>stuff and they consume and they<br>distribute it and it all comes together<br>in one single equation and it's so neat<br>and that sort of fitted my idea of the<br>world sadly or not I went on and did<br>more economics and I learnt the rest of<br>the time I spent learning it's not like<br>that at all it's very untidy subject but<br>that's because it's an untidy world and<br>I spent my time really working out how<br>economies work and how we should think<br>about them an economy is something which<br>is full of a lot of people being<br>organized in a way if it's badly<br>organized people lead sad unhappy lives<br>if it's organized well then we get<br>welfare and we get choices and do things<br>i do think market forces are important<br>for guiding decisions but that they<br>won't always work in all cases and<br>that's why we have regulation and how<br>that has to work actually it sounds<br>pretty simple but costs and benefits are<br>important and that's because everything<br>does have a cost it's nothing free in<br>the whole world and with environmental<br>problems at the minute the world's just<br>telling us that once again you also<br>learn with macroeconomics that it's all<br>a connected up sort of system and if you<br>change something here then over here is<br>going to have an effect and you really<br>need to know what those are going to be<br>especially if like me you're going into<br>a policy as opposed to say business and<br>all of this people seeking to make their<br>way in the business world in my view<br>should be looking for starter general<br>education so they're not burning bridges<br>so they've got a broad span way of<br>looking at things before they know<br>enough to be able to make decisions<br>about what they want to do and where<br>they want to go I don't really<br>personally up hold that view of you can<br>sit down and plan your career out I<br>haven't<br>drifted round from job to job it's<br>keeping broad early on and then working<br>out where you're going to focus and how<br>you going to focus and mixing it in with<br>the right amount of real life experience<br>as well which differs for different<br>people but also from a geographical<br>point of view making sure somewhere on<br>that there's a real taste of places that<br>are going places very fast and could be<br>going in different directions and most<br>obviously for New Zealand that's East<br>Asia at the moment there was just so<br>much happening there it took Britain 150<br>years after the Industrial Revolution<br>before they got a middle-class<br>population China's done it in 10 years<br>and that's just an indication of how<br>fast things are changing their now the<br>only thing they really know and China is<br>whatever they're doing now it's not<br>going to be that next year it's going to<br>be something different that's an<br>uncomfortable world for some people but<br>I feel well educated and you've got a<br>way of putting that into your mindset<br>and knowing that you will be doing<br>different things then you're looking for<br>them and you're actively embracing them<br>and you're doing different stuff and<br>that's what we're all going to be doing<br>more else we might as well go into a<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
