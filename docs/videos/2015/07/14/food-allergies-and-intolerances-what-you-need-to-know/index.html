,<br>they both are adverse<br>reactions to food.<br>The difference is<br>that food allergy<br>is an immune-mediated response<br>to a food, a part of a food,<br>or an ingredient<br>as part of a food,<br>whereas a food<br>intolerance doesn't<br>involve the immune system.<br>So the signs and the symptoms<br>of food allergy and food<br>intolerance can be<br>quite different.<br>So we often, as an example,<br>think of food allergy<br>as being quite severe.<br>So some people, for example,<br>who are allergic to peanuts,<br>can have a very severe and<br>immediate immune reaction<br>to consuming a peanut.<br>So that can involve their mouth<br>swelling up and their airways.<br>And it could be serious<br>enough that if they<br>don't get immediate help,<br>they could actually die.<br>That's called an<br>anaphylactic shock,<br>where someone with<br>food intolerance<br>would not have such a<br>severe reaction to food.<br>They wouldn't have a<br>immune-driven response<br>in that way to food.<br>So their symptoms are<br>often less severe.<br>They often involve the<br>gastrointestinal tract<br>or the digestive<br>system, and so they<br>can have signs that could<br>be tummy aches, bloating,<br>diarrhoea.<br>So the signs and symptoms are<br>quite different,<br>and the way that people present<br>are different, but the two do<br>get quite confused.<br>A lot of people say that<br>they're allergic to a food when<br>actually they're not<br>really allergic to it.<br>They're actually intolerant or<br>they have a sensitivity to it.<br>It's very difficult<br>to truly state what<br>the prevalence of<br>food allergy is,<br>and much more difficult<br>to actually know<br>what the prevalence of<br>food intolerance is.<br>If we look at population<br>statistics in New Zealand,<br>it's estimated that<br>food allergy is<br>prevalent in about 1 and 1/2%<br>to 3% of the adult population,<br>maybe around 6% of children.<br>It does vary across<br>population groups,<br>and it also varies<br>a lot depending<br>on how it's being diagnosed.<br>It's quite difficult to<br>diagnose food allergy.<br>What you often find is<br>a lot of people report<br>they have food allergy, but in<br>fact if they are systematically<br>investigated and they go<br>through the proper diagnosis,<br>often they don't actually<br>have food allergies.<br>So, it's estimated that<br>about 38% of the population<br>say they have a<br>food allergy or food<br>intolerance, whereas in<br>reality the amount is<br>much less than that.<br>It's really important<br>to be properly diagnosed<br>with food allergy.<br>And it's very important that<br>it is managed correctly,<br>because removing certain<br>food items from the diet,<br>particularly in children,<br>can mean that they become<br>susceptible to malnutrition or<br>not getting adequate dietary<br>intake.<br>The literature would<br>suggest that there<br>is an increase in prevalence<br>of both food allergy and food<br>intolerance.<br>It's quite difficult<br>to really define,<br>because, first to really<br>look at prevalence,<br>we have to make sure that the<br>numbers that we're looking at<br>is true diet, you know,<br>a food allergy that<br>has been properly diagnosed.<br>But population studies in<br>both Europe and Australasia<br>would show that there<br>is an increase in food<br>allergy and food intolerance.<br>There are a number of hypotheses<br>why we have an increased<br>prevalence of food allergy.<br>One of the hypotheses is<br>the hygiene hypothesis.<br>So because we live in much<br>more hygienic environments<br>these days, our immune systems<br>aren't primed from an early age<br>to be able to deal with<br>some of the larger proteins<br>that we consume in food such as<br>cow's milk and wheat and eggs.<br>In the past, when we lived<br>in less hygienic conditions,<br>and I suppose babies got<br>dirty, their immune systems<br>were primed from an<br>early age, because they<br>would have more viral infections<br>and bacterial infections,<br>and also be infested with worms.<br>And these things,<br>obviously, young babies<br>don't have these days,<br>which is a good thing.<br>But the downside of that is<br>that their immune systems stay<br>immature for quite a long<br>time, and therefore they're<br>more likely to develop an<br>adverse food reaction to some<br>of the bigger<br>proteins when they're<br>introduced into their diets.<br>Some of the other<br>reasons are also<br>around early infant feeding.<br>So in the past we<br>had recommendations<br>that advised us to delay<br>the introduction of some<br>of those foods that<br>are allergenic,<br>such as milk, and wheat, and<br>eggs into infants' diets.<br>And it's thought that<br>by delaying them,<br>we could have sensitised<br>infants more to those foods,<br>so that when they<br>were introduced<br>to them after the age<br>of one, they were more<br>likely to be allergic to them.<br>So our new guidelines<br>in New Zealand<br>ask that we introduce them<br>around six months of age,<br>and the best thing<br>is to introduce them<br>while still breastfeeding.<br>Breastfeeding is really<br>important in terms<br>of protecting infants and young<br>children against food allergy.<br>The main foods that<br>cause food allergy,<br>there are eight foods in fact.<br>So there's nuts,<br>particularly peanuts,<br>which are, in fact, a legume,<br>not a nut, tree nuts, seafood,<br>particularly shellfish, cow's<br>milk, eggs, and soy products.<br>So food allergies, the<br>signs of food allergies,<br>are quite different depending<br>on whether they're immune<br>mediated, in terms<br>of whether they're<br>quite an immediate<br>immune reaction,<br>or whether it's a<br>slower immune reaction.<br>So with a very immediate immune<br>reaction, or immune response,<br>that's mounted by our<br>immune system, often<br>the signs are very<br>immediate and very severe.<br>So they can be anything<br>from an anaphylactic shock<br>or to getting a very<br>strong red rash, which<br>is called urticaria, or in some<br>cases, mouth swelling or throat<br>swelling.<br>And then the less<br>immune response,<br>or the less severe<br>would be some of the more<br>gastrointestinal responses,<br>which may be<br>diarrhoea or vomiting.<br>To actually diagnose<br>food allergy,<br>there's a number of steps<br>that have to take place.<br>So you need to go, people<br>need to actually see<br>an allergist or an<br>immunologist, and have what<br>we call a series of clinical<br>tests, which may involve a skin<br>prick test, or certain<br>type of blood test<br>which may look at some of the<br>immune markers in the blood<br>to certain food allergens.<br>Then after that<br>testing, often people<br>go on what is called an<br>elimination diet, so they're<br>put on a very restricted diet<br>of foods that are known to have<br>very low allergenicity,<br>and that may<br>be things like lamb<br>and rice and pears,<br>so quite a restrictive diet.<br>And then there is<br>a food challenge,<br>so foods are added back into the<br>diet in a very systematic way<br>over a period of time, and<br>I suppose the body is then<br>challenged with those foods,<br>to see weather somebody<br>reacts to them or not.<br>So it's quite an<br>intensive, long process<br>to determine to food allergy.<br>Obviously in people who have<br>very immediate or severe<br>reactions, their reaction<br>will happen quite quickly,<br>and the diagnosis<br>will be quite quick.<br>But those who have a long<br>or slower type reaction,<br>it can take a number of<br>months and sometimes up<br>to a year to diagnose<br>somebody with food allergy.<br>So people with food intolerance,<br>because they don't sometimes<br>get such specific<br>signs and symptoms,<br>can take quite a long time to<br>diagnose their intolerances.<br>So often they can have a similar<br>sort of systematic approach<br>to their diagnosis.<br>But they may need to<br>keep a food diary,<br>and keep a track of<br>signs and symptoms<br>when certain foods<br>are consumed, or they<br>may be put on an<br>elimination-style diet<br>and have foods added<br>back into their diet<br>again in a systematic way.<br>And then a response is<br>seen to see whether they're<br>intolerant to that food.<br>But it can take quite a<br>long, long time to diagnose.<br>One of the things with food<br>intolerances versus food<br>allergies, is that<br>food intolerances<br>can occur at different times.<br>So some people may be able to<br>tolerate a food quite well,<br>but then they may get<br>run-down, for example,<br>or stressed, or have<br>a lack of sleep,<br>and they then may not<br>be able to tolerate<br>that food during those times.<br>It can be quite difficult, then,<br>to pinpoint exactly what food<br>is causing them to have,<br>say, for example, diarrhoea<br>or tummy bloating.<br>Food allergies and<br>food intolerances<br>really need to be<br>managed with somebody<br>who specialises in that area.<br>So first and foremost,<br>to diagnose food allergy,<br>people need to go and see<br>either a clinical allergist<br>or immunologist.<br>And then if they're going<br>to have any alteration<br>of their diet, they should<br>really see a clinical<br>dietitian, so a dietitian who<br>is registered to practise in New<br>Zealand.<br>The gluten-free explosion, or<br>the gluten-free popular diet,<br>that we have now, or has been<br>popular in New Zealand for, I<br>suppose, the last five years,<br>is a reasonably easy diet<br>to follow<br>And it's become, I suppose,<br>popular because gluten<br>has been put down to being<br>responsible for many signs<br>and symptoms for people<br>with food intolerance.<br>And there are many more<br>gluten-free products,<br>obviously, now on the market.<br>So going gluten-free, as<br>I say, is very popular,<br>but, again, not everybody<br>really needs to be gluten-free.<br>They only need to be<br>gluten-free if they've<br>been shown to have gluten<br>sensitivity or gluten<br>intolerance.<br>There is a lot of myth<br>around the gluten-free diet.<br>Obviously, people<br>with celiac disease<br>have to adhere very strictly<br>to a gluten-free diet.<br>Many people put themselves<br>on gluten-free diets<br>because they say that<br>they feel better.<br>They're not as bloated.<br>They feel more comfortable<br>on a gluten-free diet.<br>The one thing people have to be<br>careful of is that many gluten<br>products, or gluten-free<br>products, I should say,<br>that are now on the market,<br>aren't particularly healthy.<br>So what's happened is<br>that wheat-based products,<br>such as bread and<br>cakes and biscuits,<br>have just been replaced<br>with gluten-free flours.<br>And so those food<br>products are still<br>very high in fat and sugars.<br>And so going gluten-free<br>doesn't necessarily<br>mean for a healthy diet.<br>The really important thing<br>with food allergy and food<br>intolerance is to get<br>a proper diagnosis<br>and make sure that<br>you're managed properly,<br>and that you<br>consult a dietitian.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
