resolves revolves<br>around the role that humans play in<br>changing a natural world particularly<br>marine systems and how natural science<br>can influence management and policy his<br>research has primarily focused on how<br>humans transferred species from around<br>the road the consequences of those<br>movements into multiple and evolutionary<br>context and the ways in which we do to<br>get prevent or mitigate the impacts of<br>these novel pests please welcome to the<br>legend for inaudible professorial editor<br>professor<br>well done Alastair reading through that<br>litany of locations that I've been my<br>mother likes to comment that I've also<br>dragged my her grandchildren<br>increasingly farther away until I<br>finally found the Antipodes it's not<br>many times that you get to see an<br>academic and gown so thank you for<br>showing up tonight I understand it's a<br>bit of a tradition as well to show some<br>embarrassing photos so we'll get that<br>over fairly quickly so I grew up in Lake<br>Tahoe in California and despite the fact<br>that this is a large freshwater and very<br>beautiful body of water our house was<br>literally at the bottom of this this ski<br>hill lake tahoe made me fall in love<br>with the ocean and as you can see from<br>the sailor suit at the age of five i<br>decided that i wanted to be a marine<br>biologist despite significant efforts<br>and attempts by my parents to dissuade<br>me I eventually ended up at Berkeley not<br>because Berkeley has a marine science<br>program but because it has the bodega<br>Marine Laboratory which now is is with<br>University of california-davis the<br>bodega Marine Lab was led by cadet hand<br>cadet was one of their classic natural<br>historians and of course he had a<br>passion for hydroids for hydrazones and<br>a fortuitous find Dylan rocks meant that<br>my senior thesis was based upon the<br>discovery and the description of a novel<br>bryozoan or sorry novel hydroid that was<br>found in conjunction with a bryozoan<br>zancona bryozoa fila was my attempt both<br>at the science in the description of the<br>species but also at the illustration and<br>it was a fantastic milled it was very<br>interesting of course to see two Dean's<br>from very different faculties<br>going to reconcile themselves to this<br>combined degree I would have followed<br>the path of a natural historian if not<br>for the opportunity that was presented<br>by professor Jim Carlton at the<br>University of Oregon he advertised the<br>opportunity to undertake a study in<br>marine bio invasions which in the<br>mid-80s was actually not a field of<br>great great interest it was not a field<br>that was recognized widely and I'll<br>return to this in a little while oh I mb<br>oregon institute of marine biology is<br>found on the southern oregon coast I<br>think it's claimed a famous it has about<br>240 days of rain each year as a<br>consequence about four and a half years<br>later I finished Jim had already<br>departed to the east coast of the US and<br>Lorraine Heisler a sexy son modeler<br>study in as my professor I had a few a<br>few less gray hairs then I think so<br>tonight I'd like to talk about a few<br>vignettes from my research and the the<br>discussion in terms of how we manage<br>biological invasions and specifically<br>I'd like to sway more towards the<br>applied end of this spectrum rather than<br>the pure science element as a species we<br>have a strong affinity to the ocean to<br>the coastal environment and of course as<br>you can see from this photo of the world<br>at night or this montage of the world at<br>night about twenty percent of the<br>world's population lives within the<br>coastal zone we derive many values from<br>the coast economic environmental social<br>cultural and many of these are exposed<br>to a variety of threats most of them<br>human mediated and we have relatively<br>few mechanisms to to deal with them<br>prevention mitigation once the impact is<br>already occurred and eventually<br>restoration to try and respond to those<br>and of course tonight I'll explicitly<br>talk about biological invasions so<br>as any sub-discipline of science we have<br>jargon introduced species is what we<br>tend to talk about as the human mediated<br>transfer of species but of course we're<br>all familiar with alien exotic<br>non-indigenous is perhaps a term you may<br>not have run across but the interesting<br>thing is you put any of those into your<br>Google search probably not at work for a<br>few of those but you do come up with a<br>wide variety of exemplars of course we<br>also have a suite of species for which<br>we cannot determine if their native or<br>introduced these species are now known<br>as cryptogenic or hidden origin which<br>gives us the opportunity to declare them<br>as suspect in in this verbiage now many<br>of these are probably a combination<br>either of cryptic species species<br>complexes they can also be species that<br>were introduced in the history of time<br>and so this category actually provides<br>us a great opportunity in terms of being<br>able to identify what are questionable<br>elements and to really identify the<br>uncertainty in our science and then<br>speaking to a new zealand audience it's<br>always kind of strange to explain to you<br>what biosecurity is given that you guys<br>invented it biosecurity is the<br>management and control of non-native<br>species of course post-911 the North<br>American usage has increasingly moved<br>towards bioterrorism elements and we<br>have to keep that in mind when we do a<br>search or we do some literature review<br>of the space so biological invasions<br>need to be placed in the context there<br>are natural invasions and there are<br>human mediated introductions biological<br>invasions can be seen in relation to<br>what our natural colonization processes<br>a space opens up in the environment and<br>we see colonization from nearby meters<br>to hundreds of kilometers and at spatial<br>or temporal scales of minutes two months<br>in contrast with in this natural context<br>large-scale biogeographic changes can<br>occur the melting of the sea ice in the<br>Arctic has now opened up a transfer of<br>species from the North Pacific to the<br>North Atlantic and vice versa these<br>occur over evolutionary time scales and<br>are still between adjacent provinces so<br>they're in the order spatial scale of<br>thousands of kilometers human mediated<br>movements however operate at time scales<br>equivalent to local processes but<br>transcend this spatial scale of natural<br>processes so there is no natural<br>mechanism by which a species could move<br>from Australia to Europe in 14 days and<br>yet that is the time frame language<br>shipping transfer of species so these<br>represent novel additions to communities<br>and ecosystems and indeed from a pure<br>science perspective biological<br>introductions can tell us very<br>interesting things about how communities<br>assemble and how communities dis<br>articulate how they fall apart when new<br>species arrive the potential impacts<br>obviously are across multiple values<br>that we see and so far the study of<br>biological invasions has really been in<br>a terrestrial and freshwater environment<br>it's only in recent years say 1980s that<br>we began to see an effort in the marine<br>context the management of biosecurity of<br>marine species really was triggered by a<br>suite of invasion events so globally<br>harmful algal blooms began to cause<br>human mortality and human morbidity<br>largely because we love shellfish and<br>harmful algal blooms are consumed by<br>shellfish that we eat as a consequence<br>that I owe accumulation has caused<br>significant problems these species were<br>demonstrably moved around through<br>shipping processes in North America<br>there was the invasion of the freshwater<br>zebra mussel<br>now the interesting thing about this is<br>it is a transnational issue both Canada<br>and the US but simultaneously the water<br>processing plant within the electorate<br>of a very senior senator in the US was<br>shut down because of biofouling issues<br>as a consequence the next day a bill was<br>introduced to Congress and we've seen<br>now a triggered response within North<br>America that was largely founded upon<br>that original invasion by the zebra<br>mussel and of course in Australia and<br>New Zealand we've had a sequence of<br>invasions that have achieved aspect<br>dominance not necessarily a significant<br>economic impact in most instances but<br>they were sufficient to trigger a<br>response in both governments one of the<br>biggest issues is that the supporting<br>knowledgebase is often quite poor and<br>even more importantly there's almost a<br>defeatist attitude that once something<br>gets here it's too late there's nothing<br>that can be done as a consequence a<br>large amount of effort has been spent in<br>the prevention space so if we look<br>globally we can see that there's this<br>super acceleration of invasions<br>individual locations where we've studied<br>San Francisco Bay Pearl Harbor in<br>Australia and Port Phillip Bay here in<br>New Zealand you can see this J shaped<br>curve and of course that's quite<br>terrifying because there is no topping<br>out there is no evidence of a slowing<br>down and the one thing that I would say<br>is the UK they stopped counting at 50<br>they decided not to go further so many<br>of the questions that we asked our which<br>species should we be concerned with<br>which transport vectors are most<br>relevant which pathways are most<br>important and of course we place that<br>within a risk management context so what<br>is the risk process now I know that Ian<br>white spoke about risk I won't go into a<br>great level of detail but I reflect upon<br>the risk process in relation to the<br>invasion process so in invasions very<br>clearly<br>there has to be some mechanism by which<br>species come on board a transport<br>mechanism or our transport vector they<br>need to be transported and there are<br>filters that occur during that process<br>they may have to pass through the<br>tropics if they're in exposed on an<br>exposed surface they may be in a ballast<br>tank for a fairly long period of time<br>they need to be discharged into that new<br>environment so inoculation ultimately<br>they have to establish a self recruiting<br>population and then subsequent to that<br>we anticipate spread and impact so if we<br>think about each stage of the invasion<br>process relative to the risk we can say<br>that and initially we need to identify<br>the end point that we're interested in<br>very clearly if we have a very highly<br>protective system we would choose a<br>quarantine endpoint that is inoculation<br>alone is sufficient for us to say that<br>it is a high-risk alternatively we may<br>only be interested in species that are<br>able to survive in our environment and<br>therefore establishment becomes the end<br>point that we're interested in or we may<br>as we see an increasing call in the<br>literature only pay attention to species<br>that cause impact so those species that<br>establish but then subsequently cause<br>damage to our values species are the<br>foundation of the hazard that represents<br>in this situation and as a consequence<br>we need to understand which species are<br>important that's relevant both for<br>uptake as well as for the establishment<br>phase of the invasion process so we can<br>search for suspects literature review is<br>the easy mechanism because the<br>literature is out there but of course<br>there are errors associated with the<br>literature both misidentifications time<br>lags as well as being able to identify<br>what is native versus what is non-native<br>may not be what the author was<br>interested in as a consequence there a<br>suite of criteria that we apply to try<br>and help us with the balance of evidence<br>clearly critical evaluations of the<br>vectors themselves are possible if a<br>vessel left China and arrived in Tirana<br>there's an easy mechanism for us to<br>sample the hole and determine these<br>suite of species are not native here<br>alternatively we can undertake targeted<br>assessments and of course as Alistair<br>mentioned i came to australasia in 1996<br>to work for the Center for Research on<br>introduced marine pests CSIRO was tasked<br>by government to establish a center in<br>1994 on the basis of the invasion of<br>asterias undaria and Sibella they were<br>to evaluate the scale and scope of<br>invasions in Australia to identify the<br>vectors of transport and identify any<br>management options that may be applied<br>as well as control measures that could<br>be put in place including biological<br>control interestingly Jim Carlton told<br>me when I first started my PhD Chad<br>you're never going to get a job as an<br>invasion biologist you got to figure out<br>a mechanism to brand yourself<br>differently so it gave me great pleasure<br>to be able to identify with him that yes<br>I did find the job it's on the other<br>side of the world so in 1996 we<br>established the Australian National port<br>surveys the first continental scale<br>effort to identify the scale and scope<br>of invasions in port environments and we<br>did this in two ways both a targeted<br>assessment in Port Phillip Bay which was<br>a very detailed four-year effort as well<br>as a suite of protocols that we could<br>apply in 39 other ports a consistent<br>survey design as well as sampling<br>protocols meant that we could we didn't<br>have to do it all we could actually get<br>universities consultancies and other<br>research organizations based in state<br>entities to undertake the work as well<br>ports are amazing environments if if I<br>may say some of the best dives I've ever<br>had are in ports keep it a secret<br>because they're also quite dangerous but<br>you can see the complexity and some of<br>these habitats both in the<br>native but also in the human created<br>habitats 39 ports were sampled between<br>95 and 2002 and I'd say you know when I<br>first arrived in Australia our knowledge<br>base stated that were sitting there were<br>62 species recognized as non-native in<br>marine and estuary environments by the<br>time we finished we had detected 248 in<br>the port surveys themselves and 629 in<br>total when we finished looking at the<br>museums and we finished looking at the<br>literature so an order of magnitude<br>change in our understanding on the basis<br>of both an effort that was applied in<br>terms of previous knowledge as well as<br>new knowledge now the one thing that you<br>can see from this slide the red<br>indicates introduced the green is<br>cryptogenic is that there's a definite<br>north-south pattern the tropical ports<br>do not appear to have as many invaders<br>or cryptogenic species the temperate<br>ports have more and of course off on the<br>side there the target and investigation<br>in Port Phillip Bay is swamp eng<br>everybody now the interesting thing<br>about that of course is that if we take<br>into account the taxonomic uncertainty<br>the species for which there are no Latin<br>binomials the species for which they<br>have never been sampled before we can<br>see that the vast majority of those in<br>some case more than fifty percent of the<br>total samples collected in the tropical<br>locations are unknown so that textile<br>McCann certainty can definitely<br>influenced our knowledge in terms of<br>what is likely to come forward and I'd<br>also note the Lewin current moves<br>southward and brings tropical species<br>into Perth so it's the only southward<br>facing current on the west coast of a<br>continental margin so having done<br>Australia we decided that we needed to<br>have an understanding of what could<br>possibly contribute to arrival in those<br>locations as a consequence of global<br>assessment was undertaken which we<br>finished in 2012<br>we basically searched the black<br>literature the peer-reviewed literature<br>the grey literature the web-based<br>knowledge we tapped into our colleagues<br>and networks and basically took all of<br>those samples and applied them into this<br>is en suite of bioregions we use the<br>bioregions largely because the time lag<br>between the finding and detection and<br>publication is often years sometimes<br>decades so the opportunity for spread is<br>quite significant we felt this was the<br>most conservative method to undertake<br>further assessment a thousand data<br>sources were used we found globally that<br>there have been about 2,400 species<br>recognized as invaders in the system<br>several are in freshwater habitats I<br>might mention but they do penetrate into<br>what we would consider saline<br>environment so they were counted in this<br>context we also know that this is out of<br>date 2013 we found another couple of<br>hundred species we haven't recorded<br>those yet and I would imagine 2014 and<br>2015 would be the same but if we start<br>looking at the distribution we can see<br>that 35 phyla are are represented in the<br>invasion literature ninety-five percent<br>of our are in the the phyla that I<br>represent here the 14 phyla and<br>fifty-five percent of them are found in<br>three final alone the crustaceans the<br>mollusks and the chordates all<br>bioregions have been invaded including<br>Antarctica and the Arctic and<br>forty-seven percent of the total<br>invasions are found either in the<br>Mediterranean or in Australia New<br>Zealand so these are the hot spots of<br>receiving non-native species in this<br>instance of course this is predicated<br>upon the knowledge base that exists and<br>as you saw with concerted effort we had<br>an order of magnitude shift in Australia<br>one would imagine some of these other<br>regions would have the same kind of<br>shift in terms of their knowledge base<br>so the hazard analysis indicates 2,400<br>species that are<br>but of course most species many native<br>species would be able to be transported<br>but they haven't yet as a consequence<br>these are the the nutty and risk the<br>unknown unknowns in the Rumsfeld Ian<br>context I think it's a safe assumption<br>all though to say that those species<br>that have already participated in the<br>invasion process are most likely to<br>continue to participate so if we move to<br>consequence assessment again this<br>depends on the endpoint of choice and<br>the acceptable level of protection the<br>more protection you want the more cost<br>that will be will be entailed excuse me<br>so if a quarantine endpoint is selected<br>then that's an easy one the consequences<br>that any species that arrives is going<br>to be deemed to be a high risk but of<br>course government will probably not do<br>that public monies are limited we don't<br>have the ability to manage 24 hundred<br>species plus the unknowns therefore<br>we're going to look at the impact that<br>they're likely to cause and of course<br>the impact in those values means that we<br>have a significant amount of work that<br>we have to do before we can demonstrate<br>guilt the difficulty of course is that<br>for more than seventy percent of species<br>seventy percent of the introduced<br>species we have no information about<br>impact and indeed if we restrict<br>ourselves to an experimental a<br>scientifically valid determination of<br>impact then ninety percent of species<br>have insufficient information to be able<br>to say that they're causing a problem<br>now that's not to say that they don't<br>cause a problem it's that we do not have<br>the sufficient information to<br>demonstrate it now likelihood assessment<br>which transport vectors are most<br>important is the first question that<br>comes forward and of course there are a<br>variety of ways that species can be<br>introduced we can have intentional<br>movements of species through aquaculture<br>through stock enhancement through live<br>seafood trade and accidental release<br>or live seafood transport that is<br>purchased and then released because of<br>cultural awareness we have unintentional<br>transport vessel vessels move both with<br>ballast water and biofouling aquaculture<br>and also with packing materials many of<br>the bait that we purchase is actually<br>grown in farms in Southeast Asia and<br>shipped globally you can easily order it<br>on the internet so based on life history<br>characteristics we can see that forty<br>seven percent of species are associated<br>with biofouling forty four percent of<br>species with vessel biofouling and<br>thirty six percent of species are likely<br>to be through ballast water now vessels<br>therefore are probably one of the most<br>significant mechanisms of movement so if<br>we take that a little further let's talk<br>about ballast water now ballast water<br>isn't a it's came in in place in the<br>19th century when we moved to steal hold<br>vessels from wooden vessels it is used<br>to maintain the trim and stability of<br>the ship and it is especially important<br>in a variety of elements now the key<br>here is that on any given point in time<br>we believe about 7,000 species that are<br>in the plankton are inside the vessels<br>that is if all of that was discharged<br>within ports very clearly you have a<br>huge property low pressure but the key<br>characteristic here is that ballast<br>water is only used during the the<br>portion of the voyage when you don't<br>carry cargo so only a portion of vessels<br>are arriving in ballast in contrast<br>vessel biofouling is associated with all<br>vessels any exposed surface in the water<br>immediately begins to accumulate species<br>and you can see that the internal piping<br>the tanks all of that area is exposed to<br>seawater and therefore accumulate<br>species the the other difference is<br>ballast water started in the 19th<br>century in contrast even the waka that<br>moved around Polynesia<br>carried biofouling species so any<br>exposed area was was moving material all<br>areas of operation collect biofouling<br>species as a consequence it's a<br>concatenation over the period of life<br>between the cleaning and the next<br>cleaning in a commercial context that<br>represents about a five-year cycle so<br>five years worth of voyages accumulate<br>species and discharge them in each port<br>that it moves into the other element of<br>the likelihood assessment very clearly<br>it's how species get on the vector how<br>they survive the transport and how they<br>discharge from the vector but really the<br>number of vessels arriving from regions<br>where the species occurs is most<br>critical if we look at a single years<br>worth of safety of life at sea data we<br>can see that we're a highly connected<br>environment trade drives the global<br>economy and of course Australia New<br>Zealand despite the fact that we're<br>quite distant from other locations are<br>similar in terms of that context so if<br>we undertake an assessment of pathways<br>we can see that as you move the voyage<br>history longer and longer out you begin<br>to sample more and more bioregions until<br>the point after six months you've<br>sampled all bioregions and therefore<br>species from all over the world can<br>arrive so the risk calculation is<br>simplistic likelihood times consequence<br>for the Australian biofouling system we<br>actually detected 59 species that we<br>deemed to be of highest risk and in fact<br>ten of those have subsequently been<br>sampled at the border now it's very<br>interesting because that was<br>sufficiently convincing for them to<br>change their regulatory framework so a<br>couple of cautions risky behaviors<br>vessels that behaved promiscuous ly are<br>likely to be fouled they're likely to<br>have problems long ports days such as<br>what we saw during the global financial<br>crisis is a critical import poor<br>antifouling application the the<br>prevention of material settle<br>on the vessel is likely to have a<br>consequence as well and indeed if we<br>look at newly cleaned vessels and<br>believe that they're safe these are<br>examples of less than 30 days out of dry<br>dock where significant accumulations of<br>species occur and species for which no<br>impact information exists are clearly<br>not representing negligible impact and<br>therefore need to be assessed<br>appropriately lastly the current<br>economic drivers for vessel operators<br>probably coincide with biosecurity<br>interest but they're not sufficient<br>because they're interested solely in the<br>reduction of drag not in delivering to a<br>biosecurity outcome and lastly sometimes<br>things happen vessel sink the Rena goes<br>down and is left in place so I'd like to<br>acknowledge a few people obviously my<br>wife who is also a very significant<br>collaborator professor martin campbell<br>has been intimately involved in a lot of<br>the research that i presented tonight my<br>children otter erica and eileen have<br>been very patient during both my PhD and<br>subsequent years in terms of how much<br>time I've spent away and very clearly<br>the collaborators that I have both<br>overseas as well as the new<br>collaborators here at the University of<br>Waikato so thank you very much and I<br>to move fast for a compelling lecture<br>marine science research and about<br>another frontier the frontier of<br>defending our marine environments so<br>we're really glad Chad the do and money<br>your family otter that you've come back<br>to RT around New Zealand and that you<br>are here to help us in that job of<br>protecting our tarot New Zealand against<br>all those harmful marine organisms and<br>that you're going to help us essentially<br>protect enhance coastal and marine<br>environments I hope you'll join with me<br>once again in thanking Chad and later we<br>will go out to the foyer and I hope that<br>you will join with us to us Chad that<br>question you want to ask him about those<br>invasive marine organisms and how he's<br>going to help us protect the marine<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
