like opened up with<br>this street lights you can't see<br>anything there's no roads there's just<br>so now i'm yellin garage<br>and I'm with my best friend<br>and Morgan's kind of just jump on it<br>feeling you know that feeling is kind of<br>moving<br>not<br>I'm tweeting so much kind of induction<br>throws switch so I'm soaked stage listen<br>to the music love the music that people<br>music I was probably made to<br>I've got a strange kind of Bob one hand<br>raised I ignored my eyes disclosed<br>switch<br>switch<br>so what does this all mean what does<br>this have to do with research so I've<br>taught everyone my name is ebony I'm<br>intensive black with a duck of 10 I had<br>green eyes brown hair a scar on my<br>forehead and a bad right knee the<br>research question that I am exploring is<br>how the dancers search for locate and<br>activate the erating to tease aspect as<br>ebony is a performative picture that<br>travels through multiple performance<br>modalities it's natural to want to know<br>yourself and we often ask ourselves who<br>are we and what does it mean to be me<br>switch issues that I explore within this<br>research include as identity given<br>developed or interwoven come with me as<br>we move through the steps that unpack my<br>identities specific to the study we look<br>at the terms mana Wahine femininity and<br>identity man and molding ethnic identity<br>manatee nana physical identity manaphy<br>noah locational identity Manawa know why<br>you are spiritual identity this research<br>is a quest for self-discovery it's a<br>subjective investigation of the thinking<br>dancer the embodied self the dancing<br>self as Becca's ebony looks at a solo<br>practice as a tool for agency and<br>empowerment for the dancing subject how<br>can I find myself in the complexity of<br>life and all that comes with it I search<br>for this as a dancing spirit as a mover<br>major and rapture<br>search why is this researcher important<br>we asked ourselves we must sell suss out<br>what do we understand is our identity my<br>aim is to create a formula of getting to<br>know oneself oneself as an individual on<br>south as a performer I will apply this<br>to myself to answer my own questions<br>about my identity this process can then<br>be used for others in the performance<br>world and in communities to ultimately<br>strengthen us as a whole this process of<br>self-discovery and forming a strong<br>identity benefits the self in the<br>community by understanding what<br>influences you as an individual and how<br>you can influence others this<br>performance will give people curiosity a<br>drive to know themselves and where they<br>come from allowing people to understand<br>their sense of solidarity and<br>significance of them as an individual<br>giving them a feeling of agency and<br>empowerment switch what do we understand<br>as identities well they are never fixed<br>we are constantly evolving as we<br>experience new things identity formation<br>and maintenance as influenced by one's<br>ethnicity politics location gender class<br>systems environment and numerous other<br>things within this research I aim to<br>investigate how mana and identity can be<br>seen as one thing overlapping each other<br>as we weave a new space for this<br>particular research within this research<br>manner is use an election<br>the ideas of prestige strength dignity<br>binding self-respect and others respect<br>for you switch my moldy culture plays a<br>dominant role and the person I am today<br>how can I weave my understandings<br>mo'fucka Papa my culture and<br>man who Manawa hina can be described as<br>the strength of a woman dance practice<br>nurs such as such as Josephine Baker<br>Vera Montero and gutenbert avisa have<br>helped me shape the money walking out of<br>this research but aiding my confidence<br>and the importance of a solo practice<br>throughout this research I also drawn<br>inspiration from performative mana<br>Wahine such as caprica Louise Portagee<br>Bryant and Jennifer Roche switch the<br>dominant way that people view once<br>identity is physically ones impressions<br>of someone is totally tied up with what<br>they look like in near aesthetic<br>appearance my physical identity allows<br>you as an audience to mock me as a<br>living being you follow my external<br>traits the color of my hair the color of<br>my ebony skin the shade of my eyes the<br>entry of my walk the pattern in my step<br>the Kurds of my waist the quality of my<br>voice the character of my laugh all my<br>oh so famous as it switch when I speak<br>about my quinoa I'm looking in the<br>Association and the deep connection with<br>my land with Papa Tunku ones monthly<br>note can be closely related to landmarks<br>of me eating this is Cox Lee called a<br>PBR my people had describes things such<br>as my mountain my River Mehmed I and so<br>on they are physical elements that<br>ground me to this fifth dear my culture<br>a part of my identity that is a constant<br>switch every individual has a wider way<br>this can be explained as one salt or one<br>spirit my wider was somewhat of an open<br>book I believe it's of great importance<br>to connect once after their own beliefs<br>whilst allowing an open mind towards<br>other people's beliefs this sincere<br>framework will allow me to have an open<br>clear spiritual channel as I move<br>forward in this development development<br>process switch Monifah dorji methodology<br>that ice down using for this research is<br>a coke over Morty solo practice practice<br>Kobo como de can be described as a body<br>of knowledge that intertwines the<br>morning language and the more tea<br>culture a form of a morir identity a<br>philosophy and a practice of being<br>molded as a researcher I bring forth<br>this idea of a cultural relayer in a<br>undressing to then be redressed we must<br>take it upon ourselves to enter we've<br>our cultural knowledge teachings and<br>learnings so that the inherence ease of<br>both European and indigenous multi<br>worldviews can coexist and thrive whilst<br>being acknowledged as different but also<br>enabling him to work together<br>switch I hope that has I moved through<br>the stages of my identity and allows<br>others to be intrigued and understand<br>the strands of their own identity in<br>order for one to feel confident to feel<br>empowerment and to feel a sense of<br>agency and performance and overall<br>society<br>one of those and yeah yes I have this<br>kind of idea of the multiplicity of the<br>south or the Selva so the term identity<br>is is quite problematic because I don't<br>think we all have one identity of<br>identities so there are numerous<br>elements our elements that make up the<br>sulfur but I think this idea of yeah not<br>only weaving the different identities<br>that I have in order to create or find<br>or locate or wherever I am myself I<br>think it's also about winning so many<br>things with in different ways of<br>research methods to suit your own<br>ow<br>okay yeah okay okay yeah so ultimately<br>it this will conclude in a 20 minute<br>performance lecture and that's kind of<br>like a sniffer of what you've just seen<br>put a little bit more expanded and then<br>it will have the half performance<br>picture and then a half-written thesis<br>that will tweet with each other but in<br>regards to my practice I'm kind of just<br>playing with the different modes of<br>dance of speech of visual image and<br>weaving all those together in order to<br>create your silicon up okay do you kind<br>of talk about if I listener or is it<br>yeah I mean I told you as audience if<br>you followed that because I feel like<br>this the whole concept of identity<br>identity is quite complex and as to put<br>it into a performance literature I feel<br>like humans a really good way to give<br>things across so i would like to the<br>outcome to be quite light and then if<br>you really want to go into depth in it<br>I think as a dancer you kind of think a<br>payment let's dance about it and that's<br>great but if you find yourself having a<br>picture for public speaking of things<br>that that's how i came across this idea<br>of a performance picture but in trying<br>to also make it original and myself than<br>not being so linear as an IM going to<br>give you a performative shoulder self<br>you know so mixing the two together has<br>been I'm really fun really really fun<br>and it's rapid research should be it<br>should be fun you should enjoy it so I<br>am enjoying making making my performance<br>and using my strengths in my different<br>selves to find whatever it is that's<br>it's different it's really difficult to<br>doubt and enter the different parts of<br>yourself it's it's pretty emotional and<br>it's quite i find myself self critiquing<br>quite a lot which is probably not the<br>best thing to do but I mean you can't<br>help it in these things that I come<br>across that may be at someone that my<br>sister has made this observation about<br>myself I'm thinking and I really is that<br>really me so I don't know i think it's<br>an it's actually quite emotional to be<br>open-minded about everything that i am<br>finding yeah that's probably the biggest<br>struggle with this research at the<br>moment is being the subject of the<br>research you know i made like how i went<br>from doing research with other people<br>have the dancers and now i am their<br>research so that's yeah that's quite up<br>don't you like it yeah well originally<br>it was challenges but due to time<br>constraints you have driven all better<br>yeah something I thought was quite funny<br>thanks funny at all yeah both of us dead<br>yeah what if he wants you to put it</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
