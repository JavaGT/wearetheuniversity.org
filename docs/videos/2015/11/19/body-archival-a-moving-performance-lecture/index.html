minimalistic<br>devices my activity you can call it what<br>you will as sharing an invocation of the<br>past you can remember it however you<br>want welcome to a lovely abundance of<br>specificity welcome to my loss struggles<br>jubilations epiphanies a distractions of<br>the dancing kind personally are from<br>welcome to this space this room and then<br>your presence my body you're witnessing<br>to that body the body that doesn't lie<br>or does it welcome to the truth the part<br>I'm remembering so many context of<br>movement maybe they all blend together<br>that was in and this is now and now<br>embedded with the disarray of files male<br>of liquid pouring into one another I can<br>feel the slush of surface information<br>tilting me towards asking what do I do<br>with it I mean perfectly it's me but not<br>me give me and so much more than me<br>thanks to you I'm your apparatus of<br>capture I have perceived organized and<br>distributed your information and perhaps<br>some of your significance as I see fit<br>but what is in this slippery storage is<br>the history swooned by the histrionics<br>does it retain the mundanity does it<br>clearly store the confusion or does it<br>confuse the clarity was it your aura<br>that impressed me in any case making a<br>dance with you was always engaging such<br>compositions of dexterity scenes of<br>hilarity days of venality and<br>interpretations of unending delight but<br>how did you imprint yourself or rather<br>how did I imprint you terms and meanings<br>seem to restrict and render you<br>incorrectly my dear no matter what<br>wherever you are whatever you are I will<br>always love you<br>fell across the crowded world you drew<br>me in Shenmue Z me towards the other<br>mean another way to be I felt your<br>breath on my neck and I was swayed<br>that's what they say whether it was done<br>dear European dance community it's been<br>a long time since we said goodbye on<br>that cold autumn day some days you seem<br>so very close and each time you slip<br>back into my existence I asked where is<br>it start where does it stop this dance<br>between you and me do you remember when<br>you took my hand and spun me around and<br>then with fast articulate and hand<br>movements and legwork our bodies<br>collided in a full adventurous<br>partnering sliding on our script the<br>game seemed relentless until suddenly I<br>was rejected isolated sitting on a razor<br>edge of attraction and repulsion the<br>rock band played on and after many<br>throwing objects we lay there huffing<br>and puffing to the backdrop of a filmic<br>myth what a lusty start to our dance<br>which shifted quickly to a<br>professionalism and an ongoing service<br>to your cause your kingdom your body pal<br>such charismatic Authority your<br>disciples were extraordinary they shared<br>such virtuosic tricks in this kind of<br>dance lost interest in my bones for now<br>but I remember one thing is I remember<br>the smell was dis da strong<br>in case it was the last time that altima<br>dear shoo-shoo ledger you have deeply<br>inquisitions my bones these bones so<br>porous that absorb your features and<br>incorporate them into my conceptual<br>apparatus to mingle with this physiology<br>the unidentifiable then bleed out again<br>into the hemisphere of a career<br>sometimes in a fury of leverage<br>sometimes in an abstract pedestrian ism<br>sometimes you've created in mobility you<br>clear within you the depths you reach<br>featherly without my knowledge perhaps<br>it's in your genes a technology role by<br>your culture your politic your social<br>celebrations and where strength don't<br>d golden ratio and roses please keep on<br>running and spiraling and leave him in<br>the most five suits and dear Flemish<br>franco-belgian dance communities the<br>years i sat on the French's side but my<br>strong physical Dance interspersed with<br>a brute theatre the performers were raw<br>they were ugly to be honest they were<br>honest to be ugly dear ethical you see<br>her you New Zealand lady show me<br>something interesting from your country<br>you also made me wear toilet paper star<br>on my face and thighs doesn't my tongue<br>sticking out and poses dictators and<br>sexual positions and I asked myself how<br>did I give you was it something I said<br>actually it was something you said and<br>many times over something you didn't say<br>the weight of what was not spoken off<br>dear hands you said just find what it is<br>for yourself fear I said what is it I<br>don't have enough information please<br>didn't realize that the answer was<br>already happening I didn't realize I was<br>the answer<br>I was responsible for how this would go<br>it was liberating and frightening it<br>also broke down the letter to reassemble<br>checking back with kinetic frame in<br>constant flux arrival at an osprey end<br>of limitation and shifting the<br>consistency of textual data clinics<br>trace the license or awareness with the<br>earth energy anthem as the plan thing<br>tests direction the motorized to<br>surrender twisting and it will able easy<br>updos for to collide to move back to<br>did your own oh so conflict on<br>excellence of the key maybe I ought to<br>be up here where there is not even a<br>hint of adapting their really had a shot<br>of Arthur all I mean how much one can<br>you extract from the next of removal<br>anything I hope there is not a lot of<br>mormons dear performance please don't go<br>don't disappear again begin only how can<br>I keep you how can I make you stay you<br>I'm trying to find an arrangement with<br>the deranged here well maybe I should<br>just subconsciously select and deselect<br>when it's useful dear all my<br>choreography Zen improvisations I can<br>feel your pool for me to love you<br>unconditionally yet you are filled with<br>unfinished business to whom it may<br>concern here lies the depth of so many<br>movements Sun captured here lies the<br>works never finished here lies the<br>whoops never started he lies the lies<br>here lies a dead of choreography please<br>yeah I think I've always got this idea<br>what the premise of instinct is really<br>useful when you're drawing on your own<br>personal kind of storage or because it's<br>so subjective to me think that what I<br>allowed myself to do and it's<br>interesting I didn't really take time to<br>reflect on that teen years ahead in<br>Europe and so when it came to this<br>project that was really like oh yeah I<br>can do this now and without censoring<br>anything I just allowed what was kind of<br>organically coming forward and it was<br>interesting what was coming forward so<br>my process was listening to that what<br>stories what memories came out and often<br>it wasn't anything to do with movement<br>and was more about the way in which<br>people were kind of operating in war<br>different modes or just different kinds<br>of contrasting experiences that yeah<br>sort of struck me so that was one thing<br>the premise of instant but yeah I think<br>it was also a really interesting process<br>to look at what I guess what is<br>happening concurrently with dance and<br>its evolution how people are approaching<br>processes with dance and opening up that<br>field to so many other disciplines and I<br>think for me there was also this part of<br>the methodology was to really approach<br>what it meant to be in this zone of<br>memory talking mean I have my Achilles<br>broken at the time I did the originals<br>00 didn't quite make it a dump you know<br>the dance<br>at least but it was yeah it was a<br>process that was about trying to<br>incorporate and into almost like a<br>quite nicely sure yeah originally it was<br>the 2025 minute and lick sure so I've<br>got a lot of things got taken out which<br>was quite hard to do because a lot of<br>things were referencing other things<br>that there was a lot more related to<br>that franco-belgian as well as the<br>Flemish side and the different<br>choreographers and it really highlighted<br>those experiences and the ways I was<br>interpreting them and taking on board<br>information yeah so it's a bit of a job<br>ya body<br>and then<br>yeah and I want there's many things what<br>constructing the material yeah Phyllis<br>avocados intercept comes Erin meaning is<br>this really lovely right time to start<br>mobile architecture that couldn't<br>elasticity and to think I was inspired a<br>lot by there as an idea and Carol and at<br>the time is helping me also had some<br>reference isn't year that the the liquid<br>thing became so it was an interesting<br>state to explore the information that it<br>was all kind of crossing over into one<br>another to be honest I don't really<br>remember many actual dance movements<br>from shows but I remember lots of layers<br>of stuff that went on and definitely<br>tensions or intentions and and and<br>obviously the things that were more<br>strongly ethically kind of difficult for<br>me came forward as well so yeah gehen<br>again it was really a natural kind of<br>process for opening it up and allowing<br>those things to do really a ugly or<br>pretty heads you know if they do so<br>there was a liquid sensation to that<br>process which I feel is where I'm really<br>at the moment really listening to how<br>things evolve when you've already done<br>kind of quite a chunk of stuff you know<br>you kind of feel like oh I just stopped<br>and listened to it it's actually going<br>to feed me and I think this is<br>reaffirming also possibly a process for<br>dancers engaging and choreography's and<br>how they also can you be useful there<br>hoping of the<br>the agency of the dancer that that<br>usefulness they have as people and what<br>they've done we do is yeah it's not too<br>strong well with at the end of the<br>performance it's always like I'm<br>standish that's it you know gone but<br>years experience like that are<br>completely because I'm not Europe hear<br>that yeah for sure for sure I mean I<br>don't think I'll start hello no watch<br>I'd run but that's why no mames oh yeah<br>oh well anyway you remind me away a free<br>time to write it down it's so cool I'm a<br>subatomic particle yeah because they to<br>meet they head of consciousness yeah yes<br>yeah you're right and then I say in this<br>space I've been named particularly the<br>cells ever to the next religion and your<br>their next dimension oh wow awesome so I<br>loving this is great<br>your relationships that the enemy you're<br>bringing you there thanks to Mexico yeah<br>yeah well that and that was filmed that<br>most of that I was quite strict on what<br>I took and as far as the images and I<br>kept it to this one place that I was in<br>on the last the last study I did when I<br>was in Europe and I just went this is<br>I'm going to use this information and<br>not be searching through all my archives<br>for things that was the last moment I<br>was improvising and and I think that<br>whole thing of the this other dimension<br>and the space I inhabited then and now<br>it's quite it is quite an interesting<br>channel for me back to that and it's and<br>it's also interesting there was a piece<br>I couldn't include which was a letter to<br>briefs Lou Who who did a piece called<br>gravitation which you would love because<br>it was absolutely it's all about<br>circling and gravitational atomic kind<br>of movements and it's kept going and<br>even the audience at the end and the<br>lights went up and the dancers continued<br>doing their thing you know in this<br>beautiful lighting and the audience was<br>just leave like and they just keep going<br>i SAT there for another 10 minutes<br>watching it going they're not they're<br>not going to stop so anyway I want I<br>couldn't include it because of the time<br>but it was a very impressive impactful<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
