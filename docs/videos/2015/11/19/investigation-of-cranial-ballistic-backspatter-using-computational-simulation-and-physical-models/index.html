could not overcome the<br>grief from loss of his parents and<br>committed a suicide leaving all his<br>money to me however unbeknownst to me<br>there was a research going in New<br>Zealand that ultimately became my<br>downfall the research looks at<br>development of artificial models using<br>computer simulation to look at cranial<br>tax better so what is cranial backs<br>better when you see movies and stuff you<br>see a massive amount of blood shot I'm<br>spattering in direction of the bullet<br>away from the shooter however it is not<br>a common knowledge that there is a small<br>amount of spatter spattered back towards<br>the shooter the reverse direction<br>knology gives its name back spatter back<br>better is an important piece of forensic<br>evidence because of the information that<br>it can provide to the crime scene<br>investigators it can inform fire related<br>factors and biological factors the fire<br>related factors that affect back spatter<br>our caliber of the bullet type of<br>firearm<br>and the proximity of the shot the<br>biological factors include the location<br>of the shot so how does this actor into<br>crime solving well if no bullets were<br>found from the currency or multiple<br>bullets were found you would like to<br>know which one did the damage was this<br>handgun found on the crime scene did the<br>crime or was it the shotgun was it a<br>suicide point-blank range nor shot from<br>one meter away by maybe somebody else<br>and if the body is absent from the crime<br>scene was it shot on the limbs or was it<br>shot on the head or in the body arm in<br>the liver losing a lot of blood any way<br>to investigate back spatter first you<br>had to create a computational model of a<br>live person based on MRI the MRI Mona<br>was composed of three main parts which<br>represent the three main layers of human<br>head the break the skull and the spot<br>this general model once created can be<br>rapidly prototype and personalized to<br>fit the geometry of the victim's head<br>this personalization is very important<br>because no two heads are the same if you<br>have a bigger head you might suffer from<br>bigger that's better so once the model<br>was established the information<br>collected from the crime scene was fed<br>into a simulation to create the space<br>this computer simulation has a<br>presidental advantage over the<br>conventional animal models or mannequins<br>this does not suffer from ethical issues<br>or it is very cost effective every time<br>you shoot a mannequin you might have to<br>pay for it but this as long as you have<br>a computer to run it's free also it has<br>very fast turn our time and accuracy in<br>both simulating conducting the<br>experiment and analyzes so when the<br>sparrows were simulated the spattered<br>particles were calculated for its<br>approximate trajectory bear in mind the<br>air drink blood viscosity and the<br>gravitational the final trajectory<br>calculated was then fed into the crime<br>based on that final special it was<br>confirmed that the bullet found at the<br>crime scene 9 millimeter was indeed the<br>culprit the gun found in the head of the<br>victim did the crime was looking good<br>I did not expect the proximity of the<br>shot to turn out to be 1 meters proving<br>that there was a second person the<br>anatomical location of the shot was<br>undoubtedly the head because the body<br>was there but then one meter really did<br>not do the work for me which led to the<br>arrest of the main suspect which will<br>lead to a positive conviction in the<br>who helped with the research and the<br>play hope you learn something about<br>minor search my name is Erin and this is<br>a future of crime-solving that my<br>white I was interested in identical<br>the conversation that arose from what<br>was camping in Otago and then that the<br>then how much how much they keep it will<br>issue the most about it well first of<br>all regardless of the ethical problem<br>peeps don't really have an exact<br>geometry that matches human head however<br>in order to do any simulation or any<br>modeling work you need a validation<br>dorito that's similar to human and the<br>pigs were actually chosen for that<br>purpose that is actually part of our<br>group work and it wasn't a really a good<br>time getting that kind of publicity a<br>bad past university at xsport it was<br>very humanely done it was done in 2009 I<br>really don't understand why all the fuss<br>is getting up now and we don't plan any<br>more animal experimentation because<br>we're going to get maximize all the data<br>that we've acquired back then to create<br>something like this so hopefully because<br>of the pigs happened this can happen to<br>thanks very invasive there's nobody else<br>looking at this this type of phone one<br>week so I don't know how much of a<br>background I have to go back but<br>conventional finite elements analyzes<br>does not handle fragmentation gracefully<br>and ballistic impact is a very high<br>speed and high energy which means the<br>computational mathematical framework<br>doesn't really handle things and it's<br>now like only now became available that<br>the supercomputer cluster can perform<br>these calculations that's accurate<br>enough for us these things are take<br>about 200 gigabyte RAM and your<br>terabytes of data space and weeks and<br>even months of computer time yeah five<br>your methodology or have you aim the<br>collected data and how do you put it<br>so I actually make the physical models<br>the man say mannequins and I you shoot<br>them and then collect high-speed data<br>and based on the high-speed data I<br>collected the frames each frame showing<br>like how the deformation of the surface<br>is happening I try to mimic that as<br>close as possible and so that's pretty<br>much my methodology which would be able<br>to slow down so this research is backed<br>by ESR which is our crime lab of New<br>Zealand so hopefully it will be of a<br>little help yes at the moment ESR is<br>being consulted about the back spatter<br>evidence from our neighbor the<br>Australian court so with more scientific<br>research done this will have more<br>that is the grand vision this is I come<br>about 10th year into this group research<br>and we're hoping that like one day you<br>scan the crime scene with some kind of a<br>Ghostbuster set up and then scan the<br>spatter pattern and feed it into an<br>analyzer and it's a yes well it was<br>probably done this much range and with<br>this bullet maybe potentially one of<br>these pistols so something magical like<br>that might happen in the future um well<br>I put the 2018 as a preliminary date for<br>the video but hopefully I'm strongly<br>hoping for a real-world application was<br>it quite quite straightforward to<br>translate the dark Americans into the<br>computer model sorry what some of the<br>main challenges were in there no because<br>you have to get around the basics of the<br>framework if the mathematical modeling<br>cannot handle the deformation and stuff<br>you have to program your own material<br>card and not many people have the<br>biological material card suitable for a<br>brain and bone and stuff and everybody<br>has different material property for<br>their own biological tissue so that is a<br>challenge to personalize things in a<br>fast enough setup but at the moment<br>we're just still struggling to get the<br>basic backbone of the software up and<br>running<br>and then worry about the little tweaking<br>I have a few questions obviously makes<br>me hear you make your own mannequins to<br>use them for the simulation so is that<br>in the software or did you actually have<br>to make vitaly make yes so i spent here<br>weeks in the lab pouring down staff and<br>try to deem old stuff it's made using a<br>composite material and using cast on<br>technique so I cast polyurethane boat<br>with the silicone skin and gelatin brain<br>which is conventional simulant materials<br>used in a ballistic testing around the<br>world we shoot them twice a year kind of<br>frequency all of my hats are named my<br>other question was you're saying that it<br>does take a lot of computational power<br>to actually get the status so<br>potentially if you were actually looking<br>to work for the crime scene and become<br>looking at a few weeks of actually<br>getting your data that would there be<br>potential to do something like something<br>like render farms or anything to actual<br>speed up this process um ultimately I'm<br>hoping to get a lookup table so unless<br>you're very austere for us his old male<br>that's out of the data table you can<br>quickly look up reasonable data in the<br>table and zoning on the stuff and then<br>if a further analysis is required then<br>you can request for a special case of<br>simulation right yeah but we definitely<br>look into<br>thank you so this is yes<br>so<br>that takes the field and<br>thing of the human scalp especially<br>under ballistic impact they behave very<br>similarly to internet so we actually<br>shot some animal heads as well like as<br>mentioned before to match the ballistic<br>data so it does look and feel quite<br>similar and comparable in weight as well<br>to actual human head is at the moment<br>the location of impact is the right<br>temple because most of the court cases<br>are based on discerning suicide from<br>homicide whether I was it staged suicide<br>or a genuine suicide so that's like most<br>popular a suicide location if you need<br>difference in the same design<br>I put there myself odd for a company and<br>in the evening there was the back hi<br>while eating thanks and some of the<br>employees with climate and steal all the<br>the gloves so when they they come here<br>they something that no one here so<br>parents on Planet of this side of this<br>face and stops that a packet of blood<br>and in the morning you were told they<br>know who the culprit was because when he<br>didn't know if they separated the<br>lifting gloves from the writing class<br>they put the left hand gloves here Nora<br>hand got way over there and then I<br>thought they were getting measuring pits<br>are looking for one person said he has<br>holy water I think um this is like going<br>to be published so if found the<br>criminals care to read international<br>journal of legal medicine unfortunately<br>any more questions I think my time is up</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
