font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so Margaret congratulations on winning<br>the Pickering medal it's number one a<br>huge honor and really exciting to see a<br>female role model actually winning this<br>award so tell me how you're feeling oh<br>pretty good about it I think I have to<br>check the records but I think I'm the<br>first woman to win that award so that<br>feels really special um<br>and it feels special too because it's<br>research that I'm really passionate<br>about this is a great opportunity to<br>kind of recognize the work that's been<br>done in the light medals Research Center<br>because the award is for research that<br>we did on fluide emissions in aluminium<br>smelting and so what's unique about this<br>award is it's Award recogniz of research<br>of Technology at an international scale<br>so let's talk a little bit about the<br>international scale of this what your<br>experience was where you went what<br>you've done well interestingly the<br>research and its application actually<br>started in New Zealand so this is<br>technology that's being used in the<br>aluminium smelting industry in terms of<br>aluminium smelting there are really two<br>centers of excellence one is in Norway<br>and one in is in New Zealand so the<br>research that's done in the light metals<br>Research Center is in demand globally<br>and you've had a fantastic year Michelle<br>it's been busy the medal so tell us tell<br>us about that I'm really honored to have<br>the kalahan medal and it's it's really<br>topped off an incredible two years for<br>me um in science communication obviously<br>it's a full-time academic I do science<br>full-time but being able to talk about<br>the science at a level that anybody can<br>understand has been a real passion of<br>mine to help people understand the<br>difference between peer-reviewed<br>scientific articles and a Facebook post<br>that may or may not have good science<br>behind it has been has been a real<br>passion because I get lots of members of<br>the public asking me is this true can<br>you give me advice on this how do I<br>research certain things organic food<br>vaccination for kids climate change are<br>the three top ones that I get and being<br>able to find good sources I think is<br>important it's been an incredible year<br>and I'm humble and grateful and and like<br>yours it's it's a team environment so<br>the science Media Center I'm not the<br>only science Communicator there's a<br>whole group of us working together to<br>create this momentum towards Making<br>Science interesting and accessible and<br>available to all you go out to a lot of<br>schools you have the opportunity to<br>speak to lots of kids from lots of<br>different backgrounds what are the key<br>messages that that you get out to them<br>about science engineering and science we<br>do have an issue with diversity and and<br>I'm really passionate about making sure<br>that there's a full pipeline I go out to<br>schools and just show people how excited<br>and passionate I am about what I do and<br>why and a lot of what I do is applied<br>research you can see a solution it's the<br>same as you know why you're doing what<br>you're doing it's it's seeing that<br>solution from from an idea that you had<br>let kids in school kids see that science<br>is everywhere it's all around them it's<br>not just in a lab it's not just in a<br>test tube and it can answer some really<br>interesting questions about how the<br>world Works around them they want to<br>make a career out of that then go study<br>science or engineering at University as<br>women Engineers as we both are how does<br>that play into into what you do and into<br>the communications message as women<br>Engineers sadly we still in the minority<br>but it's a it's a growing minority and I<br>I think both you and I have work really<br>hard to be positive role models and<br>showcase what it is to be a woman<br>engineer I think there's always this<br>horrible stereotype of hard hats and<br>steel toat boots of which neither of us<br>wear on a full-time basis and also a<br>diversity and personalities so when I<br>thought of women Engineers I'll admit I<br>thought of a certain stereotype of which<br>neither of us fit we're feminine we're<br>fun we have personalities and lives<br>outside of engineering and I think it's<br>really important to be strong role<br>models and showcase that there is<br>diversity I'd have to Ree and I I've<br>spent most of my career you as you have<br>working in the minority um and one of<br>the things that I've really learned is<br>that you just do it your own way you<br>don't have to do it the way the blokes<br>do it<br>you yeah you you bring that femininity<br>to it and you bring that different</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
