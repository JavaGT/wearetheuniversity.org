um it's a great it's a great<br>pleasure to be here and an honor to uh<br>to start the proceedings<br>um thanks to all for being here uh thank<br>you ozan for your kind invitation and<br>your kind words and I'm I'm really<br>looking forward to the presentations uh<br>today and tomorrow and um this building<br>of relationships which I think is uh is<br>the purpose of this of this event that<br>we start some conversations we<br>consolidate and build uh towards<br>um more successful work in the future<br>um<br>today I want to I want to speak to the<br>conference theme of social movements<br>resistance and social change and taking<br>uh as my lead the the problem of what is<br>possible<br>I take it that um most of us here are<br>concerned with political agency<br>concerned and puzzled by the problem of<br>political agency<br>with the formation and elaboration of<br>political subjectivity which is Ln bed<br>you specifies involves a problem of the<br>principle of orientation towards a truth<br>procedure<br>I'll speak then of principles of<br>orientation today orientation for<br>radical thought radical philosophy and<br>for political activism<br>orientation towards what<br>towards capital and the 21st century<br>which I will designate as our problem<br>when I speak of capital in the 21st<br>century I'm referring both to this<br>little book by Thomas picketty which<br>goes by that title and the book has I<br>guess you're probably all aware of it<br>and hopefully some of you have read it<br>it's been widely discussed in the uh in<br>the business press and and Beyond has<br>been noticed uh by uh politicians around<br>the world and and hopefully will be that<br>that reason that I'm referring to book<br>will make sense but the other reference<br>of this capital in the 20 uh first<br>century is to do with that object of<br>social criticism the object which we are<br>focused on here<br>um<br>I'm going to read the paper is um<br>somewhat uh heavy hopefully we won't all<br>fall asleep after uh after lunch and the<br>only other caveat I will make is that I<br>will not insert little quotation marks<br>but I'll be quoting a heavily as we go<br>through from uh from Piketty and from<br>others I won't sign all their quotations<br>but do ask me if I'm quoting or not<br>foreign<br>toward the end of the preface to the<br>phenomenology of spirit<br>clearly anticipating the reception of<br>all sizable books and not only his own<br>Hegel emphasizes the hard work required<br>by thinking<br>he presents the activity of philosophy<br>as a strenuous exertion<br>one that always struggles against the<br>cheap and easy seductions of received<br>wisdom<br>also against sensualism and Romanticism<br>and against the idea that understanding<br>could be achieved on the basis of brute<br>sense perception alone<br>he therefore writes with biting wit and<br>here I quote<br>no matter how much someone asks for the<br>Royal Road to science no more convenient<br>and comfortable way can be suggested to<br>him than to put his trust in healthy<br>common sense and then for what else<br>remains to advance simply with the times<br>and with philosophy read reviews of<br>philosophical Works perhaps even go so<br>far as to read the prefaces in the first<br>paragraphs of The Works themselves after<br>all the preface provides the general<br>principles on which everything turns and<br>the reviews provide both the historical<br>memoranda and the critical assessment<br>which because it is a critical<br>assessment exists on a higher plane than<br>what it assesses<br>one can of course Traverse this ordinary<br>consistent with hegel's constant<br>insistence against the Greek<br>presupposition<br>the philosophy is a kind of work<br>available only to those who are afforded<br>a life of leisure Hegel is dismissive of<br>the shortcuts that are taken by those<br>who imagine that philosophy might come<br>easily<br>this is parody of the comfortable Repose<br>of this figure in the dressing gown<br>which of course appears in the first of<br>Descartes meditations<br>it's in this context that Hegel writes<br>true thoughts and scientific Insight can<br>only be won by the labor of the concept<br>the late this labor of the concept<br>involves the most patient care and runs<br>against the Temptations of the day<br>it involves resisting Russian to<br>judgment and leaping ahead of one's<br>material rather than staying with what<br>he calls the matter at hand the thing<br>that matters this hegel's apparently<br>paradoxical argument that the easiest<br>thing of all is to pass judgment what a<br>substantial and meaningful it is much<br>more difficult to get a real grip on it<br>here Hegel stresses the need to struggle<br>against seeing in a book or in the work<br>of a thinker something that is merely<br>either true or false in its entirety<br>science for Hegel is something very<br>different from the inspiration which<br>begins immediately like a shot from a<br>pistol as he says with absolute<br>knowledge<br>which is already finished with all the<br>other standpoints simply by declaring<br>that it will take no notice of them<br>Hegel therefore argues in His science of<br>logic in relation to the idea of what a<br>refutation of the philosophical system<br>would be he says we must get over the<br>distorted idea that the system has to be<br>represented as if thoroughly false and<br>as if the true system stood to the false<br>as only opposed to it<br>by contrast he says effective refutation<br>must infiltrate the opponent's<br>stronghold and meet him on his own<br>ground<br>there is no point in attacking him<br>outside his territory in claiming<br>jurisdiction where he is not<br>these demands from Hegel this is two<br>centuries ago these demands have a<br>remarkable durability maybe in this<br>mediated age as well of online reviews<br>and blogs and Amazon analyzes of books<br>there is also a short version of this a<br>summary version for executives<br>hagel's remarks have durability because<br>of the seductions that lie in the ease<br>of speed reading and the small victories<br>that can be seized by focusing on<br>particulars from an abstract outside<br>against this the effort to transcend a<br>system from within marks some of the<br>most productive appropriations of Hegel<br>and radical philosophy and radical<br>politics through the 19th and 20th<br>centuries<br>and I will argue retain vital lessons<br>for radical philosophy and radical<br>politics in the 21st<br>for now let it be said that the first<br>point of orientation I'm proposing is to<br>work with the matter at hand rather than<br>shoot right past it<br>is on such grounds on the grounds of the<br>thing that possibilities can arise<br>the position of the Lonely outside is<br>satisfying a satisfying delusion but a<br>delusion nonetheless<br>of course at some point we have to<br>decide but decisions should not be made<br>in advance is dirida once put it when I<br>try to decipher a text I do not<br>constantly ask myself if I'll finish by<br>answering yes or no as happens at France<br>at determined periods of history and<br>generally on Sundays<br>in the it's in these terms that I<br>propose to read the prospects for<br>transcending capital in the 21st century<br>I take as grounds the already present<br>possibilities for Transcendence and<br>locate a politics of emancipation in<br>reading and acting on the situation as<br>it is<br>the first half of the paper offers a<br>reading of Thomas picketty's capital in<br>the 21st century in which I stress the<br>moments of transcendence from within<br>that exist in this work but are<br>generally missed because of the in<br>readings of his book because of the<br>effort to take a position safely inside<br>or outside his book The crucial matter<br>is the kind of orientation that one has<br>to a book such as picketies and to<br>economics more generally<br>and also with this the kind of<br>orientation that we might have to<br>Capital and its representation more<br>generally<br>maintaining with Piketty that the<br>Transcendence of capital from within is<br>again today on the cards the second half<br>of the paper therefore turns the<br>question of where the Transcendence of<br>on a casual reading with a maiden one's<br>dressing gown or an evening dress or if<br>one were to take up the many easy<br>opinions circulating in the media<br>picketty's book might be taken to have<br>little to say to either the gritty<br>demands of social movements or the heady<br>Heights of radical philosophy<br>the book can after all be read as<br>attractive depoliticizing policy advice<br>proposing nothing more than a centrally<br>administered tax increase that all<br>well-meaning progressives already<br>support and that none in power would in<br>any way countenance<br>here I want to argue against this<br>reading not so much in order to defend<br>Piketty but rather to propose a relation<br>between social movements economics and<br>philosophy that is not premised on<br>relations of externality Division and<br>separation<br>let us be clear that there are immediate<br>challenges for radical philosophers and<br>for activists reading piketty's book not<br>least of which is the utterly improbable<br>way in which Piketty treats Marx<br>the critique of piketty's reading of<br>Marx is of course incredibly easy and so<br>I should get this out of the way quickly<br>so that we can move on to more serious<br>matters in brief ly conceives capital in<br>a shallow and banal way equating all<br>forms of wealth with capital and<br>therefore deriving any ability to<br>discriminate wealth from for instance<br>industrial or financial Capital Marx is<br>travestied in what Piketty calls the<br>principle of infinite accumulation<br>against which Cricket you might well<br>have actually consulted what Marx wrote<br>about the general law of capitalist<br>accumulation against almost every moment<br>in Marx's text he stands accused of<br>assuming zero productivity and growth in<br>the long run Max is Accused by picity of<br>taking a rather impressionistic and a<br>fairly anecdotal and unsystematic<br>approach to the available statistics by<br>an author whose own demonstrated<br>knowledge of Marx's writings is<br>anecdotal at best and seems to have not<br>even the slightest inkling of the<br>meaning of terms such as primitive<br>accumulation need we say more<br>have no interest in defending Piketty<br>here and the much that is critical could<br>be leveled against the book my goal<br>rather is to invite critics of<br>capitalism out of their hiding behind an<br>abstract model of a mysterious<br>capitalism<br>to turn instead to the realities of<br>intervention against that capitalism<br>which are already underway<br>indeed the critique of piketty's reading<br>of Marx could easily occupy one so much<br>that this would Eclipse everything else<br>in this book and indeed would stand in<br>for the critique of capital<br>for historical materialism the target is<br>not critical criticism of books and<br>ideas but is rather the principled<br>intervention in the actual world so<br>whatever other conclusions we might come<br>to about picketing let it not be<br>forgotten for a second what our Target<br>of criticism is<br>neither should it be forgotten that even<br>beyond the Stark reality that Marx is<br>indeed the most regularly sighted person<br>in the book Marx released a certain<br>Phantom of Marx is indeed the principal<br>theoretical interlocutor of piketty's<br>books<br>look at his book begins and ends with<br>questions regarding the intellectual and<br>political terrain on which debated<br>around the distribution of wealth takes<br>place<br>he stresses that this debate has long<br>been based on an abundance of prejudice<br>and a paucity effect and he bemoans the<br>intellectual laziness of both sides<br>his sources are statistical to be sure<br>but are also theoretical and are far<br>from restricted to economics<br>he argues that the problem of inequality<br>is a problem for the social sciences in<br>general not just for one of its<br>disciplines<br>rather in here I do quote at lengths the<br>truth is that economics should never<br>have sought to divorce itself from the<br>other social sciences and can only<br>advance in conjunction with them<br>the social sciences collectively know<br>too little to waste time on foolish<br>disciplinary squabbles<br>if we are to progress in our<br>understanding of the historical dynamics<br>of the wealth distribution and structure<br>of social classes we must obviously take<br>a pragmatic approach and Avail ourselves<br>of the methods of historians<br>sociologists and political scientists as<br>well as economists disciplinary disputes<br>and turf wars are of little or no<br>importance<br>end quote<br>the kitty also challenges the division<br>of intellectual from political life and<br>concludes that it is illusory I believe<br>to think that the scholar and the<br>citizen live in separate moral universes<br>further he argues it is all too easy for<br>social scientists to remove themselves<br>from public debate and political<br>confrontation and content themselves<br>with the role of commentators on or<br>demolishes of the views and data of<br>others social scientists he says like<br>all intellectuals and all citizens<br>ought to participate in public debate<br>he calls for the intersection of all<br>social scientists all journalists and<br>commentators all activists in the unions<br>and in politics of whatever stripe<br>especially all citizens I mean implicity<br>in its own practice he he writes<br>regularly for um uh for nature French<br>newspapers Le Monde diplomatic<br>liberacion and so forth as well as his<br>practical interventions and Party<br>politics in in France<br>um I don't want to talk about the<br>Practical interventions but really kind<br>of stay focused on on the book which is<br>the thing at hand<br>pickety<br>um okay<br>why does it should be clear that Piketty<br>refuses in advance the separation of the<br>disciplines from one another and the<br>acclaimed separation from politics and<br>their own material conditions<br>it's exactly in the spirit that I'm<br>proposing here to read pikety alongside<br>philosophy and the demands of social<br>movements<br>taking social movements first these<br>arrive to fill in what would otherwise<br>be noticed as a glaring Gap in his<br>analysis which relates to that effective<br>Force towards social change in the<br>absence of mechanical social or economic<br>determination<br>attentive readers will surely wonder why<br>Elites and the systems of global<br>governance that have been oriented<br>towards their interests over recent<br>years would so quickly agree to the<br>demands for extensive new progressive<br>taxation on a global scale recall his<br>proposal Piketty is proposing recall a<br>top tax on income of more than 80<br>percent a progressive global annual tax<br>on individual wealth of around five<br>percent on the largest fortunes perhaps<br>10 annually or higher on the wealth of<br>billionaires to which has added an<br>immediate exceptional tax of for example<br>15 on all private wealth globally in<br>order to immediately eliminate sovereign<br>debt<br>this is the kind of you know why this<br>would come about becomes a problem<br>he certainly does not see this as an<br>automatic process nor is one that will<br>come about without resistance readers of<br>David Harvey will at this point also be<br>recalling Harvey's injunction the<br>accumulation of capital will never cease<br>it will have to be stopped the<br>capitalist class will never willingly<br>surrender its power it will have to be<br>dispossessed<br>is clear that the countervailing forces<br>against the massive concentration of<br>wealth will be concerted Collective<br>action and that the presently<br>constituted state to present serious<br>obstacles towards that action<br>this is in part due to the Persistence<br>of the very idea of the nation state and<br>specifically due to the functioning of<br>the European Union<br>further pikety inquires as to whether<br>the U.S political process has been<br>captured by the one percent<br>particularly does not however<br>immediately issue the state nor does he<br>automatically leap to taxation as a<br>solution he treats in some detail the<br>prospect of deliberately induced<br>inflation in order to eliminate the<br>sovereign debt situation and to devalue<br>privately held wealth<br>he emphasizes the historical novelty of<br>inflation in the 20th century and the<br>role that inflation played in destroying<br>debt this is a fact well known to<br>Liberal and neoliberal economists and<br>therefore a pickity strategy of<br>presenting the inflation card even<br>though he doesn't play it is a carefully<br>calculated move<br>rather than inflation however which<br>brings with it its own dangers and only<br>arbitrarily redistributes wealth bikini<br>turns to tax Leonard attacks on income<br>so much as a tax on wealth which as he<br>notes has always been and increasingly<br>is much more radically unequally<br>distributed than income<br>Texas also preferred by pikety to the<br>physical destruction of wealth that<br>equalize fortunes as a result of the two<br>great Wars of the first half of the 20th<br>century can we imagine he says a 21st<br>century in which capitalism will be<br>transcended in a more peaceful and more<br>lasting way or must we simply await the<br>next Crisis or the next War this time a<br>truly Global one<br>elsewhere he gives the answer to this<br>rhetorical question he writes say remain<br>optimistic and I dream always of a<br>rational and peaceful overcoming of<br>capitalism<br>he stresses adding the force of decision<br>between Alternatives we must decide<br>many people he says will reject the<br>global tax on Capital as a dangerous<br>solution just as the income tax was<br>rejected in its own time a little more<br>than a century ago<br>recall income tax were a novelty at the<br>end of the 19th century<br>when looked at more closely however this<br>is this solution The Tax Solution turns<br>out to be far less dangerous than the<br>Alternatives what is this danger he is<br>alluding to<br>among the dangerous Alternatives is the<br>prospect of doing nothing about the<br>concentration of wealth and the<br>increased and increasing inequality that<br>has expanded globally since the 1970s<br>absent forces to the contrary<br>particularly demonstrates how these<br>levels of concentration and inequality<br>will soon return to level the levels<br>present at the beginning of the 20th<br>century<br>and that these Trends will accelerate in<br>the context of continuing Returns on<br>established wealth and slowing global<br>economic growth<br>now this kicked in from the 60s but is<br>continuing and predicted into the 21st<br>century by most economists hence the<br>formula R is greater than G it's going<br>to create formula in the book which<br>expresses this tendency of the rate of<br>return on Capital to be greater than the<br>rate of economic growth and with this<br>the incrementally but exponentially<br>increasing inequality of wealth over<br>time<br>for peckity the thing that is endangered<br>by rampant inequality is democracy and<br>with this the danger of inequality to<br>Capital is the prospect of Uprising by<br>those most affected by it democracy it<br>should be noted is for Piketty not<br>adequately represented by any regime of<br>technocratic governance or depoliticized<br>Administration these strip out the<br>prospect for Collective deliberation and<br>are thus fundamentally in conflict with<br>democracy<br>expert analysis will never put an end he<br>writes to the violent political conflict<br>that inequality inevitably instigates<br>if it's to put an end to that political<br>conflict fundamentally pose a threat to<br>democracy the nature of which The Argus<br>is conflictual political conflict being<br>on the side of democracy<br>it follows that for pikety democracy<br>will never be supplemented by a republic<br>in this slide it is perhaps unsurprising<br>that Piketty describes Jacques rancier's<br>attitude towards democracy as<br>indispensable<br>in a series of Works Rancier has argued<br>for the foundational place of<br>disagreement in politics<br>that the founding Act of politics is<br>depoliticization and for this reason<br>there is a a basic and foundational<br>hatred of democracy that recoils and<br>horror at the prospect of the<br>expressions of Desire of the people<br>I think if you live in this country you<br>will know what this means<br>it's important to recall romsia's<br>insistence that democracy is an unruly<br>demand<br>but moreover one that since the Greeks<br>has been despised by Elites who have<br>always been the ones who have hated<br>democracy in pickettes framing which<br>targets both ideology and its<br>ideologists no hypocrisy is too great<br>when economic and financial Elites are<br>obliged to defend their interests and<br>that includes economists Who currently<br>occupy an enviable place in the U.S<br>income hierarchy<br>this book displays numerous important<br>resonances with rancier's work both<br>explicitly and implicitly<br>this is clear in piketty's challenging<br>of disciplinary boundaries and as<br>frequent evocations of Jane Austen and<br>honorator Balzac which Echoes the even<br>more daring movements that arancia makes<br>between workers history philosophy<br>Aesthetics political Theory and<br>literature channels for Rancier this<br>very movement of the generic without<br>specific object is the basis of<br>democracy<br>without this kind of context it becomes<br>difficult to understand in the context<br>of particular Frontier it becomes<br>difficult to understand exactly how and<br>why it is that Piketty just distances<br>himself from one particular form of<br>Marxism<br>to some it will come as absolutely no<br>surprise that one of the major<br>conclusions that arises from piketty's<br>historical data is that the first is<br>that one should be wary of any economic<br>determinism in regard to inequality of<br>wealth and income<br>this articulates with the critique of a<br>certain type of Marxism that roncia<br>Associated above all with Louis aldouser<br>and with Pierre bordier<br>against the Inca this incapacitating<br>Marxism we find in Rancier an insistence<br>on the capacity of those who are<br>considered most incapable<br>he emphasizes what is possible when<br>nothing is considered possible and<br>provides a critique of the excessive<br>focus on domination<br>hence rancier's argument that the task<br>of criticism is not the endless<br>demonstration of the omnipotence of the<br>Beast<br>picketty likewise he's nothing natural<br>or inevitable about inequality the<br>demand for equality is a social demand<br>that can be and is made by particular<br>groups in relation to others<br>whom there is no natural spontaneous<br>process to prevent destabilizing in<br>egalitarian forces from from prevailing<br>permanently<br>bronzier finds politics in the most<br>seemingly minor Acts Equity is clear<br>about the stakes of Taxation as he<br>writes taxation is not a technical issue<br>it is preeminently a political and<br>philosophical issue perhaps the most<br>important of all political issues<br>without taxes he writes Society has no<br>common Destiny and Collective action is<br>impossible<br>dangers of not liberating a global tax<br>on Capital Piketty evokes the risks of<br>the formation of a new oligarchy and<br>with this new forms of totalitarianism<br>Rising non-democratic forms of<br>capitalism and of capitalist<br>authoritarianism we see these globally<br>in a number of different countries I'm<br>not just thinking of turkey and China<br>but we see this really Russia as well<br>capitalist and totalitarianism<br>if these threats as seen by Elites and<br>in particular threats to the idea that<br>capitalism is inherently Democratic then<br>these are also threats from the other<br>side these are threats in the form of<br>revolutionary challenges to capitalism<br>as such and this is not the first time<br>that Piketty speaks of in the language<br>of revolution<br>he runs if for example the top decile<br>the top 10 appropriates 90 of each<br>Year's output and the top syntile took<br>50 just for itself as in the case of<br>wealth a revolution will likely occur<br>unless some peculiarly effective<br>repressive apparatus exists to keep it<br>from happening<br>when it comes to the ownership of<br>capital<br>such a high degree of concentration is<br>already a source of powerful political<br>tensions which are often difficult to<br>reconcile with universal suffrage<br>bikini is very clear then about the<br>place of force and consent what are<br>known as repressive and ideological<br>apparatuses in the maintenance of<br>inequality it is impossible he writes to<br>maintain extreme inequalities<br>I quote unless there is a particularly<br>effective system of repression or an<br>extremely powerful apparatus of<br>persuasion or perhaps both<br>I quote again indeed whether such<br>extreme inequality is or is not<br>sustainable depends not only on the<br>effectiveness of the repressive<br>apparatus but also in perhaps primarily<br>on the effectiveness of the apparatus of<br>justification<br>if inequalities are seen as Justified<br>say because they are seen to be a<br>consequence of a choice by the rich to<br>work harder or more efficiently than the<br>poor or because preventing the rich from<br>earning more would inevitably harm the<br>worst off members of society<br>then it is perfectly possible for the<br>concentration of income to set new<br>historical records I want to insist on<br>this point the key issue is the<br>justification of inequality he says<br>rather than its magnitude as such<br>against these justifications of<br>inequality Piketty presents what is<br>possible<br>again the consistency of pikety with<br>roncia is remarkable for Rancier this is<br>what a process of political<br>subjectivation consists in the action of<br>uncounted capacities that crack open the<br>unity of the given and the obviousness<br>of the visible in order to sketch a new<br>Topography of the possible<br>once he stresses throughout his work the<br>fact of bodies existing in the places<br>where they are not supposed to be this<br>is actual this is happening there are<br>spaces in the midst of what is otherwise<br>taken as an impossible situation<br>therefore his formula it is possible<br>the whole ideological struggle between<br>the bourgeoisie and the proletariat is<br>played out there the only song the<br>bourgeoisie has ever sung to the workers<br>is the song of their impotence<br>of the impossibility for things to be<br>different than they are or in any case<br>if the workers and ability to change<br>them<br>tax on wealth for picketing is not an<br>abstract idea which is projected into<br>the future but rather he demonstrates<br>various forms of capital taxation<br>already exist in most countries<br>especially in North America and Europe<br>and these could obviously serve as<br>starting points he adds that the capital<br>controls that exists in China and in<br>other emerging countries also hold<br>useful lessons for all<br>again stresses that the obstacles are<br>not technical<br>even if they might be presented as such<br>thus he argues that the technical<br>solution is Within Reach<br>on the gritty details of implementation<br>for instance he writes the capital tax<br>would work in the same way as income tax<br>currently does in many countries where<br>data on income are provided to the tax<br>authorities by employers<br>picketty often evokes the historical<br>example of Taxation in the United States<br>and he stresses that for many years<br>taxes in the United States were<br>considerably higher than they were in<br>Europe<br>he identifies how these taxes were<br>articulated with ideas of Merit and how<br>for many years there was lower<br>inequality in the United States than<br>elsewhere and that this did not hinder<br>economic growth<br>further as other critics of austerity<br>critics of austerity such as picketty<br>point out this is not a matter of there<br>not being enough money<br>question of redistribution is about what<br>to do with what there is<br>the national wealth of Europe he<br>stresses has never been so high the<br>nations of Europe have never been so<br>rich<br>and um<br>in a short text called absolute<br>imminence<br>Giorgio agamban contrasts a line of<br>imminence from a line of transcendence<br>on the side of transcendence he<br>positions and whosoil on the side<br>of imminence Spinoza and Nietzsche these<br>two paths content Spinoza meets in<br>Heidegger and then diverge again<br>with levinus and derida on the side of<br>transcendence and Duluth and Foucault on<br>this kind of categorization clearly<br>raises as many questions as it answers<br>first of all in the way<br>in which it elides a missing third term<br>at the starting point of cut and Spinosa<br>who is of course Hegel the great reader<br>of both who subjected both content<br>Spinoza to imminent critique<br>one of the many reasons for the<br>importance of Hegel for radical<br>philosophy and radical politics today is<br>this refusal of this alternative<br>imminence or Transcendence<br>his position on this is well known or at<br>least should be well known against the<br>various Traditions that have turned<br>difference into separation Hegel insists<br>on the demonstrable reality of the unity<br>of opposites and he does this in a way<br>that equally resists undifferentiated<br>abstract flat holism<br>flat ontology it's it's talked about in<br>in contemporary circles this new form of<br>flat stenosism<br>among contemporary thinkers who seek to<br>think Transcendence and imminence<br>together<br>perhaps none is important nor is full of<br>contradictions as you<br>I will not seek here to pretend that bed<br>use attempt to deal with the problem of<br>imminence is complete or consistent<br>either in principle or in elaboration<br>Peter hallwood amongst others has<br>identified serious problems with bad use<br>position on imminence and in particular<br>has demonstrated the consequences of<br>this first conception of politics<br>I should stress the fractured character<br>of betu's thought on imminence and<br>equally the fact that at the same time<br>there are many resources in bed use<br>thought that can offer a remedy for<br>these problems I will show this shortly<br>I want to draw attention in particular<br>to bed use critique of Otherworldly<br>moralism which can solve pedu's<br>otherworldly moralism<br>my concern is not with the Integrity or<br>purity of the thought of bad you or<br>anyone else but rather<br>for what it can offer in terms of an<br>orientation toward capital in the 21st<br>century<br>the question of imminence occupies a<br>central place in bedu's most recent work<br>no doubt in response to critical<br>questions raised by and others<br>about the seemingly Transcendent<br>appearance of truths in as early and<br>above all his middle period<br>imminence takes center stage in his<br>forthcoming imminence of truths the book<br>which will be the third and final part<br>of the being an event series and has<br>been at the heart of his seminar since<br>at least<br>2012. we have a participant in the<br>seminar Series right in the front here<br>you can listen to the seminars on the uh<br>the their website of the economile<br>superior<br>this um nevertheless the question of<br>transcender transcendence from within<br>the situation which in his most recent<br>teaching he describes as imminent<br>exception has occupied baju throughout<br>his work this conception is crucial and<br>even if baju has himself been far from<br>consistent in thinking through this<br>relation of imminent exception then the<br>difficulties that his position<br>encounters are I believe instructive<br>at his best Petru maintains the internal<br>relation between situation and event the<br>classic formulation of this appears in<br>being an event where baju seeks to grasp<br>what needs to be thought of the nature<br>of being for there to be the possibility<br>of something genuinely new arising out<br>of an existing situation<br>on the conception Defender there there<br>is no pure event change always takes<br>place at the edge of the situation at<br>the undecidable border of a situation<br>this is a recurrent reminder in bad Jews<br>thinking when he challenges the<br>thematics of absolute commencement a<br>change cannot be an absolute change he<br>says in his more recent teaching this is<br>a very important point A change is<br>always a change somewhere it is a change<br>in a situation<br>in being an event bet you calls the<br>problem of seeing changes arising from<br>the purity of an outside he calls this<br>speculative leftism and importantly he<br>connects the problem of speculative<br>leftism as some of us used to call this<br>utopian socialism in the past<br>he importantly connects the problem of<br>speculative leftism with pure willing<br>willing for things to be different pure<br>desire that things would be different as<br>he writes<br>we can term speculative leftism he says<br>any thought of being which bases itself<br>upon the theme of an absolute<br>commencement speculative leftism<br>imagines that intervention authorizes<br>itself on the basis of itself alone<br>speculative left to some imagines that<br>intervention authorizes itself on the<br>basis of itself alone<br>that it breaks with the situation<br>without any other support than its own<br>negative will end quote<br>and so far as bed you himself refuses<br>the temptation of speculative leftism he<br>finds that real change comes not purely<br>from willing or demanding it but from an<br>encounter with the situation which is<br>not reducible to the situation<br>in this ongoing dialectic which has been<br>forcefully articulated by Bruno<br>bastilles<br>this is precisely a mode of thinking<br>that does not seek to distinguish being<br>on the one hand from event on the other<br>hand but rather to articulate them<br>together within one in the same plane<br>for being an event to coexist<br>this involves positing the existence of<br>elements taken not to exist and<br>furthermore involves calling into<br>question the presupposed stability and<br>consistence of a situation<br>it involves asserting the existence of<br>the inexistent and with this bed use<br>Central Axiom of the non-being of the<br>one<br>non-being of the one the one is not all<br>this apparently abstract metaphysical<br>Axiom is taken by betu as the grounds<br>for his refutation of metaphysics given<br>that recall metaphysics is defined by<br>baju as the commandeering of being by<br>the one<br>that you does not draw these ideas from<br>nothing<br>but rather he takes them from that void<br>of negativity which is hegel's logic<br>in the science of logic we find the<br>infamous equation of being and nothing<br>and with this the imminence of the other<br>to any determinate being<br>the equation of being in nothing the<br>imminence of the other to any<br>determinant being bet you is clear about<br>this lineage from Hegel to himself with<br>Hegel he says the negation of a thing is<br>imminent to that thing but at the same<br>time exceeds it transcends it they pass<br>the kernel of the dialectic he says<br>elsewhere is the status of the negation<br>of an operator which separates as it<br>includes<br>elsewhere discussing the core of the<br>dialectic he says in Hegel the negation<br>of a thing is imminent to this thing but<br>at the same time it goes beyond the<br>thing<br>this negation exists that negation<br>exists on the inside is precisely why<br>Hagel argues against an abstract<br>ought that would impose itself from the<br>outside he argues against simply willing<br>that things be different which ends up<br>positioning the possible in the other<br>worldly and putting everything on the<br>side of the subjective world<br>he rails against I quote that kind of<br>understanding which takes the dreams of<br>its abstractions for something true and<br>which insists pretentiously on the ought<br>which it likes to prescribe especially<br>in the sphere of politics is if the<br>world has been waiting for this to learn<br>how it ought to be but isn't<br>echoing the remarks from his from the<br>phenomenology which I sort of cited<br>above<br>in his lectures on logic he formula<br>formalizes it like this it is far easier<br>to say what ought to be than to say what<br>is<br>although Hagel will have nothing of the<br>idea of immediate knowledge of things<br>fear unmediated sense perception he<br>praises the great principle that he<br>finds an empiricism like empiricism<br>Hegel says philosophy 2 only knows what<br>is<br>it does not know what only ought to be<br>and thus is not there<br>through his work Hegel returns again and<br>again to this problem this generally<br>appears in his rejection of the moralism<br>of the ought that is opposed to the<br>actual<br>shall I complicate it<br>he adds another twist there's a further<br>twist in the science of logic we don't<br>need to go necessarily into detail on<br>this but he gives it a further twist in<br>the science of logic in which he<br>identifies the divided nature of the alt<br>there he writes what ought to be is and<br>at the same time is not if it were it<br>would not be what merely ought to be<br>this pure willing that things be<br>different is that's always caught in<br>what is called in psychoanalysis the<br>drive<br>as Hegel anticipates the theory of the<br>drive as he puts it the will in itself<br>requires that its purpose not to be<br>realized<br>and the phenomenology will end the<br>complications back to the simple part<br>and the phenomenology Hegel<br>characterizes the this ultimately moral<br>point of view that seeks Purity as a<br>standpoint from which to criticize this<br>world he characterizes this as the<br>unhappy Consciousness which he<br>Associates with the stoics<br>as he explains the principles of the<br>stoics in his lectures on the history of<br>philosophy<br>um I quote it's implication the the<br>print implication of the principle of<br>the stoics is not that the condition of<br>the world should be rational and just<br>but only that the subject should<br>maintain its inner Freedom hence<br>everything that takes place outside all<br>that is in the world every circumstance<br>of the sort takes on a merely negative<br>status as are the afron uh indifferent<br>which I relinquish so I I stand outside<br>that world which is perverse this<br>unhappy consciousness<br>returns Hegel shows and refined form in<br>the moral criticism of the impurity of<br>the world on the basis of the way that<br>it fails up to live how with live it<br>fails to live up to how it ought to be<br>such moral criticism which Hegel<br>Associates above all with the the<br>morality of Kant and Victor can be I<br>hope you can see this is widespread<br>today<br>it divides itself from the world for the<br>reason of the world's corruption thought<br>then remains on the side of a perfectly<br>moral Beautiful Soul well actuality and<br>worldliness appear only negatively<br>this moral Consciousness he writes in<br>the phenomenology lacks the force to<br>relinquish itself it lacks the force to<br>make itself into a thing and to suffer<br>the burden of being it lives with the<br>anxiety that it will stain the glory of<br>its inwardness by means of action and<br>existence thus to preserve the purity of<br>its heart it flees from contact with<br>actuality and it steadfastly preserves<br>itself in its obstinate powerlessness to<br>renounce its own self a self which has<br>been intensified to the final point of<br>abstraction it persists in its<br>powerlessness to give itself<br>substantiality that is to transform its<br>thought into being and to commit itself<br>to this absolute distinction thought and<br>being<br>this is precisely the position that baju<br>criticized in being an event as<br>speculative leftism and earlier in his<br>theory of the subject as the option of<br>resignation resulting from the fact that<br>on the base of the basis of the<br>conclusion that we are in a ruinous and<br>faultless Epoch one might take the<br>position of withdrawing from it<br>completely<br>this is an Ethics that is grounded in<br>either Praise of the situation or<br>resignation to it but it's rather what<br>baju calls an ethics of discordance<br>which recognizes that the situation is<br>not all but takes a negative or<br>nihilistic stance a position that<br>touches on anxiety which knows that it<br>touches upon the real only through what<br>he calls the inconsolable loss of the<br>Dead world<br>against this ethics of discordance their<br>due defends a Promethean ethics grounded<br>in confidence in an affirmation of the<br>concrete and actual possibilities that<br>exist within but are unencountered are<br>unaccounted for by the situation<br>if this is a politics of the impossible<br>then this is a politics that<br>demonstrates that the impossible is in<br>fact quite possible and that it is<br>already taking place<br>in this context it is crucial to grasp<br>the status of the there is which bad you<br>will assert regarding the status of<br>something taken to non-exist to not<br>exist<br>this there is of the Apparently absent<br>runs through all of Badu's work<br>something but something which is often<br>but not always schematized as the<br>inexistent<br>and Logics of Worlds this is the except<br>there are truths that threatens to<br>interrupt any world it is also clearly<br>the motif of bad use practical politics<br>that starts from the there is of present<br>living and working bodies<br>and for instance the fourth of his<br>analyzes of our circumstances the first<br>book on Sarkozy that you writes there<br>exists in our midst woman and men who<br>although they live and work here like<br>anyone else are considered all the same<br>again this there is in bad Jew does not<br>come out of thin air<br>and can politics be thought bet you<br>presents the there is as the ground of<br>Marx's politics<br>for Mark's bedroom rights The Point of<br>Departure is there is a revolutionary<br>workers movement<br>that is there is a subject that presents<br>as obstacle where it unbinds itself<br>it is a pure there is a real<br>it is with respect to this there is that<br>you says that Marx advances this or that<br>thesis<br>so in this book The can politics be<br>thought bed you divides Marx from Hegel<br>and then splits Hegel from within in<br>order that he might return arguing that<br>Hegel was an obligatory reference point<br>although he surely did not furnish<br>either the principle of the formulation<br>of the there is nor the rule of<br>political engagement<br>proposing a rereading of Hegel that you<br>Argus<br>the referent of marxism's acquisitions<br>Hegel theoretically must be dismembered<br>disarticulated re-established something<br>I've already done you probably since so<br>as to participate in his way in the<br>Contemporary designation of the there is<br>which is at its starting point because<br>brought back to the foundational<br>hypothesis<br>there is an ordered political capacity<br>breed is a bad Jew will be well aware<br>that this foundational hypothesis there<br>is an ordered political capacity to<br>non-domination will appear repeatedly<br>through his work later it is formulated<br>as the generic version of the Communist<br>hypothesis<br>that the logic of class the fundamental<br>subordination of Labor to a dominant<br>class the arrangement which has<br>persisted since Antiquity this is not<br>inevitable it can be overcome<br>this there is that is irreducible to<br>Hegel finds Echoes across the record of<br>the French Revolution<br>in the pamphlet of Emmanuel Cas of<br>January 1789 we read what is the Third<br>Estate everything what until now has it<br>been in the existing political order<br>nothing what does it want to be<br>something<br>it's absolutely no coincidence that<br>pikety cites this slogan the slogan of<br>the French Revolution<br>nor that Piketty draws attention to the<br>continuity between the slogan and occupy<br>in fact it says you can only understand<br>occupy with a context of that slogan<br>it is also no coincidence that their<br>slogan reappears in the first stanza of<br>the the international of the song The<br>International which is first written in<br>1871 we are nothing let us be all<br>nor is it a coincidence that this Motif<br>recurs throughout Badu's work<br>for example in logics of Worlds we learn<br>of the inexistent projected into<br>existence the inner parent that shines<br>within being he proposes another<br>formulation<br>I quote a body is composed of all the<br>elements of the site that subordinate<br>themselves with maximal intensity to<br>bet you is certainly right that these<br>Acquisitions do not come from Hegel<br>alone<br>in the introduction to his critique of<br>hegel's philosophy of right of 1843-44<br>Marx explicitly introduces this Motif<br>from the French Revolution<br>and occupy and the international<br>as a Counterpoint that rubs up against<br>Hegel and moreover against the situation<br>of thought in Germany of the years<br>following the French Revolution<br>Marx therefore paraphrases Cas and<br>Praises him as that genius which can<br>raise material Force to the level of<br>political power the Revolutionary<br>boldness he says which flings into the<br>face of its adversary the defiant words<br>I'm nothing I shall be everything<br>this demand for the right to exist of<br>what already exists is of course not<br>foreign title to a certain angle to a<br>dismembered Heigl and remain Central to<br>Marx throughout<br>in his youth then Marx wrote We do not<br>anticipate the world without dogmas<br>but instead attempt to discover the new<br>world through the critique of the old<br>hitherto philosophers have left the keys<br>to all riddles lying in their desks and<br>the stupid uninitiated world had only to<br>wait around for The Roasted pigeons of<br>absolute science to fly into its open<br>mouths<br>from this polemical starting point in<br>his training in Hegel Marx commences to<br>undertake an imminent critique of<br>capital that runs across the three<br>volumes of capital the voluminous notes<br>of the gruntu and the extensive<br>commentary on the political economists<br>of his day that occupies the theories of<br>surplus value<br>it is the fact of a there is<br>that he uses to disconfirm the<br>pleasantries of Elites that finds the<br>manifesto open with the reality that<br>European uh Powers already recognize<br>communism as a power in its own right<br>in the inaugural dress of eight of 1864<br>he starts out from the great fact of the<br>misery of the working classes<br>in 1871 the year after the year of the<br>commune he writes the great social<br>measure of the commune was its own<br>working existence<br>the existence of the commune was the<br>fact<br>it's against<br>it was against abstract moralized<br>moralistic dreaming that Hagel wrote in<br>the philosophy of right what is rational<br>as actual and what is actual is rational<br>Domenico lasordo notes in his Feinberg<br>and Hegel that in his scathing critique<br>of hegel's philosophy of right Marx does<br>not even mention this phrase<br>and lasordo stresses that the claim of<br>the rationality of the actual is by no<br>means outside traditional revolutionary<br>thought<br>this lasordo's important argument that<br>the assertion of the rationality of the<br>actual is not a rejection of change but<br>its anchor in the objective dialectic of<br>the actual<br>it is probably useful for us to recall<br>that in the final version of the<br>encyclopedia logic of 1830. Hagel<br>returns to this phrase the ration was<br>actual actual as the rational and adds<br>by way of explanation<br>who would not have enough good sense to<br>see much around him which is indeed not<br>as it should be<br>he concludes philosophical science deals<br>solely with the idea which is not so<br>impotent that it merely ought to be<br>actual<br>I take hegel's remarks<br>to be equally relevant to the question<br>of how to read piketty's capital in the<br>21st century<br>as they are to the broader question of<br>how to read capital in the 21st century<br>indeed the two matters which I've so far<br>presented in turn or at least seem to<br>present in turn are not so distinct as<br>they may seem<br>if we are today here in search of a<br>political subject and if as bad you says<br>a subject is both a principle of<br>differentiation<br>the level of the individual the<br>determinate individual and globally a<br>principle of orientation towards a truth<br>procedure<br>and these questions of orientation<br>towards works of Economics such as<br>picketes<br>and towards current structures of<br>capital and state are pressing questions<br>for radical philosophy and for social<br>movements<br>this may be obvious to some of you if it<br>this work performs many of the moments<br>of a dialectical overcoming from within<br>that as we've seen again<br>an indispensable part of the radical<br>tradition<br>that piketty's project could belong to<br>the radical tradition while it's key at<br>its key moments departs from it or even<br>explicitly disowns it strategically<br>need to be taken as symptoms of an<br>opening<br>Piketty opens a series of doors even if<br>he himself doesn't go through all of<br>them at times for the reason of evoking<br>traditional traditionalistic even lines<br>of separation<br>this for instance in the final note to<br>the capital in the 21st century we read<br>the following<br>when one reads philosophers he says such<br>as Jean-Paul Sartre Louis Elton and our<br>Lampard you<br>on their Marxist and or communist<br>commitments one sometimes has the<br>impression that questions of capital and<br>class inequality are of only modest<br>interest to them and served mainly as a<br>pretext for just of a different nature<br>entirely<br>this comment by picketing should be read<br>very carefully as an important critical<br>moment for radical philosophers and for<br>activists in terms of their connections<br>with the already existing it is<br>certainly the case that baju drifts into<br>the abstract distance when he writes for<br>instance<br>I quote true critique of the world today<br>bet you says cannot boil down to the<br>academic critique of the capitalist<br>economy nothing is easier it says more<br>abstract and useless than the critique<br>of capitalism itself<br>those who make a loud noise in this<br>critique always led to wise reforms of<br>capitalism they propose a regulated and<br>comfortable capitalism and<br>non-pornographic capitalism and<br>ecological and always more democratic<br>capitalism they demand a capitalism more<br>comfortable for all and some they just<br>says capitalism with a human face<br>end quote so in bed you concludes that<br>the only dangerous and radical critique<br>is the political critique of democracy<br>he has exited the orbit of anything that<br>can reasonably be called materialism<br>this I believe is a terrible shame<br>because philosophers such as beds you<br>have a great deal to offer in<br>elaborating and extending the work of<br>economists such as picketing piketti<br>himself admits that much of the battle<br>ahead is not technical but as<br>ideological and in this life there is a<br>crucial importance in bad news<br>insistence on struggles in the realm of<br>thought and above all against all the<br>currents of today bad use insistence<br>that one can have and one can live for<br>against the placeholders pikety and bad<br>Jew<br>and moreover against their separation<br>I've been trying to draw out a common<br>relation to the overcoming of capital as<br>the problem for radical philosophy and<br>social movements in the 20th century<br>the overcoming of capital in the 21st<br>century this is our thing in itself<br>recall the principle that Hegel stresses<br>from the beginning to the end of the<br>science of logic the value of the first<br>demand on thought<br>this is what Plato demanded of cognition<br>he says that it should consider things<br>in and for themselves he writes this is<br>a demand that it should not stray away<br>from them while it grasps at<br>circumstances examples and comparisons<br>but on the contrary should keep only<br>them in view before it and bring to<br>Consciousness what is imminent in them<br>such a position<br>afraid neither of the labor of<br>Statistics nor the labor of the concept<br>takes bodies where they are rather than<br>where they merely ought to be<br>to read capital in the 21st century<br>means to see those bodies that exist<br>where they are supposed to not exist and<br>the capacities of those who are supposed<br>to not be capable<br>of course there is always a policing<br>operation which chases bodies back into<br>their places this is an operation to<br>which Rancier gives the classic formula<br>move along there's nothing to see here<br>in the tradition in our tradition and<br>regarding the reception of large books<br>we might recall the very concern on the<br>part of Marx and Ingalls on the<br>publication of volume one of capital in<br>1867 which was not so much the book<br>would be subject to criticism and<br>elaboration but rather that it would be<br>variously received with idle chatter and<br>silence<br>this is the policing operation that<br>always seeks to put radical thought and<br>that which is radical in thought back in<br>its place<br>I'm stressing here that Capital always<br>faces bodies that are not in the places<br>where they ought to be<br>and that Thomas picketty's is one of<br>these bodies<br>good thing about negativity is that it<br>is not something that needs to be<br>introduced to the situation from the<br>outside<br>our situation our situation like every<br>other one is marked by radical<br>negativity<br>Badu's point is that the inexistent<br>exists<br>that which is not is those who are<br>nothing are something<br>do this I'm stressing with Rancier that<br>people are already doing what they're<br>not supposed to do and that<br>depolitization and capture are always<br>secondary to mobilization manifestation<br>to register these mobilizations and to<br>show them in their logic certainly<br>exercises us today<br>this involves an Attunement of one's<br>senses and the senses of others which<br>does not see only the story of<br>domination but rather it's<br>incompleteness the things that are<br>breaking through<br>if one looks beyond this island indeed<br>if one looks within it one faces a<br>seething sea negativity need not be<br>introduced from the outside by for<br>instance a critical or a moral<br>conscience<br>rather<br>present efforts at pacification need to<br>be confronted directly<br>these include all the efforts that would<br>Corral disruption so that it runs in<br>separate channels that never connect<br>with one another<br>for the scholar and the activist this is<br>the lesson of what it means to orient<br>oneself to the other<br>a difference which does not separate<br>singularity in the unity of opposites<br>the other does not need to be invented<br>or created but is right here in our<br>midst<br>Beyond denial is a registering of the<br>other that is

abstract but in<br>the concrete<br>to read capital in the 21st century then<br>requires that one read pikety and a few<br>others<br>because one will find that capital is<br>not what it is often taken to be<br>the capital is not all<br>the one is not<br>that is Riven through with that which is<br>other to it is again not something we<br>need to say from the outside<br>the alarm bells are ringing in

minor<br>reforms but I sort of open possibly that<br>maybe also exist among people in radical<br>reforms as well<br>um<br>so the question there for me is sort of<br>what is at risk and that way of thinking<br>about what comes after meaning that is<br>is<br>that were not persuasive in social<br>movements instead of were stuck in that<br>way we're not drawing people in the<br>social movements that were unsuccessful<br>because of that that perhaps also we<br>were prone to burnout<br>because of the way in which we're<br>distancing ourselves not engaging and<br>perhaps also might lead into<br>not being able to engage with other<br>people within the social movement<br>um<br>maybe my thoughts here is just opening<br>up so the other the other possibility<br>what one of the other possibilities<br>because that sense of hopelessness is<br>understandable you know that response to<br>uh you know you take it back I mean<br>climate change is a an area we've done<br>worked on and that sort of thing yeah<br>that sense of hopelessness is a real<br>um it's a real risk and how we engage<br>with that<br>and that maybe<br>as actors or people involved in movement<br>statue to somehow<br>that hopelessness can coexist with a<br>form of Act of Hope and that's not<br>perhaps opposites and that that maybe<br>despair to have a place then so moving<br>forward I don't know how does that<br>interact with what we've been speaking<br>about yeah yeah I mean I suppose and um<br>yeah I I am kind of in a way implicitly<br>I'm saying that um you know if we<br>weren't involved if we want to be<br>involved in radical change we need to<br>think about these basic ontological<br>questions about what changes and that's<br>why badge you is important right and<br>contemporary thought contemporary<br>radical thought because it reminds us of<br>that kind of thing I suppose on a<br>marketing in the simplest way is to say<br>um it's not that the world is bad<br>the world is conflicted right and so if<br>we just cast the world as bad then we<br>will forever complain about it<br>and we won't see and that's the data we<br>won't see what's already happening there<br>which is which is exciting radically<br>possible right and that's the<br>psychological element of what I'm<br>drawing to drawing and trying to draw<br>attention to with that stoic idea of the<br>unhappy Consciousness the beautiful soul<br>and yes I do think it characterizes<br>um a number of movements social<br>movements and folk on the left right and<br>of course with that there are dangers<br>Beyond just the psychological things and<br>I want to say it's satisfying right<br>there's something really satisfying<br>about knowing that you're good and the<br>world is bad that's the psychological<br>thing that's important in what Hagel<br>shows us right it's really satisfying<br>because then you'll never get to it<br>where the world is out there right<br>politics is failure right and if you've<br>ever tried to do anything effectively<br>you'll know if you fail all the time you<br>get you get smashed up and there'll<br>usually be a bunch of beautifully<br>untouched academic standards oh don't<br>you know that you could have done really<br>yeah who were never doing anything those<br>academics generally right<br>because they are the beautiful souls<br>they are yeah<br>and and they are there once I'm calling<br>and so far as we're in a university<br>space here I'm saying to those academics<br>you know that that get involved and for<br>those of you who are already getting<br>involved um involve the others and tell<br>them there is no space outside this you<br>know yeah and with climate change I<br>think demonstrates as well the climate<br>and capital demonstrates there's no<br>outside right you don't you don't sit<br>outside that yeah because of the<br>materiality of the environment and the<br>environment the physical environment the<br>ecology and the built environment that<br>is to say which is stratified according<br>to Capital it has access to the built<br>environment to the commons is stratified<br>by by class right<br>so there's no outside of that so um yeah<br>and that's the basis as well for for<br>being much more radically comfortable<br>than the left has been the other part of<br>it that I'm trying to emphasize and I<br>maybe wasn't explicit about it is have<br>an idea and have an idea about Capital<br>because if you don't have an idea about<br>Capital you'll end up seeing the kind of<br>things that Russell Norman said<br>yesterday<br>have an idea about Capital it is<br>it's<br>touche touche you're right<br>yes<br>um really quickly pick up something<br>general knows they said about<br>um hopelessness I don't think it's so<br>much a risk I actually think it's a very<br>effective strategy of the ruling class<br>hopelessness is a really good thing to<br>push out every month to the product area<br>because it means they're not going to<br>try and change anything<br>um going back to the 70s where there was<br>a really big Groundswell of radical<br>politics and quite a few crises the<br>Groundswell of vertical politics now<br>right now there is right now<br>there are many crises for them all in<br>class<br>and the proletarian were quite<br>politicized it was also stride<br>resistance a lot of stuff going on<br>um but it definitely turned the the<br>bourgeoisie was essentially a hand and<br>they had a huge regenerative<br>um capability which always seem to rebut<br>the proletari in their in their<br>struggles that was 40 years ago and I<br>guess what I'd like to ask you is has<br>that regenerative ability improved is it<br>time to sleep back<br>practically how how can you tackle that<br>in my position on this is I wouldn't say<br>it's just a matter of 40 years ago I<br>would say there is always a resistance<br>to Capital and that always comes first<br>first comes the resistance to Capital<br>and incomes capital capital is<br>um is is something an apparatus to<br>capture it is a negative power that<br>seeks to catch things that are out there<br>amongst the creativity of of human being<br>right it channels and Corrals and then<br>seeks to attach to itself the things<br>that are done by other people that's<br>what wealth does that's what capital<br>does right so that's not new that's part<br>of the history of the struggle against<br>capital and you could say that there's<br>been a you could say that there's been a<br>failure over recent over recent years<br>you could say there's been a weakening<br>right but there's also been at the same<br>time a globalization of our struggle our<br>struggle today is for a global amongst<br>other things a global tax on Capital<br>Global right now globalization of our<br>struggle following the globalization of<br>of production and globalization of<br>capital with it is a possibility as much<br>as it is the failure of national<br>state-based politics right so we always<br>if you're on a progressive movement<br>you've not got the last thing we need to<br>do is sit around and talk tell us don't<br>tell us we have told the story about how<br>bad neoliberalism is and how it does all<br>these bad things and we are all done for<br>by this great big thing called<br>neoliberalism that keeps academics happy<br>in publishing stupid articles<br>there is no of no benefit we must<br>identify the actually existing<br>possibilities that are actually emerging<br>out of the prison situation including<br>the present situation of Finance Capital<br>Finance socializes us for example<br>phonics creates new modes of connection<br>between bodies radically new modes of<br>connection between people right we are<br>much more intimately connected now with<br>people all over the world in all kinds<br>of other situations mediated through the<br>physical devices that we touch and we<br>use through their work and our work we<br>are much more connected much more<br>socialized and the project is to channel<br>that socialization into positive new<br>ways to name it to say that<br>socialization which already exists<br>exists that's the ontological claim<br>which is to say we exist and if others<br>can't say it or say it and are<br>constantly told right and that's what<br>that's what the situation of domination<br>involves being dominated and saying I<br>hear who I'm lying under this way am<br>dominated I exist<br>and you're constantly told no you don't<br>exist no you don't exist or exist<br>marginally or you're not given the full<br>right to existence<br>so<br>it's always that's that's always the<br>struggle against<br>Andrew Jonathan and uh<br>yes Andrew maybe just a quick point of<br>theory Campbell um to bring it back to<br>Theory um because I'm a junkie<br>um you mentioned quietly the drive<br>um in relation and I'm wondering if<br>maybe picking up on the exact<br>uh point you just made in relation to<br>existence and the relationship to the<br>drives and the movements on the left<br>where do you see drivers working for or<br>against that<br>yeah okay so in psychoanalysis drivers<br>this repetitive satisfying repetition is<br>something that's kind of pathological<br>kind of not quite right right<br>um<br>I know I picked my fingernails but<br>it's nice so don't tell me to stop<br>picking my fingernail that's not going<br>to kill me right that's not the problem<br>it's nice yeah and yeah I think I think<br>that satisfaction of being caught in the<br>drive is is the dangerous and<br>pathological thing because there's<br>something about not finishing it one<br>doesn't want to finish it<br>and um that's what's staying in just the<br>telling what ought to be<br>so accent exit the drive<br>and it's not a theory that's just<br>political answer though<br>but I mean the theory in the blue clouds<br>are the same and all I mean the ability<br>to move takes at the drive is is the<br>exact ontological question the question<br>of the subject how do we exit the driver<br>and the first thing is to recognize that<br>one's enjoying it right yeah and uh then<br>and then you can I mean at a little<br>psychological kind of cure level kind of<br>in psychoanalysis like once I realized<br>that the reason I keep doing this<br>destructive thing is because I kind of<br>enjoy hurting myself there's a<br>compulsion to repeat in which I am<br>enjoying that pain then uh once knowing<br>that is at least the possibility for it<br>and the left should stop hurting itself<br>yeah<br>I'm satisfied and I mean that involves<br>doing practical steps though it's doing<br>some other kind of stuff right you know<br>joining forces with other things that<br>are already happening and what I'm<br>trying to say there is already this<br>other stuff that's happening okay don't<br>don't feel that the world out there is<br>just hostile join it join the bits of it<br>you know it means fracturing it breaking<br>it it is not all<br>you know it's not a one<br>but it's not just bad<br>this was beautiful I'm not just talking<br>yes I'm sorry<br>all right<br>yeah yeah okay we didn't even discuss we<br>um<br>so it strikes me this you know you<br>approach this Christian which I think is<br>a political question which is<br>you know picketting has a program in a<br>politics of uh you know Global wealth<br>taxes real life Texas this kind of thing<br>um and sort of distinguish it from<br>bedroom<br>in relation to this question boys it<br>seems like you you sort of pose it in<br>the relation to produce critique of<br>democracy yep so that I guess that's one<br>point maybe that I'm interested on if<br>I mean you know another thing that their<br>Jew has been producing massively<br>growth fabulous for the past you know<br>about 10 years is the question of<br>democracy and this strikes me that the<br>even Beyond you know quickly as useful<br>from here there's a different conception<br>of democracy which then LED you which is<br>where the political programmatic<br>difference between bad news politics and<br>Pekingese politics<br>I think lies so say in veggies book The<br>Remo of the history which would probably<br>his most uh clear programmatic political<br>work of recent times<br>you know his political program is is<br>based around local rights<br>which is<br>like outbursts of<br>say political movement social movements<br>which are not parliamentary or electoral<br>um and which had their own internal<br>logic and and it has Pro and then talks<br>about popular dictatorship<br>um yeah and so he has this program which<br>is<br>which is not uh<br>which is not the same as uh what it<br>seems what what it seems to be goodies<br>done with the Global Taxes okay um and<br>it seems like at that point it's like<br>there are two competing visions and<br>there's you know what their Duke was<br>communism whether or not you would put<br>Piketty into into the discourse of<br>communism I guess it's an interesting<br>question<br>um<br>but that it seems in the end that<br>packages Vision perhaps<br>is you know like like Sue said in terms<br>of Russell Norman Hercules vision is one<br>in which capitalism is maintained you<br>know that capitalist social relations<br>are maintained but they're heavily terms<br>which is not<br>the same yeah<br>I'll come back to the pickity thing in<br>terms of where the capital is maintained<br>for for picketing I'll come back to that<br>in a minute and I know where it's kind<br>of it's kind of simple because of how it<br>conceives of capital<br>um on page you though I'll be a little<br>more direct and a bit more blunt um<br>insofar as bed you disavows state<br>politics and disavows democracy he<br>flirts with if not<br>entertains uh the worst form of<br>speculative leftists<br>insofar as bad shoe disdain State<br>politics and politics and democracy he<br>entertains speculative lifters in the<br>worst form and I think that um Peter<br>horwood is absolutely right in his<br>critique of add you to that extent in<br>which they'd use politics becomes<br>utterly abstract moreover I would stress<br>this what he does which is dangerous<br>what it what he needs to rethink is his<br>separation of politics of the state from<br>politics of Civil Society it is the<br>separation of state and civil society<br>that is the target of Marx's critique<br>point the max makes is that you only<br>need it's only the state as separate<br>from civil society that needs to wither<br>away the withering away of the state is<br>its separation from Civil Society it's<br>not the state is such and what do we do<br>without governance right and I think<br>that you often entertain uh you know<br>it's just the riots and so forth right<br>and I think in doing so they do has a<br>very flat a very 19th century idea of<br>what the state is all right and I think<br>that we need to learn from what in the<br>20th century States actually did not<br>have a homogeneous idea of what the<br>state is recognize that a number of<br>things were done in the 20th century<br>with the state and in the 21st century a<br>number of things can be done with a<br>global state that are immensely<br>Progressive immensely Progressive<br>remember as well in the 1870s Marx was<br>very clear<br>reduction in the length of the Working<br>Day<br>these are measures that we these are not<br>the end of capitalism but we want them<br>and we want them now Max was clear about<br>that through the 1870s practical demands<br>of course the end of capitalism is the<br>goal but let's not dream of it as such a<br>radical outside that will never get<br>there and that's the problem is at the<br>heart of the problem the bed you thought<br>and that manifests itself more so in a<br>generation of young radical Scholars who<br>are brought up on baju who consider<br>every engagement with the state to be a<br>matter of dirtying their hands<br>and I say don't have unhappy<br>Consciousness and mess around on the<br>internet talking about how bad the state<br>is get involved now that's my kind of<br>point on that Ricardo where the<br>capitalism will end<br>um<br>pickety defines Capital as wealth<br>now we could complain about that right<br>and there are a number of problems right<br>and this is a debate that we'll have to<br>take place because he defines Capital<br>just as wealth right now on I want to<br>kind of give her both sides to it right<br>in some ways it's really important and<br>Progressive because it identifies forms<br>of wealth that are outside the purview<br>of the traditional Marxist particular<br>political economy<br>and so what's called for example in<br>recent um<br>what's called in in recent Marxist<br>political economy they're becoming rent<br>of profit the tendency for<br>um for new forms of rent seeking to<br>emerge alongside Capital this Dynamic is<br>quite nicely included within what uh<br>Piketty describes as capital as a wealth<br>capital is something including wealth<br>because he points out that a financial<br>industrial Capital tend to become<br>grounded in something that will then<br>claim a rent<br>tends to be invested in land with a<br>lower rate of return but a more secure<br>rate of return because then that can<br>will continue forever and even a low<br>rate of return over a long number of<br>years will multiply enormously okay and<br>then also give other things all of the<br>other things he talks about like NASA<br>inheritances which have become the basis<br>of transmission of wealth today<br>inheritance and gifting from one<br>generation to another right which is<br>part of the exclusion of the youth from<br>from from livelihood from the common<br>right so he does he does that and that's<br>in some ways a problem but in some ways<br>really importantly Progressive because<br>it expands what the critique of wealth<br>is about so he does speak of the<br>transcending of capitalism<br>capitalism very clearly and that is the<br>language of Alf habong in the classic<br>sense that Hegel uses the Hagler marks<br>speak exactly of a transcending and<br>doing away with<br>but transcending in that sense right<br>alphabel de per small is not uh um kind<br>of just just forgetting about it I don't<br>I don't think we should forget about all<br>of the great things that capitalism has<br>brought<br>it's not to say we shouldn't do aware of<br>capitalism but transcend yeah and uh<br>let's not be speculative leftists<br>let's move towards concrete measures of<br>veggies wrong and veggies right<br>all right probably one final question<br>and then uh let's keep the questions for<br>coffee break so that you can catch<br>just for transient migrant labor across<br>Europe okay<br>and I'm just pursuing this line of<br>thinking around what is possible so<br>you quoted by you saying that capitalism<br>always puts bodies where they open to be<br>you might want to restate that saying<br>that capitalism<br>unerring genius for Gathering up the<br>bodies that it needs and putting them<br>where they're required to fuel<br>calculus production so this this piece<br>of research that I looked at was<br>illegal undocumented labor arriving in<br>Britain<br>okay from all across the margins of<br>Europe whether Albania Macedonia<br>Ukraine uh<br>showing up early at dawn every morning<br>waiting to be called<br>some whatever work that might be<br>available and then transported to<br>factory farms that working punishing us<br>always at risk for injury and no one is<br>held accountable<br>that seems to be the reality of growing<br>numbers of people who are fueling<br>production in Europe<br>how do you think about what is possible<br>there<br>because these people are you imagine<br>you're fleeing something even more<br>unendurable<br>come and endure what they're enduring<br>so what does it mean to ask what is<br>possible yeah and I mean this is not<br>just this is not just Europe This is the<br>um this is the construction workers who<br>are building Singapore this is the<br>people who are fishing the oceans of<br>this country I mean this is the reality<br>of I am and I just add to that that in a<br>way you could say this has always been<br>the case whether you thought of slaves<br>in ancient times and slaves and<br>indentured laborers in colonial times<br>these are the modern day Expendable<br>bodies yep and this is where I I think<br>that they use assertions of practical<br>politics that<br>um in his premised on his motto for this<br>um there's only one world<br>there's only one world we we all who<br>live and work and exist in this world<br>who are in this world we are and equally<br>have a right to exist and what capital<br>does is it creates<br>um separations barriers divisions and um<br>yeah I mean um you've got hypocritical<br>Scoundrels uh like Mike Moore write<br>books about how Global in this country<br>wrote books about how globalization<br>makes one world right it makes yes it<br>makes one world but one world in which<br>there are two worlds in it right and um<br>the<br>the interesting thing for me about bet<br>years work is that he he proposes one<br>world<br>but it's one world in which which is<br>premised on multiplicity right so it's<br>premised on the beginning point of that<br>is multiplicity<br>um equally it's what Hague will call<br>Singularity right so the fact of many<br>particularities existing within it's a<br>it's a universal which includes<br>particularities in it right I think it's<br>got to be the starting point<br>um otherwise we get on the um in an<br>academic terms we get in this kind of<br>let's look at all particularities<br>because the world's so complex and we<br>must not universalize and so forth right<br>yeah that was called post-modernism and<br>post-structuralism and social<br>construction all that right we're done<br>with that that is done that is not<br>useful that is a a project of repeating<br>the Dynamics of multiplication that is<br>capital right<br>um veggies veggies proposal there is one<br>world is a way of exactly challenging<br>that of saying those people who are<br>there who have only a minimal right to<br>exist also exist and deserve equally the<br>right to existence as everyone else yeah<br>and I think there's a practical politics<br>in that that's really important for the<br>left it's ontological but it's also<br>quite directly political as well<br>or to put it differently the ontological<br>the philosophical is not separate from<br>the political they've returned to each<br>other so that they can inform each other<br>right and then there's no more abstract<br>philosophy done down that end and<br>practical politics done here or an<br>outside that moving between and across<br>borders is absolutely crucial and in<br>terms of into the argument in terms of<br>intellectual I've not gone to the whole<br>thing here<br>um but I've done this again and again in<br>other places that movement<br>intellectually between different spaces<br>is absolutely quite crucial right within<br>the university is<br>um is cut up by people who want to not<br>have to listen to other people<br>right and that remember<br>the division of labor in the university<br>is premised on<br>Emanuel kant's appropriation of Adam<br>Smith's idea of the division of labor is<br>very very clear about it right the<br>foundation of the modern German<br>University is premised on the idea of<br>mass production the division of labor<br>right it was a principle that Kant takes<br>from Adam Smith directly right read the<br>groundwork of the metaphysics tomorrow<br>is the second preface to the<br>contribution of the critique of<br>um to critique of pure reason he's very<br>clear division is a good thing for<br>right and hegel's point is well the<br>things that are divided<br>are implicated in each other even when<br>divided<br>so those people who are doing the<br>fishing are implicated in our dinner<br>tonight<br>so they should exist<br>all right thank you very much for this</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
