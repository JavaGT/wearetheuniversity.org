100% accurate.</p><p>right well I think thank you Thank You<br>bezel so it's a pleasure to be here this<br>what we'd like to do this evening is<br>actually to talk about the results of<br>the the work that we've been doing over<br>the last year and a half and oh what<br>I'll do is I'll run through there some<br>of the contextual stuff and Steven will<br>talk more about the the modeling results<br>and what they're actually beginning to<br>tell us and I use the word beginning<br>deliberately because you know we don't<br>see having gone to the report that this<br>is certain now it's on people shelves<br>that you want them actually to be useful<br>on an ongoing basis so we want them<br>actually just to be the start of the<br>conversation about delivering a more<br>resilient energy future and in New<br>Zealand and so more specifically this is<br>what we'll talk to you about this<br>evening HD but before we do we'd like to<br>play a video that hopefully neatly<br>encapsulates what we've been trying to<br>do well hopefully you'll agree that<br>their kind of captures captures a good<br>overview of our project in fact a you're<br>the first public audience to see that we<br>tried to play this at the launch a note<br>it was a meltdown so so so just before I<br>get into some of the detail I'd like to<br>briefly introduce you actually to the<br>business new zealand energy council for<br>those of you who haven't heard of it<br>first and foremost each year it sir<br>that's a part of New Zealand's largest<br>business advocacy body business New<br>Zealand we established the big at the<br>beginning of 2013 its members come from<br>right across the energy sector and<br>importantly from government academia and<br>business and you'll see in fact you<br>would have seen from some of their logos<br>on the end of that film that that mix<br>was more than present on the development<br>of our our scenarios end<br>importantly added strength and<br>robustness to the work to the work that<br>we did actually I'm interested who's<br>heard of the put up your hands if you've<br>heard of the world energy council ok<br>well let's actually more than I more<br>than I thought and because generally<br>when you when you talk to audiences<br>people think about the IAEA as the<br>natural default but the world energy<br>council is the principle and partial<br>network of leaders and practitioners<br>promoting the Affordable stable and<br>environmental sustainable energy system<br>for all I've been around since nineteen<br>twenty three they've got about a hunter<br>it's now up to about a hundred member<br>committees covering over 3,000 member<br>organizations and again that's across<br>that spectrum and a nutshell actually<br>there are a global energy thought leader<br>a much larger of course than the IAEA<br>where the bottom-up network that<br>actually allows for some when we call it<br>truth-telling and mythbusting and effect<br>they work on a characteristics that<br>attracted attracted us to become a part<br>of the world energy council so what got<br>us ecchi to the point of doing this<br>groundbreaking breaking bit of work well<br>it was essentially this equation I mean<br>it might seem a bit on first blush a bit<br>of an odd statement but let me explain<br>meaning in essence the global energy<br>system is increasingly in rapidly<br>becoming more and more complex there<br>used to be just one price signal it used<br>to be the price of oil and but now we've<br>got multiple price signals regional gas<br>hubs the carbon price so low in battery<br>technology costs and so all of these<br>narrow influential and and Viet when<br>thinking about future investments in the<br>relativity's between those investments<br>and if you like fast food well actually<br>now we've got fast energy the the used<br>to be that the quickest period of time<br>to turn over a piece of energy<br>infrastructure was actually the car and<br>it was around ten years plus so there<br>actually wasn't very quick at all but<br>you know now we've got the impact of<br>shale shale oil and gas in the US the<br>collapsing solar and battery prices then<br>of course the rise of the the prosumer<br>so with glowing growing global<br>uncertainty plus fast energy actually so<br>good you were growing global complexity<br>plus fast energy you've got uncertainty<br>with basically we thought there was a<br>gap in the gap in the New Zealand energy<br>toolbox it would help decision makers<br>like you identify and manage that<br>uncertainty end complexity and of course<br>this isn't just a I mean it's very easy<br>to think it's kind of out there it's not<br>us well it's not just a global<br>discussion it's actually happening here<br>in New Zealand on almost a daily basis<br>you open the hero every morning you'll<br>be another energy-related headline and<br>so here are some er I mean all of those<br>will be fairly familiar i would imagine<br>with all of you so that just speaks to<br>the the drive to actually help<br>domestically with a with a piece of work<br>that will shed light on again that<br>complexity and uncertainty so what why<br>scenario as well as i said you know we<br>think that they were helpful we know<br>that the global and domestic energy<br>system is undergoing significant changes<br>and that the pace of changes i said is<br>increasing and a no small part of course<br>to consumers increasing propensity to<br>adopt new technology and so in this<br>situation actually we got to the point<br>where we thought in the absence of<br>useful information that will actually<br>again help decision makers like you<br>decision makers like you to make<br>informed decisions about what are those<br>trade-offs around factors like energy<br>security energy equities and a new<br>zealand's case an affordability question<br>and environmental sustainability and so<br>we kind of figured that the absence of<br>that information was palpable and we all<br>know of course that our ability to<br>predict beyond the next few years as<br>seriously challenged and traditional<br>forecasting or normative approaches<br>actually begin to lose relevance the<br>further you go out into the future and<br>so the other the other key benefit of<br>doing a scenarios work was the ability<br>to quantify them so what we've delivered<br>is hopefully it quite a data rich set of<br>scenarios you know what we think that<br>the data will do will actually help<br>reveal where they make more transparent<br>where those trade-offs are what some of<br>the choices the trade-offs on their<br>impacts are on it and a real in a real<br>way and of course you know while we're<br>talking at the 2050 the whole idea of<br>looking out to the future is that it<br>will help us make better decisions about<br>the future today in the last point here<br>we talk about resilience and it was one<br>of those strong themes that came out<br>during the project just in terms of both<br>energy policy and investment decision<br>making you know what we wanted to do is<br>help build greater resilience under our<br>future decisions and of course<br>resilience itself as in an endpoint it's<br>an enduring test of what we do so I know<br>of course the question on everyone's<br>lips is you know did we have to start<br>this project from scratch well that's a<br>great question our relationship to the<br>world energy council actually gave us a<br>huge leg up in terms of getting this<br>thing off the ground because what we do<br>is draw off the work that the world<br>energy council did so what we'll do is<br>quickly fairly quickly run through the<br>the world energy council elements of us<br>introduce you to the the wick scenarios<br>and themselves as what they do is they<br>and four they formed a very important<br>backdrop to the work that we did in<br>essence what the week did was develop<br>two stories with the help of its member<br>Committees of which New Zealanders one<br>and in fact we had a new zealand ER who<br>cheered the scenarios study group in an<br>essence what we've got down here are the<br>three tests which they lived by an in<br>fact that we lived by the conceptual<br>approach was to develop scenarios<br>that meet those three tests were they<br>plausible with a distinct and were they<br>coherent now I can tell you that that's<br>a lot easier to say that than it is to<br>deliver them and practice and that's<br>actually part of the part of the<br>challenge and happy to say actually part<br>of why this project took us 16 17 odd<br>months to land the number of the num the<br>amount of anguishing in fact we had to<br>go over the storylines because each<br>storyline on buds and beads a certain<br>set of cultural economic and<br>environmental social institutions and so<br>if you started you know someone would<br>say we'll have that X and you're going<br>to think well does that drive your<br>stories closer or further apart and if<br>you change its what does it mean to a<br>and B within that storyline so it was<br>actually in fact without those three<br>tests i think we'd probably still be<br>arguing about our storyline so is<br>actually an incredibly strong discipline<br>so the idea of the week scenarios in so<br>our scenarios was to essentially to<br>portray a range of equally conceivable<br>outcomes I mean to aid the understanding<br>of her different factors can interact<br>and shape the future and so to identify<br>the robust waters and actually<br>critically again for our scenarios were<br>to develop scenarios that were neither<br>right nor wrong good nor bad that they<br>were intended and needed to be to be<br>robust to be a mix of all of those all<br>of those features and so here's a brief<br>outline of each of the two week scenario<br>stories or narratives now I won't go I<br>won't go through these you can read them<br>for yourself other than actually to say<br>the critical uncertainties that helped<br>form the week scenarios were based<br>around the role of markets and<br>governments and so there was a<br>decentralized versus orchestrated market<br>lead vs government lead since that plays<br>out across these storylines end I have<br>to say well this helped shape our<br>stories we certainly work<br>I'd with a wide range of stakeholders<br>here in New Zealand to define our own<br>critical uncertainties and how they<br>played out and the stories and actually<br>interesting look you know we all know<br>what scenarios are right well actually<br>our experiences you get 10 people in the<br>room you actually get 15 different views<br>about what about what scenarios are and<br>you know we've all seen a variety of<br>scenarios so we've got the transmission<br>grid scenarios we've got em be with<br>their when use another acronym I'm not<br>too sure what it stands for ages<br>electricity generation demand scenarios<br>we've got transport scenarios out the<br>2442 but the the uniqueness of our<br>scenarios is that there are cross the<br>entire energy sector and and dot<br>that must be the 80s I think end by<br>government rather than a business lead<br>initiative where those such scenarios<br>were well last well arse done and so<br>that was actually part of the<br>opportunity to actually help<br>reinvigorate a conversation around<br>business end back into policymakers<br>about the usefulness of scenarios well<br>actually what scenarios are in the their<br>usefulness and even said that the wit<br>scenarios provided context for our<br>scenarios you know the stories we've<br>told and the modeling inputs we have<br>used a most definitely New Zealand<br>orientated and Steven will talk more<br>about the modeling and puts in a couple<br>of minutes some think we wanted and in<br>fact we like the idea of to be able to<br>come up with their own unique stories<br>about New Zealand's energy future but<br>actually to be able to look at them<br>through a a wrist of the world chairs in<br>a risk of the world symphony lens out of<br>the wick scenarios end the framework<br>that that provided and actually<br>thankfully so did a whole bunch of other<br>organizations they saw the opportunity<br>as well and you look at that and that's<br>pretty much a who's who of organizations<br>with an interest and the energy the<br>energy sector you know there was a wide<br>range of others who also saw the<br>potential for the development of some<br>robust plausible scenarios and here here<br>they are<br>um so this speaks to the robustness I<br>think of what we've done it wasn't just<br>business New Zealand with with the help<br>of Stephen or other organized well<br>actually with the help of Steven it<br>wasn't just as we wind into a dark room<br>and popped out 15 months later a set of<br>airline stories these these<br>organizations were all active from the<br>get go right through the development of<br>the storylines the inputs we input<br>assumptions we we used and in fact how<br>we only are talking about themselves<br>pretty pretty comprehensive and pretty<br>robust and put they weren't silent<br>sponsors but active participants and<br>importantly we had strong Buy in from<br>government in on pleased too pleased to<br>see that in fact they're already using<br>kayak and Walker and their assumptions<br>and their briefings to government so<br>that's you know that's that's great from<br>our perspective and it's also actually<br>extremely hard to believe in fact it was<br>we've had an article when energy news<br>recently and one of those someone's put<br>a comment down the bottom saying that<br>we've got our head stuck somewhere that<br>I won't mention but it's actually quite<br>hard to believe that the Ministry<br>infecteds about coal buckets the<br>ministry for the environment in Meridian<br>would have their heads largely stuck in<br>their coal buckets it's just hard to<br>believe believe there you know when you<br>look at that that grew up there oh I<br>thank you John and thank you basil for<br>inviting us along again it's a pleasure<br>to be here and just moving back to that<br>previous slide because I will touch on<br>it briefly the sheer range and diversity<br>accompanies sitting around a single<br>table certainly presented some<br>challenges but it's also testimony I<br>think to John's vision and tenacity and<br>getting them on board I mean I don't<br>know whether any of you have tried to do<br>these multi-party multi-company things<br>but my goodness getting that range of<br>people government research organizations<br>and industry around the table also gave<br>us the odd headache but there was a<br>fantastic job pulling that together John<br>my role in the project was to support<br>John primarily just through managing the<br>project and principally the modeling<br>which I'll talk about in a minute the<br>first task we came across and the<br>project was to create the storylines<br>themselves and in order to do that we<br>were limited to two so you can imagine<br>all the different potential views even<br>in this room about what some scenarios<br>about the future we had to boil that<br>down to two to line up with weeks<br>modeling which was the jazz and symphony<br>so it's John indicated before the<br>context for these storylines where the<br>rest of the world is in the market lead<br>jazz and one scenario the rest of the<br>world is in them and the government<br>leads Symphony and the rest of the world<br>what would that then mean for New<br>Zealand of those two contexts global<br>context persisted and the way we did<br>this is we got together three workshops<br>principally with a much wider range of<br>people than just the logos on that<br>previous slide we had Salvation Army we<br>had the youth delegation gene zero a<br>range of the outside the energy industry<br>because we didn't want this to be<br>essentially an energy industry project<br>we were all we thought about was<br>kilowatt hours and Peter jewels and so<br>we did get a decent range of people in<br>that room and believe me that was an<br>absolute hoped you could imagine some of<br>the views that were being expressed<br>around the room quite vociferous ly<br>about how the world was going to play<br>under these different scenarios and at<br>the end of the day with thirty forty odd<br>people in each of these workshops that<br>we ran we boiled it down to John<br>mentioned critical uncertainties there<br>were 19 critical uncertainties for New<br>Zealand among which some of the key ones<br>was exactly what you articulated before<br>bezel which is things like global growth<br>geopolitical instability climate change<br>and disruptive technologies all featured<br>and the top part of those critical<br>uncertainties then we likened it to a<br>game of Twister how do you sort of<br>combine the different potential outcomes<br>of each of those uncertain certainties<br>into two plausible coherent and distinct<br>storylines I just like to acknowledge<br>one other person Aaron web from pwcs in<br>the room though Narron and PwC were huge<br>supporters of particularly this part of<br>the process and this was seriously<br>difficult so writing those storylines up<br>and to something that actually made<br>coherence since was an enormous task I<br>think you Aaron for doing that the two<br>names as John mentioned we came up with<br>kayak was our name for the scenario that<br>came out of the dynamic jazz world<br>Walker was the more orchestrated world<br>that we believe New Zealand and its own<br>way would move into when the rest of the<br>world was in symphony and hopefully it's<br>reasonably obvious why we chose those<br>two names the kayak that you're in it by<br>yourself and dynamically peddling where<br>you want to go woke up very much<br>everyone's pedaling in the same<br>direction if you don't want to go there<br>you better just hop off the boat no life<br>jackets the the quantification of a very<br>much summarized at a high level the<br>inputs here and the full document which<br>is up on the BIC website you can see all<br>the actual numbers that set next to<br>these but I'm just going to quickly talk<br>you through some of the inputs that win<br>in here now want you to bear in mind<br>that there were potentially any number<br>of combinations of these critical<br>uncertainties that we could have<br>introduced we were both aiming for<br>plausibility and coherence but also<br>distinction we wanted the two pars to<br>actually deviate the last thing we<br>wanted was the two things to kind of<br>collapse into the middle and have two<br>scenarios that basically see the same<br>thing so we reasoned under kayak<br>population would be higher under that<br>market lead scenario immigration would<br>be a lot higher<br>freer in terms of immigration wouldn't<br>be much changed the underlying native<br>population growth but immigration would<br>be the key differentiating factor<br>whereas under Walker you would have a<br>lot more stringent control and what's<br>happening around immigration to take the<br>pressure off resources in the country<br>GDP per capita higher and kayak the WIC<br>modeling for the rest of the world<br>suggested that Southeast Asia China<br>Australia were glowing a lot growing a<br>lot stronger their economies were<br>growing up stronger in the kite scenario<br>where as will come to in a minute but<br>principally because of the carbon<br>agreements those economies were growing<br>less strongly in the Walker scenario so<br>it made sense from an export perspective<br>that we would reflect those assumptions<br>and the GDP per capita so you can see<br>just those first two assumptions<br>immediately set you on a path of strong<br>growth and one and not so strong growth<br>and the other high population higher GDP<br>per capita and one and lower your<br>population isn't declining but you've<br>got lower growth and lower GDP per<br>capita and the other the third one up<br>there carbon agreements was another<br>critical differentiating factor so here<br>under the kayak scenario you don't get a<br>strong out come out of Paris you end up<br>with regionalised carbon approaches<br>fragmented across the globe different<br>economies taking different approaches to<br>carbon at the end of that cutting to the<br>chase you get carbon prices of about<br>kiwi 60 a ton by the time you get to<br>2050 that's in real terms now some<br>people look at that and go well I<br>wouldn't call that low still 60 bucks a<br>ton kiwi by 2050 but if you flip across<br>the Walker under that you have you have<br>a binding globally binding and strong<br>agreement come out of Paris and you end<br>up going on a passed and almost twice<br>that in terms of your carbon price by<br>the time you get to 2050 and just it<br>just to be clear yes for the modeling we<br>assumed it was a carbon price and the<br>story lines we said actually the price<br>could be achieved or the equivalent of<br>the price could be achieved in a number<br>of different ways you might just go for<br>quantity limits you might just go for<br>different frameworks but ultimately for<br>modeling you needed a price to go in<br>there and it's the key thing is roughly<br>twice as severe as what happens under<br>kite then resources very quickly those<br>electricity demand generation scenarios<br>where we got most of the inputs<br>for our electricity generation plant<br>lower cost of gas exploration and kayak<br>was the only way we could reflect what<br>we believe was an increased chance of<br>exploration and discovery under the<br>kayak scenario as opposed to Walker the<br>coal to liquids without CCS is a bit of<br>an odd one to throw up the you wouldn't<br>thought we would have to make an<br>assumption about with the carbon capture<br>and storage was bolted onto a CTL plant<br>but we did and I'll come to that later<br>on technology support and the kayak free<br>market world obviously no subsidies of<br>any kind in the kayak scenario but under<br>the Walker scenario we had three key<br>elements to our technology support there<br>was a subsidy of biofuels of twenty<br>percent there was a what we called a<br>facilitation of large hydro because we<br>reasoned in the Walker scenario and our<br>story line there was a government that<br>was doing its best to chase a hundred<br>percent renewables and therefore would<br>be more comfortable pushing through<br>large hydro projects under the RMA and<br>energy efficiency policies these were a<br>lot stronger under the Walker scenario<br>we had things like ban on coal boilers<br>been on incandescent light bulbs so any<br>reasonable practical thing that a<br>government could do to encourage energy<br>efficiency was implemented and worker<br>consumption behavior price based again<br>under kayak and people just responding<br>to price principally but under Walker<br>you had we had significantly reduced<br>like vehicle fleet use by about twenty<br>percent by the time you get to 2050 so<br>from roughly 12,000 vehicle kilometers<br>traveled per vehicle at the moment down<br>2 9800 for the light fleet so that's<br>actually quite significant and you'll<br>see those results come through shortly<br>as to what that means so that's a very<br>quick whistle stop tour through the<br>input assumptions there's oodles more in<br>the document if you want to scratch into<br>the actual numbers and see what's going<br>on key messages that come out of the<br>outputs which I'm just going to touch on<br>briefly now now John has pretty much<br>pretty much covered all these quite<br>comprehensively in terms of the messages<br>the mirror messages that kind of came<br>out of the scenario modeling project<br>what I want to get onto is some of the<br>key modeling outputs so firstly we start<br>the highest level with this full energy<br>system model and I should reiterate as a<br>full energy system model the modeling<br>was conducted by a group called the pull<br>Shira Institute and Switzerland are the<br>largest federally funded research center<br>and all of Switzerland and believe me<br>working with a German and Swiss modeler<br>at midnight yeah that was fun very<br>precise everything was very precise I'm<br>one of those not seven decimal places on<br>each of these numbers up on the chart<br>actually so the first thing that's based<br>on Markel model for those of you that<br>have been familiar with sort of energy<br>economy models that's based around<br>Markel highly deterministic perfect<br>foresight model but one that brings out<br>the key interconnections so energy<br>demand first thing here energy demand is<br>predicted in the Walker scenario to go<br>down now for a lot of people that raises<br>a few eyebrows the fact that the energy<br>do this is totally in gmail could go<br>down and it does under the Walker<br>scenario compete about twenty three<br>percent compared to going up fifteen or<br>eighteen percent and the kayak scenario<br>so you can see that the key<br>differentiating factor a point to hear<br>the key differentiating factor between<br>the two scenarios is really that blue<br>bar at the bottom which is oil okay and<br>we'll come to that in a couple of slides<br>when we talk about what happens in the<br>transport sector but largely everything<br>else grows to some extent main other<br>defeating factor this is today this bar<br>here sort of know what you'd call that<br>color is coal and interestingly in both<br>scenarios it reduces significantly but<br>more so and Walker so even the $60 a ton<br>carbon price is enough to seriously<br>diminish the country's consumption of<br>coal as a primary fuel but the key take<br>out of this is yeah that potential<br>declining energy consumption between now<br>and 2050 and the Walker scenario moving<br>to electricity within that effectively<br>you see again two different growth paths<br>but you do see growth in both the 2050<br>sorry the kayak<br>electricity demand everything about<br>demand this is a graph of supply but if<br>you think about the equivalent demand<br>it's roughly equivalent to one point two<br>percent compounding growth between now<br>and 2050 now for those who are familiar<br>with what's happened over the last 20 or<br>so years and electricity we've probably<br>seen on average somewhere between 1.4<br>and one-point-six percent growth in<br>electricity the last five or six years<br>have been a little bit different from<br>that but certainly over a longer time<br>period you're sitting at around one<br>point six percent so this is predicting<br>already in the high growth scenario a<br>lower compounding annual growth of<br>electricity demand than what we've<br>observed over the last couple of decades<br>but again it's it's not quite half that<br>but about two-thirds that rate under the<br>Walker scenario and that is largely<br>because of those energy efficiency<br>policies which you talked about before<br>as well as lower population growth in<br>GDP growth playing out and their key<br>difference between these two scenarios<br>will firstly under kayak you only get to<br>eighty-five percent renewables and your<br>electricity supply chain whereas you get<br>to ninety-eight percent and Walker now<br>John and I literally concluded the<br>modeling I think it was a day before<br>Huntley announced that it was shutting<br>down which was two days before odor who<br>announced it was shutting down and we<br>said there go I can't believe it were<br>just made two predictions and we're<br>already well on their way to well at<br>least was eighty percent last year but<br>potentially by 2020 you'll see a much<br>higher percentage of renewables which is<br>fantastic news I argue it's a perfect<br>demonstration of why scenarios are so<br>good because the number of land<br>somewhere in the middle so there you go<br>we had it right the ninety-eight percent<br>is of some significant interest to<br>people think well can you actually<br>feasibly get to ninety-eight percent<br>renewables in your electricity system<br>given the vagaries a hydro in particular<br>and the way the model is doing it in<br>this particular instance and you can see<br>it to some extent here this y-axis here<br>is generation per year rather than<br>capacity just to be clear and you'll<br>notice that a walker scenario you hurt<br>you only see a tiny sliver of gas plant<br>up here and that's one of the reasons<br>you're getting a ninety-eight percent<br>but<br>what's sitting behind that if I had a<br>graph of gas capacity that was available<br>it's substantially more than what that<br>line would have it's about eleven<br>hundred megawatts of gas plant that's<br>running at around ten percent load<br>factors now if you go and ask contact<br>and Genesis what load factors they like<br>their gas plant running on it's a lot<br>higher than TM Bhasin so you've actually<br>got a whole lot of kit here lying around<br>waiting for the lakes to go a bit dry<br>think about the commercial frameworks<br>you have to think about in order for<br>that to be realistic but that's how the<br>model was still satisfying 98% renewable<br>in an average hydro year in terms of<br>other key differences or factors of<br>scenario you can see that the growth is<br>principally coming from geothermal and<br>when they go up nearly threefold in both<br>scenarios hydro plays a bit of a<br>stronger role in Walker than kayak that<br>reflects that facilitation a large hydro<br>you see a bit more of the 250 300<br>megawatt hydro projects appearing and<br>Walker than you do in kayak infect the<br>zoning I think one or two hydro projects<br>transport now this is probably one of<br>the most fascinating results of the<br>scenarios that we had you're a member on<br>that first chart one of the big<br>differentiating factors between primary<br>energy consumption between two scenarios<br>was oil and you can see exactly what's<br>going on here so in the kayak scenario<br>here internal combustion engine vehicles<br>that this is just your traditional IC e<br>here doesn't grow much from today most<br>of the growth is met by this orange bar<br>here which is your liquid fueled hybrid<br>so this is your Priuses and your Camrys<br>and that kind of thing so you're not<br>plugging something into the grid you<br>just chuck in a battery and it to make<br>effectively make the internal combustion<br>engine more efficient so that's where<br>the growth principally comes from in the<br>kayak scenario however under the Walker<br>scenario you firstly you have slightly<br>fewer vehicles and that was a result of<br>one of our assumptions that in Walker<br>you're the urban design would be up not<br>out you'd probably have people owning<br>fewer cars and they'd be more likely to<br>pick up alternative modes of transport<br>so that drives the number of new cars<br>down to about 4.1 million versus about<br>4.8 million<br>and kayak but the real difference<br>between these two is what happens to the<br>internal combustion engine and Walker<br>the combination of battery costs the oil<br>price with the carbon uplift and the<br>electricity price sees a quite a<br>different vehicle fleet over in the waka<br>sonar in 2050 you've still got your<br>hybrids there your non plug-in hybrids<br>but around 2 million of your 4.1<br>vehicles on the road for a million<br>vehicles on the road derivatives of<br>electric cars either electric vehicles<br>or plug-in hybrids and you can see we<br>also get a lovely little purple hydrogen<br>option up the top the way I interpret<br>that is not that I necessarily believe<br>that this would be the shares that you<br>would see and transfer at that point but<br>it's an indicator that actually any of<br>these options could potentially come to<br>fruition originally when we ran our<br>first round of modeling we allowed it to<br>pick CNG as an option there and sure<br>enough in the Walker scenario you had<br>CNG cars you had idling cars yet<br>electric cars the internal combustion<br>had everything under the Sun and we SAT<br>around as a project team and said with<br>New Zealand seriously fund and build the<br>infrastructure to support the<br>distribution of hydrogen as a fuel gases<br>of fuel electricity as a fuel petrol and<br>diesel as a fuel as well as build our<br>public transport probably not so we<br>limited one of those options it's<br>largely I'll blame it on Z energy you<br>said we're going around ripping out the<br>cng tanks from all the picture of<br>stations at the moment and we limited it<br>to these but the point is which of the<br>electric or hydrogen thing eventuates is<br>probably largely going to be determined<br>by global factors although New Zealand<br>does have a unique opportunity and that<br>respect very quickly we play one thing<br>we did play around with with the Swiss<br>and German modelers was the cost of<br>batteries one of the great difficulties<br>with the assumptions and this model is<br>it seemed like every time you agreed an<br>assumption deutsche bank would come out<br>with another report saying hey Petra<br>course are going to drop another twenty<br>percent over the next five years so we<br>thought rather than keep updating the<br>battery costs we would try and<br>bench market to what wick had originally<br>assumed which was 300 US dollars per<br>kilowatt hour for motor vehicle<br>batteries electric vehicles batteries we<br>updated it to sort of a bit of an<br>ensemble forecast based on analyst<br>reports and various things at the time<br>which was this number 340 new zealand<br>dollars which equates to 220 us which<br>seems to be a now what most of the<br>analysts are predicting for the next few<br>years in terms of battery costs per<br>kilowatt hour and then we went a bit<br>Tobit tony seba and went for what $75 us<br>a kilowatt-hour 115 kiwi and what you<br>can see interestingly and it just plays<br>to some of you may have seen i think<br>it's a bloomberg new energy finance<br>picture which I think has battery costs<br>along the x-axis and might be oil price<br>at the right axis and it's this lovely<br>little mosaic that has a whole lot of<br>lines going across if you end up in this<br>zone you end up with non plug-in hybrids<br>a few enough over in a zone with really<br>cheap batteries and cheap electricity<br>relative to wall you end up with let<br>your vehicle's or if you don't get that<br>you end up with ICS fascinating graph<br>and this almost reflects that that as<br>your battery costs begin to come down<br>and you actually originally see them<br>picked up by hybrid vehicles because<br>oils still relatively cheap enough for<br>it to warrant sticking smaller batteries<br>and cars to make more efficient use of<br>oil relative to the cost of electricity<br>bill den turning it into cars whereas<br>you do get to a point somewhere between<br>340 kiwi and 115 Kiwi we're all of a<br>sudden battery costs become so cheap you<br>might as well big stick big batteries<br>and cars suck the juice from the grid<br>and run them on that so somewhere in<br>there and we didn't explore exactly<br>we're somewhere between 340 and 115<br>dollars a kilowatt hour there's probably<br>a tipping point as a typical of these<br>very linear perfect foresight models<br>they just reach a point where they<br>switch and jump across to another<br>solution your sudden got a very Walker<br>outcome and the kayak scenario so that's<br>basically what we're trying to prompt<br>the model to do could you end up with an<br>uptake of significant electric vehicles<br>in a kayak world with a lowish carbon<br>price<br>similar to what you get and Waka in<br>terms of carbon emissions you can see<br>there that compared to current you make<br>some reductions in carbon emissions by<br>2050 only 4 million tons between now and<br>then versus getting a reduction of about<br>16 million tons between now and then<br>under the Walker scenario now the first<br>thing most people notice when John and I<br>put this chart up as you can see here<br>we've plotted the eleven percent below<br>1990 energy emissions as though it was<br>applied to the energy sector because and<br>not applied to the energy sector but if<br>it were just taken as a sub target and<br>applied to gross energy sector emissions<br>it would be that dash line there and of<br>course you only get there after 20 40<br>according to us now this is gross it's<br>ignoring sequestration forestry and all<br>that kind of thing so which of course<br>happens at the aggregate level but it is<br>interesting for people to say for all<br>that aggressive assumption and reduction<br>and driving behavior reduction the<br>motorization rate up take a public<br>transport rollout of renewables to<br>ninety-eight percent in the electricity<br>sector almost elimination of coal from<br>the supply chain your carbon reduction<br>target is not met tool around 2014 how<br>much money we're going to spend now this<br>amount of money here just before you<br>think that's really cheap it's just in<br>the electricity sector the 15 odd<br>billion dollars fifteen point four<br>billion dollars in kayak 14.4 billion<br>dollars and walker the the question<br>that's naturally Biggs is what does that<br>mean for prices which is the question on<br>everyone's lips when they see these<br>numbers what's going to happen to<br>electricity prices result of this now<br>this model is a fundamental model it<br>goes bottom-up just like it doesn't take<br>in an oil price forecast it actually<br>says what do I need to do to dig explore<br>extract and convert oil rather than<br>what's my or price forecast in the same<br>way as it does that for electricity was<br>it cost me to effectively explore and<br>build power stations you can infer<br>electricity prices from this and all I<br>can say is watch that spoke because<br>Aaron and I have some work to do<br>on that front to infer the long-run<br>marginal cost syllabus but it's<br>important to remember that once you're<br>talking about a 35 year time frame a<br>huge amount of your investment costs is<br>because of the economic retirement of<br>existing plant so you know depending on<br>what you assume about the life of a wind<br>farm or a geothermal power station 40<br>years is a long time for some of those<br>plants are existing now they have to be<br>refurbished or even more dramatic than<br>that we did assume in this the first<br>round of the modeling effectively<br>rebuilt the entire white a key station<br>white a key scheme in about 20-30<br>because it was end of economic life I<br>personally didn't see the concrete<br>coming out of those dams anytime soon<br>and so we did push the hydro<br>refurbishment out beyond 2050 but<br>certainly in terms of geothermal wind<br>and gas it's a very real consideration<br>and makes up a good chunk of the<br>investment costs here reflections on the<br>results I'm sure you've got a whole lot<br>of frictions on the results which we can<br>talk about in a second because we're<br>going to do QA heavy interplay of<br>electricity renewables transports<br>emission reductions that on the emission<br>reduction chart here just to be clear<br>about two-thirds of this difference<br>between kayak and Walker in 2050 is the<br>transport difference so that's your<br>electric vehicles coming and running on<br>renewable electricity so their interplay<br>between the sector's John talked about<br>at the start there's no longer one price<br>there's these multiple prices it's<br>heavily interconnected very much came<br>through in the modeling in terms of<br>understanding where emissions reductions<br>could come from that includes that<br>double whammy of renewable abundance<br>transport is going to be the place where<br>we can leverage that and I didn't<br>actually talk about solar I will just<br>quickly go back that was my mistake back<br>here in electricity the solar is I mean<br>it looks tiny on that chart that's<br>production per year but in kayak the<br>market lead scenario it's equivalent to<br>a solar panel of three or four kilowatts<br>on the roof of every second house in New<br>Zealand nine hundred and fifty thousand<br>households and the kayak scenario and<br>the Walker scenario it's only three<br>hundred and fifty thousand households so<br>you get a lower uptake of solar<br>and the Walker scenario than you're<br>doing kayak remember we didn't subsidize<br>solar so a lot of people associate high<br>solar uptake with government getting<br>involved in subsidizing we didn't do<br>that so it was actually the growth that<br>came out of the kayak scenario that kept<br>driving you up the cost curve that<br>ultimately triggered the higher solar up<br>tape so one solar panel on every second<br>household to me seems quite different<br>from today John do you want to finish on<br>these slides or you want me to oh yeah<br>scenario thinking so just back up the<br>truck a little bit from before the<br>results you know it's years since Peter<br>Schwartz wrote the art of the long view<br>which was sort of one of those seminal<br>texts on how you do good scenario<br>thinking and sometimes I wonder why we<br>don't see more good comprehensive<br>scenario thinking going on that's<br>because it's flippin hard it is really<br>hard and John used the word anguish<br>before we thought of plenty of things<br>that we would have liked to have gone<br>into the scenarios but you had to force<br>yourself to be disciplined as it<br>plausible as a coherent as a distinct<br>are we just doing the ending magic<br>happens type assumption so the slow<br>methodical process of identifying credit<br>those nineteen critical uncertainties<br>paid dividends in the long run we can<br>trace every single one of those results<br>back to a discussion that happened at<br>group if on the first workshop so that<br>we can audit that whole thing and that<br>pay dividends the long run and gave us<br>that touch point to go back to keeping<br>the story lines away from what we think<br>will happen a scenario is not what you<br>think will happen it has to be just a<br>plausible thing of what might happen and<br>particularly because a lot of people<br>were tempted to say I your market lead<br>kayak scenarios and they just kind of<br>the scenario wherein at the moment I'm<br>sure a lot of you have wondered that<br>isn't that just that current status quo<br>for continued on and actually until you<br>are someone more now tell me another<br>tell me another story and it forces you<br>to go back to your kayak assumption guy<br>are we being extreme enough in terms of<br>error maybe the status quo could be<br>pushed out a little bit and so<br>constantly we were disciplining and<br>challenging ourselves to be a bit more<br>extreme and doing that with 20 project<br>partners around the table all<br>were magnificent and that exercise I'd<br>say was real challenging reality is<br>we're going to peddle somewhere between<br>excuse the pun on the kayak and walk a<br>thing we are going to paddle a path<br>somewhere between those storylines we<br>don't say we're going to paddle up the<br>middle I don't know where it's going to<br>be between those two all we've done is<br>say out here are two plausible wouldn't<br>even call them boundaries or extremes<br>the sort of a couple of standard<br>deviations away from the mean maybe<br>where we go in there don't know we can<br>talk about that we can argue about it<br>and you don't have to agree with those<br>scenarios storylines because all we you<br>have to accept us at that plausible a<br>lot of people are looking for wild cards<br>are looking for breakthrough<br>technologies are looking for that kind<br>of thing and the storylines there are<br>one or two in there carbon capture and<br>storage and soul of costs coming down<br>and battery costs coming down but to<br>package a whole lot of them together and<br>have the was definitely not the<br>Goldilocks but the sort of the<br>Magnificent breakthrough and all<br>technology scenario would have lost some<br>credibility and as ice at the end<br>there's no substitute for anguishing and<br>constantly revisiting even energy<br>intensity caused us probably more<br>headaches than just about any other<br>waters new zealand's energy intensity<br>going to be if it goes on each of these<br>things does that make sense what's going<br>to happen to industrial versus<br>commercial versus residential spent a<br>lot of time on that so in terms of what<br>we've achieved here first and foremost<br>we think it's a robust framework to<br>start talking about some of these things<br>in many ways the project raises more<br>questions and actually answers you look<br>at some of these things you just going<br>on why does that happen do I agree with<br>it would you really run out of cheap<br>renewables and start building coal plus<br>CCS or gas plant again and a kayak does<br>that seem plausible you know it is 35<br>years away that's the kind of<br>conversations we wanted to start but to<br>have I guess a common vocabulary to do<br>that rather than ever i'm turning up<br>with their own little model that they<br>are done we think that the platform on<br>that and the vocab area on which this is<br>based as something that we can all use<br>and as John and decatur before has<br>already been staying to picked up be<br>picked up by government yeah so<br>got was there one more sorry yeah<br>complexity Plus speed equals uncertainty<br>from John's first slide and scenarios<br>very much helpful to move us outside of<br>those ideological biases that we<br>typically have all of us have a set of<br>biases that influence the way we think<br>about the future we hope these scenarios<br>challenge those biases and tell as you<br>the question maybe there are other<br>stories and there and also we don't have<br>to make those disconnected unrealistic<br>assumptions we have to stay disciplined<br>to that and the modeling models just the<br>output model is just a function of the<br>inputs you stilling stick into it<br>there's nothing magic about it but it<br>does help you reconcile a lot of those<br>more complex dimensions such as the ones<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
