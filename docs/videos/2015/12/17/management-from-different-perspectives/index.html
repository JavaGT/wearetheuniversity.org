hero nor<br>era Hydra Mikoto hydron I caught up at<br>all good evening ladies and gentlemen my<br>name is Neil quickly i'm the vice<br>chancellor of the university of waikato<br>it's my pleasure to welcome all of you<br>to this inaugural lecture by professor<br>catherine pablovich inaugural lectures<br>are a very important part of the<br>university tradition they mark what is a<br>very important milestone in the career<br>of an academic relatively few of our<br>staff members appointed at professorial<br>level or promoted to professor and their<br>appointment or promotion to that<br>position always signals a very<br>significant research contribution that's<br>important to the university because of<br>course it is our contribution to<br>research that marks universities from<br>other tertiary institutions and which is<br>the primary driver of our international<br>standing as a university so thank you<br>for coming this evening and thank you<br>for joining us helping to celebrate<br>Catherines appointment as a professor<br>it's now my pleasure to introduce the<br>Dean of the what kind of management<br>school professor Don Ross to make a few<br>introductory remarks for Catherine's<br>picture<br>thank you guys Chancellor honor very<br>pleased to have the opportunity to<br>introduce professor captaining captain<br>Calvert students evening professor<br>paddles is a futurist and your teaching<br>and research explores new forms of<br>organizing for developing human<br>flourishing in a post-cabinet world<br>these new forms of organizing begin with<br>the development of technologies that<br>include modulus empathy and reflexivity<br>to better understand usually<br>co-constructed environment mr.<br>perspective is evident in your teaching<br>and research on leadership and<br>entrepreneurship naturally as some who<br>the university has seen fit to promote<br>to professor professor Collins has an<br>extensive CV and we could not begin to<br>review all of it or even much of a<br>proceeding I'll just direct attention to<br>a few of its harlot she has altered over<br>80 academic papers three of these of<br>hearing an international refereed<br>journal she has recent publications in<br>such a world leading journals as tourism<br>management the Journal of business<br>ethics and the Journal of business<br>venturing chief her teach her her sorry<br>she's the co-editor of the journal of<br>management spirituality and religion<br>she's guest edited the addition of the<br>australasian<br>leadership journal of management and<br>organization she's currently on the<br>executive committee of the academy of<br>management this is a five year this is a<br>five year ten year leading one of twenty<br>four divisions of interest groups at the<br>academy it's a leading professional<br>association for scholars dedicated to<br>creating and disseminating knowledge<br>about management and organization and<br>it's one of the oldest and largest<br>scholarly management associations in the<br>world so a distinguished range of<br>scholarly accomplishments a<br>distinguished publishing career a<br>distinguished research administrative<br>career with global dimensions she brings<br>great distinction to the school to the<br>Wakata School of Management and to the<br>University of Otago she has an<br>interesting and unique research<br>expertise corner of research expertise<br>and we very much look forward to hearing<br>her remarks the city congratulations<br>my corners appeared around 4 billion<br>we succeeded in disrupting the balance<br>Phidias in a single lifetime the earth<br>has been more round and change and by<br>you know that the solutions are there<br>today<br>I've always been intrigued by the<br>statement we have the part of change but<br>what are we late waiting for this<br>implies our shift in our understanding<br>leader at the top of the hierarchy that<br>says come follow me and the followers<br>follow on we're talking about a gentle<br>leadership that resides in each and<br>every one of us knowing that our actions<br>do make a difference this implies our<br>shift in our understanding and awareness<br>of our responsibilities Ahmet what we do<br>matters so this means asking those big<br>existential questions Who am I why am I<br>here what is my purpose no purpose isn't<br>treasure the batch the boat in the<br>beamer that purpose is an hour legend<br>wash do we want to be known for what do<br>we get up for in the morning waters that<br>that inspires us that would even die for<br>this means no longer living in a bubble<br>is as somehow we are here and we're<br>disconnected from out there it means<br>folding back out in a landscape and<br>looking at our own interior now this is<br>more than self-awareness this is<br>self-awareness and other and we're pneus<br>and most of that space in between this<br>is what I'm going to talk about today<br>now one of my students rather write a<br>poem on this but I don't think he's here<br>work has now passed struggle to turn the<br>corporate machine your money they burn<br>hope is now frail for those who live<br>behind the veil but alas on wings does<br>the new born leader saw in sale for<br>workers now brothers drive and learn and<br>the corporate machine keeps the earth<br>clean through the new conscious leaders<br>so this old story where my own laws on<br>top of this hierarchy created a world of<br>separation between self and other it's<br>an extractive economy where we don't<br>have responsibility for those board<br>actions it's a world of winners and<br>losers however I do believe we're<br>writing a new story we're in the middle<br>of this great big shift we are<br>interdependent we are dynamic we have a<br>deep ecological way of actually seeing<br>the world it is participatory and it's<br>about a collective consciousness so let<br>me give you some examples of what's<br>happening crowdfunding as a starting<br>point the Grameen foundation which set<br>up to give loans to those at the bottom<br>of the pyramid those loans have been<br>returned by 99.1 seven percent of people<br>so just because you could pour it<br>doesn't mean you're not going to be<br>honorable and repay the Kiva set up by<br>Jessica Jackley when she was in her<br>mid-20s all of us can just give twenty<br>dollars that changes somebody's way of<br>living our own give a little here in New<br>Zealand 27 million dollars has been<br>given to that and nearly four million<br>dollars in the past 30 days and of<br>course we've got our own social<br>innovation students here at Waikato that<br>are prepared to do good work<br>think they head up there thank you so<br>something big is happening and even in<br>the word of entrepreneurship we're<br>starting to see a significant shift<br>these bed packs that have got solar<br>panels on them so these kids can go home<br>and do homework when they don't have any<br>electricity I'm not sure what my<br>students using this as an excuse 450<br>babies die every hour because they're<br>born an impoverished conditions these<br>innovation around incubators $20,000 for<br>an incubator I mean that's just we can't<br>do that and so there's a lot of<br>innovation creating these small baby<br>backpacks and is even some here in New<br>Zealand as well as are being developed<br>kibosh a different way of using food<br>they go around and they collect food<br>that's no longer than used and give it<br>to those that actually need or in Italy<br>if you can't pay your water bill you can<br>actually pay it through good deeds<br>something big is happening where they<br>get between self and other starts to<br>close when we want to do these good<br>works just to help those that are less<br>well-off than ourselves they understand<br>we have the power to change they are not<br>waiting I am a management educator my<br>purpose is to help my students<br>understand what's what it's like to live<br>in a biocentric engagement knowing what<br>they do matters knowing that they live<br>an independent interdependent complex<br>environment<br>that they leave my care and those of the<br>rest of us being ethical and socially<br>conscious and knowing that there are<br>ripple effects for what they do now of<br>course I've been talking about these<br>things for quite a long time some people<br>call me weird and when I asked to<br>develop a course on spirituality in the<br>business school people said what that<br>the University did say yes and globally<br>we were seen as a world leader for<br>making that shift the interesting things<br>now is that this is mainstream according<br>to The Huffington Post you're probably<br>part of it I call it the consciousness<br>crowd so what I'm going to present to<br>you today is just a slice of my research<br>around the self other relationship I'm<br>calling the snow it of wisdom it comes<br>from the Greek word noesis which means<br>inner wisdom direct knowing it's about<br>our own subjective experience but within<br>an ant elected global world William<br>James calls us a metaphysical quality<br>because it involves self and other and<br>there is aspect of transcendence as well<br>i first came across this idea of noetic<br>when i went to a spirit and business<br>conference in san francisco i have 15<br>years ago and i heard of the know it<br>institute of noetic sciences this was<br>set up by captain Edgar Mitchell who was<br>the sixth man to walk on the moon and<br>who commented that when he was flying<br>back to the earth he would look out of<br>the window and it was a sense of such<br>profoundness and/or and he would just<br>start to cry and cry and cry he couldn't<br>accept<br>not but he knew that the science and the<br>reality that he had been grown up with<br>was not the full story that the<br>molecules in this body were actually<br>constructed those in the past the<br>present and would go on in the future<br>and so he came back to earth and he set<br>up the institutional ethics Sciences to<br>look at that relationship between<br>science spirituality and consciousness<br>for some strange reason I was always<br>drawn to that and they also have this<br>much bigger network of people like ten<br>twenty thousand people so there's always<br>don't get the opportunity to mid meet<br>Edgar and it's a it's like touching<br>Stardust before I go on to talk about my<br>research and my contributions around<br>this noetic way of looking I just want<br>to try an activity with you I want you<br>to think of someone who brought out the<br>best in you what did they do and how did<br>they make you feel and if I gave you<br>some time you probably come up with<br>comments like this they excited and<br>empowered you they were fun to be around<br>the helped you understand the bigger<br>picture and gave you meaning in life how<br>did you feel you felt later you felt<br>relaxed and you're engaged in some forms<br>of laughter whatever they were if I else<br>do the opposite think of someone who<br>brought out the worst in you you'd<br>probably come up with comments like this<br>they were bright chrome managers they<br>blamed others here you get you get it<br>you don't need me to read this okay you<br>know so when you're with someone that's<br>making you feel good you're feeling<br>bigger room you're with someone that's<br>not making you feel good you're closing<br>down<br>and so we have some physiological<br>evidence while living in the good at she<br>is a good thing to do a biology biology<br>calcium so really feeling bigger our<br>parasympathetic nervous system is being<br>activated our blood pressure goes down a<br>heart rate goes down and our pulse rate<br>goes down it means that our immune<br>system means being activated to its full<br>ability on the other hand when you're<br>closing down your sympathetic system as<br>being activated that means your blood<br>pressure goes up your heart rate goes up<br>and your pulse rate goes up this is<br>significant and fix for leadership so<br>now we understand I hope physiological<br>effects we also have psychological<br>effects of feeling good like this<br>Barbara Fredrickson came up with this<br>idea of broaden and build through<br>positive emotions so when we looking at<br>this noetic wisdom we're looking at<br>these qualities such as gratitude<br>humility courage compassion and what<br>they do is broaden our scope of<br>awareness so actually we have a bigger<br>view of life if we're a leader we can<br>make better decisions because we've got<br>a broader scope of information that's<br>coming in we also have a better focus of<br>attention there are significant shifts<br>in our understanding of what leadership<br>can be about and secondly it builds our<br>own inner resources so we can become<br>more resilient and times when we need<br>that resilience to overcome some<br>difficulties so we've got physiological<br>evidence and now psychological evidence<br>why living in the good is better for us<br>and contributes to human flourishing one<br>of the things I do in the classroom is a<br>my students to do artwork I hope my<br>this particular piece of artwork was a<br>hand-blown glass dragon can you imagine<br>that and he talked about symbolizing<br>it's a dragon so it's fierce but it's<br>not real and he made the connection with<br>his own mind monsters they're equally<br>fierce but not real and so the question<br>we all have the power to change so what<br>are we waiting for it's about shifting<br>those my monsters into the positive that<br>is what I'll talk about now and so I've<br>come up with the framework around I<br>technologies which is I the technologies<br>of self that involve mindfulness<br>reflexivity and empathy and this<br>conceptualization that I did pull<br>together to get me a best paper award at<br>the Australia New Zealand academy of<br>management last year so we'll start with<br>mindfulness as I said it's a new hot<br>topic now Time magazine Scientific<br>American Newsweek they are all talking<br>about mindfulness what is mindfulness<br>well we all know what this is like but<br>what we need to be hopefully aiming for<br>and I really like this photo because<br>it's a reminder to myself when my mind<br>is really full just to be quiet and<br>serene no matter what is going on around<br>us which is course as you know is really<br>difficult the folks at the Center for<br>mindfulness at the University of<br>Massachusetts Medical School which is<br>Harvard have come up with a mindfulness<br>training program they put people through<br>a<br>two minutes a day walking meditation<br>sitting meditation and half a yoga<br>program for eight weeks I'm only showing<br>you two of their quite significant<br>results okay so you can see the blue the<br>control group versus the red which is<br>those that have gone through the program<br>there is a significant difference here<br>up to eight weeks this is the effect on<br>the left hippocampus which is we're<br>learning and memory is located okay so<br>meditate for 40 minutes a day guys and<br>you'll have a great increased brain<br>plasticity you're also regulate your<br>emotions so you become a better leader<br>and that you don't rush into things<br>before thinking them through the second<br>one I want to show you similar results<br>quite significant results the<br>temporoparietal Junction that's where<br>that broader perspective taking takes<br>place when you have greater empathy and<br>passion compassion that is significant<br>for this divided bridging of the self<br>other relationship so we now have<br>physiological evidence psychological<br>evidence and neuro imaging neural<br>science evidence to show us that living<br>in the wood actually does matter it can<br>produce different types of leaders<br>people that act people that know their<br>responsibilities for a broader world<br>people that understand that the impacts<br>of these clothes might have on the<br>people making them and that there are<br>human rights issues being addressed<br>people that understand what's in our<br>food subway sandwiches people that<br>understand what's happening in our<br>environment one of the surprising<br>outcomes was it was the yoga that seemed<br>to make the most impact on us so no<br>expected that and I think that was<br>because the yoga is such an action based<br>activity so it just helps hide quite in<br>the mind I can see some puzzled faces<br>here no that's not me so what am i doing<br>about it well I've developed a technique<br>for my students to learn develop through<br>right through a reflective journal<br>writing and as you can see they've been<br>a few publications their 2007 the this<br>technique has got more complex but has<br>also become a lot simpler this was<br>picked up by the Open University in<br>Australia with 3,000 students a year<br>through this and they put them through<br>this program so now and again I do get<br>emails from students that have gone<br>through this saying well I found it<br>really helpful so I ask most students<br>it's really simple to hid the heart the<br>hand the head describe a situation that<br>you had what happened simple hard part<br>the Hat how did you feel I've always<br>hate stuff what emotions did you feel<br>just identify a couple go down what does<br>it mean where did you feel it in your<br>body can't talk well feel sick I mean<br>there's a lot of signs that we get from<br>feeling at on our body and of course the<br>hands what are you going to do to change<br>the situation in the future the trick is<br>after they leave me that they know about<br>the head heart in the hand but they can<br>identify it as the heart the head in the<br>head which means I'm knowing myself<br>better where's we are am I feeling this<br>in my body whoops make sense of it and<br>means becoming more of a witness of<br>ourselves without rushing and boots and<br>all better decisions from leaders it<br>also means we have a different<br>relationship with things and we list<br>judgmental so there is a shift in the<br>way we understand the world so the<br>reality is most of us don't have 40<br>minutes a day to sit down and meditate<br>even though i know the stuff but just<br>taking a few minutes every day does<br>matter after we look after our bodies<br>when do we take time out to look after<br>our brains in our minds it's really<br>important the second concept I want to<br>talk about is this notion of reflexivity<br>now my colleague n come ruff who is she<br>is the 50th year distinguished professor<br>appointment at Bradford she's come up<br>with this framework which is our about<br>edge I and we I've changed it into<br>pretty pictures here but it the stuff<br>out there you know the building you all<br>know that I where do I set this notion<br>of being reflective journaling but the<br>thing we forget is this idea of we that<br>space between us how do we reframe that<br>because as we become less judgmental<br>that and have a different relationship<br>with things that starts to change and so<br>she and I have both got a real strong<br>and Trust in using art in the classroom<br>to create these reflexive students who<br>know about this relationship between I<br>and we I included this peacock that took<br>I've talked her nearly 20 hours to do<br>that's pretty stunning and she talked<br>about needing to learn the virtue of<br>patience mindfulness and she<br>metaphorically spoke about her journey<br>of self actualization which of course<br>was like the peacock I digress what anna<br>and i have done is identified three<br>practices that engaging in art dance<br>this is about performing art which means<br>we're no longer just have their<br>cognitive abilities in place like an<br>academic text but we have our full self<br>have our emotional self our spiritual<br>self we bring everything together and so<br>we identified three aspects that doing<br>art does first of all the challenges<br>that triggers awareness so this student<br>did this board identifying her strengths<br>and weaknesses and surfaces what's often<br>not apparent and so she talked about<br>singer weaknesses and wanting to rub<br>them out we're doing this artwork and<br>may enable you to say I can embrace this<br>this is who I am and work with it in a<br>different way this notion of embodiment<br>where do you feel it in the body and a<br>lot of those students talk about later<br>you number them talk about being<br>involved in teamwork and feeling that<br>what they have to say doesn't matter and<br>how it touches up the stomach and does<br>things to them so it's about being aware<br>of of those different aspects in the<br>body secondly at challenges assumptions<br>and we've got these masks that store it<br>students draw in terms of which which<br>self is it that I'm presenting and also<br>allows us to use multiple voices when<br>they're doing art they can be somebody<br>else and feel what it's like being in<br>and finally transforming this notion of<br>curiosity and she's here popping out of<br>the the box saying that instead of being<br>judgmental which is what she silt<br>thought she was she's able to be curious<br>and that way around her so this is about<br>changing our mindset in the way we look<br>at the south of the world not being<br>judgmental driving down the road getting<br>really cross at someone that's really<br>slow instead of being cross twisting it<br>around to say I wonder what's happened<br>in their life that they are really upset<br>and need to drive so slow it's about<br>having a different mindset the third one<br>this deer we sold as my granddaughter so<br>I can hear and see happy faces here<br>isn't she beautiful we can immediately<br>feel that effective emotional empathy<br>and we're making sense of it so we<br>understand cognitive empathy as well<br>which is what the literature talks about<br>but what I'm positing is there is<br>actually a third part for empathy and<br>let me show you this the steer we soul<br>only after a couple of hours after this<br>photo was taken was in hospital having<br>serious surgery so many of you will feel<br>something and i'm not sure but i could<br>feel there was a shift in energy here I<br>know some of you would have felt it as<br>well so there are two things that might<br>help explain this the first one is this<br>idea of Marie neurons ten years ago the<br>neuro scientists discovered sorry<br>identified they didn't discover identify<br>these things with Marie neurons which<br>means the same neural pathways in the<br>brain are activated weather we're having<br>that experience or whether we're<br>observing that experience happening how<br>can that be the neuro scientists say<br>that these mirror neurons mediate our<br>capacity to share with others so what<br>we're suggesting if there is this<br>hearing going on how can that happen so<br>I'm suggesting that at the quantum level<br>we are connected through that deep<br>interconnection that deep empathy and<br>I'm feeling another's pain and joy it<br>becomes their own forming an under<br>their whole significant shift in this<br>idea of a collective consciousness and<br>how there are so many people wanting to<br>help the other in some way we understand<br>that it's the atomic level the world is<br>made up of particles but at the<br>subatomic level we know they are waves<br>as well so information has been passed<br>through waves have any of you suddenly<br>thought of someone that you haven't seen<br>or heard from a long time and suddenly<br>you see them or they phone you up how<br>can we explain that I think most of us<br>have had that experience it could be<br>that information is being changed flow<br>through at that subatomic level okay<br>this might be really weird for some<br>people but I do believe that this idea<br>of quantum empathy can help us explain<br>this shift between more endless changing<br>this relationship between self and other<br>interesting II love Don talked about my<br>role at the academy of management this<br>has ten thousand international delegates<br>at their conference every year and I did<br>get a best paper award for this strange<br>idea and out of that several things<br>happened one was I did get invited from<br>that best paper to be on the leadership<br>committee for this particular division<br>at the academy second we were invited by<br>Rutledge to write a book on this<br>particular topic those of you that Jake<br>Adamek know that Rutledge is one of our<br>top academic publishers and thirdly we<br>got it into an a journal the Journal of<br>business ethics this paper has been<br>quite well sited without being despite<br>being weird and an of wide variety of<br>journals clearly the management ethics<br>journals but also design thinking men<br>academy of management /<br>does which was one of our top journals<br>even a neuroscience journal and a<br>medical journal how can there be all<br>good stuff so we're just trying to<br>challenge the way that we think about<br>this I other relationship and we can<br>start to see that collective<br>consciousness being played out and so<br>many environments / tag are right ha<br>trade with you that happened after the<br>event in Sydney people want to show that<br>they care and they have been so many<br>other examples around the shift in the<br>way that we see the other many of you<br>might be saying yeah that's really<br>interesting hmm what's this got to do<br>with business so I put together a<br>research project interviewing 15 leaders<br>/ entrepreneurs around the globe and I<br>particularly focused on something that<br>was quite extreme these people have all<br>moved to emerging economies solely<br>solely to help alleviate poverty these<br>are not social enterprises these are<br>social business they have to make a<br>profit to stay in business to fulfill<br>their purpose here is one yoga wear<br>clothing which started off as yoga<br>clothing but then moved into leisure<br>clothing she spends six month a year and<br>barley working this with those people to<br>try and make organic cotton mainstream<br>she says to me the inspiration is not<br>about making money I want to be part of<br>normalizing a more ethical and conscious<br>form of business here's one of my<br>favorites free set again it's a Oakland<br>couple he said he used to roam the<br>streets of all condenses I need to move<br>somewhere else to really make a<br>difference so his wife himself and<br>therefore<br>young children moved to Calcutta they<br>rented a house and in the middle of the<br>night they understood there in the<br>middle of the largest red light district<br>so he knew what his purpose was<br>surrounded freight changing the system<br>for some women creating freedom so he<br>set up a textile business he said mostly<br>you would employ people in a business<br>like mine based on how good their sewing<br>skills are but he employs his women<br>based on their need for freedom and<br>changing cycles and you said some of<br>them are hopeless at sewing and my cast<br>off of orchard when you engage with<br>poverty he says something changes about<br>you and he talks about humility is the<br>greatest thing when your selfishness<br>rules you can't see it because you tend<br>rain Africa the most beautiful bath and<br>body products which unfortunately we<br>can't get in New Zealand made in South<br>Africa all handmade the same story she<br>wants to change the system the people<br>that are through a virtually<br>unemployable in her hand and her land<br>it's not about profit it's about making<br>a positive difference to other people's<br>lives educating them medical care giving<br>them hope my final business example<br>there's one of my roles is at the<br>academy of management last year was to<br>organize the plenary session so I<br>decided to be really cheeky and decide<br>you asked some really top strategy<br>guides like Jay Barney and Otto Sharma<br>not expecting them to say yes and they<br>said yes they talked about their own<br>spirituality and how that shaped their<br>business their academic careers they<br>also agreed to let that talk to be<br>published in a<br>journal which is kind of pretty cool<br>showing their own shiftin awareness and<br>consciousness jay said he could never<br>say this in corporate America but he<br>said the reason my many of my leaders<br>are successful is because they love<br>I'm going to leave the final words to my<br>students also my ex-students because of<br>awfulness management educators we don't<br>really understand the impact that we do<br>make on them but for some of them we do<br>last year I was at the sustainable<br>network awards and one of my ex students<br>came up to me Sarah and we started to<br>chat the next day on Facebook I see that<br>I mean I'm 32 quite surprised but yeah<br>the second slide you won't be able to<br>read don't try I just wanted to pop up<br>you to show you I'm not making it up but<br>a few a month or two ago I got this<br>email out of the blue from a student who<br>was mine in 2010 and she talked about<br>being a silica my class I don't know<br>that usually I can pick it up they<br>didn't know that with her she was very<br>career faith focused and wanted to work<br>for you know a really high-powered<br>corporate which she did and she emailed<br>to hit me here to say water challenging<br>experience it was she's now in a<br>different business environment and she<br>thinks about my calls all the time and<br>tries to pot in place what she learned<br>so this kind of cool that someone that<br>was quite cynical actually went into<br>business and did start to make a<br>difference as well my final student has<br>another exchange is going to pop up here<br>Gemma investigating and applying the<br>ideas previously mentioned has had a<br>significant impact on my leadership and<br>perspectives in business I feel awaken<br>to the interconnectivity that exists not<br>just in business but in the everyday<br>life I feel a greater sense of<br>responsibility now I know what I do to<br>seek more than turn a profit I feel more<br>fulfilled as I interact with people that<br>are understanding self-awareness and the<br>intersubjective space between myself and<br>others my focus has shifted from profit<br>maximization into conscious and<br>purposeful engagement and my dream of<br>being a highly successful businesswoman<br>knowing is engaging and connecting in<br>business to make profound difference not<br>necessarily having a highly profitable<br>enterprise so in conclusion I hope you<br>agree we are in the middle of a big<br>shift a shift in consciousness a noetic<br>way that helps us bridge that<br>relationship between self and other my<br>research contributions are developing an<br>ontological shift in mindset in the way<br>we see of the world this is not just<br>about self-awareness this is much bigger<br>than that it's a reframing of who we are<br>we all have the power to change being<br>conscious means we're not waiting for<br>others and so I also developed<br>theoretical frameworks that people can<br>actually put in practice the heartbeat<br>in hand quite simple and practice<br>examples of organizations that actually<br>are part of this big shift and a<br>practice way so I'd just like to<br>conclude<br>Thank<br>else Jones and it's my D&amp;C to thank<br>heavens for dual inaugural proper story<br>lecture and giving us some insights both<br>on to pinterest search into your<br>teaching approaches and how we also<br>might view the world differently mixing<br>her psychological and physiological<br>aspects in leading leadership in the<br>differences of that can make<br>particularly around mindfulness<br>reflexivity in empathy and the way that<br>we can organize and manage ourselves<br>lead to negative so it's my real<br>pleasure now to re-approach in and thank<br>yeah we don't have questions that we do<br>here to carry on conversations</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
