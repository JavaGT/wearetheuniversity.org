This common problem can cause brain damage, and often requires baby to go into an intensive or special care unit, separating Mum and baby just as they are trying to establish breast feeding in the critical first days after birth. For more information visit the hPOD Study page here http://www.liggins.auckland.ac.nz/hPOD.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the research team at The ligans<br>Institute have been interested in caring<br>for babies with low blood glucoses for a<br>long<br>time low blood sugar levels are common<br>newborn babies and they if they're bad<br>enough can actually cause brain damage<br>we know that some babies are at risk of<br>having low blood sugars and generally<br>the only effective approach is admission<br>to an intensive Care Unit putting up a<br>drip separating the baby from its family<br>it's expensive it's unhappy for the baby<br>and the family we were Keen to try and<br>find a better simpler way of treating<br>this common<br>problem we found that you can put sugar<br>in a very high concentration gel and<br>what we do is rub that inside the baby's<br>cheek got some yum yums for you that<br>means it gets absorbed across the inside<br>of the cheek puts the blood sugar up<br>very quickly what we found in that study<br>was that the babies who received the<br>sugar gel were about half as likely to<br>need some other kind of treatment for<br>their low blood sugar<br>levels the exciting thing about the<br>dextr gel is that it is simple and safe<br>and it works to improve baby's blood<br>glucose<br>levels so we thought if it works well to<br>treat babies with low blood sugar could<br>we use it to prevent babies getting low<br>blood sugars so the new study is called<br>hpod hypoglycemia prevention with oral<br>dextrose we're looking at preventing<br>hypoglycemia low blood sugar levels by<br>giving the gel to babies early before<br>sugars for H pod we're looking at about<br>2 ,200 babies this is a very big study<br>it means we're going to need to do it in<br>a number of hospitals around New Zealand<br>and we need a lot of help to do that<br>from a lot of babies my name's Jenny<br>Rogers nice to meet you hi Jenny if<br>mothers are interested in taking part<br>they need to sign the consent form and<br>make sure that we know when the baby's<br>born so that the baby can get the<br>treatment at the right time my Midwife<br>told me that because I have gestational<br>diabetes my baby will be at risk of low<br>blood sugars but I'm not sure why that's<br>important that's important because if a<br>baby a newborn baby experiences a low<br>blood sugar it could actually affect<br>their ongoing brain development we're<br>asking mothers to take part in the trial<br>if they are likely to have a baby who is<br>known to be at risk of having low blood<br>sugars that means mothers who have any<br>kind of diabetes mothers who are likely<br>to have a baby who is either smaller or<br>larger than average or mothers who are<br>likely to have a a baby who was late<br>pre-term so 35 36 weeks gestation if I<br>do decide to take part what will happen<br>we would check soon after baby's born as<br>to whether baby's eligible or not to<br>take part in the study and at 1 hour of<br>age a gel be rubbed inside the baby's in<br>a check most babies will already be<br>feeding at that point it's not meant to<br>interfere with feeding it's just in<br>addition to breastfeeding at that time<br>because this is a randomized trial the<br>computer actually decided which gel your<br>baby receives it could either be a<br>dextrose gel or it could be a placebo<br>gel which is a gel that does not contain<br>sugar are there any rks to my baby no<br>dextrose gel is already used to treat<br>babies it's already appr proven safe<br>treatment then after giving the gel all<br>other care for your baby will be exactly<br>the same as it would be for any baby<br>after the birth she was<br>given a gel into her mouth it's a little<br>bit of a blur but I do remember he was<br>lying on my chest and they gave him some<br>gel they would just put a little bit on<br>their the gel on your finger and just<br>rub it into his gums um he was<br>completely happy with it it was a rather<br>easy non- complicated experience we're<br>hoping that what this trial will show us<br>is that receiving a dose of dextr gel<br>soon after birth prevents low blood<br>sugar levels in the long term we would<br>hope that that would prevent brain<br>damage that that would improve the<br>outcome for development and learning of<br>these children I'm glad we did it and my<br>advice for any other mother would be to<br>use HP pod um yeah it's been great for<br>us a lot of people probably wouldn't<br>think that it's that important but it<br>could make a big big difference you're<br>really lucky charie is a little ibf baby<br>and so we only have him thanks to the<br>advantages of um medicine and really<br>what been done through some of these<br>studies so anything that we can give<br>back and help out with definitely at the<br>moment as many as a third of all babies<br>are born at risk but the number of women<br>with diabetes and the number of women<br>having preterm or large babies is<br>growing steadily so that it's a large<br>number of families who might benefit<br>from this treatment if this is a<br>successful treatment we expect that it<br>would be used in most parts of the world<br>this treatment we think will really<br>revolutionize the way babies are managed<br>around the world and that's millions of<br>families who will be better off as a<br>result of this treatment</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
