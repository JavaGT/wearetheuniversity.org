font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>when students first arrive from overseas<br>the first comment they say is that New<br>Zealand is really beautiful which I love<br>to hear Oakland is such a diverse and<br>vibrant City it's got such a good<br>cultural and art scene and it's got<br>stunning beaches and<br>Parks I have a very deep love for the<br>ocean and ockland is surrounded by the<br>ocean and sometimes I just walk down<br>Queen Street to the World front I enjoy<br>my<br>day I chose to study at Auckland<br>University because I identify so much<br>with the Kiwi culture I'm the type of<br>person that likes going out and doing<br>things and like having something on all<br>the time like there's heaps to do<br>there's always tons on like if you look<br>for something you're going to find<br>it when our International students<br>arrive we really try and make sure that<br>the chicken process is really easy that<br>they've got good internet connection to<br>be able to contact home and tell them<br>that they've arrived safely into the<br>country we also make sure that we have<br>staff at touch base with them regularly<br>and that they're also in contact with<br>the international office so they've got<br>a wide support right from day<br>one when I first arrived everyone is new<br>here so they all felt the same way as me<br>and they try to be nice to<br>you the best thing about living at a<br>rock is is like having a family most of<br>all it's the staff that look after us<br>but the roommates are like brother and<br>sisters to us sometimes we study<br>together sometimes we go out together<br>most of the time we hang out in the<br>games room and playing pool and going to<br>a<br>gym homesickness can be an issue<br>especially cuz there might be language<br>barriers and cultural barriers as well<br>to overcome we are very aware of that<br>and make sure we have extra support but<br>also making sure they're also keeping in<br>good contact with their family and<br>connect them to different resources as<br>well to make sure that they feel at home<br>here living at Grafton is kind of like<br>living in in a peaceful little bubble in<br>the middle of Arland City like we have<br>these beautiful green grounds and it's<br>really peaceful inside as well and I<br>really like that cuz it's nice to be<br>able to come home and just like<br>relax we have a range of events here at<br>the University of Oakland to make sure<br>that all of our students can be engaged<br>with the wider community so we have<br>regular sporting competitions but some<br>cultural competitions as well so we have<br>had Walker armor at the beginning of the<br>year we recently had a football<br>competition Talent Quest and debating so<br>there's lots of things for to get<br>involved with I think there's many chefs<br>so you can try variety of food and<br>dessert it's make me really happy cuz<br>they are yummy they are really<br>tasty it is only 5 minutes from the<br>faculty of engineering and the rec<br>center and the gym it is very<br>convenient my advice to anyone thinking<br>of staying at Grafton hall or any Hall<br>of residence is to just do it because<br>it's a really good way to make friends<br>and to establish a routine R and it's a<br>really big step to the whole university<br>experience</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
