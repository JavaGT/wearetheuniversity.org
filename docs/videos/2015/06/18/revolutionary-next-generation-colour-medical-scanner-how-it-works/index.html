Professor Anthony Butler’s University of Otago, Christchurch, public health lecture on the revolutionary MARS colour medical scanner.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening ladies and gentlemen my<br>name is Peter Joyce I'm Dean University<br>of Otago Christchurch and it's my<br>pleasure and privilege to introduce each<br>of these public lectures we have these<br>most ears that accept immediately<br>post-earthquake this year there are sex<br>this is the second of six public<br>lectures tonight speaker is associate<br>professor Anthony Butler now Anthony<br>went through the Otago Medical School<br>and did his clinical years of his<br>medical degree in Christchurch and I<br>remember him from when he was a student<br>ISM undergraduate medical student he<br>then trained in radiology through ken<br>Reed District Health Board radiology<br>services but while he was doing his<br>radiology training he did a part-time<br>PhD at University of Canterbury in<br>engineering and he and his father have<br>been leaders in developing this Mars<br>imaging perhaps the most notable recent<br>achievement last year the Ministry of<br>business innovation and employment gave<br>them a 12 million grant which will be<br>shared between University of Canterbury<br>and University of Otago to build the<br>first human mile scanner I think I've<br>already volunteered to be the first<br>subject skin in this new machine and<br>hopefully over the next few years we<br>will have a prototype of a human model<br>for thus imaging and very layperson<br>terms people say what's it's about I see<br>well in the old days the x-rays were<br>black and white and 2-dimensional and<br>this is 3-dimensional color radio Grady<br>ology as a simple description but<br>without more ado and over to Anthony who<br>will now talk to you about Mars<br>thank you Peter and thank you for coming<br>on what's a beautiful Christchurch<br>summer evening or autumn evening so I'm<br>going to be talking to you about Mars<br>which we consider a new form of medical<br>imaging I've got a picture here of Mars<br>image that it's a mouse and it's got<br>iodine and barium and it's cheesecake<br>I'll explain a bit more about that as we<br>go on as Peter said this is a<br>collaboration between various<br>universities so University of Otago has<br>been very key in the development of<br>particularly around applications<br>development but has been getting more<br>into the maths in the computing in<br>recent years University of Canterbury<br>with its engineering school has been<br>doing its physics department have been<br>very involved from the basic to tech to<br>science behind us and CERN which I'll<br>talk about during the talk which is a<br>particle physics group in Europe who<br>discovered the Higgs boson we've used<br>some of their technology and we<br>collaborate very closely with them so to<br>give an overview of my talk I'm going to<br>give you the goals of our team I'm gonna<br>introduce the team and explain what CT<br>is and about two slides and then I'll<br>talk about the Mars spectral CT and then<br>I'll go through the possible areas of<br>clinical impact and I've actually just<br>limited this down to places where we've<br>done preclinical imaging in this this<br>medical school so where I've got<br>pictures to show you how it might<br>actually work then I go off and talk<br>about some physics and some engineering<br>for a while as I go through the basics<br>of the technology and then I'll wrap it<br>all up so our goal is to provide new<br>information about tissues that that<br>means we want to measure things and<br>tissues that other people haven't been<br>able to and as we do this we were always<br>thinking in the back of our mind it's<br>one thing to do it in the lab but we<br>want to do it in the hospital we want to<br>turn this technology into routine<br>clinical practice and I think that is a<br>critical part of we're being involved<br>with the medical school changes your<br>focus from if you were just involved<br>with an engineering school we've got to<br>translate this to the clinic we've got<br>to try and get this into Medical year<br>into routine use so it introduced a team<br>we're about 30 people across<br>Christchurch it depends a little bit how<br>you count we're currently 15 PhD<br>students I used to introduce Canterbury<br>is that the as the engineering and no<br>Tiger doing the medical side of it<br>there's a little bit more blended than<br>that now because while Canterbury is<br>very largely physics and engineering<br>they've also got a biology department<br>working with us and oat Argo which has<br>done the cancer and the orthopaedic<br>research stuff with us as I said now<br>getting a bit more into the mass and the<br>computing and behind it Lincoln<br>universities also involve<br>particularly as we get to moving from<br>mice to larger animals unfortunately<br>despite Peters request we'll probably<br>have to put a large animal and before we<br>put up a human on and Open University<br>where they've got some detector<br>physicists we have a number of<br>international partners soon as I<br>introduced earlier which is a<br>high-energy physics lab and one of the<br>world leaders in particle detection Mayo<br>Clinic which has some of our technology<br>and has been publishing papers are in<br>sale a politic which is upstate New York<br>and as the they tell me the oldest<br>bioengineering Center in the US Notre<br>Dame and many others we've got a number<br>of commercial partners one of the things<br>that the government likes in New<br>Zealanders they don't want to just do<br>research for the sake of research which<br>we can it's a topic for another another<br>evening they're very keen to make sure<br>the benefits get across society and by<br>that they mean they want to see<br>companies formed they want to see people<br>getting jobs and the universities have<br>spun out a company to commercialize this<br>technology we work with a couple of<br>local companies interlink research<br>shamrock fabtech assembly specialists<br>which are local engineering firms so a<br>lot of the design happens within the<br>universities and then we get local<br>industry to manufacture it and very<br>acade well not actually very<br>occasionally<br>today is a nice example we bring them<br>into the university we show them what we<br>need done and they go away and they do<br>it and last year the university of otago<br>partnered with GE healthcare to look at<br>the clinical applications of this there<br>are now a number of major medical<br>imaging vendors looking at where this<br>fits on their 2025 2030 roadmap so I<br>think that's actually very exciting<br>because a few years ago people were<br>saying that this would never take off so<br>put a bit of background this is about<br>particle detection in this case x-rays<br>and Ernest Rutherford started particle<br>physics just across the road at the Art<br>Center so one of the nice things when I<br>go and visit universities overseas if<br>I'm in a physics department I can say<br>I've worked in the same place rather<br>fir'd worked and that usually gets me<br>somewhere Bates and Peters worked out<br>and the electrical engineering and then<br>Moore and through the hospitalization<br>before the med school was really as it<br>was getting going they<br>the first people to publish a use of<br>Fourier transform in CT now that's<br>actually quite an important step because<br>through the late 70s it was a major<br>method of doing the so-called CT<br>reconstruction and then later on it was<br>replaced by the filtered back projection<br>which is a slight variant of it in a<br>1972 unfortunately about a year after<br>Hounsfield published his first pictures<br>they produced their first pictures<br>so those Christchurch scientists in fact<br>got the idea built it very independently<br>and I've even read the Nobel Prize<br>Citation for hounds field and there's a<br>two paragraphs of being saying and we<br>acknowledge that a group in Christchurch<br>was about do it independently so what a<br>CT CT is something you have in the<br>hospital we'll start back off a standard<br>x-ray systems this is an x-ray system I<br>haven't seen one operating like this<br>there's pictures of it around you have<br>an x-ray source which really haven't<br>actually changed very much from this<br>picture there they might change a lot on<br>the next twenty or thirty years as<br>technology changes we have an object and<br>if we're in a hospital we'll call that<br>that be patient we have a detector and<br>in this particular case it's a variant<br>screen so the x-rays are hitting it the<br>fluorescent screen is glowing and then<br>we have a pattern recognition system<br>sometimes called a radiologist who is<br>looking at that and interpreting it okay<br>now what we've been focusing on is<br>changing that detector system okay so as<br>I said with that detector system it<br>glows more x-rays that had it the more<br>it glows as we got more advanced we went<br>to film and that would record that black<br>and white picture and it meant the<br>radiologist didn't have to sit in the<br>x-ray beam things went digital but<br>essentially the more it glowed the more<br>use that was all you saw this is a CT<br>system it's really just a 3d x-ray<br>system so you have an x-ray source here<br>shining an x-ray beam and a row of<br>detectors this is what the one in the<br>Christchurch hospital looks like I just<br>pulled it off the web and it's so-called<br>GE multislice 64 multislice and that<br>produces pictures like this so this is a<br>picture<br>3d picture and it's through someone's<br>chest and inside we can see that they<br>ought has shown at white the bone shown<br>at white<br>tissues of showing up gray lung and here<br>showing up black so that's a black and<br>white 3d picture so what happened in<br>radiology well CT got very very good<br>between 1998 and 2005 CT was growing at<br>about five or six percent a year<br>they were just going in all over the<br>place and then it started slowing down<br>so what happened in that time why did<br>the CT do this huge rush of development<br>and installed base and I think we might<br>have sort of abouts have to count the<br>DHB has probably got between about five<br>and seven CTS and placed scattered<br>around like oncology in the community at<br>the moment so there's a big boost but it<br>stopped and what was what it was was<br>what's called the slice Wars so cetys<br>became various fast and they have very<br>small boxes so when I started as a<br>radiology trainee and 2000 it used to<br>take about five minutes to scan the head<br>and even longer to actually print it out<br>on film and we had slice thicknesses of<br>five millimeters or ten millimeters<br>right now if I walked into the hospital<br>and I thought you had cancer I could<br>scan your head to your toes probably and<br>under a second the bit that basically<br>limited by the speed that you can<br>accelerate the patient through the<br>circle you don't want them flying off<br>the end of the bed and you can do it in<br>about three four five hundred micron<br>voxels so they be as I said they became<br>fast and they became very high<br>resolution and that's a little bit like<br>your digital camera you used to care<br>with your buying a 1 megapixel camera a<br>2 megapixel camera but once it got to 10<br>or 15 megapixels no one cared it was<br>good enough so anatomical or morphology<br>or the shape is now really good going<br>faster and getting more detailed doesn't<br>add much we can take a picture of as I<br>said the chest and the abdomen of a<br>person under a second and get pictures<br>like that but it's still black and white<br>what people actually want to know is<br>what is at issue is that cancer is that<br>normal tissue if it is cancer is it<br>growing or is it shrinking<br>what's it cell metabolism is it turning<br>glucose over very quickly is it<br>expressing cell surface antigens these<br>kind of questions and then you move on<br>to the treatment I've given a cancer<br>drug did it actually get into the tumor<br>I want to know what dose what proportion<br>Doce Gabe got inside the tumor so<br>researchers want to know the<br>constituents of the tissue the fat the<br>water the calcium and the iron they want<br>to know about cancer and pathogen labels<br>and they wanted to measure physiological<br>markers<br>it's not about shape it's about<br>biochemistry so that means we need two<br>fundamental change and the information<br>provided by x-rays which leads me on to<br>this what is my spectral CT so x-rays<br>come in different colors wavelengths<br>energies frequencies depends on your<br>high school physics teacher and that net<br>respect they're just like visible light<br>they're part of the electromagnetic<br>spectrum if we talk about visible light<br>everyone's happy to call them red green<br>blue but if we just shift to a slightly<br>higher energy towards x-rays we've got<br>the same phenomenon red green blue<br>different energies and we can measure<br>them so this is a picture of a standard<br>CT scanner you might remind you a little<br>bit of that very old picture I had a 2d<br>system if an x-ray source putting out a<br>range of x-ray frequencies colors or<br>wavelengths they pass through our<br>patient they're attenuated in the<br>patient and then you have a grayscale<br>detector that gives you a single<br>Hounsfield unit this is the brightness<br>and that voxel cutting-edge technology<br>Christchurch Hospital put one and about<br>a year ago the so called dual energy and<br>they have two x-ray sources putting out<br>different colors that pass through the<br>person and you have two black-and-white<br>detectors and you get two points on the<br>attenuation curve this is actually a<br>little bit like the way movies went to<br>Technicolor in the 60s by having several<br>different projectors instead of having<br>an all-in-one one pixel like your modern<br>projector would we're suggesting we move<br>to the next step will you go back to<br>having an ordinary x-ray source putting<br>out all the different frequencies or<br>energies they're attenuated and then you<br>have a very clever color detector that<br>can separate them out and then you get<br>multiple points on the attenuation curve<br>and that's really nice because that<br>attenuation curve is specific to every<br>atom which means you can work out what<br>atoms are inside people so as I said<br>spectral imaging is now possible this is<br>a fourth-year student we had a few years<br>ago<br>standing by a machine and that<br>particular machine was shipped off to<br>the Mayo Clinic we came up with an<br>acronym MIDI pixel resolution system<br>importantly it's got energy resolution<br>spatial resolution and temporal<br>resolution that is we can measure the<br>energy we measure when the x-rays<br>arrived and we measure where they<br>arrived current single energy scanners<br>as I said a brightness only that<br>grayscale in their spirit spatial<br>temporal resolution we called at Mars<br>because it sounds futuristic and as easy<br>to spell for the house adjourn under<br>busy night on call so some examples of<br>this this is a that first Mouse I showed<br>you we take some heavy items and that<br>means they're a long way up the periodic<br>table such as iodine barium and get a<br>lynnium and these have very specific<br>peaks and their attenuation called cages<br>now if we can measure that x-ray energy<br>if we can measure that x-ray energy we<br>can use them in combination so we can<br>use two at once we can start to use new<br>fat we have new pharmaceuticals and say<br>that pharmaceutical got to that part of<br>the body okay so in this particular case<br>we put it into a mouse this was this<br>guy's called Mouse 12 is famous in a<br>group and we put bear him into the lungs<br>and we put iodine into the heart and<br>then we actually a 2d x-ray and you can<br>see the barium and the the lungs and the<br>end the trachea as well as the iodine in<br>the heart and the big blood vessels is<br>all white as I see it if you're only<br>measuring brightness they're just white<br>the bones are white because Kelsey<br>Martina rates a lot so we can't tell<br>which is which<br>if we do a 3d x-rays CT of that we end<br>up with a nice pretty picture of our<br>mouse but we still can't actually tell<br>which is bone which is barium which is<br>our team where they are and here's the<br>same Mouse emerged on our scanner we can<br>see these are assigned colors to them<br>but in fact the red is with the eye<br>Adina's blue is where the barium is<br>white as we're the calcium is and we're<br>water as we've made it gray so that's<br>four separate channels of information<br>that's not Photoshop that's not someone<br>going in and painting<br>colors on after the fact that is the<br>x-ray energy that we've used to tell<br>which material it is so we've got<br>quantitative material imaging now the<br>next step is to take it through to<br>humans we can do a mouse we actually<br>want to do a human which means we need<br>to go from detector arrays this big to<br>to this big this is going to take a wee<br>while it's not an easy task we've<br>promised the government we'll have it<br>done by 2020 and I think it's probably<br>going to take about 30 to 100 people in<br>Christchurch to do this which is an<br>exciting challenge it's quite nicely the<br>in essence Canterbury University is<br>doing a lot of that the engineering as I<br>said the medical school we're doing a<br>lot more of the mathematics and the<br>computing and then here within the<br>health precinct Tiger University intends<br>to host it to enable clinical trials so<br>we'll have it by 2020 and by 2025<br>hopefully we'll have done a few clinical<br>trials and I'm hoping I can offer Peter<br>the first first option sowhat's of the<br>benefit of this what is the clinical<br>impact of be able to do this what are we<br>looking at at the next six years what<br>are these first clinical trials can be<br>about well we've been working with you<br>orthopedic Department so this is a<br>picture of someone's knee replacement<br>they've had arthritis and they've had<br>one part of the knee replaced if we want<br>to image that it's let's keep our<br>engineering easy we'll do that in five<br>minutes let's keep the spatial<br>resolution quite low do it down to 0.2<br>of a millimetre 200 microns relatively<br>easy imaging target but we what the<br>other Pods want to know is did this<br>metal implant fuse with the bone now<br>that's actually unfortunately really<br>hard for them to measure at the moment<br>because you get all these artefacts all<br>these stars appearing off the end of the<br>metal because of the way it interacts<br>with the x-rays so in this case we took<br>an implant that was actually developed<br>by a local company called osis it was<br>put in a sheep bone and then they grew<br>together and if I blow that up you can<br>see that we can clearly see at the<br>submillimetre scale how bone and metal<br>are fusing and so right now Deden<br>enables a company like osis to make<br>their implants better and<br>the orthopods to start learning about<br>what sort of shapes and how bone it<br>interacts with metal and we can do that<br>on the small scanner and then when we've<br>got a human scanner we can start looking<br>at these implants and how they go on<br>people so we could start doing a knee<br>replacement and a person follow them<br>over time and say this design of knee<br>replacement worked better<br>this one didn't it's look at something<br>else in the joints this is some work<br>again with the orthopedic Department on<br>arthritis and particular osteoarthritis<br>one of the problems with osteoarthritis<br>is you actually don't see physical<br>changes too many years after the<br>biochemical changes occur and particular<br>one of the proteins called glycol amino<br>glycosides decreasing in the cartilage<br>before you start getting we're in the<br>way of the cartilage before the<br>cartilage starts cracking now if you<br>want the pods knew in advance that that<br>joint was giving them well they could<br>actually start treating it at the moment<br>they did they don't know until it's too<br>late so in this particular case we've<br>taken actually a bit of cartilage from<br>someone who had had their knee replaced<br>in the operation and we incubated it<br>with a marker that shows up on our<br>scanner and we can see and I'm going to<br>make this picture bigger with the<br>biochemical changes occurring so you can<br>as I said you can see here that the<br>surface is actually pretty good the<br>other half of this knee was terrible<br>which is why it was taken out but we can<br>see that this biochemical change is<br>right there and if this knee was still<br>inside the patient it would be a good<br>time to start treatment because you can<br>try and reverse the biochemical changes<br>before you start getting the physical<br>changes we've done a bit of work with<br>the rheumatologists on arthritis so they<br>have a number of diseases called gout<br>pseudogout etc that they had crystals<br>forming around the joints so we had a<br>summer student a year or two ago<br>comparing the the crystals that form<br>around here and at least Ana phantom so<br>that phantom means a bit of perspex we<br>put the crystals on we can tell that<br>they're all different so we should be<br>able to measure these we didn't start up<br>working with that not today me<br>University who have pharmaceuticals that<br>measure bone turnover and again they<br>produce their pharmaceuticals are so<br>called nano<br>cause with gold hafnium and gadolinium<br>and we've been able to measure them on<br>our scanner so I'd really like to see<br>that an and first of all some animal<br>models and in later and humans measuring<br>bone turnover and that would have a<br>profound effect on people who are<br>developing asked osteopenia another bone<br>to see disorders we've been looking at<br>the neck we've been looking at heart<br>disease and we've been looking at stroke<br>okay so heart disease or atherosclerosis<br>as one of the world's killers it causes<br>stroke it causes diseases in the league<br>and it can cause a heart attack<br>in particular in the neck if you get<br>atherosclerosis it causes a stroke and<br>people will come into the hospital with<br>a with a mini stroke they'll have a CT<br>scan and then you'll have to decide do<br>to an operation it would be nice to know<br>so we've been looking at this bit of the<br>body again easy imaging got five minutes<br>to do it people can lie still down to<br>200 micron what's going on inside that<br>bleed blood vessel wall that's wrong so<br>some of these people have operations the<br>head that's taken out that's better the<br>blood vessel it's quite a big operation<br>not without risk and we've emerged it on<br>our scanner and we've separated it out<br>into water calcium and lipid and we<br>compared it disdaining so show you that<br>so we can measure how much fat how much<br>water how much calcium is in that plaque<br>so if this was in the person's body the<br>question is would that rupture would<br>that go on and cause a stroke and we can<br>now measure it in a way that you'd<br>normally have to take out and do under a<br>microscope but we can do it inside the<br>the person we've started doing a similar<br>sort of thing and that this is in fact<br>with some sheep tissue from the butcher<br>where we wanted to measure the fat and<br>the water content of the meat and<br>separate them out it's in fact exactly<br>the same problem as doing it in<br>someone's Nick so here we've got a 3d<br>one this particular scan was done and<br>what I call the human energy range with<br>the appropriate amount of filtration so<br>if this was a human Nick that's the<br>quality of image we could get from the<br>neck<br>we will be able to see that there's a<br>big lipid-rich core here and therefore<br>likely to rupture there's a bit of<br>calcium there that's stable this is the<br>direction to the heart this goes to the<br>head so that in five years time I'd like<br>to be producing from a person we've also<br>started working with a group and<br>suddenly they produce pharmaceuticals<br>which tracked to a single cell line<br>called activated platelets and they<br>believe that these activated platelets<br>are critical and what you half the<br>Roma's go on and cause a heart attack or<br>a stroke and so they produce gold nano<br>they produce antibodies to these these<br>cell mines and they attach gold to their<br>antibody and we can see the gold on this<br>on our scanner if I blow that up this is<br>an ordinary CT of that bit of tissue<br>it's from someone's neck and one of<br>these is calcium and one of them as<br>we're the cell miners if you have an<br>ordinary CT you can't tell which is<br>calcium which of these activated<br>platelets if you have color scanner it's<br>easier to tell the one on the left has<br>activated platelets it's got micro<br>hemorrhage it's a plaque at risk the one<br>on the right is calcium it's unlikely to<br>be a danger plaque so what about the<br>long-term promise so we're working as a<br>civil with Notre Dame and they've been<br>looking heavily at cancer particles<br>where they will take surface binding<br>antigens on the nanoparticles and<br>ejected into the bloodstream they'll go<br>to a cancer and on a black and white<br>x-ray where they own got one thing to<br>look at they can say they can deliver<br>their drug containing the cancer to the<br>area but also pick all of the labels<br>that they make and they've got they're<br>literally they're funded to make a<br>library of spectral pharmaceuticals at<br>different x-ray colors so as it is<br>potential in the next few years to have<br>multiple targets in the same time<br>looking for the cell different cell<br>lines within a cancer so that's where I<br>hope we're going to go or we were<br>definitely going to go I hope we get<br>there quickly so what about the<br>underlying technology where did this all<br>come from so I'll come back to this<br>slide what<br>a happy 4th year student with his<br>preclinical scanner and they show you a<br>picture of it this is what it looks like<br>there's one in the mid school here and<br>three out at Canterbury there are<br>standard CT scan I showed you the<br>picture of the big one we have an x-ray<br>tube here and x-ray detector here our<br>color camera this Hulbert rotates around<br>and we put in a box it looks a little<br>bit like a barbecue it happens to be you<br>have lead around the outside so you can<br>stand beside it without having to wear<br>any extra protection this is a x-ray<br>camera it's called a MIDI pix camera<br>contains a MIDI pixel detector it's<br>what's known as a photon processing<br>detector or a photon counting detector<br>or a quantum detector and as I said high<br>energy physics was part of this story<br>and the reason for that is to measure an<br>x-ray beam if you want to measure the<br>energy the best way to do it is to<br>analyze every single photon one at a<br>time okay it's a pixelated detector<br>which is to say every pixel has its own<br>electronics and it's a spectral detector<br>which means measures the energy of the<br>photons it's been developed by the MIDI<br>pics - and MIDI pics 3 collaboration New<br>Zealand was a founding member of MIDI<br>pics 3 and it will be a founding member<br>of MIDI pics for probably later this<br>year and the goal of that collaboration<br>is to transfer technology from high<br>energy physics into medicine now what I<br>can't read or amazed even me was when we<br>first met this group back in 2005 there<br>was about 20 universities involved no<br>medical students no radiologists not<br>even any medical physicists they were<br>basically all micro electronics<br>engineers producing circuits and they<br>were doing a wonderful job and we came<br>along said well let's actually turn this<br>into from the physics lab into an<br>application and get it out there and get<br>it into use came out of high energy<br>physics so I'm part of the so-called<br>compact muon solenoid<br>experiment soon itself is 70 countries<br>six thousand scientists the famous for<br>developing the world wide web and a few<br>years ago five or 6,000 people got their<br>name on a paper for discovering the<br>Higgs boson this is a compact muon<br>solenoid<br>if I get my figures right I think it's<br>1,200 tons I mean it's huge it's a<br>hundred meters underground this thing<br>here in a cleanroom these are my holiday<br>photos by the way this in a clean room<br>here is a multi-million dollar detective<br>for particle physics okay<br>and envía is in the so-called silicon<br>barrel are all these particle detectors<br>that analyze the particles coming off<br>from the interactions one particle at<br>the time and that's the technology we<br>borrowed and tried to turn into medicine<br>so here's a going through that<br>individually this is one pixel our<br>pixels are 110 110 micron it's a<br>combination but for those we can measure<br>up to eight energies simultaneously<br>there's 5000 transistors per 100 10<br>micron pixel which means it's got about<br>as many transistors in it and the whole<br>chip as a HD horrible we then combine it<br>into 120 by 128 array which means that<br>if we've got five thousand transistors<br>pitch pixel and 128 by 128 array we have<br>about as many transistors as most<br>computers just in the x-ray detector now<br>you go back to my first picture of the<br>radiologist holding a screen there were<br>no transistors all ooh<br>analog the digital systems typically<br>used in the hospital have one or two<br>transistors per pixel and we're taking<br>it up to about 5,000 we can mean tile<br>bees into array our chips are 14 by 14<br>millimeters and we can tile them into a<br>linear array like that and make it<br>anything as big as we want these are our<br>current finger board so these are you<br>can they're about the size of my thumb<br>and the active area be the thumbnail you<br>can make a strip as long as you want<br>which means we can scale four three four<br>mice and 100 for a human this is a<br>schematic of it I will just quickly dive<br>into some some fun for that what happens<br>here is this is the schematic this is a<br>sensor layer a photon comes down if you<br>can imagine it's in the top layer there<br>and produces an electron hole cloud and<br>that's conducted down a pointer into<br>these electronics and that cloud is<br>analyzed and there<br>you measure win at that cloud reach the<br>electronics you measure how big it was<br>and then you record it to memory and<br>it's doing that one photon at a time<br>it's pretty clever as well because what<br>happens it's when that photon comes down<br>it doesn't interact typically in one pic<br>so it wouldn't direct some mini and it's<br>split between so one photon will go into<br>two two detector elements like this or<br>in this case four that's where the<br>photons are directing the charge is<br>split across four pixels one pixel takes<br>most of it and it decides I'm the winner<br>and then all the circuits have to add<br>that together and then allocate back to<br>that one pixel so you every photon<br>that's hurting that detector you're<br>doing this addition and allocation I'll<br>come on to the speed that means to be<br>done in a moment so what does that mean<br>well if we take something like an<br>emerson source and you scan it without a<br>ticker we can measure the x-ray spectrum<br>very accurately so we have a<br>spectroscope for those of you who did<br>undergrad physics and did spectral<br>measurements on on things we can do that<br>and every single pixel and as I said<br>we've got millions of pixels if we<br>didn't do that all that complex adding<br>of charge together the spectrum you<br>measure is blurred out which is that<br>dotted line so really having these fast<br>intelligent electronics make this sort<br>of technology possible which means<br>you've got new clinical applications and<br>it goes fast this is one of our partner<br>Institute's Thomas as has been to New<br>Zealand two or three times to work with<br>us and that's some work he did an x-ray<br>laser in Germany we have to do that at<br>about 10 sorry about a million photons<br>per second per square millimeter so all<br>about adding of charges together<br>allocating to a pixel you're doing<br>millions and millions of times per<br>square millimeter and you're doing it<br>for the whole scan which means middy<br>pixels fries are really really fast and<br>that gets me back to where where we<br>basically began we can do it in animals<br>we want to do it in humans I think we've<br>got to the point and I<br>the fact the government gave us as much<br>money to do it we've convinced our<br>funders and our partners that it's<br>actually worth doing there are going to<br>be health benefits that people are going<br>to Headley better lives because of us<br>people will live longer but actually for<br>me as a scientist I think this is a very<br>fun and very challenging project<br>so in conclusion speak people CT is the<br>future of x-ray imaging black-and-white<br>imaging I think we'll just go in the<br>next 10 or 15 years there's no penalty<br>in measuring the color at once the<br>technology is there you can do it for<br>example what when you had black and what<br>when Kodak brought out californee<br>everyone gave out gave up on black and<br>white film preclinical work is certainly<br>clarifying the benefits and I think<br>that's actually kind of an interesting<br>one<br>one of my colleagues Nigel Anderson<br>jokes he's got a list of 30 to 50 people<br>wanting to use a machine and he's not<br>sure which ones are going to work so he<br>has this work out this is a likely good<br>candidate we'll try that and then a few<br>of them do work and New Zealand's<br>building a human scanner so Peter here<br>is retiring in a few years and sometime<br>early in his retirement I hope I can<br>stack over machine thank you thank you<br>very much for that Anthony he's lips<br>good time for questions and discussion<br>so people have any for those who've been<br>fired that physics and anything else or<br>lots of ways to answer that the short<br>answer is going to drop dramatically the<br>the reasons for that is probably<br>actually what Louise's of radiography<br>tech who works here at the hospital so<br>I've worked with her before in different<br>contexts<br>the reason for that we can stop the<br>x-rays just as well as any other<br>detector so we're not we're as efficient<br>but on top of that we go to smaller size<br>pixels and that means you get less noise<br>through the image that you cut out what<br>they call the mid frequency noise and<br>then on top of that you've got energy<br>information<br>soft-tissue contrast goes up so that<br>really really helps you get much better<br>signal-to-noise we can measure down to<br>the so called par Sounion limit so you<br>can see the quantum model and the x-ray<br>beam okay and that means that your image<br>processing your mathematics changes<br>because you're now working at the noise<br>limit and so you can do fancy tricks<br>like under sampling your data and so one<br>of the groups we've worked with a little<br>bit which at stanford they believe the<br>dose will drop by 90% my personal view<br>is that that's probably achievable but<br>the bigger benefit is we're actually<br>able to do more with them so when I<br>talked about those slice Wars that does<br>x-ray dose of the population went up as<br>we did more scans and the scans had a<br>higher x-ray dose but the benefit to the<br>population was massive we could get rid<br>of a whole lot of scan intervention so<br>catheters and needles were being put<br>under people and do it on an x-ray<br>machine so even though you had a higher<br>dose the clinical benefit was much much<br>better in this case I think we're<br>actually gonna win on both ways I think<br>x-ray dose will drop dramatically and I<br>think the amount of information we<br>provide will go up dramatically yeah I'm<br>not sure I understand what you mean by<br>freely about we'd be published a lot<br>about at work right so you can read<br>about it and things but as you saying is<br>a someone who wants to come and use our<br>preclinical scanner what's available or<br>okay so okay so this is still at a<br>research level by 2020 we want to be<br>conducting clinical trials I keep joking<br>with people on the DHB that we need to<br>have one in clinical production by 2025<br>but that's a different question so as<br>technologies go through they they become<br>available to the public sort of late<br>down the process so the first human<br>scanners will be used for<br>search because you actually need to<br>understand how does it fit into the the<br>process of disease management and I<br>guess you know one of my personal goals<br>here when when I first got involved with<br>a sort of technology I was still a<br>radiology registrar still working on<br>Friday nights reporting car crashes and<br>I could see this technology and how<br>earth you take it from a physics lab<br>through to clinical use and shortening<br>that time down as much as possible and<br>for a pharmaceutical let's I think about<br>probably 15 20 years typically for<br>technologies like this if we can get it<br>into routine clinical practice by 2025<br>we're doing pretty well this will help<br>your children and Greig children it may<br>not help you yes yet single second er<br>yeah and in fact one of the nice things<br>is that we actually can use a very cheap<br>source because we want the equivalent of<br>YT x-rays<br>where is a the x-ray sources that are<br>being used and a GE Jordan energy system<br>are quite expensive because they're<br>trying to filter it down to be as<br>monochromatic as possible whereas we<br>actually want the broad range of<br>energies at current tubes used tungsten<br>yeah just standard off-the-shelf tanks<br>and tubes and in fact you know we<br>thought about how we're going to build a<br>human one one of our engineers worked at<br>a Lincoln University and they've got a<br>CT scanner for their their animal work<br>and he basically took an old g1 and got<br>it working and he could have sent<br>essentially did the same I don't think<br>would want to do it that way but it's a<br>nothing even becomes redundant and<br>radiology one of the things about<br>radiology as it grows remarkably quickly<br>I start as I said I started in the<br>radiology department in 2000 I think the<br>department must be 2 or 3 times as big<br>because it learns new applications as a<br>specialty so nothing really gets<br>replaced what happens as you find new<br>places to use it the most common study<br>in our radiology department still<br>there's a chest x-ray because you can do<br>them cheaply quickly you can learn a lot<br>of information about them so in that<br>respect I don't see anything being<br>replaced what this allows you to do is<br>get some of the information that you got<br>off an mr and some of the information<br>you've got appeared but a whole lot of<br>information couldn't get in the other<br>way so what I would think is it's going<br>to reduce things like biopsies and the<br>we're not sure what's going on so<br>waiting two weeks to do another study so<br>you've got another test you can do and<br>make that diagnosis earlier and start<br>treatment earlier I'll start with an<br>anecdote when I did I actually did an<br>undergrad physics degree as well and had<br>summer studentships from physics and two<br>there were medical school ones actually<br>worked in oncology and I had a<br>spectroscope and I used to have it in my<br>talk it's a picture of the spectroscope<br>was this big for a cool germanium thing<br>a trolley were the electronics on<br>computer beside her and now that says<br>you said 110 110 one of the questions<br>that then comes up is why would you go<br>smaller as I said the charge cloud and<br>that sense is quite big so you're going<br>to have to add across more areas across<br>more pixels but I've got a colleague<br>from prior cases charge hearing as my<br>friend because that's how I analyze the<br>particle so you may go down to what he's<br>pushing for<br>Media picks for MIDI picks 5 to think<br>about having pixel sizes of around 10 to<br>15 micron the electronics is possible<br>the bonding onto the sensor layer the<br>interconnects becomes pretty challenging<br>and then you actually have to think of<br>not a simple scheme that I had of just<br>looking at the nearest neighbors but<br>actually passing the charge across of a<br>very large number of pixels so we will<br>go that way<br>the question is wean them quite hell<br>yeah but there are certainly discussions<br>about how to do it yeah I think by<br>within 15-20 years you will be no such<br>thing as a black and white CT okay CT is<br>rapidly becoming the mainstay for term<br>room imaging anyway particularly anyone<br>who comes and I forget exactly what the<br>dhp protocol does anyone with two body<br>parts injured or mechanism above a<br>certain amount automatically gets a CT<br>because otherwise they used to come to<br>radiology and then they go back to ICU<br>and in back to radiology we just CT them<br>upfront<br>I think we're likely to do to use this<br>system like this in the future because<br>there's no point in doing a black and<br>white image when you can do a color<br>image as I said it so if you have got<br>black and white film and color film<br>while you'd always use a color okay the<br>only reason you potentially wouldn't<br>early on the technologies life is cost<br>but in 20 years this technology will be<br>the standard matura technology it will<br>cost the same as everything else so<br>you'll do it<br>all the ground applications then you and<br>your group put and cross my desk more<br>for signing off so I see what projects<br>are coming up but one of the ones that<br>struck me recently because you briefly<br>talked about different cancers hmm you<br>know one of the issues is how quickly<br>you can see a cancer shrinking not<br>shrinking and also related to that the<br>extent which drugs are wholly hitting<br>the surface of the cancer versus<br>actually getting in<br>all the cells in the middle you want a<br>level right here I will actually I<br>didn't include cancer except for one<br>sort of diagram because until a few days<br>ago I didn't have a pretty picture and<br>that's essentially when you're preparing<br>a presentation what pretty pictures so<br>one of the things about cancer in<br>general as you want to know whether<br>you're with your drug gotten and you<br>want to know the vascularity of what the<br>blood vessels are like in the tumor so<br>we've been working with a bunch of<br>groups here the gynecological cancer<br>group led by Pete Sykes<br>there's a group margarita and Gabi<br>looking at lung cancers and melanomas<br>and length and they produce<br>nanoparticles or some of the group's do<br>wear within this particle don't say 15<br>nanometers you can pack in gold and then<br>you can pack and drag okay now we can<br>see the gold quite happily so if you can<br>get that into the into the person you<br>can see what the uptake in the tumor was<br>and that gives you an idea of how much<br>of your drug actually got there okay now<br>there's also the ability which is what<br>Pete sites is doing you might assign<br>this off a week ago where he's producing<br>nanoparticles so those envelopes but on<br>the outside of the piece put in<br>luteinizing hormone so there are<br>selectively uptake within some of the<br>gynecological tumors so the gold gets in<br>there and we can see that those cell<br>lines exist in the tumor okay so that<br>allows you to say that's that type of<br>tumor and I was talking earlier about<br>you know maybe getting rid of the need<br>from for biopsy that's that's cell<br>tracking that's saying this type of cell<br>line is and this tumor and this part of<br>the body and therefore we need to treat<br>it with us kind of drug so it's still at<br>the early stages but it's very much on<br>the minds of the researchers here<br>because they're actually trying to do<br>this right now and the picture that I<br>don't quite have because the student<br>showed it to me on Monday this week is a<br>lung cancer in a mouse where the gold<br>has gone to the outside of the tumor and<br>we can actually start measuring the<br>vascularity of the tumor what are the<br>blood vessels like and he's very very<br>excited because he's been trying to do<br>that for awhile and I'm quite excited<br>because I've been wanting him to<br>for a while so are we interesting to see<br>where that work progresses over the next<br>year or two because we need to have this<br>preclinical work done and time for a<br>human scanner we've got to keep looking<br>in all these applications so when we've<br>got a human machine we know what we know<br>what diseases we should be studying on<br>it the question down here yeah this is<br>my son and I don't that's a for the<br>audience and for him that's that's a<br>bigger question perhaps to the<br>University but the university has grown<br>what it calls bioengineering and<br>nanomedicine a lot in the last five<br>years and it's a new direction that<br>medical research is going there's a lot<br>more looking at how computers help<br>medicine have mathematics helps medicine<br>had various bits of technologies such as<br>implantable devices engine tissue<br>engineering etc can help and that's very<br>different from the sorts of research<br>we've done when I was an undergrad at<br>the medical school in the 90s oh yes<br>still and I think there will be other<br>projects I'm not sure when and what are<br>the questions comments or not I'd like<br>to thank em to me in that in a normal<br>way but certainly from the I said I see<br>this is one of the most exciting<br>developments where Christchurch may<br>again lead the world in this area and I<br>think it's very interesting example of<br>collaborations across Henry University<br>ourselves others and Industry and terms<br>of the requirements for the government<br>funding so thank you and through but<br>that down the front from University of<br>Canterbury for all the work that's been<br>done over the last 10 years really but<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
