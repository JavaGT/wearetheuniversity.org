automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening ladies and gentlemen uh<br>welcome to University of otago and<br>welcome to the fifth of six public<br>lectures that we are doing this year for<br>people who don't know me my name is<br>Peter Joyce I'm dean of the medical<br>school here it's my pleasure tonight to<br>um she did her medical degree uh through<br>University of otago but did all her<br>specialty training as a nephrologist or<br>kidney specialist in Christ Church and<br>while she was in Christ Church during<br>that training she uh completed a PhD<br>with Professor Andre who was head of our<br>department of medicine at that stage she<br>then spent two years at Harvard<br>University in the United States and came<br>back onto our staff in<br>2011 um and it's great pleasure to<br>introduce her to talk about how can we<br>learn where the medicines work and are<br>you thank you very much Peter and thank<br>you everyone for um coming out to listen<br>to the talk and I'm very very glad that<br>I'm not competing with a very exciting<br>cricket match this<br>evening I'm going to talk about how we<br>know whether medicines work and how do<br>we know that they're safe for us and in<br>some ways it seems like a bit of an odd<br>question surely we know that medicines<br>work how can we not we use them all the<br>time we use many of them use them every<br>day what is it about them that we don't<br>know enough about<br>so what I'm really going to talk about<br>is are we testing the medicines that we<br>use in a way that we can then learn<br>about whether they can improve our<br>well-being are we actually testing<br>medicines to prove that they work in<br>ways that improve our health and I'm<br>going to suggest this evening that<br>sometimes we don't in fact a lot of<br>times<br>we actually don't test medicines in the<br>way that we need to<br>be a group in the United Kingdom<br>actually looked at the totality of the<br>information we have about medicines and<br>suggested quite<br>provocatively that approximately 85% of<br>the research we do about<br>medicines is a waste it doesn't actually<br>tell us about what we need to know know<br>about Healthcare it's a highly<br>provocative statement but I'm going to<br>suggest to you in many ways through the<br>lecture this evening about how that<br>might actually be true<br>because drug development and Medicine<br>testing in the world is a billion dooll<br>industry in fact in 2010 a quarter of a<br>trillion dollars was spent around the<br>globe on t ing medicines so it's really<br>important that we get it right and it's<br>really important that we spend the money<br>in the right places because as we know<br>money isn't doesn't grow on<br>trees to put this in another way in the<br>two decades between 1970 and 1990 for a<br>single drug that we were testing whether<br>it worked or not we gave 20,000 patients<br>in randomized trials<br>Placebo<br>treatment when we actually had enough<br>information about that drug to say that<br>it would actually have saved their lives<br>so we were continuing to do trials<br>through the 70s and 80s for a specific<br>drug when actually we had enough<br>information in those trials to actually<br>show whether that medicine worked or not<br>and so this problem is actually<br>continuing and I'm going to show you how<br>I'm going to suggest that we get<br>information about<br>medicines absolutely all the time we<br>often don't realize that we get a lot of<br>health information in our daily lives on<br>the internet on the TV telling us what<br>we should and shouldn't be doing in<br>terms of our health behavior and which<br>medicines we should be taking and here's<br>just a very simple<br>obvious um example this is from the<br>National Health Service so this is our<br>equivalent of the Public Health Service<br>in England this is their website about<br>choices about choices we should be<br>making and they here are talking about<br>water and actually they give us very<br>specific advice about water and how it<br>will improve our<br>well-being women should drink eight<br>glasses a day we've all heard that<br>before men should be taking 10 glasses<br>of water or fluid a day that is very<br>specific health information that we<br>receive and what we need to know or need<br>to understand is where does that come<br>from and is it<br>true here's another example it doesn't<br>take you very long to find these on the<br>internet one about<br>probiotics and this evening's talk is<br>not about probiotics it's about the<br>health and information that we receive<br>and in this example it's saying that<br>probiotics Target and help against<br>infection of our gut and improve our<br>well-being so we're surrounded by health<br>information on a daily basis how do we<br>sort through it and how does the health<br>system sort through the massive amount<br>of information that we get about<br>medicines and health<br>interventions what we do is we try and<br>find for each particular disease and the<br>details of this slide don't matter we<br>try and find for each particular disease<br>a set of interventions or a set of<br>medicines or a set of drugs that we then<br>develop and trial and test and our<br>ultimate goal is to improve or reduce<br>that disease<br>process and what I'm going to argue this<br>evening is that we're not quite getting<br>to that end point of improving our<br>well-being through our drug<br>development so let's start with a really<br>simple question about how we even test<br>population we go right back to the<br>observational study so we have all the<br>way through our history observed the<br>world around us observed what natural<br>phenomena are around us and that is<br>helped us uncover important health<br>problems and actually solved them so<br>there's this lovely story and I'm sure<br>that many of you have heard this story<br>already of John snow in London in the<br>1800s and what they realized was that<br>there was a huge outbreak in central<br>London of people dying of a diarrheal<br>illness which was<br>cholera what Jon Snow actually did was<br>one of the most elegant observational<br>studies that has been done because no<br>one knew what was causing the diarrhea<br>no one could they didn't realize that it<br>was a particular bug so no one knew what<br>was causing the diarrhea and what Jon<br>Snow did was what was called Sho leather<br>epidemiology or Sho leather observation<br>where he literally walked the streets<br>and on the map he recorded each house<br>where someone had died from<br>chera and each house that had some death<br>in it was made black on his on his map<br>and what he showed was that the black<br>dots were all congregated in a certain<br>area and he drew an he drew a kind of a<br>natural observation or a natural circle<br>around that there were plenty of<br>theories abounding at the time about the<br>cause was it the air was it pollution in<br>the air was it elevation above the river<br>no one really quite knew why this was<br>happening and what he then showed which<br>was um very elegant was he then plotted<br>the water pumps in London at the same<br>time and what you can see is right in<br>the center of that circle is the water<br>pump for Broad Street and what he then<br>did was went to the community and talked<br>to them about this and showed them this<br>and the community were very surprised<br>about that result and they demanded that<br>the handle be removed from the pump and<br>the handle for that water pump was<br>removed and the chera epidemic started<br>to reced so that was a very elegant<br>observational study a natural<br>observation of what was happening around<br>us and what he showed was that everyone<br>who died had drunk contaminated at water<br>and no one who survived had um everyone<br>who survived had drunk clean water so<br>there was this natural division in the<br>population a natural observation showing<br>that it was the contaminated water that<br>was the cause of the problem and we've<br>done this for smoking as well elegantly<br>in the 1940s we've shown very clearly<br>that people who smoked have been uh come<br>into some trouble with early death and<br>smoking related<br>diseases so the observational study is a<br>very powerful way of understanding<br>public health and what's causing<br>disease but using observation to test<br>medicine is a problem and I'm going to<br>show you why so we can also use the<br>observational study to test<br>medicines and I'm going to show you a<br>very famous example where a group of<br>researchers divided women thousands of<br>nurses into those who were taking<br>hormone replacement therapy and those<br>who were<br>not and they Then followed those women<br>over a period of time to discover what<br>happened to them and the hypothesis was<br>that older women who were not producing<br>as much estrogen or progestogen as they<br>were if we replace that then that may be<br>a good idea and so the um the<br>investigators did an observational study<br>where they looked at what happened to<br>people women who had chosen to take HRT<br>and those who had<br>not and what they showed with this<br>observation was that women who' chosen<br>to take<br>HRT actually were much less likely to<br>die substantially less likely to die or<br>much more likely to<br>survive this was a very powerful piece<br>of information at the time in the late<br>'90s and I'm sure many women remember<br>the um the discourse around this the<br>fact that we were actually then went out<br>and promoted hormone replacement therapy<br>on a large scale it must be good for<br>us but observational studies actually<br>don't un help us understand where<br>medicines<br>work the problem with the observational<br>study looking at medicines is that the<br>chance that a woman is taking a medicine<br>is not random it's related to a whole<br>bunch of other things so the women in<br>this study who were taking hormone<br>replacement therapy were different from<br>women who were not in very important<br>ways that wasn't a random<br>thing and so what I'm I'm making up a<br>few things here but you could imagine<br>that women who were taking hormone<br>replacement th y in the study were<br>Health freaks or they were vegetarian or<br>they were more health conscious you<br>could imagine that they took maybe<br>different care of themselves maybe or<br>they were much more likely to have<br>different Health behaviors than women<br>who were not taking the medicine so<br>women who were not taking medicine or<br>hormone replacement therapy may have had<br>different educational opportunities or<br>may have had different priorities in<br>terms of going to their GP or not and<br>it's probable that the difference<br>between the two women and their<br>likelihood of surviving or not was<br>actually related to these other things<br>that the investigators couldn't measure<br>because these things are actually quite<br>difficult to<br>measure so here is where we talk about<br>the randomized trial and the randomized<br>trial overcomes many of the problems<br>that the observational study<br>has because the randomized trial which<br>was first really I think there's a<br>randomized trial report in the Bible I<br>hear but the one of the first ones was<br>in the 1940s where people treated uh<br>people with very Advanced tuberculosis<br>with an antibiotic called<br>streptomycin and the reason they did<br>that was because streptomycin was quite<br>difficult to produce we it wasn't<br>produced in the mass way that medicines<br>are now there wasn't very much of it<br>there needed to be an allocation of<br>treatment and the way to treat people<br>with tuberculosis was to randomly<br>allocate them to stripy or not to<br>discover whether it was effective so<br>that was one of the first randomized<br>trials so what happens in a randomized<br>trial is that people<br>are randomly allocated to different<br>medicines or different Health Care<br>interventions and their chances of<br>receiving a health intervention is<br>purely by chance and therefore those who<br>receive the medicine are very likely to<br>be very similar to those who say receed<br>the sugar pill and the only difference<br>between them is the fact that they've um<br>received the medication so they're<br>likely to have the same educational<br>opportunities they're likely to have the<br>same ability to see a GP etc etc and<br>this randomized Tri has been a profound<br>and amazing kind of Technology if you<br>like in the testing of<br>medicines you're sensing maybe there's a<br>big butt coming along but here is the<br>result following the nurse's study of<br>the hormone replacement therapy then the<br>Women's Health Initiative came along and<br>randomized women to either hormone<br>replacement therapy or not so that the<br>women were similar in every other<br>respect other than receiving the<br>medication and the reverse was found so<br>instead of women who received hormone<br>replacement therapy survived longer they<br>actually received harm from the<br>treatment this was a huge surprise at<br>the<br>time the expectation was that the<br>benefits of hormone replacement therapy<br>would be confirmed but they weren't in<br>very hazardous ways so women who took<br>hormone replacement therapy in the trial<br>had much higher rates of breast cancer<br>experiencing cardiovascular disease um<br>and clots in their lungs and so this<br>shows us that if we're testing medicines<br>we need to be very careful about how we<br>design our studies and how we actually<br>test the treatments that we need so the<br>randomized trial has been a fantastic<br>Boon for health research over the<br>decades but we're running into problems<br>and this we're still suffering from a<br>huge amount of waste when we're<br>measuring the effects of medicines for a<br>number of issues and the the there are<br>major problems with randomized trials<br>that are are preventing us from getting<br>the information that we need out of them<br>what I'm going to do now is talk about<br>some of those problems I'm going to then<br>talk about a new technology that tries<br>to overcome those problems and then I'm<br>going to talk about some solutions where<br>to from here we've got this problem how<br>are we going to solve things so one of<br>the problems with randomized trials is<br>we all know that we live in an absolute<br>information exp you know information<br>explosion we just simply need to look at<br>our email inbox or you know the amount<br>of information coming at us in our daily<br>lives is just extraordinary and the same<br>is for medical research so this is a<br>simple graph where if you were to Google<br>randomized trial and heart attack and<br>you look at the number of trials that<br>are available at each of these dates the<br>you can see that the curve is<br>exponential so when I was a medical<br>student in<br>1995 and I was trying to write an essay<br>I would only have to deal with about<br>6,000 papers and they would have all<br>been stuck in the library in physical<br>journals now now if I'm trying to write<br>the same essay I would have to deal with<br>25,000 pieces of information and those<br>pieces of information are now electronic<br>so they're<br>everywhere and you can see that in the<br>last decades the amount of information<br>has increased<br>tenfold and what this means in Practical<br>terms is that Health practitioners now<br>this was written 20 years ago Health<br>practitioners need to read 19 original<br>articles a day for<br>365 days a year to keep up to date with<br>their field well that's what it feels<br>like and this is increasing<br>exponentially so there's information<br>that shows that if a doctor does a<br>clinic during the morning for every<br>patient he or she sees there are two or<br>three important treatment uncertainties<br>for every single patient they see so we<br>live in a life of uncertainty and we<br>information and in the next 10 years the<br>amount of days it will take for the<br>amount of information on the internet to<br>double is only 73 days in the next 10<br>years so you can see that this problem<br>is only going to get worse and so we<br>need to develop ways of curating the<br>information that's coming at us in ways<br>that we can<br>use<br>the reports of Trials are actually<br>really hard to discover you could<br>imagine that research trials that are<br>really powerful really important really<br>exciting really snazzy are right out<br>there in front of us we don't actually<br>need to try very hard to find them<br>they're often on the Internet or in the<br>paper or on the radio or there's a TV<br>report so the really big exciting<br>positive trials telling us that things<br>work all right there in front of us but<br>the little trials the little trials that<br>say the medicine probably may not work<br>or the little trial where the results<br>weren't that clear or the little trial<br>where the researcher then went on to<br>something much more exciting tends to<br>get stuck in a drawer and what we know<br>is about half of randomized trials that<br>are ever done get stuck in the drawer<br>and don't actually come out into the<br>light of day or are in tiny little kind<br>of conference proceedings you know<br>little pamplets or little books they're<br>really they're notoriously difficult to<br>find and so you can imagine there's bias<br>in the amount of information we see the<br>really you know the really whizbang<br>types of Trials but we don't see the<br>ones that say the treatments don't work<br>so well and so therefore we get a skewed<br>view of where the medicin work this is a<br>very good example not all trials are<br>made public<br>so when a um industry player is making a<br>new medicine they need to ask a drug<br>Agency for approval for that drug to be<br>able to be prescribed out in the<br>community and they apply to things like<br>the Food and Drug Administration in the<br>United States or the European medicines<br>agency in the in the in Europe those<br>reports given by drug companies to those<br>agents IES don't need to be made public<br>and you can imagine that some of those<br>reports don't necessarily see the light<br>of day because they're not that<br>interesting there's stacks of them they<br>may not actually really say very much<br>they don't see the light of day the<br>really big trials do see the light of<br>day and what some um very clever<br>researchers back in 2008 showed was<br>actually if you take only the published<br>trials you show quite big effects of<br>anti-depressant therapy but when you<br>actually go away and find all those<br>other trials that were never made public<br>and put them into the mix the effects of<br>anti-depressants is not quite as big as<br>hoped so it depends very much where<br>we're getting our information from<br>whether when we're deciding whether<br>medicines work or not this is one of my<br>favorites trials say lots and lots of<br>different things it doesn't matter what<br>treatment X is it actually Happ s to be<br>a type of dialysis but these two reports<br>one on top of the other are from the<br>same major American journal for kidney<br>research one month apart and the top one<br>says that treatment x given to patients<br>improves survival and the bottom one a<br>month later for the same treatment says<br>treatment X did not affect survival what<br>on Earth are we supposed to think about<br>a medicine or a healthare intervention<br>and whether it works or not when we've<br>got a huge amount of information out<br>there that's actually clashing with each<br>other and actually saying different<br>things how do we deal with that how do<br>clinicians how do people writing policy<br>how does pharmac deal with whether we<br>should be using treatment X in New<br>Zealand if the actual research is<br>actually saying different<br>things and one of the key problems is<br>that trials are often too small to<br>discover the answer we are blessed with<br>a huge number of very very small trials<br>where they're just too small for us to<br>actually know what they<br>mean the the patients in one group may<br>do better than the other but because<br>they're so small we can't really tell<br>whether that's an important difference<br>whether it's a significant difference or<br>whether it's just by chance and in my<br>field and kidney disease the number of<br>small trials is absolutely extraordinary<br>and each individual trial can't really<br>tell us very<br>much so we are suffering from a huge<br>variety of Trials a huge amount of<br>information and that information if<br>we're not careful just looks like gobleg<br>and our ability to understand it and use<br>it in ways that improve our well-being<br>is that we're actually falling further<br>and further behind because of the amount<br>of stuff the amount of research actually<br>being<br>done<br>traditionally we have used reviews where<br>people sift through the information that<br>we have pick out the really really<br>important bits and put them into single<br>pieces of work and these are incredibly<br>popular as you can imagine because they<br>allow us to understand the body of<br>evidence in front of us without us<br>actually having to go and find and read<br>all the papers and one of the most<br>important ways of doing this is to ask<br>an expert to sift through the<br>information in their field of expertise<br>and tell a story we call it a narrative<br>review it tells a story of the evidence<br>as it<br>stands unfortunately the these narrative<br>reviews are highly cited they're very<br>popular people like reading them I like<br>reading them because they allow me to<br>understand a body of information very<br>very<br>quickly but unfortunately because<br>they're not done systematically for no<br>particular fault of the author or<br>anything they can give a picture that's<br>not complete shall we say so they draw<br>on information that the writer already<br>knows about but doesn't necessarily draw<br>on information that's hard to find and<br>so we run into a problem where the<br>narrative review come tell us the whole<br>story so my reason for getting out of<br>bed in the morning strangely enough is<br>the systematic review and the systematic<br>review I'm going to spend a little bit<br>of time on now to tell you a little bit<br>more about what that is so all the dots<br>on the screen just imagine that there a<br>single piece of information about a<br>particular disease or about a particular<br>medicine at the moment they just look<br>scattered disorganized we can't really<br>understand what they mean<br>systematic review means that I<br>physically go out and hunt down all the<br>trials for a specific research question<br>so for example does blood pressure<br>lowering when I have diabetes help me<br>survive for longer a good research<br>question and a systematic review goes<br>and hunts for every single piece of<br>evidence about that particular research<br>question and K it into some sort of<br>order using digital technology using<br>ways of understanding that information<br>to create a complete picture of the<br>evidence on that topic so I'm going to<br>give you a couple of<br>examples the first ever systematic<br>review is was done by James Lind MD and<br>the topic was<br>scurvy and the British Navy was being<br>scouted Ed by scurvy and no one really<br>knew what they could do about it and<br>James ly set about a critical and<br>chronological view of what has been<br>published on the subject so clearly this<br>information overload has vexed us for<br>centuries and what he did in the pre<br>internet era was literally go and find<br>every report that he could find I really<br>don't know how they were indexed I don't<br>know how he found them and looked at<br>every single treatment that had been<br>used for scurvy up until that date and<br>there were all sorts of things nutmeg uh<br>beef stock um<br>vinegar um and of course oranges and<br>lemons and he brought all that<br>information together in a single place<br>and looked at the evidence and<br>discovered that the sailors who<br>receiving oranges and<br>lemons recovered from scurvy and those<br>that received beef stock or vinegar or<br>oil this or nutmeg that it didn't really<br>make a difference and this was the first<br>ever systematic examination of the<br>evidence I love this little quote cuz<br>this was this is what my day job feels<br>like before the subject could be set and<br>clear and proper light it was necessary<br>to move a great deal of rubbish so he<br>had to literally sift through a lot of<br>stuff to actually get what he needed to<br>find and this discovery within 20 years<br>eradicated scurvy from the British Navy<br>and if he hadn't have done this you know<br>who knows what lands the British Navy<br>would have lost because they were all<br>too busy under the decks with poor old<br>scurvy so the systematic review even<br>then was a very powerful technology for<br>understanding whether something works<br>and he found that it was oranges and<br>lemons I'm going to come back to this<br>example that I gave right at the<br>beginning to show you how this happened<br>so this is the example where we had a<br>treatment but we kept on doing trials<br>even though we had the answer how on<br>Earth did that<br>happen and here is how it happened this<br>is what's called a forest plot kind of<br>looks like lots of horizontal trees<br>really but it shows you every dot is a<br>single randomized trial and every<br>whisker coming out the sides is how<br>confident we are about the result of<br>that randomized<br>trial and every dot on the left hand<br>side of the vertical line tells us that<br>the treatment was effective and every<br>dot on this side of that vertical line<br>tells us that the treatment wasn't<br>effective and you can probably Hazard a<br>guess that most of the dots are in the<br>right direction most of the dots are on<br>the left hand side of the line but<br>because the trials are all small and the<br>whiskers coming out of the dots cross<br>that vertical line that means that we<br>can't be sure whether that treatment is<br>effective or<br>not those Tri every single one of them<br>included patients and in total those<br>trials included 40,000 people what an<br>incredible um effort what an incredible<br>amount of energy and resource into these<br>trials and here is where systematic<br>review comes in because if you add one<br>trial and then you add the result of the<br>next trial to the first one and combine<br>them and look at that result and then<br>when you do a third trial you add that<br>to the two before it to find the result<br>and then when the next one comes in and<br>so on what do you find and this is what<br>you find it actually only took three<br>trials for it to be absolutely clear<br>that strepto which was the clock busting<br>drug of the day actually improved<br>survival actually saved lives and what<br>happened was another 40,000 people were<br>included in randomized<br>Trials because this organization of the<br>information this curation of the<br>information had never been<br>done now you might think oh that's in<br>the<br>1990s but I'm afraid this still happens<br>and so many of my much of my work has<br>been about actually putting all the<br>trials and kidney disease together and<br>showing that sometimes we don't actually<br>know whether treatments work even though<br>we've done a lot of Trials or even worse<br>we've kept on doing trials when we<br>probably should have stopped because if<br>we' Cur curated it like this we would<br>have discovered 20 years ago that a<br>treatment was safe or<br>harmful so systematic review is an<br>unbelievably powerful tool it's very<br>simple although it takes lots of man<br>hours to do um to actually discover<br>whether treatments work or<br>not even with the systematic review we<br>still suffer disconnection between<br>research trials looking at medicines and<br>actually improving our well-being and<br>I'm just going to introduce One More<br>Concept that I think is important to<br>this<br>story we are increasingly as a research<br>Community or as a as a community we're<br>increasingly measuring markers of<br>disease rather than the disease<br>themselves and as someone who's read<br>hundreds and thousands of Trials what<br>I've read is that in the 70s and 80s we<br>tended to look at whether treatments<br>actually had an effect on the way a<br>person<br>felt but the trend has become that we've<br>started to actually measure markers of<br>disease in place of measuring the way<br>people feel so here is what I mean we<br>have a disease and that disease has a<br>variable impact on the way someone feels<br>or the way they function or the way they<br>survive and in between that we've got a<br>marker of that disease so say we've got<br>osteoporosis we can measure how dense<br>the bone is or we have hypertension we<br>can measure the blood pressure so the<br>marker is the blood pressure<br>hypertension would lead to poor survival<br>but the blood pressure is the marker of<br>the disease cancer there's a lot of<br>biomarkers that we use to detect where<br>the cancer actually is present and<br>responses to<br>treatment and what we've done is very<br>it's a great idea is that we then<br>introduce medicines that then try and<br>change that marker so we put medicines<br>into trials to try and see if they<br>change the marker and what we've<br>forgotten is actually to test whether<br>changing that marker actually translates<br>into something that we feel or<br>function so for example<br>osteoporosis we've got the bone mineral<br>density scan which tells us the density<br>of someone's bones we have a potential<br>treatment which is vitamin D ultimately<br>the treatment is trying to protect<br>prevent fracture but many of the trials<br>measure bone mineral density as a way of<br>measuring whether treatments work so<br>we've kind of forgotten about the<br>fracture bit and we've started to focus<br>on the bone density scan bit and when<br>I've looked at trials in people who've<br>had a kidney transplant I've discovered<br>that most of the trials stop at the bone<br>density and never measure fracture<br>and that hap that's happened time and<br>time again one more example is diabetes<br>and kidney disease we try and lower<br>blood pressure because we know that that<br>probably helps improve survival but our<br>trials have stopped measuring survival<br>consistent consistently and generally<br>focused on the effect of treatment on<br>blood<br>pressure and my latest work has shown<br>that despite nearly 200 trials inv<br>involving four 45,000 people there's<br>actually no evidence that blood pressure<br>treatments improve survival with people<br>on with diabetes and kidney disease this<br>is right here and now so we're still<br>getting stuck on measuring these these<br>intermediary markers which tell us a lot<br>but we actually<br>haven't included in our trials the<br>effect of treatment on the way people<br>feel and survive and this is a big<br>problem because this is an enormous<br>amount of effort this is billions of<br>dollars of work and we're still not<br>really finding the answers that we<br>need so how can we respond I'm going to<br>get a little bit more upbeat here what<br>I'm going to argue is that we actually<br>need to get even more digitally savvy<br>than James Lind all those years ago we<br>need to get even more clever at<br>combining the information we have in<br>technological ways and there's just an<br>amazing amount of work happening around<br>the world actually doing that I'm going<br>to show you a simple example so imagine<br>these dots are individual<br>trials at the moment all we can do or<br>all we have been able to do in<br>systematic review is say these trials<br>mean that one treatment is better than<br>another and what we now are doing is<br>using instead of standard ways of<br>combining we're actually using network<br>analysis so we're plugging all these<br>trials into a network of electronic<br>information and as each trial comes<br>along we're plugging it into this<br>electronic Network we're then building<br>very complicated statistical models that<br>I don't even begin to understand to<br>allow us to drill down into that Network<br>and discover whether any of the<br>treatments available for a particular<br>disease are effective and this is called<br>Network metanalysis and it's coming to a<br>journal near you soon because it's<br>incredibly<br>powerful this is a very good modern<br>example a group in grease looked at all<br>the antis psychotic treatments available<br>for<br>schizophrenia so you can imagine a<br>clinician and a patient having a<br>discussion about that many treatments<br>and what these researchers managed to do<br>was to plug those treatments into a<br>single Network and look at what they did<br>compared with each other they were<br>literally able to make connections<br>between all those drugs and what they<br>were then able to do with that<br>information which is just profound is<br>they were able to rank them from the<br>best very best treatment and this was<br>measuring symptoms to the very worst so<br>they were able to tell their patients<br>this is clearly the best of all these<br>treatments and actually this hasn't been<br>possible until the last 5 years and this<br>is highly novel and highly highly<br>exciting and you can imagine that there<br>are so many diseases out there where<br>there are you know tens of treatments<br>and this is an opportunity for us to be<br>able to understand all the treatments<br>that are available without even having<br>to do a single new randomized trial<br>because this is done with all the<br>information that's already<br>there we need to explore our patient<br>experiences and much greater detail move<br>away from the markers which are<br>incredibly important but actually<br>understand what our patients are<br>experiencing because that allows us to<br>create health care that actually is<br>addressing those issues so I did a<br>review of in in people who have kidney<br>disease we suggest quite close dietary<br>management and this little quote from a<br>study that I did the patient was saying<br>I always tell the dietitians that the<br>dietary restrictions would actually make<br>people starve there are so many foods<br>that I should eat just a little if I did<br>as instructed by the dieticians I would<br>die from starving so this is a patient<br>saying you're telling me about a<br>treatment for my kidney disease and it's<br>making me feel like this and we need to<br>know this so that when we plan research<br>and plan um new treatments for<br>conditions that we understand what the<br>the what the treatments we're already<br>using are how they're having an impact<br>on<br>people we actually now need to and this<br>is a global movement involve patients<br>and clinicians in priority res setting<br>for research so traditionally patients<br>have been the participants well actually<br>what's happening now is patients and<br>their carers or their families and<br>clinicians are joining together in<br>collaboration to actually decide which<br>research questions are the most<br>important up until now it's been people<br>in universities or in Industry deciding<br>which are the most important medicine<br>questions we need to answer but you'll<br>be pleased to know that the tide is<br>turning and James Lind who is the author<br>of that wonderful systematic review has<br>had the James Lind Alliance named for<br>him and the James Lind Alliance is a<br>group that has the kind of<br>infrastructure to bring patients and<br>families and clinicians together to<br>collaborate on what are the most<br>important research uncertainties in<br>their<br>field and so this is an example from the<br>top 10 research uncertainties brought<br>about by the James Lind Alliance for um<br>local prostate cancer and so the top<br>research SE Arch uncertainty brought<br>about by patients and clinicians is how<br>can overt treatment of cancer be<br>prevented which I think's really<br>interesting that they find that that's<br>the top um treatment uncertainty and at<br>the bottom are there any dietary<br>measures that can prevent prostate<br>cancer or slow its progression so these<br>are research questions that are coming<br>out from the people who are treating and<br>experiencing the disease and we've done<br>something very similar well we're<br>working through something very similar<br>in Sydney with kidney disease we've<br>talked to a a huge group of clinicians<br>and patients about research priorities<br>and kidney disease the top uh research<br>uncertainty for that group is how<br>effective are lifestyle programs for<br>preventing the deterioration of kidney<br>function in patients who have early<br>kidney disease that's the top research<br>uncertainty that's how many randomized<br>trials we have to answer that question<br>so we've got a huge mismatch between<br>what research we're doing and actually<br>What patients and<br>clinicians um consider their most<br>important<br>priorities we then need to move on from<br>that and actually require trials to<br>measure the outcomes that matter to the<br>so instead of measuring markers which<br>are incredibly important we also need<br>need to measure things so this is an<br>example of live births per every um inv<br>vitro fertilization so instead of<br>measuring a hormonal marker we're<br>measuring something that we think is<br>important such as live births and here's<br>some really clear examples of potential<br>end points and trials that we're not<br>measuring properly at the moment so<br>getting back to work returning to full<br>physical activity delays and anxiety and<br>treatment the risks of infection loss of<br>Mobility these are all incredibly<br>important things we're not measuring<br>currently and clinical trials and then<br>finally we actually need to make<br>research much more normal it's not<br>something special done in that building<br>over there it's done in the hospital<br>every single day so we need to embed<br>Clinical Research in our daily clinical<br>practice so that when I come to hospital<br>and there's a research um program going<br>on as a patient I can then have the<br>opportunity of seamlessly joining a<br>research trial that needs huge amount of<br>Information Technology support it needs<br>normalization of research within Health<br>in the healthcare culture but I think<br>it's really important so we need need to<br>measure and evaluate our clinical<br>practice much more routinely we need to<br>use patient centered performance<br>indicators because at the moment in my<br>field we use all sorts of strange<br>markers to measure performance when we<br>don't actually measure the things that<br>our patients tell us are important to<br>them and we need to embed these<br>randomized trials into just daily Health<br>Care um and use information technology<br>to do really large trials across large<br>numbers of sites to be able to do the<br>large trials that tell us where the<br>treatments<br>work so that the<br>research learning where the medicines<br>Works actually includes Health Systems<br>it includes big data so that we can<br>understand that information it includes<br>funders of course because we need money<br>but it also includes people who are<br>experiencing the disease and the<br>communities so this is almost my last<br>slide what I might imagine<br>um if I was to enter a health care<br>practice in the future would be that<br>that health care practice would be<br>familiar and understand systematic<br>review or at least understand its<br>importance and what it means to learn<br>about treatments and whether they work<br>or not I would hope that they would then<br>offer me effective treatment or priority<br>treatments within large randomized trial<br>so either they would know that a<br>treatment was effective or there would<br>be an important treatment uncertain and<br>I would be able to be involved in a<br>large randomized trial the the health<br>center would know which outcomes of<br>treatment I would value most highly or<br>someone like me would value most highly<br>and that that Health Care System<br>actually measures those outcomes so<br>doesn't measure something odd or some<br>strange bi Market but measures those<br>outcomes that that health system is then<br>linked to a strong peer Network and good<br>information technology so that those<br>outcomes can be measured<br>and then there is a review to see<br>whether those priority outcomes are even<br>achieved within trials or within<br>standard Healthcare practice that that<br>Health System would then adjust practice<br>learning from from those measurements<br>and then the full cycle so that that<br>that health research becomes normal it's<br>done on a very large scale it's<br>facilitated by good information<br>technology and it's constantly reiter<br>ative so that we're constantly aware of<br>whether treatments are working for us or<br>not and that's all I have to<br>we a couple of comments first one is<br>relates to the the question of of<br>this met analysis talking about we also<br>need to<br>go area but it's still dependent it's<br>still sort of observational depend on<br>the model that we use do met analysis<br>don't we need to go a step further back<br>and make sure that our trials are<br>designed together to go together rather<br>than pull together afterwards that's an<br>absolutely wonderful point and that's<br>actually what's starting to happen we we<br>need to make sure that trials are all<br>measuring the things that matter to us<br>and therefore they're much more easily<br>combinable what you're saying is even<br>from the get-go before a trial is<br>designed we're thinking how it's going<br>to plug into our network of information<br>and that's absolutely essential so the<br>collaborative metanalysis where you're<br>designing the study with the rest of the<br>information in mind that's not<br>necessarily meaning you're doing the<br>same study over and over and over it<br>just means that studies are similar<br>enough that you can combine them and<br>increase the power of your observations<br>y so excellent point<br>wonder yes can be over still be over by<br>System you yeah yeah<br>still that's that's a great question um<br>the group I work with is the ccken renal<br>group in Sydney and it's filled with<br>extraordinary women who in the last hour<br>of their day physically hunt through<br>conference proceedings and journals to<br>find trials that might otherwise not be<br>indexed properly so we go hunting but we<br>still don't overcome the filing draw<br>problem where trials are just tucked<br>away or data is tucked away we have<br>statistical methods to show that trials<br>are missing and we can overcome that<br>using statistical methods but we still<br>have a<br>tendency for um trials to overemphasize<br>positivity and the the reverse of the<br>coin is equally important is that trials<br>tend to measure whether drugs work but<br>actually if you notice in my<br>introduction we actually often don't<br>measure whether they're safe because<br>people running trials actually aren't as<br>interested in adverse effects as they<br>are on whether a drug works and that's a<br>very difficult problem to overcome and<br>trials don't actually overcome that we<br>then need to kind of reverse and<br>backtrack and go to very very large<br>observational data sets to look at um<br>Adverse Events and that's how many of<br>the um drug Adverse Events were actually<br>discovered when we actually went back to<br>way absolutely<br>yes that's a great point it doesn't so<br>so these days if you're going to do a<br>trial and you're going to get it<br>published you have to report before you<br>submit it for publication to a large<br>registry to say who you've included in<br>the trial what treatment you've used<br>some very very basic details and you're<br>given a unique identifying number and<br>that came in in<br>2006 as a meta analyst I've discovered<br>that that doesn't happen very as often<br>as we would like so even though it's<br>designed to be a universal thing that<br>every trial publish needs to do do it<br>about only about 50% of Trials are being<br>registered at the moment but I would<br>have to say that there's been a sharp<br>uptick in the last year or two which has<br>been really helpful but if a person<br>doesn't ever try and publish their trial<br>then that trial won't appear anywhere<br>it's kind of invisible and trial<br>yeah<br>so those lines that's very observant<br>those lines were trials where treatment<br>were directly compared within a trial so<br>if treatment a and treatment B were<br>compared within a single trial there<br>would be a line drawn between treatment<br>a and treatment B if treatment a and<br>treatment C were compared in a trial<br>then A and C would get a line but maybe<br>there was no B versus C trial so that<br>wouldn't get a line but using statistics<br>you can actually understand whether B or<br>C are better than each other even though<br>the trial has never been done and so<br>that's the power of network analysis and<br>allow and that's what allows you to rank<br>the drugs from you know really great to<br>poor that's a really good question we<br>are we absolutely require the drug<br>industry for conducting most of that<br>there's a huge amount of money that goes<br>into drug development and it's<br>absolutely essential that that drug<br>development is funded by the industry<br>because it's you know billions of<br>dollars what we know is that drug<br>company funded trials tend to be more<br>positive than non-drug company trials by<br>a small margin it's not a huge margin<br>what we also know is that drug company<br>trials tend to be better quality than<br>non-drug company trials as a rule so<br>actually very high quality trials what<br>we also know is that drug companies tend<br>to compare their drugs favorably with<br>medicines or drug Alternatives or<br>treatment Alternatives that might show<br>their drug and to be in a better light<br>so there's a whole bunch of issues with<br>with Drug Company trials that separate<br>them from say what we call investigator<br>lead trials what we do in meta anal Anis<br>is we actually look at the quality of<br>the information coming back to us from<br>each trial using a standard set of<br>criteria and we use that to actually<br>tell the reader about the confidence<br>that we have in the results of our<br>analysis so we can say there were 80<br>trials but many of them had methods that<br>make us less confident in their results<br>so therefore even though this drug<br>appears to work we're not that confident<br>about this result so that's how you can<br>adjust for differences between trials<br>and differences between methods within<br>trials<br>yeah some sh that people react to drug<br>so<br>how that's right it's a really good<br>question so what metaanalysis allows us<br>if we've got enough information it<br>allows us to tell us when the drug works<br>for whom and so we're able actually to<br>understand whether the drug has<br>different effects in different people<br>which is incredibly powerful because in<br>single Tri we often don't know that so<br>to give you an example one of my recent<br>um pieces of work we use um statins<br>which are lipid lowering medications to<br>protect people against cardiovascular<br>disease there are 88 trials and some of<br>them are in people who have mild forms<br>of kidney disease and some of them are<br>in people who have very severe forms of<br>kidney<br>disease and the convention was that the<br>Statin were equally good for everyone<br>and actually what metaanalysis did was<br>it gave us enough power in the analyses<br>to actually show that people had<br>different responses to treatment based<br>on the severity of kidney disease so<br>that people who had mild forms of kidney<br>disease got a huge amount of benefit out<br>of<br>stattin whereas those who were had<br>severe kidney disease and were treated<br>with dialysis got only a very very small<br>benefit and that was a completely new<br>piece of information because we were<br>able to look at different populations<br>within a huge amount of information we<br>were able to say that and that's<br>actually been incredibly helpful and<br>that's actually gone into Global<br>guidelines in terms of who might benefit<br>from stattin therapy and who doesn't so<br>metanalysis actually gives us even more<br>power to understand when treatments work<br>for particular people it's not always<br>it's not it's not a perfect science by<br>yeah<br>sent to<br>meas<br>always being done around how you<br>measure the patient feeling of<br>wellbeing<br>because absolutely and how do you<br>actually quantify that to<br>make<br>rather<br>than yeah that's a great question so we<br>have you know quality of life scales<br>which measure how someone feels along a<br>kind of a visual an you know some sort<br>of scale and I would suggest that that's<br>kind of a that's a difficult thing to<br>use and almost runs the risk of the<br>causing the same problems as as the<br>markets themselves so that's where this<br>effort to actually ask ask people what<br>kinds of outcomes they value because a<br>health quality of life score of<br>3.8 doesn't mean much to me and it<br>probably doesn't mean much to the<br>average person in a trial whereas much<br>more hard and fast outcomes like time<br>taken to return to work ability to<br>return to full function or um<br>maintenance of a of Full Employment or<br>you know those sorts of things we we're<br>very early in the science of<br>understanding actually what matters to<br>people in diseases and actually what we<br>should be<br>modifying so and that's where my group<br>and Sydney are working on with people<br>with chronic kidney disease to actually<br>find out if you have this particular<br>disease process what is it that's<br>important to you that you want to<br>maintain through treatment is it to<br>maintain days out of Hospital is it to<br>maintain time with your family is it to<br>keep a full-time job I think we need to<br>be much more concrete about our outcomes<br>and I think I don't begin to know what<br>those outcomes are but someone who's<br>experiencing the condition does and we<br>need to work very hard to find out what<br>those outcomes actually are so then we<br>can then demand much like the trial<br>registration we can demand that trials<br>actually measure those outcomes<br>otherwise they won't get published<br>because that's the only only way you can<br>behave<br>treat yeah yeah do does<br>that well exactly I think I mean long we<br>live in a globe of chronic disease and<br>multi multiple disease as well so that<br>people don't only just have one<br>condition and I think as I say we're at<br>early days I don't even begin to<br>conceptualize how we deal with<br>preventive<br>treatment<br>um uh other than creating the same sort<br>of structures about asking people who<br>have say h tension or high blood<br>pressure or high cholesterol what is it<br>about treatment that they hope and<br>basically we just have to do the big<br>trials that prove those outcomes so if<br>it's ultimately survival then we need to<br>do those big trials and that's where<br>facilitating trials within standard<br>healthc care allows us to do those big<br>trials much more<br>easily I'm aware we're just pass 8:00<br>and we try and finish on time so I would<br>ask you all to thank uh associate<br>professor Palmer for her speech I'm sure<br>she's happy if you got a burning<br>question to come down and ask her at the<br>you<br>that</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
