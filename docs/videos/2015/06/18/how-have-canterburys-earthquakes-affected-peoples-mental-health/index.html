impact of the Canterbury earthquakes.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening ladies and gentlemen<br>for people who don't know my name is<br>Peter Joyce I'm Dean University of Otago<br>Christchurch and it's my pleasure to<br>cheer these public lectures tonight is<br>the final in our series for this late<br>summer and autumn and it's my pleasure<br>to introduce associate professor<br>Caroline bill Caroline did her medical<br>degree at Oxford University in the UK<br>did a research degree and a lot of her<br>training in psychiatry at Bristol with<br>David Nutt whose name may be known to<br>some people because he's a controversial<br>figure around the world um but we were<br>fortunate that Caroline chose to come to<br>Christ Church in 2001 the last five<br>years she's been seconded from the<br>medical school to the DHB to head the<br>DHB mental health response to the<br>effects of the earthquake and tonight<br>Caroline's going to talk about shaky<br>times the impact of earthquakes on our<br>well-being Caroline thank you ah thank<br>you Peter and thank you all for coming<br>out and this evening pleasure to be here<br>so um as Peter said what I'm going to<br>talk about is really what we've seen<br>what we've all been through over these<br>last four and a half years um and i'm<br>going to divide the talk into sort of<br>different sections so first of all<br>talking about what happened which i know<br>we know but actually when you look at<br>the pictures again it's quite a reminder<br>and and I think as I'm going to talk<br>about the neuroscience it emphasizes<br>actually how we remember things like<br>this or a bit different and then I'm<br>going to talk about how people and very<br>briefly how animals as well have reacted<br>and then talk about how understanding<br>some of the neurobiology and<br>neuroscience can help us explain some of<br>the things we've been through and also<br>think about things that might help and<br>then I'm going to conclude with what has<br>been hell<br>for both for people with very severe<br>problems and really for us all which is<br>very much a work in progress so first<br>what happened this is of course the<br>picture of the 22nd in February<br>earthquake and it's weird when I look at<br>that picture and it feels at the same<br>time boasts like yesterday and a<br>lifetime away and you've got both those<br>things going on in your head and that's<br>not normally how we remember things but<br>then what obviously we had further<br>earthquakes and we had those<br>interminable aftershocks that were<br>incredibly frequent and just seemed to<br>happen just when you didn't want them at<br>night and had a really big effect on us<br>and then there's been what has been<br>termed now the secondary effect that<br>everything else that has happened as a<br>result of the earthquakes and for many<br>people they've been a lot bigger than<br>the earthquakes themselves and then the<br>phase the other phase is about<br>rebuilding and moving on and the<br>challenges with that and there are<br>becoming new challenges with that<br>currently particularly people with<br>unsettled claims and there's a big<br>difference in how that group are<br>functioning compared to the rest of the<br>population repair problems coming up now<br>not just not having had repairs but<br>people who've had repairs and then<br>having to battle with eq c or insurers<br>all over again and then people who've<br>had ongoing issues with health and<br>disability or low income and really<br>struggling further with that so this<br>again is reminding us of some things<br>that are pretty horrible that dreadful<br>liquefaction and that this this poignant<br>lee and whenever I talk to insurers they<br>talk about houses and I talk about homes<br>because it's so different you know where<br>you're living and how that is affected<br>is not just a number it's a place where<br>you brought up your family where all<br>your memories are<br>and when people's homes are damaged they<br>have X really powerful right and this is<br>just a depiction of the aftershocks so<br>this is kind of that so many of them we<br>can hardly see them but if you think<br>about the second line down this is over<br>a week it was a pretty typical week and<br>we're getting a lot of aftershocks<br>several a day now a lot of them we<br>wouldn't really feel if labor over for<br>they weren't worth looking up from your<br>desk from but that's a lot of things<br>that we're experiencing for a very long<br>time so turning now to what did all that<br>do to us and how did we respond well<br>again I think your structured way of<br>thinking about this is to break it down<br>into different elements so first of all<br>I'm going to talk about what are the<br>normal reactions to very frightening<br>potentially life-threatening events<br>which the earthquakes were for many<br>people then I'm going to talk about how<br>our bodies responded to having those<br>thousands of aftershocks and that we all<br>experienced then thinking how we respond<br>to having multiple stressful things we<br>have to deal with on top of normal life<br>which I don't remember being very stress<br>free before the earthquake so you've got<br>this whole nother layer of difficulties<br>on top of that but also reminding us<br>that actually what's happened hasn't all<br>been negative so I'm not being<br>pollyannaish about this but a lot of<br>people talk about good things they that<br>have happened and things they've learned<br>from the earthquakes so first of all<br>reactions to very frightening sudden<br>things that happen to us there was an<br>overwhelming feeling of fear and anxiety<br>isn't the right word to capture it it<br>was much more kind of primitive than<br>that it was really you could almost feel<br>it in your body we were getting<br>triggered really easily buy things so<br>not only aftershock<br>but anything that sounded like an<br>aftershock coming that rumbling sound or<br>most particularly things that made the<br>ground shake so a truck going by or the<br>airport was dreadful I mean you know<br>with with planes landing and I was<br>convinced you know we may as well all<br>have walked around with I'm from<br>Christchurch stamped on our heads<br>because when a bus went by we'd all be<br>doing this and you didn't realize how<br>unusual it was unless you went to<br>somewhere else like you went to Dunedin<br>I we went to Wellington and you're doing<br>this and everyone's looking at you<br>saying what are you doing and you can't<br>stop it it was a really primitive<br>reaction we all had and we were all<br>being pretty wary of multi-storey car<br>park shopping malls not very keen to go<br>into the city even if we could so really<br>avoiding things that we felt felt were a<br>threat very anxious about separating<br>being separated from family and kind of<br>having your cell phone and car keys with<br>you all times was kind of absolutely<br>what you need forget everything else but<br>have those worrying a lot about what<br>could have happened what might happen my<br>head constantly kind of going round on<br>on those kind of loops and almost<br>universal sleep disturbance so not only<br>because the aftershocks always seemed to<br>happen just when you got off to sleep<br>but because we're all pretty alert to<br>being able to respond very quickly a lot<br>of children moved into the parents bed<br>again and it took ages for them to get<br>back out again and that came bought its<br>own problems and to a degree going over<br>the things that we've seen and<br>remembered from that time things that<br>are called re experiencing symptoms they<br>were pretty Universal not absolutely but<br>a lot of people had some of those then<br>the reactions to the aftershock so this<br>is our body's responding to constantly<br>being shocked and made to be on alert by<br>the ground shaking and as I've mentioned<br>one of the big things with this<br>exaggerated startle response this kind<br>of doing that suddenly when the ground<br>would move<br>or you'd hear a loud noise constantly<br>being hyper vigilant for things<br>concentration difficulties being almost<br>universal I think people talked about<br>being an earthquake brain and that's<br>frequently described in other disasters<br>as well and that's gone on for a long<br>time for a lot of people well I've got<br>it I know a lot of people have got it um<br>sleep difficulties and fatigue and the<br>fatigue wasn't just related to<br>difficulty sleeping when your body is<br>living with that level of arousal it<br>gets really physically exhausted and<br>they've been lots of complaints of that<br>and people being very irritable and<br>easily roused to anger and probably<br>anger came a bit later after several<br>months but it was becoming a real<br>problem in the community not just<br>because of the injustice 'as that were<br>happening but actually people were on a<br>very tight wire okay then the secondary<br>stressors I mean lots of people have had<br>lots of these the really big ones were<br>the battles with insurers the battles<br>we're getting em houses repaired and<br>difficulties with renting just<br>everything was for many people extremely<br>difficult some people had a smooth ride<br>but they were the minority families<br>being very disrupted children with<br>schools sleep disruption elderly<br>relatives moving in people moving away<br>there was a lot of change much more than<br>we usually experience and the changes to<br>the city and the whole landscape<br>everything you drive past walk past is<br>changed but it's also pretty broken and<br>seeing that all the time is quite<br>demoralizing and I think we must have<br>all the road cones in the southern<br>hemisphere because you know that I mean<br>the roads are just a complete nightmare<br>and the battling to find a route round<br>that is forever changing makes driving<br>really quite hard work so it's another<br>drain on our resources<br>and then being limited social resources<br>and the adolescents and kids talked<br>about this a lot and there's not much to<br>do here and that's a problem and then<br>workplace changes so lots of relocation<br>shared spaces doing things differently<br>so that is an awful lot of things that<br>people are juggling and that's very<br>stressful so these are themes that<br>people talked about they they talked<br>about feeling they were being repeatedly<br>hit or punctured on all fronts you know<br>at home at work just even getting to<br>work with difficult and that being<br>really exhausting people came to their<br>GP saying there must be something wrong<br>with me I'm just so tired all the time I<br>can't recover from it people having<br>difficulty concentrating and that being<br>a bit of a double whammy because<br>actually they were needing to make<br>really complex decisions about really<br>big things their homes their financial<br>futures and really having difficulty<br>concentrating that's really difficult to<br>do people describe filling overwhelmed<br>by trying to deal with it all and juggle<br>it all and because of that almost being<br>paralyzed by being able to make any<br>decisions it was all just too big and<br>too much lots of themes about loss of<br>control and people didn't really mean<br>that in relation to the ground moving<br>that obviously we can't control that but<br>more that we couldn't negotiate a way<br>through processes that nothing we did<br>seem to be like it was before normally<br>you could make a case you could write a<br>letter you could write an email could<br>speak to someone on the phone and you<br>could sort it not in this world anymore<br>and people find that really really<br>difficult and disempowering and I've<br>talked about feeling generally lower<br>tolerance for anything you know the<br>people would snap really easily really<br>easily particularly in the workplace and<br>but depressing though all that is not<br>everything about me earthquakes has been<br>negative and they've been a lot of<br>people who have reported that despite<br>all that and often that they've had real<br>struggles they've seen positive things<br>that have come from it and they've been<br>able to hold both at the same time which<br>is quite interesting really so people<br>describe feeling closer to family and<br>friends that really realizing how<br>important they are and valuing that time<br>much more than they did before generally<br>feeling less materialistic that actually<br>there's not so much point in just<br>working for things because things get<br>broken but actually that's not really<br>what you value it is your family and<br>your friendships and relationships and<br>really really a ting what's important in<br>your life and not just carrying on<br>carrying on just really thinking about<br>what's important some people describe<br>that they feel they've become a stronger<br>person because of it that they've learnt<br>about themselves because of the<br>earthquakes and see that in a positive<br>light and children have been more mature<br>and responsible mine heaven but some<br>people have received that I think that's<br>again learning from experiences that<br>actually they've had to deal with an<br>awful lot and mainly they have so this<br>figure has been shown an awful lot and<br>and what it depicts it's really a<br>summary of what previous disasters have<br>told us about the phases of recovery so<br>it's not saying that all of us go<br>exactly through this but it's a kind of<br>summary of the processes that most<br>people follow but the timeline is very<br>variable for different people so in some<br>disasters like a flood they might know<br>it's coming they can't do anything about<br>it but they might be able to prepare so<br>they have a pre disaster time obviously<br>we didn't have that and then<br>the disaster hits for us of course that<br>was the earthquakes and then there's<br>this heroic phase which is not just<br>about the amazing rescue work and people<br>who did physically heroic things but it<br>really describes most people's reactions<br>to what they did most people i remember<br>my card are talking about what who's the<br>professor of emergency medicine here he<br>said what i saw on that day was most<br>people doing amazing things and that is<br>what they did they really helped pretty<br>much everyone in some aspect often<br>people so put that down what they did<br>but just going up to someone else and<br>saying are you all right that she has a<br>huge impact on people and then there's<br>the honeymoon phase which is this sense<br>of amazing community cohesion when you<br>really did feel that you could go up to<br>anyone and ask anything of them and they<br>would help you and it was almost<br>palpable in the streets and that<br>actually felt like life was better than<br>it was before because life's not<br>normally like that were in our own<br>little silos often so that was a really<br>good feeling and then there's this phase<br>which is the sort of disillusionment and<br>gradually rebuilding when really the<br>enormity of the scale of what has to<br>happen really starts hitting in and then<br>people gradually come out of this and<br>it's not a straight line it's an<br>up-and-down line and different things<br>trigger things for different people and<br>make it more difficult and obviously the<br>timeline of that is very different if<br>you've your house hasn't been damaged<br>and your work hasn't been affected and<br>no one you know has been affected<br>obviously that phase for you is going to<br>happen much more quickly for most be so<br>though people like that if you've lost<br>your house a family member's been<br>injured people have left left town<br>because of it your life has changed<br>dramatically it's more likely that<br>that's going to take longer<br>so it's a sort of helpful guide but it<br>doesn't mean we're you couldn't say you<br>know we're April the first and we at<br>this is where Christchurch's which is<br>what how politicians want us to answer a<br>question like that but that's impossible<br>to answer it like that now the one other<br>point I wanted to highlight was this<br>line here is purposely drawn higher like<br>at a better level of functioning than<br>this pre-disaster line and what that is<br>reflecting is this concept of<br>post-traumatic growth that people or<br>communities that have really struggled<br>or gone through adversity do at some<br>point reach a phase where they are in a<br>better space than they were before<br>reflecting some of those positive<br>outcomes that I talked about on the<br>earlier slide so that doesn't mean that<br>for guarantee but it means that does<br>tend to happen ok so we also looked a<br>lot really early on trying to find a<br>kind of road map to guide us to think<br>what's going to happen you know what can<br>we expect to see and so with there's<br>quite a lot of literature on disasters<br>and it's a whole field of medicine that<br>I hadn't known about before but there<br>are a lot of disasters in the world and<br>there are a lot of literature out there<br>telling us how communities have<br>responded so the very important thing<br>and I think we all know it now is that<br>the disaster itself is just the start of<br>a really complex series of events and I<br>know when I hear about something on the<br>news now like like vanuatu you think oh<br>my goodness you know it's gone off the<br>news now but how long that is going to<br>take to recover and how people's lives<br>have been so dramatically changed so<br>it's not a one-off thing a disaster it's<br>just the start of the process the<br>literature also tells us that the<br>exposure gradient is really important so<br>what that means is and again it sounds<br>quite obvious is that the more exposed<br>you are the<br>more you've lost the more likely you are<br>to have difficulties and also when you<br>think about exposure you have to think<br>not just about what happened in the<br>earthquake but what happened afterwards<br>you know whether you lost your house<br>whether you lost your business whether<br>someone you knew was injured it's not<br>another important factor is when you ask<br>people how they are because if you ask<br>someone a few weeks after going through<br>at the earthquakes they will have a lot<br>of symptoms because they're completely<br>normal whereas if you ask people the<br>same questions two years after an event<br>the rates of those reporting<br>difficulties will be much much less so<br>again you have to look at when do you<br>ask the questions it also depends what<br>you measure but really all the<br>literature says that is that distress<br>immediately is extremely common those<br>symptoms I talked about it earlier not<br>sleeping being very jumpy being very on<br>edge they're very very common in most<br>people immediately after a disaster how<br>long they last depends whether it's a<br>one-off event or whether like us you had<br>their aftershocks and further<br>earthquakes so distress immediately is<br>extremely common the other thing it<br>tells us is that modest pat the majority<br>of people vastly the majority do not<br>have ongoing mental health difficulties<br>after a disaster even those who've been<br>really really highly exposed which is<br>quite remarkable when you think what<br>people have just juggling with in going<br>through but having said that there are a<br>significant minority who do develop<br>problems and those are things like<br>post-traumatic stress disorder which I'm<br>going to talk about a bit later but<br>other things as well like depression and<br>other anxiety disorders<br>but the the literature also says but<br>there's lots of confounding things like<br>a lot of these studies don't have a<br>measure of what difficulties were in the<br>community before the earthquake or the<br>disaster happens you can't actually<br>directly compare it often lots of people<br>relate everything to the difficulty<br>they've had so they put everything down<br>to the earthquake so that might be a<br>bias as well so this is a summary of<br>what the literature tells us most<br>people's outcomes are the green and the<br>blue line so they have some difficulties<br>but they rapidly if it's only a single<br>event disaster come back to normal or<br>they have some short-lived difficulties<br>with sleep concentration anxiety but<br>they improve and so the green and the<br>blue lines represent about 80% of what<br>people eighty percent of people do that<br>but a significant number have<br>difficulties from when the disaster<br>happened and continue to have them if<br>they're untreated and a small proportion<br>have difficulties where they were sort<br>of struggling and then something happens<br>and they have really bad difficulties so<br>we have to be able to hold both things<br>in our head that most people are okay<br>eventually but there are a small group<br>but it's a significant number of people<br>who are going to have ongoing<br>difficulties so I want to talk a little<br>bit about resilience and I hate that<br>word probably just too just less than I<br>hate the new normal but you know we<br>haven't got a better word for resilience<br>yet and it developed from engineering<br>terms and it means it's not doesn't mean<br>that you don't you're absolutely fine<br>but what it means is you can adapt to<br>what you've been through and manage to<br>function some people say they add the<br>words thrive on the end of that I think<br>that's just way too positive I think<br>it's good enough to get through a bad<br>event and be coping and<br>adapted to that what we also know is we<br>used to think that really bad things<br>were not that common but actually about<br>sixty percent of people have experienced<br>a really traumatic event in their lives<br>as an awful lot of people so bad things<br>can happen and they do happen and<br>they're actually much more common than<br>we thought they were a lot of the work<br>on resilience has actually come from<br>childhood follow-up studies where<br>they've looked at children who've been<br>through really really adverse<br>experiences but have grown up fine and<br>people think how could they you know<br>they've had such a adverse experience<br>throughout their early development but<br>they have turned out you're right and<br>what that's been described as is<br>ordinary magic that actually kids<br>somehow innately despite huge adversity<br>can cope not all of them but they can so<br>what do we know predicts resilience I've<br>broken this down into things that happen<br>before a bad thing happens before a<br>traumatic event things that happen at<br>the time of the event and things that<br>happen after the event so before the<br>event it's better age-wise if you're not<br>very young and there has been some<br>reports about that older people did do<br>worse but more recent research has<br>actually suggested that older people<br>seem to do remarkably well and they<br>describe that as they've learnt a lot<br>through their lives and they've already<br>coped with quite a lot of adversity and<br>they see this as another thing that<br>they've can deal with um gender males do<br>better than women in most of the<br>research whether they have been<br>previously exposed to bad events and<br>this is a interesting debatable area<br>because some people say that being<br>exposed to a trauma before<br>predisposes you to having a bad outcome<br>but actually when you look at that more<br>closely it's being exposed to a<br>traumatic thing in your past and having<br>a bad and having post-traumatic stress<br>disorder predisposes you to having<br>difficulties but actually going through<br>bad things and if you manage them is<br>described as actually a sort of mastery<br>skill that you've learnt you can deal<br>with it and then when another disaster<br>happens actually you're already pre<br>armed and then personality factors this<br>is definitely that definitely evidence<br>so people who are really quite<br>optimistic always beforehand they've got<br>lots of coping skills they don't worry<br>about things I think we all know people<br>like that I've got a ridiculously<br>optimistic husband he's just you know<br>every problem is an opportunity and yeah<br>but he truly does think like that you<br>know and he's not he's not making it up<br>but here the people like that really<br>quite resilient then what happens at the<br>time of the event so we've talked about<br>what you actually experience you know if<br>it's really bad it's going to be more<br>difficult but it's so important as well<br>to realize that what you feel of a time<br>is really important so a lot of the<br>people that we've seen with bad<br>reactions describe that when the<br>earthquake happened they were absolutely<br>convinced they were going to die and<br>they might have been in the same room as<br>someone who experienced physically the<br>same thing their their colleague didn't<br>feel that so your perception of the<br>experience is really really powerful and<br>your reaction at the time so people who<br>have difficulties tend to have hyper<br>aroused feelings they're panicking<br>absolutely terrified or some people<br>describe dissociation where they lose<br>time till that what went through<br>happened at the earthquakes they felt<br>like everything was going on in slow<br>motion is sometimes described themselves<br>being out of their body looking down on<br>themselves I really quite shut down<br>response but either of those things<br>either being very aroused all quite shut<br>down is a risk for not doing so well but<br>after the event this actually has a very<br>big effect size so those things I've<br>talked about a relevant but what happens<br>after the event is also relevant and<br>these are things that we can do stuff<br>about actually so people who have good<br>support tend to do better people who are<br>well connected tend to do better people<br>obviously have but less bad things<br>happen and do better but we can do<br>something about that if we can<br>pressurize politicians to make fewer bad<br>things happen in terms of insurance<br>rebuilding and then coping styles have<br>been described as not being you do well<br>if you're more optimistic if you keep<br>focused on current goals and don't get<br>consumed by the concerns of the<br>earthquakes and you have your home of<br>things and very importantly people carry<br>on enjoying the things they used to do<br>before whereas people who don't do so<br>well those drop off so we know all that<br>from the literature and we also know as<br>I've talked about that a minority of<br>people do get mental health problems so<br>these this is something called<br>post-traumatic stress disorder which is<br>when people who have experienced a<br>really life-threatening event have<br>reacts perience in symptoms from that<br>they constantly go over it they have<br>nightmares about it they have flashbacks<br>about it where they're reliving it<br>almost in real time going through it<br>again they're terrified of further<br>earthquakes they avoid places because<br>they're scared of earthquakes they're<br>not sleeping they can't concentrate<br>their incredibly jumpy credibly hyper<br>aroused they're really terrified and<br>what we found with the people who've<br>come with those difficulties that almost<br>universally they felt they were going to<br>die at the time of the earthquakes<br>whether or not<br>what they went through was worse than<br>anyone else what mattered was their<br>perception of it and we've also seen a<br>group of people who were rescue workers<br>demolition workers worked with the<br>ambulance rescuing people and those<br>experiences constantly go through their<br>mind and then we've had people who've<br>had previous post traumatic stress<br>disorder from some other terrible thing<br>that's happened to them and for them<br>every time there was an aftershock or an<br>earthquake they'd get a memory or a<br>flashback of their previous trauma but<br>they're not of the earthquakes but their<br>previous time they felt so under threat<br>but also remembering that people don't<br>just get PTSD they also get depression<br>or other anxiety disorders and there's<br>been lots of talk in the press about<br>increased numbers of referrals to mental<br>health services as times gone on so this<br>is very much turning the resilience side<br>of the literature the other way round<br>and we've pretty much covered that so<br>people who've had previous traumatic<br>events or mental health history are more<br>at risk what happens to them at the time<br>of the event and then what happens to<br>them afterwards so that's all about<br>previous disasters now what have we<br>actually seen in Canterbury so we know<br>this because there's been various<br>samples they've done I've been done in<br>the form of surveys sisira have done a<br>survey repeatedly over the last three<br>years there's also been a survey by the<br>all right campaign people may know about<br>there's been various employee surveys<br>we've also looked at patterns of<br>dispensing of medication that you might<br>might expect in with mental health<br>problems and then there's been some<br>cross-sectional research and then a very<br>very strong longitudinal study which has<br>been able to look at people before the<br>earthquakes and after so I'll just fly<br>through that<br>but what I want you to emphasize by<br>these following two slides is that it's<br>almost like politicians or the media<br>want us to say how Christchurch is so on<br>the one hand you get messages that we're<br>all in trouble we're all taking<br>antidepressants we're all taking<br>anxieties and then the other side of the<br>coin is actually we're all great because<br>we've been through this and we've come<br>through this relatively unscathed and<br>we've learned a lot from that now the<br>fact the matter is both are true but<br>they're not the whole story you know and<br>the whole story is more complex than<br>that that some people do need at all<br>having difficulties and some people do<br>feel they've really come through this<br>and learnt a lot from it but there's a<br>wide spectrum in between as well so what<br>have we seen in Christchurch very much<br>like the previous literature we saw very<br>widespread acute reactions to the<br>earthquakes and aftershocks then we saw<br>the effects of the secondary stressors<br>and what we saw again reflecting the<br>previous literature is that the majority<br>of people are functioning but they say<br>they're not great there are words like<br>I'm bone tired I'm running close to<br>empty very employers talk about people<br>having a very narrow focus and a reduced<br>capacity for taking on more work a small<br>minority described themselves as<br>thriving and a significant but bigger<br>minority described themselves as having<br>mental health problems also that the the<br>type of stressors have changed over time<br>so in 2012 most people reported that the<br>aftershocks and the earthquakes with a<br>really big thing in 2013 it was the<br>insurance the rebuild the big decisions<br>people were making and now people talk<br>about the daily grind which I'm sure is<br>a coffee but I don't mean it like that<br>but it's a you know just living with<br>constant damage to the infrastructure<br>everything<br>hard work you're getting to work the<br>roads are difficult the house is<br>difficult the landscapes difficult<br>everything's difficult and people<br>there's becoming groups which I have<br>almost being left behind and having more<br>difficulties so these are now people<br>with unsettled claims you know four<br>years on after the earthquakes people<br>with repair issues either those that<br>have to be done or have already been<br>done people with low income or health<br>disability and what that's really<br>emphasizing to us is that we really have<br>a role in pressurizing politicians and<br>insurance companies to alleviate these<br>stresses as much as they can that is a<br>challenge right now turning to<br>prescriptin prescribing rates of<br>different medications that we might<br>expect to be increased if people were<br>having difficulties with anxiety and<br>depression so we've been able to look at<br>those and compare the DHB to the<br>national levels of prescribing so as a<br>percentage of the national levels of<br>prescribing so these are for sedatives<br>and anxiety X so Ang's oolitic switch<br>prescribed during the daytime for<br>anxiety and sedatives which will be<br>helping people to sleep so what this<br>shows us is that at the time of the<br>februari earthquake there were increased<br>prescribing rates of slip this yellow is<br>the sedatives and the blue is the<br>anxieties but they were very short-lived<br>so people did take medication for<br>anxiety or sleep but not over a<br>prolonged period that's that's good we<br>didn't want everyone to be using<br>medication excessively so that is good<br>but we also found that antidepressants<br>didn't increase so I talked about the<br>mental health problems that people might<br>get are often conditions that will be<br>treated by antidepressants so<br>post-traumatic stress disorder is also<br>to treated by an antidepressant<br>but there's been no increases in<br>antidepressant prescribing this big drop<br>I think is just because people left<br>Christchurch so I wasn't a dramatic cure<br>at the time but they're clearly hasn't<br>now this was a study that Peter was<br>involved in it looked it was a survey of<br>people who are all around 50 at the time<br>of the earthquake and this again showed<br>probably what the other surveys have<br>showed to a degree lower scores on<br>measures of mental health and social<br>functioning more so on mental health<br>than on physical health and although<br>rates of depression were a little higher<br>they weren't significantly higher than<br>comparisons they made they they compared<br>with again I just want something a<br>little bit of time talking about this<br>study so this is a study by David<br>Ferguson's group which is called the<br>Christchurch health and development<br>study and it involves thousand children<br>who'd been followed up since birth and<br>they're now around 35 it's a remarkable<br>study anyway but at the time of the<br>earthquake I think only David Ferguson<br>could have made this happen but of the<br>thousand about 500 were in Christchurch<br>at the time of the earthquake and 500<br>weren't so he had this amazing natural<br>experiment where he could truly compare<br>what exposure to the earthquake did to<br>this group who experienced the<br>earthquake in comparison to the group<br>that didn't and he's got all these<br>measures from how they were before hand<br>before the earthquake happened and very<br>little research has got that kind of<br>measure before and after and one group<br>exposed and one group not exposed so<br>it's a remarkable study and what this<br>found was that as we've heard from the<br>other literature increasing exposure to<br>the earthquakes resulted in an increased<br>rate of mental health<br>saudis so he compared do you look at the<br>different disorders so in people who<br>weren't exposed there weren't in in<br>christchurch the rates of PTSD will one<br>put a one point seven percent in the<br>groups that were highly exposed but only<br>the highly exposed group the rates of<br>PTSD were sig much higher five point two<br>percent and similarly for depression not<br>in christchurch the time of the<br>earthquake and in Christchurch and badly<br>exposed much higher rates so he was able<br>to say really quite conclusively that<br>the high exposure cohort had higher<br>rates of mental disorder than the group<br>weren't that weren't exposed and the<br>increase was due to the rates of<br>post-traumatic stress disorder anxiety<br>depression and smoking smoking went up a<br>lot and from that they could say that<br>there was an eight percent increase in<br>mental health disorders from the<br>earthquakes so it's not massive but is<br>it is a significant number and that's<br>very similar to figures that were talked<br>about right at the beginning that and so<br>Peter gluckman is the government<br>scientific officer said that five<br>percent of people would be expected to<br>have mental health problems from the<br>earthquakes<br>okay we've also collected we advertised<br>and asked for people to volunteer if<br>they felt they were resilient from the<br>earthquakes whatever they felt that<br>might mean could they contact us and we<br>ask them some questions and we did some<br>biological measures as well in order to<br>compare them with people who were very<br>badly affected and we asked people to<br>tell us about the earthquake experiences<br>and what they had found helpful so the<br>resilient group of people at the time of<br>the earthquake they very interestingly<br>describe things in really quite factual<br>ways they talked about the power of the<br>event it was amazing how much the ground<br>shook it was amazing how everyone helped<br>each other out I'm so lucky I wasn't in<br>that building that fell down that<br>whereas people with bad difficulties<br>with post-traumatic stress they are<br>terrified by what happened they cut they<br>can think of nothing positive and it's<br>all very not negative and catastrophic<br>and if they weren't in a building that<br>fell down they would never use the way<br>at words lucky they would say but what<br>if I had been and I almost was there so<br>really different themes and when the<br>people who are resilient talk about<br>what's helped them they generally talk<br>about their really keep a very<br>optimistic frame of mind they don't<br>focus on things that are negative they<br>don't focus on things they can't control<br>because there's no point in that they<br>really keep going with the things they<br>like their own goals they listen to<br>their bodies and they recognize what<br>keeps them well and they do it and they<br>often describe things like making<br>meaning out of things that they can see<br>what they've learned from it and that's<br>a theme that has been echoed from trauma<br>research from way back so people who've<br>looked at people who survived the<br>Holocaust the people that<br>don't have PTSD usually describe they<br>got meaning out of it they learnt things<br>about themselves and other people that<br>they've used positively and one other<br>thing that we've also found which was<br>also from the Christchurch health and<br>development study was that the people<br>who had the greatest earthquake exposure<br>often were the people who had the<br>biggest positive effects so that's<br>actually again talking about look if you<br>can get through this adversity and do<br>well you can do really well and<br>interestingly women talked about having<br>a greatest distress at the time of the<br>earthquakes but also they talked about<br>having the greatest benefit as well so<br>you know it's an interesting area to<br>think about why that's happening and<br>some of the biology might explain that<br>I'm going to touch on shortly so how do<br>we make sense of all that because it is<br>it is quite complex I think I think we<br>can say that resilience is the majority<br>response that most people are okay<br>they've adapted they may not be<br>completely out of the woods but there<br>are on the way to it and they won't have<br>long-term mental health effects from it<br>suppose the other thing we need to think<br>about is that this environment we've<br>been in as well as being very difficult<br>it isn't normal in terms of what's been<br>available to people that actually has<br>been a lot of support put in that other<br>places in the country haven't had and so<br>we have to remember that it's not a<br>completely level playing field and we<br>also have to remember that non<br>help-seeking is very common we really<br>often hear how people say well I'm not I<br>don't need you because they're other<br>people worse off than me or I shouldn't<br>be like this because I haven't lost so<br>much so you know just because people<br>aren't coming forward doesn't mean they<br>don't have difficulties and I think<br>particularly now we need to<br>remember that there are people out there<br>who are still struggling and how we can<br>actually put them in touch with help the<br>help that they do need if these are the<br>difficulties they're having at the<br>moment they should be getting help okay<br>I just wanted to have one slide about<br>animals because when I was thinking<br>about the neuroscience a lot of what we<br>know about neuroscience is based on<br>animal models and I thought ah I thought<br>about that because also when you think<br>about what we've been through with the<br>aftershocks there isn't really an animal<br>model that they've had before that would<br>explain that and I don't think any<br>ethics committee would you allow you to<br>do that any animal anyway so I spoke<br>with the vet who's been very involved in<br>companion animals so he said he couldn't<br>talk about other animals but what his<br>experiences were he said that there's<br>been lots of rapport and I've heard this<br>that the birds left before the<br>earthquakes hit so and it's well<br>recognized that animals do have a kind<br>of more acute sense their senses than we<br>do and what what he talked about with<br>dogs and cats was that they fled<br>initially so the fight flight response<br>they flew and not bird fly but they flew<br>a lot of them got lost from their owners<br>but they actually hadn't gone very far<br>they usually gone within their territory<br>and were just hiding out there a lot of<br>them had exaggerated startle responses<br>that jumpiness that I talked about that<br>we had animals had that a lot and there<br>were lots of prescribing avanza lytic<br>but most of them gradually improved and<br>he also said there was a huge variation<br>in spectrum of response so again just<br>like us because we are animals so there<br>was some who were absolutely completely<br>not affected and others who were jumping<br>into owners beds at the slightest<br>aftershock so he said he got a<br>rottweiler and it just a jump you know<br>almost before the aftershock hit so he<br>didn't wait with the aftershock he<br>certainly won't when Rockville Landsman<br>and the risk seemed similar the same<br>Rock Varla he was a rescue dog and you<br>know have been previously traumatized he<br>thought and interestingly he said look a<br>lot of the animals<br>to their owners response and we'd seen<br>that in children as well so if there was<br>an anxious child there was often an<br>anxious parent so if there was an<br>anxious dog there was often anxious<br>owner so turning to the neuroscience now<br>when we're thinking about all this we<br>need to be able to explain how we all<br>need to be able to respond to a very<br>frightening experience so I think we all<br>get that now you know we our bodies need<br>to be wired to do that and having been<br>through what we've been through here you<br>can see the necessity of that so I'm<br>going to talk about the fear network and<br>then have what the normal response to<br>fear is and then how that might get<br>aggravated and set off with we're<br>repeatedly going and experiencing<br>aftershocks and then how might<br>persistent stress so this is the<br>secondary stress stuff the juggling all<br>these balls hand like that affect us and<br>then talk about PTSD so you don't need<br>to remember the details of this but this<br>is the fear network that we all have in<br>our brains so we see something we hear<br>something or for us we feel something<br>the ground shaking goes into the<br>thalamus and then into this part of the<br>brain called the amygdala which is<br>almost like the computer comparator part<br>of our brain so this sends messages up<br>to the thinking part of the brain<br>frontal cortex do I need to be scared<br>about this it has pathways to the<br>hippocampus which is involved with<br>memory have I been frightened by this<br>before and then it coordinates the kind<br>of fight flight response the autonomic<br>pathways the sympathetic nervous system<br>the hypothalamus and the release of<br>cortisol so that's we've all got that we<br>all need to have that sorry right so<br>when we're in a really frightening<br>situation we need to respond really<br>quickly and get safe so that amygdala<br>gets activated and what that does is it<br>focuses all our attention on the<br>frightening thing and it prepares us to<br>fight or run or in some cases freeze not<br>move the frontal part of our brain is<br>not so important we don't need to be<br>thinking what am I getting for shopping<br>you know what's what what are we havin<br>to dinner tonight it's completely<br>irrelevant we just need to get safely<br>out so the frontal part of our brain<br>gets moved offline because we don't need<br>it we also know that when we're in a<br>frightening situation we get a big<br>release of noradrenaline that focuses<br>our attention on things it puts our<br>blood pressure up it makes a heart pump<br>faster it prepares us to get out<br>physically releases cortisol and that's<br>trying to monitor the response so it<br>doesn't carry on that it can switch off<br>so in a frightening situation the<br>now when we exposed to frequent<br>aftershocks that are making us<br>experience frightening things repeatedly<br>unpredictably in a way we can't control<br>the amygdala is going to get even more<br>activated it's almost firing on its own<br>kind of engine because it's repeatedly<br>getting activated and it's that's what's<br>causing us to do this exaggerated<br>startle response that I talked about and<br>it also explains why other stimuli get<br>conditioned to have the same response so<br>something that feels even slightly like<br>that activates the amygdala because it's<br>getting a memory for frightening<br>experiences and gradually that will<br>reduce if the aftershocks stop but I<br>think we all noticed that happening and<br>if you think you have<br>more human again now I'm not jumping at<br>everything and then there will be a few<br>more aftershocks that immediately start<br>up again because it really easily get<br>Sri triggered now what might happen to<br>us if we're under assistant stress I'm<br>Rob Gordon I don't know if you've heard<br>him talk he's an expert from Australia<br>who's a very wise man has talked about<br>this a lot and he talked about that what<br>happens is again our amygdala is what's<br>driving us that we focus just on the<br>threat in front of us we think really<br>narrowly we don't think about the bigger<br>things we just think about the problem<br>and must get uqc sorted I must do this<br>we stop thinking about other things and<br>actually the things that usually do is<br>good are the other things the exercising<br>they're doing something enjoyable the<br>spending time with your partner all that<br>drops off and that explains why we're in<br>this constant exhausted state and while<br>we can't remember anything so we're<br>being driven by this amygdala what does<br>this look like I mean made most of us<br>can look in the mirror and just about<br>this but it's this head down blinkered<br>approach to things and we try to<br>constantly deal with the stress I just<br>get that done I just get that done I<br>just get that down it'll all be okay but<br>it isn't because it's a relentless list<br>and we're not thinking strategically<br>we're just thinking about the thing in<br>front of us and we've stopped doing all<br>the things that actually are going to<br>make us better and that's going to have<br>big impacts on our health and well-being<br>and all the things that actually are<br>what really matter in life not getting<br>to the end of the list but being well<br>so what we what we think is people who<br>are resilient haven't got that<br>hyperactive amygdala they've had it but<br>they've done things about it that have<br>switched it toned it down so it can<br>still respond when it needs to but it's<br>the question is why are they able to do<br>that people who are resilient why can<br>they do it and other people not do it<br>and again you can think of that in<br>different ways but it's because their<br>fear network is being much more<br>controlled by the top down because of<br>things usually it's because of things<br>they're doing usually it's these things<br>that they're doing after the event to an<br>extent they were doing before but<br>they're definitely doing them now<br>they've got good social factors there<br>well-connected they keep on doing the<br>things that keep them well they're much<br>more optimistic and they're very<br>flexible in the way they cope with<br>things so it's not it's not a<br>prescriptive if we all do this we'll be<br>fine what really keeps you well is you<br>to be able to do this at one time and<br>this at another time and it's that<br>flexibility that the really resilient<br>people seem to be showing okay so<br>finally turning to post-traumatic stress<br>disorder I told you what that looks like<br>in terms of the re experiencing symptoms<br>particularly with these memories<br>flashbacks and nightmares and the<br>avoidance that people have and being<br>very hyper aroused what seems to be<br>different about the people with PTSD is<br>again they're being driven by their<br>amygdala but there's also that they have<br>done something at the time of the trauma<br>the memories about their trauma have got<br>lodged in a way that isn't normal for<br>memories so they're not processed in a<br>way that normally we process things<br>because normally when something happens<br>to us we have a story about it we have a<br>story about what we were doing before<br>what happened and then what happened<br>afterwards with people with PTSD it's<br>the experience has been so overwhelming<br>there's no processing that's gone on it<br>all gets stored in a very primitive<br>sensory way so things like smells or<br>sounds bring the memory back<br>and people can't control it and it's a<br>terrifying experience so in treatment<br>not only do you need to control the<br>amygdala but uni also need to teach<br>people ways of dealing with those<br>memories so they can process for them in<br>a normal way so they don't get erased<br>but they are not reactivated in this<br>terrifying way that they have been<br>previously so finally what will help all<br>of us that we've talked about what would<br>help people with PTSD absolutely it is<br>dealing with the real practical<br>stressors I'm not I've no doubt that if<br>we really dealt with those it would help<br>a lot of people but we also need to<br>focus and doing things that help our<br>well-being which is not a passive thing<br>is something you actually have to do and<br>a lot of us know about it but it's more<br>than knowing that it we've actually got<br>to do something about it because we know<br>that although some of your well-being is<br>predetermined by your genes the<br>ridiculously happy people that are all<br>around us home but a lot of it is by<br>things you can subsequently do and you<br>truly can change this there's been lots<br>of research about this this is positive<br>psychology but it's things like<br>nurturing social relationships doing<br>things you love doing these are called<br>flow activities things where you really<br>lose yourself in it like for example<br>doing art or doing music or redoing<br>anything we've all we all have all got<br>them really look at what's important to<br>you and making yourself do it stop<br>overthinking and constantly ruminating<br>about things you can't change because it<br>doesn't help the UK have put a lot of<br>effort into looking at this and they've<br>come up with these five ways to<br>well-being that you've probably heard a<br>lot about that the all right campaign is<br>based on and all these things do is they<br>activate the thinking part of your brain<br>and suppress that overactive amygdala<br>so these these are the five things so<br>giving of your time connecting with<br>people keeping learning being active and<br>taking notice mindfulness type<br>approaches and the all right campaign<br>you've probably seen about about town is<br>entirely based on doing that and getting<br>it into schools because as I said a lot<br>about knowing it but actually doing it<br>so the take-home messages absolutely we<br>need to sort the practical stresses we<br>absolutely need to support and treat the<br>people who need it and there are people<br>who need it and still there are people<br>that need it and we need to recognize<br>but not only recognize actually do the<br>things that keep us well oh so that was<br>one more slide there isn't but the last<br>slide is thanks to my amazing colleagues<br>who've actually done a lot of this work<br>you<br>you</p></main><footer
