to<br>greet all of you and all of your various<br>capacities both personal and<br>professional and uh and also to spare a<br>thought for our uh Marty King at this<br>time who um fulfills an important role<br>for uh for the king Tanga and um and ask<br>for blessings on his health and<br>well-being um also to those who' have<br>passed on to the next world but who are<br>with us<br>uh in spirit I um send thoughts to them<br>and greet all of those of yours who have<br>passed on uh and acknowledge that while<br>we come as individuals there's a uh a<br>mess be that stand behind us so uh to<br>you and to them uh good evening and um I<br>look forward to having a bit of a<br>conversation with you<br>tonight um Gavin and I are a double act<br>uh um I haven't played a major role in E<br>Partnerships um Gavin's been much more<br>at the Forefront and I'm on the board so<br>I tend to be a little bit further<br>removed from the direct Partnerships but<br>um have a bit of an understanding of how<br>it all works so try to bring that to the<br>discussion around it so tonight just<br>really want to talk to you about the<br>Partnerships that Mighty River power's<br>been involved in and some of the<br>principles that underly that<br>um because Mighty River has been held up<br>as a bit of an example in terms of some<br>of the um relationships that we've been<br>able to develop particularly in moving<br>beyond passive land owner leasehold type<br>um relationships where a developer comes<br>in and pays the land owner for the use<br>of the land and they receive a a rental<br>and a fairly passive in the whole thing<br>we've um we've moved into uh<br>co-constructive type relationships where<br>the land owners have an involvement and<br>an interest in the development and um<br>and that's been good for us and good for<br>them so just to tell you a little bit<br>about some some of the context and<br>principles of moving into those sorts of<br>relationships um I've been on the board<br>of Mighty River now for 13 and a half<br>years which is a fairly long lag and I<br>come off next month so um that's this is<br>one of the last things I probably do uh<br>in my capacity with Mighty River but<br>during that time a key involvement and<br>and one of the reasons that I'm on the<br>board is to support ways from for mildy<br>and mighty River Power to work together<br>for Mutual benefit uh including cultural<br>environmental and economic benefit and<br>over that time the company's undertaken<br>a number of significant power projects<br>so we've developed had already developed<br>a power station at morai which is 75%<br>owned by two<br>aduy um trust and and 25% owned by<br>Mighty River Power and there's an you<br>know option at some stage for the trust<br>to take over full ownership of that to<br>toar North number two trust uh we've<br>built a power station at rotokawa and<br>that's a 5050 JV with them we also have<br>uh another Power Station on their land<br>at n<br>tamariki uh we also have naua geothermal<br>power station which is 65% Mighty River<br>and 35%<br>toara um and and other and there are<br>others so we'll go into a bit more<br>detail around some of those soon but the<br>mighty River Power two and toara<br>grouping is now one of the world's<br>largest geothermal power stations by<br>installed<br>capacity so we've got about 40%<br>geothermal makes up about 40% ENT of<br>Mighty River's total generation<br>portfolio and it provides premium base<br>load generation which unlike other<br>renewable energy resources is not<br>weather<br>dependent so most of this capacity has<br>been developed um over the time that<br>I've been on the boards I've got to see<br>how those relationships have worked up<br>and it's no easy feat to get uh through<br>those projects and and and and the<br>arrangements that underly them but in<br>addition to those thermal power station<br>SMY River operates nine Hydro stations<br>on the wle river and this involves us<br>with relation in relationships with E<br>and hapu along the river and so there<br>are a number of relationship agreements<br>around that uh those um Partnerships as<br>well so the projects have have been led<br>by the team at Mighty River and my part<br>has been at the board level to assist<br>with a cultural understanding around uh<br>the backdrop to those and to assist to<br>guide good strategy and business<br>decisions so it's really about that<br>cultural backdrop that I want to talk a<br>bit uh about tonight and then Gavin<br>will'll get<br>into um the actual nuts and<br>bolts so it's a good space that we've<br>got to uh at the mo you know now uh it's<br>a good space to be in these kinds of<br>relationships the tribes have been there<br>for a long time and they're not going<br>anywhere<br>if you take one of my tribes in the in<br>the tinui<br>region uh when we look at the cultural<br>landscape There Our Ancestors came out<br>800 odd years ago settled at carfia over<br>time made their way Inland settled the<br>whole sort of region that we've come to<br>know as tinui but actually goes from<br>taranaki morco in the South right up<br>into to Oakland South<br>Oakland uh over including the haki<br>golf uh through tomari so there's this<br>there's this very large area that takes<br>in a lot of the wle<br>river and overlay there are generations<br>and I think it's about 40 Generations<br>from my ancestors that came on the on<br>the canoe from out of French Polynesia<br>to cfia is about 40 Generations<br>through to us and so we know the stories<br>about many of those ancestors and we<br>know where they lived and we know what<br>they did and so when we look at the<br>landscape it's with that kind of lens we<br>know the stories that go with that hill<br>and who was which of our personal<br>ancestors were involved where they<br>buried bones you know all these whole<br>Rich tapestry of cultural overlay that's<br>there when we look at our landscape and<br>it guides what we do so it's a very very<br>personal our connection with the land<br>and with the river and with everything<br>in the region it's a it's a personal<br>history and so when we come to talk<br>about things related to it um you know<br>we can get a bit uh well we take it<br>seriously because on top of that we've<br>been told that we have responsibility to<br>keep it all in good shape for future<br>generations and we know that our<br>ancestors did their best in the times<br>that they had available to them to look<br>after the place and that now we've got<br>our time and we have the same<br>responsibility and that we've be handing<br>that on to the next Generation so all of<br>that is in the back of our minds when we<br>sit down at the table to<br>talk so having um having that<br>intergenerational responsibility and<br>then coming to the table with with<br>Mighty River Power who actually has very<br>similar imperatives the company is in it<br>for the Long Haul the hydr stations are<br>not<br>short-term um assets they will be<br>operating for a long long time and um<br>unless there's some<br>revolutionary technology that disrupts<br>it all uh Hydro energy is going to be a<br>key part of our uh generating<br>future uh also the um geothermal assets<br>likewise are going to be around for a<br>long long time so our ability to operate<br>relies on having a license to operate<br>from those people in the community who<br>are our key stakeholders and ewi and<br>hapu are in that category and so our<br>interests are aligned our interests are<br>aligned in the sense that we're in it<br>for a long time we want to get on with<br>each other this is not a quick fix this<br>is an enduring type of relationship that<br>we need to<br>strike uh secondly we we both really<br>care about the<br>environment the company needs a healthy<br>environment within which to operate it<br>also needs to ensure that uh it is a<br>good operator in in a community sense<br>and that it's doing good things for um<br>in terms of the the the natural<br>resources that we use so we so our our<br>interests are fairly well aligned in<br>that space as well um so there's some<br>there's some good reasons for us to be<br>able to sit down and work things out and<br>so that's why I say we're in a pretty<br>space the cultural context that we<br>operate in is largely unseen it's hard<br>it's hard to understand if you're not<br>from it it's hard to see it it's hard to<br>know what it is M talk in terms that a<br>lot of people don't understand when we<br>talk about our CH it's hard to nail it<br>down in a short sentence and make it<br>understandable because the Expressions<br>that we use don't come from the English<br>language<br>because the concepts are backed up by a<br>whole lot of values in history it's<br>really hard to explain it we kind of<br>know it but we can't necessarily<br>articulate it well for you or somebody<br>else to understand so it takes time to<br>work our way through we know what's<br>important to us but it takes time for us<br>to co-construct solutions that are going<br>to be enduring for us the guy in the top<br>photo there his name is Bill Galvin and<br>when I first started on Mighty River he<br>was one of the first people I met during<br>my induction process his people come<br>from a place called<br>oraku it's a geothermal kind of area<br>along the banks of the<br>river<br>his family he was born at the par right<br>at the side of the river<br>and his mother and his grandmother had<br>their homes<br>he was party to all the stories around<br>the flooding of that territory when the<br>hydro dams were put<br>in his<br>PA and his family's par went<br>underwater as a result of the hydro and<br>his people were moved up<br>land that was a place that they had<br>occupied for hundreds of years<br>in the ground were the bones of his<br>ancestors and caves along the River Bank<br>were the bones of his<br>ancestors those had to be<br>relocated in order for the hydro to be<br>accommodated uh and many things came<br>floating up when the when the river came<br>down ancestors and all sorts of things<br>floated to the surface when he took me<br>up the river we stopped at one point and<br>we had kakia we had prayer because we<br>were above the<br>marai on the<br>water and and his pain was palpable<br>because he was he he lived through the<br>anguish of his mother and his<br>grandmother and all their<br>families at this happening and them not<br>being able to do anything about<br>it and<br>uh he carries that with him and he takes<br>it very seriously when he talks to us<br>about trying to keep their memory alive<br>trying to keep that connection with what<br>what was there and trying to protect and<br>preserve uh their cultural identity for<br>the<br>future so they're not simple<br>conversations they're emotional<br>conversations loaded with all kind of<br>history and values and they really need<br>us to understand that when we talk to<br>them Marty is one of those cultures<br>that's called a high context culture and<br>I don't know what the particular fields<br>of study are but there are some cultures<br>that are more that are labeled high<br>content cultures and others that are<br>high context cultures High context<br>cultures it's important to take care of<br>a whole lot of contextual issues before<br>you get down to the content of whatever<br>it is that you're dealing with Marty is<br>one of those so it's important to us to<br>build the relationship to<br>acknowledge uh the past to understand<br>everything around a subject before we<br>get down to the subject so that's why we<br>have these very long processes of<br>Engagement that's why when you go into a<br>mudi we have the formal poty process and<br>speechmaking goes on and on and on on<br>and we love it because we're building<br>our connections to one another and we're<br>telling and we're going back for all<br>kinds of um historical uh periods and<br>we're telling all sorts of things that<br>other people think are completely<br>irrelevant but to us it's fundamental to<br>building the context and we find our<br>connections and then we and we have a<br>cup of tea and we we might spend a long<br>time doing that before we get to the<br>matter that we've come to deal with the<br>thing is with a high context culture<br>we're physically uncomfortable if we<br>haven't done that so when we come into a<br>meeting and people say right cup of tea<br>let's go right what we're here for is<br>this our old people squirm because<br>physically they feel unsettled because<br>we haven't had kakia we haven't had Mii<br>Mii they don't know who you are where<br>you come from they don't know where you<br>were born where you they don't know if<br>you might be a relation of theirs or<br>have some sort of connection and unless<br>and until those sorts of things are<br>dealt with they can't really effectively<br>get down to the matter at Heart of<br>course we've moved on and we've<br>acculturated and we've learned to be<br>able to to cope with that but actually<br>our old people haven't you know people<br>like<br>Bill it's really he's one of those kind<br>of old guys where that's really<br>difficult so if we want to have a good<br>conversation with him we need to we need<br>to be able to recognize and respect his<br>culture and get him to a place where he<br>we can communicate effectively<br>so culture is really<br>important um<br>so back to my notes which I've kind of<br>at the treaty stuff the Treaty of white<br>tonging<br>just move on a bit before I do this is<br>uh the bottom photo is from the opening<br>station Niki Power Station uh toar<br>trust and the<br>trustees after many many years and there<br>are many many many years involved in<br>getting these projects up and running<br>and Trust<br>toil unpaid<br>generally through the very complex<br>processes with Mighty River Power many<br>of these guys have not had a tertiary<br>education and are having to deal with<br>quite<br>complicated Financial structures and<br>legal<br>constructs and<br>generating uh<br>models and they<br>uh have to get themselves up to speed<br>although the company is supportive and<br>they have to get them wrap their heads<br>around what's going on because they are<br>committing on behalf of their people<br>they have to go back to their<br>stakeholders their land owners and<br>explain it all to them and a and a way<br>that they will get the Mandate and the<br>support to sign up to the agreement it's<br>a long process people die through it and<br>someone else comes on and has to get up<br>to speed or elections are held and<br>someone new comes on and they have to<br>get up to speed and your people just<br>might not agree and you might have to<br>have who after who after who to get them<br>through to a point where they uh<br>understand and support<br>enough so uh these guys work really hard<br>to get these relationships up and<br>running<br>the other kind of big backdrop to all of<br>this is the treaty<br>relationship<br>so the treaty relationship exists<br>between iwi and hapu and the<br>government so mighty river is not the<br>treaty partner the government is the<br>treaty partner but there are a number of<br>of matters within that treaty<br>relationship that impact on<br>us so for example at the moment there<br>there's a there's the water ownership<br>issues there's fresh water<br>claims and that has some bearing on<br>Mighty River depending on what the<br>outcome will be it certainly had some<br>bearing when we tried to go through our<br>IPO process and we were held up with<br>water claims issues so there's those<br>kinds of things there's the um land<br>claim so land along the river land under<br>the river who owns the land under the<br>lake you know there's all that sort of<br>stuff happening around us so there's<br>that treaty relationship that we need to<br>know about and the the<br>treaty under the second article afforded<br>and<br>um of their land forest Fisheries Etc so<br>there's a conep in there that I and Hau<br>adhere to around uh their relationship<br>with their natural resources in their<br>territories and how they exert their<br>responsibility to care for<br>those and the ideas around their ability<br>to care come from kakit Tanga and that<br>Now features in legislation and it's in<br>the resource management act and hence<br>you know that's another part that the<br>treaty relationship comes through that<br>brings to bear on to Mighty Rivers's<br>activities so the tribes having the<br>concept of being custodians which is not<br>the right word for kakang but it's hard<br>to find one<br>um uh are grappling with trying to deal<br>with a different cultural construct that<br>talks about ownership and so the fit's<br>not quite right and so we keep running<br>into each other around who owns what or<br>who has authority over what or who you<br>know who has the say and so now we're<br>getting more and more into the space of<br>co-governance and co-management<br>Arrangements which is really um actually<br>quite helpful for Mighty River Power<br>because it means that we've got parties<br>at the table co- constructing solutions<br>to complex<br>problems um so that we find ourselves in<br>a lot of that territory through Resource<br>Management act issues and um the Crown's<br>relationship<br>but tea is reflected through legislation<br>in some places and so that that then<br>requires the company to have to<br>understand these<br>things so all I'm trying to do here is<br>just to let you know not to<br>underestimate the complexity of this<br>landscape it's not easy to get these<br>kind of projects up and running because<br>you've got this multiplicity of issues<br>to work your way<br>through some of the key principles<br>around entering into arrangements with I<br>and Hau or negotiating with I and Hau<br>you know<br>relationship because of<br>this<br>intergenerational uh Legacy because of<br>the high context culture relationships<br>are fundamental to being able to do good<br>business relationships need to be<br>developed before you need<br>them before the hard stuff comes in<br>relationships have a long lead in time<br>relationships are all about getting to<br>see the whites of your eyes and knowing<br>whether we can trust each<br>other what what is the cut of your cloth<br>what is the level of your integrity are<br>you are you here to do a quick and Duty<br>and get what you can for yourself or are<br>we going to be in this together for a<br>long time and can we actually coexist<br>and and uh work to create good outcomes<br>for one another and so it takes time to<br>get to that point and it might seem that<br>you're investing a whole lot of activity<br>that is not is tangental to the uh issue<br>but it's an investment it's an<br>investment in good outcomes and it's<br>it's part of what you have to do so it's<br>about respecting uh culture recognizing<br>and respecting that there's something<br>else going on over there and trying to<br>get to understand<br>it and and it takes time but you get to<br>a point where you start to be side by<br>side instead of across the table and<br>then you and then the good stuff starts<br>happening um there are multiple multiple<br>own uh stakeholders on the other side of<br>the table when you're dealing with Ian<br>Hau so if we're talking about the river<br>we're generally talking about either<br>land trusts along the river or we're<br>talking about tribes that operate around<br>that that River's territory and they can<br>have 30 40,000 members<br>and all of those members um have an<br>interest in what's going on and tribes<br>operate generally try to operate in a<br>fairly<br>Collective uh manner where they consult<br>and give people an opportunity to uh<br>know what's going on so open and<br>transparent as possible and so all of<br>that takes time and land trusts have<br>many many many owners um and same thing<br>it all takes a lot of time so hopefully<br>you're getting the<br>impression that it's not easy and it<br>takes time and all the rest of it but<br>it's pretty uh it's pretty good when you<br>get there when you get into that sweet<br>space of actually they trust us and we<br>can do business together and we've put<br>in the hard yards and now we're going to<br>get on and make some things happen<br>because then we find for example that<br>the that the Land Trust starts taking<br>responsibility for getting the resource<br>consent Buy in from stakeholders the<br>land trust becomes an advocate so it's<br>not just Mighty River going in and<br>saying look we want to operate something<br>here and um Community can you give us<br>your support and they go you know evil<br>dirty uh corporate taking advantage of<br>us we've then got the tribe alongside us<br>saying actually we've been with these<br>guys for a long time we've done business<br>we've done some other things you know we<br>trust them we're going to we'll come out<br>and help explain what's going on and and<br>open so that's bill again isn't it<br>that's bill that's the same guy I was<br>talking about uh with Doug Heen and the<br>chief executive and and you know having<br>been on the board for a long time I can<br>say that it gets personal you can't help<br>but get personal cuz Marty make it<br>personal it's personal for us so we make<br>it personal for you too and so it's<br>pretty hard you know I'd say Doug would<br>say that he got to a really he's really<br>proud and got to a really good space<br>tribes so I won't go on too much more uh<br>I'll let Gavin talk a bit um now about<br>the the nuts and bolts having been at<br>the at the face of it but I but I will<br>say that we're<br>proud Mar are<br>proud when we get to these days which is<br>when we open the the power station after<br>many years of hard yards to get there<br>and and it's been a privilege to see the<br>the land owners modest and humble people<br>who have achieved these<br>magnificent arrang ments for their<br>descendants<br>and just just as a a little aside you<br>know one of them on the opening of this<br>big Grand geothermal power<br>station um decided that the land trust<br>members should celebrate all the signing<br>of the agreements they wanted to have a<br>celebration so they hired out the local<br>topal pools and put on a little pool<br>party for everybody not withstanding<br>that they now you know you know had<br>million multi-million dollar investments<br>in these big Power stations they<br>splashed out a little bit and had a um<br>and they you know they they've been so<br>cautious for so long and so careful that<br>um<br>they that was their thing to Splash out<br>a bit but I think over time when they<br>you know there's going to be benefits<br>coming through for all of their<br>stakeholders and that's going to be<br>something that I think we can all<br>support to be proud of so this is kind<br>of what they end up with a brand<br>spanking shiny new geothermal power<br>station um but I won't talk anymore<br>there I'll just hand over to Gavin<br>who'll take you through a bit more<br>detail because he's been right in the<br>I uh just we've got about about 15 to 20<br>minutes left so I might um uh move<br>through a couple of the sides reasonably<br>quickly but this I just wanted to make<br>sure I guess this is the fordward no<br>it's yep it's the forward so so just um<br>quickly summarizing uh mighty repair at<br>a glance in terms of uh of those for<br>those who are not absolutely familiar<br>with some of the things we do and I<br>guess my point is that a lot of this is<br>driven off the back of our Partnerships<br>is the point I'm trying to make with<br>these so we obviously have a strong<br>retail business um we are now uh almost<br>100% renewable and that is uh largely<br>Hydro but um around 40% of our<br>generation is geothermal now we are a um<br>a<br>meter provider for the automatic<br>metering process um we have uh now<br>entered into the partially listed<br>environment where we have around 100,000<br>uh shareholders and a market cap of<br>about 4 billion so you'll see there our<br>our uh pride of place also as as a<br>trusted partner for um the land trusts<br>uh for a lot of our ewe that we deal<br>with uh every day so I guess as as um<br>tan just pointed out the key Foundation<br>of our growth has been those commercial<br>relationships with with moldi<br>particularly in relation to<br>geothermal so so where did it start for<br>us and I guess we put this slide up here<br>because at the end of the day we<br>originally started off as a<br>hydrogenation company so the assets that<br>Mighty rer power um inherited purchased<br>from Crown was largely the W Hydro<br>System hence M repair now it's a um it's<br>more it's a backbone of our of our<br>operation and I guess what we learned in<br>the early days is that it's is that it<br>it is very much more than an uh than an<br>asset to River ewi and it sustains life<br>provides for its people it's a living<br>being uh as whitean will refer to it it<br>from I'm the river and the river is me<br>and I guess um this slide also is is<br>relevant too for this is cat pedo for<br>those of you who know it um cter Stone<br>pedo you will smell and it gets its name<br>um from one of the major battles that<br>took place there um and looking at that<br>slide uh even even now you can you can<br>see so up on the top right uh is the uh<br>is the switch Shard for the station<br>that's situated right on an old<br>occupation site so that used to be a<br>parite um and there's a second one in<br>that Place uh just just down a little<br>bit and and interestingly um I guess the<br>damage that to those sorts of um sorts<br>of assets still continue I would say<br>it's anybody Riven the sorry ridden the<br>uh TIAA Cycle Way which runs along<br>between Cambridge Hamilton right well in<br>the building of that that chopped a<br>piece off off the corner of uh of that<br>paride of kapiro um so we're still doing<br>these uh I guess these dumb things uh<br>when it comes to some of these hyaric<br>assets so um kapo the other the other<br>point it demonstrates for me um and I<br>come back to my point that I made around<br>um the river being the mother uh and and<br>you someone the very recently likened<br>our dams on the river to um to a torn<br>around the arm and you can see the<br>kapiro uh effectively blocks off the<br>river so what we have is is a is a<br>National Asset it's a it's a fantastic<br>asset but what it's also done is it in<br>my mind has has U for the national good<br>you've had a disproportionate um amount<br>of payment and pain for the river ewi in<br>this case so that sort of context um is<br>one that we built up uh and and have<br>certainly have the scars to prove it<br>through our resource consenting process<br>uh there was a lot of difficult lessons<br>for us uh in dealing with uh with River<br>ewi and the reconing process but what<br>that did is it is it you know what<br>doesn't kill you make you stronger it it<br>effectively led to some very strong and<br>enduring relationships uh that we have<br>uh with river ewi and um I recall one of<br>the um wo people said to me recently<br>that you can't you know you uh can never<br>solve an argument unless you understand<br>each other uh and so a big part of uh of<br>who we are is trying to understand our<br>partners and that has come from uh what<br>we learned on the river so um I guess<br>that's that's defined us we've learned<br>some valuable lessons I mean we have um<br>we have Engineers now who who who kind<br>of understand the concept that if you if<br>you put a if you put build a bridge<br>across River it's not just about<br>hydraulic flow it's not just about<br>engineering CS you're actually<br>puncturing the body of the mother and if<br>you think of those sorts of Concepts it<br>actually um gives you a a very different<br>focus and a different perspective and<br>again uh it helps you understand uh your<br>partners so um so very early on we<br>realized the value in having those<br>strong e relationships uh along the<br>river and um in the Y it it um it it<br>flows through number of um of Roi for<br>Endura wanu and all of those um e the E<br>welder like like New Zealand generally<br>is a small is a small place all of those<br>individuals have uh have uh have trusts<br>have relationships outside of the river<br>and a lot of that has led to uh us<br>dealing with some of the same people uh<br>in terms of our G development so again<br>hence it's made it's meant how showed<br>how the importance of getting those<br>place so just um and I'll just this is<br>is uh I guess a little more mundane in<br>terms of uh terms of tracking our<br>geothermal growth but if you look at the<br>green bars you can see that that's a<br>That's mighty repairs geothermal growth<br>so we've invested more than 1.4 billion<br>and we've successfully completed three<br>geal power stations domestically since<br>20 8 and as I said before it now takes<br>up 40% of Our Generation premium<br>renewable base load I'm sure have tell<br>most of the people in this room runs<br>24/7 typically generates about three<br>times more electricity than an<br>equivalent sized Wind Farm um and double<br>that of hydro so Hydro the um capacity<br>factors or utilization rate on um on the<br>river uh is around 40 45 to 50% in other<br>words utilization 45 50% of the time you<br>using your generators um um geothermal<br>24/7 um everything's going so um it is<br>it is a great it is a great uh<br>generation Source it's not subject to<br>rain wind uh Sun um and has a very small<br>physical footprint and I guess you look<br>at a lot of our developments you<br>actually can't see them uh from from<br>most often or not you can't see them<br>from public spaces um Nat tamariki for<br>example sits right in the middle of the<br>forest You' got to drive five six GS<br>into the forest till you get to it um so<br>foot from wise uh you know it's it's a<br>great outcome but I would say that<br>geothermal is certainly not for the<br>fainthearted and does come with comes<br>with a lot of risks uh it comes with uh<br>certainly comes with risks in terms of<br>well success uh comes with risks in<br>terms of uh in terms of doal fluid um<br>and just operating those power stations<br>uh hence might has bu out quite a quite<br>a technical resource um in terms of gal<br>development um just uh looking uh<br>talking a little bit more about the<br>strengths of of our Partnerships so<br>those are long-term Partnerships with M<br>trust owners um and it's allowed us to<br>generate some long-term value um and and<br>also it has allowed more importantly our<br>partners to generate long-term value uh<br>and uh it it it's also enabled some<br>Equity involvement uh in those stations<br>as well and I'll make the point um later<br>as well but it but it's important to um<br>it's really important to understand uh<br>the partners that you're dealing de with<br>and understanding what is the best<br>solution for them if you come in with a<br>one size fits all you're bound to fail<br>in other words what I'm trying to say is<br>that is that for some uh you've got to<br>recognize that Equity is an option for<br>others it's absolutely not uh and you're<br>looking at a um a stream a resource<br>rental for fluid or something like that<br>um cash flow stream so it's all about<br>understanding their cash flow situation<br>uh and to do that you've also got to<br>make sure that they have the best<br>advises available to them so this is a<br>long-term partnership and it it comes<br>back to Tanya's Point uh that you're not<br>you know you're not here to um you know<br>you're not here to outmaneuver your<br>partner in the contracts um or or to get<br>one across them from a from an economic<br>perspective uh this is about a long-term<br>enduring partnership your partner has to<br>be um has to be getting Mutual benefit<br>out of this process so a lot of the time<br>that involves equipping uh the land<br>trusts uh with the right advisors<br>helping them set up the trusts uh<br>helping them uh through their own<br>governance and decision-making processes<br>um and and you heard Tanya talk about<br>how how difficult that is for a lot of<br>those Land Trust individuals so they<br>haven't dealt with decisions of this<br>sort of<br>nature so um I guess um the other point<br>I make is that uh those values uh need<br>to be closely linked to sustainable land<br>use uh and embrace Concepts such as M<br>Mali um tier issues you've got to<br>understand those before you can really<br>um successfully develop a project like<br>these and that's where um Mighty River<br>pairs values uh have been pretty are<br>well aligned uh with all of our U<br>partners and as Tanya said we are in it<br>for the long haul we're not going away<br>we've got long-term assets uh and that<br>that look that means you look at the<br>world slightly different to If you're<br>looking at a a short-term asset the<br>length of a business<br>case um so I would say that these um the<br>the strengths of<br>Partnerships they they are about a<br>marriage of<br>capabilities Mar land owners have have<br>the access um uh River in most cases has<br>been bringing the uh bringing the<br>capital and and the technical skill base<br>but it will say that there's also a<br>strong technical skill base uh that that<br>we generally try to utilize in terms of<br>our trusts as well um and that's around<br>understanding what their values are<br>understanding sustainable land use<br>helping with the rmaa resource<br>consenting process<br>Etc so just some of those uh you know<br>like all projects they never play in<br>sailing um land tenure is always a<br>challenge uh and it's um a challenge in<br>terms of multiple land ownership uh very<br>difficult to to make decisions uh very<br>difficult say to have governance<br>structures the right uh governance<br>structures in<br>process um there's there it's important<br>also to understand the role of ewi<br>versus land trusts so in other words um<br>The Wider ewi won't always have the same<br>uh the same view as a land trust and if<br>you don't if you don't understand that<br>subtlety uh you know you can fall into<br>some traps<br>uh I guess again Tanya made the point<br>that trustees tend to think<br>intergenerationally um and it's about<br>longterm Mana um not uh not as we would<br>look at it uh or tempting to look at it<br>in terms of the lifetime of a plant you<br>know geothermal 25 years um before you<br>start to have to replace all the kit um<br>but and that's where the Hydra I think<br>has been useful because those things are<br>enduring assets that are uh going to<br>outl all of<br>us I guess I'd make the point temps are<br>not always playing sing that history can<br>play a really big role where you're<br>dealing with more than one land trust<br>and with gfo development in particular<br>it's really important to get a good<br>footprint on the field obviously and<br>that can involve several land trusts and<br>it's not always um easy to get land<br>trusts to agree and history can play a<br>part in that um and that uh that history<br>may go back hundreds of years so you've<br>also got to bear that in mind and<br>sometimes you just won't get there and<br>those um I guess um just I was going to<br>to quickly uh look at some of the<br>projects but and I will just flick<br>through this quickly so that we've got a<br>bit of time for for questions and and<br>general discussion but we've already<br>talked about natam Riki that was<br>completed in uh 2013 that was our last<br>uh project and that started out with a<br>bold Vision between Mighty River and<br>tahara North more than a decade ago uh<br>when they secured the rights to access<br>to the gal resource um it's 100% owned<br>by Mighty rep power although toar North<br>receives a revenue stream and has an<br>option to take an equity stake and it's<br>back to my point before is it is it you<br>need to be flexible enough to build in<br>that that option of taking Equity uh<br>over<br>time so n r is the Final Chapter at the<br>moment uh in uh our geothermal current<br>program of geothermal development um and<br>I'm sure all of you are reasonably<br>familiar with the market at the moment<br>uh it's pretty flat demand has been very<br>flat so uh you're not seeing anything<br>being built uh at the moment and<br>obviously um that that relates to<br>geothermal wind Pro Ren prospects u a<br>bunch of stuff just sitting there in a<br>built so um just the the other ones that<br>uh that we have um I've talked about Oho<br>when go back coo um that one was<br>commissioned in 2008 it's again slightly<br>different model it's owned and operated<br>by m repair but it has Steam and land<br>land access Arrangements um so that's<br>not an equity Arrangement it is um it is<br>a um land access um and steam um with<br> trust um and some other land owners<br>and is quite a complicated um set of<br>land owners in the Caro area no pra uh<br>commission 2012 might River has 65% Tara<br>North number two has 35 with the option<br>so morai um that was the now we're<br>starting to get into some of the older<br>stations M acquired 2003 and expanded<br>and owned by tupaki power company now um<br>if if you haven't heard of uh tupaki<br>trust then um I really recommend you go<br>and Google them look at what they've<br>been doing uh and much of that has been<br>uh off the back of the gmal development<br>they are a a very Progressive uh very<br>sharp uh very commercially astute um<br>trust that has been uh has been growing<br>their assets they uh they have recently<br>brought uh MB Century um which is a a<br>drilling geothermal um um service<br>provider uh and they uh they have some<br>some greater assets uh that that they<br>built up over<br>time so just coming to the end of our<br>slides but uh one and the other on um on<br>on on profit for purpose and I guess<br>what we're trying to the point we trying<br>to make there is that um the returns<br>from these geothermal uh operations also<br>uh allow um some some great Investments<br>for the benefit um of land trusts and<br>the people so education Apprentice<br>programs leadership development um and<br>apprentiship programs is an interesting<br>one because we we have an apprenticeship<br>program as well in Mighty River and um<br>one of the things that I'm really keen<br>on doing is uh is bringing a lot of our<br>River e and geothermal uh I um youngah<br>through that process so ultimately they<br>will then finish up working for Mighty<br>River and uh and then you've uh you've<br>almost completed the full cycle of<br>partnership so what you've got uh is<br>you've then got uh in your own Senior<br>Management uh you will have your reu<br>partners embedded in your business uh<br>that'll help your decision- making uh<br>and it's moving that uh partnership to<br>the next<br>level so um couple of last slides just<br>look at a zoning out zooming out to a<br>high level now you can see geothermal is<br>now New Zealand's second fuel source<br>second largest fuel source 16% of<br>national Supply um and we're ranking<br>fourth or fifth in the world for<br>geothermal capacity terms of uh<br>Renewables just uh make the point that<br>uh we are in a really enviable position<br>Renewables wise so around 80% at the<br>moment of New Zealand's electricity<br>comes from renewable sources and if I<br>can just digress for a second you may<br>have seen us um with the take charge<br>initiative which is about uh converting<br>our Fleet to electric vehicles and I<br>guess the point behind that is uh is if<br>at the end of the day we can turn off<br>the pipe to the Middle East save a Sal<br>$4 billion um in uh in import fuel costs<br>and start running our our transport<br>fuels off our Renewables that' be a<br>great place to be um so look just um<br>last slide I had um before we open it up<br>is I just had a few just want to<br>summarize some of the key learnings when<br>I was thinking um this morning about<br>this presentation I guess just the first<br>one is developing generation projects<br>with e requires a commitment to<br>long-term and often personal<br>relationships so it has to be more than<br>business and it really has to um be as I<br>say it has to be a personal relationship<br>because what you do over time and it's<br>that point that Tanya made you know you<br>got to sit across the table and you've<br>got to you you've got to it's about<br>disclosure of your of your own personal<br>Integrity uh and and you really have to<br>lay that on the table and the second my<br>second bullet point is integrity is<br>everything when you're when you're<br>developing with e you have to follow<br>through on your commitments and if you<br>give your word keep it no matter what<br>the cost of doing<br>so third border Point I've got here is<br>environmental sustainability and it has<br>to be the Cornerstone uh of all of those<br>developments so successful developments<br>for us uh have been because uh they've<br>been sustainable renewable projects and<br>that is uh that is really strongly<br>aligned uh with e<br>values be prepared to be flexible with<br>your commercial arrangements and that<br>was my point before diag with the one<br>size fits all try to look for uh the<br>best solution for your partner and make<br>sure your partner has access to the best<br>legal and Commercial advice and this is<br>a this is this is a long-term<br>relationship and it's not about<br>outmaneuvering in the commercials which<br>is a point I made before it has to be<br>transparent last bullet point is you<br>won't always be successful at getting<br>the project underway but if you are<br>successful with the relationship the<br>chances are you'll get the next one out<br>of the blocks and if you don't you will<br>have some enduring personal friendships<br>uh and and they will last forever so</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
