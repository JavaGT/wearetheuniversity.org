have impact other<br>than extra public lecture on Tuesday<br>night Cindy bulik who is an American was<br>at University of Canterbury a decade or<br>more ago as visiting so she is doing an<br>additional public lecture on Tuesday<br>evening although at 6 o'clock<br>rather than 7 o'clock on eating<br>disorders but enough of advertising<br>tonight my privilege as Dean or

everybody<br>just briefly and my ignorant knowledge<br>that I come from a little village in<br>northern Hawke's Bay called new hacker<br>and I'd assume from the Nautica Hanna<br>new Irie<br>however I'm married and to nighta who<br>specifically are from Toa he from -<br>Hughie from the night I heard of him<br>hence the pita my name I which I was<br>young when I got married long story but<br>I have that name but they're very very<br>nice to me and I've read for them and<br>they kit they are very lovely to me and<br>I'm grateful to be here in acknowledge<br>them on the air on via Tokiwa and also<br>grateful for the introduction so thank<br>you Peter I wanted to start this evening<br>I know some of you but can you put up<br>your hand if you work in health is a<br>practitioner great if you want to be a<br>practitioner have promotion health<br>education great other ok we want this to<br>be an inclusive evening so I'm just<br>going to make sure that happens<br>also this is an a mystery novel oh this<br>is how I see the next hour playing out<br>tonight<br>firstly I'd like to give it quite<br>Kirra I floated for many many years with<br>one of my flatmates was from about took<br>Issei<br>and what I'd like to do this evening is<br>to gauge your expectations these nothing<br>worse than going to a Hui incoming<br>outgoing the one question I have they<br>never do so okay I'm going to do that in<br>a minute it's been just a really really<br>briefly a context on Maori health a<br>little bit about the genesis of the may<br>Hannah model which we don't write a lot<br>about and then just a little bit of an<br>overview of the whole process and the<br>main Hannah model own clinical practice<br>and then hopefully some time for<br>discussion Inc questions so I know some<br>people might be a little bit shy but if<br>you don't mind just yelling out as there<br>anything that if you went home tonight<br>and I didn't cover you would thank God<br>it was a waste of time going out on a<br>cold evening don't be shy cheerily yes<br>we employed a graphic adder so it looks<br>about fleshier<br>but the principles are the same so<br>effort the Beck I don't know if there<br>was any leaf but we have a 2014 edition<br>but if you didn't get it let me know and<br>I'll make sure that we email you a copy<br>kind of it's good anybody else I wonder<br>if these low expectation or no<br>expectation I'm a little bit nervous now<br>anything else that might cover it maybe<br>so in terms of the context of Marty<br>health I'm guessing that you came out on<br>a cold night because you know this graph<br>already that you know this graph talks<br>about in terms of life expectancy that<br>there's a difference between Maori and<br>non-maori and the in New Zealand and old<br>Tarawa<br>and part of our important role as health<br>practitioners as to adduce this<br>disparity and actually many of us got<br>into health because we wanted to help<br>the health of all New Zealanders<br>including Martine what I was am really<br>interesting as studying as a<br>psychologist at seven years and I found<br>it really fascinating that and my seven<br>years of training I had a total of what<br>I think was three hour one-hour lectures<br>on Maori health and they were nice and<br>they covered some really important<br>context I'm a little bit older so Mason<br>Durie was the only person writing about<br>Maori health as I was starting my<br>journey so many of you be familiar with<br>her fatty Tupper fire I see nods yes<br>that's good and what I thought was<br>really interesting is I wanted to make a<br>difference I came from a fan oh who<br>would hope I would contribute to Marty<br>health gain I studied really hard I did<br>very well at school and then I was super<br>excited to start my first job and I<br>thought I'm gonna bang out Marty house<br>I'm going to work for a mighty health<br>provider that's what I should do and I<br>worked both for my tea house providers<br>and mainstream but what if it was really<br>interesting is I want to talk about the<br>genesis of the Manhunter model really<br>quickly first and this and that is that<br>I said in front of one of my very first<br>patients she was 15 years old<br>she'd had a very very traumatic history<br>as a young child and enter her early<br>teenage years and as I said in front of<br>her I was so super excited I was yes<br>I've trained all these years for this<br>read all those articles wrote all those<br>essays this is my time<br>and I was wanting to shine and her first<br>comment to me was you're the tenth<br>therapist I've seen seriously what are<br>you going to do different and I knew<br>that that comment was specifically<br>targeted but I was actually the first<br>Maori clinician she had seen and as I<br>reflected on that I realized that it<br>solutely none of my training had<br>prepared me to fuse cultural or clinical<br>competencies together<br>so we'd learnt how to do introduce<br>ourselves how to connect through letter<br>FINA where and land but actually the<br>fusion of the two together was never<br>articulated in a way yet when I learned<br>how to do a as his someone for<br>depression or suicide risk or do any<br>other type of assessment I knew how to<br>do it because I'd been trained a<br>particular model but when it came to the<br>Marty Huff stuff I was all a little bit<br>this might not be politically correct<br>but it was a bit foggy and so I had<br>presumed that because I was Marty that<br>the minute I met Marty patients I would<br>instantly become the super Marty<br>psychologist and everything would just<br>use and it didn't and I was disappointed<br>and I thought jinx my parents just<br>wasted a hell of a lot of money because<br>I don't think I can do anything more<br>than what a more experienced clinician<br>could do so I got inquisitive and I<br>asked over 10 years this is but it was a<br>very long journey and the development of<br>the main Hana model but I interviewed<br>Maori Anant marty practitioners who<br>worked with maori patients because most<br>practitioners work with marty patients I<br>worked with I interviewed psychologists<br>had been in the game for over 30 years<br>doctors nurses and a lot of other types<br>of practitioners that I interviewed<br>including the advice around how did they<br>do it how did they get the fusion right<br>how does the actual cultural and<br>clinical competency happen together not<br>as an add-on and what really threw me is<br>it was still a little bit foggy and<br>people<br>developed some particular battery of<br>questions that they'd like to ask or<br>they'd found some ways that they could<br>navigate around cultural processes and<br>protocols especially around death and<br>there was some few really good tips but<br>I still couldn't quite get my head<br>around how do we know we're doing<br>anything different as either Maori or<br>non Marty clinicians because it's all<br>our role to contribute to Marty health<br>so if we're not doing anything different<br>than our predecessors why would this<br>change anytime in our working life<br>because I've worked with a key for many<br>years looking at heart disease heart<br>disease statistics have changed because<br>we do things differently we have new<br>technology we have new ways of scanning<br>we know about new hormones we understand<br>genetics a lot better so things are<br>changing but in terms of Maori health<br>the story the narration is changing a<br>little bit but not any significant way<br>so how do we change the narrative if<br>we're not doing anything different and<br>that's really was the genesis that young<br>fifteen-year-old girl many many years<br>ago it's really the genesis of the main<br>Hana model and it's about it's taken a<br>long time and a lot of colleagues to<br>work through this model and to be able<br>to go does it work and to test it<br>because I don't want anything to be<br>foggy when we're working with Maori<br>health that's true it's too critical<br>it's too fragile and if we hit we can<br>have the best intent but if we don't<br>have any measurable outcomes and nothing<br>will change and I think that that's kind<br>of the key point of where it came from<br>so really to encapsulate the whole may<br>Hana model what we did is we<br>internalized a very very complicated<br>situation which was what is currently<br>working in what's currently not working<br>and why isn't it working<br>there had been Marty practitioners a lot<br>longer than me the University of Otago<br>is very proud of today we hear away and<br>we've had been graduating Maori<br>clinicians for<br>over a hundred years we've been<br>graduating clinicians who've been<br>working with Maori for well over a<br>hundred years so what was missing and a<br>lot of Virginia says was that a lot of<br>people writing about Maori health<br>wundt are active practitioners or there<br>actually there was still room to grow a<br>move and I still think there is and<br>please trust me when I say the maheno<br>model isn't the answer to everything<br>what we're hoping that is as a starting<br>point to start a discussion about what<br>is best practice and how do we deliver<br>it and for me one of the biggest<br>concerns about if we don't make changes<br>are these things we have huge evidence<br>in New Zealand that there is that as<br>clinicians we have an impact on their<br>health and equality and this is<br>relatively new literature that's really<br>only been coming out in the last 10 to<br>15 years so before this we thought that<br>a lot of Maori health disparity existed<br>because of poverty we even then thought<br>that it was actually non and not<br>accessing primary care or other services<br>earlier but in the last five years we<br>have all the data that tells us that<br>Maori are accessing healthcare at<br>exactly the same rate as nan Marty and<br>in some particular age cohorts actually<br>at higher levels then on Marty so if<br>it's not about access to care it's about<br>quality of care now what makes me really<br>interested about this is I don't think<br>any of you wake up in the morning and go<br>you know my hot chocolate wasn't<br>fabulous I think I'll discriminate each<br>of my patients today I don't think<br>anyone wakes up and to that comment<br>we've all had really good intent but if<br>we're not sure how to impart that and<br>tint them to good clinical practice that<br>means we don't make as much of a<br>difference as we want to so I want to do<br>a big disclaimer though I think knowing<br>gets out of the bureau has debt bear to<br>here day their anchors there Tobias is<br>on their mind I think can we put up your<br>hand if you do all of your training had<br>more than 20 hours of training and Marty<br>health<br>more than 40 okay and so what I think is<br>really fun about doing this talk with<br>you tonight is though it's also a<br>pivotal time in our history to start<br>doing things a little bit different to a<br>hundred and seventy fifth year<br>anniversary of the signing of the Treaty<br>of Waitangi and I think it's a great<br>time to continue to make change and also<br>be a little bit reflective about why<br>things haven't worked as well as they<br>could have in the past and why I think<br>this is important is because I will be<br>so disappointed if I'm giving the same<br>lecture in 20 years time not because I'm<br>hoping to have early retirement but I<br>actually have learned that changing<br>Maori health is not a new science<br>it's amending the science we have and<br>knowing how to work with it a little bit<br>differently and I think sometimes we<br>become paralyzed and trying to help how<br>do we bridge multi health how do we<br>close that gap and it becomes because we<br>become so paralyzed we don't feel like<br>we can contribute to it as Maori or non<br>muddy and so I think it's really really<br>important that we don't get paralyzed<br>and we learn to ever shed language that<br>enables us to be critical of ourselves<br>in each other in a way that's helpful to<br>move forward and I think in doing that<br>it understands us we already know what<br>best practices I know very very well as<br>a clinician how to do a suicide risk<br>assessment what I've found in work I<br>know how to dwop the best screening is<br>for cardiovascular disease but actually<br>what I need to know more as what are the<br>barriers for Maori to access best<br>practice because there it seems to be<br>one of the key things we haven't looked<br>at so we're so busy focusing on we need<br>a whole new science to address this<br>where actually our research has shown us<br>we don't need a new science we need to<br>understand what the access and barrier<br>issues are to their access of good<br>quality care we also need to develop<br>toolkits they help us feel confident<br>because if we don't feel confident in<br>what we're doing we won't do it<br>I get my medical students to practice in<br>the mirror using Terrell because there's<br>a really big difference if I said to you<br>MIDI kyo midi then if I see Acura MIDI<br>and a lot of it comes down to practice<br>now that might seem so primary but we<br>may want to use to do but if we're not<br>practicing it it just can come out<br>really awkward and we can feel<br>embarrassed by it so there's a whole lot<br>of navigation that we have to do as<br>individuals to feel confident with using<br>the toolkit the next thing is<br>understanding the impact of public<br>health profiles on Marty patients what I<br>find fascinating is there is clinicians<br>we don't always do our homework when we<br>find out the patient is Marty so whether<br>we're looking at a patient presents with<br>early psychosis or whether they turn up<br>with asthma or pneumonia do we<br>understand what the public health<br>profile what the epidemiology looks like<br>for Marty within that area and does that<br>change our approach does it allow us to<br>access best practice quicker like I find<br>it quite interesting that when a Marty<br>child arrives either here at the<br>hospital and primary care with pneumonia<br>how often do our radars pricking go or<br>what's the epidemiology and how<br>different to retreat Marty children who<br>turn up with pneumonia when we<br>understand that the mortality rate for<br>Maori children is 10 times higher in New<br>Zealand for pneumonia than non-maori<br>children it does change the way you<br>practice and this might be a little bit<br>awkward to say or you'll find I don't<br>think anything's awkward but actually<br>it's how do we tailor things so we<br>actually treat people differently so we<br>can get the same outcome and there's a<br>huge difference between equality and<br>equity and how we tailor our practice to<br>that and the other thing that's become a<br>barrier of Marty health is actually<br>having a clear space to talk about Marty<br>house without having to talk about every<br>other health concern or every other<br>population or every other interest group<br>because actually every other interest<br>group deserves its own space I<br>refused to comment on Pacific health<br>because I am not only experience if ik<br>house I think it's for our Pacific<br>community to voice what they think is<br>right for them I think that we need to<br>feel comfortable that actually Maori<br>health is not taking all the space<br>there's a lot of space in house there's<br>a lot of meetings and health we can talk<br>about everything but it's actually<br>making a point to go actually we want to<br>address this inequity but also we want<br>to address indigenous health in our own<br>country regardless of iniquity and<br>actually just having a comfortable space<br>to talk about that as opposed to do you<br>know I know we're a now what does that<br>beter more convenient faster quicker<br>well they shouldn't have taken sudo if a<br>dream out of all the really good cold<br>and flu tablets but everything else is<br>supposed to be better and more efficient<br>but in doing that what we try and do is<br>fun things they hit more than one<br>population at a time but actually I<br>don't think that works very well in<br>terms of understanding all of the<br>complications around that so those of<br>you that picked up the papers at the<br>back just briefly the may Hannah model<br>sets in a context of two processes the<br>first is the Hui process the Hui process<br>distinctively as not doesn't belong to<br>the University of Otago it belongs to TR<br>Marty it belongs to the Maori world it's<br>always existed there and there is the<br>memory which is our introducing our name<br>in our role I don't know if it's just me<br>when I started as a therapist but you<br>sometimes we can forget the basics like<br>who we are what our name is why we view<br>what our particular Co Papa for that day<br>is in chicking we've got the right<br>patient and all the details in checking<br>ethnicity they're been triggers whether<br>we're entering the rest of the process<br>bukka for knowing a tonal although<br>somewhat complicated to say is different<br>than building rapport for no<br>Netanya is about building shared<br>connections based on aspects of TL Marty<br>whether it be far know whether<br>beefing or whether it be taking or<br>cultural processes or whether it be<br>about artwork which we define in the<br>papers like your personalized indicators<br>whether there's something about the<br>person they're using today or they've<br>got tiny rules on their t-shirt or a big<br>pony mow or time local things that<br>engage and kind of should set your radar<br>off go multi patience I'm going to get<br>culturally out there I you internalize<br>that you know let us set up out it makes<br>people feel awkward and then the next<br>section is ko pop art which is what<br>you're there for and that's where the<br>may Hana model first so I'm going to<br>talk about that in a minute and then the<br>portal portal are key or mu China<br>is the closing musician and then our<br>research what we've learned is this is<br>actually that were one of the aspects<br> for no Netanya and put upon rocky<br>are the ones they're actually the more<br>complicated to adapt some of our<br>processes to but portable rock is about<br>being really really clear what is the<br>next process for this patient or this<br>client going forward who's going to see<br>them next win is it what is that for<br>what is the purpose it is not different<br>overly differently what we should be<br>doing with all our patients but what is<br>different about it as it makes heaps of<br>suits intuitively to Marty patients<br>because it comes from the Marty<br>community and for knowing a toner<br>specifically is something that belongs<br>to the Maori community is innately tied<br>to Marty principles and I can answer<br>more questions about that later and so<br>this is the upgraded version middie of<br>the may hana model it's amazing what<br>happens when you purchase the services<br>of a graphic artist so I just want to<br>cut to the chase really quick on this so<br>and it's all in the latest paper in the<br>indeed MJ if you didn't get a copy let<br>me know and I'll flick you a copy via<br>email but working in marty house isn't<br>simple i thought was simple i think it<br>would have been fixed a hundred years<br>ago and so I want to draw you I always<br>find it easier to learn anything if I<br>have a picture or an analogy<br>your story and so the story of the main<br>Hanna model is about a waka hourua which<br>is a double-hulled canoe it holds all<br>the stories of how our early ancestors<br>migrated the whole of Polynesia and not<br>just to Altera but this is at the waka<br>hourua and itself represents a whole lot<br>of components of Maori history and you<br>will see that beer is on one hole we<br>have the patient and on the other hole<br>we have the farno for the main Hanna<br>model the fauna specifically relates to<br> Papa Fano so genealogically titled<br>biologically linked far no but also Co<br>Papa FOMO so support networks when I<br>worked in sexual health when I first<br>started out as a therapist I had a young<br>14 year old girl that came and in I said<br>you know next time you come back I'd<br>really like you to invite your far no<br>because I'd really like to meet them and<br>have a corridor with them surely it's<br>not a problem fire and so when she came<br>back the next week I had 15 14 year-olds<br>giggling in my office and I thought oh I<br>should have been more specific<br>but actually I didn't need to be more<br>specific in terms of sexual health and<br>14 year olds actually the abyss support<br>network are the appears and it was<br>really important for me to know that for<br>her because they were giving her various<br>different advice than what I was giving<br>so I needed to be able to bring that<br>whole support group onboard the walker<br>with me so that we were all going in the<br>same direction because we were pedaling<br>against each other a little bit for a<br>little while so it was a really<br>important thing to learn and in terms of<br>the echo or the beams going down these<br>are things that you would have learnt<br>already I want to be really clear that<br>the waka hourua isn't distinctively Mari<br>I think it's distinctively best practice<br>and it takes into a holistic approach<br>and I want to own that Mari and not the<br>only community in the whole world that<br>believe in a holistic approach but we do<br>like putting mighty words to it so hits<br>a hint this so in terms are starting<br>with the top okay Tina not loose ly<br>translated means and interaction thank<br>you<br>physical body Henning at all good<br>emotional and mental psychological<br>well-being why do i I'm gonna jump down<br>one a little bit<br>good spirituality and specifically in<br>the manor model we also talk about<br>connectedness so and what some<br>components are spiritual but somewhere<br>around connectedness and this might be<br>biased by my mental health background<br>but when you are doing a suicide risk<br>assessment when you're working with<br>young mums some really strong components<br>are what who are they connected to what<br>places are they can eat to to what<br>things are they can eat to to I reckon<br>Pediatrics here you know when a when a<br>tittie goes missing the whole world<br>collapses and to us that connection that<br>connectedness and understanding that<br>connectedness the understanding for me<br>of that young woman and who 14 14<br>year-old peers was really important<br>about understanding that component of<br>who connectedness to what and then and<br>the mayor and what are we add two more<br>there Anton here for eat up afar you<br>week our tour which talks about health<br>services so that's where we put house<br>services that the patient has exit has<br>had access to but also how services they<br>exist in our community and they don't<br>always align and the last one tile<br>refers to the physical environment that<br>the person not only lives in but also<br>the physical environment of our<br>facilities I love it when I used to work<br>in education and we'd say you can bring<br>as many Fano as you want but we would<br>have a room with two seats there it<br>seems a really really strong message<br>actually about how you're defining who<br>Fano are and so it's kind of<br>understanding our own physical<br>restraints and supports in our own<br>system but it also thinks about where do<br>they live how close is a good cheap<br>supermarket to where they live how often<br>do the buses run<br>what's that neighborhood like what's a<br>socio-economic area does it have good<br>school<br>so it's thinking broader about the<br>physical environment and it probably is<br>your first step of taku and to kind of<br>the broader components of the main Hanna<br>model which I really would like to spend<br>a bit more time on now what makes the<br>main Hanna model a little bit different<br>has come from years and years of<br>studying that my critique of past models<br>is that it just focuses on the waka<br>hourua it just focuses on the patient in<br>their family and on the odd occasion we<br>reflect a little bit about our services<br>and our interaction with them but what<br>this does is it doesn't recognize or<br>understand the impact of being<br>indigenous and the impact of being a<br>colonized community because you are<br>indigenous so when we look at Maori<br>health and we look at my health outcomes<br>and we detach it from indigeneity and<br>the experience of indigeneity we we must<br>have the puzzle of the half of the<br>puzzle and then we can't put it back<br>together and I think why there is is<br>because we feel uncomfortable and the<br>New Zealand education system does us no<br>favors and helping us embrace our<br>history now I studied lechon I've been<br>to France our colonial history is pretty<br>tame compared to some things that have<br>happened in other countries and so we<br>talk to either feel guilty about our<br>history or to feel justified in our<br>history as opposed to embracing that our<br>history is part of who we are today and<br>it's made us good and it's made us<br>difficult but it's made up us as a<br>community and I think the other thing I<br>always teach my students is that<br>colonisation isn't something personal<br>colonization if you look up the<br>definition of it as when an empire<br>conquers and out a place for the purpose<br>of gaining economic gain it wasn't to<br>upset my family or upset your family<br>there was a lot of early settlers here<br>that escaped England just imagine how<br>bummed out they were when the Queen<br>tuned up and put the same law<br>in place and they're on their big OE or<br>really disappointed we have a Viet we<br>have a complex due to simple history so<br>when I talk about the impact of<br>colonization what I'm talking about is<br>the impact of what happens to an<br>indigenous community when an empire<br>needs to use the resources to build gang<br>and it's very very different living in a<br>colony then living and a colonial empire<br>and I had this experience a couple of<br>years thanks to Peter letting me go of<br>standing in Paris at the Louvre and has<br>anyone been there or two to London yep<br>if you stand in Paris at the Louvre<br>not because you're really into Tom Hanks<br>movies and you saw The Da Vinci Code<br>but in terms of understanding the power<br>and the wealth that colonial empires<br>head and then you stand outside the<br>Beehive and you go there's quite a big<br>difference and the father in the<br>paintings inside a North Col either but<br>we have a different history but we have<br>a history that we need to embrace and<br>understand because it's our true context<br>and I don't think anyone needs to feel<br>guilty we need to feel educated and as<br>health practitioners we need to see that<br>we all can be agents of change and it<br>just says how we frame and understand<br>our position and match and so<br>particularly what we have added to the<br>model what the community has Edda to the<br>model there's two other key elements now<br>how we're far or the forwards and they<br>are and I'm going to start from the<br>singe colonization so the impact of<br>colonization now the impact of<br>colonization needs a little bit of<br>unpacking but one of the biggest<br>triggers or understandings about how<br>colonization manifests itself and 2015 I<br>was looking at the lack of inherited<br>wealth within a we in Maori communities<br>when you have a lack of inherited wealth<br>it means you're more likely to be<br>impoverished this wasn't just a unique<br>experience that happened for Marty it<br>also happened to the indigenous peoples<br>of Australia<br>Canada the u.s. Taiwan Hawaii and many<br>other communities there I'm sure you're<br>all aware of so it wasn't a unique<br>experience but what is interesting is<br>when you look at the health profile of<br>all those communities you see a similar<br>passion which is due to the lack of<br>inherited wealth which was due to loss<br>of land and so those things connect<br>really really tightly together<br>also within loss of land<br>there's also particular stereotyping<br>that happened from right from the early<br>crown that continues to happen that<br>makes people frightened or weary or back<br>particular racial stereotypes about<br>Marty and I think they are changing but<br>I think there's also a lot of evidence<br>that they still exist and of course<br>continual political reform that<br>continues to reshape and have a huge<br>influence on Marty health outcomes<br>whether it's changes to the health<br>reforms whether it's changing to who<br>gets state housing whether it's changing<br>to how we decide how housing loans are<br>done and whether school zones exist or<br>don't exist all impact Marty health<br>outcomes and so that's what I'm talking<br>about when I'm talking about<br>colonization I'm thinking about how we<br>we measure that today and how we work<br>through that and explore that with<br>individual patient experiences which you<br>can never start by saying so how does<br>colonization impacted your life that is<br>not the question but exploring the<br>elements of colonization are very<br>important the next one is<br>marginalization now marginalization is a<br>little bit deceptive<br>it doesn't mean have you ever felt<br>marginalized what it means is actually<br>as practitioners do we know the evidence<br>there helps us understand whether Maori<br>are marginalized in this particular<br>Fiori area I felt very excited that I<br>discovered that Marty weren't<br>marginalized and melanoma that actually<br>the rates were pretty good but then one<br>of my very close colleagues here said it<br>said to me mmm yeah but you know if you<br>get melanoma as a Marty it's going to be<br>like the worst kind and you probably<br>won't survive it<br>so that wasn't a happy story but you<br>know if you try and look for the silver<br>linings but it's about understanding<br>epidemiological profiles it's about<br>understanding readmission rates length<br>of bed States it's about understanding<br>all of the understanding art sorry it's<br>about measuring and understanding how to<br>measure iniquity and our trade the next<br>one is racism which of course is broken<br>up into three areas institutional racism<br>because sometimes we work within systems<br>that deliberately disadvantage<br>particular cohorts whether it's the<br>impoverished whether it's particular age<br>cohorts whether we've got criteria about<br>when you can have cardiovascular<br>interventions but it's highly wasted on<br>your age we then have interpersonal<br>racism where there's actually direct<br>face-to-face kernel heated to Colonel<br>here commentary that reinforces ratios<br>racial stereotypes are biased and then<br>these internalized racism which is when<br>our community or where Marty themselves<br>have internalized the institutional and<br>interpersonal racism and it's very hard<br>for them to not believe all of those<br>messages that are sent to them so racism<br>has three aspects and one of the<br>questions that I always ask is how has<br>been your how has been um sorry it's<br>late how has your experience been in our<br>service have you ever had an experience<br>in the house system we were made to feel<br>uncomfortable or you felt you were<br>treated differently because you were<br>Marty these are prep these are questions<br>you have to practice in front of the<br>mirror first but I think what I found in<br>the last 15 years of working at this med<br>school and working with students at<br>asking these questions is actually when<br>we have a really good relationship with<br>our Marty patients we have to be<br>prepared that they always don't say no<br>no I've been fine in some of the stories<br>that come out really challenged us and<br>to think about how we could improve our<br>health service delivery and how<br>sometimes it's just a personal thing<br>sometimes it's an institutional thing<br>but it can always be tailored and made<br>better<br>so racism is one<br>often we've avoided but actually if a<br>Marty patient has had a particular<br>experience that has has made them feel<br>that they can't engage in the health<br>system if we don't know that no matter<br>how we be nice and give them the right<br>drugs and get them the appointments the<br>times they want if we haven't navigated<br>that part of the choppy sea then<br>actually we'll never be able to fully<br>navigate them back to hold or well being<br>and so it takes a little bit of time and<br>practice that getting used to but I know<br>in terms of the research we've done it's<br>been a really interesting and liberating<br>experience for Marty patients to be able<br>to share particular experiences that<br>they've had and not that you need to fix<br>it but just that it's validated that<br>they got a little bit of a raw deal or a<br>huge ordeal or actually anyone else<br>would have gone to the health<br>commissioner over that and I think it's<br>just us having it on our radar that<br>actually everyone as in treated equal in<br>the system for a whole lot of reasons<br>and when I worked in adolescent<br>antenatal care<br>I saw it became cumulative not just<br>because they were young and pregnant but<br>young pregnant and Marty or during a<br>whole lot of other issues at a<br>particular Hospital not to be named that<br>I used to work it and then the last one<br>is understanding migration so this is a<br>migration from Hawaii beckon the later<br>there are a thousand ad this is<br>migration within New Zealand for<br>instance I am a migratory Marty I've<br>migrators from the beautiful warm<br>paradise of new hacker to the colder is<br>a Christchurch and so it's exploring<br>that it's exploring there and it's<br>really important for us as clinicians to<br>know about because you need to know<br>where as my support networks I've got<br>one of my colleagues at the back who<br>who's far know who's dared migrated<br>during the trade training times in the<br>nineteen sixties and seventies to<br>Christchurch and the heavy families have<br>stayed here Christchurch has a huge<br>history of trade training young men and<br>young woman coming to Christchurch and<br>staying here since the sixties and<br>seventies so although they are strongly<br>still affiliated with the e we the<br>children have been born and raised here<br>in Christchurch it's a very different<br>experience<br>it's around connection to fennel and<br>it's something that kind of helps us<br>understand the complexities of it and if<br>you ask me these questions you'd find<br>that all my phono are still in Hawke's<br>Bay but then you would find that I'm<br>married into a very large NATO - oh and<br>I have a large support network here so<br>who you would be connecting with and<br>working with would be very different<br>than my biological family that would all<br>be about my in-laws but migration helps<br>us explore there so embrace fits now<br>however I mean the thing about now Howie<br>far as it can show strengths and<br>weaknesses but we can use both to<br>navigate you know if you're on a walker<br>if you understand the wounds and how<br>they impact a patient if you understand<br>the ones of a boat it can help you learn<br>to navigate regardless of of those<br>wounds and the last component as Norma<br>Moana<br>or the ocean currents and we have four<br>ocean currents and the analogy and<br>luckily for me around Otero we have four<br>ocean currents as well so that's good so<br>I briefly discussed these so Neiderman<br>wanna comes from tamari their concepts<br>that come from the Maori world and their<br>concepts that as you learn about them<br>there will be a huge tool for you and<br>navigating in assisting Maori health<br>outcomes they'll help you to get what's<br>important to the patient and so I've<br>already talked about our so personalised<br>indicators fina well so understanding<br>connection to land where they come from<br>where they see they come from which<br>might not be where they love it all<br>might also might be what takes them back<br>to Hawke's Bay like me what take is<br>asking questions like what takes you<br>back how often do you go back now this<br>becomes exceptionally important when<br>we're working in palliative care and all<br>of a sudden Fano to nap from Hawke's Bay<br>and say we want the body tomorrow and<br>were like oh we hadn't thought to ask<br>about that and actually we probably<br>can't get your Topsy down in that time<br>so it allows things to be predictive as<br>a clinician it allows things for us we<br>know how to<br>things up before it gets too late it<br>helps us understand things if a young<br>man wants to take the fennel home in a<br>we understand that Finn or is upper<br>Northland not it all here in<br>Christchurch it changes the way that we<br>may give advice about how to look after<br>the fennel<br>until it was planted in the fennel the<br>next one of course is far know now the<br>funnel and the Walker is around<br>collateral history and under sustaining<br>support networks the far know an aroma<br>Moana is about understanding the roles<br>and responsibilities of farno so what is<br>the roles and responsibilities and the<br>Fano of your particular patient<br>are they the oldest do they have<br>particular while they were younger and<br>do they have particular roles and<br>responsibilities I have worked with a<br>lot of Maori woman over the age of 50<br>and one of the key concerns is that if<br>the health care intervention takes too<br>long<br>their primary role as caregiver over the<br>mokopuna after school as impinge on so<br>actually changing appointment times to<br>during school times work so much better<br>then trying to set them up for four<br>o'clock appointments a really really<br>simple thing to do if you're really nice<br>to the administrative staff but really<br>really practical but often will must<br>that role if we haven't investigated<br>farno properly and not Ouma mana or why<br>they need to get somewhere because of<br>their roles and responsibilities with um<br>the phone oh and the last one is around<br>takuna again it's tricky like<br>colonisation you can't say so how is<br>your tea color today could we do<br>anything else to make your tea hang of<br>it it's a it's way more complicated than<br>there and there's clinicians we have to<br>be a little bit more savvy and have a<br>few more tools to hand out but and I'm<br>afraid that the question at the hospital<br>I find complicated hick does not here so<br>I'm good<br>the question that we ask are you do you<br>have any cultural<br>what's the question like do you have any<br>cultural things you'd like us to be<br>considerate of as a very complicated<br>question because it's a default question<br>what it's saying is we have our culture<br>here within the hospital within our<br>general practice or within our mental<br>health services are you different than<br>us and I what happens of course is 99.5<br>percent of the time patients will go no<br>because no one wants to be of it<br>so so I so navigating Tekoa is very is<br>actually not as how did you think but we<br>need to do it but you know understanding<br>TK now helps so we have had a patient<br>here in Christchurch Hospital who<br>stopped eating his Chi and it took a<br>miracle student to work out the issue<br>was T Connor when he was asked is there<br>anything no no no but actually it was<br>taken out because he was unable to go to<br>the toilet physically himself and their<br>little porta potty as I like to call<br>them keep being placed on the high table<br>and for this particular patient they're<br>really conflicted with his own ticker<br>and so he wouldn't eat you know as soon<br>as we rectified that there was not a<br>problem in the house system it was<br>something so simple and I know that you<br>would think that there happened in 1995<br>but it actually happened two years ago<br>so there are still things that we need<br>to be reminded of now the other just<br>short disclaimer the thing that makes<br>the may Hana model a little bit more<br>complex as it is not a cultural<br>checklist it is not a cultural checklist<br>that says middie let's see how Maori<br>media is so we'll try our out on this<br>I'm just using MIDI because I know the<br>the thing that pushes you as a clinician<br>why this is designed for clinicians and<br>for those working in health is because<br>of the law of individual differences<br>every patient as themselves if the<br>patient happens to be Marty is as<br>understanding what is the ER experience<br>of these things in tailoring our<br>approach to them based on us<br>and for some patients they need to know<br>you for a little while before they will<br>disclose all of these things and for<br>other patients you ask the right<br>questions and bang it comes out for some<br>patients the bodily fluid on the Chi<br>table is a huge issue for others it is<br>not it doesn't make them more or less<br>Marty it doesn't make us a better or<br>worse clinician what makes us a good<br>clinician is that we know what the<br>patient wants and how to tailor it for<br>them<br>that's why I've found the main Hana<br>model to be so successful that's why my<br>T patients love it because it treats<br>them as an individual Marty patient as<br>opposed to a Marty patient that must<br>speak today or that must go to the MRI<br>and cook a hangy inswing poised every<br>Saturday<br>it takes all that away and it's based on<br>reality and diverse realities within our<br>community now the other thing is about<br>the main Hana model and this is just a<br>quick guide at what our students get<br>they get a pocket guide and what we do<br>is we take how we would usually take a<br>biomechanical history and we've infused<br>the Mae Hannah model and to it because<br>if I had to do a suicide depression I<br>said sorry if I had to do a suicide risk<br>assessment or a depression inventory and<br>then you wanted me to triple my work by<br>the in putting in a cultural assessment<br>I would find it really hard to do but if<br>it's infused in our normal practice it<br>is way more sustainable if we know I'm<br>gonna ask when I'm doing a suicide risk<br>assessment I'm gonna ask this this and<br>then I'm gonna bring him to color and<br>I'm going to ask around dips and their<br>issue and I'm going to explore this<br>component of white aura and then I'm<br>going to ask about fina WA and their<br>connectedness and then I'm going to<br>understand this but it just helps us to<br>make a more comprehensive assessment<br>that is tailored to the mighty patient<br>as opposed to I'm going to do the Reno's<br>Depression Inventory here Park now I'm<br>going to ask you all about Chihuahua and<br>your colonization here because if you<br>can't fuse them it's of no use<br>right an assessment must bring together<br>the evidence<br>and then draw on that to make a really<br>good management plan it can't be done if<br>they sit in isolation and it can't be<br>done if you're not clear what you're<br>supposed to be asking about and so<br>that's the four for our medical students<br>we work with them so it's not rigged on<br>there but you'll see this is how they<br>take a history medical students are<br>taught using the Calgary Cambridge model<br>and we infuse and which components of<br>the Calgary Cambridge model they can ask<br>these questions where do they certain<br>was naturally and I think that really<br>this isn't just for medical students I<br>know this week's were psychologists and<br>I think it should weeks with anyone<br>working in health whether it's health<br>education health promotional or as<br>health practitioners and I think what I<br>hope it does and our research has showed<br>that it demystifies how to be a good<br>clinician was Marty and what it does is<br>it enables us to guide our own<br>professional development you know my<br>patient used this they pulled up this<br>with me I've never heard of that before<br>who can I go to to ask about that<br>because you know we teach our students<br>that our Marty patients here in<br>Christchurch tend to use forty to forty<br>five to their words most commonly so if<br>a Marty patient uses a word you don't<br>know ask them what it means it's great<br>professional development because it's<br>highly likely in your career another<br>mighty patient will use that word and<br>you don't have to ask them what it means<br>you'll already know and so that happens<br>and all these components of the manner<br>model and what I've liked about it has<br>given us a shared language as Marty<br>clinicians as non-motor clinician to use<br>it working with our marty health workers<br>we're not talking past each other we use<br>in the same language with Marty patients<br>with students it's given us a shared<br>language be able to critically appraise<br>what are we doing different and what I<br>found really interesting in my PhD is<br>well I thought I wanted to do as if I<br>got all my students culturally competent<br>what that would mean is that model<br>patients would all get really good drugs<br>you know appropriate for the condition<br>there is my goal but as I interviewed my<br>early patients and as I continue to<br>umeri patients over the last 15 years<br>what I'm finding is not just our<br>students but also our staff that have<br>engaged in this work and Junior with us<br>is what I'm finding is that patients are<br>reporting a change in their experience<br>and the house system the drug are<br>measuring the drugs later but I've<br>realized I missed the point that<br>actually the drugs are important and<br>interesting very hard method to measure<br>but what has been more important at the<br>moment for our Maori community is that<br>when they come into hospital there's a<br>whole lot of things that are going<br>better for them in terms of their<br>experience there's a whole lot of things<br>that people are getting that they don't<br>have to explain so much all that are<br>normalized oh you're going to a tummy<br>we're about to the tummy<br>have you been to that matter before how<br>are you going to get there is any of<br>your other funny members going there<br>they're able to have conversations that<br>normalize and that validate them as<br>being Maori within our hospital sitting<br>and they're loving it they're loving it<br>to the point that they feel welcome here<br>and because they're loving it they're<br>disclosing more issues around their<br>health which are then making it easier<br>for our clinicians to do better<br>management and so while it's triggering<br>is a change of experience which in South<br>it's really really key because it used<br>to be a place where you had to almost<br>pretend to not be Marty if you wanted<br>good services and now it's really<br>changing to be a place where it's okay<br>to be Maori and it's really really nice<br>to have a whole lot of people get you<br>because you're Marty are there any<br>questions<br>okay so and brief how we train our<br>students to do this is actually we use a<br>lot of simulation and this is actually<br>we need this is one of our simulation<br>sessions that happened last year so we<br>actually practiced and I know for the<br>psych students in the room we've got to<br>role plays which I know everyone doesn't<br>like but it's you a great way of<br>learning about how to do the who'ii<br>process how to do the Manhunter model<br>how to ask questions about racism how to<br>explore colonization because they're<br>easier we may catch for them the easier<br>we handed out just like I was handed out<br>how to do a Depression Inventory the<br>easier we formulations like that the way<br>more likely students are to transform it<br>into their clinical practice and I think<br>coming back to my training that was the<br>biggest issue we got lectured about<br>marty health but no one demonstrated how<br>to do it how to do it differently and<br>one was really researching at that time<br>did it make a difference to patients or<br>did it alienate them did it make a<br>difference whether you're a mighty<br>clinician or not a Marty clinician and<br>I've worked out with my colleagues over<br>the years that actually the may Hannah<br>model works regardless of whether you're<br>Marty or non Marty it's actually<br>designed for both because we both work<br>in the same health environment so if we<br>can't share the same skills in<br>experiences then it marginalizes Marty<br>patients all over again so we do<br>simulation then we take them and true<br>either a home that I we've done how<br>screenings in the past and some of you<br>have attended and the recent last couple<br>of years we've been so grateful to the<br>local could have hope upper who have<br>opened their doors and it's a great<br>thing to watch our medical students<br>speak to do and do clinical exams<br>they're all really nervous on the day<br>and have lots a little britain<br>handwritten words on their bed which is<br>awesome<br>and in just last week<br>we were able to take our students and<br>put them and true<br>Tamati tony at the kapa haka festival<br>and actually get them in having them<br>volunteer to give up time during the<br>weekend to come and support the<br>screening and to put the cultural<br>competencies<br>I think one of our rule practice without<br>me examining them and of course they do<br>it in real practice anyway on the wards<br>because they have to interview my early<br>patients for their assignments but this<br>was a no-pressure offer and what I loved<br>is at the end of during 400 patients the<br>students one was still talking to me in<br>- I loved one of the comments where now<br>I get it and being able to put them in<br>context because another issue is putting<br>them in a context where they can<br>practice and see because Maori patients<br>naturally reinforce them when they do<br>the Mahana model because mari patients<br>get it because it's from TL Mahdi it's<br>not from Sue's it's not from my buddies<br>it's not from folks it's from a Maori<br>community we've just had the pleasure<br>and the privilege of being able to<br>package it in a way there helps us as<br>clinicians navigate a bit a pathway for<br>there was time for a few questions<br>comments for Sue's yes you can do it in<br>ten minutes when you get good because<br>our students have to do it in ten<br>minutes by the end of fifth year for an<br>auskey okay okay um it takes practice<br>but it also takes learning how to how to<br>flag what's important for the patient so<br>not all of the components of the main<br>Hanna model are important for the<br>patient all of the time or for the<br>particular presenting complaint for<br>instance if they've come in with acute<br>asthma they want medication really<br>really quickly and so for that<br>particular thing they may just be a few<br>things that you're pulling on so it's<br>working on which ones when you have it<br>though long when you get to see them<br>more often it's about building your<br>understanding of these things and I know<br>one of my colleagues had a her as a GP<br>had a patient between two years and then<br>he started getting game to ask a few of<br>these questions and he said it was like<br>he didn't know the patient but it didn't<br>take him long and it was just asking a<br>few questions each visit to widen his<br>own understanding of the patient and<br>when they're presenting complaint so I<br>think I agree it does take longer nature<br>it takes long to get it right but<br>actually it does it but once we get it<br>right we can do it relatively quickly<br>yep and we are going to soon have<br>available online where you can watch<br>some of our students do it and the ten<br>minutes time so so you don't think I'm<br>kidding that it can actually be done<br>it's so much nice and not being a GP I<br>get a whole hour so nice Peter<br>I had to work on the constraints of a<br>mid school which is actually really<br>taught me that actually it can be done<br>that quickly and some of my colleagues I<br>tell you it can even be done in a two<br>minute screening at much to me when you<br>learn to out how to ask the questions<br>yeah kya oh yes so they get introduced<br>to it when they start here at the<br>beginning of fourth year and they're<br>quite fluid edit within the first couple<br>of months but by the end of first year<br>they can they have an auskey in August<br>so they have a exam where they interview<br>a Marta patient in front of us and in<br>two minutes they cover each of the<br>elements yeah you can chase them out so<br>I don't really like the way yeah yeah<br>yeah and we have we've been trying to<br>work with some of our other health<br>colleagues so that they can be a shared<br>language like my perfect dream would be<br>Megan being and the birthing suite and<br>the Midwife and the house surgeon in the<br>mid student in the registrar or<br>understood the same language together<br>when thinking about a model patient in<br>Yvonne I mean I know that so out there<br>but wouldn't it be fabulous one more<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
