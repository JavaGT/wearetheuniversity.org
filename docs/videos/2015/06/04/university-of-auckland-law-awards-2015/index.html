Awards you've<br>done well and the members of the faculty<br>here tonight join me in congratulating<br>you I'd like to welcome your family and<br>close friends who are able to be here<br>this evening our students here tonight<br>wouldn't have achieved their success<br>without your support your encouragement<br>and your love you can be very proud of<br>all they've achieved and in knowing that<br>you made and you helped make their<br>success as possible I'd like to welcome<br>many of the individuals and<br>representatives of firms and<br>organizations who've donated prizes and<br>scholarships for our best students<br>who've supported our student societies<br>and the events and the competitions they<br>organized and have given financial<br>assistance to the law school and what we<br>are trying to achieve we are immensely<br>grateful the prizes scholarships and<br>donations that you provide mean a lot to<br>our students they recognize their hard<br>work the hours spent in libraries<br>staying up late before exams seeking to<br>master particular cases legal principles<br>and areas of the law this is a very<br>successful law school we are very proud<br>of our students and we are very grateful<br>for the support that many of you here<br>tonight have given i'd like to welcome<br>members of the legal profession and the<br>Judiciary here were here tonight we have<br>judges who have satin or are currently<br>sitting in the district court the High<br>Court the core<br>to appeal and the Supreme Court and I<br>thank you for being able to attend we're<br>very grateful for the support provided<br>to us not only in financial terms but<br>also by helping and mentoring students<br>adjudicating boots and competitions and<br>supporting student and faculty<br>activities we have two young lawyers<br>here tonight to apprise in scholarship<br>winners a few years ago and I'm pleased<br>to welcome Hamish McQueen and Benedict<br>Tompkins who have both recently been<br>offered full scholarships for most<br>graduate study at Harvard Cambridge and<br>Oxford and now face the difficult choice<br>of deciding which of those quite good<br>universities to attend we have another<br>student who's unable to be here tonight<br>Finn Lowry who's currently traveling in<br>India but as going to Oxford later this<br>year on a Rhodes Scholarship he's the<br>food auckland law student in the last<br>four years to win a Rhodes Scholarship<br>which means that this one law school has<br>in fact when a quarter of all rhodes<br>scholarships awarded a new zealand<br>during that time this year as well as<br>himesh benedict and Finn going off to<br>pursue postgraduate law we have other<br>Lachlan law graduates going to study at<br>the universities of Toronto New York<br>University Pennsylvania Cornell Harvard<br>light and Cambridge Oxford London School<br>of Economics among others and I'm very<br>sure that some of the students receiving<br>awards here tonight we'll also do<br>incredibly well continue to do<br>incredibly well and have those same<br>opportunities in due course the format<br>of tonight's award ceremonies will be<br>that will present the awards in the<br>groups that are laid down in the program<br>so I will ask each group in turn to come<br>up and to line up on the left hand side<br>of the stage here in the order of the<br>program that their names are written<br>when I call your name if you come<br>forward and I suppose that's a chance<br>once I've called the name for people to<br>recognize the achievement by applauding<br>or hooting or singing or whatever else<br>you want to do but recognize the<br>achievement as the person comes up I<br>will shake the recipients hand and at<br>that point if you then go on to the<br>associate dean eka dear<br>back Stevan pink who will present the<br>certificate but then if you could stay<br>on the right-hand side of the stage and<br>so if everyone that group could stay and<br>then at the end of that particular group<br>we would do a group photograph so that<br>you have something for posterity to<br>remember this grand and illustrious<br>occasion and to prove that issue really<br>did get an award so so wait in the group<br>as I say we'll take the group photograph<br>as well as it's another occasion to<br>recognize the achievements of that<br>particular group and as you exit<br>remembering that there are several<br>steers to walk down so not having had<br>too much of the wine that's provided at<br>the table in order to achieve that<br>relatively simple task at the end but<br>once you walk down you will see that<br>there are copies of emeritus professor<br>brian koontz book lewnard in the law<br>which has a history of the auckland law<br>school laid out on the table on the<br>other side of the stage and if you<br>haven't already got a copy you're very<br>welcome to take a copy of the law school<br>history with you as you leave you're not<br>to take multiple copies and sell them<br>because we are in fact giving them away<br>for free which means is probably not a<br>great market there while we all want to<br>know the history of the auckland law<br>school the average member of the public<br>is not yet so enlightened is to wish to<br>do the same i'd ask the students who in<br>the program as student leaders and to<br>please come forward and to line up on<br>the left-hand side of the stage at this<br>point this part of the program is really<br>thanking those those students who<br>volunteered and been elected to take<br>leadership in all sorts of areas around<br>the law school so i'll be thanking some<br>of the executive members of the auckland<br>university law student society which is<br>one of the most active and successful<br>law societies in the country it<br>organizes a wide range of competitions<br>seminars workshops drink I mean sporting<br>social events i'll also be recognizing<br>the presidents of turaco Tory are Mary<br>Law Students Association which provides<br>a very real sense of community and<br>support for our Maori law students just<br>to give one example every year they<br>organise an annual higher<br>are two schools in different parts of<br>the north ireland and fusing and<br>informing a whole lot of school pupils<br>about why they might want to come and<br>study law and to come to university I'll<br>be recognizing the leaders of the<br>Pacific island Law Students Association<br>who provide community and support for<br>our Pacific island students and again<br>just one example of the work they do um<br>each year we send around a dozen<br>students dozen of our Pacific students<br>to present research at an academic<br>conference over season last year about a<br>dozen Pacific island law students went<br>to an academic conference of the<br>National University of Samoa and will be<br>recognizing the leaders of rainbow law<br>which provides community and support for<br>our lesbian gay bisexual and transgender<br>students this was a group officially<br>launched last year by Justice Michael<br>Kirby one of Australia's beer snow and<br>judges will be recognizing the directors<br>of the equal justice project which over<br>the years has involved many hundreds of<br>our students providing free legal<br>assistance to individuals and<br>organizations in partnership with<br>community groups and the legal<br>profession the editors or the editors in<br>chief of the Auckland University Law<br>Review we recognize this as an entirely<br>student-run law journal and the amount<br>of work they do reading editing and<br>publishing a high quality journal all<br>around their academic studies is<br>incredibly significant and well done<br>will also be recognizing the leaders of<br>the other law review so this isn't the<br>one that involves the prestige journal<br>coming out this is the one where a large<br>number of students take to the stage<br>every year to sing dance satire and<br>LuPone various aspects of the law and<br>society and I saw that from one of their<br>recent shows one of their video clips<br>got two million downloads on YouTube and<br>I imagine that's probably more impact<br>than most academics at the loss who<br>can't quite claim that 22 million people<br>read their esteem writing so again a<br>good way of promoting some aspects of<br>law school and finally will be<br>recognizing the leaders of the mooting<br>Society this was established two years<br>ago to encourage and promote mooting at<br>all levels it has<br>hundred and fifty law students have<br>joined it this year it set up a new<br>competition last year the John Hague<br>memorial moot for food and fourth-year<br>students which attracted 32 teams this<br>year it's out to establish a new<br>competition for first-year students for<br>which the naming rights i may say are<br>still available we have one of our<br>student leaders unable to join us Connie<br>Bolin the competition's officer and a<br>director of the singing and dancing law<br>review but would you please congratulate<br>and thank our lost unit society<br>president Ben Kirkpatrick the law<br>student society administrative vice<br>president Rebecca bremner one of the<br>educational vice presidents of the law<br>student society Nick Fenton the

examination in<br>negotiation in client interviewing and<br>mooting mooting for those of you who<br>haven't come across it before is a mock<br>court case on a point of law so in some<br>ways it's the closest experience to<br>appearing in court to add you a legal<br>issue and we have quite a number of<br>mooting competitions as a result I'd<br>like to very much fake the loss law<br>firms who sponsor these competitions and<br>who support the costs of sending the law<br>school students who have won the<br>internal law school competitions and who<br>the law firms who pay the costs

student<br>competitions last year so again won the<br>shield for the top law school at their<br>event which is a real tribute I think to<br>the teams and the competitors but also<br>it's a tribute to the help that is given<br>and the assistance that's given by so<br>many practitioners judges and mediators<br>in judging practice rounds and helping<br>coach the teams that go through to<br>national and international competitions<br>I'd like to first congratulate the law<br>students who won they won the global<br>microfinance case competition in<br>Melbourne against 110 other teams Daniel<br>hearing is absent but please<br>congratulate firstly Richard Belcher and<br>also look strong the next two students<br>were the Auckland lost will<br>representatives in the red cross asia<br>pacific international humanitarian law<br>booting competition they were coached by<br>trust dunworth and they ended up the<br>runners-up in that competition so<br>and Jake dailies the Philip Jessup<br>international law moot competition is<br>held in washington DC each year and<br>Auckland has won the right to represent<br>New Zealand of that competition for<br>seven of the last eight years and to win<br>that right you have to win the new<br>zealand law mooting competition first<br>there were 200 teams at this year's<br>Jessup international law competition our<br>team ended up ranked in the top 25% and<br>two of the team members were ranked<br>among the top 100 of slightly more than<br>2,000 speakers in the final rounds in<br>Washington GCC I'd like to very much<br>thank the New Zealand law foundation for<br>funding the team but could we<br>and Aidan Lomas silly whoo was another<br>member of the team unable to be here and<br>the team was coached by Carolyn foster<br>and a hood and Isaac a carcass are very<br>much like to thank them the last of the<br>representative teams I'd like to<br>congratulate tonight are the is the team<br>that represented us in the wilhelm this<br>Smoot for commercial arbitration and<br>that moot was held in Vienna and like<br>the Jessup team they had to put in<br>months of work to for the written<br>memorials beforehand practice rounds and<br>then traveling overseas I mean it's the<br>hard part of it going to Vienna to<br>compete again against around 2,000<br>students from about 300 universities our<br>team reached the elimination rounds<br>which means they were ranked in the top<br>32 and two of the team members were<br>ranked in the top 50 speakers of around<br>those two thousand speakers competing<br>they also for the Miss Teen there's a<br>whole lot of pre moots where you go and<br>warm up a few light for the verse smooth<br>itself it sounds like a really good deal<br>to me because some our team went to<br>several continents for pre boots and<br>they actually won the prix moots in<br>budapest in romania and reach the finals<br>of the pre moots in shanghai Heidelberg<br>and Brussels so in fact they either<br>reach the finals or one most of the pre<br>moots that they took pattern but little<br>is a great achievement and doubtlessly a<br>great trip i'd like to think not only<br>the law faculty for funding the team but<br>the business school which also<br>contributed minter ellison the Auckland<br>District Law Society you can see where<br>we need so many sponsors for a trip of<br>this nature bankside chambers shortland<br>chambers for all of their contributions<br>to the team being able to take part and<br>do to do so well as they do because we<br>jake davies oh really here Jake as you<br>can see as a mooting phonetic although I<br>think he wins a few prizes later so he<br>obviously doesn't negate the studies<br>either Michael grid up and I Leonard and<br>a moment we have one member as i<br>mentioned Finn Lowry who's the student I<br>mentioned early who's won the rhodes<br>scholarship to Oxford but he continued<br>trebling after this so he's still in<br>India at the moment but as the coaches<br>and they did an incredible amount of<br>work with this team if we could think<br>Thomas Clark Campbell Herbert and the<br>with the winners of the new entrant<br>prizes please come to the stage the the<br>winners of the new enterprises all<br>receive a book token and I've just look<br>we've forgotten to bring the book tokens<br>with us so apologies for there and that<br>you will you will receive the book<br>tokens and be able to buy you know<br>Stephen Todd's new book on legal method<br>or one of the other great academic works<br>that have been published by our faculty<br>these awards are given to school leavers<br>and they are incredibly competitive<br>because all the school leavers applying<br>to come to this law school are eligible<br>to apply and given that we have around<br>1,400 students who do first year law you<br>can imagine that to win one of these 24<br>prizes or one of the nine new entrant<br>scholarships these are students have<br>done incredibly well indeed so can we<br>Ellis Buckley doosan Diane nike Patricia<br>Ferreira Tina few dire guessin Alexia<br>Grindle Alicia imran Elise Johnson kate<br>kennedy<br>Lena lower daniel meyer gate georgia<br>Osmond Penelope ping day at you Jesse<br>ray Romina Selanne Lucy very and when<br>and with the recipients of the new<br>entrance scholarships please come up to<br>the stage as I mentioned there are 24<br>new entrant prizes there are nine new<br>entrant scholarships these are worth a<br>thousand dollars each and the students<br>have achieved them have had to get<br>really stellar results at school so<br>certainly I hope the scholarships will<br>encourage them to continue to do well as<br>I mentioned we saddle for around 1,400<br>students at first year law but then we<br>moved to only 330 students at second<br>year law so really all of our students<br>who come through have to be very high<br>achieving but it does mean that are<br>these students hopefully we'll have a<br>fairly good chance of continuing their<br>academic success into the future would<br>Elizabeth Casper babish compare daya an<br>genet a fill 10 Walsh and again from our<br>lineup of our top new scholars I'd<br>expect we're going to have a pic of a<br>lot of female judges and female more<br>partners into the future for our guest<br>speaker tonight I'm very pleased to be<br>able to introduce professor Ron Peterson<br>who not only is the Ombudsman but just<br>as importantly as a professor of this<br>law school professor Patterson has a<br>postgraduate law degree from the<br>University of Oxford but he first<br>studied law here at the Auckland law<br>school he was a person who just like the<br>students tonight was presented with<br>prizes and scholarships not least he<br>shared the prize for the top<br>undergraduate student of his year with<br>Mike Taggart who also went on to be a<br>professor here ron has combined his<br>academic career with public service he<br>spent 10 years as New Zealand's health<br>and disability Commissioner and made an<br>enormous impact on healthcare quality<br>the regulation of the health care<br>professions something of vital<br>importance for all of us he is the<br>co-editor of the leading text medical<br>law in New Zealand and he also wrote<br>when he stepped down as the health and<br>disability Commissioner he wrote his<br>book the good doctor what patients want<br>because of his concern to make the law<br>and the legal issues he deals with<br>accessible to the public and to bring<br>about change that would not only benefit<br>the medical profession the hospitals but<br>also the patients and ultimately all of<br>us ron has now been the Ombudsman for<br>almost two years during which time he's<br>been doing the same in this role the<br>essence of which of course is to<br>investigate complaints brought by<br>members of the public against government<br>departments and agencies including<br>health boards schools and even<br>universities it's a role in which the<br>Ombudsman is charged to look out for the<br>public and to speak out for the public<br>and we are so very proud that one of our<br>own law professors is holding that role<br>on behalf of all of us would you please<br>welcome professor Ron person nami yamaha<br>nakia Akutagawa talofa lava dean<br>Stockley award winners family friends<br>colleagues from the law school and the<br>profession it's my privilege to offer a<br>few reflections as we celebrate the<br>achievements of the top auckland law<br>students for 2014 first let me add my<br>congratulations to the prize and<br>scholarship recipients the mooting and<br>competition winners the student leaders<br>gathered here tonight well done on your<br>award for most of us prizes do not come<br>easily they are the culmination of a lot<br>of hard work and determination take a<br>moment tonight to end in the days ahead<br>to thank the family and friends who<br>supported and encouraged you on you<br>through your studies to the lecturer the<br>supervisor the tutor the mentor who went<br>the extra mile your success is also a<br>tribute to their efforts last weekend I<br>dug out the law school handbook the 1978<br>listing the 25 Award winners for 1977<br>my final year as a student all that<br>happened was that there was a there was<br>a page at the back of a handbook and a<br>twenty-dollar chicken them out far<br>grander occasion that tonight couple of<br>things struck me not least the absence<br>of any Maori Pacific or Asian names some<br>scholars on that list were clearly<br>destined for great things notably my<br>good friend might tagger who later won<br>the Cleary memorial prize for the person<br>admitted as a barrister and solicitor<br>who showed the most promise of service<br>to the New Zealand legal profession Mike<br>was the outstanding law graduate of our<br>generation he described himself as a<br>simple common lawyer he became an<br>internationally renowned administrative<br>lawyer and a much-loved Dean teacher<br>colleague and friend to so many of us<br>other classmates did not appear in the<br>1977 Awards lyst yet they were destined<br>to make significant contributions to the<br>legal profession and to public service I<br>think of Dale Clarkson the first of our<br>year to be appointed a judge in 1989<br>Billy ten years out of Law School<br>District Court Judge family court judge<br>and now chair of the lawyers and<br>conveyancers disciplinary tribunal<br>before which I hope none of our prize<br>winners will ever appear mark Cooper<br>environmental lawyer and now judge a<br>judge of the Court of Appeal end of<br>course the chair of the Canterbury<br>earthquakes Royal Commission Paul Heath<br>and solvency lawyer and High Court judge<br>and Cheryl Gwen inspector general of<br>intelligence and security after a<br>distinguished career at the crown law<br>office I doubt that many of my<br>classmates had a smooth and steady climb<br>up the runs of the legal profession<br>doesn't work that way the job market was<br>tight in 1978 as it is again now<br>Cheryl's first job was at the Walker to<br>freezing works where she worked for six<br>years as a freezing worker in the Hawks<br>bag that tough environment helped give<br>her the and well outside the privilege<br>of the professions help give her the<br>toughness and resilience that she needs<br>now in keeping the enzian sis and the<br>GCSB and check on behalf of all of us<br>jobs in the freezing works are harder to<br>come by these days but you have a wide<br>range of career options before you armed<br>with a law degree from oakland<br>university with the bonus of a prize on<br>your cv the job possibilities for you<br>here and overseas are almost limitless<br>my own career as an example of how you<br>can chart your own path and purely<br>because the Dean did ask me to do this<br>I'm going to tell you just a little bit<br>about its in more specifically about how<br>my all kind of degree helped me if<br>you're open to new experiences and if<br>you're willing to step outside your<br>comfort zone you can enjoy a fascinating<br>career I took to the law slowly I found<br>a strong Paul to study medicine and I<br>never imagined at the time that it would<br>be possible to combine my interests in<br>law and medicine and carve out a novel<br>career in retrospect I can see that the<br>signs were there I wrote an essay and<br>family law on consent to medical<br>treatment of minors which one the<br>Auckland medico-legal essay prize I<br>think it may have been the only entrance<br>and it was my first publication so my<br>first piece of the career advisors to<br>follow your heart having returned to the<br>law school as a lecturer I watched with<br>great interest in 1987 1988 the<br>unfolding of Judge Sylvia Cartwright's<br>inquiry into catalan were inquiring to<br>the non treatment of<br>women with cervical carcinoma in situ at<br>National Women's Hospital and so I<br>started the teaching of the course in<br>medical legal studies at auckland in<br>1990 I think we have 70 or over 70 in<br>the and the elective this year and I<br>started teaching researching and writing<br>in the area and this led me into the<br>world of health policy and management<br>and a series of well-disposed deans of<br>whom andrew is the latest have been<br>kinda DUP to give me leave to take up<br>opportunities in health and public<br>administration so I was variously a<br>contract analyst and medical surgical<br>services and mental health services<br>policy manager later a deputy<br>director-general of health and public<br>health and and as you heard health and<br>disability Commissioner our national<br>health watchdog my law degree equipped<br>me well for these tasks mooting<br>competitions gave me confidence in<br>public speaking and efficacy though Mike<br>would want me to tell you that we were<br>knocked out in the first round of the<br>start competition skills and drafting<br>and which I put to use and how can drop<br>New Zealand's innovative code of<br>patients rights schools and dispute<br>resolution of course at that time we<br>didn't have the courses that you now<br>have an mediation and dispute resolution<br>which I was able to use in my role as<br>commissioner and indeed now use as<br>Ombudsman and in the health commissioner<br>role with a steady flow of complaints<br>the ability to develop the law in fields<br>as diverse as paid the rights of<br>patients waiting for access to public be<br>funded surgery through to follow-up<br>doctor's duty to follow up test results<br>when you think of it a High Court judge<br>may may may wait years for the<br>opportunity for a test case to to come<br>along and some member experiences along<br>the way overseas including appearing as<br>an expert witness at the trial a trial<br>inquiry rather into Harold Shipman the<br>Jenner<br>practitioner from hyde Manchester who<br>practiced undetected for two decades and<br>cooled up to 260 of his patients I also<br>have the opportunity to chair a review<br>of safety and quality in the Australian<br>health system so my career in health has<br>been interesting and rewarding I used my<br>degree and followed my heart along the<br>way I think I've learned more about<br>health than I could ever have learnt in<br>medical school I've done my bit to<br>improve the health system and I had the<br>great personal and professional<br>satisfaction in writing a book about<br>doctors and patients my second message<br>to you is that the prize you win tonight<br>may tell you something about yourself<br>that you don't yet appreciate it<br>appreciate it at the end of my first<br>year in law school I was surprised to be<br>awarded the Butterworth's price or legal<br>system and constitutional law I had<br>enjoyed statutory interpretation with<br>Jim Evans but i have found<br>constitutional law tedious little did I<br>know that one day I would occupy a<br>constitutional role in which I spent a<br>lot of time considering the lawfulness<br>and the regional pneus of the actions of<br>of government agencies in fields as<br>diverse as conservation and customs<br>education and health achieve just as<br>shown alas talks about the Ombudsman as<br>being example of life beyond legality<br>and I'm enjoying the creative potential<br>of the role one of my favorite pastimes<br>is running in tramping rather iiber I've<br>walked the routeburn track four times<br>and I run it one time on the concession<br>little did I know that one of my first<br>major cases as Ombudsman involved the<br>routeburn track a complainant challenged<br>the lawfulness and reasonableness of<br>Doc's decision to grant a private<br>company a concession allowing them to<br>take over night walking guided walkers<br>on the track a concession that was<br>sixty-six percent above the<br>that had just been imposed in a national<br>park management plan for mount aspiring<br>that had been two years in the in the<br>making the ink was barely dry law takes<br>you into diverse areas I had to read up<br>the national parks act the conservation<br>egg conservation management strategies<br>national management park plans and so<br>forth before concluding as I did that<br>doc had acted unreasonably and that<br>their justification for exceeding the<br>limits was as I put it nonsense on<br>Stubbs doc is now reviewing those plans<br>and how it grants concessions for the<br>whole country and even though the issues<br>and the numbers were small in a broader<br>sense seemed to me for those of us who<br>care about the conservation status state<br>and for those of us who care about the<br>rule of law it was a case that mattered<br>my third and final message draws on<br>another personal story in 1979 I was in<br>Papua New Guinea rafting down a river<br>that no one had ever rafted down on<br>international expedition I was shortly<br>headed for poor Oxford on a postgraduate<br>scholarship and one of the leaders of<br>the expedition captain Jim Masters said<br>this to me Ron he said you have been<br>given wonderful opportunities you will<br>need to find ways to give back the same<br>is true of our Award winners tonight the<br>real challenge for you is how to find<br>ways to carve out yourself a<br>professionally satisfying career and to<br>serve our community I wish you well<br>we now come to the winners of the<br>undergraduate prizes and scholarships<br>and because of the number in my fear<br>that if we try to have them all for a<br>single photograph the stage would<br>collect perhaps if we bring forward to<br>the stage all of the undergraduate prize<br>and scholarship winners happen to and<br>including the milk to Mason Heath prize<br>so if you would come forward now after<br>first year more our students are back on<br>the core law compulsory second year<br>subjects so this is where they come to<br>grips with some of the major conceptual<br>thinking in law they deal with contracts<br>torts crimes land and public law and<br>after they have completed the other<br>compulsory subject so equity<br>jurisprudence they move on to be able to<br>do around 10 or 11 elective courses<br>before finishing their degrees and<br>because of the size of this law school<br>the number of faculty members were able<br>to offer the largest range of electives<br>of Ed of the New Zealand law schools so<br>for a quite a number of our courses<br>you'll see that we have scholarships and<br>subject prizes but given that we're<br>offering about 50 electives a year as<br>well as I would say there is the<br>opportunity for any of you here tonight<br>who want to give us more scholarships<br>and prizes even though it might prolong<br>next year's ceremony somewhat I would<br>just mention the prize has been awarded<br>an obscene cheer and I do so really<br>because I do want to acknowledge the<br>firms and the individuals who have<br>donated the money for those prizes and<br>if

which they take part and<br>national and international competitions<br>the way in which they give service to<br>other students and organize all sorts of<br>events and activities that help make<br>this law school a really vibrant<br>exciting place where we have students<br>who not only do well in learning the law<br>and wanting to come to grips to the law<br>and but also display their enthusiasm<br>for what the law means and what it could<br>do so i'm really pleased with be able to<br>celebrate the achievements of our<br>students this evening on behalf of all<br>the members of the
