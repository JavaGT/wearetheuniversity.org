New Zealand, particularly Auckland, has a superdiverse population with a uniquely high proportion of indigenous people.<br> <br>Demographic disruption is an unacknowledged driver that keeps our economy outperforming many others. But like technological disruption, we need to be aware of demographic disruption because it requires different behaviour from business and citizens, and thus central and local government.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I'm sure that our speaker needs no<br>introduction because M chin is of course<br>one of New Zealand's best known lawyers<br>her career has spanned the academy the<br>law business and public policy she's an<br>Adjunct professor at the Oakland law<br>school and been an Adjunct professor at<br>the Oakland business school she's taught<br>on the master of laws program here at<br>Oakland and she was a faculty member at<br>the Victoria University of Wellington<br>law school May founded and is the<br>managing partner of Chen Palmer the<br>first law firm to specialize in public<br>law in austral Asia and repeatedly voted<br>New Zealand's top Public Law Firm in the<br>New Zealand law Awards She's also worked<br>at the international labor organization<br>in Geneva she's been a member of the<br>Securities Commission and just very<br>recently has been appointed to the board<br>of the Bank of New Zealand I think given<br>that resume is fair to say that may is a<br>veritable force of nature it's hard to<br>know how she manages to do everything<br>from running a business representing<br>clients commenting in the media and<br>writing books but I know that one of<br>May's aims is to make law and public<br>policy as accessible as possible to the<br>public so the writing that she's been<br>doing and some of you will have seen her<br>book transforming ockland uh is again<br>making accessible to the public the<br>story of the creation<br>of the Oakland super City uh and the new<br>mayor Oran Council that were created uh<br>her book Public Law toolbox uh which<br>I've been asked um to remind asked by<br>the people outside on the book stand to<br>remind is actually available for sale<br>outside um but again who book Public Law<br>toolbox is one which again aims to bring<br>uh the academic commentary to bring the<br>discussions in government uh and to<br>bring it again in language uh and in a<br>manner which is accessible uh to uh to<br>the members of the public and indeed I<br>think one faculty member was telling her<br>telling me uh that it was the only law<br>book uh that they'd actually seen in<br>their hairdressing Salon which I think<br>is a really great um tribute uh but<br>apparently their hairdresser said well<br>you know if they had problem with the<br>local government they had this book um<br>which you know told them what to do<br>May's commentary and again I suppose a<br>way of bringing accessibility of the law<br>and of public policy uh you know may is<br>someone who um again with her opinion<br>pieces uh in the newspapers her media<br>commentary uh as a way of doing uh that<br>service uh for people her subject<br>tonight is characteristically topical it<br>is the effects of demographic disruption<br>and super diversity and I think May's<br>personal experience of having immigrated<br>to New Zealand from Taiwan at a young<br>age her role as the founder and the<br>chair of New Zealand Asian leaders<br>combined with her Public Law and policy<br>expertise make her perfectly suited to<br>talk about the law and policy challenges<br>and and implications of super<br>diversity this is a subject of<br>importance for the future of New Zealand<br>and therefore is of considerable<br>interest uh to government to Business<br>Leaders to national and local government<br>politicians and to policy makers at all<br>levels and so I suppose uh it's<br>indicative of that that may has been<br>invited to repeat her talk here this<br>evening to The Institute of public<br>administration in Wellington in a few<br>weeks time we're very for forunate to be<br>able to hear firsthand this evening from<br>one of New Zealand's opinion leaders<br>chin well can I acknowledge the dean uh<br>Dr Andrew stockley can I acknowledge the<br>deputy Dean Susan Watson without which I<br>wouldn't without whom I wouldn't have<br>much of an inter relationship with<br>Oakland University uh can I acknowledge<br>Dr John sinle my husband uh for his 30<br>years of support uh in marriage and<br>another three just hanging around uh can<br>I acknowledge the minister The Honorable<br>David Seymour there are other MPS who<br>are present counselors uh there are so<br>many people here that I wish to<br>acknowledge tonight but most importantly<br>I want to start with a tribute to edma<br>henard who was the son of the late Sir<br>James henard and Lady Rose henard who<br>recently passed away he was not H he was<br>a great leader he held many pivotal<br>public and e leadership roles he was a<br>basan imp passionate expert and advocate<br>of ter<br>Mari I had the pleasure of working with<br>and Advising Eda he was eloquent<br>knowledgeable he had great Manor he made<br>a huge difference to this country and to<br>replaceable<br>no<br>I shifted to live in Oakland two and a<br>half years ago because I could see the<br>demographic disruption from<br>Wellington but up closer in personal<br>living here I realized there was a gap<br>in analyzing the legal and policy<br>challenges and implications of super<br>diversity and the implications for<br>business which I experience every day at<br>the coast May we're losing market share<br>the population is changing our customers<br>are changing our staff are still mainly<br>Anglo sex and what do we do so after 5<br>years writing two additions of public<br>law toolbox which I'd be very happy to<br>autograph for you outside afterwards<br>this is my next contribution to New<br>Zealand's super diverse future the<br>status quo is not sustainable super<br>diversity stock take which I will talk<br>to you about now is designed to help us<br>to adapt to a super diverse New Zealand<br>to make sure that we are fit for the<br>future because New Zealand is super<br>diverse right now predominantly in<br>Oakland but actually throughout New<br>Zealand here we're already 50% Mari<br>Pacifica in Asian 44% are not born in<br>New Zealand and we have over 200<br>ethnicities now the definition<br>academically of super diversity is 25%<br>not born in New Zealand 100 ethnicities<br>so we are almost double that number<br>already and Oakland will continue to<br>become younger and Browner as the<br>Anglo-Saxon population ages and shrinks<br>so the mega Trend here is not age and<br>the me the Mega Trend here is not<br>urbanization the mega trend is<br>demography it's ethnicity and we need to<br>get our headit around that because most<br>of the benefits from Super diversity<br>that we as a country are enjoying at the<br>moment such as greater Innovation<br>productivity and investment increase New<br>Zealand's Financial Capital whereas most<br>of the challenges from Super diversity<br>adversely affect New Zealand's Social<br>Capital however if you don't mitigate<br>the challenges to your Social Capital<br>you are not going to maximize<br>sustainably the diversity dividend<br>benefits for for your financial Capital<br>so the number one issue from the<br>perspective Ive of the super diverse and<br>let me tell you that is a perspective I<br>do not hear much people say to me oh<br>it's amazing you know we've got this you<br>you say there's a transformation it<br>hasn't affected us at all it's amazing<br>well actually no one asked the diverse<br>and what they will tell you is that the<br>number one issue for them is that they<br>as migrants for foreign sounding names<br>and their New Zealand born children are<br>not able to get jobs commensurate with<br>their qualifications and or prior<br>experience limited English is only an<br>issue in some cases the problem is also<br>due to mainstream employers who are put<br>off by Foreign sounding names Muhammad<br>Muhammad and don't have expertise in<br>interpreting the CVS of migrants not<br>born here this limits social and<br>economic opportunities it causes markets<br>not to work uh and it marginalizes a<br>diverse it also reinforces inequalities<br>resulting in Social cost and lost<br>economic opportunities it also means for<br>example fewer International students<br>which is a lucrative export earner in<br>New Zealand we're talking about $2.6<br>billion and Export dollars and we are<br>trying to push that up to5 Billion the<br>reason is because many come because of<br>good job prospects after graduating from<br>highquality educational provision in New<br>Zealand in a safe and welcoming<br>environment so it is imperative that<br>employers understand that migrants and<br>their New Zealand born children get this<br>statistic now comprise<br>56% of Oakland's talent pool that's the<br>workforce and that proportion is<br>projected to grow they need training to<br>interpret migrant CVS they need to Value<br>the skills that migrants have to<br>understand the different culture<br>language and expectations of a growing<br>ethnic population in New Zealand a<br>recent study from tuna mattini a center<br>of research excellent hosted by the<br>University of Oakland found that firms<br>that employ a higher fraction of high<br>ability in foreigners and thus our lower<br>fraction of high ability natives are<br>more likely to<br>export another challenge from Super<br>diversity is increasing cases of Migrant<br>employers exploiting migrant employees<br>but the good news is that New Zealand<br>has laws and policies in place to<br>prevent discrimination we've got the<br>Human Rights Act promly we've got the<br>employment Relations Act and we've got<br>the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act we've<br>also had the recent amendment to our<br>Immigration Act uh thank you to the<br>minister which increased penalties and<br>search powers in relation to migrant<br>employers to counteract migrant<br>exploitation the exploitation of<br>migrants on temporary entry class visas<br>with work conditions is now an offence<br>and employers who hold residents class<br>visas are liable for<br>deportation if they are convicted of<br>exploiting migrant workers or of<br>knowingly employing migrant workers<br>without the right to work now my<br>research also shows that the rights of<br>minorities and I'd love to have spent<br>the entire lecture on the New Zealand<br>Bill of Rights act because I tell you<br>every single one of those Provisions in<br>the Bill of Rights Act which are little<br>used not the subject of any case<br>law will be the subject of much greater<br>use and the subject of much greater case<br>law in future that is where the<br>challenges will come and we will see new<br>jurist Prudence in that<br>area um but the question there is did<br>you know under Section 20 of the New<br>Zealand Bill of Rights Act there's a<br>right of minorities it's a right to<br>protect linguistic minorities ethnic<br>minorities uh and also religious<br>minorities and the question I ask is is<br>it just a negative right where you're<br>not allowed to interfere or is it<br>requiring the government to take<br>positive measures not only in terms of<br>its own activities but with respect to<br>third party<br>activities New Zealand's growing super<br>diversity makes targeting migrant<br>customers the best way to grow market<br>share businesses need to communicate<br>differently with migrants and this isn't<br>just about communicating with migrants<br>in their own<br>language it's also about taking account<br>of their different cultural values and<br>their expectations as customers uh I'm<br>running a seminar soon for New Zealand<br>Asian leaders we're getting beta n key<br>from uh food stuffs to talk they tell me<br>that in some areas in Oakland rice is<br>their number one best selling product I<br>think about the fact that Sharia<br>friendly mortgages from financial<br>institutions are now in demand because<br>paying or receiving Internet interest on<br>loans is forbidden in Islam new gr<br>migrants may also need more assistance<br>as customers I've seen companies do<br>demographics with they s or takes<br>generally takes an hour or half an hour<br>to service a client well it might be<br>different if you getting an increasing<br>number of Migrant clients and targeting<br>the explanation may not be at Mom and<br>Dad who may not speak English that well<br>but at the children who actually come<br>and learn the language much faster so of<br>course the growing ethnic customer base<br>means that they have growing Market<br>power but this is actually matched by<br>the growing political power of the super<br>diverse as their numbers increase now<br>Minister we can all count if you are a<br>major party and you want to begin in<br>government you have to win one out of<br>every two votes and you have to win<br>ockland so<br>demography may have Democratic<br>implications if the ethnics vote on<br>ethnic lines let me give you an<br>example referenda is the obvious example<br>and this year we're going to have two<br>referenda to be held on the New Zealand<br>flag in 2015 2016 now that's going to be<br>determined by preferential voting and<br>single majority vote respectively the<br>flag is a symbol it's a symbol of<br>nationhood it's about culture values and<br>it will be very interesting to see what<br>impact the growing uh ethnic super<br>diversity of New Zealand has on how<br>people vote but of course super<br>diversity also has<br>implications for a part of that super<br>diversity which is Mari now New Zealand<br>has very unusual super diversity<br>compared say with Australia where<br>aines are 3% of the population Native<br>Americans uh in the United States which<br>are 1.7% of the population mainly in<br>reservations or even in Canada which<br>only up to 4.3% we are 15% and growing<br>and yet Asians and Pacifica now<br>outnumber Mari so what does that mean<br>well it means that uh in terms of pretty<br>of wangi and special status of Mari is<br>tongue of Fina including Mari seats in<br>Parliament the independent Mari<br>statutory board onland Council and the<br>numerous treaty settlement acts which<br>Grant specific functions and powers to<br>some ew and hapu uh which are still only<br>recognized as ordinary laws with no<br>higher legal<br>status Mari rights and interests could<br>be affected by a demographic transition<br>away from a simple Pam majority Mari<br>minority model what does that mean well<br>it means that in terms of Social Capital<br>it is incredibly important to teach<br>migrants about the Treaty of wangi about<br>its constitutional status and that T<br>Mari is an official language of New<br>Zealand uh we also need Mari to<br>understand uh better understand the<br>benefits that migrants bring including<br>access to lucrative markets uh for mared<br>produce so New Zealand's currently High<br>transparent non-corrupt government and<br>business culture may also be challenged<br>by super diversity in 2014 New Zealand<br>ranked second on the Transparency<br>International corruption perceptions<br>index in contrast the ratings of the top<br>Source countries of skilled principal<br>immigrants to New Zealand have mixed<br>results China ranked at 100 India and<br>the Philippines 85th equal the United<br>Kingdom 14 South Africa<br>67 finally super diversity may lead to<br>extremism which may have a link to<br>terrorism the important point is to<br>ensure that the higher levels of<br>religious diversity New Zealand now has<br>does not adversely converge with low<br>Social Capital to produce<br>marginalization isolation and anger and<br>thereby increasing the risk of terrorism<br>but when I interviewed Dr anoir gani Who<br>is in charge of the uh Muslim<br>Association he didn't talk about uh the<br>anger with respect to the uh Freedom<br>Fighters legislation he said our number<br>one issue is that our very highly<br>qualified young people can't get jobs<br>because they're called Muhammad Muhammad<br>uh and so that is interesting because<br>you feel the anger from these people and<br>it makes me worry um but let me also say<br>to you that immigration in conclusion<br>it's important to get the balance right<br>between financial and Social Capital to<br>ensure that we can sustainably maximize<br>the diversity dividend in New Zealand<br>but immigration law and policy which<br>regulates how many migrants we take who<br>they are where they settle and the<br>contribution they must make to get in is<br>only part of the answer to getting the<br>balance right whatever immigration<br>policy is adopted must remain race<br>neutral not like the historical<br>immigration policies in New Zealand<br>which included discriminatory Provisions<br>against Chinese and Pacifica in<br>particular part of the super diversity<br>stock dat has an appendix uh setting out<br>that legislation and it's it's very<br>interesting to read but Central and<br>local govern business organizations and<br>all new zealanders need information to<br>better understand and adapt to our<br>demographic makeup the trends the<br>benefits the challenges and how best to<br>deal with those challenges that<br>information is critical to strategic<br>business planning how can you plan your<br>business when you don't know what your<br>customers are going to look like your<br>customers are fundamentally changing and<br>so is your talent pool some measures<br>have already been taken and when I<br>started this I thought very little had<br>been done I was<br>wrong quite a lot has been done but it's<br>it's scattered so that uh for many uh<br>they wouldn't be able to find it and for<br>me even though I'm interested in this<br>topic I'd never read the stuff so what<br>it needs to happen is we need to bring<br>it together and that's why I'm<br>undertaking a super diversity stock take<br>and I'm going to publish it this year<br>because I'm at the cace and this is<br>needed now we need the information<br>that's already available whether it's<br>statistics analysis research I've got Dr<br>Karina me here who runs the Research<br>Unit at Oakland Council they're<br>producing fabulous stuff MB there's a<br>Research Unit in there and immigration<br>they do fantastic research very few<br>people have read that we need to<br>leverage off what's already been done to<br>predict where the challenges will come<br>from and to make sure that we are ready<br>because New Zealand is already the fifth<br>most ethnically diverse country in the<br>oecd one in every four residents in New<br>Zealand was born overseas although it's<br>important for me to note that this is<br>not just an Oakland phenomenon I went to<br>inago as you do and I spoke to<br>450 rural women I've never been so cold<br>in my life uh and what they told me is<br>that two out of every three Farm worker<br>is Asian so I went and looked at the<br>stat statistics because it's not just a<br>city phenomenon actually most New<br>Zealand Farms are staffed primarily by<br>Filipinos Indians and Sri Lankans and<br>people of South American descent and<br>this is not just Farm managers it's also<br>Farm Workers uh New Zealand has also<br>gained 56,000 people from overseas in<br>the last 12 months uh to March this year<br>intending to stay for longer than 12<br>months look there's a whole bunch of<br>demographics but what I'm saying is that<br>demography is going to continue to be a<br>driver of our economy and it's something<br>that is here to stay<br>Wellington is New Zealand's second most<br>ethnically diverse City the 2013 senses<br>indicated that Wellington had uh Asian<br>people at 10.5% and the second highest<br>Pacific Islander population at 7.7%<br>Christ Church is also experiencing<br>significant immigration arrivals and I<br>know that the minister introduced some<br>new policies today<br>to help with the rebuild uh so once<br>again the 2013 Census revealed that<br>almost 12% of Christ churches overseas<br>born population had arrived in the 2<br>years prior of census now you contrast<br>with it with Oakland where uh 9% of New<br>Zealand's overseas born population had<br>arrived in the two years preceding<br>however Christ Church's new migrants are<br>less ethnically diverse uh with 28%<br>coming from the UK and Ireland versus<br>just 12% uh for<br>Oakland no other city in the oecd except<br>Dublin dominates nationally to the<br>extent that Oakland does and in the next<br>25 years the city will grow to account<br>for 38% of the total population<br>surpassing even Dublin's do dominance<br>why does that matter because if we're<br>talking about social capital and the<br>challenges I'm talking about convergence<br>we've got increased ethnicity plus we've<br>got this town and regions thing<br>happening and that erods trust what is<br>social capital it's trust anything that<br>erods trust is going to increase the uh<br>scratchiness is going to increase the<br>challenge is going to make it harder for<br>us to live together to trust each other<br>to work together for maximizing New<br>Zealand Inc 65% of New Zealand's<br>Pacifica Community live in Oakland and<br>of course we use this funny term Asian<br>but it's simply because you know we all<br>look the same uh but Asia actually<br>refers to people whose ethnicities<br>originate in the Asian continent it<br>stretches from Afghanistan to Japan from<br>China to the north of Indonesia um so<br>one-third of aucklanders speak one or<br>more languages other than English Mari<br>and Pacifica populations also tend to be<br>young the median ages European 41 Mari<br>23 Pacifica peoples<br>22 Asians 30.6 years so it's estimated<br>that the Asian popul population will<br>grow by 130,000 we're moving to 1 and<br>three in Oakland by 2021 and that<br>worries me because of the amount of<br>discrimination here already and the fact<br>that with increasing or decreasing<br>Social Capital that discrimination will<br>increase New Zealand has had<br>historically High rates of intermarriage<br>across both ethnic and religious divides<br>there's a shift towards identification<br>with multiple ethnicities so if you look<br>at the number of births now very<br>interesting baby's been born 1 2 3 4<br>five ethnicities so what does Dame Susan<br>Devo say as race relations commissioner<br>she's remarked that quote by 2040 there<br>will be no one majority ethnic group in<br>Oakland uh that dominates and we must<br>prepare for these changes<br>now so if you look at the uh population<br>of Asians mostly Chinese mostly Indians<br>in terms of linguistic super diversity<br>uh they mostly speak after English toari<br>s and Hindi it's pretty interesting if<br>you're business out there and you're<br>trying to reach demographics but this is<br>a worrying statistic because I'm about<br>to move to uh democracy and demography<br>87,000 people and this was only measured<br>in 2013 don't speak English at all so<br>they just don't put English down as one<br>of the languages they speak and not<br>surprisingly 60% of the those people<br>predominantly come from Asian<br>backgrounds having said that though 62%<br>of Asians speak a second language<br>compared with 19% of all new zealanders<br>so they make great employees and four<br>times as many Asians speak a third<br>language compared to the total<br>population so what are we talking about<br>in terms of the diversity dividend well<br>as I said increase productivity<br>creativity and Innovation it's all there<br>in the studies but also that increased<br>diversity underpins as I said not just<br>International Education but<br>tourism and tourism of course is a huge<br>uh money earner now I want to quickly<br>move to Social Capital social capital of<br>course was defined by the treasury and<br>it's working towards higher living<br>standards because it understands that<br>you can't get the financial gains if you<br>don't work on the social capital as well<br>and in a report by Doug McKai the former<br>Oakland uh Council CEO he said quote<br>ethnic diversity can increase social<br>distrust crime and lead to<br>discrimination Division and ultimately<br>unrest the result of poorly settled<br>migrants can be generational cycles of<br>social cost lost economic opportunities<br>there are signs now in Oakland of<br>increasing discrimination of recent<br>migrants from Asia as a result they<br>withdraw back to their communities<br>should this continue there's a potential<br>for Oakland to become increasingly<br>segregated and then treasury went on<br>about all the problems you get if you<br>get low Social Capital what we're really<br>saying is that in 2015 the Asian New<br>Zealand Foundation brought out a study<br>it was very recent remember it was all<br>on The Herald and they talked about<br>these ethnoburbs where you had the top<br>five areas where you get Chinese<br>congregated uh the top five areas we get<br>the Indians congregated the South<br>Koreans the Filipinos and I guess the<br>real issue from our point of viewers to<br>understand why they congregate there is<br>it because they're discriminated against<br>and they want to hide do they feel safer<br>in numbers or is it just that the food<br>Outlets are there the elite schools are<br>there or maybe they don't speak very<br>good English and so it's quite good to<br>be with a whole bunch of other people<br>who actually speak your home language I<br>think the key thing is that culture<br>isn't fixed it's not static and the<br>concern I think is that some older new<br>zealanders in particular may be nervous<br>that New Zealand culture and values will<br>no longer dominate um and that'll be<br>replaced with new alien values which of<br>course will erode social capital and of<br>course I'm never going to get to foreign<br>um investment at the rate I'm going um<br>but I've done a whole bunch of work<br>about the regulation there and obviously<br>that's driving some of the xenophobia<br>there but the other issues with respect<br>to foreign investment relate to<br>strategic assets and it also relates to<br>these old values uh that we were talking<br>about so in terms of the discrimination<br>against against the diverse um it's<br>pretty sobering uh a 2013 survey into<br>perceptions of workplace<br>discrimination uh concluded that<br>migrants were significantly more likely<br>to experience workplace discrimination<br>than New Zealand born employees highest<br>rate of discrimination was recorded<br>mainly Asians uh and Then followed by<br>people from Latin America from Africa<br>and other words anybody who looks<br>different so women are also likely to<br>experience uh more discrimination uh<br>those with higher levels of Education<br>who are diverse are likely to report<br>more<br>discrimination um and there's an over<br>over representation of computing and<br>health professionals among Asian<br>migrants but what the research shows is<br>that what for whatever reason uh there<br>is an overwhelming number of Asians who<br>are overqualified for the job that they<br>are in uh so for example Asians with a<br>bachelor's degree were three times more<br>likely to be working as Clerk than the<br>national average so that's 33% versus<br>11% now there is so much evidence over<br>these Pages uh but what I wanted to get<br>to uh was the very disturbing reports in<br>human rights commission reports that had<br>been done of migrants and refugees<br>experiencing blatant racism through<br>verbal and physical abuse one incident<br>uh that's recounted that was just so sad<br>was an Asian boy who was assaulted<br>incited a fish shop when he picked<br>himself up because he'd been pushed to<br>the ground and asked the piaia man why<br>he had pushed him the Pia man said that<br>this was because the boy locked Asian<br>now the concern there is recent<br>incidents such as new zealanders<br>dragging Asians out of cars and<br>assaulting them prior to confiscating<br>the keys for alleged eratic driving will<br>have an adverse impact on financial<br>Capital it's going to have an impact on<br>International tourism it's going to have<br>an impact on International students so<br>the key issue is is what do we do about<br>all of this now I've got uh 10 more<br>topics and I can't cover them so what<br>I'm going to do is I'm now going to<br>cover Democratic and constitutional<br>because elections are really interesting<br>uh we've got a lot of migrants and they<br>don't vote that's basically the summary<br>of 50 pages um trans uh and then there's<br>problems with transparency State sector<br>responsiveness then I will look at the<br>Bora issues because they're the most<br>interesting that's the Bill of Rights<br>we're never going to get to immigration<br>policy although I've done some<br>interesting work there we're never going<br>to get to foreign investment uh and we<br>won't have time to cover extremism or<br>the Mario Dimension and I've written<br>some pretty interesting stuff about that<br>um the stuff we're going to skip is<br>education faith in schools accommodation<br>of increasing numbers of international<br>students number of Migrant children in<br>schools for whom English is a second<br>language the high numbers of oian<br>students in Elite schools for example<br>Oakland grammar already has almost 40%<br>Asians compulsory uniforms not<br>conforming with religious practices such<br>as kneelength skirts ban on facial hair<br>a blanket ban on wearing religious<br>symbols the delivery of subjects such as<br>physical education sex education science<br>the use of taxpayer funded school<br>facilities for religious observance um<br>EG such as a classroom for Muslims to<br>pray we're not going to look at women<br>wearing burka while giving evidence we<br>are not going to look at the corrections<br>act an appropriate provision for<br>cultural and religious needs of inmates<br>we're not looking at animal rights and<br>hello Slaughter and Shakita uh<br>slaughtering we're not looking at female<br>circumcision culturally arranged<br>marriages political polygamous marriages<br>nor intercountry adoptions and we're not<br>going to look at Super diversity and<br>health nor are we going to look at Super<br>diversity and burials what we are going<br>to look at is De Democratic and<br>constitutional issues so as I<br>say uh no major party can rule without<br>the support of Mari Pacifica and Asian<br>demographics um but of course they have<br>to vote now immigrants in particular<br>have lower rates of electoral turnout<br>than the total population and uh they<br>have much lower voter turnout so if I<br>was to summarize the next p 10 pages<br>which I was desperate to read to you<br>what it essentially says is that they<br>don't enroll they don't vote when you<br>ask them why they don't enroll and vote<br>they they say they can't read the stuff<br>or they don't understand the stuff<br>um and so and also that they have no<br>habit of voting because as you know<br>voting is a habit uh your parents vote<br>you vote we're passing on to my son he<br>votes I'm sure daddy actually took him<br>to the voting booth as soon as he was<br>old enough to be taken I don't know if<br>he gave any advice in the voting booth<br>but he saw us do it so the difficulty<br>here is what happens when you don't have<br>any of these things going on um and and<br>what you find is that the Asian<br>demographics are there in terms of the<br>non-voting along with people who are um<br>uh in lower school jobs lower paid jobs<br>solo parents uh all of the demographics<br>uh that don't uh vote a lot so the of<br>course this is translated into a lack of<br>diverse representation in Parliament uh<br>for example following the 2014 general<br>election Parliament comprised of only 2%<br>Mari uh 6% Pacifica 4% Asian MPS only<br>two political parties of Asian MPS 84%<br>of ministers in and out of cabinet are<br>European uh yet if you look at the 2013<br>Census figures you've got 35% of the<br>vote Nationwide if they voted along<br>ethnic lines I'm not saying they should<br>I'm not saying that they will but all<br>I'm saying is that if democracy is about<br>majority rule then actually things may<br>be changing now I've done an analysis of<br>electoral law there is uh because of<br>this greater diversity uh and the fact<br>that section 12 of the Bill of Rights<br>affirms the right for every adult<br>citizen of New Zealand to vote in<br>regular elections for Parliament there<br>is no English language requirement in<br>the Electoral act for a person to vote<br>or to be elected or to participate in<br>local government so of course what's<br>going to happen is that super diversity<br>is going to increase issues with voting<br>and language limit ations particularly<br>in the context of close-run Elections<br>you can see it um and so if you look at<br>the Electoral act at the moment<br>increased linguistic diversity makes it<br>more difficult for a voter with English<br>language limitations to meaningfully<br>participate there's a practical limit to<br>the number of uh different languages in<br>which electoral information can be<br>provided the Electoral act itself is<br>silent as to whether the Electoral<br>commission and returning officers must<br>publish electoral information and<br>languages other than English having said<br>that they published it in 26 mainly<br>Asian languages so that's not bad the<br>Electoral act also permits but it<br>doesn't require the appointment of<br>interpreters as polling place officials<br>the Electoral rigs require that before<br>an interpreter can be called uh on the<br>returning officer for a polling place<br>must draw to the attention of a voter<br>who appears who appears unfamiliar with<br>English uh to a poster with instructions<br>in English and other language if the<br>voter still requires assistance that an<br>interpreter can assist but The<br>Interpreter cannot help that person to<br>vote obviously the ACT does provide that<br>while people must verbally give their<br>names to receive a ballot paper those<br>not understanding English May confirm<br>their name by gesture or with the<br>assistance of a person they've been<br>nominated to assist similarly a voter<br>who's not sufficiently familiar with the<br>English language to vote without<br>assistance may bring a person with them<br>into the voting booth to help them Mark<br>the voting paper similar Provisions<br>apply to the 2011 referendum on the<br>electoral system held pursuant to the<br>Electoral referendum act 2010 an<br>indicative referenda held under the<br>citizens initiated referenda act<br>1993 so if you think about this the<br>opportunities for voting misconduct are<br>obvious and actually I can see a little<br>business running here whereby you find a<br>whole bunch of people and you say I'll<br>help you to vote and then maybe you<br>could say to somebody else well of<br>course if you I can deliver you certain<br>votes I'm not saying that anyone will do<br>this but all I'm saying is that it's<br>obvious it's a gap we need to plug in<br>future because we will have issues if<br>we're not careful so this is about<br>predicting where the challenges are<br>coming from because we haven't had to<br>deal with so much of this but we will<br>have to deal with more of this in future<br>um and of course there are Provisions<br>also under the local electoral act<br>2001 uh which the Electoral office<br>officer can assist with when you've got<br>a person who has difficulties with<br>language there are also Provisions in<br>the referenda postal Voting Act 2000 so<br>I'm not saying there's no provision it's<br>great if you look at our law there are<br>so many Provisions all I'm saying is<br>that they haven't been used much and<br>they haven't been challenged much and I<br>suspect that there's they're going to be<br>used a lot more and there's going to be<br>a lot more challenges in this area so<br>it's interesting uh to look at it there<br>have been a lot of measur has taken to<br>try and increase and improve civic<br>participation um and uh there but it's<br>clear that more will need to be done<br>because the difficulty is forming the<br>Habit uh to vote uh meaning that a voter<br>elector who didn't vote in 2013 is more<br>likely not to vote in future and those<br>immigrants who arrive with no habit of<br>voting may need more encouragement to<br>vote than the general population but<br>when I talk to the Electoral commission<br>they don't get any more funding um for<br>Oakland than they do for anywhere else<br>in New Zealand a quick word on<br>transparency and anti-corruption<br>measures I've talked about the issues<br>with the Transparency International<br>index um a recent uh deoe 2014 survey of<br>269 public and private organizations<br>across New Zealand and Australia found<br>that company with overseas operations<br>had experienced an increase in<br>corruption outside of New Zealand only<br>31% of companies conducting business<br>overseas had a proper understanding of<br>relevant overseas bribery and Corruption<br>laws 40% reported not having a formal<br>bribery and Corruption compliance<br>program so why did deoe think the<br>increase had<br>happened uh the director of the study<br>quote where people are migrating to New<br>Zealand from countries with high<br>corruption levels they may expect new<br>zealanders to behave in a similar way as<br>they did back home it is important to<br>help migrants who come here to<br>understand the very different government<br>and business environment in which they<br>operate uh they're not bad it's just<br>that back in their home country that's<br>the way you operate in fact when I<br>recently went to an Asian country I was<br>I was told by the guide now look if you<br>get here's the car and if you get pulled<br>aside by an officer<br>then it's fine just pay x amount um but<br>if that's not enough and he threatens to<br>take you back to the station you'll have<br>to triple it so that that was the advice<br>not not these are the rules this is how<br>you comply with the with with staying on<br>the road so um the the issue is uh that<br>changes in the corruption policies and<br>laws of migrants Home countries might<br>have an impact and of course China<br>recently as you know has been trying to<br>crack down on corruption and maybe that<br>has an impact here um I just just want<br>to now say a quick word about State<br>sector responsibility and super<br>diversity because we've been talking<br>about the need to be match fit fit for<br>the future with all of this uh um super<br>diversity coming down the pipe and so uh<br>the question is does the public sector<br>have the capability to deal with<br>diversity does the public sector ensure<br>diversity in policy and lawmaking why<br>does it matter well simply that they<br>here for the customers who are the<br>customers new zealanders who are new<br>zealanders well it's in so if new<br>zealanders are transforming then<br>actually uh the people who are servicing<br>new zealanders in terms of policy and<br>law also need to reflect that change so<br>at the moment we've got uh 7% of public<br>servant erosion under 2% are in Senior<br>Management uh in terms of uh where they<br>are uh on all government boards every<br>single one of them there is 4.9% Asians<br>on government boards uh on the private<br>sector uh New Zealand Asian leaders did<br>study with deot top 100 companies uh top<br>100 ndet companies including uh those<br>who've got their biggest markets in Asia<br>5% um so what I looked at was We did an<br>analysis of the performance Improvement<br>framework results for all government<br>departments the reason is because one of<br>the measures is how well departments are<br>responding to government priorities and<br>one government priority which is a<br>measure is quote how well does the<br>agency develop and maintain a diverse<br>highly committed and engaged Workforce<br>how well does the agency encourage<br>diverse ideas cultures and thinking<br>throughout the organization close quote<br>that's the measure right here we go uh<br>so uh it indicates that 70% of the<br>government agencies reviewed under the<br>piff that's what it's called have<br>received a negative rating in this area<br>19 receiving a needing a development<br>rating and seven received a weak rating<br>um<br>um so further several of the agencies<br>which had received a positive rating in<br>the area didn't have any ethnically<br>diverse staff at all so I'm just running<br>my eye down this amazing chart and look<br>um the will is there and they understand<br>they need to do more so Department of<br>prime minister and cabinet needing<br>development statistics New Zealand<br>needing development acellent<br>compensation needing development<br>parliamentary service weak uh the New<br>Zealand intelligence community in uh<br>needing development uh careers New<br>Zealand weak so look I could go on but<br>uh the good thing is that that's a good<br>starting point we've got the piff at<br>least as a measure and the great thing<br>is that New Zealand Asian leaders has<br>convened a public officials group and<br>we're getting all the asan Civil Stant<br>together to say look uh you've got to be<br>competent at your job you got to have<br>all the technical ability and the<br>qualifications but you could also help<br>by bringing cultural intelligence and<br>some knowledge of culture and language<br>so so that now allows me to get to Bora<br>now the Bill of Rights Act is so<br>exciting and uh the difficulty is that<br>I'm supposed to go through the Human<br>Rights Act and the employment Relations<br>there it's daunting there's 60 pages of<br>this but the but look let me summarize<br>the human rights act in a minute here's<br>the summary the Human Rights Act does<br>most of it so if you've got a problem<br>with discrimination that's mainly where<br>you go and the great thing is that part<br>that deals with the uh discrimination on<br>the grounds of uh ethnicity uh applies<br>to acts and omissions by the executive<br>the legislature or persons or bodies in<br>the performance of any public function<br>power or Duty confered or imposed on<br>that person or Body by or pursuant to<br>law and of course uh the uh human rights<br>review tribunal can also Grant remedies<br>including Declarations of inconsistency<br>where enactments are in breach of part<br>1A it's direct discrimination it's<br>indirect discrimination and on top of<br>that employers are required to<br>accomodate practices that are required<br>by an employees religious ethical<br>beliefs Etc so long as the adjustment of<br>the employer activities don't<br>unreasonably disrupt the employer<br>activities right now um there's also a<br>whole heap of Provisions here which<br>relate to racial hostility to racial<br>harassment and there's a criminal<br>offense of inciting racial disharmony<br>hardly ever used and can you believe<br>this prosecution still requires the<br>consent of the attorney general which is<br>odd but of course the justification<br>given is that criminalizing speech is<br>undesirable all right so then moving<br>right along the employment Relations Act<br>doesn't even get a minute just trust me<br>there's good stuff in there I'm going to<br>move to the Bill of Rights act because<br>the Bill of Rights Act is exciting the<br>reason is because if you go and look<br>under demographic Democratic and civil<br>rights there's a whole bunch of<br>Provisions at the moment that nobody has<br>much looked at why well you know the bll<br>of Rights Act has been a bit of a Rogues<br>Charter you know we've been heavily<br>focused on the criminal stuff um but<br>look at 13 freedom of thought conscience<br>and religion look at 14 freedom of<br>expression look at 15 manifestation of<br>religion and belief so 13 is thinking it<br>uh 15 is acting it um 16 freedom of<br>peaceful assembly is marches uh freedom<br>of Association I is matches uh freedom<br>of movement I is Freedom Fighters<br>um that's section 18 section 19 freedom<br>from discrimination that's used a lot<br>but section 20 and I just want to read<br>out section 20 because it's actually a<br>very yummy provision but for some reason<br>it is very little used um a person who<br>belongs to an ethnic religious or<br>linguistic minority in New Zealand shall<br>not be denied the right in community<br>with other members of that Minority to<br>enjoy the culture to profess and<br>practice a religion or to use the<br>language of the minority now let me pose<br>some questions to you that will make you<br>think so you've got section 13 which is<br>about inward thought and religion you<br>got 15 which is about outward<br>manifestation of religion and then what<br>you need to think about is not just each<br>one of these rights separately you need<br>to think about them in combination with<br>each other so if you got 13 and 15<br>that's quite interesting if you've got<br>13 and 15 and then you've got 14 as well<br>freedom of expression that's Charlie hio<br>right okay um and then you say to<br>yourself okay well if I've got 13 you<br>you were now starting to think which one<br>was 13 mate look it's about religion<br>okay if it's 13 and 15 and 14 is<br>expression then does it make any<br>difference if you add to that the right<br>of religious minorities under<br>20 and then you may also use section 19<br>so I'm I'm just asking all of these<br>questions I'm asking questions like does<br>section 20 add to these Provisions if<br>you stack them all together like that um<br>because of course you've also got then<br>19 which deals with discrimination<br>you've got 20 that deals with minorities<br>and what happens when you team those two<br>up right and then if you put that all to<br>one side then you think about Mari<br>because Mari have a whole bunch of<br>issues and they don't much like being<br>stuck under Section 20 because then they<br>they say well we're not just a minority<br>like everybody else we're indigenous to<br>be honest the treaty gives them more<br>than they'd get under Section 20 because<br>section 20 is a negative right it's a<br>right not to be interfered with by the<br>state but it's really a little bit<br>difficult to argue that over and beyond<br>that there are positive obligations on<br>the state although there are cases which<br>I have identified that show the<br>government needs to go further not just<br>in terms of positive measures for its<br>own actions but with respect to third<br>parties um but then you have to say to<br>yourself given that religions already<br>dealt with so section 20 remember deals<br>with three sorts of minorities religious<br>minorities linguistic minorities and<br>ethnic minorities sorry and cultural<br>minorities then maybe with respect to<br>linguistic minorities and cultural<br>minorities the right to<br>culture we there is no other provision<br>in the Bill of rights that deals with<br>those people Now<br>language I think in the last 5 years<br>I've done more on language than in any<br>other area and so what happened was in<br>2010 the Ministry of Education cut<br>funding for the future production of<br>Pacific language and literacy<br>materials and so there was a public<br>outcry from Pacifica families teachers<br>and organizations they formed the biling<br>Leo Pacific Coalition which submitted a<br>petition to Parliament in 2011<br>requesting that the government continue<br>production of Pacific languages<br>resources and fund Pacific languages<br>literacy and English literacy<br>development through bilingual education<br>programs for Pacific students uh the the<br>Coalition considered that the lack of<br>special status for Pacific languages was<br>also inconsistent with New Zealand's<br>growing Pacifica community and its<br>unique constitutional relationship with<br>Pacific island nations I know that cuz I<br>drafted them the bill I said to them<br>well look we've got the sign language<br>Bill we've got the ter Mari Bill why<br>don't we have a pacifical languages bill<br>but of course the the issue is that<br>section 20 doesn't quite get you there<br>because section 20 is the right for the<br>state not to interfere with you but it's<br>difficult to argue that it goes further<br>to require the state to make you an<br>official language of New<br>Zealand and uh there's some interesting<br>cases uh in the with respect to the uh<br>European convention on human rights and<br>with respect to the United Nations human<br>rights committee uh concerning uh uh the<br>international Covenant on civil and<br>political rights about that um but all<br>I'm saying to you is those challenges<br>will come and there will be more of them<br>and what people will want to know is<br>where does section 20 get you if you're<br>a linguistic minority uh and there's a<br>whole bunch of law about what is a<br>linguistic minority but most of the<br>ethnic groups in New Zealand would fall<br>within the definition and then what<br>about cultural minorities because the<br>question there is what does culture mean<br>uh so as as you can see uh the these<br>issues are important because even when<br>you look at religion for example the<br>2013 Census figures reveal that New<br>Zealand is becoming increasingly secular<br>and the number of people reporting no<br>religion increases nevertheless New<br>Zealand is simultaneously becoming more<br>religiously diverse as traditionally<br>minority religions continue to grow for<br>example the number of people affiliating<br>with the sik religion has doubled since<br>2006 the number of people affiliating<br>with Hinduism has grown by almost 40%<br>since 2006 the number of people<br>affiliating with Islam has increased by<br>almost 30% since<br>2006 and a greater and and a quarter of<br>those people were born in New Zealand<br>but there was a story in there about uh<br>the a big uh monument and uh did you see<br>that the 30 foot shiver in the backyard<br>uh and so that the neighbors had invited<br>the Catholic neighbors next door to come<br>the cathol neighbors thought that that<br>wasn't so good so all I'm saying to you<br>is that I'm pointing out to you simply<br>that there are clouds and there's sun<br>and there's a bit of rain but you just<br>need to understand that we are in a<br>transformation situation now as a<br>consequence of that when you get figures<br>like that there is likely to be much<br>more use now it's 7 minutes<br>past and uh and so just uh I could go<br>into great detail with respect to these<br>60 pages but I think that you probably<br>don't want me to I've also read all of<br>the cases so let me just summarize all<br>50 of them for you essentially what they<br>say is this you can argue culture if you<br>like so there are cases where oh people<br>uh killed people people raped people and<br>then they wanted to make up for it in<br>the usual way you know they wanted to<br>make up for it in their cultural way<br>they wanted to give gifts and things and<br>the judges said look yes I can take<br>culture into account but look uh not if<br>you're killing people all right there<br>are limits uh there was a a father who<br>had left nothing to his daughters<br>because in the culture that he came from<br>it was for the sons and the men in the<br>family to uh provide for the women and<br>the judge once again said no sorry<br>that's not on might have been on where<br>you were from but in this country we<br>can't apply that provision so there's no<br>doubt that they do take account of<br>culture generally in<br>sentencing uh with respect to what is<br>the appropriate punishment um but it's<br>pretty difficult to argue that as a<br>consequence of culture um you're getting<br>uh uh you're not you're not in breach uh<br>of various Provisions particularly<br>criminal uh Provisions so um Andrew how<br>many more minutes do you reckon I can<br>bludge your am I at my end close you're<br>very close all right so I think what<br>he's really saying to me is that I<br>should try and summarize and uh my<br>summary is simply this that as you can<br>see even though<br>uh I only realized when I came back uh<br>from my break over Christmas that this<br>was the big issue for New Zealand in the<br>next 5 years uh my research has elicited<br>so much of Interest it has been like<br>emptying the sea with a spoon and it's<br>clear to me that there is so much more<br>out there which might be helpful to new<br>zealanders to government to business to<br>organizations schools Hospital to all<br>new zealanders to help us to think about<br>where we are now and to think about<br>where the challenges might come from to<br>think about the great upside but not to<br>take it for granted because if you ask<br>the people at the coace there are some<br>challenges at the coace people say oh<br>you know but I wouldn't have thought<br>there AR are any issues well there may<br>not be for you so it's simply the reason<br>why uh in a perfectly happy world when I<br>could just practice law<br>I've decided to set up a super diversity<br>Center for Law policy and business which<br>was launched today I'm doing it in<br>partnership with the University of<br>Oakland School of Law which is my Law<br>School of<br>Choice uh and uh we are publishing the<br>super diversity stock take it's going to<br>be published this year it won't be<br>perfect but it will be available and<br>we're going to make sure that it's in<br>hard copy it's online it's not quite<br>going to be Wikipedia but I am going to<br>make sure that all of the people who are<br>contributing things to it keep it up to<br>dat because they are generating this<br>material and they want people to read it<br>and so I hope that as a consequence of<br>this lecture tonight you think a little<br>bit differently about the future of New<br>Zealand about what it means to be a New<br>Zealander and about the issues that we<br>are facing because we're either part of<br>the problem we're part of the solution I<br>hope all the people here tonight came<br>because you want to be part of the<br>solution I do too that's why I don't<br>know how many prob Bono hours we put<br>into it now but lots and I have found<br>this extremely interesting and I hope<br>that when you get the study and read it<br>you will find it interesting and helpful<br>you we now have an opportunity for<br>begin questions or comments question or<br>comments and I know some of you so I<br>you great<br>yes just wondering hello who are<br>you<br>Leo some<br>of excellent Leo so just considering the<br>current demographic trend what do you<br>think what's your vision for New Zealand<br>20 years from now I think that New<br>Zealand needs to use all of its diverse<br>people as<br>Bridges some there are people like you<br>and I Leo we've been in the country a<br>long time we are passionate new<br>zealanders we speak good English we<br>understand the culture<br>here and we are bridges between uh the<br>recent migrants and between the<br>established population in New Zealand<br>and I mean that's partly why set up New<br>Zealand Asian leaders my vision is that<br>we get on like a house on fire actually<br>my vision is that I can continue to live<br>in this country because it is peaceful<br>and that my son who is Eurasian will<br>grow up in peace and will not be bullied<br>because he is half Chinese and half<br>British so I think this can be done but<br>I don't think the status quo is<br>sustainable I don't think we can just<br>keep these Trends going and going and<br>going and not do anything on the basis<br>said if we ignore it it will go away it<br>may be that way for people who are not<br>diverse but for people like you and I<br>actually it is getting harder out there<br>so something needs to be done and uh I'm<br>trying to do my bit by having New<br>Zealand Asian leaders for example just<br>profiling what new zealanders do but<br>also just saying to everybody if you're<br>losing market share you might want to<br>look at your customer base and once<br>you've looked at your customer base you<br>might want to reflect on who you are<br>hiring in your place of work and then<br>you might want want to stop rejecting<br>all those CVS from people called my chin<br>no actually it's May Chin I am going to<br>change my name by Deo I do want it to be<br>said properly one day um but but that's<br>what I think and I think that we can use<br>our technical schools I at 30 years in<br>law that I can bring to the discussion<br>and it's wonderful today I was on the<br>phone with four top civil servants in<br>Wellington Dr M uh mvin Singham who's uh<br>Deputy uh CEO of the Department of<br>internal affairs Pam D very high<br>official in the Ministry of Foreign<br>Affairs and trade Tim in director of<br>macroeconomics at the treasury Belinda<br>chin CEO of capital and Coast<br>THB we're bringing together all of the<br>officials uh because at the moment the<br>director of talent in Wellington is<br>focused in the state Services Commission<br>is focused on gender so we're just going<br>to move right along to diversity uh<br>ethnicity um so I just think there's a<br>great deal that can be done and uh a lot<br>of it is just predicting what's going to<br>happen understanding the challenges and<br>then making some changes to adapt<br>because remember Darwin said the race is<br>not to the strong and it is not to the<br>smart but it is to the most<br>adaptable any other questions<br>coms Steve thanks for great talk do you<br>agree that New Zealand would benefit<br>from population brought about through<br>brought about by migration I I amum I am<br>uh agnostic on immigration policy I<br>think that it is the right The Sovereign<br>right of every state to determine who<br>enters the country and on what terms<br>we're currently reviewing immigration<br>policy so not surprisingly we're letting<br>two sorts of immigrants come into the<br>country one batch that are highly<br>skilled and one batch that have lots of<br>money basically to invest in things so<br>uh that seems to be that I can<br>understand why you would do that that<br>seems rational but it's a discussion we<br>need to continue to have with the<br>population I think the only thing is not<br>to presume that the diverse think that<br>we should have<br>unmitigated uh diversity at a fast rate<br>the reality is that it doesn't help us<br>if there are is there's such a challenge<br>on Social Capital that the amount of<br>discrimination just Rockets because that<br>makes it unpleasant for the rest of us<br>who are actually here so when people<br>want to search my bag when I come across<br>the border is it your first time in New<br>Zealand where do you come from remuera<br>you know it's it's it's just it's a<br>little trying that's all uh and and it<br>is hard because the difficulty is you<br>know we've been told that the Oakland<br>house prices are because of all the<br>these Asians these new migrants well if<br>I turn up am I a new migrant I don't<br>think I'm new but you see they can't to<br>tell the difference because we look<br>different so that's the issue and I have<br>to say that I think the issue is<br>different for me than the issue is for<br>second or third or fourth or fifth<br>generation new zealanders they were born<br>here uh this has always been their<br>country and so there is nowhere else for<br>them to go home really<br>sir he's a fabulous doctor Yes dear<br>we're seeing a bit of tension at the<br>moment between government and the<br>council parh for the first time isues<br>like housing and transport there's a lot<br>of media back and forth between the two<br>how do you see that planning<br>out I think that central government and<br>ockland need to adapt to each other um<br>did you watch Captain America do you<br>know how he started he was kind of un<br>and then they put him on a machine and<br>he sort of blew up you know I mean<br>Oakland used to be eight Tas in a<br>regional kind of having a lot of fights<br>with each other really um and then it<br>became one and now we have 10,000<br>officials and it's it's a very big<br>number and so there's an adjustment<br>going on here between Oakland and<br>Wellington uh but you know we've 40% of<br>the cabinet lives in Oakland so I'm<br>quite hopeful about the ability of the<br>government to get its head around that<br>equation and at the end of the day the<br>government does have to win Oakland and<br>the reality is that orlanders don't much<br>like it when when their own Council<br>regardless of the fact that they think<br>their own council's useless their own<br>Council has been dealt with like that by<br>central government so I I think we<br>should all just be patient I think<br>people are adjusting to the difference<br>in size and power and leverage that the<br>parties have but at the end of the day<br>when push comes to shove no doubt when<br>election year happens they'll all sort<br>it out um they have to really because<br>let me tell you at the rate of Oakland's<br>growth we're not going to<br>fit uh we're going to end up gridlocked<br>I mean I've just come back from London<br>where I was studying urbanization and uh<br>super diversity and uh and a super City<br>I mean London is growing by 2 million uh<br>they they've got to find somewhere to<br>put all these people they have to sort<br>their problems and obviously Boris is<br>off to be prime minister soon but um he<br>spoke to us and it's just interesting<br>look at their issues versus our super<br>City issues I mean to be honest we we<br>we've dealt with quite a few of them<br>just by by by putting them all into into<br>one entity it was interesting I was<br>doing a webinar today it was supposed to<br>be about the public law toolbox but they<br>they wanted to know about super<br>diversity and why it was relevant to<br>lawyers what it's hugely relevant to<br>lawyers your client base has just<br>changed and all the issues have changed<br>uh and and one of the issues is going to<br>be religious diversity in what happens<br>in schools I mean I just read out all<br>those issues I couldn't talk to you<br>about there there dime a dozen lots of<br>them um earlier oh sorry my name is<br>marota um earlier you spoke about uh<br>practices and some practices being a bit<br>different uh such as some expectations<br>of uh sort of<br>illegality and um I thought around<br>values and whether or not New Zealand's<br>mature enough to have those<br>conversations around values and if so<br>how would we begin that that<br>conversation<br>I think actually we begin uh by uh all<br>people of diversity realizing that<br>they're no longer a minority that<br>actually they're about to become a<br>majority I think they should feel<br>confident in who they are they<br>passionate new zealanders and I think<br>that they need to talk to other new<br>zealanders and not pretend that they're<br>not Asian or Pacifica or Mari so I think<br>actually that's where it starts it<br>doesn't start with you know the<br>government putting a million dollars<br>into a Hy I think it starts actually you<br>know recently I wrote in the hero and I<br>gave kudos to the Prime Minister I<br>wasn't being political I just was giving<br>credit where credit was due when we got<br>attacked he was the only one that's that<br>that came out and said well that's not<br>the right thing to do now actually quite<br>a lot can be done which is not<br>regulatory intervention um quite a lot<br>can be done just by signaling that<br>actually it's all right you know and you<br>shouldn't treat people like this and<br>actually the fun fundamental value of<br>new zealanders there's a book written<br>about this by a Harvard graduate it<br>compares the American value system with<br>the New Zealand value system it's in the<br>super diversity stockt and what it finds<br>is that whereas uh the American uh<br>culture is all about success the New<br>Zealand culture is all about fairness<br>that's what underlies the culture and<br>that's why it's fundamentally different<br>from the American culture okay Nina<br>there who also went to Harvard it's that<br>and so I just think we're very fortunate<br>um we're not Australia we're not other<br>countries we're New Zealand and in this<br>country actually the fundamental uh<br>value that underlies this Society is<br>fairness so it's good because when<br>people ask me what my vision is I only<br>really have one and that is that all<br>people should be treated with dignity<br>and respect that all people should be<br>treated on the basis of Merit and not on<br>criteria</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
