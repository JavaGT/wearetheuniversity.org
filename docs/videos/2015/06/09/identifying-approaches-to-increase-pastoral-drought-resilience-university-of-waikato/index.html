He's comparing the seasonal water use of mixed-sward pasture systems (a combination of different grass, legume and herb species) with more traditional ryegrass/clover systems under dairy grazing.<br><br>Click here to read more about this project: http://bit.ly/1KIjCP2.<br><br>Visit the University of Waikato in the Premier Feature at this year's National Fieldays.

accurate.</p><p>hi I'm Aaron W I'm a research technician<br>working on so carbon project with Lou<br>shipper and other people so I studied at<br>wo in the early 2000s did a MSC with<br>Dave Campbell who's also part of this<br>project so the research we're trying to<br>do here is check is also involved with<br>is we're trying to determine how or how<br>we can increase the amount of carbon in<br>the soil and our particular way of<br>looking at this is looking at whether a<br>mixed sword or diverse pasture of<br>deeping species along with r Rass and<br>clover can help uh Quest more carbon<br>from the atmosphere So This research has<br>been going now for we've been on this<br>farm for 3 and 1/2 years uh of that the<br>first year and a half we sort of initial<br>period of where we were just monitoring<br>before we made any changes at all to get<br>a baseline some baseline value<br>uh we then went through a regassing<br>period two 2 years ago uh and we've<br>since been monitoring since set for the<br>last 2 years we're now at a point where<br>we can probably start to make some<br>conclusions um in terms of where we're<br>at we have funding for another two years<br>at this point and we will carry on<br>measuring for two more years the way<br>this experiment will work we're not<br>going to get any definitive answers for<br>a long period of time it's not something<br>we can get a quick answer for so the<br>long we can stay here in measure the<br>better we'll be the more sure we'll be<br>able to come to down conclusions all<br>right so I'm Jack bronger um I started<br>doing BC at University of wo in 2007 and<br>then in the third year I started getting<br>involved with shipper and working under<br>him a little bit and so the trial was<br>essentially set up but but it was<br>focused on carbon and we me collecting<br>water data but no one was using it so it<br>was an ideal opportunity for me to get<br>involved initially focusing on<br>evaporation from the p FES looking at<br>how they use water differently what how<br>the seasonal CRS change and then I want<br>to bring in water sufficiency which is<br>how much water is evaporated to how much<br>carbon has taken up and obviously if you<br>can increase the efficiency that you use<br>water then you're likely to save water<br>earlier in the season and be able to<br>push into the dry season further so I'm<br>interested in water use and water use<br>efficiency of um paral systems and we<br>we're noticing that and I think the<br>farmers are especially noticing this<br>that we're getting more and more<br>droughts and<br>climate change is essentially accepted<br>so we need to work Farm systems towards<br>coping with these drve periods here know<br>and we've just noticed by looking around<br>that a number of farmers are sort of<br>experimenting with mix WS on their own<br>which is using deeper Ro including past<br>like chory and plantain and they do push<br>into the dry periods further so the FL<br>Fellowship is a very generous<br>scholarship that's um donated by Bill FL<br>and family and he's really looking<br>looking for people who are advancing<br>industry I guess they making a<br>difference and so I put an application<br>in for it um obviously got it because of<br>the Agricultural focus of my study and<br>it has really it has made a big<br>difference as money towards operating<br>and also money towards living well I'm<br>out here approximately every 10 to 14<br>days measuring pasture growth um we're<br>out here today cutting grass so we<br>monitoring plast production using CAG<br>gluing<br>cages and that varies from every 20 days<br>to 60 plus days in Winter essentially<br>we've got three areas where we're<br>dealing with we've got three of these<br>Edco variance TOS which are measuring<br>the exchange of water and carbon so<br>there's one here and this is a site<br>that's been resign into Rass so spray<br>out and resign there's an old Ry grass<br>site down the back of the farm which is<br>just we haven't simply just established<br>the tower and we're measuring over that<br>and then there's the mix w<br>right down the back there where the<br>rth pasture was spray out and the new<br>mix was being established so<br>essentially while I'm focused on the new<br>rth and the new mix sword we've got<br>ultimate control down the backy which<br>has been nothing done to it so we can<br>just see what would have happened if we<br>had have not changed anything okay so<br>we've got a Sonic anemometer which<br>measures the wind speed very quickly so<br>we're measuring at 20 HZ so that's 20<br>times per second and we also have uh CO2<br>water gas analyzer so they measure the<br>gas exchange between the atmosphere and<br>the soil for both CO2 and water that's<br>also measuring at the same speed 20 H so<br>very quickly uh the one advantage of<br>these instruments is we're able to<br>measure over a large area so we're stand<br>in the middle of three Pedic site and we<br>believe we're measuring more or less<br>over that area so so with our Edco<br>variance system we measure the CO2<br>obiously leaving the ground and being<br>taken up by the plants for<br>photosynthesis so respiration from the<br>ground from the atmosphere one of the<br>problems we have with ovarian technique<br>is when it's very calm still non windy<br>day we struggle to measure it there's a<br>few issues around that and this often<br>happens particularly at night time uh at<br>night time there's very little<br>photosynthesis happening there's no<br>sunlight for the plants so there's<br>mainly respiration but what the chambers<br>they enable us to do is they measure<br>respiration so they just measure what's<br>coming out of the out of the soil in the<br>plants to the atmosphere and they will<br>work under any conditions time or<br>daytime so it kind of helps us to fill<br>in the gaps a little bit in terms of the<br>amount of CO2 exchange particularly at<br>night time I guess the main thing from<br>my personal perspective that we're<br>trying to get out of this is we're<br>trying to<br>improve the environment and at the same<br>time improve things for Farmers we can<br>change the system how we want but if if<br>it reduces amount of grass that<br>farmers's grow H amount of milk they<br>produce they're not going to be<br>interested in it so we have to be able<br>to prove that we can produce the same<br>amount of pasture from E the system so<br>the the the the most interesting thing<br>that's came out of my research so far as<br>I said I'm beginning by focusing on<br>evaporation is that the mix SW pasture<br>which includes Chum plantain and lucern<br>over the first 12- month period that it<br>s evaporated less water than the Ry<br>grass system while producing the same<br>amount of biomass for the animals<br>grazing This research has the potential<br>to increase pasture production into dry<br>period so I should be able to from the<br>measurements we are doing we should<br>ultimately end up being able to tweak<br>systems so that they perform at their<br>Peak and use water most efficiently to<br>push further into routs so for this is<br>going to be important moving forward for<br>Farmers because as they already noticed<br>we've had three dry years in a row and<br>there's probably more to come and so<br>there's potentially quite an economic<br>farmers</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
