How much do you trust the advice and medicine you receive? How do you treat people with mental illness? And is depression the pandemic of the 21st century? These are some of the questions raised by the social history of medicine, the topic of a free public lecture at the University of Waikato.<br><br>To see our upcoming Inaugural Professorial Lectures,

unity in 1999 as a lecturer appointed<br>to teach history Australian history and<br>history of<br>medicine in the time Kathy<br>has resarch and standard resarch and<br>quickly emerged as a research leader<br>University she's published three so<br>books the<br>first reading men's gender indifference<br>in the colonial asylum in Victoria<br>Australia 1848 to 1880 was published in<br>2007 and was followed closely by Madness<br>in the family insanity and institutions<br>in the Australian Colonial World 1860 to<br>19 194 published in<br>2010 her most recent book Insanity<br>identity and Empire Colonial<br>institutional confinement in Australia<br>and New Zealand 1870 to 1910 is<br>currently in print and due for release<br>in<br>October she's also contributed more than<br>six edited books and published more than<br>40 chapters and<br>articles since coming to the University<br>of wart<br>Kathy has developed her research and<br>medical history with a local<br>flavor in 2012 Kathy assisted the wado<br>medic mental health research group to<br>co-edit a book on the changing face of<br>toono psychiatric hospital projects like<br>this have helped Kathy to develop a<br>network of relationships with local dhbs<br>and healthc Care<br>practitioners and she says community<br>outreach is a vital part of her academic<br>career<br>Kathy's research covers a much broader<br>area of History than medicine and health<br>she has an interest in 19th century<br>imperialism and colonialism particularly<br>in Australia and New Zealand in 2012 she<br>co-edited law history and colonialism<br>the reach of Empire along with Professor<br>Diane Kirby of latro<br>University she also has an interest in<br>digital history and one of her students<br>will be live tweeting from her inaugural<br>lecture tonight um but for everyone else<br>no playing with your phones please<br>lecture Kathy was co-editor of<br>Australian historical studies the<br>leading National Journal of Australian<br>history and is currently co-editor of<br>health and history a journal with a wide<br>audience including health and Medicine<br>researchers as well as the book series<br>mental health and historical<br>perspective she served as president<br>president of the Australian New Zealand<br>law and History Society and the New<br>Zealand historical<br>Association she's also within the UN<br>University been associate Dean graduate<br>and postgraduate for the faculty of arts<br>years so tonight's lecture the title is<br>present Kathy will be looking at what<br>and who are the subjects of medical<br>knowledge how did past generations of<br>people understand illness in their own<br>historical context what language did<br>they give to their symptoms and how was<br>it<br>understood she'll be exploring how<br>social and cultural histories of<br>medicine health and institutions have<br>the potential to challenge and reshape<br>medicine in our present ladies and<br>gentlemen will you please please welcome<br>Professor Kathy colbourne to give her<br>inaugural professorial<br>lecture Chancellor Deputy Vice<br>Chancellor Dean<br>Oto man<br>Board Vice Chancellor Dean special and<br>distinguished guests including those<br>from the wut dhb members of the w Health<br>memorabilia trust who are here tonight<br>colleagues friends students and family<br>our first want to thank the university<br>leadership for the opportunity to the<br>university community and the public<br>about my<br>research I'd also like to use this<br>moment before I begin to briefly thank<br>my former and current colleagues in<br>history over<br>the whove provided an Innovative<br>teaching and research cont text our<br>several Collective strengths and our<br>excellent students continue to remind me<br>of the value and purpose of historical<br>study and thanks too to my wider<br>community of research colleagues in The<br>Faculty across a variety of disciplines<br>and in other parts of the university for<br>their support their friendship and for<br>affording me with many opportunities to<br>participate in the life of the<br>institution and I'm also really lucky to<br>have great research collaborators and<br>friends in history around New Zealand<br>and Australia and further a field and<br>all of those people are an important<br>source of<br>inspiration a few mentors during my time<br>here at wau stand out for their<br>assistance it's really difficult to<br>mention everyone but I do want to single<br>out my former history colleagues Peter<br>Gibbons and Anna green Emeritus<br>Professor dick Bedford who when he was<br>DVC or Deputy Vice Chancellor research<br>encouraged me to keep applying for<br>external research funding and Emeritus<br>Professor Michael Selby who a very long<br>time ago now put me in touch with the<br>wado Medical Research Foundation and uh<br>Peter Rothwell who's here tonight and I<br>were just talking about that before I<br>came in for five years I played a role<br>as their archist and wrote their Short<br>History which was published in<br>2000 to Professor Robin Longhurst for<br>for her continual wise guidance<br>generosity and mentoring especially<br>around this evening to my friends and<br>family sincere thanks to my parents<br>Brian and Patricia my sister Michaela<br>and her family and my partner Craig and<br>our daughter Cassidy who I can see<br>there finally if you see someone as the<br>vice chancellor has said looking like<br>she's being disruptive on a mobile<br>device it might be Chelsea tweeting for<br>me so thank you very much<br>Chelsea so what and who are the subjects<br>of medical<br>knowledge use that word subjects to mean<br>both topics and also all of us as the<br>subjects of medical<br>inquiry and how did past generations of<br>people understand illness in their own<br>historical<br>context what language did they give to<br>their symptoms how is it<br>understood what I want to do here in<br>this lecture is to take examples from<br>the histories of health and medicine to<br>Showcase what is a vibrant and important<br>critical field of study and its local<br>National and international relevance<br>today in particular I will share aspects<br>of my research in the field of histories<br>of mental health such as interpreting<br>psychiatric clinical<br>cases stories of families and<br>psychiatric<br>institutions and collaborative histories<br>of mental ill<br>illness this account of medical subjects<br>reminds us of the value of the medical<br>Humanities to science technology and<br>Medicine in education and public<br>life and what I want to do here is to<br>invite all of us to see medicine as<br>inherently social as well as to reassert<br>the value of historical<br>research now I know this is a very broad<br>topic and I won't be able to cover every<br>facet but for me put simply medical<br>Humanities is a set of combined<br>interdisciplinary approaches to Medical<br>Education what can disciplines such as<br>history anthropology philosophy or<br>Creative and Performing Arts add to our<br>understandings of health and<br>medicine as recently noted in a new<br>special issue of the journal medical<br>Humanities the Arts Humanities and<br>social science Es are best viewed not in<br>service or in opposition to the clinical<br>and Life Sciences but as entangled with<br>a biomedical<br>culture it's really uh a great pleasure<br>for me to do this kind of research<br>because for a very long time now<br>probably since the early 1990s when I<br>was doing my Master's thesis uh in early<br>modern British history at the University<br>of Melbourne I've been really captivated<br>by the social histories of health and<br>medicine it's a rich diverse and<br>inherently interdisciplinary field of<br>inquiry with practitioners all over the<br>world and that's another part of its<br>appeal it also has an appeal perhaps<br>because health and illness are Universal<br>subjects we all experience illness at<br>some stage in our<br>lives so making links between our<br>present experiences of Health its<br>systems its modes of healing its drug<br>therapies and disease<br>itself like those of people in the past<br>takes a smaller imaginative leap than we<br>might<br>expect I argue that the cultures of<br>health and Medicine are best understood<br>Health imagine your most recent medical<br>encounter perhaps you visited a general<br>practitioner<br>or had a vaccination or perhaps you took<br>a child for a<br>vaccination you might have had to see a<br>specialist or have a scan perhaps you<br>advocated for a relative an elderly<br>person<br>unwell you went to a hospital and<br>visited<br>someone as a sick person you came up<br>with language for the GP I have a sore<br>throat a headache I'm very<br>tired these days and at this time of the<br>year you might have have already checked<br>your symptoms online and Googled<br>symptoms of<br>flu thinking about this language your<br>encounter with your doctor you imagine<br>trying to communicate how you feel in<br>your body and I think we all do this in<br>the waiting room what am I going to say<br>a vague persistent ache in the knee the<br>type of cough you have using language<br>that's often<br>imprecise it can be difficult to express<br>how you<br>feel doctors for their part are trained<br>to listen carefully and to hear your<br>personal narrative of sickness turning<br>it into a clinical assessment<br>treatment my research seeks to examine<br>the medical Encounters of the<br>past this dialogue between patient and<br>practitioner sick person and healer<br>sufferer and physician is the focus of<br>most of my research in the history of<br>mental<br>illness the communication between those<br>experiencing mental illness symptoms as<br>defined at any given time in history and<br>culture is often<br>mediated the conversation with a<br>physician might be prompted by a family<br>member the police or a member of the<br>community this dialogue is complex and<br>usually involves different players more<br>than one voice and it can also be framed<br>not only by medical ideas but also by<br>legal ones mental illness is not alone<br>among illness conditions in this regard<br>for instance notifiable diseases but it<br>is<br>unusual in<br>1877 this woman was taken by police to<br>the institution known as the<br>Asylum this image caught my eye when I<br>was conducting Research into the<br>relationship between families<br>institutions and people with mental<br>illness in New Zealand and Australia<br>it's a woodcut and it was published in<br>the police news uh a publication in<br>Victoria this woman Mrs Anderson was<br>taken from Cape shank in coastal<br>Victoria near gibsland where I grew up<br>to the hospital for the insane in<br>Metropolitan<br>Melbourne her story of Madness a word I<br>use deliberately here as you'll see<br>later was told in the public remain once<br>committed to the institution she was<br>written about and described and defined<br>as insane in the official public<br>record yet like others arrested as<br>insane Mrs Anderson did have a family<br>who cared about her and who interceded<br>on her behalf the manner of her<br>apprehension and transport to the<br>institution looks rough and even violent<br>to us there were concerns even then<br>about the physical restraint used on<br>such<br>people mental health professionals<br>instead advocated moral treatment of the<br>insane work therapy regular exposure to<br>religious Services Leisure Pursuits for<br>the well patience and calm beautiful<br>surroundings however with large<br>institutions of the late 19th century<br>becoming heavily crowded with inmates<br>with chronic conditions there was little<br>space or time to dedicate to their care<br>and treatment so the reality tended to<br>be that the ideal Asylum was only<br>imagined especially in the institutions<br>Zealand that image became the cover of<br>my book on the subject of families<br>Madness and<br>institutions published in 2010 this work<br>examined the case records of patients in<br>four large public hospitals to<br>1910 it was the result of more than a<br>decade of thinking about Colonial<br>histories of mental illness it stemmed<br>from my doctoral work but took a<br>significantly new approach to the topic<br>because in that PhD I had very<br>tentatively looked at the concept of<br>resistance among<br>patients but in the new project some<br>years later I Advanced the idea that the<br>institution was not an entirely closed<br>or forbidding<br>place and that's significant I think<br>because the dominant story about<br>the so-called madous or Asylum tends to<br>suggest that these institutions became<br>dumping grounds custodial places where<br>people were simply<br>forgotten to some extent this is<br>true ideas about mental illness and the<br>Brain were not sufficiently worked out<br>just as they are contested<br>today some very unwell people had become<br>problematic in their communities either<br>because of their unwanted behaviors or<br>organic disease which made them<br>physically and mentally incapable or<br>because social expectations of women and<br>men were such that the institutions were<br>imagined as the best place for them I<br>condone none of these ideas yet they<br>need to be understood historically in<br>time and<br>place in our present context an era<br>following the widespread closures of<br>Mental Hospitals many of them<br>established in the 19th century public<br>debate about the relevance and efficacy<br>of these institutions has highlighted<br>the roles of families in the process of<br>caring for those with mental illness<br>many families in the present struggle<br>with their perceived lack of help and<br>make use of community and non-government<br>organizations in their efforts to cope<br>with a variety of mental health<br>problems my sense about the past was<br>that many inmates had families and<br>friends who were doing their best to<br>engage with in institutions and their<br>modes of care and in fact this was<br>supported by the evidence I located for<br>this study and it also aligned with<br>arguments made by historians in other<br>places so I set out to look at not only<br>patient clinical case notes but at also<br>sorry also at other sources of evidence<br>these were needed to show whether family<br>members or individual patients were able<br>to engage in a dialogue with doctors or<br>intendant I used collections of family<br>letters visitors books particularly at<br>Oakland uh the institution at Oakland<br>that I<br>studied registers of trial leave and<br>absence where patients were coming and<br>going from institutions quite<br>regularly I found evidence of the police<br>tracing families for maintenance<br>payments for institutional care uh this<br>was a concept that people would make<br>payments but of course not many people<br>could afford to<br>and I also examined Aftercare<br>organizations that operated in some<br>settled Urban contexts by the early 20th<br>century and I also very carefully<br>examined the patient cases and personal<br>letters for example for evidence of a<br>discussion about family advocacy as well<br>as for ideas about how people described<br>their own symptoms or those of a family<br>member given this evidence I drew the<br>conclusion that the institution wasn't<br>in fact quite permeable its walls<br>allowed people both inside and outside<br>we think of this concept of the<br>revolving door as a very 20th century<br>phenomenon but there were many people<br>like Steven who at the age of 41 had<br>multiple periods of leave of absence<br>from Oakland mental hospital as it was<br>then known in the early<br>1900s regular visitors many many and was<br>both discharged and readmitted for<br>spells of institutional care so there<br>institution I must admit I just find<br>this<br>fascinating and clinical medicine and<br>its tools of observation really<br>developed inside medical institutions<br>such as Mental Hospitals in the late<br>19th century these were quite captive<br>populations in some<br>respects so people could study what was<br>going on inside them and so in this<br>project I developed a keen interest in<br>the history of symptomatology listing<br>and classifying these as lay<br>observations uh of mental<br>breakdown I don't expect you to really<br>read what's on this slide it's a section<br>from an appendix in my book and I did go<br>through and I pulled out all of the<br>symptoms that I saw listed by family<br>members or noted in the case<br>records of interest is the fact that the<br>word Depression was emerging in this<br>period it wasn't used very often it did<br>appear<br>uh and it appeared in medical advice<br>books in the 1860s but it really wasn't<br>century the very consistent question<br>which drives my research in this field<br>is how can historians make sense of the<br>clinical case as a narrative of<br>illness what can patient histories tell<br>us how do we read and interpret<br>them what interested me in the project<br>I've just described was the World<br>revealed in the clinical Pages the<br>comments from families literally<br>scribbled in the margins of the case<br>notes transcribed from families the<br>fragments of interaction and<br>conversations between families and<br>doctors or the writings of those people<br>who were themselves<br>confined This research found out new<br>things about the layered and contested<br>nature of the medical encounter and the<br>narratives around<br>it<br>in my more recent project I turned<br>relatively small collection of patient<br>case data that I've just been talking<br>about to a very large sample of almost<br>4,000<br>cases now this has presented several new<br>challenges of interpretation<br>particularly for somebody who didn't<br>really um understand quantitative<br>history when I<br>began I've argued here that clinical<br>case records produced social identities<br>for those those who were<br>institutionalized forms of social<br>difference gender class ethnicity<br>sexuality were important to<br>contemporaries telling the stories of<br>individuals as opposed to the stories of<br>groups Collective experiences as<br>patented by the data collated for the<br>study has involved negotiating a very<br>tense boundary between different forms<br>of historical narrative historical<br>writing and what I've really focused on<br>here is the stories of very mobile<br>migrants from the British AES and Europe<br>and some other places and the fact that<br>poverty led to<br>institutionalization not only in the<br>hospitals for the so-called insane but<br>also in welfare<br>institutions but I was also able to<br>follow up this interest I had in<br>symptomatology and<br>diagnosis and that was great because I<br>had a large sample of data I could<br>actually make some other um assumptions<br>or draw some different<br>conclusions and again I don't expect you<br>to analyze this but it's an example of<br>diagnosis now all of this work could be<br>said to have emerged from what was then<br>a new agenda in the social history of<br>medicine in the mid<br>1980s historian Roy Porter wrote<br>suggestively about medicine from Below<br>in the midst of a social history<br>movement with socalled ordinary people's<br>histories all of us this movement was<br>driven by Marxist histories of class<br>class structures and society and it<br>intersected with women's and feminist<br>history as well as histories of<br>colonized<br>peoples the examples Porter gave were<br>from the early modern worlds of diarists<br>popular culture and written remedies and<br>popular beliefs about<br>illness there have been a number of<br>historians I'm very envious of who've<br>been really lucky to discover and use<br>the detailed medical records of for<br>instance a magical healer in 17th<br>century England that's one of my<br>favorite books of all time it's called<br>mystical<br>bedum the writings of a male Midwife and<br>his interaction with a local woman who<br>delivered other women's babies in an<br>18th century German Town or 20th century<br>clinical cases from the National Women's<br>Hospital in Melbourne all of these<br>historians have written really uh<br>stunning books about the stories of<br>patients those histories from from below<br>and they've made significant Headway in<br>medical histories of the sufferer that<br>are instruct imagining of the<br>sick sometimes we have to go outside<br>institutions to write histories of<br>health and illness and we have to look<br>at private<br>writings in different research I suggest<br>that Colonial cultures of Health in<br>families and communities of care offer<br>other insights about lay knowledge of<br>health and<br>disease in a very broad chapter about<br>health and Medicine covering the period<br>1840 to the end of the 20th century uh<br>that I wrote for the New Oxford history<br>of New Zealand I presented my view that<br>New Zealand's history of Health had to<br>be read as one of a series of medical<br>encounters and exchanges across cultures<br>for example between Mii and pakha<br>between old world ideas and new Colonial<br>experiences to name just<br>two the idea of a vocabulary of Health<br>has been the subject of a few<br>significant pieces of scholarship in<br>Australia and New Zealand so how did<br>people talk about their ordinary um<br>Health<br>experiences many people had lay<br>knowledge of medical techniques and<br>contemporary treatments as well as<br>harboring their own theories and giving<br>their own meanings to illness<br>experiences as we still<br>do and I've tried to argue too that<br>understandings of somatic illness are<br>critical to understanding whether there<br>is a relationship between expressions of<br>mental and physical<br>illness we see here that some of Roy<br>Porter's findings about the cultures and<br>the social worlds of health and healing<br>about an earlier period of History also<br>apply to 200 years later with 19th<br>century colonial Europeans growing and<br>using medicinal herbs and a medical<br>Market Place populated by herbalists and<br>many others not just Colonial doctors<br>most of them who were themselves<br>migrants trained in Scotland and England<br>who were said at the time to be as<br>plentiful as<br>blackberries Dr Joan a bishop who's here<br>tonight who recently graduated with a<br>PhD in history under the chief<br>supervision of my colleague James Bey<br>examined Colonial practices of health<br>and gender and domestic practices of<br>healing as part of her thesis on the use<br>of medicinal plants in Colonial New<br>Zealand and my colleague James and I<br>find many links between environmental<br>histories and histories of Health as his<br>shows I've mentioned Joanna's<br>work Joe's work to purposefully turn to<br>teaching graduate students how to<br>research in the social histories of<br>health and<br>medicine I've just got a couple of<br>examples here of the book covers uh that<br>my students have produced work<br>in when they've taken my taught paper<br>sickness and health in history students<br>of the social history of medicine here<br>at the University have produced a wealth<br>of new knowledge about sickness and<br>health in the past and I've encouraged<br>them to publish this work in these small<br>booklets uh at honors level and Master's<br>level and many of those students also<br>became doctoral students in history and<br>they've found a wealth of possibilities<br>in 20th century medical histories of<br>practitioners training and illness<br>conditions student research has touched<br>on public health intellectual disability<br>mental health path graphies and M mental<br>health and illness to name a<br>few the middle uh book cover there is Dr<br>John Armstrong who in fact wrote that<br>book before he did his Doctorate in<br>history and he was working with the<br>wadoo health memorabilia trust who are<br>here tonight and I'll talk about them in<br>a moment I was just chatting again with<br>uh Dr Peter Rothwell now his book um<br>written about wado hospital has sold<br>almost 800 copies which is um pretty<br>incredible for a work of history and<br>academic publishing never really um<br>reaches those Heights so John did very<br>well with that book showing the great<br>interest I think in histories of Doctors<br>Medical practice and so on he went on to<br>do his PhD focused on medical migration<br>and medical training using oral<br>histories of New Zealand<br>doctors and my student Cheryl wear who's<br>now a doctoral candidate at mcari<br>University in Sydney produced her<br>master's thesis here in history and um<br>undertook quite innovative research<br>examining the oral narratives of men<br>living with HIV AIDS after<br>1980 and oral his history again is a<br>strong feature of our teaching and<br>research in history here at wau under<br>the expert leadership of my colleague<br>nepia<br>Maha so together I think we have<br>incredible strengths in the way we we<br>come together to teach and supervise our<br>students how should we understand all of<br>this research in the context of the<br>medical<br>Humanities at last year's Society for<br>the social history of medicine<br>conference hosted by Oxford Brooks<br>University in Oxford Professor Paul<br>wendling's opening remarks focused on a<br>still newer agenda for the social<br>history of<br>medicine driven in part by the<br>imperative for the humanity subjects to<br>become more relevant one could be<br>forgiven for thinking the focus of his<br>comments was shaped by outside<br>perceptions of history as a<br>discipline windling said that<br>increasingly historians of medicine and<br>health were charged with examinations of<br>more recent<br>history our approaches then have to<br>involve increased scrutiny of clinical<br>medicine the oral testimony of health<br>patients standards of treatment and care<br>and a direct engagement with<br>evidence-based<br>medicine historians of medicine he<br>argued are becoming academics with an<br>ethical scientific and public role<br>and he urged us to pursue questions of<br>accountability in medicine as we conduct<br>research wendling's own research has<br>involved questions of European medical<br>refugees in the 20th century such as<br>German Jewish doctors as well as<br>Psychiatry under the Nazi regime and<br>medical atrocities during the second<br>world<br>war his ideas about taking<br>responsibility as historians of medicine<br>are well<br>articulated there's a long-standing<br>relationship and dialogue between<br>medicine and Society they are<br>inseparable<br>intertwined Medical Science derives from<br>its social context it's socially<br>produced and it's given meaning at<br>specific<br>times the important and vital work of<br>medical historians in the 1930s and<br>again in the post-war period such as the<br>work of European American historian<br>Henry curist remind us of the value of a<br>social awareness of disease health and<br>medicine from the point of view of both<br>culture and socioeconomic status and the<br>terms social medicine and social<br>Psychiatry were coined in the um<br>post-war period they became Hallmarks of<br>these Endeavors to connect social<br>questions to Scientific and medical<br>practice and very briefly another<br>example of this theme lies in the<br>teaching of medical history to medical<br>students which again was radicalized<br>after the mid<br>1980s Dutch historian Frank Heisman<br>Advocates teaching medical history to<br>medical students through significant<br>histories of bioethics in their social<br>and cultural<br>contexts talking about bioethics to<br>medical students reminds them that<br>science is not a value-free<br>activity medical history is a thriving<br>discipline in Europe Britain and the US<br>and many of the historians I meet credit<br>the medical Humanities and the new<br>emphasis on medical education uh with<br>this<br>strength I'd like to move now to the<br>role and importance of community<br>engagement just like medical education<br>Community engagement and Outreach is an<br>important part of opening up the past of<br>medicine to<br>scrutiny and historians also need<br>medical collaborators and advisors at<br>times to adequately explain and<br>understand the worlds of past medical<br>techniques and<br>practices so these collaborations are<br>very meaningful and the best examples of<br>this come in the form of funded medical<br>history research units many of these<br>exist in British and American<br>universities and also in Australia most<br>notably at the University of<br>Melbourne mostly but not always attached<br>to universities that have medical<br>schools this example here is the<br>University um venture between Strath<br>Clyde and Caledonian universities in<br>Glasgow and it's the center for the<br>social history Ministry of Health and<br>Healthcare and I visited there in March<br>this year this Research Unit has a very<br>strong focus on oral histories of health<br>and medicine and it's in a fantastically<br>strong position at the moment to bid for<br>externally funded teaching positions in<br>the social history of medicine through<br>the welcome trust and of course these<br>places have different sources of<br>external funding but it's a great model<br>it's a terrific Research Center with a<br>vibrant<br>culture<br>I mentioned earlier that I wrote a very<br>short history of the wakato Medical<br>Research Foundation in my first year or<br>so in the W this role brought me into<br>contact with local medical personnel and<br>institutions and in our own wider<br>Community we now have meaningful medical<br>history connections with the w District<br>Health Board through the W wado Health<br>memorabilia trust and mental health and<br>Addiction<br>Services as an original trustee my role<br>has been since 2004 to provide<br>historical research advice to the trust<br>board and over the years we funded six<br>clinical School summer student ships for<br>history graduates and in 2006 we<br>established the annual Rex right St<br>Clair Memorial lecture in medical<br>history I mention all of this because<br>the work of the trust is on display here<br>this evening and members of the trust<br>who are here tonight Dr Peter Rothwell<br>John Graham and Professor Ross lawrenson<br>I want to make special mention of all of<br>you and the collaboration between us<br>because of all the wonderful things<br>we've been able to do with and for our<br>students my students have been able to<br>gain access to the medical history<br>collection photographic images and the<br>dispersed museum display and it's a<br>really inventive display and we have to<br>really um I think Marvel at Peter<br>rothwell's initiatives here uh he has<br>really driven this through the hospital<br>so that there's<br>in various parts of the hospital there<br>are really interesting displays they're<br>not in one confined small Dusty Medical<br>Museum that people can only visit on<br>Tuesday afternoon uh it's actually<br>everywhere you go through the hospital<br>including a 60m historical timeline on<br>level 2 of the John me Center and it<br>covers 130 years of history and contains<br>226 historical images and out in the<br>foyer out here tonight there are some<br>photographs including of the original p<br>pem maker display um which is a<br>wonderful piece of artwork I think<br>photographs of um Pace pacemakers<br>Through the Ages and usually you don't<br>bodies so I think it's really<br>interesting that the trust didn't want<br>to develop a central museum it operates<br>with this idea of a system of dispersed<br>displays that have themes tell stories<br>and they're in areas of the hospital<br>relevant to their story and accessible<br>so thank you to the members of the trust<br>here<br>tonight I want to return now to my own<br>enduring interest in the history of<br>mental health to<br>conclude it is where society and<br>Medicine converge at their intersection<br>that we find new ways of understanding<br>the histories of medicine and writing<br>these including the histories of mental<br>health and its<br>treatments writing about Psychiatry and<br>mental health in the 20th century or<br>near present presents specific<br>challenges one of the most frequently<br>asked questions I've had at conferences<br>or events in the past few years is<br>whether it's ethical to examine the past<br>medical records of people confined<br>inside<br>institutions Australian historian<br>Professor Steven Garten whose work<br>medicine and Madness inspired me to go<br>on in my field and it's a landmark text<br>in the The Wider discipline<br>has argued strongly for continued access<br>to such records and he says that if<br>historians are shut off from the source<br>we risk not knowing enough about the<br>past of medical treatment institutional<br>care and its efficacy or its<br>problems and histories of psychiatric<br>treatment in the 20th century can now be<br>written but there are obstacles to<br>navigate One Way Forward is for<br>collaborations between institutions<br>doctors nurses mental health care<br>workers service users and administrators<br>and historians such as the large scale<br>collaboration that was known for over 10<br>years as the tokoni<br>project people around me heard me refer<br>to it often this project began with the<br>collection of the oral histories of<br>people associated with toeni Hospital<br>over time following its closure in<br>1998 it became a museum Exhibition at<br>Tia muchu Museum in 2006 called<br>footprints on the land and it grew into<br>a large book project that took around<br>six years to<br>complete working with a team of writers<br>across such disciplinary and<br>experiential divides was the most<br>challenging academic project I've ever<br>completed and possibly the most<br>frustrating but certainly one of the<br>most stimulating I'm convinced now more<br>than ever of the importance of the view<br>from below the everyday familial and<br>professional narratives of mental<br>illness need to be the center of this<br>kind of work so not just people who've<br>uh been institutionalized but also those<br>who've cared for them and worked with<br>them we launched the Book Changing Times<br>changing places in 2012 as you can see<br>there and it was a very significant<br>moment this Collective history<br>collaborative Collective history of<br>tokui and Mental Health Services in the<br>yato has led me to a newer project to<br>engage with the personal stories and<br>narratives of people who were<br>institutionalized in psychiatric<br>institutions in the 20th century and as<br>part of this I'm working with other New<br>Zealand Scholars to produce a new<br>project around mad histories and mad is<br>a word that's been reclaimed by the<br>international network of psychiatric<br>survivors service users and others who<br>identify with those terms used by people<br>with mental illness excuse me there is a<br>mad movement a social movement to write<br>and own the histories of psychiatric<br>institutions it's an interesting moment<br>to step into that<br>story what then can we conclude about<br>history health and the<br>present there's no history when we the<br>public should stop questioning the power<br>of professionals who manage our health<br>our education or other aspects of Social<br>and cultural Life Training our critical<br>Gaze on the critical sorry on the<br>medical establishment has been a vital<br>component of revolutionizing Health and<br>Medical Services of preventing errors<br>and ethical horror of teaching medical<br>students how to be better and how to do<br>no harm we've used our feminist gaze our<br>deeply articulated sense of fairness and<br>Equity about class ethnicity gender and<br>sexuality and we continue to tell<br>medical professionals when we're found<br>Fault With Care<br>treatment but we also use and benefit<br>from the results of medical<br>experimentation this can be a fine line<br>to<br>walk but knowing how to understand<br>medical uh practice and Medicine in<br>historical context is ultimately going<br>to help us make better critical<br>judgments about our present standards of<br>care as well as understanding diagnoses<br>like depression or a range of illnesses<br>of the body and mind in their current<br>you do qu<br>Kathy I'm Robert Henner I'm the dean of<br>the faculty of arts and social sciences<br>and it's my pleasure to give the vote of<br>thanks for Kathy's fascinating well<br>measured and clear<br>lecture all of us have had occasion to<br>go to the doctor and have medical<br>encounters we listen with varying<br>degrees of comprehension to the doctor's<br>diagnosis and come out with more or less<br>understanding of what might be wrong<br>with us and how we might get better my<br>own longstanding<br>family doctor now retired knew that I<br>was an University academic and usually<br>opted to tell me his diagnosis with the<br>full panoply of medical<br>vocabulary I don't know that he knew<br>that I was often distracted by those<br>words being a classicist wondering about<br>their Greek or Latin<br>roots and how they came to mean the<br>thing that he was now describing to me I<br>fear I didn't attend well to the matter<br>in hand the diagnosis and then the<br>prognosis of my<br>illnesses in her inaugural professorial<br>lecture Professor Colburn has talked<br>about how past generations of people<br>understood illness in their own<br>historical context what language they<br>gave to their symptoms and how it was<br>understood by doctors she explored the<br>idea that a disease or illness is often<br>Bound by its time and place in<br>history she demonstrated that how her<br>research has informed her teaching and<br>particularly at the PHD level and her<br>engagement with the wider Community<br>especially with the y c Health um<br>trust the historical context is<br>important in an area like mental illness<br>which has until now been more a matter<br>of pushing those Afflicted to the<br>outskirts of society rather than seeking<br>to integrate them I tend to think coming<br>from the south of New Zealand of the<br>massive pile of building called sea<br>Cliffe which some of you will know uh<br>doesn't exist anymore but it always<br>fascinated me as a youngster the scale<br>of the building and what it said about<br>uh the community that could fill it with<br>people and it was on very much the<br>outskirts of den<br>Eden our language for these illnesses<br>has changed in our own generation to the<br>point as Kathy has told us that the word<br>mad has been reclaimed by the patient<br>Community this idea was also explored by<br>Kathy in an interview on Radio New<br>Zealand just this afternoon and I very<br>much recommend that you go online to<br>Radio New Zealand and listen to it<br>the vice Chancellor mentioned in his<br>introduction that Kathy has a new book<br>out coming in uh coming out in October<br>entitled Insanity identity and Empire<br>Colonial institutional confinement in<br>Australia and New Zealand 1870 to<br>1910 in the forward to this book<br>Emeritus professor John McKenzie talks<br>of how Professor curn has produced a<br>strikingly original and sophisticated<br>book that will advance significant<br>studies in migrant settler and<br>Indigenous mental health issues the<br>sophistication he says lies in her use<br>of a web of concepts of gender class<br>race and ethnicity in specific settler<br>Colonial<br>settings this is High Praise indeed<br>coming from the Doan of the history of<br>popular and cultural<br>imperialism ladies and gentlemen we're<br>fortunate to have a star like Professor<br>curn here at w I ask you to join me in<br>thanking Kathy for a fascinating lecture<br>tonight<br>my last duty is to advise you that the<br>opper bar is open for mixing and<br>mingling and for asking Kathy any<br>specific questions if you wish to thank<br>indeed</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
