it's terrific to be here I think<br>this is not only a great honor in itself<br>to be the Sir Douglas Myers visiting<br>professor but also does this have the<br>opportunity to come here and spend time<br>in New Zealand and enjoy your beautiful<br>country and interact with some of the<br>academics and policy people in<br>Wellington and not to mention people<br>here at Auckland so this has just been a<br>great opportunity for us and we've<br>really enjoyed this so I want to begin<br>by talking about Joseph Heller Joseph<br>Heller one of the great American<br>novelists wrote this novel in 1961 about<br>World War two called catch-22 the term<br>coming into the lexicon of at least<br>American English this is about a young<br>young men who are going on bombing<br>missions flying in bombers during World<br>War two and it's high-risk people were<br>always the planes are being shot down<br>and people are nervous and afraid and<br>some in fact go crazy and it's about<br>this and so here's what Hiller's about<br>the the beauty of catch-22 so he says<br>that there was only one catch and that<br>was catch-22 which specified that a<br>concern for one safety in the face of<br>dangers that were real and immediate was<br>the process of a rational mind or who<br>was one of the pilots or was crazy and<br>could be grounded all he had to do was<br>ask and as soon as he did he would no<br>longer be crazy and would have to fly as<br>more missions or would be crazy to fly<br>more missions and saying if he didn't<br>but if he were saying he had to fly them<br>if he flew them he was crazy and didn't<br>have to but if he didn't want to then he<br>was saying and had to you can see the<br>nature of the logic of this and and I'm<br>going to suggest something similar is at<br>work when it comes to development<br>developing countries have a problem<br>that's very much like this which we call<br>the violence trap and I'm going to talk<br>about that so Adam Smith often thought<br>of as the father of economic<br>who wrote The Wealth of Nations in 1776<br>asked the following question in the book<br>the book is a largely about this and<br>then is what accounts for the very<br>different levels of opulence across the<br>countries of the world why are some rich<br>in some for and in particular why are so<br>many countries so remain poor well it<br>turns out this is a question not only a<br>great interest in Smith's day but also<br>in our day and in fact you can ask the<br>same questions today that Smith it<br>we can also add one and that is why has<br>a trillion dollars in aid from places<br>like the IMF the International Monetary<br>Fund in the World Bank the European Bank<br>for Reconstruction and Development why<br>has so much money led to so little<br>success well there are many problems and<br>many theories of this some people argue<br>that developing countries are missing<br>things so for example they have bad<br>policies they're missing the idea of<br>knowing what to do and so economists can<br>step in and say well don't do what<br>you're doing that's really bad do<br>something else instead another one is<br>that they lack capital that rich places<br>have lots of capital and we we invest<br>and get returns on capital and we're<br>having a lot of capital also raises the<br>productivity of labour and so that's why<br>we're rich and that's why poor countries<br>are poor so what we need to do in that<br>case is simply give them capital another<br>theory has been education human capital<br>as it's called we need to educate them<br>good governance was another and<br>incumbent risk also that that is a<br>politicians themselves don't like the<br>idea of they're worried about being<br>worse off and if they they make choices<br>that make development more likely that<br>makes them more that makes them as<br>politicians incumbents worse off well<br>one of the interesting things about this<br>list is that it's gone serially in terms<br>of there's a historic ranking that this<br>is a time sequence not just a set of<br>independent issues in terms of theories<br>and the reason why economists and<br>development people have gone on is<br>because they're concerned about the fact<br>that the previous theory didn't work and<br>so advice on these ideas simply doesn't<br>produce development so one of the<br>questions is why why is<br>secondary question is why does the<br>development advice not work well I argue<br>that the real problem is the violence<br>trap we'll explain that in a minute this<br>is something that I developed the first<br>part the idea of importance of violence<br>with my colleagues John John Wallace and<br>Doug north in in a 2009 book called<br>violence and social orders where we<br>talked about the importance and<br>prevalence of violence for development<br>in subsequent work with Gary Coxe Doug<br>north and I we've actually formulated<br>the the the idea and formalized the idea<br>of the violence trap which I'll talk to<br>you about and one of the things I want<br>to emphasize for you is that we in the<br>developed world have the luxury of<br>living in a world where we don't have to<br>worry about violence on a daily basis<br>and you can see where 9/11 an event like<br>9/11 changes that and we're there<br>multiple events like 9/11 one every<br>three months the nature of Americans<br>relationship to violence would be very<br>different<br>but luckily that's been relatively<br>isolated and what we fail to see is that<br>violence freedom from violence is a<br>relatively novel thing in the world it's<br>something that needs to be constructed<br>and that most places are not like that<br>at all and then in order to understand<br>the problem of developing countries and<br>in particular the failure of development<br>we need to know more about violence and<br>how countries deal with the problem of<br>violence so here are another<br>illustration I want to give you the<br>essence of the violence trap in another<br>way so through Sidda T's is one of the<br>great theoretical historians from<br>ancient Greece talking about the the war<br>between Sparta and a the Peloponnesian<br>War which led to disaster for for Athens<br>and one of the things the city says and<br>this is adapted from Josh / one of the<br>great students of classical Athens he<br>says lucidity says to survive a<br>community needs walls for protection but<br>walls requirement money how do you get<br>money well there are two basic ways<br>trade or plunder but to do so that is to<br>do either of trader plunder you need<br>ships well to build ships you need to<br>you need to have walls because without<br>without walls you have insufficient<br>protection to do something that takes as<br>long as buildings<br>so here we have a slightly different<br>form of the the catch-22 logic something<br>we'll see again over the course of the<br>talk so they're two basic ideas I want<br>to build on the first is is that<br>violence is endemic as violence in the<br>developing world one of the things we<br>show is that the median developing<br>country experiences violent takeover of<br>the leadership in their country say a<br>coup or a civil war the meeting country<br>experiences at once in every eight years<br>so this is something that's actually<br>quite prevalent in the world it turns<br>out that the for the top 10% of the<br>world which which differs from all<br>arrests the median number of years<br>between violence's on is is on average<br>60 so it's much different than this<br>so the nww that's my radiation for north<br>walls and wine gassed the the our thesis<br>is that every country has to solve the<br>problem of violence and one of the keys<br>to the puzzle is going to turn on in<br>organizations and and the key difference<br>is the way to think about organizations<br>is is can you go form an organization so<br>all of us in the countries we live in<br>can go form corporations for example<br>whether for business purposes or for<br>soccer leagues and we can do that in a<br>relatively easy way we don't have to<br>really go get permission to do that kind<br>of thing in the sense that we need an<br>act of a legislature or the blessing of<br>the right politicians or bribing of the<br>right politicians that's called open<br>access to organizations other countries<br>have limited access to organizations and<br>this is a part and parcel to the nature<br>of limiting the way markets work by<br>making it difficult for people to form<br>organizations that compete the same<br>holds for democracy that is<br>organizations that compete for political<br>power so this is a key aspect this<br>concept of whether you have limited or<br>open access to organizations so here's a<br>the key theoretical insight we argue<br>that states developing countries<br>typically have a distributed<br>access to violence it's not just the<br>state that has access to violence<br>there's lots of other groups in the<br>world in in most developing countries<br>that have access to violence and so the<br>natural state we argue is the natural<br>way to solve these problems we call it<br>the natural state because is because<br>most countries over time in history have<br>formed of this way and most states on<br>the planet today are still of this form<br>and the basic idea is that States create<br>rents that is they they manipulate<br>markets and create privileges for<br>individuals say give them a monopoly on<br>the local beer factory so that in a<br>particular city they get to make all the<br>beer and earn monopoly rents from that<br>and but one of the things that this the<br>reason why countries do this we argue is<br>because the nature of violence if the<br>violence if the rents are targeted to<br>individuals in ways that is proportion<br>to their political power that is their<br>political violence power then you can<br>get people to cooperate by virtue of<br>having the rents as long as the rents<br>are more valuable than fighting and so<br>you can get a degree a piece of this but<br>this has a this has a problem and over<br>time over time a natural states the<br>effect shocks and shocks and so they can<br>go into violence and so that creates a<br>that creates a problem I'll explain a<br>little more about that another important<br>principle though that I want to say and<br>I'll tell you more about this in a<br>minute but I just want to flag it here<br>is the idea of the what we call the<br>proportionality principle this is the<br>idea that more powerful groups that is<br>those with greater violence potential<br>need to have more rents and privileges<br>the reason is that they're more powerful<br>than what they get their expectation of<br>what they'll get if they fight is larger<br>and so in order to make them better off<br>not fighting you need to give them more<br>now what this means of course is that<br>things are very personal in the natural<br>state that is personal in the sense that<br>they that who you are really matters<br>this is very different from the<br>developed world where individuals<br>where we have citizenship and people<br>have impersonal rights they have rights<br>by virtue of being citizens not because<br>they know the powerful guy down the<br>street okay and the violence of trap as<br>is is an important feature of this and<br>I'll speak more about this but one of<br>the things that makes it work is that<br>part of the way in which developed<br>countries solve the problem of violence<br>is the idea that they create economic<br>integration and the value of economic<br>integration politically with respect to<br>violence is that it makes it more costly<br>for a different plate for the different<br>groups to fight so for example in the<br>United States in 1815 the South where<br>slaves are produces the export the<br>export crops cotton sugar tobacco that<br>kind of thing but they don't produce any<br>of the services associated with getting<br>this to market so the markets are<br>typically in Europe and it's the<br>Northeast that provides these they<br>provide the ships the transportation the<br>insurance the marketing the the loans to<br>the farmers during the time they're<br>producing this and so all of that is<br>done and there's an a specialization and<br>an exchange process here over time this<br>becomes much less important to the<br>United to the to the north as a matter<br>of fact as as the economy grows there's<br>so many markets expand so much that the<br>importance of this market for the north<br>goes down tremendously and so the cost<br>of fighting the south in fact go way<br>down I don't want to suggest that's the<br>entire reason for a civil war but it's<br>certainly a factor in the civil war all<br>right so here's I want to proceed as<br>follows<br>I'm gonna give you a little data on<br>endemic violence don't worry we're not<br>looking at statistics here we're gonna<br>talk about elements of the developing<br>country environment environment I'm<br>gonna give you a bit more of theory not<br>much more I've hinted at all the key<br>concepts so far and then we'll actually<br>see the violence trap and how that works<br>and then we'll develop some implications<br>for democracy the rule of law and why<br>okay so here's some evidence on regime<br>duration I said this before the idea had<br>to do with how long does a regime last<br>in power in a particular country between<br>periods of a violent takeover so as long<br>as a regime takes over power through<br>nonviolent means whether elections are<br>not the regime we count is continuing on<br>the other hand if there's a cool that<br>takes over it takes power through<br>military might or then the regime ends<br>and so the question is how long do<br>regimes last and so what we're doing is<br>looking at the 50th percentile here that<br>means we're looking at the median<br>country in the category and there are<br>three categories of interest oops<br>so one category is the poorest half of<br>the distribution then there's the<br>richest 10% of the distribution and then<br>there's the richest developing countries<br>there and notice what the numbers are so<br>this is the number of years so the<br>poorest half of the distribution that is<br>half of all countries in the world<br>experienced a violent takeover once<br>every seven years whereas if we look at<br>the richest the answer sixty so a very<br>big difference and if we look at the<br>richest quartile with the richest decile<br>removed I'm gonna redo this so it's<br>simply the second decile a little easier<br>to understand the idea is there it's<br>12.5 years in other words violence is<br>still really prevalent even in the<br>richest developing countries and<br>therefore they have to worry about<br>taking into in violence into account and<br>the nature of their politics and<br>economics I think I sell this so I want<br>to focus on two features in developing<br>country environment one is the idea of<br>distributed violence potential I've<br>mentioned that already<br>so think about Mexico Mexico is is one<br>of these richest developing countries<br>it's in the second category its Mexico<br>and Brazil are called middle-income<br>countries not literally because they're<br>in the middle of the distribution which<br>they're not they're still on the low end<br>but because<br>people don't want to have simply rich<br>countries dominating at rich countries<br>and poor countries so Mexico one of the<br>riches so think about the way in which<br>violence is distributed there there are<br>the drug lords who manage a major<br>portion of the country and there's no<br>pretense that the government has power<br>and authority in those areas<br>similarly labor unions have the violence<br>potential they have the potential to<br>disrupt the economy to they've taken<br>over States and shut down states where<br>they don't haven't gotten their meat<br>there their demands met there's the<br>Pemex which is the oil company the<br>state-run oil company which for years<br>had its own private army to defend<br>itself and of course there are the<br>America the native peoples in Chiapas<br>that have their own use of violence so<br>right away in one of the richest<br>countries here are four different non<br>non-governmental sets of actors who have<br>access to violence and and will use it<br>in other countries such as Argentina<br>Brazil Thailand South Korea it's the<br>military the military takes over you<br>through coos with some regularity more<br>recently we've had the Arab Spring which<br>new kinds of potential for new hope for<br>these countries that were all<br>authoritarian and of course what we find<br>is ex post two years later we have<br>instead of having promised emerged we<br>have new forms of new forms of violence<br>so in Egypt Libya and Syria they're all<br>either authoritarian or or or or violent<br>another thing that's important is shocks<br>so shocks have to do with the way in<br>which the world changes sometimes they<br>are sudden you can think of a shock as<br>the earthquake in Christchurch for<br>example overnight the economy is<br>devastated there's some that tend to be<br>more slowly like swings and commodity<br>prices or differential growth if you<br>have two different parties that are<br>potential fighters in in in a country<br>that potentially might fight each other<br>one grows more faster than the other<br>then that changes the nature of the<br>relative power<br>and as a form of shock discovery of<br>minerals is another one is another one<br>that often wreaks havoc with the nature<br>of economies examples of the way in<br>which this affects just give you a<br>couple Marco sinned in the Philippines<br>so he took power as a democratically<br>elected leader in the I think late 50s<br>or early 60s I believe and things were<br>going well but toward the end of his<br>second term things are going less well<br>and it's clear that if he may has a<br>third election he won't win and part of<br>the reason has to do with I think people<br>want to move on beyond this and want to<br>move beyond the corruption so he imposes<br>martial law and suspends the nature of<br>elections and this works reasonably well<br>for about a decade but toward the end of<br>the decade commodity prices which are so<br>important for a country like the<br>Philippines they depend on on products<br>of palm trees such as palm oil and sugar<br>and as those prices plummeted his<br>ability to spread rents around in the<br>coalition support ium diminishes and so<br>some of the key players switch sides<br>Marcos is one of them and switch sides<br>meaning that that he no longer is giving<br>them enough to support Marcos and so<br>they switch sides<br>other examples are here Putin Russia the<br>way in which energy prices has changed<br>the constraints on him the same thing<br>Chavez faced the same in Venezuela and<br>Pinochet through taking power in through<br>violence in Chile so the main point<br>though to take home from this is that<br>shocks changed the distribution of<br>violence potential and therefore the<br>nature of distributions of privileges<br>and rents have to be reordered in order<br>to maintain peace and that process is<br>not guaranteed to work well every time<br>so tactics to reduce violence so how did<br>it developing countries that is natural<br>states deal with violence and you know<br>hero reach back to the theory in the<br>book the answer is is we argue as rent<br>creation so as I mentioned somebody may<br>get a local monopoly on beer<br>or the ability to produce cement the<br>local monopoly on a bridge over a river<br>and tolls monopoly on tell if a<br>telephones is another favorite one for<br>developing countries now in order to<br>make these rents work there has to be<br>protection of competition because these<br>are privileges that can be eroded by<br>competition and so in order for these to<br>work privileges have to be backed up by<br>several things first of all limits on<br>act on the ability to form organizations<br>to compete that makes it more difficult<br>for competitors to arise and in some<br>places the privileges themselves require<br>that nobody else can form an<br>organization to do particular tasks so<br>in other words these natural states are<br>inherently limited access orders it's<br>very hard to form organizations if<br>you're not part of the dominant<br>coalition and another is the substantial<br>studies and subsidies and privileges one<br>of my favorite questions when I'm<br>talking to people about India and people<br>who've been to India is ask them do you<br>remember when you flew what time you<br>landed and they say oh yeah we landed at<br>1:00 in the morning I say what do you<br>think that was oh I assumed because<br>traveling around the world you kind of<br>end up there at that time well it turns<br>out that's not the reason at all it<br>turns out that major if foreign air<br>carriers can only land in India legally<br>between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 a 10:00 p.m.<br>and 4:00 a.m. there's one airline<br>however that can land from other places<br>during the rest of the day you have a<br>guess on what that would be<br>Air India yes exactly<br>so this is the nature I don't mean to<br>sit at single India there must be fifty<br>countries that have something very<br>similar and it's it's just amazing how<br>clever people are at creating these kind<br>of rents in developing countries so key<br>insights the key is to that the rents<br>have to make key individuals and groups<br>with violence potential better off<br>cooperating than fighting each player's<br>rents must succeed what they expected if<br>they fight and family to do so means<br>that at least one of the groups is<br>willing to fight and begins to end in<br>this<br>a civil conflict than not and so the<br>distribution of benefits therefore has<br>to me maintain or follow what I call the<br>proportionality principle I mentioned<br>that before the idea is is that groups<br>that are more powerful have to get more<br>rents and the reason is is that their<br>value of fighting to them is higher and<br>so they need to be bought off the cost<br>of buying them off is fire<br>this also means because it's<br>because it's proportional to power it<br>means that individuals get very<br>different things who you are really<br>matters these are very personal places<br>in the sense that powerful gets the<br>powerful get exceptions and privileges<br>the others do not so as I mentioned<br>States these states must limit access<br>they do so to protect rents and<br>privileges they suppress organizations<br>political economic and social they even<br>make it difficult to form social<br>organizations and part of the reason is<br>is that social organizations where they<br>may be initially formed solely for the<br>purpose of creating soccer leagues but<br>they allow people to cooperate and hence<br>potentially threaten the state and so<br>the state is very nervous about<br>organizations that are independent of<br>itself and in fact many natural states<br>are rigged so that every single organ of<br>major organization has some tie to the<br>ruling the the the ruler of the ruling<br>family so this includes mubarak egypt<br>Suharto's indonesia Hussein's Iraq Nazi<br>Germany these are very common where<br>every major organization has to have<br>some close political tie and often they<br>have a member of the family of<br>that's part of their board that is keep<br>a key member of making decisions and we<br>see this again and again in the<br>developing world so here are three<br>lessons lesson one natural states lack<br>in personal rights such as property<br>rights why is that well in personal<br>rights means that individuals have<br>rights by virtue of being who they are<br>of being a citizen for example and and<br>and the problem with that is is it makes<br>it hard to have privileges because<br>privileges require that you single<br>people out privileges are personal they<br>require that individuals with violence<br>potential get more than others and so as<br>a consequence it's very hard to have<br>rights and so that's one of the really<br>key failures of markets economists have<br>long known that the nature of property<br>rights and secured property rights are<br>really important for investment and<br>growth another key concept is perpetuity<br>that is the idea of perpetuity is that<br>institutions live beyond the lives of<br>those who create them so think about the<br>difference between a partnership a<br>traditional partnership and a business<br>and a general incorporation firm so a<br>partnership is personal it matters who<br>the players are and in particular when<br>one of them dies<br>the partnership has to be dissolved now<br>it doesn't have to be all the assets<br>sold it can be sold as an ongoing firm<br>an ongoing organization but each one has<br>to be dealt with individually whereas in<br>a corporation corporations are owned<br>through shares and shares you have<br>property rights to as an individual and<br>when you die your heirs interpret your<br>share interpret inherit your shares and<br>as a consequence the corporation doesn't<br>need to be reorganized and so it's<br>perpetual it lives beyond those who<br>created the same concept applies in<br>politics the question is when a new<br>leader comes to power is there an<br>expectation that the rules will remain<br>the same so when there's a new president<br>of France<br>the new president comes with the<br>expectation of following the rules these<br>are rules not of his or her devising and<br>rules that will live beyond typically<br>his term or her term in office on the<br>other hand in places like Russia Putin<br>comes in it and he changes a great many<br>rules that had come from the Yeltsin era<br>these are not perpetual institutions<br>because they depend upon who is in<br>office and the next dictator is going to<br>change the rules in ways that they find<br>convenient and finally there's the idea<br>of control of violence violence is<br>important to control because natural and<br>natural states as we have seen have<br>lacked this ability and and it's very<br>hard to have impersonal rights or<br>personal light rights if there is<br>widespread access to - to violence in<br>contrast as I say here at the end open<br>access or developed countries have<br>possessed all three of those<br>characteristics they are part of the<br>nature of development so lesson two<br>economists when they look at countries<br>natural states like this they see what<br>they call market intervention here the<br>government is controlling or<br>manipulating markets for political ends<br>and we agree that's what that's what the<br>state does the state and manipulates<br>markets for political ends but we<br>disagree with the nature of how to think<br>about it and why that happens so<br>economists think that the market would<br>be would exist naturally with but for<br>these market interventions and so<br>therefore everybody can be made better<br>off by dismantling them everybody in a<br>classic problem of monopoly if we take<br>away monopolies and create a competitive<br>industry then then the the welfare of<br>citizens goes up that's standard<br>economics one the problem is is that the<br>this this approach obscures the nature<br>of the logic if the logic is rent<br>creation to solve the problem of<br>violence then rents in fact are doing<br>something valuable they're not simply<br>useless transfers or negative some<br>transfers to individuals they're<br>actually serving a purpose of preventing<br>violence and so that means when the<br>economists come along and say we're<br>going to<br>economic reform we're gonna make markets<br>work better and dismantle these monopoly<br>privileges what they're really telling<br>the country is we're going to dismantle<br>the features that make peace in your<br>country and as a consequence they don't<br>want to do it<br>so reform fails again and again and<br>again there are no great success stories<br>in this business lesson 3 rent creation<br>in the absence of markets rent creation<br>as the economists do say with market<br>intervention rent creation does hinder<br>the economy and natural states fail to<br>grow that as they remain poor in part<br>because of this nature of these policies<br>but they're trapped into them it's very<br>hard to get out of this because the<br>whole reason that they have them is not<br>simply greeting people people are<br>greeting in every kind of economy as we<br>know rather it's the nature of the fact<br>that these rents are needed to produce<br>peace<br>so query if a bargain satisfies<br>proportionality principle and we<br>Institute's peace why do we find<br>violence well violence occurs as through<br>these epics Q's me peace can fall apart<br>when there are when they're big enough<br>shocks so I talked about various shocks<br>before what shocks do is they they<br>change the nature of the distribution of<br>violence potential and often they do in<br>ways that are not clear to the<br>participants it's not what we call<br>common knowledge there's to use another<br>art term of art there's asymmetric<br>information and what all those terms<br>mean is I the world has changed in ways<br>that we both know I've gotten more<br>powerful than you have I may think I've<br>gotten more powerful than you think I<br>have and if that difference is big<br>enough then the highest you're willing<br>to pay me that transfer me not to fight<br>can be below the lowest I will take not<br>to fight and so as a consequence we<br>fight and so that's the importance of<br>shocks and that's why violence that's<br>why agreements that fit this set that<br>satisfied the proportionality principle<br>can't live on forever shocks shocks are<br>inevitable and means violence is also<br>inevitable<br>now here's some evidence consistent with<br>this theory so what are we looking for<br>here we're looking for the number of<br>years of peace punctuated by violence so<br>what I have here are the the poor<br>countries we're just dividing countries<br>into the poor half of the distribution<br>and richer half not literally this is<br>this this includes must be about eighty<br>percent eighty and ninety percent of the<br>countries and this is about ten percent<br>and we rule out states that are rich by<br>this measure that are nearly the oil<br>States and so what do we find<br>well we ask how many years do they grow<br>what's the proportion of years in which<br>they grow what's the average growth rate<br>and in years where they contract what's<br>the negative growth rate so take a look<br>at the poorer countries positive years<br>of growth percent is 66 so sixty-six<br>years they grow on average thirty four<br>years they contract when they grow they<br>grow quite a bit and in fact as you can<br>see here when they grow they grow quite<br>a bit more than do the rich countries<br>this is sometimes called the advantage<br>of ketchup but when they contract they<br>also contract more quickly than do the<br>rich countries and moreover they<br>contract in many more years than do the<br>rich countries and so part of the reason<br>we argue for this is that this is<br>evidence of the violence craft this is<br>evidence that there's violence that<br>causes the switch between a set of<br>positive years of growth and a negative<br>set of years of growth so one of the<br>economic integration I mentioned this<br>before having to do with the early<br>United States and the value of economic<br>integration is that it raises the price<br>of fighting so when there's economic<br>integration across lines groups that<br>might fight that that is they're making<br>investments that whose payoff depends<br>upon cooperation then it makes the then<br>it makes them better off because it<br>makes them less likely to fight because<br>puts those investments at risk but the<br>problem is is that at first investments<br>are vulnerable to violence and so<br>there's a tendency not to make these<br>investments in the first place because<br>there's too much risk so that's the<br>nature of the trap let me put this in in<br>other terms terms that are more familiar<br>to the catch-22 logic so there were and<br>forgive me that my prose is not as<br>elegant as Joseph Heller's so there was<br>only one way to escape the violence trap<br>and that's by investing in economic<br>integration so people could stop the<br>violence all they had to do was make the<br>investments in immigration but they'd be<br>crazy to do so the real threat of<br>violence make these investments too<br>risky and it's peaceful rationally do<br>not make the investments but the absence<br>of the investments means violence that<br>in essence is the violence trap it's<br>very hard for poor countries to get out<br>of this and so poor countries persist in<br>this equilibrium that is a much less<br>that is a stable state that is much less<br>I've mentioned this before an implicit<br>theme of the current approach is that<br>developing countries are like developed<br>ones only less so that is they lack<br>something so one of the first theories<br>about what they lacked had to do with<br>capital they I'm as I mentioned that is<br>they lack capital and hence the ability<br>to invest and so if we gave them the<br>capital that would allow them to succeed<br>well that turns out not to work<br>education is another technology<br>democracy rule of law all of those have<br>the same characteristic they've all been<br>tried and<br>aid to developing countries have been<br>tied to these in various ways and they<br>don't produce any more development than<br>any of the others that this is not this<br>is not a way and part of the reason is<br>is these things don't work the same way<br>you may have a system that you call<br>democracy that is of Elections in Iraq<br>for example in the mid arts but it's not<br>a democratic country in the sense that<br>say New Zealand is a democratic country<br>and has been one for four decades New<br>Zealand has perpetual institutions it<br>has impersonal rights you have rights<br>simply by virtue of being a citizen<br>there's no there's much less a problem<br>with violence and so New Zealand as well<br>as other of developing country developed<br>countries are very different in this<br>well consider a country that's trying to<br>create an element to the rule of law<br>so rule of law what is the rule of law<br>about well it's many things but one is<br>its in personality that is it treats<br>people alike citizens have rights by<br>virtue of being citizens not because<br>they're powerful or not because they<br>know someone who's powerful they also<br>have perpetual institutions that is they<br>have institutions that live beyond those<br>who created they live beyond the current<br>ruler they don't depend on the identity<br>of the current ruler and of course<br>there's an absence a distributed<br>violence potential because without that<br>absence people can powerful people can<br>undo either the first two so absence of<br>violence is simply a necessary condition<br>for the rule of law well as we've seen<br>as I've argued already natural states<br>cannot sustain these features that as<br>natural States cannot maintain each of<br>those three characteristics and so it<br>cannot create the rule of law and as a<br>and as a result decisions are not made<br>with respect to justice are not made<br>with respect to principles so one of the<br>interesting things then is that all of<br>developing countries are most developing<br>countries have all the trappings of a<br>justice system they have things that<br>look like courts they have things a look<br>like judges the judges wear robes<br>have chambers they they hear cases they<br>make decisions they cite precedent I<br>mean it all seems to look just like our<br>system except it doesn't work anything<br>like that our system our system it's<br>based typically on in personality what<br>are the rules what are the facts of case<br>how do they fit sometimes you ask the<br>question is the is the the rules the<br>precedents inadequate for this case if<br>so do we need new one the like and so<br>that's very common whereas in developing<br>countries what happens well in order to<br>get in that courtroom something has to<br>happen typically and that has to do with<br>the nature of personality you have to<br>bribe somebody and sometimes the bribe<br>is really easy in the sense that there's<br>a fixed price and you go and you pay<br>that price you get justice meaning you<br>get the decision you want you know pay<br>that price you don't get the decision in<br>other countries in fact it is it's very<br>difficult to know even how to go through<br>them every time you talk to another<br>bureaucrat there's another in in the<br>judicial system there's another<br>constraint and another person to bribe<br>and another thing you need oh well you<br>have the signature of that Minister I<br>see but not this Minister didn't you<br>know you had to get this decision of<br>both ministers and in fact didn't you<br>know you had to get this one before you<br>got that one oh this is really bad what<br>does that mean this is going to cost you<br>more money and so those are much worse<br>systems of justice so they have all the<br>trappings of the rule of all they just<br>are not rule of law the same thing holds<br>for democracy democracy in the world has<br>come increasingly to mean elections do<br>you have free and fair elections Jimmy<br>Carter our former president is a<br>champion of this view and one of the<br>problems with this view is it fails to<br>embed the system in a way that has a<br>chance of surviving so they have<br>elections yes but stable democracies<br>know most new democracies fail and in<br>relatively short order<br>often times through the coos that I've<br>been talking about examples have to do<br>with the recent experience in Egypt in<br>the Arab Spring form the old dictators<br>gotten rid of there's something of an<br>election it's not a very successful<br>state and the army moves in<br>takes over and on the whole it's all<br>gone and the story is repeated again and<br>again again throughout the developed or<br>developing world Kenya is another of my<br>favorite examples in the seeming to<br>create democracy in terms of elections<br>and lots of open access and economic<br>reform and seems to be a poster child<br>for the standard wisdom and then there's<br>an election at the end of a seven oh<br>eight forgive me if it's okay oh nine<br>and it looks like the incumbents are<br>going to lose and the incumbents have<br>lots of advantages by virtue of being<br>incumbents they have access to public<br>lands that are very valuable for example<br>and they decide they're not going to<br>give up power and it all ends at that<br>moment and this is very common in<br>developing countries so what might be<br>done instead well instead of focusing on<br>economic reform in terms of the nature<br>of markets that is the policies that<br>I've suggested an approach that involves<br>as I suggested dismantling the nature of<br>the institutions that provide that<br>provide peace instead of focusing on<br>that focus on issues that raise the<br>investment rate and economic integration<br>Outsiders can help do that by buying<br>this for cents subsidizing those where<br>private actors are unwilling to take a<br>take take a chance on investment because<br>it's risky that can be subsidized by a<br>by outsiders and if they do that then<br>they'll have more of that economic<br>integration and incrementally raise the<br>cost of fighting and in in some areas<br>that will be enough I think to at least<br>trigger some degree of growth and some<br>degree of weakening of the logic of the<br>violence trap I should also say there's<br>no miracles in all this so here's an<br>example Iraq<br>something deeply associated with my<br>country and we can think about the the<br>way in which how important the kind of<br>issue is I've been talking about by the<br>amazing failures of the United States in<br>Iraq that is to have these what now<br>seemed to me fantasies of what might<br>have happened had they actually gone<br>into Iraq and taken over as they did<br>that as things were supposed to work<br>really well and they did not they were<br>in fact to this day as you know are not<br>working very well so one of the things<br>that might have occurred in an earlier<br>it's not something that that would in<br>any way work now but one of the things<br>that might have worked differently is<br>there were three groups in the beginning<br>the two groups of Muslims the Sunni and<br>the Shiites and then the Kurds in the<br>northwest of the country and instead of<br>creating elections which arbitrarily<br>allocates a lot of power to a small<br>group or two coalition of a group<br>against another instead rigging it so<br>that the each of the three groups gets a<br>share of the oil rents but they're their<br>share the amount they get whether they<br>get their share depends upon whether or<br>not they cooperate so those that violate<br>certain kinds of terms and start to be<br>violent in particular ways root lose<br>their their their stream of rents and so<br>that conditions there the the<br>maintenance of peace on receiving rents<br>and conditions of rent receiving rents<br>on maintaining peace and I think that if<br>these kind of mechanisms are thought<br>through then the probability of violence<br>can be made significantly lower in these<br>countries and they can have a much<br>better economic climate so that economic<br>investment takes place more naturally so<br>let me briefly conclude I've said I<br>think you've heard this more than once<br>for me absence of violence is a luxury<br>it's not natural violence is a problem<br>for all developing countries that's why<br>there are natural states natural states<br>address these problems differently than<br>do developed countries rent creation is<br>as a feature not of simple market<br>intervention and greedy people but<br>rather to serve a purpose of producing<br>reducing the likelihood of violence rent<br>creation of this form necessarily<br>hinders economic development and<br>transplanting institutions from what we<br>call open access societies that has<br>developed societies simply doesn't work<br>that is simply taking the institutions<br>that we have such as rule of law or<br>democracy and elections or markets<br>simply doesn't work so I've said this<br>the problem with development it seems to<br>anti-climactic putting it here the<br>problems of development are much harder<br>than to solve an economist thing so let<br>me end there</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
