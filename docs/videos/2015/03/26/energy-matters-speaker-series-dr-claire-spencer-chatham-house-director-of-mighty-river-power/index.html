grateful to the center and<br>indeed the business school for having<br>invited me here to what is in fact my<br>first visit to New Zealand so all these<br>years I've never been here I am here<br>actually to try and get a few different<br>perspectives on the Middle East because<br>as basil said in in presenting me uh we<br>tend to look at these things very much<br>from a eurocentric perspective when we<br>talk about the West uh we think of uh US<br>policy European policy and we don't tend<br>to think of anybody or anything very<br>much else apart from that so I think<br>that correction I've already been here<br>two or 3 days has already been made and<br>I also apologize I did prepare a script<br>because I wasn't quite sure um how well<br>I would do just talking ad lib uh over<br>50 minutes I'm normally involved in<br>policy uh discussions where everybody is<br>so well versed in what's happening we<br>tend to be uh discussing the finer<br>detail you know the detail of names and<br>uh individuals who are involved in these<br>things and I did actually want to<br>capture a few key points so uh I will<br>start with this script and I think it<br>will be available to you afterwards<br>which is also a benefit I think um of<br>having something something written you<br>can go back to but I'll will start by<br>saying that that developments in the<br>Middle East are neither all good nor all<br>bad even as the negatives dominate our<br>news screens whether Syria and Iraq<br>Yemen or<br>Gaza uh religion sectarianism Sunni Shia<br>divides all of these characterize images<br>of the Middle East along with the rise<br>of violent jihadism since the 1980s and<br>I should stress it is the 1980s it<br>particularly came to the fall not last<br>year in the form of al-Qaeda and most<br>dramatically Isis or as other call<br>others call it Isis sorry isil most<br>dramatically since 2014 where it when it<br>took over an area of Iraq roughly the<br>size at the beginning it was Belgium and<br>now it's roughly the size of the United<br>Kingdom now tempting though it is to<br>focus uh the whole of this lecture on<br>Isis I'll examine it in the much broader<br>context of what I will argue are the<br>creaking and uneven changes in a region<br>that can no longer sustain itself on the<br>receive wisdoms and ways of doing<br>business that its current political<br>systems have for too long taken for<br>granted and maybe the subtitle of this<br>and perhaps any lecture on the current<br>state of the Middle East should be the<br>Middle East is an Unholy mess and this<br>is one way of saying that the drivers of<br>the current forms of islamist inspired<br>Jihad jihadism are far from being Pious<br>or even particularly religious except in<br>their own terms<br>much debate continues over how<br>representative in fact any of these<br>movements are of the essential tenets of<br>Islamic thought or how far their<br>ideology should be seen as secondary to<br>their political<br>motivations but it's also the case that<br>they don't exist in<br>isolation um from other religiously<br>motivated forces in the region to cite<br>only the Muslim Brotherhood who I have a<br>helpful little map here uh was in charge<br>of Egypt until<br>2013 and indeed the wahhabi version of<br>Sunni Islam which uh dominates Saudi<br>Arabia and indeed the Shia Islamic<br>theocracy as we think of it uh which<br>dominates uh<br>Iran what I'm interested in focusing on<br>here is what the emergence of jihadist<br>movements tell us about what's happened<br>in the region since the Arab Spring and<br>the Arab Spring you probably all know<br>about kicked off in 2011 and was<br>essentially a movement of led by largely<br>middleclass educated people but with<br>others joining in as it gains momentum<br>to demand<br>democracy<br>um and the impact of the failure of<br>those movements actually to install or<br>set in train democracy in more than a<br>few States and one of the success<br>stories where's my little mirror here is<br>Tunisia and in fact I've just been you<br>see how small Tunisia is but that's<br>where it started and I would argue<br>because of the proximity of Tunisia to<br>Europe in many ways uh and the fact that<br>it's already had a long<br>institutional uh and Democratic or at<br>least uh uh institutional constitutional<br>background it has now three four years<br>on agreed a new Constitution and indeed<br>a new government so there is some<br>stability but in the rest of the region<br>as we've seen I mentioned the Muslim<br>Brotherhood uh in<br>Egypt after two years in government they<br>failed to deliver on any of the goods<br>and indeed they were elected but they<br>seem to be or feel that they'd been<br>elected to rule on behalf of their own<br>people rather than the whole state and<br>what had previously been a military<br>State uh actually kicked back and kicked<br>the Muslim Brotherhood out and has taken<br>over since now I could go around the<br>whole region saying where uprisings have<br>not exactly succeeded but I think I'll<br>spare you<br>um spare you all the all the all the<br>damage but the impact of all these<br>developments on the longer term<br>stability of a region which is currently<br>I would argue in its very early stages<br>of working through its own internal<br>conflicts is of course hard to predict<br>but I'm not amongst those who consider<br>that the Arab Spring turned winter is<br>now completely over not least since it's<br>structural causes have still to be fully<br>addressed and will simmer beneath the<br>surface until they find some resolution<br>and the two key factors here even though<br>the prominence of uh democracy demands<br>and political demands were those that<br>grabbed the headlines it seems to the<br>two key factors that are structural<br>passing unemployment particularly youth<br>unemployment combined with a demographic<br>youth bulge which has of age over the<br>past decade now both of these factors<br>spell social volatility which in large<br>part explains why and who took part in<br>the Arab Spring but it's also uh a<br>factor which is vulnerable to the kind<br>of Simple Solutions offered by ISIS and<br>those of its simplifying ilk Who present<br>ideologies which start by saying Islam<br>is the solution well that may be the<br>case but you have to spell out the<br>details it's also the case that this<br>demographic because the young are<br>traditionally have higher unemployment<br>than those uh older and entrenched if<br>you like largely in public sector<br>jobs the risk is not just radicalization<br>but the younger Generations find<br>themselves captured by criminal networks<br>or the underground economy which in some<br>states and particularly in the most<br>densely populated again the Algeria<br>Morocco feature here as well as well as<br>Egypt Egypt is 85 million uh 85 million<br>and they live just up and down the Nile<br>um Algeria is around 36 to 8 38 Morocco<br>is slightly less 35 million people the<br>criminal networks uh which uh are engag<br>in trafficking where things are<br>prohibited but sometimes this parallel<br>economy uh Rivals official economies by<br>as much as 40 to 50% of official GDP<br>so when we talk about official<br>unemployment rates uh certainly during<br>the crisis in Europe where in Spain for<br>example youth unemployment went as high<br>as<br>57% I was quite amused when uh my<br>partners and colleagues in the Arab<br>world said we've got 25%<br>unemployment but what the reality is uh<br>certainly in the youth it was always<br>higher um is a lot of this is disguised<br>by people being semi- employed and<br>underemployed uh but it's in a carer<br>situation uh with no social services<br>they obviously don't pay taxes but in<br>the kind of exploitative situation which<br>actually and the lack of dignity if you<br>remember the Arab Spring kicked off when<br>a young Trader set far to himself and<br>committed suicide in Tunisia because<br>he'd been slapped uh by a local police<br>woman that sense of indignity is what<br>kickstarted the Arab Spring and unless<br>we address it it's going to come back<br>and haunt<br>us and whatever political Winds of of<br>social change blow across the region it<br>seems to me everyone's Focus now has to<br>be on this generation and how they will<br>shape the Region's future and in the<br>interim it's the older generation that<br>still WS power and has reacted in a<br>number of ways either to accomodate or<br>stem the protest movement Unleashed in<br>2011 but the biggest tendency has been<br>to crack down on it and to repress it<br>and to try and displace political<br>demands down the road<br>now in looking at this it's very<br>difficult to avoid overgeneralizations<br>again I could spend a whole hour going<br>around the region telling you exactly<br>what's going on where but let's start by<br>giving you an old truth about the region<br>and perhaps politics in general is that<br>what states and their Le leaders say in<br>public is not necessarily a reflection<br>of what they're doing in private and in<br>the current Unholy mess this aspect of<br>the region has become even more<br>accentuated so what I what I'll do then<br>is is start with an overview of my own<br>thinking about where the region is<br>heading so we've briefly covered the<br>past here and then try to substantiate<br>some of it in more detail and I'd love<br>to do this in discussion with the<br>questions uh you have I'm also aware<br>that one of the focuses here is on the<br>impacts of what's happening on global<br>energy security which of course is not<br>my area of expertise but on which I can<br>offer some thoughts based on the<br>internal and sub Regional security<br>profiles of the the main oil producers<br>in the Gulf which is this lot you<br>probably know over there am I pointing<br>the right direction look how close Saudi<br>Arabia is to Iran we'll come back to<br>that as we'll be seen again I think one<br>of the uh things that have changed since<br>the Arab Spring is it's no longer<br>possible to ring fence the individual<br>states and societies of the Middle East<br>from the impacts of what's Happening<br>further a field and indeed globally and<br>I know when I started my career there<br>was a whole subsector of uh students of<br>the Arab Israeli peace process the Arab<br>Israeli conflict and actually what went<br>on around them um Israel and pal Israel<br>and Palestine being these tiny little<br>contested bit here um never seem to have<br>any impact now you can't talk about even<br>developments in<br>Morocco uh which is heavily tied into<br>the Gulf and is funded by the gulf in<br>many ways you can't talk about any part<br>of this region without reference to the<br>rest now that is something new<br>it could be a good sign but until things<br>settle down it's not necessarily a good<br>sign because it signifies the<br>interference of other states in the<br>Affairs of other<br>places and the Syrian crisis I think<br>you've probably seen what's been<br>happening in Syria has attracted the<br>direct involvement of all its immediate<br>Regional neighbors as well as further a<br>field China Russia Iran the US and<br>Europe as usual and a whole series of un<br>agencies<br>and as an extension of this another of<br>the distinctly new developments in the<br>Middle East since<br>2011 has been the extent to which<br>external players other than the<br>traditional West meaning as I mentioned<br>before the US and its allies in Europe<br>it used to be the West who decided what<br>happened in the Middle East if you<br>remember the era of pax Americana which<br>the US imposed after having galvanized<br>forces together to kick Saddam Hussein<br>out of Kuwait in<br>19991 that era I think bit the dust with<br>the US invasion us Le Invasion I should<br>say there was an International Coalition<br>which my nation was one um but the the<br>us-led invasion of Iraq I think uh was<br>part of uh the demise of this era uh for<br>to and if we look particularly at Syria<br>it has complicated uh anyone's attempt<br>to resolve things uh we see more than<br>the immediate neighbors all of whom who<br>have ideas about how to resolve Syria<br>whether they're on the side of President<br>Assad remaining in force or whether<br>they're against him and to add to this<br>we now have the direct involvement of<br>states such as Russia uh which has<br>defended uh president Bashar al-assad uh<br>both from its uh position on the UN<br>Security Council when the US and others<br>have tried to uh unify the inter<br>International Community with un backing<br>uh to confront and deal with uh Assad's<br>uh indiscriminate and sometimes<br>targeting of his own civilians it has<br>been Russia uh swiftly accompanied by<br>China which has blocked these<br>initiatives it's been Russia however<br>that when there was talk of a red line<br>having been crossed and the US engaging<br>in air strikes against uh Assad's<br>military forces that it was actually<br>Russia who suggested instead and persuad<br>Assad to give up his chemical weapon<br>stockpile so uh thereby avoiding direct<br>action against them and China in turn<br>China is not notably seen as a key actor<br>in this region except as an investor and<br>has been heavily involved in recent<br>years not directly related to the Arab<br>Spring but in uh major infrastructure<br>projects as a contractor as well as an<br>investor but China too is a member of<br>the UN Security Council permanent and<br>joined Russia in blocking um attempts to<br>restrain Assad on the basis that when<br>the UN Security Council with Russia and<br>China's backing agreed to certain<br>resolutions uh in sequence over Libya<br>this led directly to the Assumption by<br>other parties the British French and<br>Americans that that entitled the outside<br>world to assist directly indirectly in<br>the removal of Mama Gaddafi and for<br>reasons of their own the Chinese and<br>Russians are very averse to the idea of<br>regime change and have blocked any<br>suggestion or any resolution that might<br>lead to that<br>sense now as I've mentioned earlier the<br>Arab Spring did not necessarily cause<br>this shift in geopolitical realities but<br>it certainly an accelerated a growing<br>realization that since as I mentioned<br>earlier the us-led invasion of Iraq the<br>West as traditionally conceived can no<br>longer affect major political or<br>strategic changes in isolation of their<br>own Global interests and factors it's<br>entirely new for example that at least<br>since the end of the Cold War for the US<br>and Europe to be contending with Russia<br>in both the Ukraine and Syria normally<br>when outside powers from Europe and the<br>US have focused on the Middle East<br>they've been able to ignore<br>others too many Al Alternatives now<br>exist for regional actors and individual<br>states to actually resist uh the force<br>of American diplomacy and the idea as<br>we've seen in recent years of a<br>fully-fledged US American Military<br>intervention is now almost definitively<br>although let Never Say Never Off the<br>cards and the demestic factors which<br>have limited the actions of Western<br>powers are also well known in the region<br>and have also been exploited to<br>individual Advantage by re Regional<br>leaderships on a number of occasions<br>even before 2011<br>and the first of these of course is<br>the7 to8 financial crisis which has<br>given the wealthy Gulf States above all<br>a level of Leverage over cash strapped<br>Europe which they didn't exercise quite<br>so boldly to<br>2011 there's also Lively competition<br>you're probably aware of between Western<br>allies to secure arm sales contracts in<br>the gulf and this is also impacted on uh<br>the US's uh margin for maneuver when<br>they too before they moved away from the<br>financial crisis were looking for uh<br>foreign export<br>contracts and a second change arising<br>directly from the Arab Spring is also<br>that the realization that this region is<br>much more diverse internally externally<br>than previous characterizations and<br>generalizations about the Arab world<br>actually used to present I think we're<br>now moving to an era in which when we<br>talk about the Middle East and we<br>already talk about the Middle East and<br>North Africa that we can't make the kind<br>of generaliz ations that we do now about<br>Arabs about Muslims about Middle Eastern<br>Arabs and Muslims because they're all<br>moving in slightly different ways and<br>these for reasons of historical<br>development if you look at the states of<br>North Africa I've already<br>mentioned many of them speak French<br>almost better in fact in Algeria I once<br>said Salam alayum in Arabic to an<br>Algerian Minister who immediately asked<br>me in French Madame do you speak French<br>because he's Arabic<br>my my arabic's bad but his Arabic was<br>worse than mine he only spoke French<br>this is a factor which you won't find uh<br>everywhere across the region but the<br>links into Europe which are often seen<br>and certainly the colonial links with<br>France were often and often depicted as<br>a negative in many ways when it comes to<br>changing and moving on have become a<br>positive because it's a conduits its way<br>into Europe and what is interesting now<br>is there's a whole younger generation<br>who suddenly we realized at the time of<br>the Arab Spring had both within the<br>country but also through travel and<br>study overseas had learned English and<br>as there's a simple reason for this<br>nothing to do with Britain partly to do<br>with the us but English as the language<br>of globalization of interaction<br>particularly on social media and the<br>internet was suddenly an attractive<br>option and as uh one of my colleagues<br>the former director of the British<br>Council in Morocco pointed out to me<br>French even though it was a vehicle for<br>the older generation to engage with<br>Europe it was seen very much as the<br>language of the<br>elites uh whereas the poorer population<br>were always taught in rather bad Arabic<br>which disqualified them from getting any<br>jobs in the French language dominated<br>economy they found a solution to this<br>which is to get rid of both speak<br>English and now under pressure of<br>students and a pressure of economic the<br>needs of economic development now the uh<br>University sector in Morocco amazingly<br>is going to be taught in English they<br>are transforming the whole educational<br>sector precisely because of the need to<br>create<br>jobs and as a result of this because of<br>all the negatives I mean we could talk<br>endlessly about the problems in this<br>region there are many but there is also<br>a small if not yet perfectly formed<br>generation of educated graduates across<br>the region who were not only ready but<br>Keen to move their countries and region<br>into a more constru RVE and equal<br>relationship with the outside world many<br>of these as I say have stud studied<br>abroad even lived abroad despite the<br>difficulties which are increasing of<br>getting visas there are programs of<br>student exchanges between the region and<br>Europe but there is a clamp down because<br>of security reasons more than anything<br>else on allowing students uh into the<br>region but there're also pre-existing<br>strong links with diaspora communities<br>we have a very big Arab diasp Community<br>representing virtually all of them<br>indeed the Kurds when we had a meeting<br>on the uh the Kurdish areas of Iraq<br>suddenly we had 250 of them in a room in<br>chasham house very vocal uh all of whom<br>who live somewhere in North London and<br>orthodontist or something of the O uh<br>but everyone has got some kind of Link<br>outside and this uh when they were in<br>opposition um certainly to what's going<br>on in in in the region uh has been an<br>asset and a point of contact for those<br>who don't feel that things are changing<br>fast enough in the region and I make um<br>this point because the Paradox is these<br>sort of people when it comes to talking<br>about the geopolitical dimensions of the<br>region barely get mentioned it's almost<br>Liv like living in two different worlds<br>when I go to meetings in London talking<br>about the economic development and<br>business startups and incubators and<br>small and medium Enterprises these<br>people are very present they're talked<br>about everything is very Dynamic uh and<br>the usual question is what about funding<br>models what about regulation when you're<br>talking about the security challenges<br>and when you're talking about the<br>overall politics uh it's all about how<br>many of them are hidden radicals<br>islamists terrorists and I think the we<br>need in our own discussions um more of a<br>convergence over not um singling out or<br>demonizing people who frankly if they<br>are blocked and profiled as potential<br>terrorists I'm not saying they will all<br>become them but there is a way this is<br>the path towards marginalizing and<br>isolating people and without going into<br>the recruitment of foreign jihadists I<br>think there's plenty of studies on this<br>and in this context I'm not sure many<br>people know that uh women in Saudi<br>Arabia um set up more startupme<br>companies last year um than their<br>equivalent in Europe or the US now there<br>are social reasons for this that for<br>women<br>uh there are more women graduates in<br>Saudi Arabia than there are men the<br>women funny enough do better at<br>University isn't that funny women very<br>strange women always get better grades<br>at University they do better but uh<br>there's a huge problem of unemployment<br>for social reasons that in Saudi Arabia<br>which is very socially conservative uh<br>women are expected after they graduate<br>to get married go home not work one way<br>they can work is through the internet<br>set up a startup company from home so<br>that they can comp that um and hopefully<br>also through that employ others um in<br>the same way but I think that is<br>something that we don't talk about<br>enough we Again The Stereotype of Saudi<br>women is they're veiled repressed not<br>allowed to drive as one of my Saudi<br>colleagues says I don't need to drive I<br>chauffeur because of this in my policy<br>discussions and I'm not often giving<br>lectures but I'm often in seminars where<br>we're trying to tease what we should do<br>my main message to European and US<br>officials is that we do now need to see<br>considerably more backing than has<br>materialized so far for turning the<br>economies of the Middle East into<br>genuinely vibrant market economies and<br>this is not as is often supposed and I'm<br>often criticized for an invitation to<br>support the worst of the predatory<br>capitalist systems which have passed for<br>private sector uh in many Arab states<br>it's rather an invitation to restructure<br>the West's bilateral relations Europe's<br>in particular on the bilateral relations<br>with individual states in the region on<br>entirely entirely different and more<br>expansive footing otherwise the region<br>will fall back on the kind of crony<br>capitalism that actually provoke much of<br>the original Arab Spring protests and<br>what's needed now especially for Europe<br>which is at risk if not already reaping<br>the worst rewards of neglected societies<br>which in the case of Spain as we can see<br>over there is only 14 km away from<br>Morocco and you may have heard of a<br>number of uh migrants mostly subsaharan<br>actually breaking into the Spanish<br>Enclave of suta Malia the two of them<br>and trying to get into Spain and Europe<br>that way that we have to have a much<br>better sense of co-development and<br>joining forces in addressing what in<br>Spain you may have seen is still a<br>financial crisis uh with very high<br>levels of youth unemployment there must<br>be ways in which uh solutions to the<br>problems on both sides are do done in<br>ways that mutually benefit both<br>sides and the rationale for actually<br>engaging first and foremost on the<br>economic side is the same as it has been<br>here in the US and in Europe namely that<br>without the emergence of genuinely<br>autonomous private sectors fully delink<br>from the personalized networks of power<br>that stymy the full application of the<br>rule of law law and it's also been the<br>case in the uh uh Middle East that most<br>people already work and want to work in<br>the public sector for overinflated<br>Ministries because it provides security<br>of jobs but if you continue down that<br>path you will never really see full<br>democracy since only an active Civic<br>population whose income and well-being<br>does not entirely depend on the state<br>will be able to hold their own political<br>leaders to account in the way that we<br>all aspire to do in our own<br>democracies and despite having some way<br>to go to prepare for these changes the<br>Arab Spring it seems to me has at least<br>opened up the possibilities for a much<br>closer understanding of the economic<br>underpinnings needed to consolidate<br>democracy and for us to engage on that<br>ground alone it's not just a question of<br>creating jobs for the sake of it it has<br>to be a transformational<br>exercise and then a final I think it<br>would may be final it's certainly uh<br>another change I think will endure from<br>the Arab Springs is that it demonstrated<br>the world a great surge of creativity<br>above all in local affiliations and I've<br>already mentioned the links into Europe<br>but there is an amazing creativity<br>across the whole<br>region and one of the myths if you like<br>that has been broken in the process is<br>that the Arab world is in fact uh<br>exclusively or indeed very Arab at all<br>now I've already hinted at the Kurds let<br>me show you where all the Cs Kurds are<br>if I can actually see the Kurds straddle<br>four states uh bits of Iraq bits of<br>Syria bits of<br>Iran and actually they were the Great<br>leftovers if you like of the settlements<br>the Sykes Pico and all after the first<br>world war who did not gain a state they<br>are now living certainly in Northern<br>Iraq in an autonomous region which has<br>escaped the worst of the damage I mean<br>they're now coming under Threat by ISIS<br>Etc but they very cleverly after the<br>demise of Sadam Hussein um signed<br>contracts with the Turks and certainly<br>aril and sumani which are the two main<br>towns have seen something of a mini Gulf<br>boom they even have mini Bal Arab you<br>know mini um towers that they they have<br>built there there is enormous dynamism<br>in this part of the world and they're<br>not Arabs but they are within the Arab<br>world it's also the case going back to<br>this end of the region that at least 50%<br>of Morocco is burned the bers are the<br>indigenous people in Algeria it's<br>25% all these identities are coming much<br>more to the four and are significant in<br>getting away and creating Alternatives<br>as well as different relationships with<br>Europe which a younger generation who<br>did not grow up or even know directly uh<br>French colonial rule or indeed in Jordan<br>where they don't uh have any<br>recollection of uh the British having<br>been in control control they basically<br>have a completely open-minded they are<br>much more pragmatic about where to go<br>next and much of what they have<br>discussed and debated as we know has<br>taken place on the social media and I<br>you've probably heard discussions<br>already about the immediate and<br>important role the social media played<br>in actually kicking off the Arab<br>Spring but the same social media we<br>should be aware now has been revealing a<br>darker side to developments and have<br>been used not just to spread the<br>jihadist ideologies of Isis but have<br>also served the purposes of an<br>anti-democratic backlash against the<br>honeymoon period of free speech which<br>prevailed uh in the two or three years<br>after the Arab<br>Spring and where central governments and<br>here we're talking particularly in the<br>Gulf but also in Egypt sadly where we<br>remember the tar Square activists<br>increasing numbers of bloggers activists<br>journalists have been arrested as most<br>prominently seen in the trials<br>imprisonment and sub quent release thank<br>goodness of the AL jazer journalists in<br>Egypt over the past year and this is<br>certainly a setback um but just as the<br>Arab Spring itself demonstrated that it<br>could Escape official attempts to exert<br>exclusive control over the media so this<br>clamp down I think is only a step in a<br>much longer story of Confrontation and<br>accommodation<br>eventually and my hunch is that most of<br>the Tara Square activists of which there<br>were several million<br>uh have who have not actually left Egypt<br>found themselves arrested have actually<br>gone underground and will reemerge in<br>another guys as a later date some of<br>them obviously have been irrevocably<br>disappointed and some have emigrated but<br>the silence that currently Reigns over<br>what many of them we do or don't know of<br>happening should not be taken as a sign<br>that they're completely out of the game<br>they will reemerge I think they are<br>regrouping and thinking that leadership<br>leaderless vaults was clearly not the<br>way<br>forward and at the uh public and<br>geopolitical level which I'll move on to<br>next which is the relations between the<br>governments of the region things as you<br>probably may have seen have become<br>extremely complex and fraught even where<br>they apparently support the same<br>objectives this is in itself a<br>relatively new sign of a regional<br>diplomatic activism which has taken the<br>place of a long-standing expectation<br>that the US and its allies will<br>determine or direct Regional outcomes as<br>they did uh at the time of the invasion<br>of<br>Iraq and these same Regional leaderships<br>and here we're thinking primarily of the<br>Gulf States who are the wealthiest have<br>long been urged by successive us<br>administrations to assume responsibility<br>for their own neighborhoods but this is<br>not exactly what's emerged not only have<br>a new set of non-state actors not just<br>um the jihadists but others<br>um who have had influence whether it's<br>in the private sector or elsewhere not<br>only have they had more leverage over<br>the direction of events but official<br>responses to events have actually been<br>more defensive and an hoc than<br>leadership so what's happened uh<br>essentially is in the Gulf States they<br>have no interest in democracy or<br>democratization and they feared greatly<br>and they were extremely angry with the<br>US for having support Ed uh the demise<br>of President Mubarak in Egypt who was a<br>strong Ally previously of the Gul States<br>so what has grown up out of this is an<br>unofficial alliance between Saudi Arabia<br>the Arab uh United Arab Emirates Kuwait<br>and Jordan so uh Saudi being the big one<br>and then I think some of them are<br>missing aren't they United Emirates<br>Kuwait Jordan so this lot who were<br>largely Sunni in fact exclusively except<br>for minorities Arab Sunni<br>States they have joined together to<br>oppose the Muslim Brotherhood who who<br>were elected to govern um Egypt in<br>201112 and who were unseated um by a<br>coup the Egyptians who've taken over<br>since don't like the word coup but it<br>was a military coup the c word is banned<br>in Egypt um and they have been they have<br>been arrested many have been sentenced<br>to death they have been repressed but<br>they still represent a about<br>30% uh an estimate of 30% of the voting<br>population so these these uh these<br>states put money into the region they<br>put money into combating the Muslim<br>Brotherhood at the same time as other<br>states such as turkey and Qatar<br>financially supported the Muslim<br>Brotherhood because as we as you<br>probably know the AKP in um in Turkey is<br>itself derived from a Muslim Brotherhood<br>school of islamist thought now these<br>in theory at least are the moderate<br>islamists of the region the ones who<br>actually want to change things from the<br>ground and Through The Ballot Box and<br>not engage in violence and some would<br>say they're on the same Spectrum um<br>others would say the adoption of uh what<br>are seen as more salfy<br>ideologies uh is uh is from a different<br>source of roots and uh it's closer in<br>fact to the wahabi<br>ideology the of Sunni Islam in Saudi<br>Arabia so there are some complexities<br>here given the suspicions that uh there<br>are a number of supporters in Saudi<br>Arabia who were behind um uh Isis and<br>others not officially it's been denied<br>but private funders have actually<br>facilitated the rise of<br>movements and because of this the splits<br>certainly since the Advent of violence<br>in Syria um has increased and it's also<br>accentuated the divisions<br>uh within the region and I think even in<br>just recent weeks we're seeing uh the<br>possibility of the Saudis having<br>completely vilified the Muslim<br>Brotherhood actually adopting a rather<br>more uh moderated line towards<br>them and in turn in addition to the<br>battles going on within Sunni Islam the<br>key winner if you like over the last few<br>years has been Iran who uh the Iranian<br>uh regime since 2011 has actually ring<br>Saudi Arabia in many ways through<br>proxies rather than um directly uh<br>getting involved um<br>militarily and these uh the Saudis are<br>particularly shocked and is now taking a<br>position of being very opposed to uh the<br>Iranian influence given that they accuse<br>Iran of allegedly having provoked the<br>2011 sheer uprisings in the tiny Island<br>state of Bahrain which was one of the<br>first Arabs spring uprisings that was<br>contained and put down Bahrain even<br>though it's very small has a majority<br>Shia Muslim population with a Sunni<br>ruling family so that they hung on and<br>with the support of the Saudis were able<br>to see off the Shia<br>uprisings Iran also supports uh hisbah<br>in<br>Lebanon uh and has been notably<br>alongside with the Russians and in the<br>distant background the Chinese alongside<br>supporting president president Assad<br>against any attempt to unse him and this<br>is because Assad or the Assad family and<br>the Assad regime come from the alawite<br>minority uh in Syria uh which is a<br>variation of Shia Islam against a<br>majority which is largely um Sunni which<br>interestingly is the opposite if we want<br>to go on to Iraq of um Iraq where 20% of<br>the population are Sunni and the<br>majority at least of the Arab population<br>are sheers and part of the battle<br>against the Isis and the the way Isis<br>has galvanized support is that it<br>accuses the Shia majority government uh<br>under al- Maliki the Pres prime minister<br>al- Maliki who was elected during the<br>time the US was still um uh certainly in<br>control of Iraq has adopted more of a<br>sectarian proia Islam agenda at the<br>expense of the Sunni population and I<br>would say rather than comp ating matters<br>more I think I'll move on to the energy<br>um conclusions next I would say that<br>sectarianism is something we should be<br>wary of seeing as being entrenched in<br>the region it is manipulated<br>operationalized it is true that people<br>have these identities but rather like<br>the Catholic Protestant divide in<br>Christianity is not something which is<br>operationalized in normal societies and<br>yet became absolutely critical in<br>Northern Ireland it is the context in<br>which these conflict s arise and the way<br>that injustices are embedded in<br>sectarian terms and that people's<br>grievances are um Unleashed against the<br>other which is critical here and it's<br>usually to my mind the failure of the<br>states of the region to integrate all<br>its citizens at least on as equal a<br>basis as possible under the rule of law<br>now most of these states are yet fully<br>run by the rule of law but historically<br>the reason sectarian violence hasn't<br>been a norm in the region is that people<br>have been able to accommodate and<br>mediate their differences and I think<br>what we're seeing increasingly uh in the<br>Middle East is that those that mediation<br>is not taking place and in fact those<br>who might engage in it like for example<br>the wealthy Gulf States are actually<br>exacerbating it by themselves paying for<br>proxies to counter the proxies that they<br>see are being funded and used by um Iran<br>on behalf of for the sheers they are<br>actually supporting those who would<br>oppose um the<br>Iranians now how much time have I got I<br>think I should actually say something<br>equation<br>um<br>sorry yes the energy equation falling<br>oil prices is the critical thing here<br>and it's been estimated um that the gulf<br>cooperation Council states which is the<br>alliance of the major it's not OPEC but<br>it's uh roughly consonant with some of<br>the major Gulf oil exporters that their<br>budgetary shortfall will be to the tune<br>of $300 billion this year because the<br>oil price has gradually tumbled from its<br>Starry Heights of<br>150 um US dollars a barrel to around 60<br>and in fact below that it's hovering<br>around 60 at the moment now the smaller<br>States you should see a difference<br>between the larger populations of um Sai<br>Arabia uh which has 28 just under 29<br>million people um obviously in a larger<br>land mass and the smaller states such as<br>Qatar who are extremely wealthy and only<br>have an indigenous population of<br>278,000 but expatriate workers 1.5<br>million so there's this tiny minority on<br>top so when I saw the figure of their<br>GDP per capita was<br>$100,000 um I imagine that applies to<br>the indigenous population not those<br>expatriate workers uh paid very little<br>to uh construct the stadiums for the<br>World Cup in<br>2020 but Saudi Arabia has for a long<br>time uh and certainly their major<br>reaction to main reaction to the Arab<br>stream was to throw money at it and this<br>is with reserves of<br>$730 billion do from the Heyday of high<br>oil prices um they've been able to<br>afford it but they also have uh annual<br>budgets of 229 billion which I would say<br>is roughly a third of their reserves but<br>let that's without counting their<br>income uh but they're often regularly uh<br>exceeded and while a lot of money has<br>gone into their way of dealing with uh<br>potential internal descent and these<br>unemployed women graduates among other<br>things uh was to increase the wages of<br>uh public servants public officials and<br>their pension pot and even with the<br>change of King this policy is continuing<br>as the new king after King Abdullah uh<br>died in January his half brother King<br>Salomon has just announced yet another<br>uh pension pot and salary<br>increase and while a lot of money has<br>been spent on infrastructure in<br>increasing um INF transport<br>infrastructure hotels even building or<br>trying to diversify the economy into<br>petrochemical plants these are not the<br>sort of areas of the economy that will<br>attract uh domestic Saudi labor because<br>they don't work in factories they are<br>used to living off um generous set of uh<br>public handouts this will probably only<br>increase uh the levels of expatriate<br>workers and so the stresses when they<br>come are likely as I've already<br>mentioned Saudi is facing a number<br>number of regional stresses uh<br>particularly um the most recent one<br>being the Takeover by some minority Sher<br>hoti tribesmen of Yemen now Yemen<br>actually had managed peacefully to get<br>rid of its president in 201 move him<br>aside they had a long and lengthly<br>National dialogue process a new<br>president was appointed and then the<br>hotis who are uh have been claiming<br>autonomy in the north of the country<br>actually have stormed in and taken over<br>and it is thought or at least Accused by<br>the Saudis they've done this with<br>Iranian funding so the Saudis and you<br>can't see Yemen it's fallen off the map<br>but it's underneath the yellow it's<br>underneath the yellow state so the the<br>Saudis are feeling very vulnerable and<br>may actually also have to spend money uh<br>on a military Venture they have actually<br>deployed troops down to the borders of<br>Yemen in the past but actually to unseat<br>the hooes Yemen is a is a heavily and<br>densely populated state may be quite a<br>tall order it's also the case that the<br>Saudis have along with others in the<br>Gulf have been subsidizing um the new uh<br>government since the Muslim Brotherhood<br>were removed in Egypt to the tune of 20<br>billion uh dollars a year which you know<br>in the overall scheme of things may not<br>be that much they're not paying all of<br>that the qit is are contributing as is<br>the UAE but this is also something which<br>can't be sustainable over the longer<br>term so I think there may be some<br>vulnerabilities um to the Saudis they<br>currently have very low debt so they<br>could actually borrow to cover the<br>excesses but there's a lot of debate and<br>perhaps we could debate this those of<br>you who are energy Specialists here as<br>to why the Saudis have not actually<br>restricted their exports and output in<br>order to try and control Supply it was<br>thought at first they were doing keeping<br>the price artificially low to see off<br>competition from us Shale uh oil but I<br>think uh the US sector has shown some<br>resilience in this respect smaller<br>operators with high operating costs<br>obviously are heavily leveraged and find<br>it difficult to continue but I don't<br>think it's a way of seeing the end of<br>the um the the Shale oil uh Revolution<br>there's another theory that they were<br>doing it to punish the Russians um you<br>know the Russians are in some difficulty<br>economically they have a heavy<br>dependence on oil and gas exports and<br>the Russians having been seen to be on<br>the wrong side on the Syria equation<br>might be punished uh but I suspect the<br>real reason is is another one put<br>forward which is if the Saudis restrict<br>their supplies to the market others will<br>fill um they will others will fill their<br>place because the market is actually<br>over supplied relative to demand which<br>is you know another reason for oil<br>another aspect and I think I'll finish<br>on this is um in the energy equation<br>certainly is what if Iran comes back on<br>track Iran as you probably know is under<br>some extensive uh us and international<br>sanctions although uh in terms of its<br>own um oil exports it's I think got the<br>Fifth's largest reserves in the world<br>and obviously has not been able to<br>export as much um as it has in in the<br>past but present one of the the limiting<br>factors is the nuclear program<br>negotiations being led by What's called<br>the P 5 +1 it's the permanent five<br>members of the UN Security Council plus<br>Germany uh which have an interim I mean<br>they had an original deadline which was<br>passed in November last year but as you<br>probably seen with the the speech the<br>very prominent speech of President<br>Netanyahu of Israel in Congress saying<br>anything but a deal with Iran there is<br>in fact some progress has been made I<br>mean the details we could we could go<br>through but which involve uh Iran<br>exporting some of its uh low-enriched<br>uranium stock piles to Russia and<br>various safeguards and monitoring it<br>will accept the um um Extended protocol<br>of the iaea which is the inspection<br>agency in Vienna and there are a number<br>of ways in which we could finally see<br>this question resolved to everyone's<br>satisfaction in which case um Iranian<br>oil could in itself um actually damage<br>the long-term oil price um for States<br>like Saudi Arabia now whether in fact<br>any of this is going to burst at the<br>seams uh in ways that affect energy<br>security remains to be seen I mean the<br>biggest risk it seems to me is for some<br>kind of next layer of tension to<br>escalate between Saudi Arabia and Iran<br>but I I think Saudi Arabia is still in a<br>position where it expects others to not<br>only fight its battles for it even<br>though it's acquired quite a<br>considerable stockpile of its own in<br>terms of military weaponry in recent<br>years um but would actually back off<br>from U confronting Iran which is<br>extremely um able tactically and<br>strategically uh to cause quite a lot of<br>damage particularly in the stets of huz<br>which is the major uh um Gateway if you<br>like for oil exports out of the Gulf<br>area so I think I'll leave it there I'd<br>rather hear from you about what you<br>would like to know more about</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
