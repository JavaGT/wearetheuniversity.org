Teachers learn how to use evidence from their schools to design more effective teaching programmes and drive change within their schools, which will have major benefits for their students and future students. Last year four teachers were selected for the scholarship and, in this video, they provide an insight into their research.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I applied for the wolffish early teacher<br>master scholarship because I saw it as<br>an opportunity to be able to do research<br>in my own school my research is about<br>finding out what parents think about<br>that IEP process in the school IEP as an<br>individual education plan where we work<br>really closely with our parents around<br>different student needs to help them to<br>succeed you're working with families and<br>their realities listening and valuing<br>our parents voices is really important<br>and we need to take that time to do that<br>and sometimes in the school we don't<br>have that time Sharon's research will<br>benefit the school because it's going to<br>build better quality relationships<br>between the school and families between<br>families and the teachers and build a<br>sense of belonging a sense of ownership<br>and ultimately to build on those<br>learning focus relationships that we<br>were always aiming for for the<br>betterment of the children and for them<br>my research focused on how the school<br>could try and increase the involvement<br>from parents and terms of actually<br>helping with the children's academic<br>food and recreational reading we thought<br>we could intervene to develop the<br>reading habits of children bringing<br>those two things together<br>and trying to work with the parents and<br>have the parents help to increase the<br>amount of reading that was done at home<br>what we've found is that it's a really<br>important tween trying to engage parents<br>to make sure that you take into account<br>the specific circumstances of their<br>family and off their child so rather<br>than trying to get a strategy which you<br>get everybody to do in the same way you<br>actually work collaboratively and find a<br>reason the civic intervention that's<br>going to be of benefit to their<br>individual family my research was<br>prompted by her perception among English<br>teachers in our school that our year 13<br>Pacifica girls we're not eating as well<br>and in say level 3 as we'd expected<br>based on the level 2 data we have some<br>outstanding level 2 in English students<br>and we didn't feel as if we were getting<br>the results variability Warrenton in<br>level 3 so we wanted to try and find out<br>from the girl's perspective why that was<br>we had lots of theories but the students<br>were the best ones to explain those<br>theories for us another important<br>finding was that it was huge diversity<br>among the six Pacific students who were<br>included in the research those suggests<br>they're coming up with stereotypical<br>explanations for Pacific achievement<br>isn't a reasonable course of action<br>my research is about teaching strategies<br>that effectively promote the achievement<br>of Pacifica students in NCEA level to<br>English and I wanted to look at that in<br>my school because as in many New Zealand<br>schools there's a gap between the<br>achievement of Pacifica students and the<br>rest of the cohort and I hope to be able<br>to narrow that gap through the findings<br>of my research we have a significant<br>number of Pacifica students on our<br>school role and English is a really<br>important subject at level two so if we<br>can introduce more effective teaching<br>strategies into the level two English<br>we'll be able to raise their achievement<br>overall and meet government targets that<br>have been set for NCAA level two in the<br>future</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
