We use it for tourism and recreation, and it is a large part of our cultural identity. It is also vital to the primary sector. Everything we do has an effect on water quality, and everyone has an opinion on water and which sector might be causing the problems. Is it humans? Is it cows or sheep? What can be done to ensure a sustainable New Zealand – economically and environmentally? And do we actually have a problem? Come along to this Winter Lecture to hear experts explore the varying ideas and research involved in the ongoing discussion of New Zealand’s water quality.<br><br>Hosted by Professor of Environmental Planning Iain White, panellists included Green MP Catherine Delahunty, Māori and indigenous legal issues expert Associate Professor Linda Te Aho, agricultural commentator Professor Jacqueline Rowarth and economist Dr Dan Marsh. <br><br>To view other lecture in this series, please visit: http://bit.ly/10VuBQA</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be

and gentlemen<br>my name is Neil Quigley I'm the Vice<br>Chancellor of the University of Waikato<br>it's my pleasure to welcome you to this<br>second lecture of the winter lecture<br>series in the winter lecture series we<br>take the opportunity to invite the<br>community to share in some knowledge and<br>some thoughts about topical issues that<br>are of interest to contemporary society<br>I think the number of you who've come<br>along this evening is testimony to the<br>success of this lecture series we thank<br>all of you for being here this evening<br>and for supporting the University of<br>Waikato s winter lecture series<br>tonight's discussion we're looking at<br>water quality we have a panel of experts<br>covering a wide spectrum of views on<br>this topic and it's my pleasure to<br>introduce tonight's host the University<br>of work holders professor of<br>environmental planning Professor Ian<br>White will you please welcome professor<br>sanuk 02 katoa and thank you neil and<br>thank you everybody for coming today<br>while the winter lecture service does<br>have its appeals and the drawback is<br>inherent in the title it's in winter so<br>thanks for braving the cold and coming<br>out tonight this winter let you see this<br>is about water it's about water and the<br>Waikato it's about the values we place<br>on it the pressures replace upon it the<br>benefits it brings and also some<br>insights into what the future might hold<br>the title a discussion is do we need to<br>worry about water and the short answer<br>is of course we do without it without<br>access to it everyday we wouldn't<br>survive without it we wouldn't have<br>economic growth who won't have jobs when<br>of employment and the standards are<br>living we all enjoy wouldn't be as high<br>we wouldn't have access to recreational<br>just to just that sense of being close<br>to water which makes you just feel a<br>better person which or for sin it's<br>quite hard to quantify so the real<br>questions aren't should we worry about<br>our water it's too I extent and why and<br>on what grounds and that's where the<br>scientific community and other<br>stakeholders come together to try and<br>debate these issues and this is<br>particularly important for us in the<br>waikato because we're on a global scale<br>we're incredibly fortunate to live in<br>this place we're in a water-rich part of<br>the world one that's for the parts of<br>the world on and we have a lot of<br>stories in the press about what the<br>future might bring from water metering<br>to water allocation water pricing water<br>scarcity or drought and water quality so<br>the clues in the question is that it<br>means a lot to a different people and<br>it's the words that we upon it that<br>really show how much it means to<br>everybody so we call it resource we call<br>it an asset or something to be allocated<br>but on the other hand it goes beyond<br>this economic growth argument is<br>something intrinsic it's a Tonga<br>and it's something that has real<br>cultural resonance in this country so<br>this is the kind of circle way after<br>square today we've got sometimes<br>incredibly precious but we've got a lot<br>of people who want access to it and I<br>think we also take it for granted in<br>comparison to previous generations we'd<br>sit on the top and it's just that and<br>that gives us a makes us feel a little<br>bit more removed from where it is and<br>what it means I think maybe in the<br>future just as in the past they might be<br>incredibly surprised that we use<br>drinking quality water to flush away our<br>waste a few generations ago that would<br>just be incredible and maybe in the<br>future when it's more scarce than we<br>might look at it differently again so we<br>also walked down the river paths and<br>we're gaze upon it and we just enjoy<br>being Narian but there's a lot of work<br>that goes behind the scenes to make that<br>water accessible for everybody to make<br>sure that it's something we can all<br>enjoy so it's both for public good and a<br>private asset and that's the problem<br>it's good it falls from the sky we think<br>we all own it it's everybody's on no one<br>owns it it's the same kind of question<br>so as this feel of a basic human right<br>but we also need to pay for the<br>infrastructure that moves it to where we<br>want it to go and we also need to<br>recognize that it does bring huge<br>economic benefits to this region and<br>this region particular needs agriculture<br>needs tourism and other industries so to<br>help us appreciate the subject to mow<br>deaf we've assembled a cast of experts<br>who can provide a rounded and balanced<br>discussion of these topics and water as<br>such valued it's been called the oil of<br>the 21st century in the same way that<br>oil cause many of the conflicts of the<br>20th so the 21st Walter is going to be a<br>key issue so while i'm hoping the punter<br>will help us debate disagree and discuss<br>the issues i don't think the body count<br>will be as high as you in the most of<br>the 20th century so before we gather I'd<br>like to introduce the panel on my left<br>is<br>professor Jacqueline growlithe she's a<br>professor of agribusiness in the waikato<br>management's girl she's a frequent<br>contributor to public debate an<br>agriculture and agribusiness and in 2008<br>was named a companion of the new zealand<br>order of merit for a services for<br>agricultural science her research<br>careers largely focus on nutrient<br>management and she's dedicated to<br>promoting awareness of science and the<br>importance of research to skills<br>interest groups and society in general<br>next to Calvin is associate professor<br>Linda tell her she's a lecturer in the<br>university's tapering go there faculty<br>of law where she researchers and<br>teachers Marty and indigenous legal<br>issues Linda says has lead negotiator<br>for an RC car key kuru court I hope I I<br>stopped ok so I've been really worried<br>about some of these I'm not been in the<br>country at that long so this is this is<br>a big thing treaty claims and provides<br>specialist advice on the Treaty of<br>Waitangi claims and post-settlement<br>government issues to Erie and Harper<br>organizations and technical advice on<br>Marvin legal issues in relation to land<br>and freshwater Erie leaders crown<br>agencies and government departments next<br>to lindo we have chris lewis chris is<br>the president the White Castle branch of<br>federated farmers and the national vice<br>dairy chair he's been with federated<br>farmers for more than nine years serving<br>previously as vice dairy chair and dairy<br>chair because it's been a farmer for<br>more than 22 years and milks 1100 cows<br>on his pookie thira after Wednesday our<br>dairy farm is wife and two children next<br>is caffeine Delahunty the Green Party<br>spokesman for water quality and rights<br>she's worked for more than 20 years on<br>wastewater and toxics issues including<br>campaigning for the cleaner for the<br>Tarawera river and it's currently<br>campaigning to protect walter ways from<br>dairy pollution she's a committed to<br>tility activist and believes we have an<br>obligation to the Treaty of Waitangi to<br>protect Walton support mana fires kind<br>aki aki support the local people's<br>spiritual gardens of guardians of water<br>Calvin's also the green spokesperson for<br>women's rights education human rights<br>and security or what angle and on the<br>end is dr. dan Marsh the waikato<br>management skills chair of economics and<br>any environmental economists with the<br>universe's Environmental Research<br>Institute in recent years done is<br>specialized in economics of water<br>quality and it's worked for the Waikato<br>Regional Council the Department of<br>Conservation fishing game and many other<br>stakeholders who advocate for better<br>policies to protect water quality in New<br>Zealand so that's the panel and the<br>format is is that we've got a series of<br>questions where we try and get to go to<br>some of the main issues which we think<br>might we think about water how do we<br>evaluate how much of a problem is it<br>what a water quality issues what our<br>water quantity issues a metering and<br>also Maori cultural issues and what does<br>the future hold we'll also try and find<br>time at the end to feel questions from<br>the audience so hopefully we'll have<br>timely answer here what is anything in<br>particular you want to ask and who you<br>might want to dress it to but first I<br>think we need to get to grips of just<br>the nature of the problem so the sorts<br>of days what do we need to worry about<br>water and that might be varied views on<br>a pan onto I extent that's the case so<br>the first question to the panel is what<br>do we need to worry about with regard to<br>our boards it is it a problem how much<br>and why per house Jacqueline just<br>because you're close listen no other<br>reason you might want to start with that<br>question Thank You Ian add or go back to<br>what you actually put down on the paper<br>did I change you most need to worry<br>about okay to guard water quality and<br>for me in educator<br>it's absolutely ongoing statements that<br>were going to help in a in a canoe<br>possibly about water quality when the<br>comparisons with overseas are fantastic<br>we are in the top quality for water in<br>most not all but most of our and<br>nutrient concentrations eek a lot any of<br>those things I will quote a Hamilton<br>City Council and say you can drink the<br>Waikato from taupe or two tuakau I'm<br>British too sorry but I practice so<br>don't drink it at Merriweather a<br>lot of black swans you might want to<br>avoid just downstream of any cities<br>because of dogs but apart from that you<br>can drink it down to the sea and where<br>do I hear some of the press reports it<br>pins not to be presented like that and<br>what worries me most is an<br>educationalist is these sorts of<br>statements when we know that farmers<br>have foot I'll quote federated farmers<br>and say a billion dollars into making<br>sure on farm they're capturing nutrients<br>and keeping our eco light if there but<br>music is pretty good in terms of cows<br>and e.coli keeping it on a farm and<br>doing the right effluent sup what's gets<br>out to the schools is that dirty<br>dairying Agriculture's terrible and we<br>don't get the bright kids coming through<br>an agricultural science agribusiness<br>whatever we have some we have a<br>tremendous group at the University of<br>Waikato with particularly recruiting in<br>this area so that we have great people<br>going out but what I hear in the schools<br>is they don't want to get involved in<br>agriculture and these bright kids are<br>the ones that will be able to make an<br>even better difference in the future in<br>education we reward good behavior and<br>the farmers have done a lot and we can<br>see it in some of the water trends I<br>like encouraging good behaviour I was up<br>to slightly worried we wouldn't fill our<br>time but I think now I think if I was<br>going<br>plans to know we may have to cancel it<br>so maybe Linda do you want to respond<br>initially well I don't think what we<br>need to do is not so much worried<br>because searching and worrying is doing<br>nothing and if we do nothing things are<br>going to get worse and I'm not so<br>concerned about what's happening in<br>countries who have polluted the rivers<br>for more than 500 years more than we<br>have we need to worry about what's<br>happening in our own backyard and what's<br>happening in our own backyard of it some<br>of our waterways and our lakes and<br>rivers and particularly small streams<br>and tributaries are actually dying so<br>much Solomon was on TV just the other<br>day tomato who have just completed a<br>major study and of the waterways in<br>terms of fresh water quality and here is<br>that many of the waterways on the<br>tipping point of being dead bodies of<br>water so there is a lot to be concerned<br>about but what we need to do is take<br>action and in my view and it will come<br>through the various answers to the<br>questions and caught it or tonight is<br>that here we have been leaders in terms<br>of identifying and prioritizing and<br>restoration and protection of the health<br>and well-being of waterways and so we've<br>actually we're going to be getting on<br>two issues as instead of allocation and<br>marty rights and interests and those<br>important issues but when we have the<br>choice of what we would prioritize we've<br>prioritized and in the way console<br>particularly the restoration and<br>protection of the health and well-being<br>of the way cuddle weather for future<br>generations hmm ok Chris you next do we<br>have a problem yes we do agriculture is<br>part of the problem we accept that we<br>have known about this for a long time<br>but we're also part of the solution and<br>we've been working on this for last five<br>years and you'll notice what Jacqueline<br>was mentioned before and the Waikato our<br>farmers have spent well over three<br>hundred and fifty million dollars on<br>trying to find solutions to this problem<br>and online farm personally have a three<br>hundred thousand dollars so we're vexing<br>that these is a problem we're working<br>towards issues and we're trying to make<br>it better for future generations so also<br>we have when you have any human activity<br>as in Hamilton Cambridge or on the lane<br>there's going to be an environmental<br>outcome so not just the farming as par<br>the problem it's the towns and cities so<br>all collectively I've got to do our part<br>to get a great outcome so so we're<br>involved with CSG and so we're going<br>with a clever way of finding solutions<br>for this problem and it's in the answers<br>lie in this community if we all pitch<br>unlock we didn't tap oh and rotorua you<br>get good outcomes working together so i<br>encourage it more as Chris caffein we<br>keep it song it's a federal y con tu<br>time to eat you know on a photo just<br>like to acknowledge the people of this<br>place and the Waikato River you people<br>come from our central to this discussion<br>is there a problem hell yeah and the<br>problem is our belief system which we<br>are still trying to change that there's<br>such a place as a way because we have<br>treated our rivers like drains and we<br>have treated them and we have not costs<br>of the real externality cost of what<br>we've done to our rivers so we've got a<br>lot of whip to do and the wicker started<br>I would agree with the previous speakers<br>the workers started but sixty-two<br>percent of monitored brothers according<br>to the lower research cannot be sworn<br>I'm 61 years old and my more corner<br>unlike me cannot swim in sixty-two<br>percent of monitored rivers and our tier<br>war that is a loss to our nation that we<br>need to take very very seriously and so<br>overseas comparisons are not going to<br>help us what we need to face up to is<br>that statistic two hundred and ten<br>minutes being spent trying to clean up<br>the White Castle meanwhile at the top of<br>the catchment land port want to put<br>43,000 dairy cows by 2020 if you don't<br>turn off the tap the white couple river<br>and all the good work downstream<br>not be improved so these are the issues<br>we have to face and we can face them but<br>Dena not going to help but it's not a<br>river in Egypt it's thank you yeah I<br>actually agree with the previous<br>speakers so it's true that our water<br>quality is very good by international<br>standards it's also true that it's been<br>getting worse and that there are many<br>areas where we're really not happy with<br>the way it is I teach environmental<br>economics and an excellent text that I<br>that I used to teach from starts by<br>saying what an environmental problem is<br>it says environmental problems are<br>people problems they occur when some<br>people are unhappy with other people's<br>use of the environment well that's not a<br>good in New Zealand my colleagues at<br>university of lincoln have been running<br>a environmental perception survey for<br>many years and they know that the number<br>one environmental concern of New<br>Zealanders is actually water quality so<br>we have an environmental problems<br>because the people of New Zealand say we<br>have a problem they are concerned<br>they're not happy with with current<br>trends and so certainly major efforts<br>have been made and we need to continue<br>making those efforts yes because if we<br>don't water quality will continue to get<br>worse so what how do we understand<br>quality though because that's some of<br>the things we've touched on today's is<br>it something about turbidity or nutrient<br>load or is it swimmable drinkable<br>vegetable how do we communicate what we<br>want and what we value is Society so how<br>do we get this across about how how do<br>people individuals when what do they<br>want and what can they expect from the<br>scientific community all right I'll<br>answer will be to go go back to the<br>people and indeed that's what you know<br>the<br>process which has been started ourselves<br>that you consult with that the people to<br>discover what is important to that in<br>terms of those different values of<br>turbidity nitrogen quality of the<br>ecosystem native fish and so forth that<br>that's the only place that you can you<br>know it's a people problem we have to<br>address the problem that the people face<br>so is that people problem company or the<br>you know the one is closest to politics<br>is closest to the they are lecturer well<br>certainly is a people problem when the<br>government says the national policy<br>statement on fresh water management that<br>all we had to aspire to as way double<br>rumors so that's their standard so<br>whatever the reason is doing the only<br>goal that they have set for fresh water<br>in this country is waivable so you can<br>give up them they're up to you up to<br>your thighs but don't put your head<br>under now to me that is more important<br>for people to understand that to have<br>the individualization of commodification<br>of water so we can have endless debates<br>about macro and by the fruits and the<br>state of nutrients and how much<br>phosphorus and all the rest of it but<br>for people in this country I think what<br>they want to know is can they get in the<br>river and swim in it can they gathered<br>under can they be safe in the river can<br>they celebrate it with the adversative<br>and their gifts and can they get use it<br>without polluting it so we actually need<br>to talk with people in a much more<br>direct way about the standard is rob why<br>it was not good enough oh yeah you need<br>swimmable and we need our Chi gathering<br>standards and it's been it's been talked<br>about right across the country we just<br>have to change the people on Carla to<br>understand that that's what museum<br>others one I'm just trying to picture<br>what would be worth away table okay and<br>what what's the backward step from Wade<br>well how would we would Walter week are<br>wait for me yeah well what is way to<br>pull all this exactly that I'll show you<br>some rivers that I wouldn't waiter you<br>go down to the totally retro the pilgrim<br>of 150,000 tons of Polaroid going down<br>the total bitter and if you wait in it<br>and you and you soak the soak up those<br>fumes you'll get a headache because we<br>did it and I've been trying to clean up<br>that River for 20 years and the<br>government refused to do it it has a<br>provision on the RMA that allows them to<br>pollute the emergency but how does this<br>weather because Dan telling me that's a<br>number one concern of people and your<br>some of that people wanted but the<br>90-second they wouldn't my bill to clean<br>up one river because it might quote<br>unquote affect business now modern<br>businesses never build their businesses<br>based on pollution they don't do that<br>but the historic pollution that's<br>continuing in this country through<br>certain point source discharge and<br>through things like the mayor court<br>conversions are undermining the modern<br>business approach so government needs to<br>get real how are you tell them I tried<br>okay Lenny internet again and saying it<br>from a mighty perspective the Erie<br>leaders group have just finished two<br>rounds of consultation throughout the<br>motto from Kaitaia to Invercargill and I<br>can confirm that that's exactly the<br>position of what Marty want they don't<br>want way table where sumac cedar and his<br>interview the other week you know when a<br>child is down by the river about to play<br>the note stop and think well now can I<br>wait in this river can I swim in it if I<br>get some of my mouth am I going to keep<br>they just want to jump in and enjoy and<br>enjoy the river and it's quite simple<br>really and but also the timeless species<br>either<br>decatur of the health and well-being<br>from our perspective we not choose bust<br>on some species but 429 whitebait are<br>very important to many Marty so if that<br>present in the river then that's an<br>indicator of health and well-being and<br>what Marty is saying is that we need to<br>be involved in the decision-making<br>processes so that what's important to us<br>can be reflected in these bottom lines<br>that are coming out so is it if it's not<br>a political problem of our politics<br>isn't really engaging with this or my or<br>my reviews how do we do is it do we turn<br>to economics and pricing or I think it<br>is a political problem that's happening<br>there I mean you know we we've had a<br>Resource Management Act for many years<br>and in many ways there was a<br>groundbreaking piece of research and<br>regional councils are required to make<br>sure that the environment is properly<br>managed sustainably manage than the for<br>example water quality does not<br>deteriorate but for many years where did<br>not manage to do that I I do see some<br>encouraging signs in the last few years<br>of more effort to try and take that<br>seriously and some regional councils<br>moving towards rules that that might<br>eventually achieve that and we've had<br>the other national policy state upon<br>fresh water and soap so these are all<br>good science but the effort has to<br>continue in and probably increase in<br>order to and what and and and as for how<br>much yet that we put in well I would say<br>that is a political issue it's about<br>what people want and how the politicians<br>are persuaded to act actually but then<br>economics has always been close to the<br>related politics so but there's also<br>lots like mirrors I mean for example<br>visa in terms of your original world run<br>water<br>allowed to have what they call over than<br>under policy which means that so long as<br>the regional area the standards are over<br>what's required it can be under<br>somewhere else so kill that River over<br>there as long as that one looks good now<br>I think that's not only a treaty breach<br>I'd also think that's an amendment to<br>anyone that lives with rivers and lives<br>with water quality so we've got we've<br>got the policy settings wrong at the<br>moment and much as I respect the vision<br>of collaboration if the Land and Water<br>Forum are collaborating succeed with<br>each other but didn't implement the sum<br>of what a ton of offender had told them<br>to then what is the collaboration with<br>and if the collaboration means that<br>we're continuing to talk while water<br>quality aesthetic or non improving then<br>we're actually just negotiating our own<br>human interests without acknowledging<br>what's actually having to water so so I<br>do think it's political problem and I do<br>think that it should be an electrician<br>or whatever I was just a quick check the<br>other people are people concerned about<br>water today you know do they think it<br>yeah a few knots if you have proper Kiwi<br>I've been told I need to swim in winter<br>to be a proper Kiwi Sara so if we're<br>moving maybe let's let us talk about<br>politics a little bit further because<br>this seems to me that it is an<br>environmental concern but it's not<br>necessarily when it gets comes up<br>against economic concerns it doesn't<br>necessarily get the credence so I mean<br>business and agribusiness these are key<br>issues for the yeah first wet so it was<br>the problem you can you actually talked<br>about business there which is an<br>economic problem because you're talking<br>about a point source and point sources<br>should be the easiest things you clean<br>up just cut them off so what's the<br>business and the economic side of things<br>because they are doing a lot with the<br>nonpoint sources the diffuse sources<br>well then course not but now there's why<br>I keep a straw<br>like the fuse nitrogen is the biggest<br>problem than the catchment so if you're<br>going to not to turn the tap off upon it<br>on the volcanic plateau and allow all<br>those you're a mess the leech into the<br>river well there's not much point to all<br>these guys trying to fence and plant<br>yeah they're water waves because this<br>guy's doing great work downstream and<br>many farming communities have really<br>grappled with that but if you if you<br>continue to have agricultural<br>intensification based on the idea that<br>more cows is better it's a really crude<br>another successful model and look at the<br>dairy price we can't rely on on that<br>approach we need value-added<br>agricultural diversity in agriculture<br>and we need to make sure that we work<br>within the means of the actual physical<br>environment that we end and that's not<br>happening at the upper catchment the<br>lakes went pink color fuan think I went<br>to the meeting I went on a tour of the<br>hydraulics with an eel fisherman every<br>single hydro make in your region change<br>color because of lv this summer<br>something's not okay should we remove<br>the damn thing well that's your decision<br>not like the answer clean is what I'm<br>concerned about so how do we value<br>Walter differently if this is coming<br>down to perhaps a value of water do we<br>some of the debates we've had in the<br>waikato around water metering for<br>example and as a way it's a priceless of<br>proven economic measure to control<br>demand so is that going to be a way<br>forward always up just as it rub up<br>against our view of its a public good<br>I'm going to start with you now down as<br>the economist I'm assuming where you<br>might say well it might be completely<br>wrong so should we if we want to protect<br>something precious should we have<br>economic controls on an odd demands or<br>meters well first of all you need to<br>know whether you've got a short is<br>everything because there are some things<br>which are so plentiful that even when<br>you provide them free you still got<br>plenty and I think probably in the early<br>you know the early moment<br>there was probably the case with water<br>there weren't very many people there was<br>a huge amounts of water and if people<br>used it for free and they're still want<br>the problem you know if you haven't got<br>scarcity as in shortage you don't need<br>the price but the question comes if when<br>if you may then look at the amount of<br>water that people want to use when it is<br>free and there's not enough or the<br>amount they using it's harming the<br>environment then what you're going to do<br>about it it's at that point that I would<br>argue that putting a price on it can<br>often have a useful function and<br>interestingly I know that that's also<br>the policy of the Green Party sewed up<br>so so so and I mean you also ask the<br>Christopher that the question about are<br>about metering and I I hear what to me<br>is a lot of very sort of muddled<br>thinking that quite often the statement<br>is water is the basic need and therefore<br>it should be free well the few liters a<br>day that you need to drink in order to<br>survive that is a basic need but the<br>water that you use in the shower to<br>flush a toilet two nautical garden to<br>clean your car that that's not a basic<br>mean at all and that basic need argument<br>doesn't wash secondly everywhere<br>the limiter and housing and health all<br>that basic needs to but actually we<br>don't provide them free I can give you<br>canvas examples actually where people<br>saying that something should be provided<br>free results in very poor quality<br>provision which often usually harms the<br>poor more than the rich so I'll just 11<br>more points about the very sort of water<br>metering thing assuming you have got a<br>shortage of water and you want to sort<br>of you want people to use it carefully<br>and take account of its value I don't<br>really understand why people have a<br>problem with water meters we don't need<br>to have a problem with electricity<br>meters they don't find many people<br>saying electricity's a basic need and we<br>should be provided it free and we<br>shouldn't have electricity meters we<br>should just be paid us to pay a standard<br>amount and use much as we want all year<br>I've never heard that argument there's<br>really not much difference between water<br>and electricity so the meter is a fair<br>way of sharing the stuff and Catherine<br>do you wanna tell us about the Green<br>Party position is this before then<br>lesson one no and what are the key<br>things you didn't mention was we're<br>closed the privatization of the water we<br>think water should be a public or<br>diminished by public agencies and so<br>that's a big thing around in terms of<br>the assets we recognize the importance<br>of water being managed for the good of<br>all and that might mean charging in some<br>places but i'm not sure that we've got a<br>water shortage now I think we've abused<br>water so much that it's become short but<br>those of us who live in the country with<br>a tank actually know how to manage order<br>and in fact we can teach people how to<br>manage water conservation of water the<br>valuing of how precious of this and<br>that's why you know that the the<br>cultural dimensions of water are really<br>really important the spiritual<br>dimensions of water because they help us<br>value and recognize our essential<br>relationships so I only saying sometimes<br>you might consider measuring but the<br>most important thing<br>but I was in Auckland when they said we<br>were running out of water and then for<br>about a month or so they have these big<br>advertising campaigns before we were<br>lucky enough to get the whiteness of<br>river these are the horseplay Vulcan<br>which sort of us in what at the time was<br>it a lot of toxic discharges going to<br>river time so we didn't want it that<br>people save water amazingly people are<br>capable of incredible discipline around<br>water but they have to value it as a<br>precious resource that's why country<br>people do you know me usefully but for<br>urban people they just used to having<br>unlimited supply and so they don't see<br>it as a precious resource and there's<br>one thing coming down the track one big<br>trainers for climate change and so we<br>are going to be living with climate<br>extremes that include major drugs even<br>in the wife at all we've expense them<br>and already so we are all going had to<br>learn to be conservationists around<br>water and if we go to put a price on<br>water either I'm okay with commercial<br>charging of water and think Commission<br>there should be a commercial charge of<br>water at 44 hours of poor citizens I<br>think if we've got a mentor and I take<br>your argument I think we also have to<br>recognize too that alongside climate<br>change and water are issues we have<br>increasing an autonomy and so we have to<br>recognize some people are struggling to<br>feed their families so struggling to pay<br>for water would just be another burden<br>we had to think about that when we make<br>any political decision just for a wider<br>context we use in New Zealand about 350<br>litres of water per person per day in<br>the UK is about 150 so less than a half<br>so you think about the scope for now<br>trying to get down to 130 litres a day<br>so almost a third so then you're<br>thinking about there's a lot we could do<br>just on behavioral change or<br>technological change without actually<br>appearing to be too much of a sacrifice<br>just domestic yeah Linda you wanted to<br>come in I did I wanted to<br>that I agree that what we need to do is<br>change our mindset around water we don't<br>value water we don't treat it as a toner<br>we collectively some do but generally we<br>don't and in order to change that<br>mindset sometimes we have to get into<br>the habit of doing things differently so<br>so pricing could be a way of changing<br>people's behavior people are already<br>paying for water you know I loved us on<br>the east coast where they have you know<br>drier summers than we do and we've heard<br>here in the South way console and to a<br>CO and in that particular area where<br>when I have had to buy and water tankers<br>because their water is now either dried<br>up because of you know climate change<br>and ongoing drought drought up the<br>drought season after season but also the<br>pollution coming from market gardeners<br>and Phuket go ahead so people model I<br>are now actually having to pay for water<br>and they do really think quite carefully<br>about you know how how they wash that<br>you know what they're going to use that<br>valuable water for in terms of<br>commercial paying commercial payments I<br>agree and I'm not too sure whether the<br>Erie leaders group have got a formal<br>position on that but I do know that we<br>at White Castle university hosted a<br>symposium in November last year and<br>conduction with white castle time to me<br>up at hopparoo and one of the<br>propositions put poster ed jury that<br>symposium was that polluters ought to<br>pay so people who have gotten away with<br>using water and selling it overseas<br>through other products haven't actually<br>paid for the privilege of doing that and<br>the environmental impacts of their use<br>of that water have you know left us with<br>a legacy of 50 years or more cleaner and<br>so I do think that we need to think<br>seriously about that but what we have to<br>do in terms of thinking serious about<br>that I don't wanna be too self-promoting<br>of the University provides I'm not going<br>to stop you from all of the different<br>textures and the different expertise<br>that we have faced at the at the<br>University you know as the perfect kind<br>of place where this we're thinking and<br>research could come from to provide some<br>some positive pathways for what well<br>said okay Chris done LS first moved out<br>two Sluggers I'm a dairy farmer we pay<br>the Regional Council a privilege for<br>getting a resource kits consent to get<br>water where the ground as metered so<br>there's no such thing as free water on a<br>dairy farm make it very clear we pay a<br>grand sum to the Regional Council we got<br>to pay for it to be pumped to the ground<br>there people to be pumped to the cash<br>eat then pumped around the farm we pay a<br>lot of times and then we what a lost we<br>put we pay again because it's not being<br>efficient so that's why we have water<br>meters so in fact I hear this time and<br>time again farming all we want is one<br>rule for all the farmers have got to<br>treat water respect so that people in<br>town we all have to we all have a<br>consent which allows us to take so much<br>laundry up for a business and it's at<br>otherwise visual Council will find it<br>about it so it's not a fear in town that<br>you can only measure so I think by using<br>make water meters you cannot you cannot<br>tell you know you're losing it to be not<br>measuring it I think it how you can put<br>a price on up if you're not measuring it<br>so in the farming world we've accepted<br>that we have water meters with me it's<br>getting measured and we use that fear<br>location wisely and we can get no more<br>so I encourage the people in the cities<br>here and the town's so treat it with<br>respect that we have to in the country<br>and it just means it's a cost and I know<br>a lot of people like ourselves dairy<br>farmers right now we've got no money<br>it's do you want town are struggling to<br>and I don't want to be seen to be<br>putting more burden on the right players<br>than they are but in the day we all go<br>pay up this year for a resource<br>Jacqueline did you want to add 2 i'm<br>british it when i go back and see my<br>and I don't think they wash enough it's<br>on a bit concerned about going down to<br>130 yes I that's what they say about the<br>friend she best way to save water on<br>farm don't let your wife do the wash<br>down we're so particular let the blokes<br>do it and the milks still okay but<br>effectively in terms of water we're<br>extremely lucky in New Zealand yes we<br>have vast amounts that's flowing around<br>most of it just goes out to sea and the<br>first come first serve water allocation<br>system that we have is completely Luffy<br>again we've got people looking at that<br>at the University of Waikato but hearing<br>about three billion liters being<br>consented in Hawke's Bay to be pumped<br>out of the aquifers and sold in Ethel's<br>to China just been well that's probably<br>good will turn to water allocation so<br>this by eight yeah we restore it in me<br>in the waikato times the Auckland Walter<br>Kerr are trying to get another two<br>hundred thousand litres of water a day<br>from the Waikato something which is<br>actually the streets strategic advantage<br>to us and maybe it's a resource for us<br>to use within this region to grow and<br>develop so how do we think about water<br>allocation what the you've done a lot of<br>work on this Linda do you want to start<br>there absolutely um so what are we the<br>Erie position on allocation is that it<br>must be an allocation for a wee in terms<br>of an equitable outcome from the current<br>discussions with the crown so the<br>Supreme Court the Waitangi tribunal have<br>all agreed that Marty have rights and<br>interests that haven't been adequately<br>recognized and needs to be as a matter<br>of urgency as a matter of priority and<br>so I mean senior ministers are meeting<br>with every leaders regularly and talking<br>about allocation and what they've done<br>just most recently as the funded for<br>King work streams and one of one of<br>those kiwi extremes is what does an<br>allocation for a wee look like what will<br>it cost one of the costs and benefits<br>for it and some of the research that<br>now has shown that if money rights and<br>interests are adequately recognized<br>there's actually not just good for Marty<br>but good for New Zealand does it provide<br>certainty around water rights for all<br>and it also provides some equity because<br>we've been excluded from accessing water<br>for a number for decades 150 years and<br>so what bets meant is that some of our<br>lands that we're now getting back<br>through treaty settlements we don't have<br>access to water because of the first and<br>food allocation method so that doesn't<br>do much for our economy it's vulnerable<br>being you know so dependent on a couple<br>of industries doesn't leave room for<br>diversity or new entrants and it's also<br>an equitable because it's been explode<br>it's been excluded excluded Marty from<br>bringing our lens into the economy it's<br>also been an equitable in terms of<br>access to our cultural harvesting areas<br>so we haven't been able to live our<br>takana and keep our language pertaining<br>to those together alive so so that's<br>part of the bigger pictures though<br>allocation for us is not just economic<br>but it's also cultural and it's a really<br>pressing issue that needs to be<br>addressed because I don't think we're<br>going to be able to walk with the<br>pathway forward and tall these issues<br>are addressed so is there is a review<br>from that there is such about other cage<br>because these are and these are quite<br>critical issues for you because you need<br>the water and you've got the right to<br>use it and yeah you is this the kind of<br>conversation you're worried about are<br>happy to engage in or what does what<br>does allocation mean to the sector look<br>at an upward on the white cat eye every<br>day on set go past out to the sea so<br>that's just about fear allocation of it<br>and you know it's plenty they're just<br>being allocated feeling I see that with<br>the theory says there's a good<br>opportunity to get durable and<br>sustainable solutions not only<br>environmentally but also socially<br>economically so it's about fear location<br>and so yeah it longs the in the day we<br>all want jobs we all want a strong<br>economy we want or nice houses but we<br>need balance of an environment and<br>that's the issue we have<br>is here we have a good environment a<br>good economy because if we don't hit<br>either none of us will be here and I've<br>got the other way and say without you<br>put an environment you have no real<br>economy it's a month but he usually<br>crumbles in a disastrous way so you know<br>we can have fear water allocation I<br>agree with what the panel said<br>particularly learned rotatable the<br>article to proprietorial rights that<br>have been clearly established at law for<br>ton of Athena way and have always been<br>there so to me that helps to clarify the<br>debate but one of the problems we've got<br>as the prime minister see that no one<br>owns water meanwhile a random first-come<br>first-served a random soul of water<br>bottles to China irrigations being<br>subsidized by the crown without any<br>acknowledgement of our main users and I<br>think one of the problems of my both of<br>you I think used to expression of the<br>war they watched the water running down<br>after the sea like that's a bad thing<br>actually from an ecological point of<br>view that's what we needed to do and<br>that's how it sustains itself and what<br>we need is to protect the throes of the<br>rivers not just see them as oh my god<br>others like junkies dinner oh it's all<br>just rushing out to sea like that was<br>some kind of problem I mean really<br>that's quite bizarre and it's quite old<br>and they're going to allocate we have to<br>recognize the allocation of the other<br>beings the rights of other beings to<br>have water as well as farmers as well as<br>industrial as as well as humans all of<br>those things need to be thought about so<br>we need a catchment based approach water<br>allocation that looks at everybody who's<br>involved so everybody who has a<br>relationship I'm more interested in<br>relationships than I am with that the<br>issue of of ownership and a sense i<br>think that subpoena we've been forced to<br>talk ownership because of the<br>to acknowledge their relationship so I<br>think that's the critical issue so we<br>really need to say who are all the<br>people involved in this I'm not talking<br>about next month's Thanawala pyriform<br>corroboration model blah blah i'm<br>talking about us and our own communities<br>actually engaging and saying everyone<br>has an insurance not just the people who<br>are making money out of us and now<br>certainly have to be included but they<br>are not the only people who who value<br>water so we actually have to have a<br>different system and occasion but we<br>can't have the prime minister pretending<br>that no one owns water meanwhile<br>allowing the free market to pollute it<br>so you know that's the challenge I'm<br>sure that everyone agrees that we should<br>have a fair eradication but if we had<br>long enough we probably discovered that<br>there's at least 50 different views as<br>to what that fair allocation might be<br>because different people have different<br>views on what fair means so in reality<br>you're going to have to have some sort<br>of collaborative process to decide on<br>some of those priorities based on<br>fairness principles but I suggest that<br>actually pricing can also be useful it<br>should be part of the mix because that<br>can lead to a kind of fairness something<br>to give to give an example if water is<br>is free then and you've got a resource<br>consents to do flood irrigation you've<br>really got no no particular incentive to<br>do better but if you actually have to<br>pay for your water perhaps you'll put in<br>precision irrigation which will be much<br>more much more efficient use of the<br>water and incidentally would also be<br>better for the environment so I think<br>you know we need a mix of using market<br>and also looking at some sort of<br>socially desert of crisis that's<br>probably a good time now to turn I<br>attend to the final question the evening<br>which is just about the future it's<br>about what the future pressures might be<br>what the and we see we how does so in<br>the waikato times today that we're going<br>to get an extra forty percent population<br>in the waikato in the next 50 years<br>you've got Auckland growing an enormous<br>rain and the water resources a starter<br>there's no major investment an<br>investment costing an awful amount of<br>money so if we can go around the pilot<br>thing about what are the major crashes<br>and what do they think the next 10 20<br>years were like will we<br>of these problems so Jacqueline should<br>we start with you what you think the<br>future holds and is it all going to be<br>rosy in one of war two decades yeah<br>we're looking ahead Maggie can go<br>farther if you if you prefer I'm not an<br>economist okay I the science type person<br>I think we will have sorted out the<br>point source of sources the City<br>Council's their regional towns we will<br>have sorted out the industry that is<br>allowed at the moment to put effluent or<br>waste into the rivers and that should be<br>actually perfectly simple to do it's an<br>economic or a business decision and it<br>will help the rivers I think we will<br>also see some of the nutrients that are<br>working their way through the system<br>will get into the water but they will<br>rush out to sea and my point about<br>rushing out to sea is without any use at<br>all and you might say that looking at it<br>is a use or swimming on it or voting on<br>it is a use but nevertheless there are<br>people who need water and might look at<br>ours and think they'll come and take it<br>and I'm talking about from overseas but<br>overall the farmers I believe are doing<br>a tremendous job in capturing their<br>nutrients and using them on the land and<br>they are making sure that they're not<br>escaping all the new technologies and I<br>agree with you about the wire key<br>conversions but some of the new<br>technologies are going in to ensure that<br>we don't exacerbate any problem that we<br>have and overall we can drink the<br>waikato accepted the amaru down<br>definite to the sea okay Linda well ten<br>years this isn't long enough to look<br>forward you know when we were working<br>through the Waikato River Settlement we<br>use the sign of King toffee oh when he<br>was looking into the few are looking<br>back at the river and we use that as our<br>visionary statement for the future that<br>we would see a river teeming with life<br>you know and a river that our future<br>generations could enjoy but the reality<br>is is that<br>these new technologies going and now a<br>lot of the damage has already been done<br>and so we're not actually going to see<br>any of the benefits of the restoration<br>work that we're doing now for another 50<br>years so what that means to me is that<br>we actually have to ramp up the<br>restoration work we have to do more<br>rather than just say oh it's going to<br>get better because we've got new<br>technologies that's not good enough we<br>have to do more and we have to do more<br>now if we really do want to have our<br>mokopuna being able to use and enjoy the<br>ribbons because you know if not in<br>enough then a whole culture dies and a<br>whole vocabulary dies and that's not<br>acceptable as far as I'm concerned Chris<br>look and the what can I work at the CSG<br>process farmers are involved Annette we<br>support the collaborative approach to<br>finding solutions to iographer in<br>solutions they're going to be durable<br>for the x 10 to 50 years I'm not looking<br>at opinions i'm looking for a<br>science-based approach the finding<br>solutions and you looked at what<br>happened and lake rotorua when the<br>community the farmers the priority we<br>all got together delivered issues they<br>sit at the year time frame they achieved<br>it than 10 years the outcomes for the<br>environment so if we all work together<br>we'll get great outcomes and I encourage<br>that yeah I agree with that others about<br>the top remnants that too short are<br>things are going to change quite fast<br>and I believe that humans can change<br>fast if they have to and I think we're<br>going to have to value water war and we<br>will with a climate change but you know<br>let's not get too romantic about what's<br>happening because make toefl even our<br>wonderful municipal environment list an<br>expert well they might have interesting<br>dialogue said that the reason why toefl<br>is included has improved is because they<br>cut the numbers of animals on the land<br>so it's the technology of respect and<br>the technology of a different type of<br>economy is the only is the vision that<br>we hold of the greens we do not want the<br>growth model as it's currently defined<br>because it's relying on more and more<br>and<br>and more animals more and more and more<br>need to control things at the wrong end<br>what we literally what we actually want<br>is that actually have work on an economy<br>where we actually add value to<br>everything that we do and so less can be<br>more and our relationships were valuing<br>soils bearing water and growing climate<br>has to change drastically if we actually<br>go to see real progress otherwise in 10<br>or 20 years time if we keep on if you<br>keep on biting the governor we're just<br>going ahead what was that the TPPA<br>rallies now we're going to add more more<br>power and control of our resources i<br>bring and actually there is the last<br>thing that's going to deliver<br>sustainability little ones to the wall<br>rivers so let's get over waiting around<br>on everyone and get real about valuing<br>the precious resource which is our our<br>okay damn well I'm a bit of an optimist<br>me too provided that yeah that the<br>people really make their views felt and<br>the politicians take action and we come<br>up implement the right policies it's<br>going to take time you know it's good<br>because there's a big slug we're on a<br>downward trend now we'll need you met a<br>major a pity to bottom out<br>Durant but as we do that what I think is<br>really important is that we carefully<br>select firstly the targets to aim for<br>and one we sort of that select those<br>targets we need to take full account of<br>all the costs and all the benefits what<br>I'm saying all the costs and benefits<br>people tend to think oh I'm an economist<br>I'm only interested in the market works<br>but I'm an environmental economist and<br>we actually care about all of the costs<br>all the benefits including the<br>externalities that's what I mean but<br>what's what's really important and I<br>think is sometimes not appreciated is<br>the huge differences that there can be<br>between the different approaches we can<br>take for example um I did some work with<br>a colleague Randall looking at different<br>policies that we which we can follow to<br>reduce nitrogen leaching confirming we<br>were looking at some cutting reducing<br>can numbers banning nitrogen fertilizer<br>land retirement cap-and-trade scheme and<br>so forth the difference between the<br>cheapest if one which was like fifty<br>dollars which was a cap-and-trade scheme<br>and land retirement that was four<br>hundred dollars eight times it is very<br>very common to find that different<br>policies were looking at for the same<br>outcome can have a vastly different<br>level of cost effectiveness there are<br>many you know which might cost ten times<br>as much for the same benefit so we<br>really have to have a good process to<br>make sure we get the best policies okay<br>thanks and we've probably got time for<br>one question from the audience f is<br>quick and if our panel up quickly<br>general of a I saw your hand up earlier<br>but it was to his med debate so I<br>very well if you want to you want to<br>comment about separate I could talk<br>about it yeah before we clear the room<br>man just water like we are so primitive<br>you know I had a tube towards always in<br>towards human waste is unbelievable so I<br>completely agree with you and what's<br>more my partners and scientists he's<br>doing some research on what's in human<br>waste and we've got a class of chemicals<br>now a new breed of complex chemicals<br>emerging in our human waste which means<br>when he's working with palmer 1500<br>entire 30 they're trying to get it out<br>of the with work for 20 years to get it<br>out of the sea and put it on land and<br>get out of the white cotton river all of<br>those things but you've got to<br>acknowledge that human waste is not what<br>it was when with wind hung with the<br>fennel were just went into the forest<br>and had their place for human waste it's<br>now a toxic substance not only the<br>medicines hormones look don't get me<br>started on how bad as a select one of<br>the better we using to clean the toilet<br>is as bad as heavy metals so yeah talk<br>to me later okay that was probably a<br>good point if anyone's to talk to<br>Catherine layer and form an orderly<br>queue but I'm I like to invite professor<br>quickly plant to the stage now to give<br>Thank You EMM can I thank all of the<br>panelists for very engaging and<br>interesting discussion Jaclyn when the<br>press
