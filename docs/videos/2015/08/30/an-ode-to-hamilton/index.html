Wellington I get up<br>every morning thinking that I should<br>have left Wellington years ago and that<br>Hamilton is actually a great place to<br>live but I've been<br>intrigued<br>yeah I've been intrigued by some<br>interesting uh ways in which people in<br>Hamilton Express their interest in<br>living here for example one of the great<br>ones I've struck many times when you ask<br>people why it's good to live in Hamilton<br>they say well it's close to too and to<br>and Raglin and I think oh that's an<br>interesting way to uh to express what's<br>good about<br>Hamilton uh so um ladies and

another textured<br>excitement that we can offer you this<br>evening at the University we've got a<br>series of questions that our panelists<br>are going to answer um obviously your uh<br>involvement and heckling is absolutely<br>fine and welcome uh as we go along<br>because this is a community event and<br>you are that Community who've come out<br>this evening from your homes it's<br>dangerous Cho us to come out into the<br>world so uh it it doesn't matter where<br>you live Hamilton anywhere right so good<br>on you for getting out and getting in<br>amongst it this evening our first<br>question that I will pose to our our<br>panel this evening is um the hidden gems<br>of Hamilton I'm sure if you think about<br>hidden gems yourselves you think about a<br>place or a couple of places that you<br>find yourself selfishly loving and<br>hoping no one else finds out<br>about and yes I'm thinking myself of the<br>Contemporary Garden the American<br>contemporary Garden at the Hamilton<br>Gardens I love being able to go there<br>when there's no one else there and sit<br>in the sou Wester chairs and imagine<br>that's my<br>house and then somebody arrives cuz it's<br>Hamilton G and everyone goes there and<br>they've usually got a child and it's<br>like and you just want to show the child<br>how to swim Facebook first<br>and it's not necessarily appropriate but<br>those little hidden gems of Hamilton<br>that bring out the love and bring out<br>the love marks for all of us I'm going<br>to throw this over first of all I think<br>to the<br>X-Men a lot of years in Hamilton in the<br>underground oh a lot of yes and above<br>ground some of them too<br>um um let me see gems hidden gems so<br>there's just so many I mean I'm a I'm a<br>sucker for rivers and lakes and large<br>bodies of water and just keeping the<br>negative irons up you know um Hamilton's<br>really good for that and there's so many<br>spots along the river um in in the rose<br>gardens you know um I got married in the<br>rose gardens so it's a pretty special<br>spot there for me um but<br>there's it's enough of that unable help<br>people just come to the party just like<br>that just like oh adorable probably not<br>the only one though anyone else get<br>married in the rose gardens here yeah<br>see see cuz that's good right did you<br>get married to each<br>other hi<br>Annie um no excuse me there's um you<br>just so many beautiful spots and and<br>like I said I'm just a a suck of large<br>bodies of water so there's so many<br>gorgeous little spots by the river I<br>can't tell you where they are because<br>then won't be a hidden gym anymore true<br>true I've got several quite often I have<br>to keep them moving along cuz people<br>come along but I mean we've got kind of<br>a time share going on a couple little<br>bits and it's just a just a little<br>grassy out look with a with a River<br>Vista really and yeah grassy you could<br>say but um yeah for me the the the<br>hidden gems and the treasures and the<br>place where I sort of Balan myself uh<br>anywhere by the river really and only a<br>couple of places by the<br>lake well we're lucky the river we do<br>have Sensational Spaces by water though<br>which for a landlock city you know is<br>incredible the access we have to our our<br>beautiful River exactly and obviously<br>with so many buffins in the audience I<br>know about the the effect of large<br>bodies of water on the um the polarity<br>of the air and the the negative irons<br>that abound in places like that and<br>they're really really good for you it's<br>calming and the enemy of that the<br>opposite of that is um large buildings<br>lots of air conditioning lots of<br>computer screens that the ear gets<br>positively charged Oakland Oakland yeah<br>yeah I wasn't going to say I wasn't<br>going to be the first one to say that<br>you know I'm kind of glad that I go<br>Jesse so should we should we hand it<br>over to the next Beed then what's where<br>are your hidden gems um I think my<br>hidden in there there's a there was a<br>few gems hidden in here but they're<br>staying in there don't search for them<br>later uh um my hidden gyms um are<br>probably less places and more people I'm<br>all about the people um if if you don't<br>know who Joshua Middleton is and you<br>want to see Hamilton In a Different<br>Light then you need to get onto social<br>media Google Plus which still exists<br>apparently um Facebook and Twitter<br>Joshua Middleton is a photographer and<br>some of the faces that we see often down<br>Victoria Street who live there um he<br>takes fantastic Street portraitures<br>buildings angles just things you don't<br>see and you go whoa that's that's my<br>city that's unbelievable just incredible<br>Insight so um that sort of stuff and uh<br>I think the the unknowns the great<br>unknowns the best kept secrets of<br>Hamilton is the incredible<br>music scene that we have that or or<br>should I say the musicians that we have<br>because you know we got bands like like<br>devil skin who are cracking it and<br>people don't realize how much they're<br>cracking it how well they're doing we<br>have bands like catcher fire who are<br>touring the world and playing massive<br>shows and they are proudly Hamilton and<br>it's just um it's hardly known and I<br>think it's it's it's exciting that this<br>it's very it makes things vibrant and<br>it's um yeah it's awesome and I like I<br>like what Paul said too I like all those<br>places I'm part of the time<br>sh it's interesting though because I<br>think the human element of Hamilton is a<br>very binding factor of of what makes<br>Hamilton quite a treasure totally um our<br>people and and how they how they just<br>quietly go about being awesome rather<br>than having to be on the cover of every<br>magazine or popping up everywhere in<br>Social feeds and things they're actually<br>just quietly getting about it being<br>awesome putting their pants on one leg<br>at a time not going on too much about it<br>Kim Kardashian<br>anyway professor professor professor<br>Robin where are your favorite places I<br>was kind of hoping maybe you wouldn't<br>get to me on this one okay but but but I<br>was thinking I was thinking about it and<br>I was thinking what what little place<br>might nobody else know about what might<br>you know about and maybe a couple of<br>people in this audience do but at the<br>University I only found this out the<br>other day even though I've been here for<br>half my life there is a vice<br>Chancellor's 12 years tree Grove right<br>you might not have known that but it's<br>got native trees and each time a vice<br>Chancellor moves out of the role another<br>CI tree is planted and it is a very<br>special little spot and I was so kind of<br>struck when I found out about this<br>because I've been here forever it's over<br>by Orchard Park it's very tranquil it's<br>uh it's nice way of kind of recognizing<br>the contribution of the sounds like I'm<br>doing a plug for the University now<br>doesn't it but it's a it's a nice little<br>spot and I never knew about it until the<br>other day and I thought it's probably<br>one of the few places that people in<br>this audience would not know<br>about Point towards it oh there we go<br>that way that's the<br>bar no the bar's that<br>way<br>yeah by Orchard Park Park the halls of<br>residence there's a wonderful little<br>Grove of of um native trees and this is<br>somewhere anyone can go it is and um and<br>I went because our our former Vice<br>Chancellor Roy Crawford planted a tree<br>there the other day and the rain it it<br>rained gently as we were there that<br>would be the tears of the tupon blessing<br>it it was no and it is it's perfect tree<br>planting with very nice moment yeah it<br>would be yeah and I think that's a<br>really interesting part you know we've<br>spoken to three people so far and we've<br>got to move on uh but then but say and<br>saying that though the fact that already<br>everyone's talking about people and<br>talking about land and Our Roots and<br>malom and our our richness at that level<br>in this in this part of the country just<br>it doesn't it speak volumes to already<br>that what we are what we are we can't<br>escape from which is Our Land and our<br>people you know fena T it's great okay<br>we're going to move on to the Scotsman<br>apart from the bars yeah any hidden gym<br>bars we should know about yeah it's<br>funny because um I'm quite an<br>adventurous guy so whenever we go<br>anywhere my wife says to me can we relax<br>and I say no we've got to go and<br>discover things and so I'm always going<br>all over the place and I discover things<br>I come back thinking I've found this<br>wonderful spot and I tell people and<br>they say didn't you know about that and<br>and and and all of a sudden I realize<br>you know I've been sort of had my head<br>under under a bed somewhere and I<br>haven't noticed it but you know classic<br>example would be that nipping down<br>Victoria Street and saying wonder what's<br>down this Lane way let's go down this<br>Wonder Horse is down this laneway or or<br>or going along um Nisbet street by the<br>by the witeck there and what's at the<br>end of oh maybe it's made to order so<br>basically and contrary to The Stereotype<br>I don't actually embibe too much but I<br>do enjoy a nice one and Wonder Horse and<br>also uh maybe it's made to order so<br>those kind of things you know going down<br>the river with my wife and I will down<br>the river on a bike push bike or<br>whatever and popping up and finding a<br>Suburban Cafe like cinnamon or you know<br>somewhere else you know it's quite nice<br>Discovery and as I say everyone knows<br>about them I'm just discovering them<br>myself now know but those kind of things<br>yeah great nice one and and what about<br>yourself Julia what are your hidden<br>treasures well one thing that I've been<br>pleasantly surprised about recently<br>coming back to Hamilton was the um the<br>coffee and the cafe scene in Hamilton is<br>awesome at the moment um it's so great<br>to be able to take our friends from<br>Oakland that come down to visit and show<br>them this great Cafe um and show off<br>Hamilton I think Hamilton East is<br>probably the exciting thing for me at<br>the moment um with the ice cream shop<br>duck Island Ice Cream coming in two<br>birds eery it just feels like it's<br>starting to get a little bit of a<br>Precinct feel starting to get a bit more<br>like the west side I'm sorry West is<br>best just quietly just just say just<br>putting it out<br>there interesting you should say that<br>though because there is I find the the<br>coffee scene has exploded in the last 15<br>years in Hamilton and it's become a real<br>past time for hamiltonians as well to go<br>out and have coffee now you know as<br>opposed to go down the the C for a bit<br>to lunch before you head off to whatever<br>anyway we're going to finish off with<br>our recent<br>import down the back there any head and<br>gems I mean three years is long enough<br>Jason to be here to sort of know a a<br>little bit about what's going on it<br>takes years to peel back the layers of<br>the onion oh stop it um I would say my<br>head and Gem is another natural feature<br>of Hamilton and if anyone's been to TI<br>has anyone been to TI to Bome yay<br>fantastic um it is not that big white<br>Dairy Factory out towards Barnsville<br>that's called tartur okay T is really<br>collection of trees are and it's um it<br>was obviously gifted to the city and if<br>you ever go out there in Autumn it is<br>awesome I mean you just see the changing<br>colors of all the trees it's quiet there<br>crazy chickens um yeah as you know take<br>don't they as opposed to as opposed to<br>uh friendly chickens that um gift you<br>eggs range crazy and you can get married<br>there yeah you can no roses but you know<br>really cool places yeah it's a really<br>beautiful space I personally I'm really<br>excited about what's happening at the<br>meteor that was my hidden G Choice the<br>meteor literary Salon which happens once<br>a month where you get readers and<br>writers coming in and talking and<br>reading their work and reading essays<br>and um a really nice Synergy with um<br>some University artists and res<br>residents have done stuff there the<br>performance Cafe that they have there<br>which is free to Roll Along to I mean<br>you're going to see some really textured<br>carryon are you the adult oh not me no<br>um I'm retired I I do uni gcks um but<br>that that's a really really special<br>place I think and really coming into its<br>own and if you do get out to Ragin which<br>isn't really Hamilton but it kind of is<br>don't tell them that cuz W precious much<br>but go out to Downy hyway road to Ragin<br>recycling center to kaho's Nest the most<br>amazing clothing used items and all the<br>money which is different to Hamilton's<br>dump shop which all goes to a private<br>concern just quietly um all the money<br>that's raised at cah NES goes back into<br>recycling an environment issue and and<br>initiatives in Ragin and honestly and<br>the free pile allocate an hour come on<br>let's<br>get this whole outfit serious um I wased<br>it shut up um anyway so yeah some great<br>hidden gems and I'm sure you've got a<br>lot of your own so please if you are<br>tweeting from the gig love the Tron<br>hidden gems do it Tweet now tweet it [ __ ]<br>abso tley we're going to move on though<br>to um something that I think is quite<br>interesting um people talking track<br>about Hamilton quite quite frankly I I<br>reviewed a Comedy Festival show a couple<br>of years ago five International male<br>comedians and each one of them came out<br>they'd only been in the country maybe<br>three or four days and each of them came<br>out and had a derogatory joke about<br>Hamilton when the fifth guy came out and<br>he started I went not again and he went<br>oh sorry in his accent let's make him<br>British or dork um he just went oh sorry<br>that's what we were told is the place to<br>take the piss out of as a hamiltonian<br>that oh you know I did the it's okay<br>face um but it's I mean it's hard you've<br>got no right of response when you're in<br>the audience of a show but it's weird<br>when you think that people out there are<br>are calling up our town as the place to<br>take the fun out of and and so I throw<br>it to you guys maybe to Jason first of<br>all because I I feel like you might have<br>some Assurant comic um for people who<br>talk smack about our town okay I would<br>normally have a lovely pause go hm look<br>thoughtful thoughtful is really good and<br>then say I'm trying to see it from your<br>point of view but unfortunately I cannot<br>get my he through the smog pollution and<br>traic congestion from where you're from<br>so that's pretty much<br>us yeah there is a lot of it that comes<br>from North actually there's a lot of<br>orlanders that like to unleash the hates<br>on us and I mean Jess you're originally<br>from denan so you're very fortunate to<br>be allowed here and then to stay Cal<br>privilege um but you know I I grew up<br>with it in denan too right because denan<br>is is like the gum boot of New Zealand<br>it's it's it's right down the bottom<br>there and I love denan still not nearly<br>as much as I love the Tron but it's okay<br>don't tell them that so recording it oh<br>a my mom's not going to be pleased you<br>know what I see I see it a bit like<br>people people tear shreds off Hamilton<br>and I see it a bit like when I grew up<br>my sister was allowed to take the Mickey<br>out of me she was allowed to say<br>whatever she wanted about me I was<br>allowed to say what I wanted about her<br>not really she'd give me a hiding she's<br>older than me that's why uh she gave me<br>hiding it's not that I'm weak maybe a<br>little bit but but like you know<br>anybody she yeah anybody else say<br>something about me and my sister's the<br>first to be wagging the finger oh no you<br>didn't I'm sorry it's it's the same sort<br>of thing you know we yeah yeah she's<br>yeah she's a small aggressive yeah<br>anyway<br>um distracting me<br>boys stop it<br>so we're just GNA throw quickly to Julia<br>what's<br>your I've got I've got something I say<br>can I go no and respect but are we have<br>we found it I've found it the my my my<br>best comeback is well it's nice<br>to awesome it's nice to see that your<br>mind's so open so open in fact that even<br>intelligent thought just passes straight<br>through it beautiful I think that I<br>think that's pretty good I think that's<br>pretty good yeah they usually go well<br>that's right because that little gap's<br>shut again exactly Julia what about<br>yourself I mean you've spent a bit of<br>time living in Orland you've only just<br>recently immigrated back yeah we we got<br>a pretty tough time when we said we were<br>moving back to Hamilton all the jokes<br>came out which they they were pretty<br>lame to be honest um and I got a lot<br>working in tourism as well because<br>everyone's got their 10 cents um I used<br>to just say to people but it's the city<br>of the future um I don't know if it<br>worked I was I was no I wasn't ever very<br>good at comebacks but to be quite honest<br>I was so proud of coming from Hamilton<br>being in Oakland that not many people<br>slagged it off um until the very end<br>when we were leaving because they knew<br>how passionate we were about Hamilton<br>and yeah we were just lucky that we we<br>didn't get it too much but it's<br>certainly there in Oakland they're just<br>jealous though I think I was living in<br>Oakland when I got offered the job at<br>Mor in 2002 and everyone went if you<br>move there your life is up<br>over and the thing was I was like no way<br>I've felt an intense amount of<br>opportunity here and and the weird thing<br>is that when it came time for that<br>contract to end I thought oh my God I<br>got go back to Orland now because this<br>is where my real life began you know I<br>think this is where you find your place<br>to stand I feel for lots of<br>people Robin as a professor of geography<br>as well professor of geography as a<br>Hamilton born and bread I'm just totally<br>over the trash talking Hamilton the Paul<br>Henry comments that you know I'm just<br>it's kind of tired it's tired and I<br>think these days I just I don't engage<br>with it I'm just no because I think all<br>it ends up in is this kind of bidding<br>war about place you know so is is the<br>Tron better than paliston North is pist<br>North better than Mana orara or I don't<br>want to go there it's just it's a kind<br>of place-based discrimination it's<br>bullying it's like no over<br>it inago<br>and on and on it goes how do you know<br>the place is in the hierarchy yeah yeah<br>Hamilton and well what it's weird though<br>when you see in media that every year<br>there's another study out about the most<br>Progressive city in the world or the<br>most user friendly city in the world or<br>the most fun city or the most<br>business-minded or what did Wellington<br>get it for Wendy I don't know whatever I<br>grew up in<br>Wellington dead to me but I I but but<br>that's the thing there's always there's<br>always going to be some overarching yeah<br>thing some Media or some over presence<br>that is going to encourage people to<br>think about their own<br>worth uh in relation to where they live<br>or where they come from and that's so<br>that's kind of sad I think Brian yeah I<br>just I just you left Ed yeah thank you<br>look I I just think that um the most<br>negative comments that I've received<br>from about Hamilton have been people who<br>perhaps don't know anything about<br>Hamilton to be honest when you drill<br>down to it they haven't lived here they<br>they just got on this bandwagon this<br>sort of stereotype kind of thing and and<br>you know and I it it it's a bit like um<br>ockland is to New Zealand is can I say<br>the US is to the world they're kind of a<br>bit self absor sorry they can be in a<br>bit of a dome like like remember that<br>drama on television the Dome you know<br>it's hard to get out hard to get in uh<br>it's kind of similar and and and yeah I<br>think we we should take a sense of<br>healthy pride in in our in our city and<br>we got a lot to offer we have indeed<br>thank you nice way to finish too I'm<br>going to I'm going to go down to this<br>question so I think this is quite<br>interesting and I might actually go back<br>and start with you Brian if you could<br>open a business in Hamilton<br>tomorrow what would it be and why thank<br>you so much uh thank you for that um you<br>know I I thought about this and I you<br>know there's there's Utopia there's you<br>know there's a whole bunch of stuff but<br>you know I actually think I'd probably<br>start the business that I'm in at the<br>moment and it sounds almost cliche you<br>must expect that but actually really I<br>Jizzy see I actually think that the<br>physical environment where we live what<br>surrounds us how we interact has a great<br>effect on our health both individually<br>emotionally physically but but also<br>corporately socially the environment in<br>which we you know within which we live<br>and so I think I'd probably be involved<br>in architecture and Urban Design I think<br>I probably do that again that's fun<br>yeah you know what that is I could think<br>of anything else that's what that is<br>right there Jesse if you could if you<br>could open a business like the world<br>your oyster well I'd get Brian to design<br>it for a start you're a champion right<br>the Band of Brothers H honestly um it's<br>there's nothing new but it would be Cafe<br>SL bar<br>SL music instrument store allinone with<br>awesome couches and chill out spaces<br>pretty much my lounge sort of like<br>friends yeah a little bit like honestly<br>like like Hamilton people are so cool<br>coffee is awesome beer is Awesome music<br>is Awesome People Are Awesome imagine<br>all of that just like chilling out I'd<br>be like in heaven if I could hang out in<br>that and that could be my business just<br>actually free coffee free beer it<br>doesn't matter free coffee I'd be<br>terrible at business it just I wouldn't<br>make much money from it but that would<br>be cool that's what I do vote for me for<br>me don't don't<br>okay so from anothers I it's interesting<br>because we've got our three Imports<br>sitting on one side and our three local<br>produce over here but Jason what would<br>you do what would you do with the town<br>um I would probably I think the city<br>would would would really Thrive with a<br>really good old fashioned department<br>store I mean I've grown up with<br>department stores and I think Hamilton<br>we used to have if you all know di deer<br>we had all that but actually can anyone<br>remember the original department store<br>no that we had on Victoria Street and<br>they they won like awards for the window<br>displays house house very and they like<br>one best window display in the New York<br>Times like back in the 50s like these<br>guys were world class and and we don't<br>have one and I would love to have a<br>really cool obviously not a not a<br>farmers type department store but kind<br>of touching what these guys said the<br>best of everything I'd have a rooftop<br>bar run by good George fantastic that<br>would be cool then I would have like a<br>big Atrium like like the old Farmers<br>department store and in there would be<br>milk and honey bring back milk and honey<br>I mean we miss milk and honey don't we<br>in the city great<br>you'd have music lots of music vinyl DJs<br>um lots of stuff live music that would<br>be really cool you'd have gothamberg<br>downstair you have a food market I love<br>Foods there's going to be lots of food<br>in there like a big dungeon full of food<br>of all the great things Donovan's<br>chocolate zong tea all the great stuff<br>we produce right here in Hamilton and<br>then yeah then you just have couches<br>actually that would be quite cool can I<br>sit up can I sit up as part of yours<br>well that's the thing I think that if<br>you were going to take over the world<br>with a with a well take over Hamilton<br>with a really Savvy department store I<br>think it's something that would be built<br>on a lot of the personalities and the<br>people that do create and and produce in<br>this in the city so yeah and I don't see<br>any reason why not farmers and the<br>warehouse and centralized distribution<br>has kind of wrecked um specialty<br>shopping to a certain degree and I do<br>feel there is um a great need to<br>increase uh medium density housing in<br>the center of the city to get people<br>back into our city CU if you've been in<br>the city at 8:30 on a Saturday night<br>it's fair very quiet and it should be<br>really busy and you know we've got a<br>wonderful big mall that we can be really<br>proud of uh because it's the biggest in<br>the Southern Hemisphere by Croy even<br>then you can't get a park sometimes oh<br>Shivers me<br>timers but you know we have to pull<br>people back from those environments and<br>give them a center of the city they want<br>to be that they want to be in and I<br>think part of that living you know<br>living in the center of the city which I<br>did and I loved so yeah Paul what would<br>you open I me you opened a bar and that<br>was pretty good that was good fun I<br>shouldn't be left in charge of such<br>things there's not much he should be<br>left in charge of to dressing himself<br>radioactive material yeah f with that<br>yeah we get on well um no uh what I'd<br>like to do because the art is very close<br>to me um I'd really like to have a<br>big ideally a huge building that's got<br>rehearsal rooms for bands it's got<br>rehearsal rooms for drama groups and<br>things like that it's got um a recording<br>facility so I mean I've been to<br>Australia and and just hung out with<br>friends over there who playing bands and<br>they they drive downtown and go<br>underground to this amazing space and<br>it's just like all these [ __ ] out<br>rooms that have got PA equipment in them<br>it's really easy for the bands to come<br>and go um there's a little shop there<br>that sells guitar strings and pies<br>awesome and great com great com no beer<br>though I put beer in mine probably but<br>no couches otherwise you never get rid<br>of these guys that's true the loue<br>lizards I'd love to do some sort of<br>space like that for you know to really<br>encourage musicians cuz it's it's bloody<br>hard for bands when you don't have a<br>space to make a record in you it's true<br>and I think we got some amazing talent<br>in this we do we do Julia what would you<br>open what would you be your business if<br>I wanted to make some money at the<br>moment I'd become a real estate agent in<br>Hamilton first home buyers if anyone's<br>get a house we're trying to BU no but on<br>a serious note um bringing International<br>media into Hamilton they always used to<br>ask what happened happens on the river<br>where's the cafe on the river where's<br>the restaurants on the river and um I'm<br>really excited about the Hamilton City<br>River plan I think that's awesome but it<br>would be good to see it happening a bit<br>faster but my thing that I would open is<br>a a cafe on the river and lead the way<br>like I think what they're doing with<br>Riverside Mall is is really cool and I<br>think it would be great to see that<br>happening a little bit more in the CBD<br>TR bring a few more people in yeah in<br>gothberg yeah oh and it's it's a<br>beautiful River and we should be<br>utilizing it it's it's a gym of our city<br>and yeah I think it would be great to<br>see a lot more happening down there and<br>it is it it draws people back into the<br>center of the city you know it's just<br>changing changing things oh I've gone<br>I've gone into a reflective space I'd<br>really I have really no because I'd<br>really like to yeah thank you thanks<br>Professor Dr<br>Robin what would you open if you just<br>decided oh this University I think I'll<br>have your sort of basement in your Posh<br>department store for a sort of gourmet<br>food space because I really lament um<br>Nosh The Gourmet Supermarket closing in<br>2013 and there was something else out at<br>TA at the base another far closed as<br>well so I feel like hamiltonians are are<br>in there eating at a lot of we've got a<br>lot of wonderful restaurants chimery and<br>you know all sorts gothenburg's moved<br>down by the river but I feel we need<br>more gourmet food supplies for our own<br>little din<br>we have at home although we do have uh<br>the massive farmers<br>market and that is good there is now a<br>smaller Breakaway faction hor rbl down<br>at the old venue of the Hamilton Farmers<br>Market down at the um claudin car or the<br>car park of yeah the bridge and um<br>fantastic great eggs and you know it's<br>good to see Mr roach and remind of who<br>you are every week I love it he's losing<br>it I love it um and no and so that's<br>really great I myself would love to set<br>up a toasty Nook for toasted sandwiches<br>yes I like it I love Toasties look at<br>people clapping that all right we're<br>doing it um but can we do all of these<br>things we could do we could do all of<br>these things we could do all of these<br>things the other thing I'd really like<br>to see for Hamilton is for Hamilton's<br>amazing Mental Health Services and<br>Outreach and creative therapy that we<br>have um in in the center of the city um<br>become more available and more visible<br>in our town cuz actually we've got a lot<br>of creative people who are you know<br>anyway we're going to move on because we<br>have to and it's just it's going to go<br>to a place we all might just have to<br>drop everything in hgen but you know<br>we're we all know what I'm talking about<br>right depression isn't something we just<br>Chuck in the corner and figure it'll go<br>away when you eventually and it's very<br>much come to the FL given that our our<br>you know Farm strong has bought Ral<br>depression out into the four and I think<br>that that's one of many many mental<br>health issues that are going on in our<br>community and just by makinging it a<br>little bit more visible and making it a<br>little bit less all tuck it away might<br>actually help uh in recovery and<br>management as well as awareness raising<br>and you know Hamilton is a trailblazing<br>town so we could really make a mark<br>there yeah agreed um okay so what we're<br>going to do now is we're just going to<br>go down to this one and I think we've<br>already answered the question because<br>everyone's decided that we're going to<br>have<br>a a super store in the middle of a super<br>department store and everyone's going to<br>have their little knock of it um but is<br>Hamilton a<br>village yes or no good or bad are we are<br>we a village Robin well no the<br>geographer in me says No Villages are<br>just they they sort of have couple of<br>hundred or maybe a thousand people but<br>when I think of Village I think of I<br>think of Retirement Village I think of<br>little sort ofap we do I think of Mis<br>marle murder mysteries I I don't know<br>maybe Cambridge a village but Hamilton I<br>think we're a proper City<br>we we we've got a there's a whole lot of<br>difference and in ages ethnicities and<br>and different populations I I feel I<br>don't feel the village I think we're<br>City but I know what you're saying about<br>communities there's certainly lots of<br>communities and within the city but but<br>no I'm not feeling the village thing I<br>guess can I yes yes Jess thanks thanks J<br>maray I think I guess um cuz I I see<br>what you're saying there Robin and I<br>think um my immediately when I hear are<br>we a vill I think of are we do do we<br>pull together are we together in things<br>are supposed to I'm not a geographer I'm<br>not I'm not and I know my wife and I we<br>Foster we have foster children and um we<br>lit we tell our friends often who go oh<br>I couldn't do what you do we say you<br>don't need to do what we do you just<br>need to be part of that Village because<br>the saying is it takes a village to<br>raise a child right even more so when<br>it's a child that you know nothing about<br>it's it's it's like man if we don't have<br>Community we got nothing and that's one<br>of the things I love and it that goes<br>back to some of what we've said already<br>Hamilton and its<br>people something just just something you<br>don't find many other places the way the<br>people will come together the you know<br>we didn't really know each other before<br>we met tonight you know and and some<br>conversations just beforehand and it's<br>all like yeah we're in this together<br>Let's Take On The World and like we know<br>that we know that we're let's open a<br>department store change the world yeah I<br>have catches he'll practice rooms and<br>but but like in everyone in this room<br>you know we've come it's called and O to<br>Hamilton and it's like you come because<br>that's of Interest we're like you know<br>what and oh to<br>Hamilton together Village I I picture if<br>a village got attacked we it'll be in it<br>together fighting for this Village you<br>know putting out the fires that that the<br>the mean people from Robin Hood are<br>trying to Fire and can we be Village<br>mentality but City strong o catchphrase<br>yeah absolutely ask questions in<br>206 absolutely absolutely yeah yep I say<br>absolutely yeah cool de I think there's<br>something about the whole and I tend to<br>agree with you from I guess a a literal<br>perspective but there's something about<br>the word Village that conjur up for me a<br>sense of of a relational<br>intimacy uh of our city that that I<br>don't think we can get in larger cities<br>by that I mean um come with me to pack<br>and save not literally<br>come with me in your imagination to I<br>and<br>say I I've had a I've had a stou with<br>some business person I've had a stou<br>with him or her and and I'm walking down<br>past the little campfire that people<br>tend to have in the middle of back and<br>safe and toasting marshmallows and get<br>around them anyway you go past them and<br>around around the aisle comes towards<br>you someone this person that you<br>actually had to stou with and I have a<br>choice do I do the moon walking back or<br>pretend I'm on the phone or do I pretend<br>I'm picking out my big beans and<br>colleting pams over whatever and I the<br>reality is it dawned to me I've actually<br>got engaged with that person so I cannot<br>burn bridges in this city I cannot burn<br>Bridges equally that person could be my<br>client who comes to me and says to me so<br>how is the job going I've got to be<br>responsive with my with my business I've<br>going to be aile resp I'll see them at<br>the next Chamber of Commerce function or<br>or or watching the kids playing soccer<br>on Saturday morning I'll see them and I<br>could say I could say John JN Marie I<br>could say oh we started it which code<br>for I haven't started<br>it If we're honest uh but I've got to be<br>honest about you know so it helps to<br>keep us responsive so I think that<br>relational intimacy level is is is good<br>in Hamilton which I don't see in larger<br>cities yeah that is definitely something<br>that when The Outsiders come down I<br>don't need to call them orlanders just<br>us they're coming down they come down<br>when the when when The Outsiders come<br>down I had a friend recently who's lived<br>a long time overseas come back to New<br>Zealand lived in Oakland went back to<br>Wellington for a while and is now<br>working in otor of all places but you<br>know like from from all this<br>Metropolitan carry on to the three days<br>before her job started she came and<br>stayed with us and I took her to the<br>farmers's market and she went oh it's<br>amazing how she asked a question just<br>under her breath and the stor holder<br>went oh honey where you need to go as a<br>and she went that person talked to me<br>like they knew me did you do you know<br>that person Jen no oh my God it's amaz<br>like she like she helped me like she<br>knew me yeah so we we have that real<br>strength here okay we're a village I can<br>see all right okay everybody no no we're<br>a collection of<br>villagers because we have cool<br>neighborhoods we've got Frankton we've<br>got Hamilton East we've got queenwood<br>we've got St Andrews we've got all these<br>cool little Villages and that's but the<br>cool thing is like what you guys have<br>seen we we are a village overall because<br>it's the you know we we have a cathedral<br>I think The Bishop's here we we have a<br>cathedral as well we have a Town Square<br>we have all these initial Landmark<br>features of a village that actually<br>people are abound to um but we have all<br>that great values of of a Great Village<br>and I think that's and and the gift of<br>giving like this city gives I've never<br>lived anywhere where people give so much<br>whether it be their time whether it be<br>we've been built on our benefactors or<br>the the forefathers of our city that<br>have given so much to what we have in<br>our city today we've got world class<br>facilities here and that's been because<br>of what we've created as a city you know<br>the Hamilton Gardens were were built by<br>the city it's an old dump but now look<br>at it it's world class award-winning<br>Gardens but hamiltonians built it<br>Founders I mean I of course i' got the<br>council speak I could go on about our<br>great facilities but you know pretty<br>much the good stuff the good stuff a<br>collection of villages with the village<br>feel I like it nice nice way nice way to<br>finish that nice way to finish that off<br>I<br>we it's obvious right now we're not<br>going to get through all seven right the<br>Magnificent seven questions are we're<br>going to become like the Magnificent<br>five pretty<br>swiftly as MC I need to choose which<br>question and I<br>just I think we can do this real quick<br>I'm going to throw it to Julia do we<br>need a campaign to bring people<br>back to the Tron no I think the Oakland<br>house prices are doing it for<br>us but that's not trollers that's just<br>people I think on a serious note though<br>I think we need to do some work around<br>bringing um some skilled workers into<br>Hamilton and for example at smart track<br>at the moment we we're trying to recruit<br>for some um what are they de developers<br>sorry I should know that work with them<br>every day and and we're struggling to<br>get developers um to work for us I think<br>there's a need to do a little bit of<br>work to get um some particular jobs back<br>to Hamilton but um it's it's exciting to<br>see how many people are coming back<br>three of our um friends from Oakland<br>they're all in the process of moving<br>back um some from Christ Church yeah I<br>think I think we're doing<br>okay I'm going to put it out there as<br>someone who I was my parents were<br>married here and had my older sister<br>here and then then they moved to<br>Wellington to have me or had me there<br>and I grew up there and I no amount of<br>campaigning is going to bring me back to<br>Wellington Hamilton is my two of w whyde<br>this is where I need to be this is where<br>I feel this is home so<br>so do we need a campaign to bring people<br>back I think what we need to do is be<br>the great City we are and want people to<br>be part of that I think people will come<br>back once they come back and visit<br>everyone needs to go away sometimes want<br>to get out you want need to experience<br>the world but then when you come back<br>and people come back like Julian they<br>come back after three or four years and<br>they go oh my God the city's changed and<br>you look at you look at it through a<br>different eyes because you appreciate<br>what you've got here once you leave it's<br>sounds terrible but when you come back<br>you then realize this is a great City it<br>is the most livable city in the country<br>and um got great it's different we don't<br>need a campaign people will naturally<br>experience it and think yep no I'm going<br>home now we're going to come back to<br>Hamilton yeah but you're towy we<br>essentially you're from Fang is there<br>ever going to be campaign in the Metro<br>magazine that sucks you back up to F I<br>can't see any argument I can't I've been<br>back to Wellington St yeah see you oh I<br>I don't I don't but I guess what the<br>Hamilton's different I guess if I'd been<br>born here I might say the same and that<br>people do need to go away to come back<br>and appreciate it but I I don't feel<br>anyone that's going to be brought back<br>to Hamilton by a shiny advertising<br>campaign I don't I don't feel I don't<br>know that we want them can can I speak<br>yes you can speak now well because I<br>googled this so I want to share I want<br>to share what I found on Google there<br>have been some appalling campaigns for<br>places this was the big thing in the<br>'90s is that cities decided they all<br>needed their campaigns to try and bring<br>in people and here are a few Classics<br>apparently in 1995 the Hut Valley<br>promoted its city with the slogan right<br>up my Hut<br>Valley and they produced 2,000<br>promotional<br>stickers oh 2,000 another and here's<br>another good one denan head it's all<br>right here that's what they said I<br>remember it do you remember they don't<br>turn left they never turn left and do<br>always turn<br>right it's all right it's all right here<br>you get them in<br>control tuty<br>tuty denan had a slogan it's all right<br>here but of course people wrote in and<br>said that it sounds more like it's okay<br>here I guess like it's all right as<br>opposed to it's all all right so you can<br>see how these things can go terribly<br>wrong an actual fact and Foxton had<br>Foxton the fox town before in 2005 they<br>took down the welcome sign deciding it<br>really wasn't going to work but we've<br>had our own disasters we've had the<br>Hamilton more than you expect of<br>course how how much more shy retiring<br>youngest sister of the family that was<br>never heard is that a<br>Hamilton just<br>got where was city of we had Fountain<br>City without really having any fountains<br>we have the fountain no we've got a<br>there's a fountain by the roundabout by<br>Fountain Center it just never goes yeah<br>and we've got a Fountain City Motel<br>which is sort of a hangover from The<br>Fountain
