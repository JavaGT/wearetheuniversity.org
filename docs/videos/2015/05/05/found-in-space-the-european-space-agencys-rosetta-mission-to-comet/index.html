vice chancellor of research<br>at this university the university of<br>waikato i'd like to welcome you here<br>tonight to warwick holmes lecture and<br>i've had the pleasure of speaking to<br>warwick for the last 15 minutes<br>and i've had an idea of the insights<br>about what this lecture is going to be<br>about<br>there's many things to mention in<br>particular about the a man who's very<br>humble and stresses that he was not<br>brilliant at school but it was through<br>to hard work and diligence<br>but the link i must draw at this point<br>is not just the diligence and the hard<br>work it's also the<br>the scholars that he learned from and in<br>particular one of our own professors<br>jonathan scott would you please stand so<br>the work that has made warwick very<br>famous of late especially in the media<br>he's been um<br>almost trying to trump the prime<br>minister on the ponytail story<br>good luck with that<br>it has been with his work with the<br>european space agency and in particular<br>the rosetta spacecraft which is<br>making a new understanding not just<br>around mars and the asteroids but<br>actually landing on a comet and as was<br>explained to me before this will change<br>our way the journey not just of small<br>parts of space but the entire way that<br>i've been told to emphasize that<br>the importance of what warwick does in<br>terms<br>of his scholarship and his contribution<br>of over 29 years in the agency is in<br>terms of science and space exploration<br>but my<br>view of his work is somewhat different<br>in the sense that i come at matters as a<br>lawyer and someone with an interest in<br>history and humanity<br>and i see the work that has been carried<br>out by people like warwick homes is<br>changing the way that we see ourselves<br>as a species<br>it takes not just reason<br>and science it takes a question of<br>identity and to me it's the vision of<br>what the future of cooperation looks<br>like<br>well good evening to you all and welcome<br>to waikato university<br>tonight i'm going to be<br>explaining to you<br>the story of the rosetta spacecraft and<br>it's<br>orbiting and landing on the comet 67p<br>and i'll explain that naming to you<br>later but i'm going to start first of<br>all with a video that was made by a<br>discovery channel documentary just<br>showing the excitement in the control<br>room in darmstadt in germany at the<br>moment just a few moments after the<br>filet lander probe successfully touched<br>down on the comet so i'll just play this<br>for you for a few minutes and then i'll<br>this is it<br>you are watching history being made the<br>first ever landing on a comet<br>i'm dan riskin i am in the most exciting<br>place on the planet right now the<br>european space agency in darmstadt<br>germany and this crowd is cheering<br>because an incredible group of<br>scientists just put a lander on the<br>surface of a moving comet now they made<br>it look easy but this mission and what<br>is it real are we there<br>this is a big step for human<br>civilization<br>desperate to reveal life's origins there<br>are treasure chests with a view back in<br>time<br>a quest decades in the making<br>it's one of the most difficult things<br>you can try an epic adventure to chase<br>down a dragon and ride on its back<br>cherry on the top is really the landing<br>touching down it's all down to isaac<br>newton now where no one has landed<br>before we're moving in for the kiss but<br>first separation anxiety seven agonizing<br>hours i don't have any fingernails<br>they've gone already we are under<br>comments<br>a comet up close with unprecedented<br>clarity we're making history here this<br>is one for the record books we know the<br>so you can see it's a very dramatic<br>event<br>so i'm going to explain how we did all<br>that so tonight i'm going to be<br>presenting i hope answers to these<br>fundamental questions what is the<br>comment and why i visit one<br>how we built and test rosetta in the<br>philly lander<br>the launch and mission highlights to get<br>there comet 67p the images we took when<br>we were there and the landing of the<br>fillet probe onto the surface<br>so what is a comet and why do you want<br>to visit one well<br>the big difference with the comet is<br>that it is a planetary body of our solar<br>system it's it's gravitationally bound<br>to the sun<br>but it's extremely different than all<br>other planetary bodies which have been<br>visited by all other missions<br>during space exploration and that<br>includes all the planets and even the<br>sun itself<br>the planets in the sun have been heated<br>by the process of gravitational collapse<br>and by obviously the fusion of the<br>nuclear reaction of the sun<br>comets were the original primordial<br>material that first formed when the<br>solar system was forming 4.5 billion<br>years ago<br>and it was the material that was slowly<br>condensing and collapsing under gravity<br>before the sun and the planets existed<br>so there was no light there was very<br>little gravity and it was just this<br>process of elements<br>slowly coming together and making<br>molecules we've never seen before<br>the best analogy i can give it's like<br>burning a piece of paper and never<br>seeing the white piece of paper so the<br>terrestrial planets we live on<br>and the sun have all been burned so that<br>chemistry has been completely changed by<br>heat<br>as of this mission we have never seen a<br>white piece of paper<br>and that's what this mission is all<br>about is trying to understand the<br>chemistry of the white piece of paper<br>the cake mix<br>of our solar system<br>and trying to visit and land on there to<br>find out what chemistry what physical<br>process is what makes a comet<br>i've got 100 slides tonight and i have<br>to go through them fairly quickly so i<br>want to try to give as much information<br>as i can afterwards you can come back<br>and ask us questions at the end of the<br>presentation<br>so this is an image of the early solar<br>system and the<br>cometary material is here on the<br>outermost extent now this picture is a<br>bit misleading because you can see we<br>have a sun<br>and we have some plants that have<br>already formed but if there wasn't a sun<br>there'd be no light and there'd be no<br>image<br>so<br>this is trying to show how cold and dark<br>and miserable<br>the solar system was when comets were<br>made 4.5 billion years ago<br>so the fundamental question is how do we<br>get from this this ball of dust which is<br>from a a supernova explosion another<br>star which has already exploded<br>generated lots of dust and new elements<br>whizzing through space and collapsing to<br>form a new star a new solar system how<br>do we get from that gas and dust to<br>planet earth with water<br>to intelligent human life<br>here at waikato university every single<br>one of you is made of cometary dust<br>from the elements of a supernova<br>explosion more than 4.5 billion years<br>ago how did we all get here how can we<br>make a spacecraft to go back and land on<br>the comet<br>so<br>this is a video just briefly showing the<br>process of the cometary bombardment<br>during the formation of the earth when<br>it was still a red-hot molten ball of<br>magma<br>this is before any of the oceans formed<br>and the planet was still cooling down<br>and then there was a secondary<br>bombardment phase which brought what we<br>believe the water for the oceans and the<br>primordial chemistry to start the<br>evolution of human life of all life<br>so<br>we had a tantalizing glimpse of what a<br>comet was like when this meteorite came<br>and hit australia called the murchison<br>meteorite<br>and inside this meteorite they realize<br>that there's something very strange<br>because when it hit this town of<br>murchison which is in victoria in<br>australia the residents of the town<br>saw they saw it come in there was this<br>enormous bang as it went at the sonic<br>speed through the atmosphere but there<br>was a smell that was left behind the<br>smell of bitumen and wet hay was the<br>best way that they could describe it i<br>thought well that's very strange what on<br>earth is that<br>they analyzed this the chemistry of this<br>rock and found more than 100 amino acids<br>in this rock from<br>the outer extent of our solar system<br>because i realized that this was in fact<br>an evaporated core of a comet<br>there are only 20 amino acids on planet<br>earth and in all of our bodies so<br>there's an extra 80 amino acids in this<br>rock from space which we've never seen<br>before we know what the the chemistry of<br>them looks like we can make them in a<br>lab but they do not occur naturally on<br>earth so we realized immediately<br>something very very strange was going on<br>with comets and we wanted to go out<br>there and find out what it was<br>so inside this piece of murchison they<br>did some<br>very advanced chemistry and they found<br>what they call nucleotides and this is<br>the bonding<br>molecules which are used for helping to<br>connect the rna and dna chains together<br>and this is a very exotic chemistry that<br>we found just on what we thought was an<br>inert rock from deep space it's anything<br>but it brought with it the fundamental<br>chemistry that helped kick start<br>life it didn't it didn't have life<br>itself it was too cold and too small and<br>in a hard vacuum but it had these the<br>building blocks of lego blocks to help<br>make life very quickly<br>so how do we how do we get out to a<br>comet now the problem is comets are<br>moving very fast and they're very far<br>from the sun<br>so we had to to catch the comet which we<br>planned the mission for we had to get an<br>extra 50 000 kilometers an hour of speed<br>and the largest rocket we have and all<br>the fuel in the spacecraft was only<br>going to get 8 800 kilometers of extra<br>speed to catch the comet which is<br>nowhere near enough so we had to design<br>a mission that used what we call gravity<br>assist and that is we fly around the sun<br>and we synchronize with planets<br>to get the gravity of those planets to<br>pull us forward a bit like a<br>skateboarder grabbing the back of a<br>bicycle to get an<br>acceleration to go down the road but we<br>have to wait for the right bicycle to<br>come past going the right direction to<br>grab it to go in the right direction so<br>this was the whoops i'm sorry<br>i missed the video<br>okay so this video shows<br>that process of<br>planetary gravity assist of the 12 years<br>to get the spacecraft out to catch<br>okay so this is the launch on the 2nd of<br>march 2004 11 years ago more than 11<br>years ago the white line is the<br>spacecraft we left the earth but we came<br>around and we synchronized with again to<br>get the velocity of the earth to<br>accelerate us forward by 15 000<br>kilometers an hour<br>we went out a bit further then because<br>of that extra boost in speed we came<br>back in<br>and this time we synchronized with mars<br>here on the 25th of february 2007<br>and this changed our direction again to<br>come and hit the earth or not hit the<br>earth get the gravity assist of the<br>earth<br>and we had another very large<br>acceleration another 15 000 kilometers<br>an hour each time the circles are<br>getting larger and larger<br>we went past asteroid steins through the<br>asteroid belt as we went through we just<br>have a look we saw an asteroid we chose<br>back in for a third gravity assist<br>this whole sequence of gravity assists<br>took more than 10 years to finally get<br>the speed to get out to the comet we<br>found another asteroid leticia which<br>i'll show you images of<br>this is the comet out here<br>the problem is we then had to go into<br>hibernation because we're getting so far<br>from the sun the solar panels could not<br>generate enough electricity to keep the<br>spacecraft alive and we had to put it to<br>hibernation i'll explain that as well<br>then we turn it back on again 20th of<br>january this year last year<br>and then we follow the comet for eight<br>months<br>until we do our first orbit around the<br>comet in the 6th of august 2014<br>and then we're mapping the surface and<br>we're starting out very intensive<br>science phase during that during that<br>period<br>the comet slowly becomes active here and<br>we put the lander down before it gets<br>too active that was on the 12th of<br>november<br>and then we're about at this point here<br>at the moment we go past the closest<br>point to the sun called the perihelion<br>on the 13th of august 2015<br>and the mission ends roughly past<br>december in about july of next year<br>so that shows you the complex trajectory<br>that we had to do to actually catch the<br>comet and to get this enormous speed<br>this is what the spacecraft looks like<br>it's rosetta this is the<br>like the mother ship weighs three tons<br>it's got 64 square meters of very very<br>efficient very expensive solar panels to<br>generate the electricity far from earth<br>this is another view showing the filet<br>lander which weighs about 100 kilos so<br>the spacecraft weighs three tonnes when<br>we first launched it 1.7 tonnes of which<br>was fuel fuel only<br>100 kilograms for the lander bolted on<br>the side which we then deployed to put<br>down onto the surface<br>this is just showing a summary of the 11<br>instruments extremely sophisticated<br>instruments which if we're going to go<br>all that way we're going to take the<br>best instruments we can we've got atomic<br>force microscopes mass spectrometers<br>gasco<br>chromatographs<br>rf tomography every ologyoscopy anoma<br>tree you can imagine if we're going to<br>go all that way we're going to make it<br>count okay there are hospitals city<br>hospitals which would be jealous of the<br>instruments this spacecraft has got<br>so this is the lander filet free flying<br>so it's got again 10 instruments on<br>board filet<br>together with its landing gear deployed<br>i won't spend too much time on that<br>because we're running out of time so<br>these are the instruments again as well<br>again mass spectrometers gas<br>chromatography rf tomography everything<br>you can imagine we've even hear in the<br>fate got microphones and a sounding<br>speakers for pinging like sonar peeps<br>into the sound into the body of the<br>comet and it's like um it's like sonar<br>seismology that's what i'm trying to<br>think of<br>so<br>this is my role on some photos of me<br>just working on the spacecraft this is i<br>started 15 years ago in the year 2000<br>worked on it for four and a half years i<br>was actually involved in testing in<br>principle most of the software on the<br>spacecraft so i was doing the building<br>the testing and then the launch<br>up until 2004.<br>so these are different phase photos and<br>different phases drawing a building and<br>testing the spacecraft and went down to<br>french guyana in the top end of south<br>america which is where the european<br>space agency launches most of its<br>missions and we had a dedicated ariane 5<br>just for launch because we were going in<br>such a strange direction<br>this is some views inside the spacecraft<br>so we've got here this laser gyroscopes<br>these are called reaction wheels which<br>are used for moving the spacecraft and<br>an enormous amount of pipe work involved<br>with<br>the 24 little thruster engines we use<br>for moving the spacecraft around in<br>space<br>when we're building the spacecraft we<br>had to test it in a representative<br>environment to be sure that the<br>spacecraft would survive the riggers of<br>deep space and the thing to notice here<br>this is in a 2 000 cubic meter vacuum<br>chamber we pump all the air out<br>in the walls here we flood them with<br>liquid nitrogen to get it down to minus<br>200 degrees celsius<br>and we actually then have to test the<br>spacecraft to have a range of more than<br>300 degrees celsius so imagine you've<br>got a tv set you put it in the fridge<br>and it works in the freezer you're<br>thinking okay that's all right well then<br>put it in the oven at 300 degrees and<br>see if it works<br>this is what rosetta had to<br>endure for 10 years there's enormous<br>temperature range as you're going<br>towards the sun and then further away<br>this is a view of the lander on a<br>vibration table this is where we have to<br>we shake the<br>all the components of the the orbiter<br>and the lander to enormous vibration<br>levels to survive the rigors of the<br>launch of the rocket even though we then<br>drift for 10 years in zero g which is<br>the most benign environment you can<br>imagine the launch is absolutely<br>horrendous so we've got to design it to<br>survive the launch<br>this is view inside the lander and you<br>can see it's probably the most complex<br>box of electronics certainly i've ever<br>seen it was just a saving mass of<br>electronics circuits computers<br>gas chromatography here these little<br>bottles here full of helium for using<br>for our gas<br>chromatography experiments<br>this is the um so we're getting up to<br>the launch now so this is the launch<br>site in french guiana this is the around<br>five being wheeled out for to the launch<br>pad here<br>and<br>on second of march 2004 we were launched<br>off on to start the mission<br>this is the operations center in<br>darmstadt in germany this is the this is<br>the epicenter where all the control of<br>the spacecraft is done<br>but with signals sent via antennas in<br>this case in australia there was there<br>are three antennas we use and this one<br>it was the first one that was built in<br>2002<br>and it's 36 meter diameter and it was<br>the only one for eight years so for the<br>first eight years getting out towards<br>the the furthest extent only this<br>station existed and then two more built<br>in in argentina and in madrid in spain<br>but this is a little bit like the dish<br>movie for apollo 11. this we've got our<br>own little dish story now with this one<br>in western australia that helped rosetta<br>to land on<br>on the comet<br>so we've started the mission and this is<br>one of the flybys it's just an image<br>showing what we think the spacecraft<br>looked like as it flew past mars but<br>this is a real image from<br>filet the lander<br>as we flew past any<br>planetary bodies we turned on all the<br>incidents we could to test them to be<br>sure that they were working before we<br>got out to the comet and this is a<br>little selfie we took with filet looking<br>over the shoulder of<br>rosetta's back of the solar panel from<br>rosetta and looking down onto the moon<br>just 250 kilometers below us<br>traveling at 26 000 kilometers an hour<br>as you flew past we took some images of<br>mars and with different filters we use<br>we have 17 different colored filters<br>and we exercised all of them and this<br>tells us what the components of the<br>chemistry of the atmosphere of mars are<br>for example which one day we'll be doing<br>the same thing when we get to the comet<br>so then we carried on we went past uh<br>asteroid steins for a flyby<br>okay so as we're flying past this is 800<br>kilometers from<br>the asteroid which is the distance from<br>sydney to melbourne sorry i don't know<br>the new zealand equivalent to that but<br>um 31 000 kilometers an hour and it's<br>only six kilometers across so we've got<br>very powerful cameras to zoom in and get<br>these images as we were flying through<br>the asteroid belt<br>to again exercise some of our<br>instruments<br>for when we got to the comet<br>then later on we went past another<br>asteroid this is again going through the<br>asteroid belt<br>sorry is that<br>and<br>this is a much larger asteroid this is<br>the second largest asteroid of the<br>asteroid belt<br>100 kilometers across but this time we<br>were<br>3000 kilometers away<br>and traveling at 56 000 kilometers an<br>hour so these are very fleeting very<br>fast flybys but we still did everything<br>and that was the best image we got from<br>luticio<br>then came the hibernation and this is<br>when we had to turn the spacecraft off<br>for two and a half years we set four<br>timers on board to eight<br>eighty million seconds<br>and all four of them were counting down<br>to zero any two of which got to zero<br>would wake the spacecraft back up again<br>so as we were going out to the furthest<br>point we had to turn the spacecraft off<br>because we didn't have enough electrical<br>power except to keep the time is running<br>that meant turning off the receivers so<br>even in an emergency we couldn't wake<br>the spacecraft up and this is the first<br>time ever this has been done in a deep<br>space mission because if we couldn't<br>turn it back on again that's the end of<br>a two billion dollar project<br>so<br>we waited nervously<br>for the wake up call two and a half<br>years after we turned it off and we had<br>to point the antennas<br>to the equivalent of that black dot on<br>the full moon so half moon so if you see<br>everyone's familiar with the moon that's<br>how accurate we had to point two great<br>big 17 meter antennas to actually pick<br>up this signal if it was going to come<br>anyway<br>so that's how accurate our pointing had<br>to be and these were the two signals we<br>were looking for this is one dish in<br>canberra a 17-meter nasa dish<br>another 70 metre dish in goldston in<br>california and luckily the signal came<br>now this is the details of the orbit of<br>the comet we're trying to catch this is<br>comet 67p<br>the 67th periodic comet the periodic<br>comet is a periodic comet is one which<br>has been captured by<br>jupiter and into a closed orbit a much<br>smaller orbit which means that we<br>actually have a chance of catching it so<br>when we came out of hibernation we're<br>out here in january 2014 it took us<br>eight months<br>to do to catch up to the comet to do our<br>first closed orbit<br>and that's when the really intensive<br>science phase began and so then we did<br>the landing here on the 12th of november<br>2014 and today we read about this arrow<br>here as we're just about to enter the<br>highest activity phase<br>of the comet which is when it starts to<br>evaporate and all these volatile<br>chemistry starts getting blasted off the<br>surface so we did a science phase here<br>where the comet is dormant and we looked<br>at the dormant chemistry and then we're<br>doing another phase here where we look<br>at the active chemistry the whole time<br>the orbiter is following the spacecraft<br>right through to about july 2016<br>when we run out of fuel chemical fuel<br>and then we will land the orbiter onto<br>the comet as well<br>to meet its little lander as well the<br>orbit and the lander on the comet<br>together<br>so today this is where we are looking<br>down on the solar system so this is the<br>orbit of jupiter out here here is mars<br>and earth<br>and we're outside the orbit of mars at<br>the moment traveling at 92 000<br>kilometers an hour<br>387 million kilometers from earth 270<br>emitting from the sun and it takes 21.5<br>minutes<br>for images from the comet to get to<br>earth travelling at the speed of light<br>21 and a half minutes to wait for the<br>speed of light<br>we've traveled a total of 6.9 billion<br>kilometers almost 7 billion kilometers<br>going four times around the sun doing<br>the gravity assists to catch the comet<br>to get to this point today<br>now these are the first images we had as<br>we're approaching the comet this is a<br>million kilometers away and this is our<br>navigation camera that we use for<br>knowing which way we have to go<br>so this is a real-time display of the<br>navigation camera can anybody see the<br>comet in that image<br>okay well<br>just above the red dot one of those<br>stars is stationary<br>i don't know if you can see it it's<br>right above the red dot<br>that is the comet so luckily we were<br>pointing in the right direction<br>and that shows you how difficult the<br>navigation is to try and catch<br>catch the stars to see where we're going<br>okay so these were the first images of<br>the comet as you were coming in this is<br>a<br>in august of uh last year<br>and it's a sequence of still images<br>we've strung together to make like a<br>movie and then we realized that<br>something very very very strange was<br>going on<br>we were not expecting to see this<br>the shape is extremely unusual it looks<br>like two comets which are joined<br>together<br>it's a head and a t and a body that<br>seems to be stuck together with a neck<br>region<br>so<br>somebody of course made the astute<br>observation where it looks like a rubber<br>tell me that's not a rubber duck ten<br>years in orbit to find a duck okay<br>so then we went into orbit and we<br>started a very intensive<br>uh imaging campaign where we were<br>looking<br>for all these new features we've never<br>seen before on a comet this was the<br>first comment that anyone has ever gone<br>into an orbit around or got this close<br>to<br>so um one thing i have to emphasize is<br>that this image knows a nice bright<br>white comet okay well in reality<br>this the surface of this comet is<br>blacker than coal dust<br>it's like the toner cartridge powder you<br>get in a photocopier we've got extremely<br>powerful and very very sensitive cameras<br>which can enhance the brightness and the<br>contrast to actually see this thing only<br>six percent of the light reflects off<br>the surface of this comet we're at a<br>distance where the solar power is at one<br>tenth of the brightness we have here at<br>earth so only point six percent of the<br>light actually comes off the comet which<br>is<br>absolutely invisible if it was standing<br>right here beside us we wouldn't see it<br>it'd be just a black nothing<br>so these images are truly incredible<br>what we've done here is we've even<br>enhanced the using the filters the<br>colored filters to find out what the<br>true color looks like again we're having<br>to enhance it to even show it to you but<br>this is what the true color of a comet<br>looks like<br>and then we're flying around and just<br>every feature every image we took we<br>found features and unusual things we've<br>never seen before so here again is<br>another selfie by filet looking over the<br>shoulder of of<br>solar panel that's the back of the solar<br>panel with the comet in the foreground<br>with a few gas jets coming off<br>and we<br>started an important thing to realize<br>too not only is this<br>the surface of this is jet black blacker<br>than coal dust everything you're looking<br>at does not exist on earth<br>these are not boulders they're frozen<br>chunks of ice which are gases<br>it's frozen carbon dioxide frozen carbon<br>monoxide frozen nitrous oxide frozen<br>methane these are not boulders it's<br>frozen chunks of gaseous ice together<br>with maybe amino acids we haven't we<br>haven't found that out yet we're still<br>looking so there's a lot of carbon<br>chemistry a lot of polyurethane<br>hydrocarbons they're called it's like<br>soot chemistry and frozen gases<br>even though it looks like a hard surface<br>it looked like it could be somewhere in<br>switzerland<br>it certainly isn't<br>none of this surface none of this<br>chemistry corresponds to anything on<br>planet earth<br>so<br>these are again just i'm just giving you<br>a series of images to show you the<br>surface<br>features<br>and<br>the unusual surface features i should<br>say<br>and everywhere we look we're seeing<br>unusual things it's a very rough<br>surface very you can see it's very old<br>it's been a lot of<br>aging on this parole comet it's 4.5<br>billion years old and yes indeed it is<br>old<br>so then we had to start looking i'll<br>just show you this here this is where we<br>have some craters now these are not<br>impact craters or volcanic radars<br>certainly not volcanic it's way too cold<br>these are where basically<br>gas and volatile components inside the<br>comet have evaporate and they come<br>through and they form these like<br>evaporation<br>volcanoes i guess you could we could<br>call them<br>so we put<br>many thousands of images together to<br>make a simulated<br>fly around the comet so this is about 20<br>000 images have been stitched together<br>to make a virtual model of the comet and<br>we use this then for for planning our<br>navigation and our science of what we<br>want to see<br>and this is the power of the computing<br>that we can do today to actually do this<br>so<br>um then we start looking very carefully<br>to try and understand well look what are<br>some of these strange features well one<br>thing we noticed were these large<br>cylindrical holes that looked like a<br>well<br>that had been dug straight down into the<br>comet i think strange what on earth is<br>that so then we<br>did a bit more image processing and we<br>found out that here in the middle you<br>can see there is some venting going on<br>we realized that these were basically<br>vent holes<br>where the volatile chemistry inside the<br>comet when it gets close to the sun it<br>blasts out like a like a fire hose<br>so these are the active sites where the<br>venting that creates the tail of a comet<br>seems to be coming from<br>and again<br>we see another vent hole this time with<br>this sort of oozing remnant which is<br>basically it's a it's a molten gas<br>which came out as a as a gas at one<br>moment it then solidified into a liquid<br>and this and then it froze solid again<br>so this is like liquefied solidified<br>nitrous oxide for example which you'd<br>only ever see on a comet with a<br>temperature at about minus 90 degrees<br>which is the surface temperature which<br>we can see today<br>inside the comet it's minus 190 to minus<br>240 degrees<br>extremely cold inside<br>a bit warmer on the outside<br>looking sideways into one of these wells<br>i can't think of a better name we<br>noticed that what we call goosebumps on<br>the side looks like lots of little golf<br>balls on the surface and this seems to<br>be one of the<br>theories of how comets formed they're<br>formed by lots of little golf balls<br>sticking together and there's another<br>theory which is an aggregated layer<br>theory<br>but we saw both in fact so both both<br>theories are in fact correct<br>this is the layered theory by the way so<br>these are the layers and we had the golf<br>balls in the previous photo<br>so now we're getting into some of the<br>science results and i've have to cut<br>this short because uh i'm running a bit<br>out of time but we first thing we<br>discovered is the comet is very light<br>it has half the density of water so if<br>the comet was on on the sea it would<br>float<br>this is the thermal map showing the<br>temperatures so we've got minus 40 to<br>minus 70 as we're getting approaching<br>closer to the sun but minus 110 to minus<br>240 inside again so this is a thermal<br>image map taken by infrared spectroscopy<br>of the comet as it was rotating<br>underneath us<br>we collected some dust particles out<br>using the orbiter this is not on the<br>surface yet we dust is being blown off<br>and we could catch those and then we<br>analyze the dust particles or even if we<br>didn't get onto the surface we could<br>still analyze the material of the comet<br>and we blast this with an indian beam<br>and we can get a spectrum showing what<br>materials there are sodium magnesium and<br>all the what we call refactory elements<br>that go into making<br>the comet<br>and here we have the gas chromatography<br>this is showing the gases we found so<br>there's oxygen methane water vapor<br>carbon monoxide carbon dioxide<br>and then we do some mass spectroscopy<br>and this is where<br>some of the best instruments we have are<br>used and this is where we try to measure<br>molecules or the elements by their by<br>their mass okay so we've got here the<br>mass of carbon monoxide has 28 atomic<br>mass units we call it but so does<br>nitrogen and so it's silicon but because<br>of the spectral resolution we can split<br>the mass of these common mast<br>elements and molecules with enough<br>resolution to actually identify the<br>separate components of the separate<br>chemistry<br>even though they have almost the same<br>atomic mass and this is an incredible<br>instrument to get working half a billion<br>kilometers away from earth to do this<br>kind of measurement<br>and what did we find well we found a lot<br>of smelly disgusting chemicals<br>and we had acetylene alcohol ammonia<br>amino acids hydrogen sulfide methane<br>formaldehyde every single one of these<br>smells disgusting and that's<br>unfortunately the truth of the comet we<br>made the water<br>and the carbon chemistry that made us<br>all it's not like you know they say in<br>the nursery<br>girls are made of sugar and spice and<br>everything nice well it's not true we're<br>made of smelly comets okay<br>so<br>this is just to show you how dark the<br>comet is in relation to the imaging i<br>was telling you before so if we were a<br>million kilometers away from these four<br>bodies in space enceladus is one of the<br>moons of saturn and earth of course<br>we're very from earth in the moon this<br>is the relative brightness of a camera a<br>million kilometers away taking a photo<br>and of the comet 67p from the same<br>distance but that picture is a hundred<br>times brighter<br>and you can see we can still barely see<br>it here i don't know if you can see it<br>yeah um that's actually i've had to<br>magnify that 100 times in brightness to<br>even see it so just trying to give you<br>an idea of just how dark<br>and how small it's only four kilometers<br>long three kilometers high and two<br>kilometers wide i forgot to mention that<br>it's a very very very small object it's<br>very dark and it has no gravity<br>the it has gravity it has one hundred<br>thousandth of the gravity we have here<br>on earth<br>so everything about this object is small<br>and difficult to find so<br>so we've been in orbit and we then<br>started measuring what we call the<br>plasma field the plasma field is where<br>the evaporated material coming off the<br>comet gets ionized by the sun and it<br>gets modulated by the the solar wind<br>i won't go into the physics of that but<br>basically there's there's a gas coming<br>off the comet which is then activated by<br>the sun and it wobbles<br>with that's interesting we could see the<br>wobble on the on the electric<br>measurements we thought why don't we<br>speed those up and put them through a<br>speaker and try and listen to what the<br>comet's singing<br>or what it's trying to sing and tell us<br>so this is what this is what a comet<br>sounds like from half a billion<br>kilometers<br>now that is the sound of a comet believe<br>it or not obviously we can't hear it<br>it's in a hard vacuum but electrically<br>it's creating a signal<br>which we can amplify and measure and<br>convert into a sound<br>you hear the frequencies going up and<br>down there's all sorts of weird things<br>are going we don't know what they are<br>we've got no idea what's creating this<br>but the plasma consortium scientists<br>have gone berserk now trying to figure<br>out what on earth is this<br>because it's a very very interesting<br>signal<br>the comet's extremely cold it's<br>extremely far from the sun yet it's<br>incred in fact very active<br>and this is an unexpected<br>a very much unexpected event<br>so then we started looking for a landing<br>site and this is a difficult bit the<br>comet is incredibly rough and extremely<br>weird shape and we had to try to get our<br>lander which is very fragile onto an<br>almost zero g surface<br>and if we hit anything<br>it would tip over now as you can see i i<br>told you these are hot boulders they're<br>chunks of frozen ice or some other<br>volatile material we don't know quite<br>what it is yet<br>but we had this is the smoothest part we<br>could find and this was where we had to<br>get as much sunlight as we could<br>and a flat surface and also try to miss<br>the boulders well 50<br>of the best place we found was still<br>unsuitable but there was nothing else<br>and we carried the lander all this way<br>but we had to put it down so we decided<br>this is where we were going to do the<br>landing<br>so this is the landing sequence of what<br>we wanted to have happen<br>so this is a video generated by isis<br>showing<br>what we hoped was going to happen i<br>should say<br>so rosetta is flying over the comet at<br>about 18 centimeters per second<br>and the little andrew on the back gets<br>pushed off at exactly the same speed so<br>it's effectively stationary<br>above the comet so effectively<br>stationary and then we start drifting<br>down about one meter per second<br>from 22 kilometers high and it took<br>about seven hours to get down we open<br>the landing gear we open up the<br>instruments and the antennas<br>and we start drifting down towards the<br>surface<br>when we get down<br>we have two harpoons we want to fire and<br>to hold into<br>the comet surface<br>and<br>there they are the two red ones there<br>were meant to be the harpoons which were<br>going to fire<br>but they didn't<br>and i'll show you the consequence of<br>that<br>okay so this is so the real sequence<br>this is using our high resolution<br>science cameras to film filet as it was<br>going down onto the surface of the comet<br>in the background in that white square<br>is a full field view of the comet<br>can you see it<br>again i'm trying to emphasize how dark<br>the surface of the comet is because the<br>little lander was lit by the sun we were<br>interested in filming that there's no<br>way we could see the surface it was so<br>dark to analyze that we would have<br>washed out the lander so just again<br>trying to emphasize is how dark and how<br>difficult it is to even see the comet<br>so this is coming down<br>with the camera underneath the lander as<br>it's descending onto the surface and<br>this is part of the landing gear in the<br>field of view of the camera<br>we're coming down this is again 40<br>meters above the surface before our<br>first touchdown<br>and everything was looking good we got<br>to within half a meter of where we were<br>aiming from 22 kilometers away<br>this was an unprecedented result people<br>just couldn't believe how good this was<br>but unfortunately of course it was too<br>good we bounced off<br>we knew we hit the surface because those<br>microphones on the feet of the lander<br>which i mentioned to you before<br>we we heard them make the touchdown and<br>hello that was it that was a touchdown<br>okay but it was a positive signal<br>and we knew we'd hit something okay<br>okay so this is what we wanted we wanted<br>fillet on the nice flat surface in the<br>open sun analyzing a nice flat surface<br>we expected every image there are six<br>cameras around the edge of the lander<br>and we expect half to be<br>dark sky and have to be<br>some lit surface of comet so sky at the<br>top<br>land at the bottom<br>well this is what we got so this is i'll<br>get into that sorry<br>we realized something had gone wrong<br>when we were imaging the landing point<br>and all we could see was a puff of dust<br>so the green spot is where we were<br>aiming and this little light gray area<br>here this is the before and after of the<br>touchdown so this is before<br>and after and there was a dust cloud<br>good news we'd obviously hit somewhere<br>close to where we wanted but the lander<br>wasn't there<br>so i thought well where is the lander<br>well then there's another image about<br>the same time and one of the flight<br>dynamics people realized that in this<br>image we could also see the little<br>lander this is from 22 kilometers above<br>looking down for a half meter height<br>sized<br>box of electronics for the lender and we<br>could see one pixel which was the actual<br>lander and its shadow on the surface as<br>it drifted away after it bounced off<br>and so this is an incredible image to<br>get this again<br>keep on emphasizing how dark it is<br>and how far away but to get this kind of<br>image is just unprecedented in space<br>exploration history<br>so we realized that instead of landing<br>here which is the area we wanted we'd<br>landed over here in this very rough very<br>dark<br>craggy surface<br>and again this is another image showing<br>the descent<br>of the filet down to the surface looking<br>down from rosetta we can see a series of<br>these four images here as we're coming<br>in this was the area we wanted to land<br>this is before image and the after where<br>we can see the three little foot pads<br>which had left an impression but no<br>lander at that same time at 15<br>43 we were looking around here to see<br>could we see the lander and there it was<br>over right over here on the right hand<br>side in the dark<br>in fact it was still drifting we could<br>see the little lander as it was about to<br>leave the field of view of our camera<br>looking down<br>so it did land eventually after one hour<br>and 50 minutes it did actually stop<br>bouncing around and it came down<br>and<br>we started processing the six<br>panoramic images and this is what we saw<br>so this is camera number one it was<br>extremely dark and we realized well this<br>is this is really unexpected we wanted<br>to be in the nice sunny plane<br>but we could see a dark wall and the top<br>half was not dark space and the bottom<br>half was not nice sunday land it was<br>something very strange<br>camera number two was looking straight<br>out into space<br>that's strange how on earth can that<br>happen so<br>dark space this is one of the antennas<br>of one of the instruments so it was a<br>valid image but it was not seeing<br>landscape<br>then camera number three we could see<br>some sunlit surface again but again on<br>its side or something strange camera<br>number four again sunlit looking<br>promising<br>five very dark<br>six very dark<br>so we thought well what is all this<br>telling us well we did some processing<br>and we put the best images together<br>three and four<br>and we got this sort of looked like the<br>wall of a cliff face a wall of a crevice<br>sunlit with the lander leg here in the<br>foreground<br>then we added the colour and put some<br>depth of field cues in and we realized<br>that we're actually we really were<br>caught in some kind of a crevice<br>and this it's not a very good image i'm<br>sorry but this little blue cube here<br>this is the actual lander with its legs<br>tilted on its side and we realized that<br>we bounced into a small crevice and<br>tipped over on our side we could still<br>do science there was no problem we<br>managed to get a full set of<br>measurements which is still being<br>processed and we are now waiting for<br>reactivation which we think will be in<br>july or august of this year when the sun<br>will be coming down onto one of these<br>solar panels with enough sunlight with<br>enough strength to actually turn the<br>lander back on again after the first<br>three days of science which we did when<br>we first landed<br>using a non-rechargeable battery we did<br>a full suite of science in this position<br>and then we hope to do another phase<br>when we get closer to the sun<br>so that's the end of the presentation<br>but i do just to answer this one<br>question i get a lot of people that ask<br>me how on earth did i get to work on<br>this project<br>okay so this is most important question<br>to answer<br>be a very ordinary student okay but<br>be committed determined and hardworking<br>i was a very ordinary student<br>and but i really really really wanted to<br>work in space i saw neil armstrong<br>walking down the ladder on the apollo 11<br>when i was in grade two in adelaide i<br>was eight years old<br>and from that day i was crazy about<br>space<br>but i was just really an ordinary<br>student<br>but i knew i had to study science<br>technology engineering and mathematics<br>subjects<br>and that's what what cartoon now is<br>focusing on and<br>you need to have a really good teacher<br>and i did have the best i'm i'm<br>absolutely convinced the best electrical<br>engineering lecturer of all the people<br>i've ever worked with in europe and<br>that's what professor jonathan scott<br>down here okay where does professor<br>and you have to get into a good<br>university and that's waikato so<br>professor scott is working at waikato<br>university and they have an emphasis on<br>stem subjects and that's all you need so<br>if there's anybody here in this audience<br>who's an average student and wants to do<br>this kind of work there's no excuse it's<br>all here for you<br>i want to thank these people who helped<br>organize the talk i have to do this for<br>legal reasons these are all the credits<br>for all the images from the scientific<br>institutes<br>we have a few moments for some questions<br>before we have to proceed out into the<br>foyer so if we could have some questions<br>from the audience please if before you<br>speak if you could identify who you are<br>is it just one microphone or marvelous<br>marvelous thank you um<br>i wish i was 23 years old and just<br>starting and i do exactly what you said<br>the orbit of the rosetta around the<br>comet obvious very low gravity very slow<br>speed everything happening very slowly<br>is it a stable audit or orbit or is it<br>requiring continuous<br>orbital adjustments to maintain its<br>position with<br>relation to the asteroid what a<br>fantastic question you need to come and<br>work with lisa okay<br>that is actually one of our biggest<br>problems was to know how close do we<br>have to get to be able to close the<br>orbit we had no idea we had no idea how<br>heavy the comet was we didn't know<br>anything about the shape the shape was a<br>complete surprise it turns out<br>we had to get within 30 kilometers to<br>close the orbit we did a series of<br>triangles coming in in front of the<br>comet so the sun was over there the<br>comet's here and we did a series of<br>triangles like a pyramid and we got<br>slightly closer and smaller and smaller<br>until they started to bend<br>and they started to bend we realized<br>well there is a gravity on this thing<br>it's extremely small 100 000th of a g<br>but as we got closer and closer we got<br>to 30 kilometers to realize if we slow<br>down<br>to what is it i think it's 10<br>centimeters per second<br>we can close the orbit and then we got<br>down to 20 we got down to 10 i think<br>it's 10<br>kilometers above the orbit something<br>like 18 centimeters per second it's<br>ridiculously slow but one kilometer an<br>hour<br>but that's was enough to do a circular<br>orbit and then we round what we call the<br>terminator so with comets turning<br>underneath us<br>we're 10 kilometers and it's great for<br>getting imagery too so we've got these<br>very powerful cameras and we're scanning<br>right down to centimeter size<br>pieces of ice not rocks<br>and um so that's the big unknown we had<br>no idea<br>how close we had to get before we could<br>close the orbit luckily it all turned<br>out well we were close enough without<br>getting blown away by the gas and dust<br>evaporating because we got there before<br>it was activated so we've scanned it<br>like crazy now we have to move up to<br>about 200 kilometers away because<br>there's simply way too much dust and<br>it's blinding our star tracker you know<br>that star trek image where i showed you<br>you couldn't see<br>the stars well that that we actually had<br>a serious event about a week ago where<br>it got blinded and we lost navigation<br>for a few minutes<br>and we went to what we call the safe<br>mode first time it ever happened so we<br>recovered from that and we realized we<br>have to get further away<br>but luckily we got science for<br>six months very close we go further away<br>during the active phase and then we come<br>hi i was just wondering is there any<br>particular reason this comment was<br>chosen versus<br>any other in a comparable<br>good question um you know the problem is<br>catching a comet you know all comets by<br>definition are normally outside the<br>orbit of pluto i mean there's a place<br>called the kuiper belt which is outside<br>of pluto and much further out there's a<br>sphere called the oort cloud which is a<br>hundred thousand times further than the<br>earth to the sun 100 000 iu they call it<br>there's a reservoir great big sphere of<br>billions and billions and billions of<br>comets which are very far out<br>the only reason we can catch this one is<br>because<br>one of those comets got disturbed at<br>some stage by a collision or an<br>interaction even with a passing star<br>the comet came in went around the sun<br>but jupiter was luckily in the right<br>position to catch it<br>you need two bodies to catch a comet one<br>it just curves in and goes straight back<br>out to where it started it's what we'll<br>call a single focus with a double focus<br>body you can catch the comet and you<br>reduce the size of the orbit enormously<br>they're called jupiter family comets<br>there's about 500 of them but only 22 of<br>them are actually close enough that we<br>can catch with an ariane 5 full power<br>and 10 years of gravity assist<br>so we had very limited options and this<br>was just turned out for a series of<br>different reasons of those 22 that was<br>when you land rosetta on the comet<br>will that extra mass<br>change the orbit of the comet in any way<br>oh great question okay um<br>rosetta weighs three tons fully fueled<br>1.7 tonnes is fuel which will be<br>exhausted so we're about down to about<br>1.3 tons<br>even though the comet is four by three<br>by two kilometers roughly it's a very<br>strange shape it actually weighs 10<br>trillion tons<br>okay but that believe it or not is<br>nothing in the mass of solar system<br>bodies i mean what's the mass of the<br>mass of the earth's if 10 with 31 zeroes<br>after it in kilograms okay so it's<br>incomparable in terms of the earth but<br>it's it's still massive in terms of<br>of<br>um the comet what you've got to<br>understand is that the comet is<br>evaporating hundreds of tons of material<br>every time we go past<br>the sun<br>so about five to twenty meters of the<br>layer of the outer layer<br>of 67p will disappear in this what we<br>call perihelion passage it's a six and a<br>half year orbit when we come back in<br>again we're going to lose another 20<br>meters i forget how many times i've<br>calculated how many tons that is but<br>it's several you know thousands of tons<br>um the comet's going to be around<br>forever because even though it's<br>evaporating and the volatile material is<br>coming off<br>there's um refractory material which<br>doesn't evaporate and that's that<br>motorcycle meteorite which is like a<br>black rock<br>well that will be left over one day too<br>as all the non-volatile stuff compresses<br>into former rock<br>there will be just a rocky inert core<br>left and all the volatile stuff is gone<br>but in terms of mass ratio it's almost<br>insignificant and whatever we add is<br>going to be evaporated off the next time<br>could you talk a little bit more about<br>the internal structure you've got your<br>goosebumps about three meters across i<br>understand are they a bit like<br>chondrites in meteorites and do they<br>predate the the banding what's the<br>sequence of events do you think well<br>that's what we don't know i mean we're<br>trying to we've seen for the first time<br>ever evidence of the internal structure<br>so we've got lucky we've got this<br>feature which is a well and we can see<br>on the wall of the world there are there<br>are golf ball sides they're golf ball<br>size they're not quantity's about the<br>size of grains of rice<br>krondites from meteorites are<br>quantitative meteorites some have also<br>undergone heating<br>and the comet hasn't undergone heating<br>by definition it's a primordial frozen<br>body so it's a different chemistry a<br>different formation process we thought<br>there were little golf balls that made<br>the goose bumps but then we also saw<br>layering so when the comet was first<br>being made you know four and a half<br>billion years ago and more<br>it was flying through these huge clouds<br>of dust which was slowly collapsing<br>under gravity into a big disk they call<br>it the accretion disk and we were flying<br>through clouds of dust of elements and<br>strange carbon chemistry and forming<br>layers so there is sort of this onion<br>layer process to make the comet<br>originally<br>billions of years ago<br>where the little golf ball goosebumps<br>come from nobody knows it is actually a<br>theory there's something to do with the<br>electrostatic charge of<br>dust over a certain distance blah blah<br>blah i don't know what that is<br>but both theories seem to be correct so<br>there were golf balls drifting around<br>there and layers of gas clouds they both<br>seem to have been responsible for making<br>the structure but they're not<br>quantitative little cronulls from from<br>meteorites<br>because there's different chemistries do<br>you all ever consider that the mass<br>signatures that you're looking at in the<br>mass spectroscopy might not be silicon<br>or co or nitrogen because you can see<br>different amino acids that we wouldn't<br>have here otherwise but these are<br>something completely new right great<br>chris okay that's good um<br>we are still limited to the fundamentals<br>of elements okay so we have the same<br>elements and we have we're assuming the<br>same isotopes because in everything<br>we've ever seen in all of our<br>interplanetary science<br>the elements are the same and the<br>isotope ratios are not necessarily the<br>same they're different for different<br>reasons but they're the same isotopes we<br>might get more exotic isotopes naturally<br>going we haven't seen on earth or maybe<br>on some other planets but we in the lab<br>we know what isotopes exist and we know<br>what to look for so outside of any<br>unknown isotope so i don't think we're<br>going to see anything unusual we'll<br>certainly see strange combinations and<br>we're seeing that right now<br>as far as the amino acids are concerned<br>um yes we're seeing certainly amino<br>acids which do not exist on earth and<br>theoretically i think there's something<br>like 500 potential amino acids you can<br>make just with the definition of what an<br>amino acid is what is really unusual and<br>i didn't say this because i was limited<br>for time<br>is we have seen the big unusual thing<br>with life is all the biogenic carbon<br>chemistry that makes us<br>is based on a chirality of carbon<br>chemistry we are left-handed or<br>right-handed chemistry not left-handed<br>humans but left-handed shaped molecules<br>with the same elements<br>as right-handed shaped molecules so<br>we've got the left-hand hand we've both<br>got<br>four fingers on each hand but the thumbs<br>are on different sides<br>okay human life is based on left-handed<br>shaped molecules of chiral chemistry why<br>left<br>when the process is on earth that form<br>amino acids actually create the miller<br>urae experiment made equal numbers of<br>left and right handed<br>that doesn't explain where human life<br>started<br>we looked on murchison we found an 18<br>excess of left-handed<br>chiral chemistry amino acids so we're<br>looking now to see if we can find again<br>left-handed amino acids and that<br>explains that the bombardment of combats<br>on the earth not only brought water<br>not only brought amino acids but bought<br>left-handed amino acids and it's all too<br>incredible for words<br>you and i are made from a comet this is<br>yes hi there mark from kiwispace uh just<br>the question at the end of the mission<br>uh when rosetta you spiral rosetta down<br>and touch down again are you<br>anticipating still being able to<br>continue science at that point well<br>i think we can um we're going to be very<br>limited because<br>you know rosetta was never designed to<br>go onto the surface of the comet it's<br>actually got by far the best mass<br>spectrometer and the best instruments<br>are actually on rosetta i will be<br>turning solar panels so they will be<br>facing out<br>we do know they'll be rotating every 12<br>hours so we're expecting to get sunlight<br>a lot of sunlight<br>onto the lander when we first come down<br>now as we go out we're going to have the<br>same problems why we had to go into<br>hibernation and that is we are just<br>going to one day get too far away that<br>even the big solar panels of rosetta<br>won't have enough power but i'm certain<br>that in those first few months after<br>we've come onto the surface that we will<br>be able to do science with those<br>instruments on on rosetta for sure pearl<br>orlando will have been long dead because<br>it's it's in a crevice and it's hidden<br>away we will be able to bring down<br>rosetta anywhere we want that the<br>navigation of that big orbiter is just<br>incredible we can get to within<br>millimeters with where we want to get<br>with that we can bring it down we've got<br>24 thrusters to bring it down incredibly<br>slowly we can do the softest landing you<br>can imagine in a sense the lander would<br>have been a better lander than sorry the<br>orbiter would have been a better lander<br>than the lander<br>but it will get down and we're almost<br>certain that it will stay on now whether<br>or not we can get meaningful science out<br>of those instruments we don't really<br>know they haven't actually wasted time<br>planning that yet<br>we're still busy doing all the science<br>we can<br>in orbit but they they will certainly<br>plan and do some some incredible thing<br>this is what i love about these three is<br>they can do the most incredible things<br>when they you don't expect it<br>even getting to this thing was<br>incredible the first time ever in the<br>history of man of human humanity that<br>they've got to a comet on the first<br>attempt orbited and landed they've been<br>51 missions to mars starting in 1960<br>with the russians only 42 of them have<br>succeeded now mars is a huge planet a<br>huge gravity it's got an atmosphere to<br>slow down in to do a landing you know we<br>know the orbit of mars better than the<br>back of our hand<br>this comet has been passed us on eight<br>times<br>and we can barely see the thing as i<br>keep telling you to go into orbit around<br>that and land on it with a body with no<br>gravity completely black with no<br>atmosphere i still can't believe it<br>i'm just waiting for the conspiracy<br>theories that the whole thing was done<br>hello warwick i'm brian so where are you<br>brandon<br>i hear that you mentioned that new<br>zealand should join the european space<br>agency and i wondered if it is a club<br>that we could join i noticed that you<br>mentioned that project was 2 billion<br>over 11 years<br>a little over 200 million a year<br>what if we did join what would that cost<br>new zealand<br>well that's a that's another really good<br>question um<br>i really use that argument for trying to<br>make australia join because i'm<br>australian but it does apply to new<br>zealand as well<br>you can become an associate member of<br>isa very easily canada is an associate<br>member of visa and has been for 40 years<br>the<br>formula for joining ether is i think is<br>about point zero five percent of the gdp<br>of any european or associate country is<br>what the contribution is i calculate it<br>for different reasons but that's about<br>the figure which means i think in new<br>zealand terms it's about eight to ten<br>million dollars a year<br>new zealand could be an associate member<br>visa and do missions like this now the<br>way it works is that if you become an<br>associate or member of visa<br>you get what they call geographic return<br>and they guarantee every dollar you put<br>in you will get that dollar spent back<br>in your country in some industry<br>somewhere here in new zealand<br>the canadians have been looking at this<br>very carefully to think well is it<br>really why are we members of lisa why is<br>canada an associate member of lisa when<br>they've got nasa right next door it<br>turns out that for every dollar they<br>invest<br>three different universities have<br>calculated they get 3.50 back in profit<br>and that means that esa gives you money<br>you you gain profit when you join esa in<br>terms of technology in terms of selling<br>high-tech with those companies which<br>then are spin-offs i guess you could say<br>and so for australia it's about 15<br>million a year which is really nothing<br>when we spend australia 30 billion in<br>our defense budget we paid for the<br>entire 25-year rosetta mission<br>in three weeks<br>in our military budget in australia<br>two billion dollars in three weeks<br>is it 25 years and look look at the<br>results we got so it's just a bit<br>frustrating because i've had to work for<br>20 29 years away from australia<br>doing this work to do it<br>and for me the question is why australia<br>is is one of the members of the oecd<br>35 countries and we're the only country<br>that doesn't have a space agency<br>even vietnam has a space agency they<br>build their own spacecraft i'm not<br>meaning in a patronizing sense but why<br>is australia not<br>doesn't it have its own federally<br>mandated space agency and i don't think<br>new zealand does either i'm not for sure<br>hi<br>how long will the landers stay on the<br>comet will it be a human landmark like<br>the moonland or will it get shot off<br>i'm sorry i couldn't hear that how long<br>will the the lander remain on the comet<br>will it be a human landmark like the<br>moon lander will get shot off<br>the the markings on where the touchdown<br>was they they will certainly evaporate<br>away at some stage but as i said as as<br>the volatile components of the comet<br>evaporate after millions of years of<br>going past the sun<br>um the non-volatile parts of the comet<br>the metals and some of the refractory<br>molecules will mean that there's a rock<br>basically a gooey black rock<br>will be left over and the orbiter and<br>the lander will still be stuck on that<br>rock because the<br>the gas pressure even evaporating right<br>underneath the lander is nowhere near<br>enough to blow it off we need an escape<br>velocity of one meter per second<br>to bounce to leave the surface of the<br>comet and there's no way that the<br>pressure of an evaporating molecules<br>underneath the lander can do that so we<br>are we are definitely on the surface for<br>the rest of the life of the of the comet<br>or of the solar system i guess um and<br>they'll be remnants of human exploration<br>for the rest of the life of the solar<br>system<br>i think we have time for one last<br>question<br>yes<br>um so one of the benefits of space<br>exploration is um kind of collateral<br>benefit like you develop new<br>technologies which can be used<br>in all sorts of other places so what<br>would you say the biggest<br>breakthrough that came from this mission<br>was<br>good question um<br>it's difficult to<br>look at these scientific missions and<br>say directly because we measured an<br>amino acid on a comet half a billion<br>kilometers away what direct effect does<br>it have well one of the effects you<br>could say is we've made mass<br>spectrometers which can fit into a shoe<br>box<br>and they can be sent to africa<br>you know it's mass spectrometer used to<br>be something that filled a room okay<br>well we were determined to get something<br>the size of a shoebox to land on the<br>comet so that technology was<br>you know for benefit of mankind it's a<br>bit indirect but definitely we have<br>miniaturized mass spectrometry gas<br>chromatography<br>but<br>esa have got just books and books and<br>books of the benefits from you know gps<br>people thought when we first put our<br>first atomic clocks into space we wanted<br>to measure the einstein effect and that<br>was the<br>change in the frequency as we went<br>through gravitational field<br>people thinking why are you doing that<br>what a ridiculously stupid thing to do<br>well today we have gps and that's a<br>constellation of 32 atomic clocks used<br>to tell you where you are in your car<br>and does anybody think gps is worth it<br>okay so with all of these benefits<br>anything to do in space with remote<br>sensing looking at the huge storm that<br>hit sydney while i've been away thank<br>god<br>um we could see that thing coming for<br>miles you know and everybody could<br>button down and get ready well that's<br>again because of remote sensing looking<br>down<br>so when we put our first cameras in<br>space people thought you know why are<br>you doing that why do you want to take<br>we know what clouds look like well look<br>what we can do today with infrared<br>spectroscopy we can look at the velocity<br>of the clouds and where they're coming<br>from in three dimensions right through<br>the clouds<br>so<br>at the beginning it doesn't seem obvious<br>you know what what are we doing this for<br>but later on incredible things come out<br>and that's that's the best answer i can<br>give but i guarantee you<br>out of rosetta there will be some huge<br>benefit for humanity<br>right i'm going to call the proceedings<br>to an end right now but before that<br>before we go out to the foyer um for<br>those who wish to ask jonathan which<br>courses they can enroll in next year<br>and those who wish to ask um if there's<br>a job available as well in europe um i'd<br>like to thank you and some gifts from<br>the university thank you very much thank<br>you very much i'm hoping it's our<br>subscription to the space<br>agency yes<br>and please join me in a round of<br>and hopefully we will continue our<br>conversations outside in the foyer thank<br>you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
