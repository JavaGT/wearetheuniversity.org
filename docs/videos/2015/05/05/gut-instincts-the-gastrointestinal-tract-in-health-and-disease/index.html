gentlemen<br>my name is peter joyce i'm dean<br>university of otago christchurch<br>and it's my pleasure to introduce the<br>first of our six<br>public health lectures for 2015.<br>with some of our public health lectures<br>they all are also inaugural professorial<br>lectures<br>which are ancient university traditions<br>um<br>that when the university appoint or<br>promote people to professor they give a<br>lecture on the topic of their research<br>for all to hear<br>and in christchurch we have the<br>tradition of combining it with these<br>public health health health lectures<br>so it's my pleasure tonight to introduce<br>professor richard geary who was promoted<br>by the university the decision was made<br>at the end of last year and took effect<br>from the first of february this year<br>and<br>to introduce richard for both these<br>talks um<br>now richard<br>is a university of otago graduate and in<br>fact did his advanced learning in<br>medicine on the christchurch campus<br>physician in christchurch barry coles<br>who may or may not be known to people<br>from the past who was renowned for being<br>a stickler for uh terrifying students<br>and he said in the first 25 years of the<br>school richard was one of the two best<br>medical students who ever trained<br>through christchurch<br>and barry doesn't usually give praise<br>out lightly<br>so after his uh training as a physician<br>in christchurch and a short while in<br>melbourne completed a phd as a registrar<br>was appointed to our staff in 2007 with<br>a joint appointment with the canterbury<br>district health board as a<br>gastroenterologist<br>and within a very short period of time<br>he has been promoted to associate<br>professor and professor<br>which is thoroughly deserved so it's my<br>pleasure to introduce richard tonight to<br>talk about gut instincts the human gi<br>thank you peter for that very kind<br>introduction um<br>when i was asked to give an inaugural<br>professor or lecture i was<br>obviously<br>felt very uh very good about that and it<br>was something i feel quite humble about<br>as well and i was talking to one of my<br>colleagues uh richard trout and he goes<br>what are you going to do for the ipl<br>i thought ipl fantastic<br>many of you many of you know me will<br>know that i'm that i love cricket um<br>unfortunately my cricketing prowess and<br>uh our family stopped just before it got<br>to my generation with my father and<br>grandfather being fantastic cricketers<br>but<br>even though i'm not going to be part of<br>the ipl as you know it this is the ipl<br>as i know it and hopefully you'll get<br>some enjoyment tonight<br>so i'd like to do is take you on a<br>fantastic voyage through the<br>gastrointestinal tract from one end to<br>the other and along the way i want to<br>point out some things of interest i want<br>this to be a celebration of gut research<br>that goes on in christchurch so not just<br>about what i've done but what other<br>people in our department have done as<br>well<br>i want to take some look at some<br>research highlights and and find out<br>where we're going to from here<br>so this is the movie the fantastic<br>voyage starring raquel welsh who some of<br>you will know and stephen boyd as well<br>and in this movie uh the the spaceship<br>went through the gastrointestinal it<br>went through the body firing at aliens<br>and other things along the way we might<br>won't have any firing of guns in here<br>but hopefully we'll take a trip in a<br>similar way to the people on this on<br>this voyage<br>so as a gastroenterologist it can be<br>interesting when you go to parties and<br>people ask you what you do and you say<br>you're a gastroenterologist and people<br>think that that's what you do all day<br>and while that's what i do some of the<br>time it's certainly not what i do all<br>the time and i think as a<br>gastroenterologist and as a group of<br>physicians who work as guests in georgia<br>i think we're in a very previous<br>privileged position<br>all doctors are in a privileged<br>privileged position in that we get to<br>hear<br>a lot of very intimate details about<br>people they can find in us they trust us<br>and as a gastroenterologist we hear that<br>but we also examine them not just on the<br>outside but on the inside as well and<br>that ability to do that i think means<br>that we have a very close connection<br>with our patients not just physically<br>but also in the relationships that we<br>have with them from a therapeutic point<br>of view and by doing endoscopy we're<br>able to identify many different diseases<br>from throughout the gastrointestinal<br>tract be that inflammation ulceration<br>dysplasia neoplasia or cancer but also<br>worms as you can see in the bottom there<br>so to start on our fantastic voyage to<br>the gastrointestinal tract what i'd like<br>to do is use one of these things here<br>which is a pill cam or capsule endoscopy<br>now the reason i'm going to use that to<br>start with is that this is a new<br>technology we're not so new now where<br>you swallow this and it takes<br>photographs as it goes through your<br>gastrointestinal tract so we can<br>actually go on a voyage through the<br>gastrointestinal tract using one of<br>these and showing the footage<br>paul you're all good at catching so i'm<br>going to throw that to you and you can<br>pass it around the crowd if you like<br>so um you'll be pleased to know paul<br>okay so this is uh this is the study of<br>someone swallowing a pill a pill cam so<br>you can see the people who are watching<br>in the background there's daylight nurse<br>about to give it to them and here it<br>goes down it's in the tongue it's over<br>the tongue it's in their mouth it's<br>going around at the moment they're<br>having trouble swelling it's quite big<br>is it going to go down here it goes here<br>it goes there it goes down the esophagus<br>into the stomach<br>and there it arrives in the stomach<br>there and this is the sort of technology<br>that we have now with um with<br>gastroenterology to be able to do that<br>and in fact it was the bell and liver<br>trust which i'll talk about later that<br>raised the money for the first one of<br>these to be available in a public<br>so here's the gastrointestinal tract<br>this is my part of the world when i come<br>to work this is what i do and we're<br>going to start up at the top of the<br>esophagus which is how we get food<br>from our mouth to our stomach it's the<br>highway for getting things in and<br>essentially there are these peristaltic<br>waves of contraction that push<br>food and fluid down the esophagus into<br>the stomach and many of you may be aware<br>of the illnesses that can affect the<br>esophagus such as gastroesophageal<br>reflux disease or esophageal cancer and<br>reflux is really very very common and as<br>we all get a bit bigger around here<br>myself included more pressure is being<br>put in our stomach pushing the contents<br>back up into the esophagus and causing<br>this burning or women i overeat or<br>overindulge and certainly the ability to<br>treat this now with medications and<br>surgery has improved over the years<br>moving on quickly from the esophagus we<br>have the stomach here and i think the<br>stomach's a fantastic organ it's a<br>liquidizer so you know your food<br>processor the bit you put on top and you<br>push the button and buzz it it takes the<br>solid food and fluid and turns that up<br>together to make this lovely stuff<br>that's left it's called chyme and that's<br>what leaves your stomach and goes into<br>the rest of your gastrointestinal tract<br>so the stomach is a great big liquidizer<br>and the sorts of diseases that can<br>affect the stomach include peptic ulcer<br>disease or stomach ulcers which are<br>often caused by helicobacter pylori and<br>gastric cancer<br>and here we can see<br>warren and marshall you'll see them<br>doing a high five i think it's slightly<br>better than the high five that richie<br>mccoy and stephen fleming missed on the<br>opening night of the world cup but they<br>were doing that because they won the<br>nobel prize for discovering by infecting<br>themself with this bacteria that it<br>actually causes stomach ulcers and by<br>doing that they were able to then come<br>up with treatments for stomach ulcers<br>that allowed people to<br>essentially survive when they presented<br>very unwell and prevented that happening<br>and we've got local researchers<br>including dr jackie keenan who've made<br>tremendous work done tremendous work on<br>helicobacter pylori and jackie has also<br>done great work and the way that bugs in<br>the gut interact with the with the<br>gastrointestinal system we're going to<br>talk a lot about that tonight<br>so you might ask well how do you look at<br>the gastrointestinal system how do you<br>do your job<br>so just to make it a little bit more<br>obvious about what we do i thought i'd<br>bring a long scope<br>and certainly you're all welcome at the<br>end to come and play with this if you<br>want i have washed it<br>so it is a it is a clean one<br>and you can see here that by using this<br>sort of instrument we're able to steer<br>and look around by moving up and down<br>left and right and we can put biopsy<br>forceps and other things through the<br>scope to enable us to take biopsies and<br>do other things as well so this is old<br>gastroenterology technology if you like<br>but something that we use on a routine<br>basis<br>this is a gastric ulcer i'm going to<br>show you this movie we're very lucky on<br>the net if you want to ever look at an<br>endoscopic image of something dr murrah<br>from el salvador has put just about<br>every endoscopy he's ever done online so<br>you can see someone with this enormous<br>gastric ulcer for example which could<br>easily bleed large amounts of blood into<br>the gastrointestinal tract or it could<br>burrow through the wall of the bowel and<br>perforate causing problems as well and<br>dr murrah is very brave putting his<br>scope quite so far into the ulster i'm<br>not sure many of the local<br>gastroenterologists would do that but he<br>wanted to get the right shot and he was<br>available able to do that quite easily<br>by by doing that<br>so that's uh that's a gastrointestinal<br>system how do we treat that sort of<br>thing well we can inject it by putting<br>adrenaline and around that if it's<br>bleeding or we can even put clips<br>through the scope and clip a blood<br>vessel on the end which enables us to<br>stop bleeding and improve outcomes for<br>patients<br>so moving on from the stomach to my<br>probably my favorite organ in the body<br>just just my favorite and that's the<br>small intestine which i think is a is<br>really a wonderful thing it's where<br>digestion happens it's where that food<br>that you had for lunch for dinner<br>what you've had to drink finally gets<br>absorbed into the body and has an effect<br>on people interestingly nine liters a<br>day of fluid are secreted into the small<br>bowel to enable you to do that so it's a<br>very complex environment of what's<br>what's going on there and the sorts of<br>diseases that can affect people in the<br>small intestine include celiac disease<br>and crohn's disease<br>so celiac disease many of you will be<br>aware of us to do with gluten and<br>interestingly the small bowel was<br>normally 20 feet long approximately but<br>it's got a surface area the size of a<br>tennis court that's because of these<br>micro villa and these villi which<br>project like this increasing the surface<br>area allowing food to be absorbed and<br>nutrients to be absorbed into the into<br>the intestine but in celiac disease<br>you'll see that these long villi that<br>are here have now gone and you're left<br>with this flattened mucosa and these<br>long crips meaning that food can't be<br>absorbed as well and people can often<br>have symptoms and these symptoms can<br>include diarrhea pain and bloating but<br>some people have no symptoms whatsoever<br>but still can get complications<br>um in christ christchurch has been<br>research done suggesting about 185 or so<br>people have<br>celiac disease and that was one of the<br>first studies that really made it clear<br>how common celiac disease was and they<br>did the study by taking random people<br>who were allowed who wanted to come in<br>selected off the electoral role and for<br>free they got testing for a number of<br>things done and we came up with the<br>background rates of how common these<br>diseases were and some of the people who<br>were involved in that research in<br>particular and celiac disease in<br>particular is dr cook uh who bramble<br>cook who um who's been retired for a<br>while now you can read about bramble in<br>the newsletter that's in front of you<br>there about how he's a trustee as well<br>and also andrew day i think he's done<br>some really interesting work on celiac<br>disease and the pediatric population if<br>you want to know more about celiac<br>diseases people from the celiac society<br>outside today and they can give you some<br>more information as well<br>so<br>before we get on to my second favorite<br>organ i have to talk about the liver<br>because my colleagues do tell me that it<br>is part of the gastrointestinal tract<br>even though i tend not to look after<br>people with problems from that organ<br>quite so often the liver they tell me is<br>important i do believe them it is a very<br>important organ in the body and it can<br>be affected by many different diseases<br>as you can see here that affect people<br>in different ways and in christchurch<br>we've been i think blessed with a an<br>amazing group of liver researchers and i<br>think they've gone under the radar in<br>many ways their their outputs have been<br>amazing we've got robin fraser who is<br>well known for his work on the liver civ<br>and really internationally renowned for<br>that bruce chapman not just with<br>hepatitis but many other liver diseases<br>and diseases as well geoffrey knew at<br>the top there who's recently done a phd<br>and has been headhunted over to<br>singapore where he's working at the<br>moment michael burt done great work on<br>hemochromatosis while he was overseas<br>and catherine stedman who amazingly has<br>just been involved in new treatments to<br>cure hepatitis c and again if you want<br>to read about that in more detail it's<br>in the newsletter in front of you<br>liver disease is a big deal because if<br>you don't catch liver disease early it<br>can progress to cirrhosis and you can<br>see this nodular liver on the on the on<br>the right<br>and the complications of cirrhosis<br>include<br>liver cancer and also liver failure and<br>while liver transplant is an option<br>there aren't many livers about<br>there's a shortage and people die on the<br>waiting list waiting for liver<br>transplant and some people aren't<br>suitable<br>the pancreas is also important as well<br>and just to mention two great<br>researchers locally saxon connor and<br>medivh bhatia who who work in that area<br>as well so there's a great depth of gut<br>research going on in christchurch<br>so now we can move on to my second<br>favorite organ in the body the colon i<br>knew you were waiting for the spit it's<br>the exciting bit so this is where<br>absorption of water and salts occur and<br>your colon is really important because<br>it allows you to actually not have to do<br>a poo every two minutes you can actually<br>delay having a poo which means that you<br>can get on and do other things in your<br>life that are as important as that<br>the sorts of diseases that affect the<br>colon can include ulcerative colitis<br>colorectal cancer and diverticular<br>disease<br>this is these are polyps which some of<br>you may have heard of and as a<br>gastroenterologist there are many things<br>that make us happy in life but finding<br>polyps is one of the true joys that we<br>have because if we find a polyp we can<br>remove it and if we remove it we may be<br>able to prevent bowel cancer and again<br>that makes us very happy and content in<br>our jobs and and<br>and<br>enjoy enjoy life<br>as you can see here there's this thing<br>called the polyp cancer sequence where<br>people start with a polyp and end up<br>having cancer further down the track so<br>if we can intervene back here and remove<br>the polyps then maybe we can prevent<br>cancer and here you can see how we can<br>use a snare over the top of a polyp to<br>remove it from the bowel and that<br>prevents bowel cancer which is what's<br>going on here<br>the way we do that is with colonoscopy<br>which is very similar to this instrument<br>here but you'll be pleased to know it's<br>a different instrument we don't use the<br>same one for both things<br>bowel cancer is a really big deal in new<br>zealand a really big deal you can see<br>here that the rate of bowel cancer<br>increases with age and over two and a<br>half thousand people are diagnosed each<br>year about 50 people are diagnosed each<br>week in new zealand with bowel cancer<br>and while we really enjoy beating<br>australia at rugby union rugby league<br>cricket this weekend it's not so good to<br>beat them when it comes to the frequency<br>of bowel cancer and the mortality from<br>bowel cancer i'm very happy to let them<br>win that one and we need to do more<br>about this we need to have more<br>knowledge about what's going on we need<br>to be able to have better methods of<br>detecting bowel cancer easily perhaps<br>not with colonoscopy but perhaps with<br>other other things by doing that<br>and then in christchurch again there are<br>many researchers who are working on<br>bowel cancer jackie again chris wakeman<br>tim mington frank frazelle people in the<br>cancer group who work together to work<br>on bowel cancer<br>so getting back to life as a<br>gastroenterologist and some of the<br>things that that i do<br>i do endoscopy but i do other things as<br>well but i must say<br>while we like finding polyps it also<br>puts a spring in our step and joy in our<br>heart to see a normal colon<br>this is a normal colon you can see it's<br>healthy you can see the capillaries<br>across the wall of the bowel that<br>glistening appearance it's a beautiful<br>thing ladies and gentlemen a beautiful<br>thing<br>it's also beautiful when there's a<br>lovely prep like this as opposed to a<br>poor bell prep and we get to see lots of<br>but the gut is an amazing amazing part<br>of the body and the colon's amazing part<br>of the body because it is by far the<br>most complex of organs and i'm sure that<br>every specialist will tell you that<br>their area is the most important but you<br>can rest assure that i'm right<br>people say the heart's important the<br>brain's complex but really where else<br>are there trillions and trillions of<br>single organisms that are bacteria<br>living inside us in harmony with our<br>body interacting in a way that's quite<br>natural we are more bug than<br>than human and the way in which that<br>interaction between bugs and humans<br>works together is of course very<br>important<br>so when things go wrong such as with<br>ulcerative colitis and here's a someone<br>with severe ulcer of colitis you can see<br>how someone with a gut like this could<br>easily end up with bleeding from the<br>bowel with diarrhea with weight loss and<br>be very unwell and obviously this is<br>something um that that we need to get<br>under control and likewise when we see<br>people<br>uh with crohn's disease which is more of<br>a patchy inflammation where there's<br>inflammation in some parts of the bowel<br>but not others we can see here that<br>there's a stricture in this part of the<br>bowel just here<br>narrowing<br>that that again people can be very<br>unwell with this and this is crohn's<br>disease so the crohn's disease and<br>ulcerative colitis are inflammatory<br>bowel diseases ibd and that's what i've<br>spent a lot of my work my time doing<br>research into and what i'm going to<br>speak about for a lot of what's to come<br>so here you can see a normal colon the<br>cartoon we can see a normal colon with<br>regards to<br>the um<br>the endoscopic findings and the biopsies<br>but for crohn's disease that<br>inflammation and for ulcerative colitis<br>as well and these are diseases that<br>don't have a cure so once you're<br>diagnosed it's something you'll always<br>have at the moment we don't have a cure<br>so our aim of treatment is trying to get<br>people into remission trying to control<br>their symptoms using a variety of<br>different things<br>so this is a slide that i put up often<br>and this was a slide that motivated me<br>to do research because it was put out by<br>the american gastroenterological<br>association in their slide set showing<br>how common ibd or inflammatory bowel<br>disease was around the world i was<br>really impressed about one thing and<br>really unimpressed about the other i was<br>impressed that they didn't cut the map<br>off here like they usually do because<br>most maps of the world they cut new<br>zealand off and we don't exist so that<br>was good but i was really unimpressed by<br>the data that suggested we had very<br>little inflammatory bowel disease<br>locally when the reality in clinic was<br>our clinics were full of patients with<br>crohn's and colitis it just didn't add<br>up really as far as i was concerned<br>so because of that we embarked on the<br>canterbury ibd project where as part of<br>my phd i tried to find everyone in<br>canterbury with ibd and i probably may<br>have found some of the people in this<br>room back between 2004 and 2006. and<br>from those people we collected an<br>enormous amount of data<br>um and uh and there were 1420 patients<br>and all and that data has enabled us to<br>so these were the worldwide data for the<br>number of new diagnoses of ulcerative<br>colitis in various places around the<br>world so down to here cardiff you can<br>see all these areas in the northern<br>hemisphere and increase over the years<br>so how would we stack up in new zealand<br>against that well here's the data for<br>ulcerative colitis so this is data here<br>for um for<br>for canada<br>here for for geelong in australia<br>here is where we were for christchurch<br>and you can see here wham this is data<br>from last year so data that we presented<br>done by heidi suen<br>and vikish gupta a summer student<br>looking at this increase in ulcerative<br>colitis so in 10 years we've doubled the<br>number of new diagnoses and that is is<br>standardized per 100 000 so it's not the<br>fact the population has gone up these<br>are new diagnosis and a very real<br>increase and likewise for crohn's<br>diseases increase all around the world<br>and what we're seeing here in in canada<br>very high rates everyone got very<br>excited we did our data and also found<br>high rates roughly equivalent to that<br>there's some data from geelong in<br>australia uh whereas i helped out with<br>that study from nelson we'd looked at<br>that previously last year in canterbury<br>wham up it goes again by 50<br>and there are many many reasons why this<br>could be and and we'll discuss some of<br>them and what's coming up and i'm sure<br>many people in the room will have ideas<br>as to why this is as well but this is a<br>real finding these are real new cases of<br>crohn's disease and remember there's no<br>cure so once you're diagnosed you have<br>it for life so this is a lifelong<br>disease<br>so who are these people well in the blue<br>you can see the data from 2004. so this<br>is the age of people who are diagnosed<br>so the five-year age groups along the<br>bottom and then the number of new<br>diagnoses up here so the blue bars are<br>the data from 2004 and in the red we can<br>see the data from 2014<br>showing that the increase in rates is<br>across the board in all age groups but<br>it's particularly affecting people in<br>this part of life here which is when<br>people are younger when they go into<br>university when they're forming<br>relationships when they're having<br>children all of those things which are<br>really important parts of people's lives<br>times in people's lives that they're<br>getting affected by these diseases and<br>what we need to do is understand why<br>that is a little bit better<br>so why so much ibd i don't plan to<br>answer that tonight because i don't have<br>the answer but i want to give you some<br>ideas and some hints from research that<br>we've done to date<br>so i ask you this question why is a<br>healthy gut like the dalai lama<br>well if we look at the gastrointestinal<br>tract and we<br>pretend this is the intestine here and<br>then this is the body here in the gut we<br>have billions and billions and billions<br>of bacteria<br>that live there<br>and they interact with our immune system<br>and if those bacteria were anywhere else<br>in your body there'd be a rampaging<br>infection there'd be inflammation going<br>on and all sorts of problems so like the<br>dalai lama in health the human gut<br>is tolerant it doesn't matter what's<br>going on it's tolerant it doesn't mind<br>but inflammatory bowel disease it's not<br>so flash<br>all of a sudden the ibd gut becomes like<br>poor henry<br>and you can imagine where this is going<br>you've got the intestine full of<br>bacteria all these problems going on<br>this interaction with the immune system<br>but you've got no tolerance<br>and this is what's going on is that<br>immune system is turning back on the<br>body turning back on the bacteria in the<br>gut and what's left what's caught in the<br>middle between the immune system and the<br>bacteria the gut and that's what gets<br>hammered by that inflammation and why<br>this is going on and what causes the<br>symptoms that come subsequently<br>so i find these venn diagrams sort of<br>helpful but unhelpful because if it was<br>this simple we know all the answers and<br>go we go home there'll be nothing to do<br>but in broad terms we know that there is<br>a genetic susceptibility to crohn's<br>disease and ulcerative colitis but it's<br>not black and white it's not blue eyes<br>and brown eyes it's much more<br>complicated than that<br>we know there are environmental triggers<br>where there are factors that we're<br>exposed to that may<br>trigger off crohn's disease or<br>ulcerative colitis in people and then<br>there's the host immune response so<br>people often ask me is ibd a genetic<br>disease well having a family history is<br>a strong risk factor<br>but most people don't have one and what<br>it is is that many of the genes that are<br>involved just increase your risk two or<br>three percent here two or three percent<br>here it's probably an additive effect<br>plus the environment on top that<br>eventually triggers you over the<br>threshold to develop inflammatory bowel<br>disease<br>here we can see a a cartoon<br>showing the gut at the top here and<br>these are the cells of the gut and these<br>are the immune cells and around the<br>outside are the many genes that have<br>been identified to be included with<br>inflammatory bowel disease now genetics<br>is really complicated i'm not going to<br>go through genes in detail tonight but<br>just to show you that in collaboration<br>with people like rebecca roberts and<br>martin kennedy we're able to identify<br>many of those genes through work done<br>locally<br>in inflammatory bowels and that's that's<br>led to<br>some marked discoveries and what it does<br>if you identify genes that might be<br>involved in the disease all of a sudden<br>it opens up the thought that perhaps<br>this pathway is important in disease so<br>perhaps we can just we can we can<br>develop a drug that will block that<br>so that's where a gene discovery a very<br>basic science discovery can lead to a<br>translational result further down the<br>track and that's why basic science is so<br>important to translational research<br>later on<br>so what else is going on well in the old<br>days the very old days when we were<br>cavemen with torches and etc life was<br>very different we lived in a pretty<br>dirty environment i'm not saying dirty<br>in a negative way dirty in a in a<br>positive way there were bacteria<br>everywhere there were chronic infections<br>there was no refrigeration we ate food<br>that had been lying out for a while<br>all these things were very different to<br>nowadays we live in a very hygienic and<br>clean society and certainly it's thought<br>that because we're exposed to fewer<br>bacteria now than we used to maybe that<br>changes the way that our immune system<br>interacts with the bacteria that are<br>there and maybe that could be something<br>that changes the way in which all of a<br>sudden inflammation is driven when we<br>don't have this wide repertoire of<br>infected infective stimuli going on in<br>our gut<br>so one of the big steps that came<br>forward from genetics was consortia<br>where groups from around the world<br>combine their information or their data<br>to work out some of the really big<br>questions and disease and inflammatory<br>bowel disease is one of the really good<br>examples where many groups from all<br>around the world were able to combine<br>their data to come up with some really<br>important answers<br>and this is a paper that was in nature<br>from two or three years ago that i was<br>very lucky to be involved in and to be<br>honest i don't understand a lot of it<br>because the amount of mathematics in<br>this is unbelievable and while i didn't<br>mind mathematics at school i liked<br>biology a lot more and and this was a<br>real struggle for me but essentially<br>they were able to combine the results of<br>37 000 ibd patients dna<br>and what we call a genome-wide<br>association study they met around<br>analyze that with other things and i<br>think it was really a triumph in<br>mathematics because the numbers that<br>you're talking here considering the<br>number of base pairs in the genome is<br>just uh is just incredible<br>and what we're able to do is identify<br>163 genes that clearly were associated<br>with inflammatory bowel disease and then<br>we'd look at where those genes were<br>involved in biology and that would help<br>us understand exactly what was going on<br>and certainly even by doing this we<br>still don't understand a lot about the<br>genetics of inflammatory bowel disease<br>and this is an idea of the complexity of<br>the way in which these genes interact<br>but i just want to take you through one<br>slide a couple of slides here just to<br>bring out a really important point that<br>that's come out from the study so this<br>this purple<br>purple dot here in the middle represents<br>the ibd genes<br>these genes here are genes associated<br>with immune mediated diseases<br>um here diseases are genes associated<br>with getting tb that predispose you to<br>getting tb and genes that predispose you<br>with leprosy and you might say how does<br>all this fit together you know<br>infections and<br>immune diseases<br>well one of the questions that this is<br>raised and it goes right back to darwin<br>who's sitting there at the bottom of the<br>page is in the infectious age people<br>were dying all the time from chronic<br>infections tb you name it people were<br>dropping over all the time<br>and if one was to develop a mutation in<br>your immune system that enabled you to<br>be resistant to some of these things<br>that would give you an enormous survival<br>advantage over other people in your<br>who are living at the same time and it's<br>likely that some of these genes were<br>were selected for<br>that gave protection against some of<br>these some of these bacteria but then of<br>course as life goes on and then all of a<br>sudden we change and we're in an<br>environment that's cleaner with lots of<br>antibiotics around we can treat all<br>these infections now then all of a<br>sudden those genes aren't so useful<br>anymore and in fact maybe those genes in<br>an environment that changes and becomes<br>a lot cleaner could in fact start<br>predisposing to an autoimmune disease<br>where the body's immune system is<br>attacking bacteria that are supposed to<br>be friendly to us so that's what this<br>sort of large study does it brings up<br>these very large ideas that we can then<br>drill down on to find out a lot more<br>but the environment's really where it's<br>at because if you get this rapid<br>increase in in the incidence of a new<br>disease you have to wonder why is that<br>why all of a sudden are we getting more<br>and more people the genes and the<br>overall population will remain the same<br>just be shuffled in different ways for<br>different people but what's coming with<br>the environment that's really making a<br>difference to what's going on so what<br>someone's once said genes load the gun<br>but environment pulls the trigger what<br>are these triggers that are going on so<br>to do this we looked at uh this in the<br>in in a case control study where we took<br>people with inflammatory bowel disease<br>and people without inflammatory bowel<br>disease who are matched for age and sex<br>and then we looked at ex different<br>things in each group to see whether<br>there was an association between disease<br>and not disease and here we can see what<br>these factors were and<br>this this this<br>column here is the one to focus on if<br>the number is greater than one the risk<br>is increased if it's less than one it's<br>decreased and what you can see a family<br>history does increase your risk it<br>doesn't mean that you're going to get it<br>100 but it does increase your risk<br>smoking<br>increases your risk of crohn's disease<br>interestingly decreases your risk of<br>ulcerative colitis but then when you<br>stop smoking you are more likely to get<br>ulcerative colitis which is a<br>paradox we don't understand very well<br>and again for<br>novel risk factors that we looked at<br>mothers who smoked during pregnancy<br>their children had an increased risk of<br>developing crohn's disease not a huge<br>increase but a small increase antibiotic<br>use also appeared to be associated with<br>an increased risk and this one we can't<br>understand very well but having a<br>vegetable garden in your property reduce<br>your risk of getting crohn's disease<br>it's probably something to do with<br>either being out in the dirt plain<br>perhaps it's a dietary thing that people<br>with a vegetable garden tend to have<br>different diets we can't explain it that<br>much but these give little clues as to<br>what might be going on<br>this information i think was very<br>interesting because there's a lot of<br>debate as to whether breastfeeding might<br>be protective so if you're breastfed<br>maybe you're less likely to eat crohn's<br>and some people thought that other<br>people didn't so we thought we'd tease<br>that apart a bit more and we looked at<br>how long people were breastfed for we've<br>got a wonderful thing in new zealand<br>called the royal new zealand plunkett<br>society and in your book which many of<br>you probably still have access to it'll<br>tell you how long you've respected to so<br>we had quite good data on that and what<br>we found that was breastfeeding was good<br>but it had to be for three months or<br>longer<br>and you might hypothesize that the<br>reason for that is that<br>people who are breastfed have different<br>bugs in their gut to people who are<br>bottle-fed and it may well be that that<br>those different bacteria maybe<br>probiotics or different bacteria that<br>are there are more able to lead to a<br>healthier gut and those who are<br>breastfed in saying that<br>i've still know lots of patients who are<br>breastfed for more than 12 months who've<br>got crohn's disease these aren't<br>absolute things but they give us a clue<br>as to what might be going on<br>okay fecal microbiota so when it comes<br>down to it what's in our gut is very<br>very important and it really is the<br>final frontier when it comes to going on<br>with health and i say that not just with<br>regards to inflammatory bowel disease<br>but jenny willis is on the front run i<br>think renee wilson's here as well at the<br>moment we're doing a project looking at<br>gut microflora and diabetes because we<br>think that gut microflora has got much<br>more to do than just about gut health<br>but in fact it's probably got things to<br>do with obesity diabetes all sorts of<br>diseases it all starts in the gut i told<br>you it was important no one's been<br>listening but i told you it is very very<br>important and i think the university of<br>otago is very well positioned for doing<br>research in this area and certainly<br>we're collaborating widely and trying to<br>to tease this apart<br>we've got a good example of this is some<br>work here by catherine moore who's<br>another phd student working with us both<br>renee and catherine are dietitians and<br>we're feeding people with with crohn's<br>disease exclusive mental nutrition so<br>that means you get formula fed but no<br>food for two weeks we'll give you enough<br>formula that it's all you need for<br>complete nutritional<br>capacity if you like and here we can see<br>on the left a patient and these are each<br>of the bars is a baseline two weeks four<br>weeks six weeks eight weeks and<br>afterwards and these are different<br>bacteria and what you can see this<br>patient got better with exclusive mental<br>nutrition and they have sustained<br>changes in these bacteria over time and<br>what that makes us think is can we<br>modulate the bacteria that live in our<br>gut by what we eat and can that<br>therefore<br>change inflammation or change other<br>things that are going on and on the<br>other side you can see as someone who<br>didn't get better and their data all<br>over the place so maybe in that person<br>we're not able to to have the same<br>effect because we can't change the gut<br>flora in the same way and these are the<br>new ways that we start to think about<br>how we might better manage people with<br>different diseases<br>we've done some work with mycobacterium<br>even paratuberculosis as well these are<br>little<br>microbes that<br>have been associated with crohn's<br>disease but the treatment trials have<br>been negative although we're about to<br>start a new treatment trial quite soon<br>in the area<br>i couldn't give a talk without talking<br>about fecal transplant because<br>as a gastroenterologist that's probably<br>the most common question i'm asked about<br>is<br>you know is fecal transplant something<br>that's going to make you better and for<br>many things in life i think it's better<br>to give than receive and i think that<br>for fecal transplant that's probably<br>another very good example<br>and while um while michael k hirst had a<br>fantastic resort a result from taking<br>someone else's feces mixing it up and<br>injecting it into his own colon there<br>are no randomised trials that suggest<br>that for inflammatory bowel disease<br>that's an effective therapy so therefore<br>as a<br>as a clinician and as a scientist i<br>can't even though patients ask me about<br>it something i can't say we should do<br>until there are some trials<br>that do it and i think we need to find<br>some phd students or other people who<br>want to take that part over because i'm<br>not so sure i want to be involved in it<br>but it's a fascinating concept now why<br>not just change all of your gut flora by<br>putting someone a donor's faeces in and<br>changing all of those bacteria but again<br>personally i'd rather wait for some data<br>to know that was worthwhile before<br>rushing in and doing it to myself or my<br>patients<br>so inflammation is what's behind<br>inflammatory bowel disease it's very<br>important it's what the crux of it is<br>and also tells us about biomarkers<br>potentially because if we could<br>find out found out about markers in the<br>gut and the faeces that told us what was<br>going on then perhaps we need to do less<br>of this and while i love doing this my<br>patients don't always share my<br>enthusiasm for it so if we could come up<br>with other ways of identifying what's<br>going on in the gut by looking in the<br>feces for measuring things then that<br>would be a real advantage and certainly<br>over time we know that in inflammatory<br>bowels where there's flares of disease<br>and with each flare of disease<br>the gut gets damaged and this damage may<br>be irreversible so if we can identify<br>inflammation more easily we can treat it<br>more aggressively and maybe lead to<br>better outcomes<br>here we can see some work by nick magon<br>looking at at cal protector and looking<br>at modifications of this this works down<br>with mark hampton and tony kettle in the<br>free radical research group here in the<br>school of medicine three floors up from<br>here and they are able to identify<br>proteins in<br>body fluids that reflect inflammation<br>and this modified cal protector i think<br>has got a lot of promise<br>we've also got data here from um<br>looking with andrew day<br>rob lopez and anna ashcroft looking at<br>s100 a12 and what you can see as we go<br>across the sliders here are controls<br>with no inflammation here are people<br>with severe crohn's disease so there's<br>this<br>trend of increasing concentrations of<br>these proteins in the faeces and once we<br>can understand where the cutoffs are and<br>whether we can be accurately predicted<br>we can translate that into clinical<br>practice and we've been able to do that<br>recently as a study called the poker<br>study which was in australia in new<br>zealand studying don't worry about the<br>details on here i'll take you through<br>them in a minute but we found patients<br>who had had needed to have part of their<br>bowel cut out for crohn's disease but<br>what we know is that when the bowels<br>join back together it'll work the<br>crohn's comes back in the joint quite<br>often and we need to know that because<br>if the if the inflammations come back<br>then we need to treat people more<br>aggressively but if it hasn't come back<br>then we can be relaxed and not worry<br>about it so much but that would mean a<br>colonoscopy for that patient all the<br>time so as part of the study we measured<br>calprotectin in<br>in<br>the faeces of these people and what<br>we're able to find was that with 90<br>accuracy we could predict whether there<br>was inflammation back at that joint or<br>not that's recently been<br>accepted to gastroenterology and the<br>main paper has also gone into the lancet<br>so these are major findings that we're<br>able to do and that research was done<br>locally here patients local patients<br>taking part in that research and<br>combining with other centres in<br>australia as well<br>it's hard to talk about the gut without<br>talking about the brain and certainly<br>the gut brain axis is something that<br>many people recognize that the way<br>things are going on in your brain can<br>affect your gut and vice versa<br>and i often give the example to patients<br>where i'll say to them you'll remember<br>when before school cert that half your<br>class rushed off to the toilet half went<br>to cheat and write things on their hands<br>and the other half went to have<br>diarrhoea because they were so nervous<br>and this connection between the gut and<br>the brain is present on many different<br>levels and i don't have time to explore<br>that fully tonight but i just draw<br>attention to andrew mccombie who<br>dr andrew mccombie recently graduated<br>with his phd<br>roger mulder and i supervised him and he<br>looked at how people cope<br>with disease with inflammatory bowel<br>disease and developed with help from<br>some australian collaborators an online<br>tool where patients could go through a<br>program<br>learning how to manage stress and other<br>anxieties in a better way leading to<br>better outcomes and he's currently in<br>barcelona presenting that research<br>although i'd much rather be here in<br>christchurch presenting to you than in<br>barcelona<br>i'm just going to finish by talking<br>about the diet and gut because again um<br>there's various things that occur to you<br>in your practice and career as a doctor<br>where someone says something to your<br>patient you think you know they're right<br>but i can't give them an answer i know<br>they've hit the nail on the head but i<br>can't quite work out where i'm going to<br>take that i still remember a patient<br>saying to me<br>what are you going on about the gut's a<br>food machine<br>clearly that's where the answer's got to<br>be and i just still remember that was<br>about 12 years ago it's in the back of<br>my mind i've always thought if we can<br>understand that interaction between diet<br>and the gut it's going to take us a long<br>way towards um towards understanding how<br>disease works as well<br>so some of the things i've been involved<br>with in the past include intestinal<br>failure so what happens when you run out<br>of gut so if you have lots of operations<br>and there's not enough gut left or if<br>the gut doesn't work properly and<br>certainly we can put tubes in through<br>the nose and we can put peg tubes in<br>through the skin into the stomach and<br>we can also feed people<br>through a formula directly into a vein<br>completely bypassing the gut altogether<br>but that's got a lot of risk associated<br>with it and a lot of potential problems<br>as well and we don't have to do that<br>very often but there are some places in<br>the world where they do that a lot and<br>so mark's hospital in london i was lucky<br>to go there for for three months and i<br>looked at they've got a big intestinal<br>failure that treats a lot of people from<br>all around the united kingdom and what<br>we found was that in the patients that<br>were there there were two major reasons<br>for um for<br>why patients got intestinal failure<br>aggressive crohn's disease and that<br>brought home to me why we have to treat<br>crohn's disease aggressively and also<br>lots of surgical complications and<br>certainly um<br>that doesn't those surgical<br>complications are things that sometimes<br>happen but i'm certainly very happy here<br>with the very high quality of colorectal<br>surgeons that we have in canterbury that<br>really provide very good support for our<br>ibd patients who need to have surgery<br>the other thing i'm interested in<br>leaving ibd behind for a while is ibs<br>and this is irritable bowel syndrome<br>which is really common so one in six<br>women one in nine men have got irritable<br>bowel syndrome the gut looks completely<br>normal so that gives me the happy smiley<br>face the nice gut with the with the<br>capillaries on that you can see but<br>people get bloating and pain and wind<br>and diarrhea and constipation and it<br>used to be very frustrating for us<br>because very clearly patients were<br>unwell but everything looked normal<br>and<br>obviously that was fine but actually<br>these people had real symptoms and<br>actually had real effects on their<br>quality of life so certainly i was very<br>lucky and i'll talk a little bit about<br>low fodmap diet<br>because i was involved in some of that<br>work in australia but i've also been<br>doing work with kiwifruit on zespri and<br>kiwifruit extracts with a company called<br>anagenix looking at ways of improving<br>particularly constipation as we all know<br>kiwifruit are good to keep you going so<br>uh so certainly we're always on the<br>lookout for for patients who can help<br>with those studies but when it comes to<br>fodmaps<br>is much easier to say than fermentable<br>oligosaccharides disaccharides<br>monosaccharides and polyols<br>so we'll just say fodmap but essentially<br>this whole concept of fodmaps came about<br>through peter gibson who's there on top<br>there and and sue shepard who's a<br>dietitian peter gibson's a<br>gastroenterologist who works in<br>melbourne and she's a dietitian and this<br>came about through clinical observation<br>if there are students in the audience<br>you're obviously the really keen ones to<br>be here this late but<br>you know simple clinical observations of<br>what was going on trial and error coming<br>up with a hypothesis and and testing it<br>it's really uh how this came about<br>so fodmaps uh oligosaccharides these are<br>fructans galactans so they're found in<br>beans onions windy sort of vegetables<br>you get the drift<br>also they're found wherever you find<br>gluten which is why many people will go<br>on a gluten-free diet and feel better<br>not because of the gluten probably<br>there's not much data to support gluten<br>causing problems outside of celiac<br>disease but more to do with the fructans<br>that are found where you find gluten<br>lactose in some people can cause<br>problems but not in every one<br>fructose in some people can cause<br>problems apples and pears in particular<br>lots of lots of fructose in those<br>and polyols are also very important<br>and um you probably used to think that<br>it was karma which was the reason why<br>when you went over the to the neighbors<br>and stole their apricots and had a big<br>feed of them that you've got diarrhoea<br>afterwards so it wasn't calmer it was<br>sorbitol that was actually doing that<br>and causing that diarrhea as it came<br>through as a fodmap and causing those<br>symptoms<br>so all of those things cause<br>problems because they're osmotically<br>active in the bowel they pull fluid into<br>the bowel and they're fermented so they<br>get fermentation going on stretching the<br>bowel causing wind i can feel you<br>getting more bloated as i'm talking<br>about this and that stretches stretches<br>the gut causes pain causes wind causes<br>diarrhea and causes symptoms and the<br>bowel looks normal but the gut's very<br>sensitive in people with variable bowel<br>syndrome and that's why they get these<br>symptoms<br>and if we're going to put that in a<br>cartoon with a small bowel on the left<br>the large bell on the right the fodmaps<br>go through the small bowel bringing<br>fluid into the bowel delivering that<br>fluid to the colon stretching the bowel<br>producing that fluid increasing gas<br>fluid causing those symptoms and<br>while it's interesting nutrition i think<br>in nutrition there are lots of theories<br>without much evidence but in fact when<br>it comes to low fodmap diet there's an<br>enormous amount of evidence and they've<br>done studies in patients with an<br>ileostomy where they give them a high<br>fodmap diet and a low fodmap diet and<br>those with a high fodmap diet have a 20<br>increase in their stoma output so you<br>can you can measure these things and<br>that's been done and we're also lucky to<br>have a dutch student come over ran out<br>who looked at our practice locally and<br>found that um<br>very similar response rates in these<br>groups of patients so i think this has<br>been a real game changer the life format<br>died i feel very privileged to be<br>involved in it because of the year i<br>spent in melbourne with peter and sue<br>where we did a lot of this work<br>so i'll wrap up<br>just now but<br>the gut is a wonderful thing you know<br>you're all here because you clearly<br>believe so so i'm preaching to the<br>converted but it is an amazing organ and<br>it's got an amazing interactions with<br>the bacteria that live within it with<br>the immune system with many other parts<br>and things that are around<br>gut disease in<br>in in canterbury and around the world<br>but especially in canterbury is more<br>common than you think and we need to<br>talk about it so if you have symptoms<br>you need to go and see your doctor you<br>don't need to wait two years and find<br>out that actually it's something that<br>was quite treatable but it's too late<br>gut research is really important for gut<br>health and a large amount of the<br>research that i've alluded to tonight<br>not just my own research but research<br>carried out by others locally has been<br>funded locally by the bowel lover trust<br>and by other other organizations as well<br>if that research isn't funded it doesn't<br>happen and that's very very important<br>and if you've got a healthy gut you've<br>got a happy healthy life and i think<br>that often um there's a lot of anecdotes<br>and a lot of sayings that that reflect<br>how gut health reflects a healthy a<br>healthy life as well and certainly a<br>collaborative approach is the key to<br>success and working together<br>now this is an ipl uh not the ipo in<br>india but an inaugural professorial<br>lecturer and while that sort of means it<br>is a little bit about me i don't work in<br>isolation and i make no mistake i've got<br>no apologies for the number of<br>acknowledgements i'm about to go through<br>because each and every one of them are<br>very important firstly my research<br>students these are the people that do<br>all the hard work these are the people<br>that have to deal with the problems that<br>i can just talk about abstractly and<br>then they let you go and sort them out<br>and i'm very grateful for the very hard<br>work that many of them have done over<br>many years<br>we've had an amazing selection of summer<br>students these are students who<br>spend 10 weeks with us doing a very<br>small project that's gone from andrew<br>dodgson back in 2003 all the way through<br>to vakesh just now who was involved in<br>that study that showed such a high rate<br>of inflammatory bowel disease in<br>canterbury<br>we've had some amazing research students<br>from around the world join us for short<br>periods of time particularly from the vu<br>university in amsterdam<br>and i was over there recently at a<br>conference and had dinner with this<br>group of students and they're amazing<br>people who come in with a great outlook<br>on life and flores is here tonight he's<br>about to start on monday so no pressure<br>we've had some fantastic registries on<br>how surgeons have helped with with<br>research and research isn't for everyone<br>but certainly a lot of um of people have<br>done some great work and i'm very<br>grateful to them then there's everyone<br>else and<br>i had to stop because it would have been<br>illegible and i'm going to leave it up<br>there for a while but there are people<br>from all around the world and from<br>locally who have done amazing things to<br>support gut research and those people i<br>think have to be acknowledged for what<br>they do<br>a lot of it they do a good will and and<br>certainly i'm very very grateful<br>and as i mentioned before it doesn't<br>happen unless there's some money to pay<br>for those students who do a phd they<br>hate three years off from medical<br>studies or or medical careers to do that<br>work and they need to be fed you know<br>not much but something<br>so so getting money to pay their<br>stipends getting money to pay for their<br>consumables is so important again the<br>bowel never trusts which you'll read<br>about a lot in the magazine that you've<br>got in front of you is one of the major<br>contributors to research locally<br>there's a few academic mentors i'd like<br>to mention specifically the first is<br>mark burrows who isn't on here the<br>reason he's on here is that i cannot<br>find a photo of him anywhere i rang<br>every embarros in the phone book<br>in christchurch and none of them know<br>who he is i don't know where he is but<br>he was my teacher at st martin's primary<br>school truly inspirational person who<br>really got me going<br>graham warner is my biology teacher is<br>here tonight i'm very grateful for him<br>as well<br>and all the encouragement and interest<br>he got me into biology with as well<br>bruce and michael in the department<br>really<br>done a lot i think to help me over the<br>years bruce<br>the most amazing inquiring mind you'll<br>ever meet someone who won't take no for<br>an answer will follow through something<br>right to the very end and for michael<br>for his pragmatism and just getting the<br>job done and peter gibson as well<br>in australia who has been very<br>supportive<br>i'm very grateful to my family my mother<br>and father and roy and denise for all<br>the support they've given me and for my<br>brother andrew for inspiration<br>and my wife just seen the children for<br>putting up with me having to work hard<br>all right sorry i wasn't supposed to do<br>that<br>i just want to finish with this picture<br>which is part of a photo we say which<br>one of my patients put together<br>his name is sam sword and had crohn's<br>disease and he had it quite badly he was<br>in hospital a lot and he put together he<br>got a model to essentially<br>take photographs of different things in<br>the way in which<br>his experience of disease was like<br>and<br>at the end of the day it all comes back<br>to our patients if we're doctors how our<br>patients are what they experience and<br>how we can help them<br>and i think that we need to acknowledge<br>that and recognize that really the<br>patients are aware we come from when it<br>comes to clinical research but bringing<br>that basic research through becomes very<br>important</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
