and it is my great<br>pleasure to welcome you to this<br>inaugural professorial lecture<br>as I look out on the audience I can see<br>both academic and general staff from<br>around the university actually in fact I<br>think I've spotted people from all four<br>academic divisions in just the short<br>period of time that I've been in here<br>which again I think reflects the general<br>interest in these inaugural professorial<br>lectures<br>I'd also like to extend a particularly<br>warm welcome to some special guests<br>Professor Wing's son jack his daughter<br>Tess and his partner Lucy are with us in<br>the audience this evening and we would<br>like to acknowledge you because we<br>understand that getting to the rank of<br>Professor is usually a family affair and<br>requires some late nights and some times<br>that your dad probably wanted to be with<br>you and was doing something else so we<br>really do appreciate your contribution<br>to his promotion to Professor<br>now these ipls are a very special<br>occasion for everyone who is here not<br>only Professor wing and his family<br>but they are also a very special<br>occasion for us because they do give us<br>the opportunity to just take some time<br>and reflect on all the Fantastic<br>academics we have here at the University<br>of otago and for Professor Wing<br>obviously this lecture this evening is<br>the culmination of 20 years of academic<br>life here at the University of otago and<br>I think it's a very fitting occasion for<br>him to mark his incredible success<br>the University of otago is the most<br>science intensive University in New<br>Zealand and I'm always very happy to<br>remind people about that but it's also a<br>university where our world-class<br>scientists take a brave step out of<br>their own Laboratories or out of the<br>field and actually apply their research<br>to real world issues here in New Zealand<br>and overseas and Professor Wing's work<br>in Marine ecology is an exact excellent<br>way in which he has used 21st century<br>scientific techniques both from the lab<br>and from the field to solve some really<br>important problems about Wildlife<br>Management here in New Zealand so we are<br>very very proud of the contribution that<br>he is making to the country more<br>generally<br>His science is not only world class but<br>it's also extraordinarily valuable to<br>conservation issues here in New Zealand<br>and he is helping us to protect some of<br>the things that we all hold so dear<br>about New Zealand<br>in closing I would just like to say that<br>we are all very proud to call Professor<br>Wing one of our own and we look very<br>forward to hearing what he has to share<br>with us this evening I would now like to<br>call on Professor Keith Hunter who is<br>the pro Vice Chancellor of Sciences to<br>tell us just a little bit more about<br>Professor Wing's journey to becoming<br>professor<br>then give us Chancellor and and let me<br>add to that by saying that this is one<br>of the most Pleasant jobs that I have as<br>provice Chancellor introducing our new<br>science professors and telling you a bit<br>about them<br>Steve was born in Gainesville Florida<br>and grew up on a small family farm that<br>was operated by his father James<br>was also a Potter and founded a<br>cooperative for artisans in Gainesville<br>and his mother Elizabeth was a professor<br>of zoo archeology at the University of<br>Florida and it's clear from his history<br>that both parents<br>exercised an important influence on<br>Steve's development<br>he he tells us that he had great<br>experiences in High School volunteering<br>to work with research biologists from<br>the University<br>and was able to get involved in a range<br>of activities including tagging sea<br>turtles studying manatees and even<br>getting out on on NOAA that's the<br>National Oceanic and Atmospheric<br>Administration<br>cruises in the Gulf of Mexico<br>he got his BSC on his<br>from Humboldt State University in 1987<br>and as part of his degree he took some<br>classes at Stanford's Hopkins Marine<br>laboratory and also had an internship at<br>the Monterey Bay Aquarium which was<br>quite new at that time<br>he also had a year off before going on<br>to graduate school working on a field<br>course in subtitle communities<br>run by the Hopkins Marine laboratory and<br>also doing some work<br>involving sea otters and work on a<br>Native American Indian reservation on a<br>salmon project<br>at University of California Davis he did<br>his PhD entitled the physical<br>biological coupling mechanisms in the<br>near shore ocean<br>and then he did a postdoc at UC Davis<br>funded by the National Academy of<br>Sciences<br>and that involved quite a few days at<br>Sea on Research ships and so when Tess<br>was born he decided it was time to get a<br>real job<br>which explains how he arrived in otago<br>in late 1997 he was appointed to a<br>lectureship here at otago<br>of course when you come to New Zealand<br>from overseas one of the first things<br>you have to learn about<br>is the local culture and so early in it<br>were in 1998 a group of post-grids from<br>Marine Science decided it was time Steve<br>went to a rugby game<br>and so he was taken to carisbrook on a<br>very wintry day to watch a test match<br>between the All Blacks and England and I<br>dare say there are a few people in the<br>room who were at that game as was I<br>when he when he arrived at the ticket<br>counter to get in he was given a large<br>black placard which had the word try on<br>it<br>and Steve assumed that this was a device<br>that could be used to encourage the All<br>Blacks when they were flagging and so<br>each time the England team looked like<br>it was getting somewhere he'd leap up<br>and wave around this plaque out and yell<br>try<br>of course he was the only person in the<br>audience that was doing that<br>but he's not slow Steve and he cottoned<br>on pretty quickly<br>and quickly reverted to the custom of<br>only waving it around when the All<br>Blacks scored<br>he had to do a lot of that that day<br>because For the record this was the 20th<br>of June 1998 the All Blacks beat England<br>64-22<br>it was a great game it was the it was<br>the first game<br>as Captain for one of our Local Heroes<br>and alumni that was tane Randall who<br>captained the All Blacks for the first<br>time and he scored two tries during the<br>game so I can think you can say that<br>Steve's introduction to rugby was well<br>done<br>all joking aside Steve um<br>congratulations on your richly deserved<br>promotion to professor and I invite you<br>to give your inaugural Professor a<br>lecture<br>thank you BC and thank you PVC for that<br>for that introduction<br>um it's a real privilege to work at this<br>fine academic teaching and research<br>institute and I I feel really honored to<br>be here this evening<br>um I want to give a a particular<br>acknowledgment to my colleagues in the<br>department of Marine Science in the<br>ecology degree program and in the otago<br>research center for oceanography and you<br>make doing ocean science at otago really<br>exciting and fun and basic recent<br>developments in in terms of bringing new<br>talent to the university in terms of new<br>facilities and in the in the breadth and<br>scope of Marine Science that we can<br>offer to students<br>have have made this had have made this<br>truly a world-class Center for for doing<br>ocean science<br>so I'm going to talk to you tonight<br>about southern ocean ecosystems and sort<br>of experiences that have have brought me<br>to to thinking about ecology at the<br>ecosystem level<br>and these experiences have been<br>have have led me towards trying to<br>understand our place in ecosystems and<br>and the Dynamics of of Southern Ocean<br>ecosystems now<br>every good ecological story starts with<br>a walk in the woods and for me growing<br>up in Florida<br>my Southern Ocean was the Caribbean Sea<br>small s and one of my early sort of<br>walks in the woods happened in this<br>contraption which was run by the<br>national undersea Research Center this<br>is the Aquarius undersea saturation<br>diving habitat and what you can do in<br>this thing is live for a couple of weeks<br>at a time on the on the sea floor<br>because your tissues in your body are<br>saturated with nitrogen at about four<br>atmospheres it means that you basically<br>have unlimited time to swim out on the<br>reef and make observations about the<br>life that lives there<br>and<br>just being able to do that just being<br>able to spend enough time to make<br>observations out in the natural world<br>was to me a really valuable experience<br>you could you started to look at the<br>marine life that lived on the on the<br>reef more as Wildlife rather than just<br>fish you might put on your plate<br>I worked early on I worked on this<br>project with a couple of scientists Mark<br>Denney from Hopkins Marine station and<br>Jim leichter both who had real skills in<br>hydrodynamics and one of the things we<br>we observed out on the reef is that up<br>Shallow on the reef things are quite<br>stable as you'd expect on a coral reef<br>collect Clear Water the water is<br>somewhere between 28 and 30 degrees so<br>relatively warm not much happening<br>really quite quite a quite a static<br>environment<br>but deep on the reef daily<br>twice a day there were periods of<br>intense turmoil we'd be down deep on the<br>reef somewhere around 30 meters and<br>these walls of turbulent water would<br>come washing in on the reef they had<br>density differences on them so they were<br>they were opaque and they'd they'd wash<br>up the reef and all the reef fish would<br>come and feed along the edge of these<br>walls of water as they sloshed over the<br>reef<br>now it turns out these were turbulent<br>bores these were broken internal waves<br>now if you know a bit about ocean<br>physics you'll know that waves can<br>propagate on any density surface between<br>two different fluids and these are waves<br>that propagate through inside of the<br>ocean on the thermocline on the on the<br>density Cline inside of the ocean they<br>Crest up and break on the continental<br>shelf and then form these turbulent<br>borers of water that washed up on the<br>continental shelf under the coral reef<br>much like the waves on a beach<br>so deep on the reef somewhere around 30<br>meters periodically the temperatures<br>would change from 27 28 degrees down to<br>20 degrees 10 degree job or 8 degree<br>drop in temperature in a matter of<br>seconds<br>and this this process was driving cold<br>nutrient-rich water up onto the reef on<br>it turns out that after about six of<br>these trips we studied all sorts of<br>different processes on the reef and<br>everything we studied from physiology of<br>corals to productivity on the reef to<br>the effect of of this process on on<br>delivery of nutrients and food up onto<br>the reef they were all driven by this<br>one physical process<br>and it taught me early on that if you<br>want to Be an Effective Marine ecologist<br>if you want to understand Marine systems<br>you should make some friends with some<br>Physics for some physicists and some<br>chemists here Dale Stokes from the<br>Marine physics unit at Scripps and our<br>own Russell through from the chemistry<br>Department helped Define some of these<br>processes on on the reef<br>this extends to larger scale processes<br>in in Marine systems it extends to our<br>understanding of populations<br>and<br>um if when you start to think about<br>population structure when you start to<br>think about the processes that drive<br>populations in Marine systems it's<br>important to<br>understand the distinction between<br>closed populations and open populations<br>or population networks that we find in<br>the ocean<br>so this is one of our cows this is<br>Heather and she's a part of a closed<br>population<br>it's quite an artificial population we<br>have events around Heather she's part of<br>a herd but as a population biologist<br>understanding reproduction by Heather a<br>little calf Angus there is quite a<br>simple Affair as soon as she reached<br>sexual maturity she can have a calf a<br>year she'll live to about 12. I can<br>figure out quite easily the reproductive<br>potential of that animal and the calf<br>will become a member of the herd it'll<br>become a member of the local population<br>now this is quite an artificial<br>situation but it the same sorts of<br>things apply to populations on Islands<br>populations where we know the boundaries<br>of them<br>that's a rock lobster spiny Lobster Jay<br>says eduards the eye<br>reproduction for a rock lobster scales<br>with its body size reproduction and<br>fecundity is geometrically related to<br>the size of that animal so larger rock<br>lobsters can can produce many more young<br>and smaller rock lobsters<br>they also shed larvae out into the ocean<br>and those larvae will be out there for<br>up to 18 months so their pattern of<br>movement their survival and their<br>eventual settlement into<br>their populations depends on Ocean<br>physics it depends on transport<br>mechanisms it also depends on the<br>communities that are living in the ocean<br>and understanding population<br>connectivity for something like a rock<br>this was the main sort of goal of this<br>postdoc that Keith was talking about I<br>worked in the California Current with<br>again some physical oceanographers and<br>some mathematical modelers and we were<br>interested in what connected populations<br>of Dungeness crab Dungeness crab are<br>these tasty things you can buy on in in<br>San Francisco and understanding how<br>circulation in the California Current<br>helped us do this<br>the California Current is dominated by<br>Coastal upwelling so you get equator<br>word winds that drive water offshore you<br>get upwelling of very cold water along<br>the coast but it doesn't happen evenly<br>along the coast it happens in Patches at<br>Headlands and Below Headlands there are<br>areas where there's retention basins<br>where larvae get congregated when the<br>winds shut down those retention basins<br>spill up the coast in a coastally<br>trapped buoyancy current and they<br>connect populations between Headlands<br>that sets the scale for population<br>Dynamics it sets the spatial scale for<br>population Dynamics which is a key<br>feature for understanding this this type<br>of population<br>and it's a key feature for managing<br>those populations<br>as Keith mentioned I am the son of a zoo<br>archaeologist and<br>um<br>the other feature of marine<br>ecosystems that's very important is is<br>US of course we've been a part of marine<br>ecosystems for thousands of years and<br>we've had a tremendous effect on their<br>structure and function over that time<br>and who better to learn that from than<br>your mom<br>so we did this project on some midden<br>remains from the Caribbean we didn't we<br>did a a<br>an ecological analysis on these remains<br>to try to understand the pattern of<br>human use of resources in what's really<br>a nice microcosm for larger scale<br>patterns in Fisheries<br>we found some interesting patterns some<br>important patterns for understanding<br>larger scale influences of Fisheries of<br>of man on Fisheries<br>so this graph which goes from the paper<br>was was written in 2001 so 2000 year<br>there is the the year zero and what we<br>looked at was two occupations of five<br>different islands in the Caribbean and<br>we analyze the trophic level of the<br>community of reef fish that people were<br>depending on what you see there is that<br>as pu as human populations grew and<br>there's about a tenfold difference<br>between early and late occupations with<br>human populations increasing<br>there's a shift from predatory species<br>towards lower terrific level species<br>herbivorous type species<br>this is a pattern that's actually<br>occurred globally now and we see in a<br>lot of the worlds marine ecosystems a<br>loss of these top predators<br>and it was happening thousands of years<br>ago in the Caribbean<br>another pattern we observe is that those<br>species that have an offshore Refuge or<br>some Refuge outside of the local area<br>that was being exploited were more<br>robust to changes than the species that<br>were entirely within the realm of<br>exploitation so species that have some<br>safe place were really robust to this<br>this kind of exploitation<br>now this point was really brought home<br>to me when I was in graduate school I<br>went to a conference as you do and it<br>was about 1992 it was a conference in<br>Nanaimo British Columbia<br>and at this conference we were it was a<br>Fisheries conference at this conference<br>we were addressed by the minister of<br>Fisheries of Canada<br>and he came into the room at the<br>beginning looking like something the cat<br>brought in and he announced to the<br>assembled group of scientists that the<br>Northwest Atlantic cod fish fishery had<br>collapsed and that the government was<br>putting a moratorium on this Fishery<br>now that announcement put 35 000 people<br>out of work on the day it was the<br>largest industrial closer in Canadian<br>history it was an absolute cataclysmic<br>failure in our ability to manage this<br>Marine resource<br>now the cod fish fishery was under the<br>control or under the management of the<br>Department of fisheries and oceans in<br>Canada which is arguably the largest<br>sort of government body in the world<br>responsible for Fisheries it has<br>spectacular funding and very very smart<br>people one of those smart people is Carl<br>Walters he got MacArthur award and he<br>has he has quite a CV and he was the<br>architect for much of what we do in<br>fisheries management today he stood up<br>and said this which is quite a<br>remarkable statement for someone who<br>spent 30 years in fishery science he<br>said that if you look at successful<br>Fisheries around the world those that<br>have been successful<br>are successful because there's a spatial<br>accident there's some place where<br>there's a refuge<br>for the stock there's some place where<br>the spawning stock can be safe from<br>exploitation<br>a spatial rather than a a<br>refuge created by more escapement or or<br>right so those are the sorts of<br>experience they've kind of tempered my<br>view of marine ecosystems of ecosystem<br>Dynamics and as I sort of progressed I<br>started to think about ecosystem<br>Dynamics in terms of of hierarchies of<br>things that occur within them<br>the first of those the first sort of<br>thing to know about ecosystems is what<br>drives the engine of the system what<br>produces the productivity that feeds the<br>whole ecosystem and the best way to<br>learn this is to study primary<br>production to study physical influences<br>on primary production and the patterns<br>in primary production across the<br>landscape<br>patterns in primary production Drive<br>patterns in spatial dynamics of<br>populations because different<br>subpopulations across space are<br>variously driven by different amounts of<br>productivity and the connectivity that<br>the the transport that connects<br>populations across space is also key to<br>those Dynamics so a key to understanding<br>populations is first understanding the<br>base their food<br>when you start to understand populations<br>then you can start to put populations<br>together into food webs into interacting<br>systems and at that stage understanding<br>food web structure the flux of organic<br>matter through food webs the consequence<br>of changes in the food web to that flux<br>of organic matter is a way to define<br>ecosystem function it's a way to have a<br>measure for how ecosystems work organic<br>matter is the currency of ecosystems and<br>being able to track it and nutrients is<br>a is a key feature<br>so that's kind of what brought me to New<br>Zealand one of the one of the things<br>that really drew me to this place was<br>the fjordlin marine ecosystem<br>fjordland is a playground for someone<br>who wants to study<br>the physical influences on biological<br>systems because it has some of the most<br>intense physical gradients in the world<br>and they're very accessible and very<br>replicated through the system in a<br>series of basins the fjordland was<br>formed during the pleistocene glaciation<br>it's 15 different fjords and each one of<br>them has key features about it that<br>controls variously the amount of<br>retention of larvae and the amount of<br>productivity that occurs within the<br>fjords this system has become what I<br>think is new one of New Zealand's really<br>first important experiments in ecosystem<br>management<br>okay so so movement of larvae among<br>fjords is influenced primarily by<br>esteroiding circulation each one of the<br>fjords has a freshwater layer that flows<br>across the surface and if you look at<br>these cross sections in three different<br>fjords you'll see the doubtful sound up<br>at the top has lots of fresh water that<br>fresh water layer mixes salt water up<br>into it and there's a net transport of<br>salt water out the entrance of the Fjord<br>now to maintain salt balance within the<br>Basin you have to have an equal amount<br>of salt come in in the form of seawater<br>underneath that seawoodly moving fresh<br>water so this creates a conveyor belt<br>circulation now most larvae can't<br>survive in fresh water so it's a trap<br>it's a retentive trap for larvae the<br>amount of Esterline circulations going<br>to vary with the amount of fresh water<br>that's driving it and that's different<br>in the different fjords so a really neat<br>system for understanding how connected<br>populations might be across the<br>landscape<br>another thing that varies are the<br>physical features that drive<br>productivity those things that make kelp<br>grow phytoplankton grow and two of the<br>main ones are on the left there the wave<br>energy in the fjords again that<br>tremendous gradient in terms of the<br>amount of wave energy this is a model of<br>the wave energy it sort of approximates<br>how much you have and it was developed<br>by Hamish Bowman in a GIS we made but<br>this is the significant wave height<br>which is the two-thirds largest wave and<br>spectrum and it varies between about 3.7<br>out near the outer Coast to the glass<br>move conditions in the interfered so<br>again the tremendous gradient in terms<br>of the amount of water that's moving<br>around as you enter into the fjords the<br>light environment also is tremendously<br>variable and here we've developed this<br>solar geometry model<br>which shows you that some places in<br>fjordland<br>they never see direct sunlight through<br>the whole year they're in Shadow the<br>whole time<br>these two physical forces combined<br>create large gradients in the types of<br>organic matter available to Consumers<br>available to the marine food web<br>feeding the marine food web<br>now a really nice model for looking at<br>that is is this creature I have a kind<br>of sclerodicus it's sort of the the<br>phenotypic spherical cow and um<br>evokinase chloroticus is a voracious<br>Grazer of kelp<br>and out on the outer Coast where there's<br>tremendous kelp growth big kelp forest<br>ecosystems sea urchins get very very<br>large they're very very fecund and they<br>have lots of very high quality food as<br>you go back into the fjords the organic<br>matter source is available to them<br>change you go from kelp forest to sort<br>of esterine algae all the way back to<br>the inner parts of the fjords where if<br>you took away that sea urchin it would<br>look like the forest floor so this is<br>organic matter coming out of the forest<br>being recycled by bacteria and being<br>made available to kelp not as good of a<br>now that's just opposed against the<br>processes that are driving reproduction<br>you have to be a bit patient to observe<br>Marine populations in the wild and over<br>about nine years we studied<br>um sort of 20 to 23 different sites down<br>through fjordland and over on the left<br>there you can see that we've got an<br>average size of sea urchins in a<br>population<br>fecundity is going to scale is the cube<br>of that thing so as you go to the outer<br>Coast towards zero on that axis<br>fecundity is going to go very very high<br>so production of larvae by populations<br>on the outer Coast is going to be huge<br>compared to the interference<br>remember I told you about estra and<br>circulation those larvae are swept into<br>the inner parts of the fjords and<br>settlement of larvae occurs at maximum<br>in the inner sites now this is a real<br>Source sync Dynamic for the population<br>it's just the sort of population that<br>Carl Walters was talking about and when<br>we observe this over time what we've<br>seen is that those populations on the<br>outer Coast that are providing most of<br>the fecundity are seeding populations in<br>the inner fjords and because conditions<br>are so poor in terms of the food in the<br>inner fjords the populations in the<br>interferes are go undergoing crashes<br>they're going undergoing complete<br>mortality events and then recolonization<br>events<br>so that's kind of neat from a population<br>point of view but think about a fishery<br>that's<br>exploiting this population and if you<br>didn't know this you might accidentally<br>fish out a source and you could crash<br>the whole system this happens over again<br>over and over again in our exploitation<br>of marine systems<br>another neat feature about the fjords<br>another neat sort of aspect is that it<br>has a very intact connection between the<br>reluctual gondwanen nothophagus forest<br>and the marine environment this is a a<br>picture<br>of the Camelot River Estuary and just<br>off where that little boat is if you<br>take a dive and go down the slope you'll<br>find that there's a terrific amount of<br>terrestrial material being recycled and<br>made available to the Marine community<br>one of the studies that really<br>highlights this is this sort of<br>charismatic creature this is a this is a<br>hagfish it's a view a<br>500 million year old view of our Origins<br>vertebrate Origins and hagfish live at<br>tremendous density in Fjord systems in<br>the in the Scandinavian fjords you'll<br>find big densities of hagfish and in our<br>fjords you can find<br>crazy density it's a hagfish at high<br>density they become important predators<br>in the system<br>and we call them a fish they don't have<br>any eyes or bones or anything like that<br>but they're important predators of some<br>um this is some work that Rebecca McLeod<br>and I did and what we did is we used<br>stable isotope analysis as a Tracker of<br>that organic matter that percolates<br>through the food web up into the into<br>the consumers<br>we used basic stabilized type analysis<br>but then we also used isotope analysis<br>of some of the the particular fatty<br>acids that are produced by different<br>types of of primary producers<br>and what we found was a was a complete<br>surprise we found that about 51 of the<br>organic matter available to hagfish<br>comes from this little creature which is<br>solomaya parkinsoni now this is a clam<br>that lacks a digestive system<br>they instead have bacteria living in<br>their gills actually internally in their<br>gills and those bacteria oxidize<br>hydrogen sulfide capturing energy and<br>they use it to fix carbon so these are<br>primary producers just like an algae or<br>a plant and they fix carbon that's<br>released from rotting organic matter<br>from the forest this is a con this is an<br>ecological connection between the forest<br>and the Marine system<br>amazing<br>now with a few of these um sorts of<br>studies under our belts<br>um I got invited by Lou Sanson who is<br>then the conservator of Southland dot<br>Conservatory to join this group called<br>The Guardians of fjordlin Fisheries<br>and this was originally an M fish<br>initiative and it was called the<br>Guardians of furland Fisheries M fish<br>dropped it actually and then Ministry<br>for the environment picked it up and<br>then it was called guardian of fuel and<br>Fisheries and the marine environment it<br>was a group made up of commercial quota<br>holders mostly in the cray eight<br>crayfish quota area<br>ewe Representatives Stu Stu bull there I<br>was the Marine Science and environment<br>rep there were recreational fishing<br>representatives and people from tourism<br>and the and the community and our brief<br>was to and we were surrounded by the<br>government<br>our brief was to provide a fisheries and<br>and conservation plan for fjordland we<br>were joined for that by Sir Alan Mark<br>and I'll have to say that sir Allen had<br>a had a big hand in in<br>providing us with with guidance<br>we provided this to government and our<br>local MP Pete Hodgson at the time who<br>also happened to be the minister of<br>Fisheries really championed this in<br>Parliament it was passed as the fjordlin<br>Marine management act in 2005 and this<br>act<br>closed all of the inner regions of<br>fjordlin to commercial fishing so only<br>recreational fishing in these relatively<br>low productivity areas in the inner<br>regions about 55 59 percent of the Fjord<br>area was closed there and there were<br>some recreational fishing regulations<br>that went along with this to sort of<br>reduce the take in the interviewers<br>reduce the pressure on on interfered<br>populations along with some Fisheries<br>closures so doubtful sound and Milford<br>Sound the the blue Cod fishery in there<br>was closed for a period of time<br>in addition there were eight new Marine<br>reserves set up in fjordland and those<br>joined the the two existing reserves<br>there was one at the gut in doubtful<br>sound and part of Milford Sound this<br>brought the area in the fjords that were<br>under Marine reserve to 13. 13 and a<br>half percent so areas of Refuge for<br>populations living in those areas in<br>those furs<br>now in anticipation of this<br>we started a monitoring program and<br>developed about 50 sites 50 long-term<br>monitoring sites down to fjordland and I<br>have to say I was I started writing down<br>names of people in Doc and the<br>University of otago that helped with<br>this program and I ran out of space way<br>before I ran out of names so there were<br>a lot of people who came and helped us<br>with these monitoring chips that<br>occurred between 2002 and 2010 and what<br>we did is we tried to estimate the<br>abundances of some of the exploited<br>species that are in the system but also<br>some of the fragile rock wall<br>invertebrates things like red corals<br>black corals and of course sea urchins<br>of kelp those sorts of things<br>recently we've done an analysis of a<br>couple of the exploited species this<br>paraproces coleus blue Cod and and also<br>rock lobsters and found that within<br>Marine reserves there have been some<br>remarkable improvements if you look at<br>the top graph there you can see that on<br>the far side the new Marine reserves<br>there's been a significant increase in<br>the relative abundance of rock lobsters<br>and those populations are increasing<br>towards the high abundances that you<br>find in the old established Marine<br>Reserves<br>in the new in the areas that are fished<br>um not much is happening<br>blue Cod on the other hand the reserves<br>are acting more as a staving off decline<br>so in the two areas that are fished we<br>can see significant declines in the<br>areas that are under Marine reserves the<br>surprising if you stop killing them they<br>get more of them most of the time<br>the interesting thing is that not only<br>do you get more you get a more mature<br>population<br>so remember I told you that fecundity of<br>Rock Lobster scales with their size we<br>looked at the sizes of rock lobsters in<br>the new set of marine reserves and using<br>a my system of parallel lasers we were<br>able to actually measure size of rock<br>lobsters without ever touching them you<br>can see at the the top graph there on<br>the on the left in the Marine reserves<br>the the dark bars are are females of<br>different sizes and in the commercial<br>exclusion zones and open fishing areas<br>there are many few are females if you<br>translate those size distributions into<br>potential fecundity what you find is<br>that there's about eight times the<br>fecundity in the Marine reserves as<br>outside on average<br>now if you're quick with your products<br>you'll notice that 8 times 13 and a half<br>is 108 so there's a potential in this<br>system for that thirteen and a half<br>percent of the area to double the<br>reproductive output a potential<br>so it shouldn't really be a surprise<br>that in the years since the fjordian<br>management Act the commercial quota in<br>the system has almost doubled<br>now that's worth a lot of money to the<br>fishery it's the most valuable fishery<br>in new Coastal fishery in New Zealand<br>it's also a population that sits at the<br>headwaters or the the start of the<br>Southland current so it potentially<br>seeds populations all the way around<br>through the different fisheries<br>management areas in fjordland<br>very valuable population this increase<br>has also resulted in increases in the<br>ability to catch Rock officers in the<br>interferes and and increased increased<br>recreational Fishery<br>now in an ecological sense it's also<br>brought<br>a large predatory omnivore into<br>kelp forest systems this is ecologically<br>very important because predators and<br>omnivores play an important role in kelp<br>forest ecosystems<br>we've done an additional analysis on the<br>communities of reef fish that live in<br>these systems using the same data and<br>what we found is that within the Marine<br>reserves they've stabilized trophic<br>level while traffic level has been<br>declining in the in the other fish<br>regions so here and in some of the<br>Marine reserves we've seen those big<br>predators those big large-bodied<br>predators and omnivores come back into<br>the system and they're more stable<br>Through Time<br>now this is a pattern that's occurring<br>globally if you look in science and<br>nature you'll find articles like the<br>trophic downgrading of planet Earth and<br>loss of big predators through the<br>systems and it's something that<br>ecologists are really concerned with<br>we're concerned with what the role of<br>some of these large Predators it is in<br>in systems and what are the consequence<br>for loss of these large predators<br>now one of the things that people have<br>focused on is that large predators in<br>some systems are important vectors for<br>nutrients<br>there's some really neat ecological<br>stories coming out for example in in<br>British Columbia in the Pacific<br>Northwest salmon migrating up Rivers can<br>produce up to 50 of the nitrogen for the<br>surrounding forests so they fertilize<br>the forests<br>answering an age-old question about what<br>bearers do in the woods<br>the largest<br>migration of life on Earth occurs at a<br>daily basis between the Deep scattering<br>layer of the oceans and the surface so<br>daily<br>huge numbers of organisms move across<br>depth strata and in some places in the<br>ocean that can transport a large amount<br>of the nitrogen that moves between the<br>upper mixed layer and the Deep Twilight<br>Zone of the ocean<br>closer to home these are our little<br>endemic snares crested Penguins they can<br>in their foraging bouts gather lots of<br>nutrients lots of the vital nutrients<br>that that fuel islands that fuel<br>productivity on islands and this can<br>extend to areas around those islands<br>now if you think about nutrients in the<br>ocean in New Zealand you have to think<br>about sources so here's a picture of New<br>Zealand and you can see along the coast<br>there's evidence for lots of sort of<br>fresh water coming into the system and<br>terrestrial influences on nutrients into<br>the neuritic waters that surround the<br>coast and this is increasing with our<br>our intense use of the land<br>the water that surrounds the North<br>Island and most of the south island is<br>subtropical Waters and modified<br>subtropical Waters and those waters are<br>generally limit the the nutrients that<br>limit productivity or pelagic<br>productivity productivity of<br>phytoplankton<br>are macronutrients nitrogen and<br>phosphate silicate<br>but below the subtropical convergence<br>which<br>on this picture is depicted by this<br>Cloud Bank where cold water cold<br>sub Antarctic Waters exist it's iron<br>that's limiting pelagic productivity and<br>professors Hunters group in chemistry<br>has been instrumental in pointing that<br>out so below this this feature a feature<br>that by the way might move through<br>climate change there are there are sub<br>Nano molar<br>concentrations of iron and a tiny bit of<br>iron added to the system can stimulate<br>productivity<br>so we've been interested<br>in how Iron is moved around through<br>biological communities and just last<br>week we had this paper published I'm<br>working here with Dave Barr and Melanie<br>Galt Ringgold who are<br>Trace element<br>chemists and also with Olga chatova Lucy<br>Jack<br>and Jim liked her to try to understand<br>how seabirds and marine mammals might be<br>important biological vectors for iron<br>what what's the consequence of these<br>animals being in the system<br>an interesting thing that we found is<br>that iron in the guano and the scat of<br>these animals can reach concentrations<br>that are 100 million times what you find<br>in the mixed layer so there are<br>biological concentrating mechanisms<br>within the food web<br>and interestingly<br>this occurs at the greatest<br>concentrations in the Predators the<br>things that are that are feeding at the<br>top of the food web<br>so these animals potentially could have<br>an important role in how the ecosystem<br>functions not only are they beautiful<br>not only are they important biodiversity<br>but they're a key part of the system<br>now this work occurred down at the<br>Auckland Islands which is<br>quite a Way South it sits at fifth<br>almost 51 degrees latitude in a part of<br>the ocean we call the Furious 50s for<br>good reason<br>and it's it's quite large<br>um 500 square kilometers<br>this island has formed an important<br>refuge for some of our biodiversity as<br>John Waters Group has shown it's been a<br>refuge for yellow-eyed penguins which<br>have now recolonized the mainland it's<br>been a refuge for hooker sea lions that<br>recolonize the mainland this is kind of<br>a longer scale process that's similar to<br>what happens within populations where a<br>refuge can re-colonize different parts<br>of the different parts of the<br>um<br>the range now the the trouble the the<br>sort of worry in the Auckland islands is<br>that while this should be one of the<br>biggest seabird breeding colonies in the<br>Southern Ocean the main island that's<br>central island there<br>is infested with pigs<br>and if you take a walk in the woods and<br>you find some pig scat you'll notice<br>that it's flecked with seabird eggshells<br>and penguin feathers<br>this is something we should do something<br>about this is something we can do<br>something about that would have a big<br>impact on the southern ocean ecosystem<br>we should reclaim that Island as seabird<br>okay further south underneath the<br>Antarctic sea ice where happiness is<br>about a functioning dry suit you'll see<br>that sea ice dominates<br>the ecosystem it dominates the processes<br>that drive productivity and change<br>within the Marine ecosystem and this<br>picture shows quite clearly that little<br>layer of algae growing in The Matrix of<br>the sea ice is a vitally important<br>source of organic matter it only makes<br>about five or ten percent of the overall<br>productivity but it's there all the time<br>that the sea ice is there instead of<br>having a spike of productivity during<br>the summer glut this is a constant<br>source of food for things like<br>overwintering Krill larvae fish larvae<br>those things that need to prepare for<br>that glut of food that occurs during the<br>summer bloom<br>again we use some forensic tools to try<br>to understand how important this organic<br>matter is to the underlying food web and<br>we found that the answer is very<br>within some of the species<br>up to 100 percent or 90 percent of the<br>organic matter feeding these animals<br>comes from sea ice the sea ice microbial<br>Community the community of algae and<br>microbes that lives within the sea ice<br>and this varies with<br>the different foraging<br>strategies of the different fish and and<br>different invertebrates<br>now on our last trip to Antarctica we<br>were<br>treated with this scene at one of our<br>sites<br>um that's a living Antarctic toothfish<br>Living For The Moment anyway and it's<br>about this long it's about a meter long<br>and it's been brought up by his little<br>friend here which is a a wet El seal<br>this is a toothfish are the source of<br>quite a controversial fishery with all<br>seals are are one of the sort of iconic<br>species of the Antarctic and I think<br>this really brings home the the raw sea<br>that area within the Antarctic is really<br>one of the last fully intact marine<br>ecosystems that we have it's one of the<br>places where you can see things like<br>this you never see this in places where<br>the ecosystem would be affected and<br>there's a proposal just now between the<br>United States and and New Zealand to to<br>offer some protection to the Ross sea<br>another controversial thing but<br>certainly something that would be an<br>important step in in preserving<br>um<br>our most southern Marine ecosystem<br>so here we sit near New Zealand in in<br>the wateriest one of the wateriest<br>hemispheres on Earth<br>and<br>our climate<br>our lifestyle our economy are intimately<br>linked with the Marine ecosystem we are<br>a part of the Marine ecosystem that<br>surrounds us we have stewardship for a<br>huge chunk of it going from the raw sea<br>to our extended exclusive economic zone<br>and territorial seas and we're<br>responsible as stewards for nine percent<br>of the earth's surface in terms of of<br>the Marine areas there's tremendous<br>wealth within this Marine estate there's<br>also a potential for sustained wealth<br>within the living parts of this estate<br>so how do we look after nine percent of<br>the Earth's surface you know that's<br>approaching<br>what's in grasslands or fodder crops<br>across the world it's a major chunk of<br>territory<br>the answers are many but one of them is<br>we listen to the organisms that live<br>there and we glean information out of<br>the organisms that live there<br>so here there are organisms that record<br>and provide time series for the physical<br>conditions within the system so this<br>odorless of fish and clam shells and so<br>on we can use forensic chemistry to<br>understand how the environment has been<br>changing through time their key species<br>interactions within the system which we<br>should pay attention to because they<br>indicate how intact how healthy marine<br>ecosystems are<br>they're top predators that offer<br>information as Sentinels for ecosystem<br>change and the state of the system as it<br>is and there's also a historical record<br>that tells us where we are and what the<br>propensity of our system in its current<br>state is for different Futures what<br>choices we can make about it<br>and this offers us a bill an ability to<br>be effective stewards for the southern<br>ocean ecosystem and<br>reap the benefits that it provides<br>well thank you very much Steve uh I<br>think that one of the I wanted to tell<br>you that just a couple days ago Steve<br>said to me I really like a problem<br>and he does you can tell from the<br>diversity of what he's given us here and<br>from his approach to all these different<br>places and all these different animals<br>that what he really is looking for is a<br>problem that he can address and he has a<br>remarkable toolbox available to him that<br>he uses to get to address these problems<br>chemistry and physics and biology and he<br>is I think has shown us how it doesn't<br>matter so much which ecosystem you're in<br>if you're an ecologist you like to get<br>it by the Scruff of the neck and give it<br>a good shake and find out how it works<br>and I think you um will Steve has done<br>an excellent job here of taking us all<br>along on that Voyage of of exploring<br>some of the most magnificent ecosystems<br>in the world and really finding out how<br>they work but you'll notice he doesn't<br>just stop there at the intellectual<br>achievement of that but he says so now<br>what does this mean so what does this<br>mean for fesh what does this mean for<br>for Birds what does this mean for the<br>ecosystem itself and for its future<br>and I think really to cram that all into<br>50 minutes is pretty good work Steve<br>um and um you know that I'd like to take<br>the opportunity now to thank you on<br>behalf of the Department of Marine<br>Science for being a real thinker a<br>furious<br>um a dealer with problems a person who<br>really will cut to the guts of a<br>situation for 17 years it's been great<br>to have you I'd like to thank you on<br>behalf of the Penguins and the seals and<br>even the hagfish for being interested in<br>them even when they're not cute for for<br>really be caring about their future<br>which we can tell you do and I'd like to<br>thank you on behalf of this audience<br>because we've had an amazing hour</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
