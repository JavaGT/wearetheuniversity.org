centre for<br>theology and public issues with the aim<br>of contributing to debate or current<br>issues from a theological perspective<br>this is the first such center in new<br>zealand<br>although there are several others across<br>the world for example in the usa<br>in australia<br>the uk and south africa<br>so we are very excited to have professor<br>bradstock in this position at

the von hergle institute at<br>cambridge where he co-authored a<br>path-breaking and influential report<br>into the church of england and welfare<br>provision<br>previously he spent several years<br>working ecumenically to enable the<br>church's voice to be heard on public<br>issues and he has also been heavily<br>involved in facilitating dialogue<br>between churches and politicians at<br>westminster<br>his research interests include<br>exploration of how faith and politics<br>relate in both contemporary and<br>historical contexts<br>and his latest book completed just a few<br>weeks ago and due out in december is a<br>study of radical religious and political<br>movements in cromwell's england<br>professor bradstark is tonight going to<br>discuss what public theology is<br>and what it is not and the challenges<br>involved in a secular context like new<br>zealand<br>he will offer some thoughts on how we<br>can have a more effective public<br>discussion of such issues<br>it is with great pleasure that i<br>introduce professor andrew bradstock and<br>welcome him to the humanities division<br>thank you very much sue<br>deputy vice chancellor acting pro

to thank<br>my wife helen i'm not going to mention<br>all the reasons i want to thank her<br>except perhaps the main one is agreeing<br>to join me on this adventure<br>particularly leaving behind

other<br>colleagues and friends that i've made<br>around the university since being here<br>there's far too many to mention but i<br>would just like to single out two or<br>three i would like to thank particularly<br>the reverend greg houston the chaplain<br>of the university who's shown me<br>enormous friendship and support in so<br>many practical and indeed spiritual ways<br>since we've been here and also two<br>colleagues who started the same week as<br>i did professor kevin clements and<br>professor liam mcelveen whose friendship<br>and collegiality are also much<br>appreciated<br>also thanks for those who sent messages<br>of support for tonight particularly<br>appreciate those<br>also like to thank the friends that<br>we've made at knox church you've also<br>made us feel very

ours<br>and sarah mitchell and rod mitchell i'm<br>sorry to exclude others from this but<br>you know who you are<br>um just also like to mention um half a<br>dozen people who played a particularly<br>significant role in shaping my thinking<br>over the years and indeed<br>steering me in certain directions during<br>my career i just want to mention my<br>mentor at bristol university when i was<br>an undergraduate dennis turner now in a<br>very distinguished position at yale<br>university who really did set the rudder<br>for much of my research<br>professor david mcclellan at the<br>university of kent who was my phd<br>supervisor<br>peter matheson<br>who i came to work with here back in<br>1990 doing the postdoctoral fellowship<br>that sue mentioned i'm going to mention<br>peter again in a minute<br>um just to warn him um<br>i'd like to mention andre heaton and<br>professor mary gray who were two<br>colleagues of mine at la sant union<br>college in southampton<br>and also professor chris roland at<br>oxford university with whom i've<br>collaborated and who's been also a great<br>friend and inspiration<br>and finally i just want to<br>mention some people of whom it would<br>definitely be true to say that without<br>them<br>i would not be here<br>firstly i want to mention the patterson<br>family<br>obviously i will never know howard<br>patterson but from what i've heard about<br>him from people who did know him i feel<br>very proud to hold a position that bears<br>his name and it has been good to meet<br>his widow lee his brothers greg and<br>grant and his mother june<br>some of whom i see it here tonight<br>and i would like to thank them publicly<br>for their support and indeed for their<br>interest in the work that i've been<br>doing which really is ongoing support<br>i'm going to mention<br>something else that they're involved in<br>a bit later on<br>i'd also like to thank ian and annette<br>tullock also for their enormous<br>generosity<br>in helping to make this position<br>possible it's been a pleasure to meet<br>both of them and talk over and share<br>some of my ideas with them<br>and also last but not least i'd like to<br>thank the presbyterian synod of otago<br>and southland who've also put a<br>considerable amount of support into this<br>position and it's been good to meet the<br>chief executive fergus syme<br>so i would just like to pay tribute to<br>all those and um<br>thank them for for all they've done to<br>make this work possible and the vision<br>that they've had behind putting this job<br>into<br>actuality<br>the second thing i just want to do<br>before i start is<br>mention<br>that an event next week well it's an<br>event that you can make happen if you<br>want um it's a it's a tradition with<br>these lectures that there are no<br>questions and discussion afterwards<br>which i think is rather a shame really<br>particularly if like me you're hoping<br>that you're going to wind people up a<br>bit um so what i've done is i've booked<br>seminar room 4c11 in the arts building<br>the usual seminar room just along the<br>corridor from the theology of religion<br>department at 12 30 on tuesday next week<br>tuesday 8th of june at 12 30 for an hour<br>or so<br>if you want to follow up any of the<br>things that i've been saying this<br>evening do please come along because i<br>would really like to engage in<br>conversation around some of the issues<br>that i want to raise so that's tuesday<br>well it is of course a great honor to<br>be<br>standing here<br>and one which i have in no sense come to<br>terms with<br>in fact when i look back over my<br>career since i left school under a cloud<br>at the age of 16<br>this is hardly the outcome i would have<br>imagined and when i think of my teachers<br>and the others who knew me in my teens<br>and twenties their faces would simply<br>have glazed over in disbelief had they<br>been told that<br>one day i would hold a chair in the most<br>prestigious university in a major<br>commonwealth country<br>my um route to this point has hardly<br>been that of a conventional academic 30<br>years ago at the age of 25 i was just<br>completing my ninth year in a dead end<br>job in a small government office<br>and although by that point i had begun<br>to sense that there might be more to<br>life than 40 years as a civil servant<br>followed by an index-linked pension<br>i had little expectation of building a<br>radically new career<br>even when i negotiated my way into<br>bristol university the following year<br>something i had to do on account of my<br>unorthodox qualifications there was no<br>vocational intent behind my choice of<br>subjects i simply opted for two that i<br>had a passion for theology and politics<br>it was while at bristol however that i<br>conceived the idea of an academic career<br>and i count myself fortunate to have<br>been able to spend a further few years<br>after graduating laying the foundations<br>for that and included in that process as<br>sue has mentioned was a period here in<br>dunedin in the early 1990s<br>when having written a thesis under david<br>mcclellan comparing the 17th century<br>diggers with 20th century priests<br>inspired by liberation theology<br>i took up a postdoctoral fellowship in<br>church history with peter matheson do<br>some work on thomas munson<br>it did not seem in the least strange<br>either to peter or to me that someone<br>should come from england<br>to new zealand to work with a scotsman<br>on a german reformer<br>and nor does it now<br>in order to impose some discipline on my<br>studies i enrolled for a master of<br>theology by dissertation and submitted<br>my research for that degree and i'm very<br>proud to have a degree from otago<br>university<br>one of the things that made my first<br>stay in dunedin so enjoyable was living<br>at knox college under the mastership of<br>the reverend peter marshall and it's<br>been good to renew acquaintance with<br>peter and many other friends from that<br>time<br>through being part of the community at<br>knox i came to understand a little about<br>the new zealand world view<br>about what matters here<br>and what doesn't in particular how few<br>things matter more than sport<br>and how beating australia any form of it<br>matters more than anything<br>humor of course is a major part of this<br>and i've often dined out on one<br>particular incident which took place at<br>knox during my stay there<br>in anticipation of a visit to australia<br>i had acquired the necessary visa form<br>for a uk citizen<br>and a few friends gathered around the<br>dining table to help me fill it out<br>all was going smoothly<br>until i reached the question which read<br>have you ever been convicted of a<br>criminal offence<br>and as my pen hovered over the no box<br>one of my helpful advisers said of<br>course you know what you should really<br>put in there<br>no i said and as one person the group<br>responded oh hell is that still a<br>requirement<br>if i have one regret about this evening<br>it's that neither of my parents has<br>lived to share it<br>i sometimes wonder what they would have<br>made of all this<br>not just because i gave them so much<br>heartache during my time at school but<br>because my mother in particular coming<br>from a family with no history of post<br>compulsory education was firmly of the<br>view that going to university was the<br>kind of thing other people did not us<br>i remember well her discomfort when my<br>sister began a teacher training course a<br>few years before i enrolled at bristol<br>and her attitude i think has<br>encapsulated perhaps in a remark she<br>made when told a few years later that i<br>was to be awarded an m.a<br>i used to think you had to be really<br>if one of the reasons i put myself in<br>the frame for this job was the fond<br>memories i had of dunedin the overriding<br>factor was the challenge of the job<br>itself and the rare opportunity that it<br>offered<br>me to draw on the different experiences<br>i've had over the last 25 years or so<br>one of those has been exploring through<br>research and teaching the history and<br>theory of the relationship between faith<br>and public life and this has led me both<br>back to mainstream and marginal figures<br>in christian history as well as to south<br>africa emerging from apartheid and<br>nicaragua under a revolution inspired by<br>a liberation theology reading of<br>scripture<br>but i've also had considerable hands-on<br>experience particularly during my five<br>years with the united reform church of<br>seeking to articulate the concerns of<br>the church in the public square and of<br>working at westminster to develop<br>conversations between politicians and<br>church people and i do not underestimate<br>the value of this extra academic work<br>this engagement in the arena where the<br>rubber of faith actually hits the road<br>of politics because what this post that<br>i'm in now demands of its holder is not<br>that they spend all their time writing<br>learned theoretical papers about what<br>public theology might be but actually<br>doing it in case murray and paul are<br>looking worried i will spend some of my<br>time writing papers i do have the<br>letters pbrf engraved on my heart like<br>everybody else in the division but but<br>not all of my time it's still early days<br>of course but i believe some useful<br>groundwork has been done over the last<br>16 months i've written and taught some<br>new courses i've given lectures talks<br>and sermons across the two islands<br>initiated a number of research projects<br>begun to attract postgraduate and<br>postdoctoral students<br>and hosted a series of conversations<br>with public figures and creates space<br>for<br>a type of discourse not found elsewhere<br>can i thank you if you've been able to<br>support any of these ventures it's been<br>heartening to see good numbers attending<br>our public events and interest in them<br>and the centre growing<br>and if you aren't yet on the mailing<br>list to receive news of events hosted by<br>the center please email me at the<br>address on this card which you may have<br>picked up on the way in and you can pick<br>up on the way out<br>this is not the place of course for a<br>summary of the past year's activities<br>nor a preview of the centre's future<br>plans<br>what i would say in terms of the the<br>last year is that i valued immensely the<br>opportunity to meet so many people and<br>organizations doing public theology in<br>artero new zealand and in conversation<br>with them begin to ascertain the most<br>appropriate and effective role for a<br>center situated some distance from the<br>seat of power and within an academic<br>rather than an ecclesiastical structure<br>in terms of the future it's good to<br>report that a number of plans are<br>beginning to assume a concrete form<br>in partnership with the sister think<br>tank in the uk we're developing a<br>resource to feed into the forthcoming<br>debate around mmp<br>and with others in dunedin putting<br>together an event to explore the<br>question what makes a good city this<br>ought to prove particularly interesting<br>given the issues with which dunedin is<br>currently grappling and with local body<br>elections on the horizon<br>we're also planning some values-based<br>training for young leaders a project in<br>the area of prisoner rehabilitation an<br>event looking at hymns and social<br>justice with a well-known dunedin hymn<br>writer<br>and a couple of events involving<br>dialogue with members of other<br>faiths finally i'm proud to announce<br>this evening that thanks to the<br>generosity of the paterson charitable<br>trust the first howard patterson<br>memorial lecture will be held later this<br>year and will be given by one of the<br>best known and most effective public<br>theologians around at the moment jim<br>wallace founder and ceo of the<br>sojourners community in washington dc<br>and a member of president obama's inner<br>circle of faith advisors<br>this meeting with jim will be on tuesday<br>the 28th of september and a whole<br>afternoon of events is lined up so do<br>now i guess i need to do something that<br>an engineer or an architect or a<br>historian in this position might not<br>need to do and that is explain what my<br>discipline is<br>theology period<br>we might understand as the study of the<br>nature of god and religious truth and<br>unless we're followers of richard<br>dawkins we might recognize it as a<br>mainstream academic discipline<br>but what does it mean to talk of public<br>theology<br>answering that is not quite as<br>straightforward as one might wish for<br>while the term public theology has only<br>been in use for about three decades it's<br>already attracted a number of<br>definitions and been used in a variety<br>of different ways sometimes even in<br>context where its use has not been<br>explained<br>as leading u.s public theologian harold<br>breitenberg writes in an essay published<br>only last month<br>part of the problem lies in the fact<br>that the term public theology can be<br>used quote to refer to a body of<br>literature a form of discourse a way of<br>doing theology and ethics a tradition<br>within the christian church and a field<br>of study<br>however breitenberg does also note that<br>quote most conceptions of public<br>theology overlap in various and<br>significant ways<br>such that it is possible to fashion a<br>consensus understanding and definition<br>of it that is marked by several key<br>features<br>so let me outline briefly what i see as<br>those key features<br>let's start with a good working<br>definition<br>public theology involves inputting<br>constructively to contemporary discourse<br>in the public square drawing upon the<br>insights of the faith which it offers as<br>gift to the secular world<br>public theology involves inputting<br>constructively to contemporary discourse<br>in the public square<br>drawing upon the insights of the faith<br>which it offers as gift to the secular<br>world<br>i think this captures its essence pretty<br>well but let me<br>expand on it a little<br>first what do we mean by the term public<br>square<br>traditionally this might have been a<br>physical public space where people<br>gathered to discuss the issues of the<br>day the agora perhaps of the greek<br>city-state<br>today we conceive of this square<br>rather more abstractly perhaps using<br>something like the definition charles<br>taylor employs in his magnificent book a<br>secular age<br>of quote<br>a common space in which the members of<br>society are deemed to meet through a<br>variety of media print<br>electronic and also face-to-face<br>encounters<br>so taylor suggests our public square<br>today is the world of newspapers tv<br>radio and increasingly the internet the<br>blogosphere<br>the twitter drone whatever<br>though taylor stresses we can still talk<br>of a common sphere in the singular<br>quote because although the media are<br>multiple as well as the exchanges which<br>take place in them<br>they are deemed to be in principle into<br>communicating<br>taylor goes on to say the discussion<br>we're having on television now takes<br>account of what was said in the<br>newspaper this morning which in turn<br>retal reports on the radio debate<br>yesterday and so on<br>now taylor of course betrays the culture<br>out of which he is writing<br>and i have to say that the public square<br>here in new zealand seems rather more<br>confined than in countries like the usa<br>and my own<br>coming from the uk i cannot help but<br>observe how for example the absence of a<br>choice of daily or sunday newspaper<br>seriously limits the space for public<br>debate notwithstanding the very high<br>standard of comment and analysis offered<br>by our own odt<br>as does perhaps even more seriously the<br>virtual absence on free-to-air tv of<br>programs devoted to serious discussion<br>of current affairs<br>such news programs as are available on<br>these channels seem to want to entertain<br>often more than enlightened and to work<br>on an assumption that viewers are<br>incapable of absorbing anything longer<br>than a 10 second sound bite<br>in marked contrast i have to say to the<br>fair provided by national radio<br>i do think there are serious questions<br>to ask about the reduced space for<br>debate in this country and the apparent<br>lack of appetite for any debate<br>and the consequence of this for the<br>effective functioning of democracy<br>as has been suggested to me there is<br>much that the popular media could learn<br>from the model of the mirai in terms of<br>facilitating genuine and constructive<br>discussion<br>second what does it mean to talk about<br>drawing upon the insights of the faith<br>to contribute constructively to public<br>theology to public discourse<br>here we get to the nub of what it means<br>to do public theology what resources do<br>we have<br>what authority<br>do we accord these resources and how are<br>they to be used<br>i would want to argue that an authentic<br>christian public theology will be<br>informed by both the hebrew scriptures<br>and the new testament<br>recognizing both as disclosing<br>information about the nature of god and<br>the nature of god's dealings with and<br>purposes for humanity<br>public theology will be informed by many<br>other sources as well<br>it can hardly contribute effectively in<br>the public square without drawing upon<br>the insights of other disciplines for<br>example<br>and it goes without saying that it will<br>use the wealth of social teaching in<br>both the catholic and protestant<br>traditions<br>but the character of its work the<br>principles upon which it is predicated<br>must emerge from an honest and open<br>engagement with the texts upon which the<br>christian faith is grounded<br>any other approach it seems to me leaves<br>us making it up as we go along<br>and while such a process will also lead<br>to creative and constructive<br>contributions to the public square<br>it cannot qualify as theology<br>but this whole area is hugely<br>problematic hell we might ask can<br>writings emanating from disparate<br>communities scattered around the middle<br>and near east over a period of several<br>centuries have anything relevant to say<br>to 21st century new zealand or indeed<br>the wider global community and why<br>should it be thought necessary that they<br>should<br>in contrast to those confessional<br>positions which understand texts<br>contained in scripture to be normative<br>for human conduct and binding on society<br>today<br>public theology rejects the christendom<br>approach which looks for an imposition<br>of judeo-christian values from the top<br>down<br>quite the reverse in fact as my earlier<br>use of the word gift in relation to the<br>insights of the faith suggests<br>public theology does derive from<br>scripture a sense of the value god is<br>perceived to place on human life<br>an understanding that god has as<br>liberation theologians used to call it a<br>preferential option for the poor<br>an appreciation of how a creation<br>perspective can deepen respect for the<br>ecosystem<br>and it will want these insights to<br>inform public discourse contribute to<br>the creation of just and peaceful<br>communities and increase the potential<br>for human flourishing<br>but it will offer them as one<br>contribution alongside others<br>recognizing that the days when theology<br>was the only voice in the public domain<br>are well and truly passed if theology is<br>heard today it must be solely on account<br>of the merit of what it has to say<br>so public theology will not be afraid to<br>engage with the bible<br>recognizing that the god to be<br>encountered there is inherently public<br>in character acting decisively in human<br>history and even identifying with it by<br>taking human flesh<br>it will argue that a doctrine such as<br>the trinity has inescapably social<br>implications<br>both in the sense that god in becoming<br>human offers a model of social<br>engagement and incarnation and that god<br>in god's self is characterized by<br>community dialogue and interaction<br>to develop for a moment the theme of<br>incarnation the gospel accounts of the<br>ministry of jesus form an important<br>resource for public theology offering<br>suggestive insights into how it might<br>shape its praxis<br>from the outset jesus makes plain his<br>intent to bring good news to the poor<br>the imprisoned and the oppressed<br>and then fleshes this out as he<br>challenges individuals about their<br>priorities with respect to money and<br>possessions<br>embraces and heals those ignored and<br>disdained by respectable society<br>affirms the peacemaker the merciful and<br>the meek attacks the extortion and the<br>profiteer<br>challenges selfishness and corruption in<br>high places<br>and announces and anticipates the coming<br>of the kingdom by offering an<br>alternative model for social<br>relationships grounded in love<br>the hebrew scriptures which informed<br>jesus ministry highlight similar themes<br>of relevance to public theology in<br>genesis for example god is depicted as<br>the author of life the creator of all<br>people in the one image with an equality<br>of status and dignity who are mandated<br>to steward and tend the earth<br>in the exodus narrative god is the<br>liberator from captivity and slavery the<br>one who promises abundant life<br>symbolized by a surfeit of milk and<br>honey in place of exploitation and death<br>in the provision of manner or daily<br>bread in the wilderness god is seen to<br>be fostering among the people a spirit<br>of gratitude for the enough of god's<br>bounty curbing the tendency to seek<br>private gain at the expense of others<br>in instituting the sabbath the jubilee<br>and days of fasting boundaries are<br>placed upon material consumption and the<br>exploitation of the earth<br>preventing an entrenchment of social<br>inequality and ensuring that those<br>temporarily pushed to the margins are<br>drawn back into the community rather<br>than made permanently dependent upon its<br>charity<br>and in recounting how god periodically<br>raises up profits to speak truth to<br>power the biblical writers emphasize the<br>duty of governments to rule in the<br>public interest to ensure that justice<br>is practiced<br>and to hear the cause of the poor and<br>needy<br>even in these brief references we can<br>discern principles with potentially<br>wider applicability than their original<br>context<br>narratives which can prompt us to ask<br>uncomfortable questions about for<br>example<br>our attitude to the planet and the<br>created order<br>about the purpose of our market activity<br>and the interest that our economy might<br>be thought to serve<br>about the value we place on human life<br>and criteria we employ when according<br>respect worth and status<br>questions about what makes for human<br>well-being and flourishing and whether<br>this is to be measured solely in terms<br>of material wealth<br>and about the core values upon which we<br>build our lives our communities and our<br>nation<br>and it's because asking these questions<br>is vital for the health and well-being<br>of a community<br>and because these questions surface all<br>too infrequently in the public square<br>the public theology has the temerity to<br>describe its contribution to that space<br>as both constructive and<br>gift it is not that theology's<br>contribution is always distinctive or<br>different or even original<br>but because it seeks to further not its<br>own interests but in the prophet<br>jeremiah's words the welfare of the city<br>it may be better disposed to ask the<br>difficult and the disturbing question<br>than many others<br>at the heart of public theology is a<br>conviction that the insights it can<br>offer are relevant to all humanity and<br>on that basis it offers them in a spirit<br>of generosity<br>two examples may exemplify this<br>depiction of public theology as gift<br>first the truth and reconciliation<br>process established under desmond tutu<br>in south africa after apartheid which<br>sought to enable that country to move on<br>from its past not by trying to forget<br>that past or paper over the deep<br>divisions that were its legacy nor by<br>indulging in recrimination none of which<br>could have laid the foundations for a<br>peaceful and stable future<br>but by seeking to concretize the gospel<br>categories of forgiveness reconciliation<br>and restoration to make available the<br>possibility of new start reflecting the<br>model which jesus himself practiced and<br>promoted<br>and second example the drafting and<br>promulgation by church leaders in the<br>united states in the months leading up<br>to the 2003 invasion of iraq of a<br>workable alternative strategy to<br>invasion one which while taking account<br>of the need to remove the tyrannical and<br>hated regime<br>argued that this could be achieved<br>without the death destruction and<br>destabilization which followed the bush<br>and blair-led invasion<br>and which urged that the longer term and<br>wider geopolitical issues of that region<br>also be addressed<br>had this plan been adopted as it very<br>nearly was how different might the<br>so the point of the rather silly title<br>for this lecture will now i hope be<br>clear<br>what other type of theology is there<br>than a public kind<br>is it possible to read the biblical<br>texts other than as inherently public in<br>their focus<br>is public theology despite its apparent<br>newness as a discipline<br>simply what theology has been about from<br>the start<br>now there's a degree of hyperbole in<br>this of course for theology announces<br>also the possibility of transformation<br>at the individual as well as societal<br>level and places much emphasis on the<br>work of the cross in reconciling sinful<br>men and women with a loving and<br>forgiving god<br>but public theology does seek to expose<br>the impossibility of defining faith as<br>simply a private matter<br>something which both christians and<br>atheists can for different reasons have<br>a tendency to do<br>and as marian maddox until recently at<br>victoria university points out<br>in one sense public theology arose as a<br>reaction to the privatization of faith<br>that had become so much a feature of<br>late 20th century religious practice<br>jim wallis i think gets the balance<br>right<br>when he defines faith as always personal<br>but never private<br>this is not the place for a detailed<br>critique of private religion<br>but it's almost exclusive focus on<br>rescuing souls for heaven and it's the<br>focus itself that worries me more than<br>the actual activity can promote a<br>profound indifference to the affairs of<br>this world<br>a tendency which i believe renders it<br>highly unorthodox<br>it is not just that it plays down the<br>public consequences of a faith position<br>how one might ask can one loved one's<br>neighbor in today's global village<br>without asking questions about the rules<br>of global trade the status of refugees<br>or the impact of global warming<br>it overlooks it seems to me the fact<br>that the god we encounter in scripture<br>seems less passionate about religious<br>activities like worship asking only that<br>it be rooted in the practice of justice<br>than what goes on in the hurley burley<br>of everyday life where the hungry need<br>to be fed and those at enmity reconciled<br>private theology's implicit assumption<br>that there are as it were two histories<br>in progress<br>one in which souls are being rescued for<br>a far off heaven the history that god is<br>really interested in and the mundane<br>world of terrorist attacks and economic<br>downturns and famines and unemployment<br>and rising sea levels and nuclear<br>holocausts<br>seems to fly in the face of orthodox<br>belief that it is into that mundane<br>history that god became incarnate<br>neither scripture nor the creeds of the<br>church suggest that it is our destiny to<br>live forever in the world beyond<br>as an alternative i suppose to the even<br>worse fate of being left behind<br>since it is this world<br>that is waiting with eager longing to be<br>set free from its bondage to decay as<br>some paul says it put it puts it<br>it is here on this earth that we pray<br>for the kingdom to come and god's will<br>to be done as in heaven<br>and it's from this world that according<br>to the writer of revelation<br>god will fashion a new heaven and a new<br>earth<br>and that's why the resurrection which<br>still lies at the heart of the church's<br>creeds is so central to public theology<br>whatever actually happened on that first<br>easter sunday and without there having<br>been as bishop tom wright puts it an<br>event that actually occurred in some<br>sense in time and space christianity<br>makes no sense either as a phenomenon or<br>a praxis<br>the resurrection speaks of the eruption<br>into history of the kingdom of the<br>future momentarily into the present<br>if as right says we understand the<br>resurrection as quote only what we call<br>a spiritual event either involving jesus<br>being alive now in some heavenly realm<br>or simply involving a new sense of faith<br>and hope in our minds and hearts<br>the only events that will follow are<br>various forms of private spirituality<br>but what in fact the writers of the<br>gospels and acts present is a challenge<br>to concretize now the radical themes of<br>peace justice and inclusion that are at<br>the heart of the kingdom<br>to do in other words some serious public<br>theology<br>all of which leads us back to what you<br>might think is the elephant in the<br>living room this evening<br>namely how to make sense today of the<br>resources upon which public theology<br>wants to draw<br>as i have already hinted<br>public theology does not suggest that<br>systems of government or economic<br>principles drawn from the practice of<br>ancient nomadic communities can be<br>applied without reserve today<br>it does not suggest that quoting bible<br>verses in itself will cut any ice in<br>public debate<br>or carry any weight with opinion formers<br>or policy makers but as i have also<br>hinted it does believe that serious<br>engagement with these texts and a<br>commitment to relate them to our<br>specific context can provoke penetrating<br>and incisive questions<br>challenge accepted norms and nudge<br>contemporary debates in unexpected and<br>creative directions<br>believing that they address human and<br>social concerns common to all periods of<br>history public theology can draw out<br>principles and insights from these texts<br>which it will seek to feed into public<br>debate<br>so for example with respect to the<br>global economic crisis a topic on which<br>i've been invited to write and speak a<br>good deal in the past 12 months we could<br>say with u.s theologian walter brugerman<br>that while the specifics of the current<br>market collapse are peculiarly modern<br>biblical perspectives are pertinent<br>because the fundamental issues of<br>economics are constant from ancient to<br>contemporary times constants he says<br>such as credit and debt loans and<br>interest and the endless tension between<br>the haves and the have-nots<br>and this would apply i would argue with<br>respect to issues across the board from<br>the privatization of prisons to<br>foreshore and seabed legislation from<br>carbon emissions trading to last month's<br>budget<br>and also with respect to global issues<br>like for example the war on terror and<br>the work of our provincial<br>reconstruction team in afghanistan<br>public theologians in the united states<br>like jim wallis are currently urging<br>their president to place more emphasis<br>on development rather than combat in<br>tackling terrorism in afghanistan<br>highlighting in the process the prophet<br>micah's assertion that it is only when<br>people are able to sit under their own<br>vines and under their own fig tree only<br>when they have a stake in their society<br>such that none can make them afraid that<br>they will beat their swords into<br>plowshares and their spears into pruning<br>hooks<br>in fact there are really two elephants<br>in the lecture theater tonight and the<br>other relates to the final part of the<br>definition of public theology i offered<br>earlier<br>even allowing that it is possible to<br>offer as a gift to the secular world<br>insights drawing on the resources of the<br>faith<br>what grounds are there for thinking that<br>the secular world will listen<br>how can public theology get a hearing in<br>a self-consciously secular society like<br>new zealand<br>there is i think some confusion about<br>what secular means and as roman williams<br>helpfully points out secularism comes in<br>two guises<br>one which seeks to exclude and privatize<br>religious faith as much as possible<br>which he labels programmatic secularism<br>and another which he calls procedural<br>secularism which seeks to allow all<br>faith perspectives and none equal access<br>to the public realm but to confer no<br>privilege on any<br>this latter type of secularism of course<br>has its roots in the judeo-christian<br>tradition which by asserting that only<br>god was sovereign challenged the<br>pretence of a caesar or a pharaoh to be<br>the source of ultimate truth<br>but even if if in this post-cold war<br>period procedural secularism is what we<br>find in most contemporary societies<br>including our own<br>there is still a widespread view that<br>religious language has no place in the<br>public arena that public discourse to be<br>truly public must employ language<br>principles and reasoning which are<br>intelligible to any reasonable person<br>and based on public canons of validity<br>so for example a term like sanctity of<br>life must be ruled out of court because<br>it embraces the concept of holiness<br>which can only be conferred upon<br>something by god<br>and it's equally unacceptable to speak<br>of the equal value of all people in<br>terms of their having been created in<br>the image of god<br>those familiar with the work of rules<br>and beginning and audi and others will<br>know the nuances of this debate<br>but the argument broadly goes that<br>unless religious speakers recognize the<br>need for a common language to exist in<br>the public square they treat their<br>hearers with a degree of disrespect and<br>exclude them from the conversation<br>they treat others as less than equal if<br>they do not adopt the language of common<br>discourse and that severely limits the<br>scope for the kind of contribution i've<br>been arguing this evening that public<br>theology wants to make<br>in brackets it's worth noting if<br>religious people feel aggrieved that<br>this supposed need to disintegrate their<br>beliefs and language<br>if they feel aggrieved at this supposed<br>need to disintegrate their beliefs and<br>language that exactly the same thing<br>happens in reverse in the usa where no<br>person serious about holding political<br>office dare leave god language out of<br>their speeches whether or not it<br>reflects their personal beliefs<br>having said all this there are signs<br>more recently of a shift in the tone of<br>this debate<br>not least as against all expectations<br>religion has burst back onto the scene<br>and been perceived as having something<br>useful to contribute to debates<br>as the title of the new book by john<br>michaelthwaite and adrian wardridge<br>which was discussed on kim hill a couple<br>of weeks ago has it<br>god is back<br>and what they these authors call the<br>global revival of faith which stretches<br>from africa to latin america<br>to perhaps most surprisingly of all<br>china<br>can no longer be ignored<br>not every aspect of this so-called<br>revival of faith is of course positive<br>but it is increasingly hard to ignore<br>the challenge this variety of religious<br>voices present as they reverberate<br>around the contemporary public square<br>paul valerie sometime adviser to bob<br>gerdoff has concluded that the key<br>question today<br>is whether we can create quote something<br>positive and healthy from this crucible<br>or whether we are sleepwalking into an<br>age of confrontation and blind<br>defensiveness<br>we do need to do something more than<br>contain or translate that which we fear<br>and do not understand validly rights<br>we need to find a balance which<br>maintains the secularist separation of<br>church and state but which allows the<br>thinking and acting of religions to play<br>a part in shaping the post-atheist<br>culture which is forming all around us<br>it is the search for a new political<br>language and it is a massive and vital<br>task<br>i suggest we need to recognize the<br>limitations of the requirement that<br>religious people translate what they<br>have to say into some supposed common<br>language and there are of course<br>questions about who determines what this<br>common language is<br>if all voices should be treated with<br>equal respect in the public square so<br>too should all forms of reasoning<br>another weakness of the demand that all<br>public voices adopt a common language is<br>that it tends to close down rather than<br>open up genuine debate<br>surely there is much to be gained by<br>allowing all voices to speak with<br>integrity and candor by allowing for<br>example the full richness of a term like<br>sanctity of life to deepen ethical<br>debates rather than insist that it be<br>translated into some sort of secular<br>esperanto and lose its cutting edge<br>and not that it's just religious people<br>who need to hide their working when<br>entering the public square<br>as jonathan chaplin writes in a<br>stimulating new monograph secular<br>reasons are no more or less tribal than<br>religious ones and grounded just as much<br>in hidden contestable assumptions such<br>as the moral autonomy of the rational<br>individual or the sovereign will of the<br>people<br>all of which makes very timely validi's<br>assertion that we need a new public<br>discourse one which allows space for all<br>engaged in the public square to<br>articulate the deeper convictions<br>underlying their language<br>as stephen heap has put it this would<br>result in a level of public discourse in<br>which quote truth and truth claims are<br>dealt with without ridicule but with<br>deep acknowledgement that we disagree at<br>times profoundly so and yet somehow have<br>to survive together on the same plot of<br>land<br>creating such properly secular spaces<br>heap concludes is a major challenge to<br>which we must rise if our conflicting<br>allegiances are not to tear us apart<br>of course the purpose of confessional<br>candor must not be simply to enable all<br>to parade their deepest convictions for<br>its own sake the point is to add to the<br>quality of public debate to contribute<br>more effectively to the welfare of the<br>city<br>so let me end with an example of how a<br>new type of conversation might benefit<br>us here in new zealand taking as a case<br>study one which i plan to develop in the<br>winter lectures i've been invited to<br>give in auckland and wellington later<br>this year on behalf of the university<br>almost everyone agrees that the size of<br>our prison population is too high and<br>rising too fast<br>while the rate of reported crime<br>actually fell between 2004 and 2008<br>the rate of imprisonment over that same<br>period rose by more than 20 percent<br>in cost terms alone this is worrying<br>the department of corrections saw a real<br>increase in its spending over that<br>period of 64<br>and it currently costs around 250<br>dollars per day to keep someone in<br>prison<br>but the trends at work here and our<br>apparent concern more with treating<br>symptoms and causes suggests the need<br>for a very serious and wide-ranging<br>debate<br>the sort of debate we need however will<br>not take place while the issue of crime<br>and punishment remains a hot political<br>potato<br>while policy is made less on the basis<br>of evidence than in response to popular<br>perceptions about the situation<br>the absence of space for informed public<br>debate to which i alluded earlier does<br>not help<br>and while the media can hardly be blamed<br>for wanting to attract audiences by<br>giving full coverage to major crime<br>stories<br>the fact that a similar amount of time<br>and space is not accorded to seriously<br>debating the underlying issues and most<br>comment reduced to 15 second sound bites<br>clearly is unhelpful<br>were this issue to be taken out of the<br>political arena as has happened in for<br>example finland<br>a debate informed by a confessional<br>candor might be possible<br>away from the glare of the media and<br>without the temptation to place<br>popularity above conviction<br>a spirit of genuine openness could<br>prevail with beliefs and philosophies<br>shared and a consensus to meet agreed<br>targets reached<br>this approach is hardly original we<br>already have a political consensus<br>around for example our non-nuclear<br>stance funding for superannuation the<br>importance of the treaty<br>and there would appear to be much merit<br>in extending it to an issue like the one<br>i have suggested<br>i do not suggest for a moment that any<br>of this would be easy either getting<br>agreement for a bipartisan approach or<br>finding any sort of consensus once it<br>happened<br>these issues are complex for example<br>rates of serious crime are increasing at<br>alarming levels<br>and tough measures are clearly necessary<br>in many cases<br>but at the other end of the scale the<br>suitability of prison in the case of<br>other crimes needs to be considered in<br>the light of evidence as does our very<br>high rate of recidivism<br>and the potentiality of a restorative<br>approach to help people make a fresh<br>start after release<br>but the difficulties involved in finding<br>a solution to this should not prevent us<br>trying<br>and theology which would have much to<br>say on all these issues should be among<br>the voices drowning out those counseling<br>despair<br>and call instead for vision<br>if theology is about anything it's about<br>hope and faith<br>which the writer of the hebrews calls<br>the assurance of things hoped for the<br>conviction of things not seen<br>or as jim wallis puts it believing<br>despite the evidence and then watching<br>the evidence change<br>in fact if there's one sentence that<br>sums up what public theology aspires to<br>be<br>that is probably it<br>well good evening ladies and gentlemen<br>my task is to thank professor bradstop<br>for his lecture a task to which i will<br>shortly turn but let me on behalf of the<br>department of theology and religion also<br>add my thanks to you for your attendance<br>today and for your interest in the<br>notion and in the practice of public<br>theology<br>it is of course hard to do public<br>theology without a public to engage with<br>so your presence is rather important<br>in one of the public conversations<br>hosted by the center to which andrew has<br>referred our deputy prime minister the<br>honourable english<br>was asked about how his own christian<br>faith shaped his political life<br>bill english replied that his catholic<br>upbringing had alerted him to the deep<br>wells of wisdom that are available in<br>the biblical tradition<br>he argued that that wisdom has a great<br>deal to offer in today's social and<br>political environment<br>andrew has sketched for us some of the<br>central strands of that wisdom<br>the wisdom that in spite of its ancient<br>pedigree has a remarkable freshness in<br>today's society<br>is it because it is a wisdom we have<br>forgotten<br>and so to be reminded is to hear it as<br>if for the first time<br>long long ago prophets of israel told us<br>that the measure of a good society was<br>how well it cared for the vulnerable in<br>its midst<br>the widow for instance the orphan and<br>the foreigner<br>it would seem novel now to apply that<br>wisdom to our political arena<br>to test the policies of our social and<br>political life<br>against that measure<br>and to seek new policies if the ones we<br>are following now leave the vulnerable<br>still suffering<br>it would seem novel now to speak of<br>forgiveness in the realm of national<br>and of international affairs<br>it would seem novel to act as jesus<br>parable of the workers in the vineyard<br>commands<br>and pay laborers according to their need<br>rather than according to their just<br>desserts<br>these biblical notions seem novel even<br>in the so-called christian west<br>perhaps because<br>christian theology has not been public<br>enough<br>andrew has pointed out the task of<br>theology the task of attentiveness to a<br>word and a wisdom that we ourselves<br>receive as gift<br>is public by nature<br>no theology worthy of its name can be<br>concerned with any anything less than<br>the whole of god's creation<br>all of us in the department and<br>elsewhere who engage in the discipline<br>of theology<br>are thus public theologians in the sense<br>that andrew has described<br>yet andrew has been charged with<br>establishing a center that has as its<br>primary goal<br>the public consideration of theology's<br>claims<br>andrew you have begun that task very<br>well<br>tonight you have given us a sense of the<br>richness the depth and the scope of the<br>task<br>we thank you for that<br>and we wish you well as she continued to<br>build the center and develop the<br>discipline of contributing<br>constructively to contemporary discourse<br>in the public square<br>drawing upon the insights of faith<br>if as you hope a better conversation is<br>generated in new zealand society<br>we look forward to watching the evidence<br>change<br>andrew we have a gift for you<br>on behalf of the university to<br>commemorate this occasion and as i<br>presented to me please join me in<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
