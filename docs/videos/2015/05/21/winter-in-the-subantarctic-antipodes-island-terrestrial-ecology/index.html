us three<br>days to arrive here on the charter<br>vessel team√∂ a 50-foot yacht and we<br>traveled through Pisces and swell push<br>us all over the place once we arrived<br>here we have to find suitable Anchorage<br>from the Windsors there's no permanent<br>place to anchor that safe on enter<br>Penny's Island the bay behind me<br>anchorage bay is this place for landing<br>and you can see the landing platform<br>which is only exists below low tide on a<br>calm seas day there are times when we<br>have to wait many days for the sea to<br>calm before we are able to land once we<br>arrive it takes a day to carry all the<br>gear off the boat and up to the<br>Hottentot code where we an invasive the<br>remainder of our trip<br>I'm here on sub-antarctic Antipodes<br>Island lying over 700 kilometers<br>southeast of New Zealand in this joint<br>Department of Conservation and<br>University of Auckland expedition we're<br>here to estimate the impacts of proposed<br>Mouse eradication on the islands fauna<br>mice were shipwrecked here over a<br>hundred years ago and have since had<br>major impacts on the islands flora and<br>fauna the proposed million-dollar Mouse<br>eradication campaign will remove mice<br>from this island and restore it to its<br>former state before we can do this we<br>have to undertake baseline scientific<br>studies for the islands ecosystem and<br>the potential impacts of the proposed<br>eradication methodology to do this we've<br>taken a six hectare study area and<br>covered it in non-toxic biomarker bait<br>with a substance called Pyrenean in it<br>paradeen allows us to check which<br>animals are consuming the bait we've<br>found a hundred percent of the mice<br>we've captured have consumed the bait<br>which is necessary for the eradication<br>to be successful we've also been working<br>on the fort land bird species found here<br>the Antipodes island pivot snipe and two<br>species of parakeet the Antipodes Island<br>Park eat and rice Shakspere a--quite<br>which are found only on this island<br>by her knitting as many of these birds<br>as possible we inspect them under UV<br>light where the bio marker shows up and<br>we can see if any of them have consumed<br>the bait making them at risk from the<br>eradication methodology we've found none<br>of these birds have consumed any of the<br>bait at this stage which is really<br>encouraging that the eradication will<br>have a minimal impact on these bird<br>species this is the North Plains<br>interior of Antipodes Island and behind<br>me you can see Mount Galloway the<br>highest point it's in this area that the<br>majority of wandering albatross nest and<br>at this time of year the chicks are<br>being fed about once a week by adults<br>coming in from sea with food for them<br>it's also in this area that we've set up<br>one of our mouths live trapping grits<br>here we have 49 traps set up ten metres<br>apart each and for seven nights we<br>capture all the mice in the area and<br>uniquely mark them with an ear tag these<br>data can then be analyzed using a<br>statistical method designed in New<br>Zealand which estimates the number of<br>mice per hectare which is really<br>important information for eradication<br>managers this is also one of the areas<br>where we've set up pit for monitoring<br>here we have ten pitfall traps spaced 10<br>metres apart with a mixture of glycol in<br>them these are used to attract and verda<br>Ritson to them so that we can count the<br>biodiversity of these species and use<br>this as a baseline for ecosystem<br>recovery after the eradication the<br>Castaway Depot was placed at revision<br>sailors shipwrecked on the island in the<br>past it was also when mice were first<br>detected on the island in 1909 today<br>we're using the castaway Depot as a<br>makeshift laboratory where we can<br>perform our autopsies on dead mice to<br>ensure 100% bait uptake of the bait<br>marker that will spread across the<br>island we're also using this laboratory<br>to collect samples across the entire<br>food chain to analyze the community<br>dynamics of the island by sampling<br>plants insects and animals we can look<br>at the ratio of isotopes of carbon and<br>nitrogen in these different specimens<br>these ratios give an indication of how<br>far up a food chain and individual is as<br>well as how much marine influence there<br>is in its diet we can use these to<br>reconstruct the food web of the island<br>and use this to predict changes that<br>will occur after eradication of mice<br>this is the captive facility where we've<br>been keeping parakeets on the island<br>we've been going around the area where<br>we spread the biomarker and capturing as<br>many parakeets as possible which we<br>predict may be vulnerable to the<br>eradication methods proposed for mice on<br>the island by capturing as many of the<br>two species of parakeets as possible we<br>take measurements from them which can be<br>used for features such as predicting the<br>sixes of them as well as confirming if<br>any bait has been consumed for which<br>we've found no sign so far a selection<br>of the healthiest parakeets were then<br>placed in these cages and used to test<br>how well they respond to captivity a<br>number of parakeet species already kept<br>in captivity on the mainland so we don't<br>predict any major effects of this the<br>parakeets were kept in the facility for<br>ten days and then we released them to<br>make sure they could return to the<br>environment normally this was undertaken<br>to ensure if necessary a backup<br>population of parakeets could be<br>established during the eradication and<br>released afterwards to restock the<br>island<br>you</p></main><footer
