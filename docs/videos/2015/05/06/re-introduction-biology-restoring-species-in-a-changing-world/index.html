university<br>of otago and it is my great pleasure to<br>be here with you this evening for this<br>inaugural professorial lecture<br>it is really fantastic to see so many<br>people in the audience<br>and you know that we've actually reached<br>capacity and we have folks next door who<br>are watching this on live stream<br>and i think that's really an indication<br>about<br>the popularity of this particular<br>professor<br>as well as the community interest in his<br>area of research<br>so on behalf of the university i would<br>like to welcome<br>family friends<br>academic and general staff and members<br>of the dunedin community who have joined<br>with us this evening to celebrate<br>now as you know in order to be promoted<br>to the rank of professor here at the<br>university of otago an academic staff<br>member must demonstrate excellence in<br>teaching in research<br>and in service<br>but against that backdrop of excellence<br>there are a few things that stand out<br>particularly<br>for any given individual<br>and in terms of professor sudden's<br>portfolio there are two things that i<br>would like to highlight for you this<br>evening<br>first he is obviously a gifted graduate<br>student supervisor<br>at the time that he was promoted to this<br>position he had supervised 12 phd<br>students to completion and he was<br>currently supervising seven more<br>he had also supervised 20 master's<br>students to completion and he had three<br>additional master's students in progress<br>and not only has he successfully<br>supervised these students in order to<br>gain their degrees but along the way he<br>has also helped them to publish the<br>products of their research<br>now many of the senior people who are in<br>this audience this evening and certainly<br>the people who are sitting down here<br>that commitment to graduate student<br>research i think resonates with each and<br>every one of us<br>professor sadden seddon's passion for<br>postgraduate supervision<br>is something that i particularly<br>empathize with<br>and for many of us in this audience this<br>evening it was the opportunity to<br>supervise postgraduate students that<br>actually drew us to this profession in<br>the first place<br>and for those of us who now have<br>different kinds of jobs it is the one<br>thing that we continue to jealously<br>guard<br>in amongst the midst of our other<br>administrative responsibilities<br>but i think most importantly for the<br>postgraduate students in this room and i<br>suspect that there are a large number of<br>you<br>i'm sure that you will agree<br>that there is no more valuable resource<br>during the course of your graduate<br>career than having a smart energetic and<br>highly committed supervisor and i'm sure<br>that professor stu said and students who<br>are here in the audience this evening<br>will agree that they have been<br>extraordinarily privileged to have the<br>opportunity to work with him<br>now the second thing i want to highlight<br>about his career<br>is that professor sudden has also made a<br>very concerted effort to translate his<br>outstanding science into practice<br>and in the field of the reintroduction<br>of reintroduction biology he has<br>published a number of key papers<br>book chapters and books<br>but more importantly perhaps he has<br>produced a framework for the<br>reintroduction of endangered species<br>that is fast becoming the<br>internationally recognized best practice<br>in the field<br>at atago we are extremely proud of the<br>academic caliber of our professoriate<br>but we are also extremely proud of<br>people like professor sutton who<br>actually make an effort to solve<br>real-world problems not only here in new<br>zealand but around the world<br>so on behalf of the university of otago<br>i would like to warmly congratulate<br>professor sudden on his promotion to<br>professor and i would now like to invite<br>professor keith hunter the pro vice<br>chancellor of sciences to tell us a bit<br>more about his path to this honor<br>thank you vice chancellor and and let me<br>say that this<br>is one of the more pleasurable parts of<br>my job<br>um introducing uh new professors in<br>their inaugural lecture<br>phil seden was born in newcastle upon<br>time<br>uh to kiwi parents who were on their oe<br>but he came back to new zealand when he<br>was only three<br>but by ship in fact and um one of his<br>earliest memories is being terrified and<br>hiding under a table when the ship's<br>crew<br>he was educated in auckland in<br>wellington and then<br>attended otago university from 1981<br>and he completed a bsc honours in 1994<br>and his phd<br>in<br>1988.<br>his ph.d research was on yellow-eyed<br>penguins and<br>his supervisor lloyd davis who's here<br>had the habit of clustering his phd<br>students together in one room so phil<br>was thrown together with yolanda van<br>hezek<br>in<br>a shared office<br>now this predated the days of health and<br>safety or at least serious sales and<br>safety<br>so their shared office doubled his lab<br>and phil had to eat his lunch while<br>yolanda sorted out<br>penguin regurgitation samples<br>i hope you didn't get confused<br>at the end of the phds they both set off<br>to in 1989 for three years of post-op<br>work<br>at the university of cape town in south<br>africa<br>and the south african work also involved<br>penguins but<br>it was distinguished by being the time<br>when south africa was undergoing huge<br>social change and so phil and yolanda<br>were in cape town where nelson mandela<br>was released<br>after 26 years of imprisonment<br>and they joined a huge crowd in cape<br>town to listen to mandela's first speech<br>in three decades<br>and at one point a crazy man with a<br>knife started slashing at the people<br>around them<br>and phil being taller than yolanda could<br>see this knife-wielder coming so this<br>was his hero moment which had arrived at<br>last<br>and he seized yolander and attempted to<br>pull it backwards to safety<br>the problem was that he was wearing<br>jandals<br>and so he slipped over and to this day<br>despite this misunderstanding<br>a job offer from the middle east came up<br>for phil<br>and that necessitated a quickie wedding<br>which was held in the windberg district<br>court uh in south africa<br>with as he's described three guests and<br>wedding photos surrounded by posters<br>so during nine years in saudi arabia<br>phil and ulanda worked together in the<br>vast desert protected areas<br>there and were involved in restoration<br>programs for species such as<br>the arabian oryx<br>so in 2001 with a young son added to the<br>family phil and yolanda returned to new<br>zealand to take up a shared position at<br>the university of otago in the<br>department of zoology<br>and<br>at the same time he took up the<br>directorship of the wildlife management<br>program<br>so phil congratulations from me on your<br>ritually deserved promotion to professor<br>and i now invite you to present your<br>thank you keith vice chancellor and<br>thank you everyone for coming and<br>sharing this time with me<br>a very close friend of mine who's not<br>part of the university was<br>congratulating me on this promotion they<br>said oh now you're a professor<br>what what's the difference does it mean<br>you don't have to do any teaching i said<br>well no we do teaching he said well does<br>the university give you a big research<br>grant and i said well no that's it<br>doesn't happen either<br>and he said well what and i had to think<br>about the only difference i could tell<br>one of those committees was in commerce<br>and i went went across there i was<br>really keen to kind of interact with<br>colleagues in other disciplines went and<br>introduced myself to the chair of the<br>meeting and he turned around he said<br>accuse me of being an animal racist<br>and it turns out this was because i<br>privileged things like native species<br>like kiwi and kakapo over introduced<br>species like<br>possums<br>my immediate response was to threaten to<br>go out and set some possum traps but in<br>the wider sense i think it says<br>something interesting i think we<br>are losing sight generally about what's<br>native what's not what's supposed to be<br>here what what shouldn't be here what's<br>an invasive species<br>we're starting to become alienated from<br>the natural world that kind of sits<br>around us<br>and it's it's not surprising really<br>when you consider that<br>uh fairly recently global population<br>mark passed a milestone so that red line<br>is the proportion of the world's<br>population that's in urban areas so<br>there are more people live in cities<br>than in rural areas and the projection<br>is this is only going to get more and<br>more intensified so the darker the color<br>here you can see the more urbanized that<br>area<br>what this does is it moves us into a<br>very artificial environment we're away<br>from<br>the natural world we lose touch with it<br>we become alienated from it<br>in a number of ways<br>it's not helped by the fact that we're<br>losing natural biodiversity we're losing<br>species all the time this rather<br>compelling<br>graphic just recently came out so the<br>lighter the color the more red the more<br>species at risk of extinction in terms<br>of looking at<br>mammals amphibians and bird species so<br>despite decades of traditional<br>conservation action we're not winning<br>that battle<br>what i mean by traditional action it's<br>like creating protected areas and and<br>trying to to preserve species where they<br>are<br>we're losing that battle and we're<br>moving into an era<br>where we need to consider much more<br>intensive kinds of conservation tools<br>and that's what i want to talk to you<br>tonight about<br>so one of those tools out there is<br>conservation translocation so a<br>translocation is really where you move<br>species from one area and you release<br>them in another so a conservation<br>translocation is where you do this for<br>some kind of conservation benefit<br>and a subset of that we could i'll be<br>talking about is reintroductions so<br>reintroduction is where you've lost<br>species from one area of their range and<br>you want to bring<br>translocate them back in there and try<br>and re-establish a population a viable<br>population<br>i also want to embed this in the idea<br>that<br>these kinds of of conservation actions<br>are a way to re-engage people with that<br>their natural heritage<br>we can think about new zealand new<br>zealand's a has the dubious distinction<br>of being a<br>an extinction<br>capital we've lost a lot of species<br>and if you talk to people people say yes<br>of course we've lost more and we lost<br>things like that in two waves of kind of<br>human colonization<br>it's probably not realised just how<br>how<br>urgent how recent how ongoing things are<br>i think in most people's mind we feel<br>that we've we've got over those<br>extinctions we've now got department of<br>conservation uh they're doing lots of<br>good stuff they're dropping a lot of<br>poison out of the air in order to<br>deal with pests<br>so pose a question what was the date of<br>extinction<br>of kakapo on mainland new zealand so<br>kakapo used to be distributed<br>widely across north and south islands we<br>now only have relic population a really<br>small remnant population on a few<br>offshore islands that don't have<br>predators<br>was it 1875 so this is well after kind<br>of organized colonization we had we had<br>stoats we had rats we had cats we had<br>all these sorts of things<br>no it wasn't<br>but we lost the new zealand quail about<br>then<br>what about turn of the century around<br>1900<br>not yet but we'd lost the stevens island<br>ren at that time<br>about just before world war one around<br>world war one<br>so getting into you know nearer history<br>not then but we lost laughing al around<br>that time<br>let's pull it right up close 1965 that<br>certainly within my lifetime<br>surely you know<br>we would have had<br>any losses we were going to get we'd get<br>by then<br>no but we lost the greater short tail<br>bat and this is the only known photo the<br>only photo that was ever taken it was<br>lost so fast<br>so when was it 1987 we lost the last<br>kakapo from mainland in fjordland<br>and this is the last kakapo from<br>fjordland<br>so it's been held by<br>don merton who uh sadly passed away in<br>2011 don was a a pioneer of using<br>conservation translocations<br>reintroductions responsible for saving<br>probably three species of new zealand<br>bird kakapo<br>mine and black robin saddleback<br>i actually first met don<br>when we were both in cincinnati zoo<br>looking at a rather forlorn display of a<br>stuffed pigeon<br>this is martha in its last passenger<br>pigeon<br>martha died almost exactly a hundred<br>years ago today<br>martha's going to play a part in our in<br>the story tonight we'll come back to<br>martha the other thing i note there is<br>this idea of you always name the last<br>few remaining species that you have<br>around so if you're a species an animal<br>like that and someone names you then you<br>and this last fjordland kakapo was named<br>named richard henry kakapo<br>richard henry the kakapo in the end to<br>distinguish him from his namesake which<br>was richard henry so this is an irish<br>immigrant worked in australia in new<br>zealand<br>a keen self-taught naturalist was made a<br>warden of resolution island down in<br>fjordland<br>and he was appalled to see the arrival<br>of stoats invading from their release<br>sites in the east coming into the west<br>area and where the stoats came they<br>started to<br>wipe out the local birds and he took it<br>upon himself to try and save as many of<br>these as he could by catching vast<br>numbers more than 700 kiwi and kakapo<br>which tells you something about the<br>densities they were at and moving them<br>from the mainland to offshore resolution<br>island<br>so a conservation translocation<br>unfortunately stoats invaded resolution<br>it was too close to the mainland they<br>could swim that<br>and and<br>all his work was for nothing all those<br>birds died in the end and heartbroken<br>uh richard henry left resolution never<br>returned there<br>did some other jobs around kapiti but<br>eventually died in an insane asylum in<br>auckland<br>now for a long time i've i've proudly<br>used richard henry as saying this is a<br>first conservation translocation it was<br>in new zealand we're pioneers with this<br>until someone pointed out that around<br>about the same time that richard henry<br>was swatting sand flies in fjordland<br>a man called edward mcelenny<br>who's probably best known for<br>the ubiquitous tabasco sauce<br>he created a wildlife refuge a bird<br>refuge called bird city in louisiana<br>and took it upon himself to try and and<br>rescue from extinction<br>the the snowy egret that was being<br>threatened by trade for feathers for<br>hats<br>and he started kept a breeding program<br>and was releasing them back so he was<br>reintroducing these birds back into that<br>area and probably single-handedly saved<br>saved so these were kind of individual<br>efforts individual people taking upon<br>themselves to do something the first<br>institutional attempt to reintroduce<br>species was with american bison<br>so<br>1905 there was a<br>a society formed the american bison<br>society at bronx zoo<br>this um the image there the black and<br>white image there is a pile of of bison<br>skulls so bison<br>used to occupy the central plains in<br>vast numbers 70 million was was a rough<br>estimate<br>and they were<br>wiped out out to the point that there<br>were fewer than a thousand five hundred<br>and something animals left by the time<br>1905.<br>this was a fairly systematic hunting<br>people were using the meat the skins<br>they ground up the bones for fertilizer<br>but that was almost incidental it was<br>actually a an engineered<br>harvest if you like to put pressure on<br>planes indians who were within that area<br>to open up the area for cattle<br>so up to 2.5 million buys in the year<br>we've been killed at one period<br>so the american bison society actually<br>undertook the first institutional<br>reintroduction if you like when in 1907<br>they transported 15 animals from bronx<br>zoo to a release site and that started<br>the restoration of these species we'd<br>jump forward a few decades before re<br>institutional reintroductions really<br>took off<br>so think about the 60s 70s and 80s<br>so golden lion tamarin in brazil<br>the peregrine falcon in north america<br>and the arabian oryx in oman<br>that last one being headed by<br>mark stanley price who became the chair<br>of the world conservation union's<br>reintroduction specialist group and<br>wrote a very influential book<br>there's been a huge<br>range number<br>of species that have been translocated<br>for conservation purposes have been<br>reintroduced this is the tiniest kind of<br>selection<br>so a lot of activity a lot of<br>information out there<br>we can we can summarize this a bit with<br>this figure which has really got two<br>parts so if we look at the graph at the<br>top there<br>those dark bars are species that have<br>been translocated and the pale bars are<br>the proportions of species in nature so<br>what this is telling us is that there's<br>a taxonomic bias in what we choose to<br>work on<br>and there's some other work i did with<br>some colleagues looking at the fact that<br>we tend to focus on birds and mammals<br>the exclusion of other things almost<br>irrespective of their their threat<br>status<br>there's no mystery why this we we do it<br>for conservation research we do it for<br>general research there's a focus towards<br>these things and it's because they're<br>cute<br>you can get public support you can get<br>money you can do things like that<br>second part of this figure<br>is the<br>these arrows these these circles down<br>here which are just telling us uh the<br>proportions so this a little over a<br>quarter of translocations have taken<br>place in australia and new zealand so we<br>really are a kind of a a reintroduction<br>hotspot if you like<br>there's a recent study done that said 55<br>new zealand bird species just thinking<br>about birds<br>have been translocated over a thousand<br>releases this is this is over 60 percent<br>of our our entire ava foreigner has<br>actually been translocated there are<br>some five species that only exist with<br>us now we can only enjoy them now<br>because they've been rescued using these<br>kind of translocations<br>a lot of those early efforts<br>right throughout the world<br>were very much management exercises and<br>they were they were done<br>without a lot necessarily a lot of<br>planning a lot of thought a lot of<br>follow-up actually to actually find out<br>what was going on<br>and<br>with a couple of colleagues so doug<br>armstrong from massey richard maloney<br>who's department of conservation the<br>three of us kind of bridge the gap<br>between research and management and in a<br>couple of papers we were trying to set<br>out a way for what we call developing<br>the science behind reintroductions or<br>really the discipline of reintroduction<br>biology talking about better use of<br>experiments<br>rather than just pure management<br>exercises use of modeling predictive<br>modelling and and thinking about<br>strategic directions actually answering<br>specific questions<br>a lot of the thinking came together in a<br>book a couple of years ago<br>excuse the grainy<br>conference photo on the side there but<br>this is these are the editors we're all<br>either kiwis or new zealand based so<br>doug armstrong john you and me and kevin<br>parker<br>i've been talking a lot about<br>reintroduction<br>the thing about reintroduction is that<br>it's a restoration and then the question<br>is saying well restore to what what is<br>it what's your target state how far back<br>do you go do you go ten thousand years<br>back well a lot of these species just<br>aren't with us anymore<br>what about a thousand years ago<br>what about the changes since then or do<br>you go 100 years ago<br>it's really an arbitrary decision<br>it's not clear in a lot of people's mind<br>everyone thinks well we just want to go<br>back to the state it was before it was<br>when it was pristine when it was wasn't<br>disturbed by humans and that that's a<br>that's a fallacy that there are no<br>pristine states there was never a static<br>state<br>where species distribution stayed still<br>and the environment didn't change<br>so any selection of a<br>historic<br>target state for restoration is<br>arbitrary you can you can do whatever<br>you like but there are some implications<br>when we think about the fact that<br>environments change<br>in a chapter uh with patrick osborne<br>from the uk we we explored though we<br>said what are the implications for<br>reintroductions of this kind of<br>environmental change we came up with<br>four<br>so where things were in the past their<br>historical locations doesn't mean that<br>that is still suitable habitat today<br>where things are now doesn't mean that<br>that's the best place they could be they<br>could be restricted there for other<br>reasons<br>where they're missing so the flip side<br>where they're not doesn't mean it's not<br>suitable there may be reasons why they<br>can't access that area and where they<br>are now doesn't mean it's always going<br>to be good for them we can illustrate<br>that again with uh some examples some<br>new zealand examples so new zealand and<br>exotic predators so this is just the<br>increasing distribution of possums in<br>new zealand<br>the arrival apprentice has changed<br>habitat suitability has changed that<br>environment<br>for species so if we look at<br>distribution maps like this for kiwi<br>and for mohu yellow head<br>the pale blue tells you where they were<br>pre-human so this is from fossil sites<br>the dark blue is where that distribution<br>had shrunk to by about the 1970s<br>and the black is a more recent one<br>and we may have to redraw the map for<br>mohu<br>if we're not careful in the future<br>so just because they were distributed<br>over that large area doesn't mean that<br>those areas are now still suitable for<br>them they're filled with predators that<br>habitat suitability has changed<br>the other extinction hot spots hawaii we<br>look at the distribution and pale here<br>of<br>hawaiian endemics up in these highland<br>areas<br>you could say well that's their<br>preferred habitat they like to be up<br>high but in fact these birds were once<br>distributed right throughout lowland<br>areas that was their preferred habitat<br>but what's happened is introduction of a<br>mosquito carrying avian malaria<br>has changed that habitat suitability and<br>these birds are now restricted to these<br>little upper islands where it's<br>relatively too cool for the mosquito<br>and of course the big one is climate<br>change climate change changes everything<br>especially the rate of change so we're<br>looking here at a very long term record<br>millions of years in the past we can<br>zero in just on more recent<br>so these are not predictions this is<br>data about changes in co2 and changes in<br>temperature<br>so this is fundamentally changing the<br>habitat suitability for species<br>and we need to figure out how to deal<br>with that<br>i explored the implications of some of<br>these in a paper<br>back in 2010<br>and i made the point that i felt we're<br>moving away from the dictates of<br>historical species distribution records<br>towards inclusion of more risky<br>interventions that is moving things<br>outside of where they used to be<br>and i knew this was going to be a bit<br>controversial controversial<br>and you know you're in trouble when your<br>but nevertheless<br>some of these ideas were taken up when<br>the world conservation union<br>revised its guidelines so importantly<br>here we've got guidelines<br>for reintroductions<br>and other conservation translocations<br>and those other conservation trends<br>locations are what we would call<br>conservation introductions<br>so that is moving species outside of the<br>historical distribution range for<br>conservation purposes we can think about<br>a couple of those there cystic<br>colonization and ecological replacement<br>so with some new zealand examples think<br>about what a cystic colonization is<br>that's where habitat suitability changes<br>so much or so fast that species are<br>unable to stay and adapt or unable<br>perhaps because of barriers to move into<br>more suitable habitat elsewhere so you<br>must assist their colonization by moving<br>them from one place to another outside<br>of their distribution<br>so example is the stitchbird or hehe<br>modelling has shown that<br>those remnant populations are only six<br>populations left five of them exist from<br>translocations are at high risk of<br>extinction unless we start to move them<br>away from their traditional or the<br>historical range<br>and with tuatara which has temperature<br>dependent sex determination is very<br>sensitive to ambient temperatures a case<br>has been made for assisted colonisation<br>been talking about species you know in<br>isolation protecting conserving<br>restoring individual species but we can<br>think about the role that some animals<br>play within their environment<br>so this flowchart is really just talking<br>about the effect that that wolves had<br>or have within<br>an ecosystem such as yellowstone so<br>wolves were eradicated from yellowstone<br>national park as a result of that the<br>elk that they preyed on<br>their populations boomed it was<br>overgrazing and there was<br>severe erosion the reintroduction of<br>wolves restored that that balance that<br>natural predator prey process<br>and and restored that ecosystem to some<br>extent that's all very well we had<br>wolves we could put them back what<br>happens though when you've lost<br>something through extinction you've lost<br>one of these ecological engineers you<br>can't just put it back<br>we're talking about ecological<br>replacements that is finding some kind<br>of substitute that you could put back in<br>there<br>to do that same job<br>and the most work around ecological<br>replacements has been in replacing<br>mega herbivores these giant tortoises on<br>ireland systems<br>one of these uh is you see lonesome<br>george so another last individual that<br>got lucky enough to get a name appeared<br>in david attenborough's galapagos<br>program<br>so the loss of tortoises from these<br>profoundly changes that ecosystem<br>because of the way tortoises graze and<br>trample that vegetation<br>with colleague<br>christine griffiths who's done a lot of<br>work in this area we tried to summarise<br>this<br>for round island and mauritius so we<br>started off in a historical setting with<br>tortoises the tortoises became extinct<br>and<br>a series of introductions of exotic<br>grazers and exotic vegetation<br>completely degraded and changed that<br>environment<br>the restoration process involved taking<br>those goats and those rabbits off so<br>these red arrow red areas here taking<br>them off<br>and<br>restoring some of the natural vegetation<br>the the vegetation that should have been<br>there but the trouble is<br>you had ongoing kind of weeding problems<br>the natural vegetation couldn't compete<br>with<br>the the weedy species so by bringing in<br>an ecological replacement a giant<br>tortoise that wasn't originally there<br>to graze that vegetation they've<br>actually been able to restore that<br>habitat to some semblance of of its<br>original form<br>we can summarize all this in thinking<br>about a conservation translocation<br>spectrum<br>so we start off with<br>at the top that black box<br>and we ask<br>the question is the release taking place<br>in within the indigenous range or in<br>that historical distribution<br>if it's yes then what we're doing is one<br>of two things we could be<br>adding individuals to an existing<br>population such as black stilt that<br>would be a reinforcement<br>or adding them into an area where they<br>used to be but are now missing such as<br>frogs or the wolf example<br>if they if you're not putting it into<br>uh back into their indigenous range<br>you're doing a conservation introduction<br>you might be doing an cystic<br>colonization so the example here is the<br>tasmanian devil<br>populations<br>dropping because of devil facial tumor<br>disease so that they've used assisted<br>colonization to create a disease-free<br>population on an island where they never<br>existed and then these ecological<br>replacements<br>ideally you want to keep keep the bits<br>there and extinctions<br>are a loss you can try and find<br>replacements maybe replacements don't<br>exist to be much better to have that<br>original form back<br>and there are some people that suggest<br>so this sort of hit new zealand uh scene<br>because of trevor mallard who's<br>currently fighting for his political<br>career i think 378 votes stand between<br>him and oblivion<br>and he was asked to kind of future think<br>for his electorate why new yormata and<br>he he thought one of the things might be<br>nice to have around for various reasons<br>would be moa and to de-extinct that mo<br>and<br>the<br>the reaction was you know you must be<br>crazy where did this come from you've<br>been reading too much michael crichton<br>or something like that<br>but in fact what<br>what um<br>trevor had been reading was national<br>geographic<br>national geographic has kind of teamed<br>up with<br>a group called the long now foundation<br>headed by stuart brand<br>and stewart has said humans have made a<br>huge hole in nature in the last 10 000<br>years we have the ability now and maybe<br>the moral obligation to repair some of<br>that damage to resurrect species so we<br>have the ability now do we have the<br>ability now<br>well there are three pathways to the<br>extinction the first one is a bit of a<br>cheat<br>what you do is you find a near-living<br>relative<br>so in this case people are trying to<br>resurrect their rock this giant<br>black beast that used to roam through<br>the the forests and the verges in europe<br>i think the last iraq officially died in<br>poland in about 1627.<br>so what they're finding is uh existing<br>domestic cattle species such as heck<br>cattle and you selectively breed them<br>for these primitive traits you make them<br>bigger and bigger horns and darker and<br>and what you end up with is<br>a pretty impressive<br>fairly docile looking beast<br>but is it in a rock have you really<br>de-extincted something probably not<br>you get much closer<br>if you think about cloning technology so<br>this is a bucardo<br>it's the last bucato so it has a name<br>celia<br>celia uh died in 2000. unfortunately in<br>1999 they took a sample of cells from<br>her ear and they cryo preserved those<br>and it allowed allowed people to attempt<br>to clone her so the procedure was to<br>take those cells or take a cell take the<br>nucleus out of that cell and put it into<br>a host cell that had been enucleated<br>from just a goat a surrogate goat you do<br>something to that cell you zap it or<br>whatever and you make it think it's an<br>embryo it starts to divide and you<br>implant it into a surrogate and then<br>that surrogate will give birth to a live<br>bukato and they actually achieved this<br>so we could say de-extinction has<br>already happened<br>unfortunately it only happened for seven<br>minutes there was a gross deformity<br>so that clone died very very rapidly<br>but a lot of the technical challenges<br>have been met in doing that<br>the third way<br>is where you you can go back further in<br>history<br>before people were cryo preserving<br>anything<br>so you have ancient dna an ancient dna<br>is an unstable molecule it breaks down<br>very quickly so if you go any any<br>distance back<br>it's very hard to read it<br>it's like people have likened it to<br>reading a book a very old book that's<br>falling apart so pages are missing<br>sometimes you you get a word or a<br>sentence or a fragment<br>thanks to a bit of desktop wizardry from<br>george church who's a harvard geneticist<br>it's possible to<br>fill in those gaps if you like so what<br>people have been doing and here's martha<br>again passenger pigeon<br>is read as much of the passenger pigeon<br>genome as you can so i think they've<br>sequenced about 40 birds there are 1500<br>specimens out there but there are gaps<br>you then compare that to a near relative<br>in this case the band tail pigeon<br>and then through this machine of george<br>churches you you fill in those gaps and<br>there are a few other steps of course to<br>to ending up with a hatchling that's a<br>passenger pigeon<br>passenger pigeon is an interesting one<br>to<br>put all this effort into they were a<br>hyper abundant species<br>five billion birds used to used to fly<br>around no one thought they could go<br>extinct there were there were stories of<br>flocks that were 430 kilometers long<br>that took three days to pass that might<br>have had three billion birds in them the<br>record someone fired into a flock one<br>shot and hit 15 birds<br>that<br>they were shooting them so much they<br>were using feathers they're using the<br>the meat but they were so many were<br>dying they're actually using it to fill<br>potholes and roads so no one really<br>believed that they could make this thing<br>extinct<br>and i'm not sure we want to de-extinct<br>it either i mean we we get upset when<br>one pigeon sits above our car<br>it did make me think what are the<br>de-extinction candidates and i went on<br>to the long now foundation and they have<br>this list<br>of various things there's a passenger<br>pigeon at the top and not surprisingly<br>moar is in there dodo<br>the iraq<br>bukado<br>down through woolly mammoths sabretooth<br>cats things like that you recognize<br>something in this list we've got<br>taxonomic bias so we're really thinking<br>about these big charismatic species<br>so how do you pick how what's a better<br>candidate than another<br>it's something like the thylacine the<br>tasmanian tiger is it really a good<br>de-extinction candidate it occurred to<br>me that if you don't want to do this in<br>order to create curiosities in a lab or<br>a zoo then you need to be releasing<br>these back out into the wild and that<br>brings it into my territory because what<br>you're doing is you're reintroducing it<br>and we have some nice guidelines to to<br>think about that<br>so with a colleague's axel in canada and<br>john<br>in the uk<br>we took those iucn guidelines we turned<br>them into a ten point checklist that<br>would be a pre-selection process for any<br>de-extinction candidate before you even<br>go to the expense or the trouble of of<br>trying to resurrect something run it<br>through this list do you understand why<br>it went extinct so it doesn't go extinct<br>again<br>what are the new threats that might be<br>out there<br>is there even habitat for it can you<br>sustain that habitat along into the<br>future what do people think about it are<br>people going to be on side with you with<br>this or not<br>is it going to affect livelihoods<br>and we we ran a number of species<br>through that so father scene actually<br>came out as a possibility<br>um trevor mallard talked about mower and<br>people said well the mower's not a goer<br>but he has at least one supporter so<br>this is mike dickerson who's the curator<br>in whanganui museum and he's he's<br>oversees the largest collection of bones<br>and parts<br>and<br>mike<br>thinks that moa could be a viable<br>de-extinction candidate he said i think<br>it could happen in about 100 years which<br>nicely takes it outside his lifetime so<br>a lot of arguments pros and cons around<br>this it's it's a controversial<br>topic so this is just a very brief<br>snapshot<br>so down the<br>left-hand side there<br>these kind of quest for redemption moral<br>imperatives writing past wrongs you<br>could ask how far back in history are we<br>still responsible for<br>and on the other side are more<br>compelling ones i think this idea of<br>deep ecological enrichment so not in the<br>lab or zoo but out there in the wild<br>enhance the resilience of ecosystems<br>restore those kinds of functions<br>there is a flip side though there are a<br>lot of cons to it<br>and and this poster actually captures at<br>least three of them quite nicely<br>so people consider this to be a<br>distraction from real issues it's not as<br>if we've we've solved all these other<br>problems it's not as if we don't have<br>species on the verge of extinction much<br>better to stop them going extinct than<br>to try and bring things back<br>there's only a limited funding out there<br>is this a distraction<br>also in terms of funding and resources<br>too much money going into these things<br>you could argue and<br>i think important one is this changing<br>the public perception that extinction<br>may not be forever<br>we're not in a crisis mode we bring<br>these things back later when things have<br>improved<br>i think also on this we can think about<br>ethical and moral issues so this little<br>little cartoon here this idea of close<br>enough this is actually a quote from<br>stuart brand people say have asked him<br>saying<br>you know how how close could you get<br>back to the original and he said well<br>close enough but we've seen with celia's<br>clone<br>only lived for seven minutes because it<br>couldn't breathe so that there are kind<br>of moral ethical animal rights issues<br>around<br>that at the end of the day though this<br>is a really cool idea<br>i think everyone can agree with that<br>there's a prominent australian ecologist<br>who's done a lot about prioritizing<br>species actions<br>and argues against the extinction<br>because of the waste of resources but he<br>he wrote to me in an email recently and<br>he said i would pay a thousand dollars<br>to see a resurrected moa or wooly<br>mammoth so i don't think we can we can<br>ignore that<br>i want to come back to this idea of our<br>sort of humans alienation from nature<br>this is daniel paulie<br>who's a well-known fisheries biologist<br>and he coined the term shifting<br>baselines he was talking about fisheries<br>but it's now been applied much more<br>widely<br>his argument was that each generation<br>whether a fishery managers or just us<br>gets used to a more impoverished<br>environment around us it resets our<br>expectations lower and lower and lower<br>so we have this kind of shifting<br>baseline of what the world around us<br>should look like<br>with apologies to daniel for the title<br>for the next slide but i call this<br>shifting waistlines<br>so this is this uh the royal royal guard<br>uh in saudi arabia overseeing uh release<br>of oryx<br>and as as keith explained yolanda and i<br>spent a number of years in saudi arabia<br>and<br>one of the things that was really<br>interesting to work there as a wildlife<br>biologist conservation biologist<br>was a society that's gone through such<br>profound<br>social economic change over such a short<br>time<br>and some of those changes obviously<br>being you know access to better weapons<br>and better nutrition but it's also<br>around the idea that um<br>people's engagement with the world<br>around them has changed so we think only<br>back in the 1950s most of that<br>population the majority of that<br>population were nomadic herdsmen<br>out there engaged their day-to-day<br>livelihood depended on them<br>understanding that natural world around<br>them<br>it's been increasing urbanization<br>so more and more people are living in<br>cities<br>with saudi colleagues we were interested<br>to see how this had changed people's<br>perception of<br>their native their natural heritage<br>really so<br>we posed questionnaire to a number of<br>urban based<br>high school children<br>and we see we gave them names of species<br>like baboon or gazelle or whatever we<br>asked them to pick a word to best<br>describe it whether it's just kind of<br>beautiful or amusing or tasty or<br>something like that<br>and<br>we're surprised one of the responses<br>more than around 50 of people considered<br>the desert fox to be dangerous<br>this terrible dangerous<br>animal that's out there it makes you<br>think what on earth<br>is this desert fox is it like a<br>wolverine it's kind of all snarling<br>teeth<br>while at great personal risk i managed<br>and here's the savage beast<br>seriously though<br>we we did engage with bedouin rangers<br>people in the desert they're not afraid<br>of desert foxes they understand<br>how how foxes fit into that environment<br>so this is kind of an alienation from<br>nature and a lack of understanding not<br>meaning to pick on saudi arabia i'm sure<br>we could do that same kind of exercise<br>with very urbanized populations anywhere<br>in the world including new zealand<br>yolanda and i wrote a chapter for a book<br>entitled reversing the extinction of<br>experience so this is a term to do with<br>engagement with with nature and how<br>we're missing out on these these<br>these opportunities to engage with the<br>natural world<br>and we argued that actual<br>conservation translocations<br>reintroductions are a way of restoring<br>a balance re-engaging people with their<br>natural heritage in a way to make them<br>understand what it is that they they<br>nearly lost<br>and we see a lot of this in new zealand<br>a lot of new zealand action to feel<br>quite<br>encouraged and proud about<br>so just just on our doorstep here is<br>orokunui sanctuary<br>where it provides a place where<br>natural vegetation is being restored<br>natural indigenous species are being<br>reintroduced and it's a place where<br>people can go they can see what the<br>world around them should look like and<br>reassess their<br>their expectations for what the world<br>should be like<br>i just want to wrap up now with some<br>some kind of thanks acknowledgements and<br>reflections if you like<br>so just thinking about<br>kind of my journey at otago<br>and<br>how it's been<br>almost surreal to have gone from kind of<br>student<br>to to academic this is lloyd davis who's<br>my phd supervisor<br>and it it's been fantastic to have been<br>his student then become his colleague<br>and it made me think about another kind<br>of learning situation that i've been in<br>through my life so ever since i was an<br>undergraduate i've been studying karate<br>martial arts<br>and i think there are a lot of kind of<br>parallels between that kind of<br>teacher-student relationship and what we<br>do within the martial arts so in the<br>same way that a phd supervisor instilled<br>those hard lessons onto their pupil<br>it's the same within karate<br>where teachers are instilling those hard<br>lessons<br>on their pupils<br>and then that student goes ahead<br>learns gets students of their own and<br>i want to um get back in yolanda's good<br>graces by thanking her<br>for<br>for being my team probably not the best<br>photo to show actually she's<br>she's standing there wondering why i'm<br>taking a photo of her rather than<br>pulling her out of the mud of the tasman<br>delta<br>but we've had some we've had some<br>adventures together we've always been a<br>strong team<br>and she's stuck by me<br>people change in marriage don't they<br>they change you go through phases i know<br>i've gone through some phases in america<br>but you know you get through that you<br>get over that and now my my kind of rock<br>and my foundation is my family<br>so with my boys connor and jasper<br>i want also to acknowledge the original<br>professor sudden<br>who's who's with me here today<br>and my mother who passed away a few<br>years ago<br>was really my father's<br>tales of student life in dunedin when he<br>was here as a medical student that made<br>me say right that's where i'm going to<br>go<br>and i've been associated with the<br>university for a number of years now so<br>this is the honours class from 1984<br>and there might be a few familiar faces<br>in there people have gone on to to good<br>things<br>actually my this is outside the front of<br>the zoology building and my first<br>uh encounter with zoology was actually<br>in 1981 when during the<br>orientation week<br>and i looked at this lovely facade there<br>and i thought i could probably climb<br>that<br>so i did i climbed that and very soon<br>the the header department's head<br>appeared out of the window i just<br>climbed past<br>and and ordered me down i thought this<br>was a bad start to university and i want<br>but it was a great pleasure that in 2001<br>we could come back and rejoin the<br>department of zoology which has to be<br>the most<br>certainly one of the most collegial<br>departments there so it is my daily<br>pleasure to interact with these<br>smart enthusiastic friendly colleagues<br>and i do want a single<br>one person out so this is ian jameson<br>looking very grim saving another species<br>that's about to become extinct<br>ian's been my friend<br>and colleague for decades now and when i<br>came to otago i actually approached and<br>i said<br>would you be my mentor for that and he<br>took that role on<br>so thank you for that ian and and you<br>arlene talked about students<br>this is our<br>our energy our enthusiasm our<br>productivity so this is a selection of<br>postgraduate students i've had the<br>fortune to<br>interact with work with<br>so if you're looking at this and and you<br>your photos not there and you think it<br>should be then you need to change your<br>and when i came here it was to take up<br>the directorship of the wildlife<br>management program<br>and it's<br>each year a new cohort of smart<br>enthusiastic<br>passionate people<br>i have the pleasure to interact with<br>it's going to be these people that are<br>going to go out and become the wildlife<br>managers the researchers the<br>conservation biologists of the future<br>and these are the ones are going to help<br>us kind of reconnect with our natural<br>heritage<br>and i can only say i think we're in very<br>good hands<br>ladies and gentlemen good evening tina<br>koto katoa my name is alison cree and<br>it's my great pleasure as the head of<br>department of zoology to thank phil on<br>your behalf for his wonderful talk<br>tonight<br>you will have learned much about the<br>history of the science of reintroduction<br>biology from tonight's talk<br>from the time when staggeringly it was<br>possible to fill holes in the road with<br>passenger pigeons something i'd never<br>known before<br>to recognition that extinction was a<br>reality and was going to be a continuing<br>phenomenon if action was not taken we've<br>learnt a lot tonight about the history<br>of translocation as one of the actions<br>that can be taken to reduce that risk of<br>extinction and i hope that you will have<br>appreciated in the history that phil's<br>given tonight what a leading role he is<br>playing in today's<br>use of translocations uh through the<br>iucn specialist groups of which he's a<br>member of quite a few<br>to<br>to take us forward into issues like<br>ecological replacement and the<br>de-extinction debate that's um going to<br>be ongoing no doubt um in future years<br>so it's been fascinating to learn about<br>that history from your your research and<br>not just research in terms of thinking<br>about the issues but putting them into<br>action and we applaud that workflow<br>i would also like to note um the<br>significant role that phil plays in the<br>university community and the he's<br>contributed to the university of otago<br>and to his role in our department<br>phil is highly regarded for his<br>leadership of the wildlife management<br>program you've heard about how he's been<br>the director of that program since he<br>arrived in our department in 2001<br>and he continues to refresh and keep<br>that internationally<br>attractive program alive with wonderful<br>students so thank you phil and your team<br>for the work in that area<br>you've heard also about phil's role as a<br>supervisor of postgraduate students and<br>he has many of them and they're really<br>productive<br>and we appreciate that greatly<br>finally i would just like to acknowledge<br>the the very calm and lucid and<br>collected way in which phil is a member<br>of our department helps us analyze<br>issues that's a really important skill<br>and we thank you very very much for that<br>phil<br>it's my great pleasure now to hand over<br>as a token of appreciation a gift from<br>the university and thank you once again<br>and invite everyone present to join us<br>to celebrate with phil in person in the<br>staff club at the end of<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
