podcast<br>good evening my name is Harlene Hayne<br>and I am the vice chancellor here at the<br>University of Otago and as always it is<br>my great pleasure to welcome you to this<br>inaugural professorial lecture um this<br>is the first IPL to kick off our 2015<br>season and I'm extremely pleased that we<br>are beginning our season by celebrating<br>the promotion of a professor in<br>humanities now many of you know that my<br>highest degree is actually in Sciences<br>but my very first degree was a Bachelor<br>of Arts I was actually blessed to spend<br>the first four years of my tertiary<br>education marinated in a liberal arts<br>curriculum that was steeped in<br>humanities and more than 30 years later<br>I remain a very fierce champion of the<br>value of this kind of education now like<br>many of you who are in the audience this<br>evening I see a very worrying trend in<br>New Zealand and other parts of the world<br>in which attempts are being made to<br>shift the focus of a university<br>education away from a broad-based<br>liberal arts background to more<br>utilitarian job training there seems to<br>be a considerable amount of unfounded<br>rhetoric about the financial value of<br>certain kinds of degrees and pursuits<br>over others with very little recognition<br>at the same time that students who study<br>the humanities find successful<br>satisfying and financially beneficial<br>employment both here in New Zealand and<br>around the world you might be interested<br>to know that one-third of all fortune<br>500 CEOs in the world right now<br>currently hold bas and so does the<br>finance minister and deputy prime<br>minister of New Zealand now in addition<br>all successful careers including<br>medicine law and business require<br>critical thinking teamwork and<br>sensitivity to cultural and political<br>perspectives and<br>as we are all well aware the humanities<br>provide essential grounding in these<br>areas many of our Otago graduates will<br>pursue their careers overseas and those<br>who master the language the literature<br>the art the religion and the politics of<br>their new home will fare far better than<br>those who do not for all these reasons<br>and many many many more here at Otago we<br>fiercely support the importance of<br>humanities in preparing young people not<br>only for careers but also for life in<br>the 21st century so tonight we have all<br>come together to celebrate the academic<br>achievements of a man who actually<br>embodies my aspirations for all students<br>here at the University of Otago<br>professor show gman is an outstanding<br>scholar who has made a significant<br>contribution to the study of comparative<br>political thought his book on William of<br>Ockham was a landmark achievement it has<br>been described as a masterpiece of its<br>genre and of and as deeply researched<br>lucidly written and succinctly presented<br>I am sure that the subject of that book<br>William of Ockham himself would have<br>applauded the author in much the same<br>way that we will this evening on behalf<br>of the University of Otago i would like<br>to warmly congratulate professor<br>Sugarman on his well-earned promotion to<br>professor and i will now call on<br>professor tony valentine to tell us a<br>little bit more about the journey that<br>tena koutou katoa it is with great<br>pleasure that I introduce my colleague<br>professor Takashi Sugarman Takashi is a<br>greatly valued member of the Department<br>of History and artistry he is an<br>influential and highly productive<br>historian and excellent teacher and<br>supervisor and an important leader in<br>our department and also in our division<br>where is associate dean of research he<br>is quite simply I think a fine historian<br>and a great colleague staff and students<br>from our department are delighted to be<br>here tonight to recognize and celebrate<br>the calibre of his work both as a<br>research scholar and as a teacher and<br>supervisor Takashi was born and raised<br>in the city of Yokohama Japan's great<br>port city and given the trajectory of<br>his subsequent career that location<br>seems very episode as from the 1850s<br>Yokohama was and has been a key site for<br>cross-cultural encounter an intellectual<br>exchange Takashi's father was a<br>physician and his mother a homemaker but<br>both of his parents place great value on<br>learning during his schooling Takashi<br>became very interested in the so-called<br>warring States period of Japanese<br>history during this turbulent age of<br>civil war from 1467 to 1603<br>fortifications proliferated in Japan and<br>many great castles were constructed and<br>it was these castles that captured the<br>imagination of young Takashi sugarman<br>his parents encouraged this interest<br>taking him to many castles especially in<br>western Japan Takashi was so passionate<br>about these castles he became able to<br>identify each by the distinctive style<br>of masonry and the layering the stones<br>to the skilled artisans used in the<br>construction while at high school has<br>entered intellectual interest broadened<br>beyond masonry and he began to take<br>shape as he as he read the work of<br>of Japan's leading thinkers and social<br>scientists in the post-war period and it<br>was at that stage he first began to<br>dream of being a humanities scholar or a<br>researcher in the social sciences he<br>entered keio university and 1986 a very<br>distinguished institution that has been<br>at the forefront of modern Japan's<br>educational system Takashi pursued a<br>degree in law and having Takashi's a<br>colleague I think we can still see this<br>in his forensics linking and very<br>careful exposition of his ideas and his<br>writing those legal studies were<br>interrupted or suspended for a year<br>while Takashi went to Japan to Canada to<br>the University of Toronto to study<br>English as a Second Language after<br>graduating from keio university in 1991<br>he went to britain to pursue graduate<br>work at university of sheffield under<br>the supervision of the eminent<br>medievalist professor david luscombe his<br>dissertation explored the thought of<br>William of Ockham the 14th century<br>English scholastic philosopher and<br>theologian and particularly focused on<br>the ways in which Occam's work<br>particularly his theory of heresy can be<br>understood as a contribution to<br>political thought that work has been the<br>foundation for much of decay she's<br>leader research and was developed into<br>his very important monograph that<br>professor Haines alluded to a command<br>political discourse in the late Middle<br>Middle Ages which was published in<br>Cambridge University Press is very<br>distinguished series studies and life<br>and thought from that foundation<br>Takashi's career has flourished and I<br>think he's developed into quite an<br>unusual historian and I think he's<br>unusual for a couple of reasons firstly<br>his work is deeply grounded and two<br>quite distinct fields I think a more<br>predictable trajectory for a scholar<br>from that kind of start would be to find<br>another late medieval thinker and one a<br>monograph on that but Takashi has taken<br>I think a wider vision in a more unusual<br>trajectory he has not confined himself<br>to the study of late medieval political<br>thought instead developing an<br>of Ark of work on Japanese intellectual<br>history this has led to a range of<br>articles and chapters on one Japanese<br>thoughts and to a recent book that<br>explored the freedom of speech and<br>university of autonomy in Japan during<br>the 1930s and of course those questions<br>remain live for many of us but Takashi<br>has not simply been content with<br>pursuing two distinct research tracks<br>medieval Europe and modern Japanese<br>intellectual history but rather he has<br>least together his knowledge of these<br>two fields and interesting ways firstly<br>he has written a sequence of works<br>exploring European intellectual<br>traditions and political thought for a<br>specifically Japanese market most<br>notably and in his 2013 book in Japanese<br>whose English title as the birth of<br>European political thought he explains<br>the emergence and significance of a<br>specifically European tradition of<br>political thinking at the turn of the<br>thirteenth and fourteenth centuries for<br>a Japanese audience that book is very<br>important and it won the very<br>prestigious suntory prize for Social<br>Sciences and the humanities in Japan and<br>that's an award of true national<br>significance of course as many of you<br>know Centauri is perhaps Japan's most<br>famous whiskey company and perhaps there<br>is an opening here in New Zealand given<br>that our New Zealand Post Book Awards<br>have elapsed for 2015 in addition to<br>analyzing and translating European<br>intellectual history for a Japanese<br>audience Takashi is also undertaken<br>explicitly comparative work here he has<br>been particularly interested in bringing<br>European Asian understandings of peace<br>into a comparative analytical frame and<br>more recently to think comparatively<br>about the nature of patriotism this kind<br>of important comparative work has been<br>supported by the Marsden fund of the<br>Royal Society of New Zealand and<br>Takashi's held both a fast start and a<br>full milestone grant here at o-tar go he<br>has championed the possibilities of<br>cross cultural analysis organizing<br>conferences on political<br>and cultures of peace and providing<br>leadership for the university's research<br>theme on comparative and cross-cultural<br>studies now I've suggested that this<br>impressive range of research expertise<br>and activity means that Takashi is<br>unusual he is also unusual I think<br>because of his age the history of<br>political thought really is a shrinking<br>field and many of its important<br>exponents who have taught us so much<br>have retired or a near retirement and<br>often they're not being replaced I think<br>here at Otago were very fortunate to<br>have Takashi introducing our students to<br>these crucially important thinkers texts<br>and arguments and Takashi is at the<br>forefront of this field and his work is<br>breathing new life into it he is opening<br>up important new analytical vantage<br>points in addition to pursuing the<br>possibilities of comparative analysis<br>has worked more recently has turned to<br>the possibilities that cognitive<br>linguistics offers scholars of political<br>thought and I think that is further<br>evidence of an inventive and innovative<br>mind at work I will stop now and let you<br>hear their innovative minds at work<br>well thank you very much Tony for the<br>very generous words of introduction and<br>i wanted to i would like to thank the<br>rest of the academic party<br>vice-chancellor professor Maloney and<br>professor Squire for being here this<br>evening and may I thank you all for<br>coming this evening it's very nice to<br>see so many of you here this evening and<br>before I proceed I would like to express<br>my thanks to my colleagues in the<br>Department of History and art history<br>for their unfailing support over the<br>years and also I would like to<br>acknowledge my friends and colleagues<br>who are overseas especially i would like<br>to single out six individuals namely<br>David Luscombe Constantine puzzle Kerry<br>nedderman mitsouko arima nay yang Guo<br>and Stephen Conway well just a moment<br>ago professor Ballantine kindly outlined<br>my academic career thus far and after<br>hearing that you might wonder why I have<br>been working on a disparate topics when<br>I was still a postgraduate student at<br>university of sheffield a number of<br>people used to ask me why on earth do<br>you work on a dead monk now the boot is<br>on the other foot since i have been<br>known as a medievalist for nearly two<br>decades now when some realize that I<br>also work on Japanese topics they ask<br>why do you should work on Japanese<br>history so I think some justification is<br>due in this lecture I proposed to offer<br>a personal reflection on how and why I<br>came to to to work to study intellectual<br>history especially the history of<br>political thought in both Western Europe<br>and Japan but obviously<br>I don't wish my talk to be too personal<br>or trivial and to be of interest to<br>anyone but myself rather through a<br>personal reflection I would like to<br>address an issue of contemporary<br>relevance in the Academy at least in the<br>Anglophone world that is the so-called<br>crisis of humanities of course I shall<br>not make any audacious claim that I have<br>a solution to the crisis my ambition is<br>far more modest in that through a<br>reflection of the trajectory of my<br>academic formation I hope to highlight<br>some points that I think are worth<br>considering in the relation to the<br>contemporary problems surrounding<br>humanities so I am only aiming to<br>provide food for thought from the<br>viewpoint of an intellectual historian<br>for those who care about the future of<br>research and teaching in humanities okay<br>so let me begin by sketching what I have<br>been doing in my research in<br>intellectual history my work has<br>revolved around two pillars one is a<br>history of a political thought in<br>medieval Europe and the other is the<br>history of political thought in modern<br>Japan I began my academic career with<br>the research in the political thought of<br>William of Ockham the 14th century<br>Franciscan theologian my study<br>highlighted Occam's theory of heresy and<br>his program of descent from heretical<br>Pope's ahkam was originally a theologian<br>and the logician at Oxford who did not<br>write anything about politics however<br>when he was asked by his superior to<br>examine paper balls which condemned the<br>Franciscan ideal of evangelical poverty<br>he realized that the contemporary Pope<br>had fallen into heresy withdrew<br>withdrawn from papal obedience Occam was<br>excommunicated exiled in munich he<br>produced a general theory of heresy and<br>visit a program of legitimate<br>from the heretical Pope and on that<br>basis he wrote an tiep April political<br>works to warn contemporary Christians of<br>the danger of papal heresy so I offered<br>a new interpretation of Ockham as a<br>political thinker who attempted to<br>rescue the autonomy and freedom of<br>individuals from unjust political power<br>such as that of a heretical Pope my more<br>recent work is a historical narrative of<br>medieval European political thought for<br>the Japanese audience the book entitled<br>the birth of European political thought<br>examines a historical no historical<br>process whereby political thought<br>emerged in medieval christened on<br>historians of political thought who work<br>on the modern period often argue that<br>there was no such thing as political<br>thought in the Middle Ages because in<br>the medieval Europe there was nothing<br>comparable to the modern state typically<br>medieval political thought took the form<br>of ecclesiology that is the theory of<br>church government supposing that<br>political thought is necessarily secular<br>one would struggle to find to find any<br>intellectually significant attempt to<br>theorize politics in the medieval world<br>meanwhile it was precisely in the Middle<br>Ages that to unified culture emerged in<br>the geographical region which we today<br>call Europe generations of a medieval<br>historians from our EP ran and<br>Christopher Dawson to Jacques Rogge off<br>and Robert Bartlett have firmly<br>established that the ancient Roman<br>Empire was not Europe Europe as a<br>cultural unit was born in the Middle<br>Ages in my book I try to answer the<br>question what kind of political thinking<br>emerged in the time when the unified<br>culture appeared in the geographical<br>area that is today called Europe I<br>responded to this question but<br>in two types of discursive traditions<br>one is the theatre emergence and a<br>development of ecclesiological<br>discourses on power that is it was<br>theological and a legal scholarship in<br>the medieval church that generated<br>sophisticated theories of power the<br>other tradition I highlighted I<br>highlighted what was the rise of the<br>theory about a civil community under the<br>influence not only of a resourceful and<br>Cicero but also of ancient Roman medical<br>scientist Galen the metaphor of the body<br>politic which was privileged in the<br>Middle Ages constituted an interface<br>between medical understanding of the<br>human body and the political<br>understanding of the civil community in<br>other words new theories of the<br>political community in the Middle Ages<br>were modeled on the new physiological<br>understanding of the human body now in<br>this argument methodologically I have<br>been developing a new approach to<br>intellectual history by deploying the<br>cognitive linguistic theory of metaphor<br>metaphor is not just a figurative<br>language it comes it constitutes our<br>control of one conceptual domain in<br>light of another the metaphor of the<br>body politic therefore represents the<br>understanding of the structure and<br>function of the political community in<br>light in light of those of human body<br>and what follows from this is that the<br>metaphor of the body politic helps us<br>hypothesize that political thinkers in<br>the past deployed medical knowledge in<br>order to conceptualize the political<br>community in the likeness of the human<br>body so I have been exploring a new<br>method whereby metaphor constitutes a<br>clue for reconstructing an intellectual<br>context in my case the medical context<br>I'd like to touch upon the second pillar<br>of my work briefly that is the study of<br>the history of Japanese political<br>thought much of my research has revolved<br>around political ideas in wartime Japan<br>in the 1930s and 40s I have especially<br>focused on the life and work of todavia<br>najara in an economist and a Christian<br>thinker a professor of colonial policy<br>at the Imperial University of Tokyo he<br>wrote extensively to examine<br>contemporary Japanese colonial policy in<br>Taiwan Manchuria and South Pacific and<br>also to attack the chauvinistic<br>nationalism and militarism of<br>contemporary government I have examined<br>his discussions of patriotism and<br>pacifism in contemporary intellectual<br>and verb and take the political context<br>also my recent book in Japanese offer<br>the micro historical analysis of the<br>event where in 1937 jana hara was forced<br>to resign from the University due to the<br>controversial that is pacifist<br>extramural speech the suppression of of<br>his speech did not come only from the<br>government media and even colleague at<br>the University contributed to the<br>expulsion of this liberal academic so<br>the suppression of freedom of speech is<br>a complex phenomenon and university<br>autonomy is indeed very difficult to<br>defend when the state and society are<br>going mad so my worker crosses your<br>graphical cultural and the temporal<br>boundaries and crossing boundaries is<br>quite natural to me because I don't<br>think that the boundaries are given they<br>are artificial and fictional<br>disciplinary boundaries in particular<br>result merely from utilitarian arranged<br>for the division of labor new questions<br>have given birth to new disciplines and<br>existing disciplines are constantly<br>changing in response to changing<br>questions so although it is customary to<br>identify ourselves as a historians<br>political scientists literary scholars<br>and so forth our own inquiries should<br>not be dictated primarily by the needs<br>of the discipline rather it should be<br>driven by questions because the<br>discipline is the result not the origin<br>of knowledge which is generated in<br>response to questions now as for me<br>inquiring into the history of European<br>and a Japanese political thought is<br>consciously dictated by two generic<br>questions one concerns the cultural<br>specificity of political thinking I am<br>exploring the cultural characteristics<br>of political theorizing with special<br>reference to Western Europe and Japan so<br>what is distinctively European about<br>European political thought and what is<br>characteristically Japanese about<br>Japanese political ideas one cannot<br>appreciate an intellectual traditions<br>distinctiveness unless one compares it<br>with another so an exploration into the<br>cultural specificity of European<br>political thinking requires comparison<br>and in my case this has been the<br>Japanese tradition the other question<br>that dictates my inquiries concerns the<br>dissenting tradition political theory is<br>in one respect a theoretical pursuit of<br>political ideals political theorists<br>conceptualize their normative theories<br>through critical engagement with a wide<br>range of political visions such as<br>liberalism republicanism<br>communitarianism feminism socialism and<br>so forth by contrast I am more<br>interested in<br>how political thinkers theorized unjust<br>tyrannical would diseased government and<br>how and why they legitimized dissent<br>from it ockham was at the center in 14th<br>century Europe while eni hara was the<br>center in 20th century japan the context<br>in which they the two men operated were<br>entirely different yet they both<br>wrestled with the same question of<br>legitimate dissent from unjust power so<br>how did I come to focus on these<br>questions well in retrospect I don't<br>think I did so in my postgraduate ears I<br>was immersed in the British tradition of<br>intellectual history in most of 1990s<br>and I owe a great deal to the academic<br>training at the University of Sheffield<br>in terms of research skills and<br>methodology however in terms of my<br>academic mindset and questions I cannot<br>help thinking that I am ultimately a son<br>of Japanese scholarship my fundamental<br>attitude to academic inquiry was shaped<br>profoundly by the undergraduate<br>education at keio university in tokyo i<br>am delighted to be able to talk with<br>sincere gratitude about two teachers at<br>keio university professors age sue me<br>and the late Professor cut Samira camera<br>professor zoom he was professor of the<br>history of political thought and one of<br>the few specialists of specialists in<br>the medieval European political thought<br>in Japan he advised me to continue<br>studying for postgraduate degrees and<br>choose medieval European political<br>thought as my specialized area professor<br>Nakamura was the professor of economic<br>history and his specialized area was the<br>history of early modern in<br>economic and social thought and I can<br>say gratefully that I am indebted to<br>them for my two key research questions<br>professor swimmy inspired me to<br>investigate into the cultural<br>specificity of political thinking and<br>the professor nakamura cultivated my<br>interest in the dissenting tradition now<br>what is common to both professors and is<br>deeply inspiring to me about their<br>teaching is that they lectured on their<br>specialized area with frequent<br>references to modern Japan their<br>historical discussions on European<br>intellectual history were often<br>connected with their critical<br>observations on modern Japanese politics<br>economy and society this is not to say<br>to be sure that they turned the<br>classroom into the place for political<br>campaigning they never commented on any<br>specific policy issues rather they often<br>highlighted long-term structural<br>problems with politics society and the<br>economy in modern Japan professor Sumi<br>often discussed the fragility of<br>Japanese democracy in light of modern<br>European political ideas while professor<br>Nakamura lectured on the origin of<br>modern capitalism and discern what<br>German sociologist Max Weber called<br>pariah capitalism and that is the<br>pursuit of wealth by antisocial and<br>unethical means in the practice of<br>contemporary Japanese capitalism notice<br>that they taught me in the late 1980s<br>this was a time when the Japanese<br>economy was at its zenith some<br>commentators even argued seriously that<br>the 21st century would belong to Japan<br>the two professors by contrast to<br>criticize the contemporary practice of<br>Japanese democracy and capitalism and<br>reflected anxiously on their future and<br>their lectures so their lectures<br>demonstrated that historical insight<br>could lead to foresight into political<br>economy of their own times but you might<br>wonder about the present tense tendency<br>of such undergraduate lectures on<br>intellectual history and indeed<br>historicism requires historians to<br>restrict their inquiries into the past<br>without reference to the present so the<br>lectures by the two professors I am<br>talking about clearly manifested at<br>tension between the historicist scrutiny<br>of past ideas and the philosophical<br>concerns with the present but their<br>presenters impulse did not originate in<br>anachronistic desire to see the past<br>through the prism of the present rather<br>the two professors concerns with the<br>present manifested their ambition to<br>shed new light on the present from the<br>perspective excavated from the past so<br>they represented past ideas which may be<br>alien to us moderns in order to gain<br>alternative perspectives on to the<br>present viewed from another perspective<br>their lectures did not merely<br>communicate knowledge their concerns<br>where the present suggests that their<br>Scoleri engagement did not constitute<br>merely the production and communication<br>of knowledge but was intended to serve<br>the purpose beyond the pursuit of new<br>historical knowledge now to clarify my<br>point let me give you an example one of<br>the key lessons they taught is that<br>while it is absolutely crucial to be<br>well-versed in existing scholarship in<br>the field one should not delve in<br>to research simply because a certain<br>topic presents itself as a gap in the<br>current research or because a certain<br>set of archival materials has not been<br>examined previously a gap in the<br>scholarship does not necessarily mean<br>that it is worth filling it the fact<br>that a set of archival materials has<br>remained an examined does not it so<br>factor mean that it is worth exploring<br>so the key question here is is it worth<br>knowing indeed some topics may not have<br>been explored because they are not<br>significant enough so the choice of<br>research topics and questions is<br>inseparable from some kind of a value<br>judgment we can certainly think of a<br>variety of standards by which to make<br>value judgments on the choice of<br>research topic but I just would like to<br>single out one issue some of you might<br>wonder how the two professors I'm<br>talking about sort of value neutrality<br>in their scholarly inquiries like many<br>Japanese social scientists of their<br>generation they were verb Aryan they<br>both embraced Max Weber's idea of verify<br>height the value free academic inquiry<br>indeed when they examined their object<br>of historical inquiry in their<br>monographs and the research papers they<br>did so dispassionately to observe value<br>neutrality however studying historical<br>objects dispassionately in the verb<br>Aryan value free fashion they<br>underscored does not necessarily mean<br>that the researchers should not make any<br>value judgment at all professor nakamura<br>conveyed this idea by an interesting<br>metaphor he said one must learn how to<br>read what is written before the front<br>cover of a monograph obviously nothing<br>is<br>physically before the front cover<br>because there's nothing what Professor<br>Nakamura meant was that one should be<br>able to read what value judgments<br>motivated the author to write the book<br>even if the author does not make that<br>motivation explicit in the book that is<br>a tacit assumption on which the study is<br>predicated what I would like to<br>underline here is that the two<br>professors I think did not teach their<br>academic disciplines merely as<br>intellectual exercise they try to show<br>that there are it is essential<br>dimensions to research in historical<br>scholarship asking certain questions in<br>historical inquiries should not derive<br>from mere interest or love of knowledge<br>historical research ought to be anchored<br>in the researchers fundamental outlook<br>on human life in our own times and that<br>outlook is a cynic quinone because<br>historical studies are unlike many in<br>the Natural Science many disciplines and<br>Natural Sciences inseparable from the<br>question of human conditions and values<br>in the case of the year two professors I<br>have been talking about their research<br>into European intellectual tradition was<br>clearly motivated by the disastrous<br>experience of modern Japan which<br>culminated in 1945 from the middle of<br>the 19th century Japan transformed<br>itself in a very short period of time<br>into a modern nation-state the reception<br>of Western institutions customs and<br>technologies was a top priority for<br>Japanese government and society but the<br>rapid westernization and modernization<br>also led to the rise of chauvinistic<br>nationalism and aggressive militarism<br>among other things the two professors<br>experienced the demise of militarists<br>Japan in their youth so they desire to<br>and what went wrong with the<br>modernization of Japan so their research<br>in European intellectual history was<br>thus closed closely rooted in their life<br>experience but they approached European<br>intellectual traditions differently<br>professor Sumi explored the cultural<br>specificity of European political<br>thinking because he desired understand<br>European culture in contrast with<br>something European which became an<br>alter-ego of modern Japan professor<br>nakamura returned to excavate the<br>dissenting tradition which would counter<br>patrimony ilysm which survived in modern<br>Japan despite their differing approaches<br>however they share the common concern<br>they're scary research was motivated by<br>the question of the demise of modern<br>Japan in 1945 which and depend the<br>cautious hope for new ideals in post-war<br>Japan so their research into the<br>European historical world was integral<br>to their active commitment active<br>engagement with the world in which they<br>lived and I find it fascinating that<br>academic research which is deeply<br>motivated by personal experience is not<br>reduced to the pursuit of the strictly<br>personal which frankly no one else cares<br>about but is instead tied to a moral and<br>civic commitment to illuminate the<br>problems of their day however precisely<br>because their academic work was<br>ultimately rooted in personal experience<br>and conviction what ultimately motivated<br>them to study was only implied in<br>lectures and or certainly not mentioned<br>explicitly in the box that was indeed<br>meditating on lessons that the two<br>teachers taught me i would like to<br>single out three points that may be<br>worth pondering for the present and<br>future for research and teaching in<br>humanities from a viewpoint of an<br>intellectual historian first i think<br>that the lifeline for Humanities<br>consists in our ability to show to the<br>public how and why our research really<br>matters today but obviously this cannot<br>be achieved by claiming merely that our<br>work is cool or interesting the ultimate<br>outlook to human life that underpins<br>research I think determines to a<br>considerable degree how and to what<br>extent our research sheds new light on<br>human conditions and values that are<br>meaningful in the present often however<br>our research is influenced and dictated<br>by Monday needs such as performance<br>evaluation of various kinds so the<br>research productivity can even become an<br>objective in itself unfortunately which<br>might make ourselves blind to the<br>ultimate purpose for which we engage in<br>research so reflecting on what our<br>research means not only to ourselves but<br>also to people around us and why we<br>study what we have been studying perhaps<br>helped us helps us not only to be<br>relevant but also to remain sane second<br>reflecting on the legacy of my two<br>teachers reminds me of the importance of<br>lectures in the undergraduate program<br>small classes with lots of hands-on<br>exercises might be more efficient in<br>communicating knowledge accurately<br>however most knowledge become out of<br>date quickly indeed I can hardly recall<br>anything about courses from<br>undergraduate days that only communicate<br>it knowledge so<br>undergraduate teaching I think there<br>should be more than infusing knowledge<br>Cardinal Newman famously claimed when<br>asked about the end of university<br>education I quote knowledge is capable<br>of being its own end the visitor shun<br>however may require qualification in our<br>time of hyper specialization where more<br>and more is known about less and less<br>both teachers and the students are<br>facing the tsunami of ever-increasing<br>specialized knowledge and in such<br>environment it is crucial for a teacher<br>to help students not only to gain<br>important knowledge but also to<br>understand the problems that the the<br>knowledge presents in the present and in<br>lectures a teacher should lay out<br>systematically not only knowledge that<br>the students should know but also the<br>meaning and significance of the<br>knowledge in the context where both the<br>teacher and students are situated and in<br>such lectures students will learn not<br>only facts and the theories but also<br>questions that are worth asking and<br>through such lectures teachers not only<br>communicate knowledge but also inspire<br>third it is important acknowledge our<br>around standpoint in the communication<br>of our research obviously there is no<br>such thing as a global standpoint we are<br>necessarily situated somewhere in the<br>globe and we are also in the present not<br>in the past or in the future my two<br>teachers lived and worked in Japan<br>mainly in the second half of the 20th<br>century as a Japanese citizens they<br>taught Japanese students predominantly<br>and wrote for the Japanese audience<br>hence they asked questions that are tied<br>to the historical destiny of modern<br>Japan but they are not the context in<br>which I live my academic life<br>at a certain point in the past I made a<br>decision to live my life in the<br>Anglophone world and that decision<br>eventually took me to this country as a<br>result a vast majority of my students of<br>party huh New Zealanders my work in<br>English is read by academics and<br>students in the relevant field in the<br>West and elsewhere while my work in Jack<br>knees is repped by the academic and<br>informed lay audience in Japan clearly<br>as an author and a teacher I am situated<br>in multiple contexts which my teachers<br>did not know therefore although I<br>inherited the fundamental questions from<br>my two teachers I should not answer<br>their questions in their ways the<br>questions must be digested fully to be<br>entirely mine and must be answered in my<br>own way if I take to heart to their<br>lesson that academic research in<br>historical inquiries should be<br>ultimately rooted in some sort of<br>existential motivations so my challenge<br>is a three-fold first I right works in<br>English for the audience in the West in<br>response to my first question that is<br>the cultural specificity of a political<br>thinking this way I seek to understand<br>the cultural distinctiveness of the<br>tradition of political thinking in the<br>West in Western Europe and Japan thereby<br>modestly contributing to the historical<br>self understanding of readers in the in<br>Western Europe and Japan although<br>ultimately it is rooted in my personal<br>desire for historical cultural and<br>political self understanding as an<br>individual who was born and bred in<br>modern Japan second i write works in<br>japanese for the audience in japan in<br>response to my second question that is<br>descent from unjust rule this way i<br>aspire to disseminate knowledge and<br>understanding of the dissenting<br>traditions<br>which in my view is relatively weak in<br>modern Japan but that is not the only<br>reason why I single out the dissenting<br>tradition dissent is a form of<br>resistance to injustice resistance to<br>injustice whether it be of earthly<br>powers a majority of society or even the<br>divinity is an undercurrent of European<br>culture which was crystallized long<br>before Europe emerged in Antigone of<br>Sophocles one of the three ancient Greek<br>tragedy ins hence my second question is<br>in fact a key leading me to the first<br>and third and finally as a teacher at<br>this institution I hope to continue<br>teaching European history especially<br>European medieval intellectual tradition<br>and political ideas in order to serve<br>the pedagogical purpose for students<br>which who in my view ought to learn<br>about European pursuit of ideals and<br>values such as the authority of<br>individual conscience which is a main<br>theme I aim to explore through inquiries<br>into my fundamental questions but one<br>might ask how useful it is to teach and<br>learn such things as a pursuit of the<br>authority of individual conscience in<br>European history especially in<br>connection with employability and<br>business-related skills of students my<br>response would be as follows I don't<br>think that history teaching is merely<br>about infusing knowledge and skills<br>history serves a variety of other<br>purposes the great english historian rh<br>Tony once wrote what is certain is that<br>issues which were thought to have been<br>buried by the discretion of centuries<br>have shown in our day that they were not<br>dead but sleeping to examine the forms<br>which they have assumed and the phases<br>through which they have power<br>even in the narrow field of a single<br>country and the limited time is not mere<br>antiquarianism it is to summon the<br>living not to invoke a corpse and to see<br>from a new angle the problem of our day<br>of our own age by widening the<br>experience brought to their<br>consideration so studying history is<br>thinking about issues which men and<br>women in the past wrestle with wrestle<br>with in context is different from our<br>own and the same issues emerge<br>repeatedly to the service of human<br>history in different forms and contexts<br>the question of the authority of<br>individual conscience is indeed one such<br>issue which was addressed and examined<br>again and again in European intellectual<br>history but remember the authority of<br>the individual conscience was discussed<br>especially when it came under threat in<br>the European past it was attacked by<br>religious authority and a political<br>power today it is subject to the threat<br>of economic power and one such symptom<br>is that the discourse privileged today<br>in universities and in societies around<br>the world subjugates the university's<br>research and teaching to economic values<br>and the judges academic disciplines in<br>light of economic benefit and efficiency<br>the modern world has a witness what Max<br>Weber once called the unceasing struggle<br>of deities as long as a variety of<br>values such as political economic<br>intellectual religious aesthetic and<br>many others remain mutually intention<br>human life in a society maintains<br>healthy if precarious balance in our<br>world of a global capitalism however<br>economic values such as profit and<br>efficiency penetrate and dominate<br>every aspect of human life the<br>encroachment of economic values and<br>language is now witnessed in academia as<br>well but obviously the university is not<br>primarily a business corporation that<br>pursues an insurance profit the purpose<br>of the university is primarily the<br>intellectual pursuit of knowledge and<br>for that and we University academics<br>value academic freedom academic work as<br>a pursuit of intellectual rationality<br>requires freedom of research and<br>teaching I shall not delve into the<br>conceptual intricacies of academic<br>freedom suffice to say it is largely<br>accepted that the freedom academic<br>freedom is a necessary condition for the<br>intellectual pursuit of knowledge which<br>serves the public good of a society and<br>ultimately of humankind but the public<br>good that academic freedom serves is<br>often construed today as being merely<br>economic as a result it is increasingly<br>prevalent to evaluate academic research<br>and teaching in terms of economic<br>sustainability and profit and that this<br>argument in turn puts a question mark on<br>the legitimacy of academic disciplines<br>which have little impact on national<br>economy it is highly problematic that<br>this view subjugates academic research<br>and teach teaching to economic values<br>because the legitimacy and the resin<br>debt of academic disciplines should be<br>judged primarily on academic grounds and<br>ought to be free from the sway of<br>economic or political power and that is<br>in one important respect what academic<br>freedom is about attack on humanities on<br>the basis of economic uselessness is<br>indeed a threat to academic freedom seen<br>in this slide the so-called crisis of<br>humanities is not a problem for<br>humanities alone it is symptomatic of a<br>crisis for the university as a<br>whole if academic freedom genuinely<br>remains the supreme value that we<br>collectively uphold American academics<br>are acutely conscious that academic<br>freedom has been under fire since the<br>book since the time of the Bush<br>administration legal philosopher Robert<br>post literary theorist Stanley fish<br>historian Joan w scott and the<br>philosopher Judith Butler among many<br>others have been engaging in vigorous<br>debate on academic freedom in recent<br>years New Zealand is rather unique in<br>that authoritative answers to the<br>questions regarding aspects of academic<br>freedom are provided legally in the<br>education act of 1989 however the fact<br>that the idea of academic freedom is<br>legally written down obviously does not<br>dispel all potential threats furthermore<br>the history of academic freedom suggests<br>that it is often very difficult to<br>defend it and the defense of academic<br>freedom is the owners with which<br>humanities scholars or bear precisely<br>because it is typically humanities<br>scholarship which has questions and<br>reshaped human conditions and values<br>including academic freedom humanities<br>researchers are facing a challenge the<br>first step towards overcoming the<br>problem of a day i think is to ensure<br>that we do not lose sight of the<br>ultimate purpose of our individual<br>academic inquiries that is to ask<br>ourselves what is written before the<br>front cover of our own monographs thank<br>many thanks to Kashi for a absolutely<br>fantastic lecture professor Sherman has<br>offered a compelling account of his own<br>intellectual formation and I think this<br>kind of reflection is tremendously<br>valuable but not only provides rich<br>insights into how monographs or<br>individual monographs and larger fields<br>of inquiry take shape but it also<br>reminds us of the forces that shape the<br>kind of work that we do in the Academy I<br>think in particular this lecture has<br>been a particularly rich appreciation of<br>the ways in which we are molded by our<br>teachers will Takashi in particular<br>Mulder by two teachers and by<br>supervisors and his case professors<br>nakamura and sue me and that really<br>reminds us I think of the very important<br>intellectual but also personal phrase<br>that attends our roles as academics and<br>teachers in universities so I think a<br>kind of public recitation of this type<br>of intellectual popper if you<br>like is tremendously useful for all of<br>us and we thank you for that Takashi of<br>course Takashi has also made a very<br>strong case for the significance of the<br>discipline of humanities even though he<br>reminds us that he's not a<br>disciplinarian first for the humanities<br>as a whole and particularly for the<br>importance of humanity's role in showing<br>up academic freedom in terms of his own<br>work he has also explored the deeper<br>epistemological and cultural questions<br>that have framed his research and<br>offered a compelling argument that<br>scares us away from either and marrow<br>historicism where the past is understood<br>purely on its own terms an approach that<br>can easily slide antique we're into<br>antiquarianism or on the other hand he<br>has warned against a mechanical present<br>ism where the past is only mobilized as<br>a tool to intervene and contemporary<br>political debate and cultural<br>contestation he points us to a rich and<br>fertile middle ground for historians and<br>for other scholars in the humanities<br>now I say other scholars very carefully<br>because Takashi has stressed to us that<br>he is driven pride by the primacy of his<br>research questions rather than by<br>disciplinary identity this reflects<br>something else that Takashi has<br>acknowledged tonight that he is a<br>boundary crosser has willingness to be<br>to move between analytical sites between<br>periods of intellectual production and<br>reception and between different idioms<br>of political thought means that his work<br>has been prominent in discussions about<br>the possibilities of a genuinely<br>comparative and a truly global history<br>of ideas and I think that's an<br>incredibly important project so tonight<br>we are really celebrating the fruits of<br>those intellectual journeys and we look<br>forward to seeing where those analytical<br>voyages will take a scholarship in the<br>future but we're also celebrating the<br>fact that he is ours to use his term<br>that he is situated here that is from<br>here that his scholarship may venture<br>far and wide but it has anchored in this<br>place in that we can count him as a<br>valued colleague teacher and supervisor<br>here at the University of Otago so thank<br>you<br>you</p></main><footer
