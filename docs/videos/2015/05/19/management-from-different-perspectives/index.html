welcome all of you<br>to this inaugural lecture by professor<br>Catherine pablovich inaugural lectures<br>are a very important part of the<br>university tradition they mark what is a<br>very important milestone in the career<br>of an academic relatively few of our<br>staff members appointed at professorial<br>level or promoted to professor and their<br>appointment to or promotion to that<br>position always signals a very<br>significant research contribution that's<br>important to the university because of<br>course it is our contribution to<br>research that marks universities from<br>other tertiary institutions and which is<br>the primary driver of our international<br>standing as a university so thank you<br>for coming this evening thank you for<br>joining us helping to celebrate<br>Catherine disappointment as a professor<br>it's now my pleasure<br>to introduce the Dean of the what kind<br>of management school professor Don Ross<br>to make a few introductory remarks for<br>thank you guys Chancellor very pleased<br>to have the opportunity to introduce<br>professor captain Kathryn tablet<br>students evening professor college is a<br>futurist and her teaching in research<br>explores new forms of organizing for<br>developing human flourishing in a<br>post-capitalist world these new forms of<br>organizing to give of the development of<br>technologies that include mindfulness<br>empathy and reflexivity to better<br>understand usually co-constructed<br>environment mrs. effective is evident in<br>your teaching and research on leadership<br>and entrepreneurship naturally as<br>someone who the university has seen fit<br>to promote to professor professor<br>coverlets had an extensive CV and we<br>could not begin to review all of it or<br>even much of it this evening I'll just<br>direct attention to a few of its harlot<br>she has offered over 80 academic papers<br>three of these appearing in<br>international refereed journal she

the co-editor of<br>the journal of management spirituality<br>and religion she's guest edited the<br>addition of the australasian<br>entrepreneurship<br>an organization she's currently on the<br>executive committee of the academy of<br>management this is a five year this is a<br>five year ten year leading one of 24<br>divisions of interest groups at the<br>academy it's a leading professional<br>association for scholars dedicated to<br>creating and disseminating knowledge<br>about management and organization and<br>it's one of the oldest and largest<br>scholarly management associations in the<br>world so a distinguished raisin<br>scholarly accomplishments and<br>distinguished publishing career and<br>distinguished research administrator<br>career with global dimensions she brings<br>great distinction to the school to the<br>wakatta School of Management and to the<br>University of Otago she has an<br>interesting and unique research<br>expertise corner of research expertise<br>and we very much look forward to hearing<br>her remarks the city congratulations<br>life empirical universe appeared around<br>you succeed in disrupting the balance<br>30 years in a single lifetime the earth<br>is the more radical change and by all<br>we know that the solutions aren't there<br>today<br>I've always been intrigued by the<br>statement we have the part of change but<br>what are we late waiting for this<br>implies our shift in our understanding<br>leader at the top of the hierarchy that<br>says come follow me and the followers<br>follow up we're talking about a gentle<br>leadership that resides in each and<br>every one of us knowing that our actions<br>do make a difference this implies our<br>shift in our understanding and awareness<br>of our responsibilities and that what we<br>do matters so this means asking those<br>big existential questions Who am I why<br>am I what is my purpose no purpose isn't<br>treasure the batch the vote in the<br>beamer that purpose is an hour legend<br>wash do we want to be known for what do<br>we get up for in the morning waters that<br>that inspires us that would even die for<br>this means no longer living in a bolus<br>as somehow we are here and we're<br>disconnected from out there it means<br>folding back out in a landscape and<br>looking at our own interior now this is<br>more than self-awareness this is<br>self-awareness and other awareness and<br>most of that space in between this is<br>what I'm going to talk about today now<br>one of my students rather write a poem<br>on this but I don't think he's here so<br>work is now cause struggle to turn the<br>corporate machine your money they burn<br>hope is now frail for those who live<br>behind the veil that are less on wings<br>does the new born leader saw in sale for<br>workers now brothers thrive and learn<br>and the corporate machine keeps the<br>earth clean through the new conscious<br>leaders vision once again our earth will<br>gleam so does old story when my own loss<br>on top of this hierarchy create a world<br>of separation between self and other<br>it's an extractive economy where we<br>don't have responsibility for those<br>board actions it's a world of winners<br>and losers however I do believe we're<br>writing a new story we're in the middle<br>of this great big shift we are<br>interdependent we are dynamic we have a<br>deep ecological way of actually seeing<br>the world it is participatory and it's<br>about a collective consciousness so let<br>me give you some examples of what's<br>happening crowdfunding as a starting<br>point the Grameen foundation which set<br>up to give loans to those at the bottom<br>of the pyramid those loans have been<br>returned by 99.1 seven percentage of<br>people so just because you could pour it<br>doesn't mean you're not going to be<br>honorable and repay the Kiva set up by<br>Jessica Jackley when she was in her<br>mid-20s all of us can jask of twenty<br>dollars that changes somebody's way of<br>living our own give a little here in New<br>Zealand 27 million dollars has been<br>given to that they're nearly four<br>million dollars in the past 30 days and<br>of course we've got our own social<br>innovation students<br>here aguacate oh that are prepared to do<br>good work something big is happening<br>think I get up there thank you so<br>something big is happening and even in<br>the word of entrepreneurship we're<br>starting to see a significant shift<br>these their packs that have got solar<br>panels on them so these kids can go home<br>and do homework when they don't have any<br>electricity I'm not sure what my<br>students using it as an excuse 450<br>babies die every hour because they're<br>born an impoverished conditions these<br>innovation around incubators $20,000 for<br>an incubator I mean that's just we can't<br>do that and so there's a lot of<br>innovation creating these small baby<br>backpacks and there's even some here in<br>New Zealand as well that are being<br>developed kibosh a different way of<br>using food they go around and they click<br>throughs that's no longer than used and<br>give it to those that actually need or<br>in Italy if you can't pay your water<br>bill you can actually pay it through<br>good deeds something big is happening<br>where they get between self and other<br>starts to close when we want to do these<br>good works just to help those that are<br>less well-off than ourselves they<br>understand we have the power to change<br>they are not waiting I am a management<br>educator my purpose is to help my<br>students understand what's what it's<br>like to live in a biocentric engagement<br>knowing what they do matters knowing<br>that they live an independent<br>interdependent complex environment that<br>they leave my care and those of the rest<br>of us being ethical and socially<br>conscious and knowing that there are<br>ripple effects for what they do now of<br>course I've been talking about these<br>things for quite a long time some people<br>call me weird and when I asked to<br>develop a course on spirituality in the<br>business school people said what that<br>the university did say yes and globally<br>we were seen as a world leader for<br>making that shift the interesting things<br>now is that this is mainstream according<br>to The Huffington Post you're probably<br>part of it I call it the consciousness<br>crowd so what I'm going to present to<br>you today is just a slice of my research<br>around their self other relationship I'm<br>calling the snow it at wisdom it comes<br>from the Greek word noesis which means<br>inner wisdom direct knowing it's about<br>our own subjective experience but within<br>an intellect adobo world william james<br>calls us a metaphysical quality because<br>it involves self and other and there is<br>aspect of transcendence as well i first<br>came across this idea of noetic when i<br>went to a spirit and business conference<br>in san francisco i have 15 years ago and<br>i heard of the know it institute of<br>noetic sciences this was set up by<br>captain Edgar Mitchell who was the sixth<br>man to walk on the moon and he commented<br>that when he was flying back to the<br>earth he would look out of the window<br>and it was a sense of such profoundness<br>and/or and he would just start to cry<br>and cry and cry he couldn't explain it<br>but he knew that the science and the<br>reality that he had been grown up with<br>was not the full story<br>that the molecules in this body were<br>actually constructed those in the past<br>the present and would go on in the<br>future and so he came back to earth and<br>he set up the institutional ethics<br>Sciences to look at that relationship<br>between science spirituality and<br>consciousness for some strange reason I<br>was always drawn to that and they also<br>have this much bigger network of people<br>like ten twenty thousand people so<br>there's always some interesting research<br>to look at I did get the opportunity to<br>mid meet Edgar and it's a it's like<br>touching Stardust before I go on to talk<br>about my research and my contributions<br>around the snow attic way of looking I<br>just want to try an activity with you I<br>want you to think of someone who brought<br>out the best in you what did they do and<br>how did they make you feel and if I gave<br>you some time you probably come up with<br>comments like this they excited and<br>empowered you there are fun to be around<br>the helped you understand the bigger<br>picture and gave you meaning in life how<br>did you feel you felt later you felt<br>relaxed and you're engaged in some forms<br>of laughter whatever they were if I ask<br>do the opposite think of someone who<br>brought out the worst in you you'd<br>probably come up with comments like this<br>they were bright co-managers they blamed<br>others here you get you get it you don't<br>need me to read this ok you know so when<br>you were with someone that's making you<br>feel good you're feeling bigger room<br>you're with someone that's not making<br>you feel good you're closing down and so<br>we have some physiological evidence<br>while living in the good head she is a<br>good thing to do a biology biology<br>calcium<br>so when we're feeling bigger our<br>parasympathetic nervous system is being<br>activated our blood pressure goes down a<br>heart rate goes down and our pulse rate<br>goes down it means that our immune<br>system means being activated to its full<br>ability on the other hand when you're<br>closing down your sympathetic system as<br>being activated that means your blood<br>pressure goes up your heart rate goes up<br>and your pulse rate goes up this is<br>significant effects for leadership so<br>now we understand I hope physiological<br>effects we also have psychological<br>effects of feeling good like this<br>Barbara Fredrickson came up with this<br>idea of borden and build through<br>positive emotions so when we looking at<br>this noetic wisdom we're looking at<br>these qualities such as gratitude<br>humility courage compassion and what<br>they do is broaden our scope of<br>awareness so actually we have a bigger<br>view of life if we're a leader we can<br>make better decisions because we've got<br>a broader scope of information that's<br>coming in we also have a better focus of<br>attention there are significant shifts<br>in our understanding of what leadership<br>can be about and secondly it builds our<br>own inner resources so we can become<br>more resilient and times when we need<br>that resilience to overcome some<br>difficulties so we've got physiological<br>evidence and now psychological evidence<br>why living in the good is better for us<br>and contributes to human flourishing one<br>of the things I do in the classroom is<br>they get my students to do artwork hope<br>this particular piece of artwork was a<br>hand blown glass dragon can you imagine<br>that and he talked about symbolizing<br>it's a dragon so it's fierce but it's<br>not real and he made the connection with<br>his own mind monsters they're equally<br>fierce but not real and so the question<br>we all have the power to change so what<br>are we waiting for it's about shifting<br>that is what I'll talk about now and so<br>I've come up with the framework around I<br>technologies which is I the technologies<br>of self that involve mindfulness<br>reflexivity and empathy and this<br>conceptualization that I did pull<br>together to get me a best paper award at<br>the Australia New Zealand academy of<br>management last year so we'll start with<br>mindfulness as I said it's a new hot<br>topic now Time magazine Scientific<br>American Newsweek they are all talking<br>about mindfulness what is mindfulness<br>but what we need to be hopefully aiming<br>for and I really like this photo because<br>it's a reminder to myself when my mind<br>is really full just to be quiet and<br>serene no matter what is going on around<br>us which is because as you know is<br>really difficult the folks at the Center<br>for mindfulness at the University of<br>Massachusetts Medical School which is<br>Harvard have come up with a mindfulness<br>training program they put people through<br>a 40 minute a day walking meditation<br>sitting meditation and half a yoga<br>program for eight weeks I'm only showing<br>you two of their quite significant<br>results okay so you can see the blue the<br>control group versus the red which is<br>those that have gone through the program<br>there is a significant difference here<br>after eight weeks this is the effect on<br>the left hippocampus which is we're<br>learning and memory is located okay so<br>meditate feel of 40 minutes a day guys<br>and you'll have a great increased brain<br>plasticity you're also regulate your<br>emotions so you become a better leader<br>and that you don't rush into things<br>before thinking them through the second<br>one I want to show you similar results<br>quite significant results the<br>temporoparietal Junction that's where<br>that broader perspective taking takes<br>place when you have greater empathy and<br>passion compassion that is significant<br>for this divided bridging of the self<br>other relationship so we now have<br>physiological evidence psychological<br>evidence and neuro imaging neural<br>science evidence to show us that living<br>in the good actually Dell's may<br>it can produce different types of<br>leaders people that act people that know<br>their responsibilities for a broader<br>world people that understand that the<br>impacts of these clothes might have on<br>the people making them and that there<br>are human rights issues being addressed<br>people that understand what's in our<br>food subway sandwiches people that<br>understand what's happening in our<br>environment one of the surprising<br>outcomes was it was the yoga that seemed<br>to make the most impact on us so no one<br>expected that and I think that was<br>because the yoga is such an action based<br>activity so it just helps hide quite in<br>the mind I can see some puzzled faces<br>here no that's not me so what am i doing<br>about it well I've developed a technique<br>for my students to learn develop through<br>right through a reflective journal<br>writing and as you can see they've been<br>a few publications their 2007 the this<br>technique has got more complex but has<br>also become a lot simpler this was<br>picked up by the Open University in<br>Australia with 3,000 students a year<br>through this and they put them through<br>this program so now I'm again I do get<br>emails from students that have gone<br>through this saying well I found it<br>really helpful so I ask most students<br>it's really simple to hid the heart the<br>hand the hid describe a situation that<br>you had what happened simple hard part<br>the heart how did you feel the boys hate<br>stuff<br>what emotions did you feel just identify<br>a couple go down what does it mean where<br>did you feel it in your body can't talk<br>well feel sick I mean there's a lot of<br>signs that we get from feeling at an<br>hour body and of course the hands what<br>are you going to do to change the<br>situation in the future the trick is<br>after they leave me that they know about<br>the heat heart in the hand but they can<br>identify it as the heart for head in the<br>head which means I'm knowing myself<br>better we're make sense of it many more<br>of the witness from leaders so there is<br>a shift in vast don't here 40 minutes a<br>day every day does my mind's the second<br>concept I want to talk about is this<br>notion of reflexivity now my colleague<br>and come rough who is she is the 50th<br>year distinguished professor appointment<br>at Bradford she's come up with this<br>framework which is our about it I and we<br>I've changed it into pretty pictures<br>here but it the stuff out there you know<br>the building you all know that I where<br>do I set this notion of being reflective<br>journaling but the thing we forget is<br>this idea of we that space between us<br>how do we reframe that because as we<br>become less judgmental that and have a<br>different relationship with things that<br>starts to change and so she and I have<br>both got a real strong and Trust in<br>using art in the classroom to create<br>these reflexive students who know about<br>this relationship between I and we I<br>included the speak<br> that took eleven hundred pieces of<br>a4 paper I talked her nearly 20 hours to<br>do that's pretty stunning and she talked<br>about needing to learn the virtue of<br>patience mindfulness and she<br>metaphorically spoke about her journey<br>of self actualization which of course<br>was like the peacock I digress what an<br>and i have done is identified three<br>practices that engaging in art dance<br>this is about performing art which means<br>we're no longer just have their<br>cognitive abilities in place like an<br>academic text but we have our full self<br>have our emotional self our spiritual<br>self we bring everything together and so<br>we identified three aspects that doing<br>art does first of all challenges are<br>triggers awareness so this student did<br>this board identifying her strengths and<br>weaknesses and surfaces what's often not<br>apparent and so she talked about singer<br>weaknesses and wanting to rub them out<br>we're doing this artwork and may enable<br>you to say I can embrace this this is<br>who I am and work with it in a different<br>way this notion of embodiment where do<br>you feel it in the body and along those<br>students talk about later you number<br>them talk about being involved in<br>teamwork and feeling that what they have<br>to say doesn't matter and how it touches<br>up the stomach and does things to them<br>so it's about being aware of of those<br>different aspects in the body secondly<br>at challenge ins assumptions and we've<br>got these masks that students draw in<br>terms of which which self is it that I'm<br>presenting and also allows us to use<br>multiple voices when they're doing art<br>they can be somebody else and feel what<br>like being in that space of the other<br>and finally transforming this notion of<br>curiosity and she's here popping out of<br>the the box saying that instead of being<br>judgmental which is what she silt<br>thought she was she's able to be curious<br>and that way around her so this is about<br>changing our mindset in the way we look<br>at the south of the world not being<br>judgmental driving down the road getting<br>really cross at someone that's really<br>slow instead of being cross twisting it<br>around to say I wonder what's happened<br>in their life that they are really<br>upsetting need to drive so slow it's<br>about having a different mindset the<br>third one I want to talk about is<br>empathy<br>this deer we sold as my granddaughter so<br>I can hear see happy faces here isn't<br>she beautiful we can immediately feel<br>that effective emotional empathy and<br>we're making sense of it so we<br>understand cognitive empathy as well<br>which is what the literature talks about<br>but what I'm positing is there is<br>actually a third part for empathy and<br>let me show you this the steer we soul<br>only after a couple of hours after this<br>photo was taken was in hospital having<br>serious surgery so many of you will feel<br>something and i'm not sure but i could<br>feel there was a shift in energy here I<br>know some of you would have thought it<br>as well so there are two things that<br>might help explain this the first one is<br>this idea of Marie neurons ten years ago<br>the neuro scientists discovered sorry<br>identified they didn't discover<br>identified these things with Marie<br>neurons which means the same neural<br>pathways in the brain are activated<br>weather we're having that experience how<br>could that these mirror neurons mediate<br>our capacity to share with others so<br>what we're suggesting if there is this<br>hearing going on how can that happen so<br>I'm suggesting that at the quantum level<br>we are connected through that deep<br>interconnection that deep empathy and<br>I'm feeling another's pain and joy it<br>becomes our own forming an<br>interconnecting confluence that have<br>significant shift in this idea of a<br>collective consciousness and how there<br>are so many people wanting to help<br>other in some way we understand that<br>it's the atomic level the world is made<br>up of particles but at the subatomic<br>level we know they are waves as well so<br>information has been passed through<br>waves have any of you suddenly thought<br>of someone that you haven't seen or<br>heard from a long time and suddenly you<br>see them or they phone you up how can we<br>explain that I think most of us have had<br>that experience it could be that<br>information is being changed flow<br>through at that subatomic level okay<br>this might be really weird for some<br>people but I do believe that this idea<br>of quantum empathy can help us explain<br>this shift between more endless changing<br>this relationship between self and other<br>interesting love Don talked about my<br>role at the academy of management this<br>has ten thousand international delegates<br>at their conference every year and I did<br>get a best paper award for this strange<br>idea and out of that several things<br>happened one was I did get invited from<br>that best paper to be on the leadership<br>committee for this particular division<br>at the academy second we were invited by<br>routledge to write a book on this<br>particular topic those of you that are a<br>academic know that Rutledge is one of<br>our top academic publishers and thirdly<br>we got it into an a journal the Journal<br>of business ethics this paper has been<br>quite well sited without being despite<br>being weird and I'm a wide variety of<br>journals clearly the management ethics<br>journals but also designed thinking men<br>academy of management perspectives which<br>was one of our top journals even a<br>neuroscience journal and a medical<br>journal how can there's been all good<br>staff<br>so we're just trying to challenge the<br>way that we think about this I other<br>relationship and we can start to see<br>that collective consciousness being<br>played out and so many environments /<br>tag are right hot right with you that<br>happened after the event in Sydney<br>people want to show that they care and<br>there have been so many other examples<br>around the shift in the way that we see<br>the other many of you might be saying<br>yeah that's really interesting hmm<br>what's this got to do with business li<br>locust on something that was quite<br>extreme these people have all moved to<br>emerging economies solely solely to help<br>alleviate poverty these are not social<br>enterprises these are social business<br>they have to make a profit to stay in<br>business to fulfill their purpose here<br>is one yoga wear clothing which started<br>off as yoga clothing but then moved into<br>leisure clothing she spends six months a<br>year and barley working this with those<br>people to try and make organic cotton<br>mainstream she says to me the<br>inspiration is not about making money I<br>want to be part of normalizing a more<br>ethical and conscious form of business<br>here's one of my favorites freeze it<br>again it's a auckland couple he said he<br>used to roam the streets of all<br>condenses I need to move somewhere else<br>to really make a difference so his wife<br>himself and their four young children<br>moved to Calcutta they rented a house<br>and in the middle of the night creating<br>freedom so he set up a textile business<br>he said mostly you would employ people<br>in a business like mine based on how<br>good their sewing skills are but he<br>employs his women based<br>on their need for freedom and changing<br>cycle cost of our forger poverty he says<br>something changes about you and he talks<br>about humility is the greatest thing<br>when your selfishness rules you can't<br>see it because you tend to go after<br>stuff that doesn't count rain Africa the<br>most beautiful bath and body products<br>which unfortunately we can't get a new<br>zealand made in South Africa all<br>handmade the same story she wants to<br>change the system the people that are<br>through virtually unemployable in her<br>hand and her land it's not about profit<br>it's about making a positive difference<br>to other people's lives educating them<br>medical care giving them hope my final<br>top strategy guides like Jay Barney and<br>Otto Sharma not expecting them to say<br>yes and they said yes they talked about<br>their own spirituality and how that<br>shaped their business their academic<br>careers they also which is kind of<br>pretty cool j said but he said the<br>reason my many of my leaders are<br>successful is because we do make on them<br>the sustainable network a war facebook I<br>see Slade you won't be able to read do<br>to show you I'm not making it up but a<br>few a month or two ago I got this email<br>out of the blue from a student who was<br>mine in 2010 and she talked about being<br>a silica my class I don't know that<br>usually I can pick it up they didn't<br>know that with her she was very Korea<br>faith focused and wanted to work for you<br>know a really high-powered corporate<br>which he did in she was nison violet and<br>didst appear and say I feel the way I<br>feel right my focus has shifted<br>from profit maximization into conscious<br>and purposeful engagement and my dreams<br>being a highly successful businesswoman<br>now means engaging and connected I hope<br>you agree we are in the middle of a big<br>shift a shift in consciousness a noetic<br>way that helps us bridge that<br>relationship between self and other my<br>research contributions are developing an<br>ontological shift and mindset in the way<br>we see of the world this is not just<br>about self-awareness this is much bigger<br>than that it's a reframing of who we are<br>my name is Jonas and it's my PhD giving<br>us some insights open to harrahs search<br>into here teaching approaches and how we<br>also might view the world differently<br>mixing a psychological and physiological<br>aspects and leaves and leadership in the<br>difference of that can make particularly<br>around mindfulness reflexivity in<br>empathy and the way that we can organize<br>and manage ourselves that lead to mate<br>so it's my real pleasure now to do have<br>really we don't have questions that we<br>thank you sorry that fellow there's no<br>plot<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
