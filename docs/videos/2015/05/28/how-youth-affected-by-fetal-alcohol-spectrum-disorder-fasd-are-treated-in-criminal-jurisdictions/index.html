Such outcomes are doomed to be repeated when there is systematic failure to identify and appropriately accommodate their disability across the lifespan.<br> <br>The International Consensus Statement on Legal Issues of FASD from Canada identified that the actions of people affected by FASD “clash with assumptions about human behaviour at almost every stage of the justice system”. The recent Privy Council decision to quash the 20 year murder conviction of Mr Teina Pora provides a timely reminder of the implications of getting this wrong.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity:

for our dean professor<br>andrew stockley who sends his warm<br>regards to to you and to catherine he<br>can't be here because he's overseas at<br>the moment so i'm standing in for him<br>but it's um it's our great pleasure to<br>welcome you here tonight uh it's good to<br>see a nice crowd at six o'clock on a<br>tuesday evening<br>and i'm sure we're going to be in for a<br>real treat as catherine<br>speaks to us<br>i'll just give you a very brief bio of<br>catherine because it's quite interesting<br>and it's important that you know who she<br>is and where she's from<br>she is a a magistrate but we call her<br>judge she's a magistrate from<br>perth where she's based in the<br>children's court<br>she's<br>worked previously as a magistrate in the<br>magistrates court of western australia<br>and for two years<br>between 2008 and 2010<br>she was the resident magistrate<br>uh in the east kimberley now she may<br>well want to explain<br>what or where the east kimberley is but<br>it's somewhere over there<br>and in that capacity she had has dealt<br>with<br>adults and children<br>in various regional towns<br>and with aboriginal communities<br>as well<br>her particular interest and the reason<br>that she's come here<br>is to is to pursue her interest<br>in and to to lecture on fetal alcohol<br>spectrum disorder<br>as it affects young people who appear<br>in court<br>and the<br>impacts particularly the adverse impacts<br>that that has on individuals families<br>and communities<br>especially while it's undiagnosed<br>and without appropriate support and<br>judge crawford believes as a matter of<br>justice<br>and to facilitate community protection<br>that courts need to be enabled<br>to factor<br>fetal alcohol syndrome disorder as a<br>disability<br>and impairment and take it into account<br>when dealing with youth<br>and in sentencing in order to properly<br>reflect issues of culpability and<br>capacity<br>in individuals<br>and i think it's a very important topic<br>which<br>has<br>in relatively recent years begin to come<br>to the surface in new zealand and i<br>think is a growing awareness so we<br>really are indebted to<br>judge crawford to be here to talk to us<br>tonight<br>she's here on a<br>churchill fellowship<br>and this is the tail end of a<br>three-month<br>odyssey where she's traveled to a number<br>of other countries in the world and<br>we're very lucky that she's been able to<br>come and to be with us tonight so could<br>you please join in welcoming judge<br>crawford<br>thank you for coming out this evening<br>now<br>firstly could i thank professor<br>brook banks for<br>the<br>kind welcome<br>this evening<br>and<br>also for making this opportunity<br>available<br>and that was<br>i<br>as he said i'm at the tail end of<br>travelling around talking to people<br>about<br>how<br>young people affected by fetal alcohol<br>spectrum disorder<br>and involved in the criminal justice<br>system are being dealt with in various<br>places<br>i feel inadequate to the task of<br>talking to you<br>about that issue today in the sense that<br>i've<br>made a lot of observations i've acquired<br>an awful lot of material from an awful<br>lot of different people<br>and of course i'm yet to properly<br>digest it process it and write a report<br>which i'll be doing very shortly<br>but<br>this is a wonderful opportunity to be<br>able to share with you some of my<br>observations about<br>programs that appear to be working in<br>some places<br>and<br>put that<br>in a human rights<br>context<br>now before i get to that can i just<br>firstly acknowledge and thank<br>christine rogan<br>from alcohol health watch<br>for<br>organizing<br>this<br>event<br>this evening<br>my perception in watching<br>from afar things unfold<br>to<br>some extent in new zealand<br>is that she and that organisation have<br>been quite a leader in<br>trying to<br>educate and promote the importance of<br>the issue<br>in<br>this community<br>i also wanted to acknowledge and thank<br>assisting me when i first became<br>interested in this issue<br>to better understand the implications of<br>it<br>for young people and some of the options<br>available<br>when it comes to assessment and<br>diagnosis<br>now<br>my visit to new zealand is part of<br>the project and<br>in other words that means i perceive<br>that new zealand is well ahead of<br>australia in the practical response<br>uh to the challenge that fasd presents<br>uh to our communities<br>and i've come here to<br>learn what's happening here and see what<br>might be applicable in<br>australia<br>now<br>after making a few more preliminary<br>remarks<br>i proposed to<br>lay the groundwork<br>by briefly recapping<br>what<br>fasd is and the challenge that it poses<br>for the criminal justice system and then<br>i propose to<br>identify just a few of the obligations<br>on states<br>which<br>are created by several international<br>human rights instruments<br>as a frame of reference for the<br>conversation about<br>how communities should respond to fetal<br>alcohol spectrum disorder as it affects<br>a young person in the criminal justice<br>system<br>a disability that so often is invisible<br>as i've traveled from vancouver to<br>ottawa<br>to whitehorse and the yukon and various<br>points in between<br>and<br>in the u.s i had an opportunity to visit<br>washington d.c new orleans and<br>minneapolis st paul i can tell you that<br>there is much variation<br>there are some high points where<br>communities have raced ahead with<br>diagnosis and intervention<br>but in others<br>not much is happening<br>or at least not much in the justice<br>space<br>now<br>my project has not been concerned with<br>prevention but lest you think i don't<br>think that's important<br>i i actually think it's a extremely<br>important objective<br>but from where i sit<br>i'm not concerned so much with<br>prevention<br>as<br>with the<br>youth who've suffered brain damage<br>in the form of fetal alcohol spectrum<br>disorder and are involved in the<br>criminal justice system they are at risk<br>of injustice if the court is not aware<br>of the disability and fails to take it<br>into account when sentencing<br>there is a high risk of further<br>offending unless suitable and<br>appropriate intervention is put in place<br>for that young person<br>that is imperative to improve the life<br>outcomes of the individual youth their<br>family and<br>to improve community safety<br>the failure to diagnose fetal alcohol<br>spectrum disorder in a young person<br>affected by it who's involved in the<br>criminal justice system causes injustice<br>to the individual<br>and exposes the family and community to<br>a repetition<br>of the unlawful behavior and indeed<br>likely escalation of the offending as<br>the young person grows physically<br>suffers secondary disabilities and those<br>dealing with the young person are unable<br>to handle the<br>behaviors now as a matter of justice and<br>to facilitate community protection<br>courts need to be enabled to take fetal<br>alcohol spectrum disorder as a<br>disability impairment into account when<br>dealing with the youth and sentences<br>need to reflect<br>the culpability of the individual and<br>the capacity of the particular<br>individual in the context of the need<br>for community safety<br>now uh<br>in<br>late 2013<br>there was a conference<br>in edmonton alberta canada<br>which<br>adopted an unusual process it was a<br>juried process where various experts in<br>aspects of fetal alcohol spectrum<br>disorder draw drawn from a wide range of<br>disciplines in effect gave evidence to a<br>jury chaired by<br>a retired supreme court judge<br>judge bini<br>and<br>after three days of hearing this<br>evidence from a large number of experts<br>they then proceeded to draft a consensus<br>statement on legal issues relating to<br>fetal alcohol spectrum disorder<br>i would highly recommend that document<br>to anyone who is serious about<br>coming to grips with fetal alcohol<br>spectrum disorder and the challenges it<br>presents<br>in the legal system<br>just to briefly set the scene of<br>for what i want to talk about in a few<br>minutes i want to just recap on a couple<br>of points that are set out in that<br>consensus statement firstly it provides<br>a useful summary of the nature of the<br>disorder<br>it states that fasd refers to a range of<br>physical neurodevelopmental and<br>behavioral impairments<br>resulting from damage to the brain of<br>the fetus caused by maternal alcohol use<br>during pregnancy<br>the impairments<br>may include growth retardation<br>malformations of the face neurological<br>disorders and deficiencies such as<br>problems with memory learning attention<br>and social communication<br>the facial abnormalities<br>are not always present and therefore<br>fasd is frequently invisible and<br>undiagnosed<br>the brain trauma that alcohol causes<br>in the fetus is irreparable lifelong and<br>devastating for the individual family<br>and other caregivers<br>now the consensus statement goes on to<br>neatly describe the challenge that fasd<br>poses to the legal system<br>in terms of the fundamental assumptions<br>which the legal system makes about the<br>behaviour of individuals and it states<br>uh the neurodevelopmental deficits<br>associated with fasd present a<br>fundamental challenge to the canadian<br>criminal justice system which is<br>premised on assumptions that people act<br>in a voluntary manner that is determined<br>by free will that they can make informed<br>and voluntary choices with respect to<br>both the exercise of their rights and<br>the decision to commit crimes<br>it's presumed that a person intends the<br>natural consequences of his or her<br>actions and that for example an<br>individual would never make a statement<br>against his or her interest<br>unless it was either true or coerced<br>the jury went on to say that the<br>evidence that they had heard was<br>compelling<br>that those with fasd are likely to have<br>a diminished capacity to foresee<br>consequences<br>make reasoned choices or learn from<br>their mistakes<br>therefore their actions are likely to<br>clash with assumptions about human<br>behaviour at almost every stage of the<br>and individuals with fasd are more<br>likely to be involved in the legal<br>system than individuals without fasd<br>uh it went on to note that children with<br>fasd are over represented in the foster<br>care and group care systems<br>and their special needs and<br>developmental issues have been<br>identified by the courts in all aspects<br>of the law from criminal prosecutions to<br>guardianship family violence and child<br>protection applications<br>now it's important for us to<br>remember that fasd represents a broad<br>spectrum of symptoms of greatly varied<br>severity giving rise to a range of<br>disorders disabilities and consequently<br>varying degrees of diminished<br>and the consensus statement went on to<br>note that the elements of neurological<br>damage associated with fasd are well<br>established however their expression and<br>intensity<br>now it went on to note that<br>fasd affected individuals are vulnerable<br>to secondary disabilities<br>it's stated as a result of permanent<br>brain damage and other factors a person<br>with fasd is vulnerable to secondary<br>disabilities and adverse impacts these<br>include leaving school family and<br>placement breakdown homelessness alcohol<br>and drug abuse and related infectious<br>diseases<br>many youth with fasd have been taken<br>into care and are being raised by foster<br>families or group homes often with<br>several failed placements<br>and possibly inadequately trained<br>caregivers<br>and it noted that these populations may<br>overlap with a disproportionate<br>apprehension of aboriginal children in<br>the child welfare system<br>unemployment mental illness and<br>involvement with the criminal justice<br>system are common<br>and it went on to note that the evidence<br>was that a majority about 60 of<br>individuals with fasd<br>come into conflict with the law<br>so<br>having set the scene about the nature to<br>some extent in a you know summary way<br>the nature of the disability and the<br>challenge that it poses<br>to the criminal justice system<br>i note in the west australian context<br>that youth justice<br>legislation<br>has various<br>relevant<br>youth justice legislation here and that<br>is that<br>um rehabilitation of the young person<br>is a prime objective if the young person<br>enters the criminal justice system<br>secondly that there be punishment of the<br>young person a third objective is to<br>facilitate the growth and develop<br>development of a responsible member of<br>now as important as domestic legal and<br>policy frameworks are in framing this<br>discussion i think we can<br>gain greater insight into<br>towards<br>young people with fetal alcohol spectrum<br>disorder if we look to standards which<br>are set in international human rights<br>instruments<br>now i don't aim to be exhaustive here<br>but i will identify a couple of<br>instruments<br>and some of the obligations<br>established<br>in their provisions<br>so<br>if we start with the rights of the child<br>convention for example<br>arguably there's a number of provisions<br>which are relevant<br>however i'll just point to the following<br>which may be<br>the more pertinent<br>um is to the effect that children who<br>have any kind of disability<br>should receive special care and support<br>so they can live a full and independent<br>life<br>is to the effect that education should<br>develop each child's personality<br>and talents<br>to the<br>full article 36 children should be<br>protected from any activities that could<br>harm their development<br>now just to<br>digress on that particular obligation<br>for a moment<br>arguably<br>a youth affected by fasd<br>who the literature suggests is more<br>vulnerable to exploitation and<br>victimization<br>is likely to suffer<br>mental health issues<br>as well as various other challenges so<br>all of that<br>emerges<br>from the research and the literature to<br>place such a young person side by side<br>in a youth detention facility or<br>once they've turned 18 in an adult<br>prison environment<br>when they are likely to have a<br>developmental age much younger<br>is entirely inconsistent with the<br>obligation to protect them from harm<br>so<br>if i keep going just to identify a<br>couple of more<br>obligations in the rights of the child<br>is to the effect that children who break<br>the law should not be treated cruelly<br>now arguably to place a young person<br>affected by fasd that is a brain<br>impairment and a disability in a<br>detention environment or fail to treat<br>them in a manner which is appropriate to<br>their developmental age is cruel<br>article 40<br>children who are accused of breaking the<br>and<br>it goes on to talk about<br>prison sentences for children<br>should only be used for the most<br>serious offences<br>now i'll turn to the convention on the<br>it starts out and i'm here being<br>selective because of course you don't<br>have the instrument in front of you and<br>it's hard to digest this<br>orally<br>but it starts out<br>as these conventions often do with<br>a number of paragraphs that recognise<br>certain<br>facts or<br>their statements of principle so in this<br>convention one of those is recognising<br>also that discrimination against any<br>person on the basis of disability is a<br>violation of the inherent dignity and<br>worth of the human person<br>further on recognising further the<br>diversity of persons with disabilities<br>that's particularly pertinent to this<br>type of disability<br>given there's such a wide range<br>of<br>impairment<br>it goes on this convention on the rights<br>of people with disabilities article 3<br>sets out a number of general principles<br>i'm just going to identify a few<br>for the purposes of this discussion<br>so the principles of the convention<br>shall be respect for the inherent<br>dignity individual autonomy including<br>the freedom to make one's own choices<br>and independence of persons<br>uh<br>another principle is non-discrimination<br>another principle is full and effective<br>participation and inclusion in society<br>another is respect for difference and<br>the acceptance of persons with<br>disabilities as part of human diversity<br>and humanity<br>it goes on to<br>another principle is equality of<br>opportunity accessibility<br>respect for the evolving capacities of<br>children with disabilities and respect<br>for the right of children with<br>disabilities to preserve their<br>identities<br>and<br>it goes on in article 3<br>to impose upon<br>states that ratify the convention the<br>obligation to promote the training of<br>professionals and staff working with<br>persons with disabilities in the rights<br>recognized in this convention so as<br>better to provide the assistance and<br>services which are guaranteed by those<br>rights<br>it goes on in a further paragraph of<br>article 3<br>states having an obligation to closely<br>consult with and actively involve<br>persons with disabilities including<br>children with disabilities through their<br>representative organizations<br>now arguably<br>that<br>in the fasd area<br>might be used to persuade government<br>that in the development of any strategy<br>or plan<br>for dealing with the issue of fasd<br>that the voice of those affected<br>and their carers and circle of support<br>needs to be a very important part of the<br>development of any such<br>strategy<br>now this convention on the rights of<br>people with disabilities goes on at<br>article 5<br>to refer to equality and<br>non-discrimination<br>recognising that all persons are equal<br>before and under the law and entitled<br>without any discrimination to the equal<br>protection and equal benefit of the law<br>it goes on to create an obligation on<br>states that ratify the convention to<br>prohibit all discrimination on the basis<br>of disability and guarantee to persons<br>with disabilities equal and effective<br>legal protection against discrimination<br>on all grounds<br>and<br>states are required in order to promote<br>that equality and eliminate<br>discrimination to take all prop<br>appropriate steps to ensure that<br>reasonable accommodation for the<br>disability<br>is provided<br>article 7<br>which is entitled children with<br>disabilities<br>imposes upon state<br>parties the obligation to take all<br>necessary measures to ensure the full<br>enjoyment by children with disabilities<br>of all human rights and fundamental<br>freedoms on an equal basis with other<br>children now think about that in the<br>where<br>in my experience<br>children with<br>various uh behavioral<br>neurodevelopmental issues um often<br>um are failing from quite a young age in<br>the education system<br>and often the outcome is exclusion<br>rather than accommodation<br>rather than<br>working with the child and the carer<br>and various support services to<br>modify<br>the education program<br>to accommodate for<br>the particular<br>challenges and impairments that that<br>young person suffers<br>and article seven uh which is concerned<br>with children of just with disabilities<br>goes on to<br>uh<br>requires that states<br>ensure<br>that in all actions concerning children<br>with disabilities the best interests of<br>the child shall be the primary<br>consideration<br>and also part of that particular article<br>is the obligation on state parties to<br>ensure that children with disabilities<br>have the right to<br>express their views freely<br>for their views to be given<br>due weight in accordance with their age<br>and maturity<br>on an equal basis with other children<br>and to be provided with disability and<br>age appropriate assistance to realise<br>that right<br>of course one of the issues here is the<br>chronological age might be<br>15 18 whatever but the developmental age<br>may be<br>a lot younger in any event<br>how have other communities responded to<br>fetal alcohol spectrum disorder as it<br>affects youth in the criminal justice<br>system so i propose to give you a few<br>examples now of programs<br>or projects that i've<br>observed or been exposed to<br>and then i'm going to talk about a few<br>broad themes and perhaps finish up with<br>a few questions that<br>try to turn those<br>statements of obligations into questions<br>that those of us who are interested in<br>there being appropriate intervention and<br>care<br>for young people affected by fasd might<br>reflect upon and utilise<br>in any advocacy or future action<br>okay so in several places in north<br>america<br>such as lethbridge alberta winnipeg in<br>manitoba and hennepin county in<br>minneapolis-st paul<br>programs which are aimed at identifying<br>and diverting fasd affected youth<br>involved in the criminal justice system<br>have been in place either for a fixed<br>period usually a pilot project something<br>like three years or in the case of<br>lethbridge<br>it's now been in place for ten years now<br>my apologies to those who came to<br>the presentation this morning because<br>the examples i'm going to give are<br>largely the examples that i gave this<br>morning<br>however<br>so lethbridge have a youth justice<br>program<br>it's emerged from<br>an fasd network established in the<br>community with various other<br>government agencies and non-government<br>agencies who've come together to focus<br>on fasd and how do they address<br>the issues for youth and adults<br>through the lifespan one of the outcomes<br>of that was to set up this<br>youth justice project<br>it involved<br>um<br>with in collaboration with the local<br>police force<br>that an experienced police officer was<br>designated as the fasd<br>police officer<br>and that police officer they've had<br>three i think in the course of 10 years<br>had the responsibili responsibility<br>of<br>receiving referrals which might come<br>from education they might come from<br>police officers<br>who've had some interaction with a young<br>person and either have charged them with<br>some offence or offenses or propose to<br>charge them<br>and the fasd police officer will then<br>look into the situation consult the<br>family any services in the community<br>might be consulting the school find out<br>whether the young person's been assessed<br>for fasd<br>if not see whether that can be organized<br>and given priority<br>link with another program in the<br>community the fasd key worker program<br>to see whether the family's got some<br>support whether<br>there needs to be negotiation with the<br>school about the school program it might<br>be that the child can't cope so they're<br>dropping out so there needs to be<br>negotiation with the school to<br>accommodate<br>the young person's<br>challenges limitations<br>it might be there needs to be some<br>external<br>day program<br>so the fasd police officer is really the<br>point of contact in the police<br>department<br>for<br>seeing whether there is some possibility<br>firstly of<br>diagnosing if there's no diagnosis so<br>it's clear for everyone<br>whether there is a diagnosis what that<br>really means in terms of the capacity<br>of the young person<br>and then trying to get them linked with<br>the relevant services in the community<br>so that they can be diverted from the<br>criminal justice program<br>now<br>the particular police officer who has<br>this role at the moment told me that<br>there are occasions when she negotiates<br>with the charging police officer<br>and<br>is able<br>having assembled some evidence<br>having made contact with various<br>agencies in the community and perhaps<br>having developed a plan in conjunction<br>with those<br>she's been able to get the charging<br>police officer<br>not to proceed with the charge to have<br>the young person diverted<br>into some program in the community or<br>have the charge dropped of course that<br>doesn't happen in every case nor would<br>it be necessarily appropriate in every<br>case<br>the police service have a system of<br>flagging an fasd affected person<br>in the police database now i acknowledge<br>there are privacy issues about that but<br>for the moment i'm going to sidestep<br>those<br>it's done with the permission only<br>with the permission of the carer of the<br>young person<br>but<br>the<br>system set up is because of that flag if<br>there's a new<br>interaction with the police by a young<br>person who's flagged in the system<br>then the fasd police officer will<br>receive an email so knows there's a new<br>interaction<br>and then can look into that and see what<br>needs to be done<br>it appears to be a very constructive<br>response<br>within the resources available in that<br>community<br>to<br>the<br>interaction of a young person affected<br>by fasd in the criminal justice system<br>now i've briefly referred to the key<br>worker program<br>that<br>operates<br>in various provinces in canada<br>and essentially it is a skilled<br>professional drawn from<br>education or<br>social sciences or<br>perhaps the psychology field<br>who has this role to work with young<br>essentially over an extended period of<br>time<br>work with them<br>to<br>and<br>better understand the implications of<br>that diagnosis<br>to<br>negotiate<br>with schools about accommodating<br>the school program for the particular<br>impairment of the young person<br>linking with other services in the<br>community everything from<br>respite to structured recreation<br>that might afford opportunities for<br>the young person to develop social<br>skills social relationships that are<br>positive and constructive<br>rather than negative<br>which often otherwise happens<br>that appears to be a very<br>constructive response<br>a family is not able<br>to deal with<br>all of the<br>behaviors and all of the issues that<br>arise at the same time<br>and over a period of time which may be<br>years<br>needs the<br>professional assistance of someone who<br>can<br>understand the diagnosis understand the<br>implications of it for the family work<br>with the family to accept and implement<br>that<br>uh work towards the implementation of<br>the recommendations<br>be a bridge<br>walk with them as they deal with the<br>various agencies to get the agencies to<br>understand they have to<br>accommodate<br>the particular impairment one of the<br>problems with this disability is there's<br>no one-size-fits-all<br>the brain damage varies from individual<br>to individual both in terms of the<br>nature of it<br>complexity<br>and<br>extent<br>which makes it<br>all the more difficult<br>now<br>one of the other programs a youth<br>justice program<br>established in winnipeg<br>sees<br>a small team of four<br>effectively community corrections<br>officers working with young people<br>who are already in the system<br>they require that there's evidence of<br>prenatal exposure and they have a fairly<br>blunt way of going about it they<br>describe to me<br>um that their practice is to contact the<br>carer the uh<br>i mean<br>there<br>um the biological mother of course it's<br>not always that but<br>in relation to the biological mother um<br>asking directly over the phone<br>whether she drank alcohol during the<br>course of pregnancy i was staggered by<br>that because<br>having talked to many<br>from the health and medical field<br>there's a lot of reticence about<br>asking<br>biological mothers about<br>their use of alcohol during pregnancy<br>anyway this team that i met with<br>said that in years of this practice<br>so long as it is approached gently<br>without judging<br>and it's put in the context of<br>if your child has fetal alcohol spectrum<br>disorder we offer ex service<br>but one of the criteria is<br>whether the young person was exposed to<br>alcohol<br>in a gentle unjudging way<br>they assure me they have never had<br>abuse down the line<br>on occasions<br>the woman doesn't tell them the truth or<br>doesn't want to discuss it which is<br>entirely her right<br>and they respect that<br>but<br>the<br>they also told me a tale of a young<br>person who persuaded his mother<br>to tell them that she had drunk during<br>pregnancy<br>because his mates were in this program<br>and it was a good program<br>and of course it came out later that<br>she hadn't drunk within pregnancy and so<br>he wasn't part of the program<br>but in any event this program<br>starts when<br>the young person enters the<br>criminal justice system and there's<br>either a diagnosis or there's a<br>suspicion<br>and they do<br>screening they talk to the mother or<br>carer<br>they get the child organized for a<br>diagnosis if that hasn't happened<br>and then<br>the first objective is to build a<br>trusting relationship with the young<br>person<br>and<br>often they told me often these young<br>people<br>have difficulties with social<br>constructive<br>uh social relationships<br>and<br>are<br>unused to<br>an adult person who is interested in<br>them and prepared to spend time with<br>them so they focus initially on the<br>developing the trust<br>sometimes that's done through food and<br>activities<br>and<br>they're<br>moving<br>to do a bail report to do a sentencing<br>report<br>that identifies<br>a plan for how to work with a young<br>person<br>if the ultimate sentence is custody then<br>they work with the young person whilst<br>they're in custody on the issues<br>identified in the pre-sentence report<br>and prepare them for transitioning<br>to the community so<br>it's an extended relationship it's not<br>you know three months or a few months<br>it's an extended relationship<br>uh winnipeg also has<br>a pilot project which is trying to<br>get<br>the alcohol and drug agencies to<br>adjust their way of working to cater for<br>fasd affected young people because many<br>of them have addictions issues<br>and<br>manitoba<br>as a province sees that<br>the alcohol and<br>substance abuse<br>agencies generally are unsuccessful in<br>engaging<br>this vulnerable population<br>now i wanted to turn to some themes that<br>programs or places<br>that are dealing with fasd and young<br>people<br>firstly<br>the importance of<br>having an fasd strategy<br>and not<br>i'm not simply talking about a strategy<br>at a local level<br>i'm talking about a strategy at a state<br>or provincial or national level<br>that involves<br>a detailed plan for how this challenge<br>is going to be met in the community<br>alberta the province of alberta adopted<br>a 10-year strategy seven years ago<br>and<br>it demonstrates how serious that<br>community is about<br>addressing the issue<br>it seems to have emerged from a<br>combination of advocacy<br>by adoptive<br>parents and carers<br>and the science health community that<br>had done a lot of research on the impact<br>of alcohol<br>on the brain<br>and also in alberta they have an<br>institute of health economics that<br>has undertaken research into the<br>uh cost of doing nothing versus the cost<br>of addressing the issue appropriately so<br>it adopted a strategy which was not<br>focused um simply on young people<br>but addressing fasd in the community<br>across the lifespan because of course<br>it's brain damage it doesn't stop when a<br>young person reaches the magic age of<br>majority whether that's 17 18 or 21<br>for their lifetime<br>now<br>alberta and manitoba have adopted these<br>strategies economically they've had<br>quite different<br>capacities to resource these strategies<br>um so alberta until you know the<br>pressure on the<br>oil price<br>has well<br>has had plenty of resources<br>and uh put a lot of money into<br>the fasd strategy<br>including<br>trying to train and skill up its<br>workforce identifying different parts of<br>the<br>um<br>sort of<br>agencies across the board whether it's<br>social workers in care and protection<br>or it's the police or judges or<br>you know frontline<br>workers in various agencies<br>over a number of years<br>training<br>and more training has been rolled out<br>in the department of care and protection<br>they<br>detailed and sophisticated training for<br>their frontline workers to be able to<br>identify early on with children coming<br>into care<br>the various issues including fasd<br>with a focus on early diagnosis early<br>intervention<br>so the strategy<br>involved leadership by government<br>at a cross cross-ministry level<br>so<br>collaboration is seen to be<br>hard to do but essential to achieve<br>and<br>also one of the important principles in<br>alberta's strategy<br>has been not to reinvent the wheel not<br>to resource<br>new<br>agencies who are just focused on fasd<br>but rather to skill up existing agencies<br>to deal with this population<br>in an appropriate way<br>they divided the province into 12<br>regions they resourced local fasd<br>networks being established to bring<br>together local providers and agencies<br>from the police to education etc<br>to work out on the ground what they<br>needed to do<br>to get diagnosis happening<br>to get appropriate intervention<br>happening<br>they recognized that systems needed to<br>change<br>if there was to be that collaboration<br>across<br>government and other agencies<br>and they recognize that the child has to<br>be the center<br>the child the brain damaged child or<br>adult is not going to be able to change<br>systems<br>often<br>have one way of delivering<br>the service and<br>the consumer is expected<br>to comply with the systems requirements<br>there's a recognition in alberta<br>that an fasd affected individual<br>has to be at the center there has to be<br>a<br>an approach by the agencies of um<br>focusing on the particular needs of that<br>individual and adjusting their service<br>delivery and collaboration<br>so as to be able to deliver<br>the service to the individual<br>now in manitoba with less resources<br>they've done things like<br>bring expert panels together in the<br>education sphere<br>so<br>for example in the primary and secondary<br>area<br>material for teachers who are<br>faced with the challenge<br>of<br>trying to<br>manage<br>that<br>comes with the<br>often the fasd affected<br>young person<br>these are invaluable materials<br>which<br>if you're so inclined<br>you could access by<br>going on to the healthy child<br>manitoba<br>website<br>um<br>i've have i've only touched on<br>diagnosis and assessment but that's<br>absolutely vital there's over 35 clinics<br>in<br>canada and that's not including mobile<br>clinics<br>but<br>assessment<br>is absolutely vital and it's recognised<br>at least in the western provinces<br>that they don't have enough capacity<br>that it's absolutely vital if<br>the<br>young person<br>is going to be able to<br>access<br>services<br>relevant to their needs<br>there are two areas which stand out as<br>being very significant problems<br>and that is managing support to young<br>people who are<br>leaving the care<br>system<br>and<br>at law<br>becoming adults<br>there and<br>across the provinces<br>uh that<br>meant in reality that whatever services<br>they'd been able to acc access as a<br>young person<br>stopped the minute they turned 18<br>and so there's a lot of focus now on how<br>do they<br>assist those young people to transition<br>through to<br>the adult services<br>the second significant problem that<br>seems to exist all over is having<br>accommodation of various types that is<br>housing of various types for fasd<br>affected youth and adults<br>now perhaps i've gone on too long but<br>can i<br>just try briefly at the end to try to<br>human rights instruments that i've made<br>brief reference to<br>to<br>well<br>to try to<br>translate to some extent<br>some of those obligations<br>on<br>states that have ratified them<br>into<br>questions for us as a community<br>who<br>are<br>interested and committed to<br>improving the outcomes for<br>young people affected by fasd and<br>improving<br>community protection<br>so<br>for example one of the questions is are<br>fisd affected youth receiving<br>special care and support so that they<br>can live<br>full and independent lives<br>our fasd affected children and youth<br>receiving an education which is<br>facilitating<br>the development of each child's<br>personality and talents<br>to the full<br>and when decisions are being made with<br>respect to children and youth who are<br>fasd affected<br>um<br>is the best interest of the particular<br>child<br>to the extent that systems be they<br>health education justice care and<br>protection<br>fail<br>to make services available to fasd<br>affected youth<br>which address their needs<br>in a timely manner<br>they are discriminating against youth<br>with that disability<br>and the particular nation state is in<br>breach of its international obligations<br>under the treaty<br>and maybe the subject of a complaint to<br>the u n committee<br>established by the relevant treaty<br>to monitor compliance and receive<br>complaints<br>and i'd remind you that signatories to<br>international human rights instruments<br>undertake to implement the obligations<br>and in this case i'm referring<br>particularly to the obligation to<br>prohibit discrimination on the basis of<br>disability and guarantee to persons with<br>disabilities equal and effective legal<br>protection against discrimination on all<br>grounds<br>i've raised the<br>international human rights<br>standards<br>so as to provide<br>another argument in our kit bag when it<br>comes to dealing with systems that are<br>slow to respond<br>to the needs of this vulnerable<br>population and governments that may be<br>slow to adopt a comprehensive strategy<br>and plan for tackling this issue and<br>fail to resource an effective response<br>while young people who are fasd affected<br>suffer injustice<br>major problem is the diagnosis seems to<br>me because only as i understand it only<br>30 percent of fasd people have their<br>facial features<br>and that leaves it to acknowledgement by<br>the<br>mother that<br>alcohol was consumed during pregnancy<br>and<br>with the resistance you've referred to<br>that can a<br>major issue okay i'm happy to answer<br>that but i would like to invite dr<br>valerie mcginn<br>um who's a neurologist to specifically<br>address the point that you're making if<br>you would like to<br>what we know with fasd is that the face<br>is irrelevant to the disability so<br>a child's face is not anything to do<br>with the disability it's just that there<br>is a point in time in gestation where<br>the face is affected<br>so diagnosis of fasd is the same as<br>diagnosis of any other disorder<br>there are recognized medical<br>procedures that we undertake and<br>that diagnosis should be available to<br>everyone it is<br>not unlike diagnosing autism or other<br>disabilities and we follow the canadian<br>guidelines to do that and unfortunately<br>in new zealand we don't have any<br>recognition of fasd as a disability or<br>much diagnostic capacity but it is<br>extreme i've diagnosed hundreds of<br>children when they're phased in it it's<br>not difficult once that's your specialty<br>field<br>but i think the kernel of the point<br>there is<br>that most don't have the facial features<br>and so if i'm sitting in court and i'm<br>uh in a busy list<br>and i'm seeing a succession of young<br>people<br>um it would me be a mistake for me to<br>think that i'm going to spot it or see<br>it<br>because mostly<br>no one sees it physically<br>it's the brain function that's the<br>overwhelming majority of those that have<br>fasd which makes it well one of the<br>aspects that make it so difficult in the<br>justice system for us to deal with it<br>and it's once you're used to talking<br>with women about alcohol it's not<br>actually difficult to get them to<br>disclose<br>alcohol consumption but it is a it is a<br>process that<br>requires<br>sort of medical expertise as such and<br>you know we do have screening tools that<br>could be used within the courts that<br>will raise the likelihood and<br>currently most of our referrals that we<br>get from the courts there's there's red<br>flags where judges or other people have<br>seen gosh this is looking a bit like<br>fasd<br>other questions<br>whose responsibility is it<br>which agency<br>to diagnose raise it or to to get a<br>diagnosis of diet yeah well i mean it's<br>a health problem so it should be with<br>available within the health system but<br>you know the thing is that it becomes<br>the responsibility of whichever agency<br>that person's presenting and so if the<br>person is presenting in the courts the<br>courts have provisions to order<br>assessments to<br>identify the needs of the young person<br>so that they can be accommodated within<br>the law so in that case the courts may<br>order an assessment if a child is young<br>they might come through the child<br>development service at the local<br>hospital they often come through the<br>mental health services because their<br>behaviours are difficult um therefore<br>there is no particular one person who<br>should be taking this on entirely on<br>their own i think it's something that<br>needs to be spread across<br>the idea of course would be if we had<br>child development services picking all<br>of our children up when they're young<br>and then we wouldn't get them appearing<br>as often in the courts but<br>um i think they need to be recognised<br>where they come up whether it's a<br>homeless person or it's a person with an<br>addiction services<br>yeah yeah okay i was told the ministry<br>of education today was responsible well<br>the ministry of education have got some<br>responsibility for the education of the<br>child and so therefore they do have to<br>adapt their procedures around a child's<br>disability so often the school is a very<br>good place to pick it up absolutely<br>no but we have educational psychologists<br>that are trained to do it so um you know<br>i think everyone it's it's it's<br>everyone's problem it's<br>it's everywhere so everyone should be<br>contributing<br>um<br>and i think there is a big um<br>the schools are picking up um a lot of<br>um<br>behavioural problems and recognizing<br>you mentioned different ages of the<br>majority obviously in different<br>countries<br>obviously 17 which is reasonably<br>contentious i was just wondering if you<br>speak to the relevance of that and<br>in the epa esd stuff does it play a role<br>um<br>i<br>i don't think the particular age plays a<br>role but it's a marker in each society<br>of<br>majority maturity<br>adulthood<br>and it seems that many societies will<br>have services for young people<br>that will then stop you know whether<br>it's 17 or 18<br>and they<br>will have a whole suite of other<br>services or not<br>for adults<br>and<br>my perception is in this particular<br>field<br>many have concentrated on getting<br>diagnosis and services<br>for young people<br>for various reasons<br>and<br>adults<br>that may have fasd a large part have<br>been ignored<br>but there are certain<br>examples in north america<br>where they've made<br>a commitment to try to service that<br>population as well<br>whitehorse in the yukon being one of<br>them and<br>alberta they they see it as across the<br>lifespan there's got to be diagnosis and<br>services<br>which really reflects<br>uh the commitment to respect and<br>inherent dignity of the individual<br>on behalf of the audience can i please<br>ask you to<br>extend<br>your appreciation to what has been a<br>very very rich and interesting and<br>detailed talk so please show our thanks<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
