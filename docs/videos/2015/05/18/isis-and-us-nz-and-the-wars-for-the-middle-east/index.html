ambitions and having committed every crime imaginable against humanity - by helping fight them, we get involved in the Middle East in a complicated set of wars, without any idea of what a settlement or peace looks like.<br><br>This being so, the question is, should NZ being sending troops at all?<br><br>In his public lecture, The University of Waikato's Professor Gillespie outlined reasons for and against New Zealand involvement in the fight against ISIS, and offered solutions for solving the current crisis in the Middle East.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

um<br>housekeeping matters to deal with just<br>before I introduce um Al um cell phones<br>please check your cell phones and make<br>sure they're on<br>silent um bathrooms if you need to use<br>the bathroom they're across from the<br>bar and the um if there's an emergency<br>do uh my name is Wayne rumbles I am the<br>acting dean of um tiing faculty of Law<br>and it is um it is with great pleasure<br>that I introduce my colleague and friend<br>Professor Al Gillespie Al graduated from<br>ockland University faculty of law with<br>an LLB and a masters of Law and he went<br>on to complete a doctorate at Nottingham<br>University Al joined tiing a faculty war<br>of law here at wau in 1995 as an<br>academic where he got to teach some<br>excellent students including myself um<br>and he currently holds holds a position<br>as Pro Vice Chancellor research El was<br>awarded the Fullbright scholar<br>scholarship um in um 1998 taken at the<br>law school of Columbia in New York and<br>the Rockefeller SC Fellowship in 2001 in<br>Italy and the New Zealand law foundation<br>and international research Fellowship in<br>2004<br>for Al is often sought um after by the<br>media for expert comment in his areas of<br>expertees more recently Al has had made<br>numerous TV and National radio<br>appearances speaking on the war in the<br>Middle East and<br>Isis Al is internationally published and<br>specializes in international and<br>domestic environmental law and policy<br>and has written extensively in the areas<br>of climate change biodiversity and<br>satation conservation as students used<br>to call him the<br>whalan more recently Al has turned his<br>research focus on the armed on armed<br>conflict and the legal Frameworks which<br>surround or should surround such<br>conflicts as well as its geopolitical<br>context arising from this research Focus<br>has been a three volume work entitled<br>history of laws history of the laws of<br>war which traces the origins of the<br>modern law of warfare from the earliest<br>times to present day and he has<br>published the first of a four volume<br>series titled the causes of War U the<br>second um will be out at the end of the<br>year and as he's a pretty much of a<br>multitasker he's also a keen<br>Surfer it gives me great pleasure to<br>welcome Professor Al Gillespie to<br>address us on his insights on why or why<br>not New Zealand should be involved um in<br>the fight against Isis I am sure L's<br>talk will generate lots of questions and<br>comments um and there will be time at<br>the end of the talk so please hold um<br>your questions until after the talk uh<br>because we are streaming on um live on<br>YouTube If answering questions you will<br>need to use the microphone so at the end<br>um if you put up your hand we'll make<br>sure the microphone um comes to you so<br>without any further Ado and bring on Al<br>Al um good evening it's really good to<br>see so many of you here tonight it's a<br>wet night and it's um hard to it's hard<br>to get out of home when it's this bad as<br>it is but to see this many people<br>tonight it's encourag and I gave this<br>lecture last week in Tanga and we had a<br>similar sized audience and it's it's<br>indicative of how much the population<br>and how much people are actually caring<br>about this issue and it's an important<br>issue because it it's unlike anything<br>we've had to do for a long time that<br>that decision of whether whether we<br>should go to war now my my talk tonight<br>is going to be for about 20 25 minutes<br>and then we'll have questions afterwards<br>I do not intend it to be pical I don't<br>with a lot of things I do I don't try to<br>come out on left or right so those who<br>are going to behead me for going for war<br>or those who are going to behead me for<br>not going for war will be disappointed<br>but there will be a third cue for my<br>indecision which will be over there<br>towards halfway time um this topic<br>Islamic State it it's a difficult topic<br>it's we weren't meant to be here a lot<br>of um I've known Wayne for for decades<br>now and some of you um closer to my age<br>and you remember the Cold War and you<br>remember those days when the Cold War<br>ended just that euphoria that that we<br>were going to live happily ever after<br>and like the Soviet Union disappeared<br>and Bill Clinton came to town and it was<br>me it was a days of excitement and<br>happiness and then we kind of went<br>through a few bumps at the end of the<br>1990s and then we got into the new<br>century and then we had the Arab Spring<br>and it was meant to be a time when<br>democracy and freedom and open markets<br>were going to go Global and so all of<br>those terrible people that we'd seen in<br>the 1980s and actually going back<br>earlier to the 1920s that the um<br>dynasties strong men families of based<br>around purely around<br>power we thought they were all going to<br>go away we thought it would be like<br>Pac-Man going through the Middle East<br>and you we we saw Gaddafi disappear we<br>saw Hussein disappear we saw Assad get<br>get challenged or Sadat and and the idea<br>was that we were all going to live<br>happily ever after because the Cold War<br>was over the the Arab Spring was going<br>to come into the the full summer but it<br>hasn't ended up like that so something<br>went wrong along the way and so now you<br>get to the point where you you wake up<br>in the morning or you watch the news at<br>night and you get confronted with this<br>bewildering collection of acronyms and<br>foreign names and we've almost become<br>immune I I um I do a lot of media and<br>and when the when the first Terror<br>attacks were starting um and from 2006<br>you know you would have one busload of<br>40 people get machine guned it would be<br>just everywhere and it would be the<br>topic for the week last night 40 Shia 40<br>Shia got machine gun in Pakistan and it<br>gets one little by line and and we've<br>become immune to atrocity and it's every<br>day and so the these are just the what<br>what we've got on the one side so um B<br>Haram Al Shabah Al-Qaeda Islamic State<br>that just these are the the things to<br>note about this current collection is um<br>they're all radical Sunni so they're one<br>side of the the Muslim faith that they<br>basically divide into two parts there's<br>and at the moment there's a rough<br>cooperation going on between them but<br>there is a turf war between Al-Qaeda and<br>Islamic State bah Haram sides with<br>Islamic State al- Shabah sides with<br>Al-Qaeda the difference between them is<br>um Al-Qaeda tries to set itself up as<br>like the gold standard of terrorism I'm<br>not making that up it's like that they<br>they have more standards the al-Qaeda<br>was responsible for the Twin Towers um<br>the attack uh on Charlie ibdo and Paris<br>they're more refined more disciplined<br>Islamic state is more stet they're<br>rougher they're without the refinement<br>They're Not So based um around Arab<br>culture they're broader they like to see<br>themselves as more cosmopolit and more<br>appealing to a wider<br>class<br>and<br>they're different to the others our<br>Islamic State which is the one I'm going<br>to mainly talk about because that's the<br>one that New Zealand is going to be is<br>involved in a war with now is different<br>to alqa primarily because um through<br>algardi they are seeking a caliphate<br>which which is effectively where one man<br>is the political and religious leader of<br>the entire Muslim Community now<br>caliphates aren't new in history there's<br>been a sucess session of them but this<br>current caliphate which has been called<br>for is the first one for a number of<br>centuries to be coming through so that<br>is new and that is<br>different and here we are and so this<br>this we we're watching this war from<br>afar like we do as New Zealand is safely<br>at the bottom of the South Pacific our<br>little corner and all of a sudden you<br>become aware that things are changing<br>and you pick up your time magazines and<br>you pick up your Economist and you can<br>see this threat<br>growing something's big and then the<br>Iraqi foreign minister um decided to to<br>fly all the way from Iraq down to<br>Australia and to New Zealand bypassing<br>all the Muslim countries on the way like<br>um Indonesia or Malaysia and coming<br>direct to us and asked us for help and<br>we've ended up being part of the<br>Coalition which you can see on the the<br>picture in the bottom leftand corner and<br>it's a broad-based coalition it's<br>largely Western it's largely based<br>around the United States<br>um France uh Britain obviously part of<br>Scandinavia how good for Australia and a<br>few Sunny based countries in the Middle<br>East and so the request was made for us<br>to contribute and after much<br>consideration John Key decided to<br>provide 142 soldiers as the to train the<br>Iraqi Army um I should explain now that<br>my view is what if you're training the<br>Army you're in the war you it's a false<br>division to say that we're only training<br>guys who do the fighting we are now<br>engaged in a war with Islamic State but<br>we've got a the minimum commitment<br>compared to what our neighbors are doing<br>and the other countries and the other<br>countries I'll talk about it later but<br>they're upping they anti in terms of the<br>the geographical space that they're inly<br>from um the West so to speak like uh<br>Europe but the mainly the main foreign<br>volunteers who are not from Syria or<br>from Iraq are coming from Turkey they're<br>coming from um Tunisia and they're<br>coming from Egypt the difficulty with<br>the foreign Fighters number is it's a<br>guesstimate but the bigger number that<br>we don't talk about is how many how many<br>fighters are on the ground and so if you<br>ask the Kurdish fighters who are fight<br>in the front line right now they're<br>going to tell you Islamic state is at<br>least 200,000 people and so to focus on<br>the foreign Fighters is one thing but<br>the reason there are so many domestic<br>Fighters is is twofold one the pole of<br>Fighters who have exactly the same<br>religious IDE ideology um potential<br>coming through from Saudi Arabia is up<br>to 4 million and even within the<br>countries that are occupied like within<br>Iraq you go into a city like mosul which<br>is already a Sunni based City there's<br>1.8 million people there there's<br>unemployment in excess of 50% and the<br>Islamic state is now paying a rate for<br>their soldiers which is greater than the<br>Iraqi Army and so there's no shortage of<br>volunteers and so the numbers are very<br>large<br>the Battleground where where our<br>soldiers are going into the it's<br>important to realize that the war in<br>Iraq is also the war in Syria although<br>there's a line being divided between<br>them at the moment they are essentially<br>exactly the same<br>conflict to put this into some kind of<br>context there since World War II your<br>two biggest conflicts where there's been<br>over a million dead in the conflict with<br>the Vietnam War and then the Afghanistan<br>war between the Soviet Union and the<br>mujahadin in the<br>1980s post those two Wars this is the<br>biggest war we' have seen since since<br>the end of the Cold War so if you went<br>into the Balkans with former Yugoslavia<br>about 140,000 dead if you go into<br>Afghanistan with America post 2001 about<br>30,000 dead this um sedan 200,000 dead<br>what's going on in Syria is<br>unprecedented since the end of the Cold<br>War at least 250,000 dead now and 4<br>million plus refugees now just over the<br>Border um you have Iraq now the the Iraq<br>war is pretty difficult to say when did<br>it actually start and when did it finish<br>the thing with an Iraqi soldier or a<br>potential Soldier right now in Islamic<br>State if they are my age they is a very<br>good chance they fought in the Iraq Iran<br>War in the 1980s they fought against<br>America in 1991 with the invasion of<br>Kuwait they fought in the 2003 Uprising<br>against the American Invasion then and<br>they're continuing to fight now and so<br>the Iraqi soldier it's not just the<br>young guys who look really fantastic and<br>kind of scary and kind of weird as well<br>that you see with Islamic State it's the<br>established Soldier as well behind them<br>and so these are very seasoned Fighters<br>these are not young or novice the death<br>the death toll you can see for Iraq<br>going since 2003 with the American<br>invasion is probably about 130,000 plus<br>2 million plus refugees<br>now on so you within those two countries<br>you're getting close to nearly 400,000<br>dead in the space of a couple of years<br>and on top of that you've got 6 million<br>plus refugees and this is why it's<br>another topic all together but we are<br>facing a refugee crisis at the moment<br>unlike anything we' have seen since the<br>second world war there are more refugees<br>than at any point since<br>1945 and it's refugees tend to go and<br>they're growing anyway because of<br>economic considerations and<br>environmental considerations but with<br>war you always see kind of a a Splurge<br>like when you had the Vietnam War you<br>had the boat people and you're seeing it<br>now so if you want to actually stop all<br>these people who are drowning in the<br>Mediterranean and you're looking at<br>thousands of people now it it it's<br>remarkable you've got to stop the war in<br>Iraq you've got to stop the war in Syria<br>you got to stop the war in Libya because<br>otherwise this problem will continue to<br>grow in<br>itself um so now the first part of my<br>argument why why should we be involved<br>and so it's um the first reason you want<br>to be involved is that the caliphate has<br>goals of Conquest which are Regional and<br>if not International and so what they're<br>intending they they work on a principle<br>of what was once Islamic land um and<br>this is at the height of the the<br>Muslim empire so to speak although was<br>always broken up in different sulat and<br>parts is at the end of the 9th century<br>and then going through so so they're<br>intending to reclaim obviously you can<br>see Spain you can see Hungary you can<br>see Greece not to mention most of um<br>Africa down to the tropical belt and um<br>a larger part of going through um<br>usbekistan<br>aaban all the way through to India it's<br>huge so so their goals are not about<br>let's just get Syria or let's get Iraq<br>their goals are very big second<br>reason James Foley David Haynes Steven<br>stoff alen Henning Kenji goo Kyla<br>Mueller we've all seen it we've all seen<br>this this one particular act designed to<br>shock us into responding<br>differently so your your reason here for<br>why you want to get involved is that<br>international law and Humanity over a<br>period of thousands of years has created<br>laws of war we all broadly know now what<br>you can and cannot do in a conflict most<br>of us can muddle our way through it the<br>point with Islamic state is that they<br>don't care all of the rules of War are<br>just been put in the bin because Islamic<br>state is working by rules that come from<br>their interpretation of the Quran and<br>they have no respect for the Geneva<br>conventions or any of the hag protocols<br>or anything so this means that crimes<br>against humanity your first reason they<br>don't respect Humanity this is this is<br>just the execution this is not talking<br>about the the extreme problem of rape<br>and the occupied territories but your<br>second reason your second crime against<br>humanity<br>genocide we know that they the way that<br>traditional groups within this Paradigm<br>work is that if you not a person of the<br>book and the person of the book is<br>either you are you are um Christian or<br>you are Jewish then if you are not a<br>person of the book you have no standing<br>whatsoever you effectively a almost a<br>pagan and the obligation is to carry out<br>War to the utmost extreme against pagans<br>and so this means that for certain<br>people like the yazidi the the the<br>intention is to destroy and fall or in<br>part that ethnic group and they're<br>either doing it intentionally or they'll<br>do it through recklessness or they'll do<br>it through negligence by pushing them<br>out into the desert and so we see crimes<br>of<br>genocide we know that they don't take<br>prisoners so like in any other conflict<br>if you are a soldier and you surrender<br>you have a whole series of rights that<br>go back hundreds of years that you are<br>allowed to be kept alive we we know that<br>Islamic State don't take prisoners<br>whether they're military prisoners or of<br>um a different ethnic group a different<br>religious group or here you can see the<br>um the pilot who was from Jordan who was<br>um sorry from Emirates who who was burnt<br>alive Jordan I apologize yeah it was<br>from Jordan and again the same principle<br>though that none of the prisoners have<br>any<br>rights we see it with the cultural<br>destruction and again we we<br>see you this is not unique to destroy<br>someone else's culture it's um we saw it<br>again with Al-Qaeda um and Afghanistan<br>and the Buddhas it's you often see it in<br>periods of Revolution where people<br>destroy other people's culture but again<br>you seeing here not just the destruction<br>of opposing Shia um mosques you're also<br>seeing the destruction of traditional<br>cultures outside of and previous to<br>Christianity and then the final reason<br>that we need to be thinking about this<br>is that even if you are not not<br>interested in all this war and you want<br>to close your eyes and say I want it all<br>just to go away it won't because as much<br>as you aren't interested in them I can<br>assure you they are interested in you so<br>you might be having your coffee in<br>Sydney or you might be driving your car<br>in Britain you might be going to a very<br>controversial art show in Texas or you<br>might be publishing a magazine in Paris<br>and so the terrorism is coming towards<br>us and so even if we don't want to be<br>interested in them they are interested<br>in changing the way that we<br>live so those to me are very good<br>arguments those are you've got you've<br>got a group which is going to be<br>Regional if not Global and its<br>aspirations there is no crime of war or<br>crime against humanity that they have<br>not committed and they're at the<br>Forefront of terrorism those are good<br>reasons to get involved these now are<br>the arguments of why not to be involved<br>take a step back who are you defending<br>in World War I we got we got involved in<br>the conflict because we went originally<br>to defend Belgium and we knew what<br>Belgium was in World War II we got<br>involved we went to defend Poland and we<br>knew that the values of what Poland was<br>meant to do and so but when you get<br>involved in a country like Iraq look at<br>its human rights record its human rights<br>record is atrocious look at the problem<br>it has with corruption and then look at<br>all of the factors that actually gave<br>rise to the Islamic State in the first<br>place the sectarian politics and the<br>policies that they had to make sure that<br>certain people were excluded from<br>government and from<br>power in many ways when you look at the<br>Iraqi Army this this is one of the this<br>was one of the best armies ever made<br>post 2004 the Americans spent 25 billion<br>dollars rebuilding the Iraqi Army it did<br>not run away for lack of men it did not<br>run away for lack of weapons it ran away<br>for lack of identity and lack of spirit<br>and so you have to think are we willing<br>to defend this country which has so many<br>problems are these the values that we<br>aspire<br>to Second reason you don't want to be<br>involved in this if this war is as<br>serious as you're saying Al this should<br>be at the UN we think of all the recent<br>Wars like we can think about that we've<br>been involved in we've been involved in<br>Kuwait we've been involved in East Teo<br>Afghanistan and the sadan and the<br>security Council says this is a threat<br>to International Peace and security put<br>on the blue helmets use force whereby<br>all of the soldiers go forward under the<br>international flag of the United<br>Nations and at the moment this is not a<br>un War this is a bilateral War this is<br>the war like Vietnam where we pulled in<br>by old alliances or this is a war like<br>Afghanistan for the Soviets this is a<br>traditional War because the<br>international Machinery is broken the<br>Security Council is not working at the<br>moment because of another conflict going<br>on with Putin and the difficulty here is<br>that because Putin has got<br>another conflict and we have a conflict<br>in the Ukraine and there's already<br>economic sanctions going over this which<br>may be renewed and the Ukraine sits on a<br>very fragile balance it means that<br>whenever we try to progress this at the<br>security Council and say this is an<br>international threat to all people The<br>veto will go up because they've got no<br>no intention of letting this be an<br>international solution because if you're<br>trying to exploit or hurt the West this<br>is one of the best ways you can do it<br>you can let this problem continue to<br>bleed and you must remember also that<br>Putin is personally responsible for the<br>the protection of Assad in Syria and for<br>a very strong economic and Military<br>Support for Iran as well and so Putin<br>and Russia um has defense alliances and<br>responsibilities which mean that they<br>will not allow the International<br>Community to get<br>involved why else don't you want to be<br>involved this is a war of proxies<br>there's you know we might want to dress<br>this up as Islamic State and we might<br>want to dress this up as the defense of<br>a country which has had its borders<br>invaded or has been internally destroyed<br>but in many ways what's going on right<br>now is that this is Saudi Arabia and<br>this is Qatar and this is Turkey on one<br>side and this is Iran on the other and<br>we are seeing that in many ways that<br>these two parts and so even though we<br>are getting involved in fighting Islamic<br>State the contribution of Saudi Arabia<br>the contribution of Qatar and<br>contribution of turkey is that big it's<br>tiny and they're busy very much on<br>besides doing other things and we're<br>beginning to see that conflict now<br>breaking out in Yemen and so why don't<br>you want to be involved because this<br>isn't you could argue our fight this is<br>a fight which has much deeper Roots<br>two why not be involved we don't know<br>what peace looks like we've got no idea<br>a lot of people are going to say look<br>let's get involved in this conflict<br>let's we've got do it these are terrible<br>people but what are you going to do<br>about Syria we know what we're going to<br>do about Iraq we we've kind of got an<br>idea that you want to rebalance it we<br>don't know how we're going to do it but<br>we rebalance it what do you do with<br>Syria you've got 250,000 people plus<br>you've got a stalemate in the war you've<br>got four different<br>sides are you going to divide the<br>country are you going to insist Assad<br>goes out are you going to support the<br>Rebel Alliance the ones that not the<br>ones out of Star Wars but the ones out<br>of the ones that Obama is currently<br>supporting who do we do it we we we're<br>not sure and then when we start to think<br>about even deeper questions not just<br>with regard to Syria but what does the<br>Middle East look like you know the<br>Middle East that we've got at the moment<br>is largely a creation of the League of<br>Nations in 1919 and then subsequent<br>treaties in the 1930s where we drew<br>lines over what what became um Iraq what<br>became Saudi what became Syria what<br>became Israel do we need to rethink do<br>you want an independent Kurdistan do you<br>want to move one population to another<br>area I'm not saying here what the answer<br>is but we need to know what peace looks<br>like we need to we need a bigger<br>objective than just saying we're<br>fighting Islamic State and people need<br>to be turning their minds to do you want<br>an independent<br>kistan but we're not asking those<br>questions right now we're just thinking<br>fight and here's your last reason why<br>you don't want to be<br>involved this is just the beginning<br>if our professed enemy is Islamic State<br>we now know that it's like the game that<br>you used to be able to play um whacka do<br>you remember wacka mall and and you had<br>this club and you you hit this little<br>thing um this machine and one would go<br>down and another mole would come up<br>outwhere and You' hit that and then two<br>would come up and we hit it again and<br>someone come elsewhere Islamic state is<br>now moving around and so if our<br>professed enemy is in Islam is in Iraq<br>what are you going to do when they as<br>they are now in Yemen what are you going<br>to do when they appear in Egypt what are<br>you going to do when they appear in<br>Libya th those two in particular just<br>think about we all Libya is now pretty<br>close to being a failed State and as<br>much as we we we're pretty certain that<br>in 2003 the forces that you're now<br>fighting with Islamic State were largely<br>the rebels who fought against the<br>Americans in 2003 when if they get<br>beaten when or if they get beaten they<br>move they go back into the communities<br>or they go to another country and so if<br>we want to be thinking about fighting<br>Islamic state is the next stop for the<br>New Zealand soldiers in Libya is the<br>next stop in Yemen Islamic state has<br>said that its preferred Target is Saudi<br>Arabia and Saudi Arabia of course is a<br>monarchy and very fragile monarchy what<br>happens when they get their teeth into<br>that place do we go there as well so<br>blit that's so<br>and and and so I'm I'm going to so I I<br>turn up to all of these places and it's<br>this is not a clearcut war this just<br>simply isn't a clear cut War you know<br>that that your basic problems is you<br>have the ultimate bad guy you have the<br>ultimate bad guy these guys are the<br>fascists of the 21st century there is no<br>crime they have not committed and on the<br>other side you've got a non-u war you<br>don't know what peace looks like and it<br>could go either way<br>anyway from that now I'm going to take<br>some questions after this but before I<br>do I'm just curious hands up for<br>intervention hands up who who thinks the<br>there hands up for not being<br>involved yep that that's pretty much<br>what I've seen around the country it's<br>pretty it's a it's a 5050 call no matter<br>where we go okay so we're going to do<br>some questions um so we've got these two<br>viewpoints of jumping right into the<br>middle of everything or standing all the<br>way back and seeing what happens either<br>way but what if we could have somewh of<br>being involved in more like ring fencing<br>the situation so rather than jumping<br>into the middle stand on the outside and<br>contained where it<br>is this is a very strong argument that<br>that we should actually be involved in<br>the humanitarian help that we should<br>rather than send in our soldiers to<br>train their soldiers we should be doing<br>more in terms of Aid in terms of civil<br>infrastructure and trying to sort like<br>build a better version of Iraq that's<br>that's a very powerful argument but some<br>people would argue the opposite thing is<br>that even though even though the<br>international Machinery is broken the<br>the moral responsibility to actually get<br>involved in the fight is what we should<br>do that it shouldn't I would suggest it<br>shouldn't be seen as an either or I mean<br>one of the things I've been arguing<br>about recently is that as much as we<br>should if we do get involved in the<br>fight then as a minimum the first step<br>we should do is to more<br>refugees but it you shouldn't need to<br>sort like say one or the other but the<br>the degree that we're involved in the<br>fight is the absolute minimum John ke<br>could not have put a smaller<br>contribution on the table compared to<br>like what the other what the other<br>countries are doing right now and so<br>like the the Australians have got like<br>900 troops over there they've got<br>airplanes over there as well they're<br>they're actively bombing the big thing<br>to watch right now with what our allies<br>are going to be doing is that Canada is<br>now on record for saying that they also<br>want to get get involved militarily<br>against Syria Australia hasn't but now<br>that Canada will join the war against<br>Syria it means that the war morphs<br>between one enemy and another enemy but<br>the bigger area of concern is that there<br>is a ground swell of opinion in the<br>United States for boots on the ground<br>and so the Americans are now saying we<br>think we've got Islamic State on the Run<br>let's get out all of our soldiers in<br>there and if that if that becomes a<br>policy then you'll find a lot more<br>momentum on John ke's store and knocking<br>more than 442 soldiers what was the<br>question up the bank um my question<br>would be about just like do you think<br>the real Isis is America itself like do<br>you do you think they the one who are<br>actually helping Isis to fight the Iraqi<br>government and Iraqi people to reach<br>their own Targets in Iraq like they did<br>in Afghanistan I'm I'm actually from<br>Afghanistan like when Americans invaded<br>and Afghanistan they actually helped the<br>Afghan majah over the Afghan Taliban to<br>the Russians in Afghanistan so their<br>goal was not to help Afghanistan people<br>their goal was to uh take the Russian<br>out of Afghanistan which which cost a<br>life of 30 to 40 thousands of African<br>people and a lot of people a lot of<br>people from Afghanistan fed their house<br>and fleed the country to come to<br>countries like New Zealand and Australia<br>do you think that's the same thing<br>that's happening in Iraq right now so do<br>you think that America is behind the I<br>is taking to reach their own targets and<br>go in Iraq and one other point did you<br>said that J has deployed 40 soldiers in<br>Iraq to the train with the with the<br>Iraqi soldier they did drunky said the<br>same thing to New Zealand people when he<br>say 140 soldier in Afghanistan and the<br>and he said that the role of the uh Army<br>will be to to train the Afghan Army I<br>actually used to work for the New<br>Zealand army in Afghanistan and every<br>day they were involved in uh fighting<br>killing so they were not there to train<br>the Afghan Army which is saying that J<br>uh that doing in Iraq thank you um<br>I I I would say it's a very big question<br>um first of all with the Iraqi<br>Army I'll work backwards there is a very<br>big risk at the moment that the Iraqi<br>Army will behave without any recourse to<br>restraint or the rules of war and their<br>Reliance upon some of the the Shia based<br>militia coming across from Iran is a<br>great concern because this will only<br>spread the cerian<br>conflict the point about America's<br>involvement in this I would I would<br>suggest that the the invasion of<br>Afghanistan in 2001 was a un authorized<br>mandated Mission and and so I haven't<br>got so many questions over the legality<br>of that the one in 2003 was clearly<br>illegal with the invasion of Iraq I have<br>got issues with that there's a<br>difficulty in trying to disentangle at<br>this point where fault begins over<br>because we can say it was with with<br>regards to Iraq at what point of History<br>we all got a a favorite point that we go<br>to that and in some ways we need to be<br>cognizant of the history because yes<br>there is fault and there is fingerprints<br>over a lot of the mistakes in the past<br>but we've still got to deal with the<br>present and what's happening now but one<br>point I will draw out is with regard to<br>Islamic State and terrorism in general<br>is that it works by trying to F us<br>terrorism works on a lot of publicity<br>and trying to draw an extremely strong<br>response because the stronger the<br>response the more likely that you'll<br>have a reprisal which is like a really<br>heavy-handed action and that will<br>generate Sympathy for the terrorist<br>group Islamic State wants that to happen<br>and so you can have a situation<br>whereby Obama should I would have argued<br>Obama should have got involved in Syria<br>when Assad used chemical weapons on his<br>own people but the American Congress<br>said fight and so he he's a side gassing<br>his own people but when Islamic State<br>beheaded Steven Foley on TV and killed<br>one man Islamic State made enemy of 250<br>million Americans and so that response<br>often if it's disproportionate will end<br>up creating the enemy that you want to<br>defeat the importance right now in<br>fighting the enemy and also in the way<br>that we deal with the threat of<br>terrorism at home is we need to be more<br>conscious of our human rights and our<br>civil rights than ever before because<br>the more you stand on people's rights<br>create yeah okay uh I wanted to uh ask<br>you a question along the lines of<br>religion being involved unlike Ukraine<br>we can see that this is a faith-based<br>war with a book of which both the Shia<br>and the uh sunnis believe a God is<br>showing them the way the truth and it<br>intrigues me as to how we can enter a<br>war when we're identified with<br>Christianity particularly in America<br>where 75% of people believe in a God and<br>a Christian uh belief therefore if we<br>join in a war we will be seen by the<br>whole of the Arab states to be morally<br>using Christianity as a way of defeating<br>their enemy and I think this is going to<br>uh turn doing things against us without<br>doubt the Islamic state is making a<br>great play upon religious identity and<br>it's trying to portray those very much<br>against them either as Heretics um which<br>are the Shia as as pagans or as<br>Crusaders I um don't buy into this<br>terminology I I think for if we get<br>involved and America gets involved I<br>don't see us getting involved as<br>Christians I see us getting involved as<br>nation states in the 21st century which<br>should be largely sectarian which are<br>governed by rules of universal<br>applicability but having said that you<br>you are correct that there is a large<br>religious base to this conflict and the<br>larger base is not between Islam and<br>Christianity the larger basis of this<br>conflict is between Shia and Sunni or<br>primarily between Iran and the other<br>countries around it particularly Saudi<br>Arabia Egypt and Qatar there is a risk<br>and there is a strong amount of<br>provocation going on to try to turn this<br>into a complete sectarian conflict and<br>at the moment and this is one of the<br>good reasons a good reason to get<br>involved is to try to keep them apart or<br>a mental reason to get involved to try<br>to keep them apart you can cut it both<br>ways because one way or another the<br>these two sides and we we've seen that<br>they are fighting by proxy with in Iraq<br>and in Syria you are getting the Shia<br>based on one side or Shia based aligned<br>and the broadly Sony groups and now also<br>in Yemen to even larger degree you're<br>seeing it again and we're seeing the the<br>extremist um be it Al-Qaeda or be it<br>Islamic State doing remarkably evil<br>things like blowing up each other's<br>mosques or just targeting people because<br>of their religious identity and so yes<br>you're right there is a lot of religion<br>in<br>this oh I'll just so they can see me no<br>sure um just um three questions if I may<br>you<br>may short<br>ones one is do you perhaps believe that<br>countries that have a better human<br>rights record when involved in war<br>should as a matter of fact train this<br>kind of armies in that kind of behavior<br>I've seen that happening in my own<br>country Colombia and it's wor to an<br>extent yes that's question number one<br>the answer is yes I I I my view is that<br>if our soldiers should carry our values<br>and the sense that they should be there<br>not only to to further the military<br>objectives but also the social<br>objectives as well and so and<br>particularly with regards to the Iraqi<br>Army that means teaching them the<br>importance of the rules of War and the<br>importance of Human Rights because I<br>would it's a different topic but I you<br>can't make peace without human rights<br>you can't make peace with minorities are<br>respected now number two uh is is the<br>divided opinion about whether you send<br>soldiers or you send Aid and I say why<br>not send both it would be like um I<br>don't know having someone who killed uh<br>their one of their children and only<br>send it a social worker but not sending<br>the police so would you believe that<br>that is a much better option just<br>actually committing to more than just<br>war and actually committing to war and a<br>big humanitarian effort into building a<br>better<br>Society<br>we that questions for the audience you<br>know whether we should get more involved<br>militarily or whether we should get less<br>involved but I would suggest we're only<br>at the beginning of this and that<br>there's a very good chance that this<br>will get escalate that the question is<br>how much we want to get stuck in the<br>middle of it and the arguments are both<br>ways I mean like you know these guys are<br>the perfect enemy they are they are<br>truly evil but whether you want to get<br>in front of them when there's no obvious<br>exit point but then we faced exactly the<br>same argument in 1939 with you with the<br>League of Nations didn't work and you<br>had the rise of fascism what do you do<br>do you get involved or do you stay<br>back third question<br>uh and this could be just your personal<br>opinion but do you believe the New<br>Zealand government perhaps it a<br>country's effort to have all of these<br>factors taken into account before making<br>that<br>commitment could you rephrase the<br>question please would you like would you<br>say perhaps your opinion uh that the New<br>Zealand government took into account all<br>the factors perhaps to expand even more<br>to commit the<br>troops no your your opin<br>no no um I I've had the luxury of<br>working in New Zealand government in<br>various parts and no that um the thing<br>that concerned me there's a lot of<br>things that concerned me with regards to<br>the way that New Zealand went to war and<br>the biggest thing that concerned me most<br>of all was when JY announced that we're<br>going as part of the club now the the<br>the difficulty of being part of the club<br>was that the club he was talking about<br>was the five eyes and the security<br>network I understand that the the<br>problem is is that the the rules about<br>the relationship with the club are<br>secret and so if we'd gone to War as our<br>part of our commitment under the ansis<br>treaty where everything is forthright<br>and you understand the principles and<br>you know what you're fighting for I'd<br>say okay let's have the debate but when<br>you get dragged into a conflict on the<br>basis of something which you can't<br>actually see and there's really serious<br>questions about the way it behaves in a<br>very clandestine way then yes I have<br>question marks about that and I felt<br>that New Zealand's response the minimal<br>response was not because of the I don't<br>think John ke listened to my lectures<br>and said now I'm going to go left or I'm<br>going to go right I think he got a phone<br>call from his friend and said I'm going<br>club yep<br>hello<br>hello hi el thank you very much for a<br>very stimulating and and balanced uh<br>lecture um I particularly like your<br>analogy to the game where you hit down<br>the um the thingies I don't know that<br>game but I get idea um the fact is<br>actually since the so-called war on<br>terror started uh it's been a dismal<br>success we have far more terrorism now<br>than we did then uh so all of the<br>measures undertaken by the US the West<br>have failed dismally we see a a terrific<br>increase would you agree with uh uh<br>terrorism and the spread of terrorism<br>and terrorist attacks if I can come back<br>to that point um the answer is yes and<br>no that the the chance of a terrorist<br>attack is now fourfold greater post<br>September the 11th than any other point<br>the the only countries which is safer<br>ironically are the United States and so<br>what's happened is and and that's and<br>even to a degree in the Western World<br>we're relatively safe but the price of<br>that has been our civil liberties sure I<br>agree I agree but outside of that<br>whether you're looking at Nigeria or<br>Yemen or Libya these other places are<br>just breaking apart and so the war on<br>terror has created more terrorism yes<br>thank you I agree that was a preamble<br>actually um but what what I want to say<br>is that um you know on the that's the<br>Centenary of gfy and you know bearing<br>that in mind we must be even more<br>careful about committing our young<br>people I have a son of that age military<br>age to a uh you know an ill defined as<br>you say and perhaps NeverEnding war and<br>bearing in mind that um<br>uh you know the US illegally invaded<br>Iraq I would dispute your numbers about<br>the Dead the most recent study coming<br>out from the International College of<br>Physicians puts upward of a million<br>Iraqis dead due to the American Invasion<br>but I mean it doesn't matter we're<br>talking hundreds of thousands or over a<br>million the point is America<br>uh uh invaded and they created the<br>conditions in which Isis grew now I'm<br>not the person saying that Patrick COV<br>from the Independent a lot of experts<br>are saying that um so given that the US<br>is responsible in large part for a lot<br>of the Mayhem we see in the Middle East<br>given the fact that they have a long and<br>very ignoble record of intervening in<br>foreign countries uh regimes that are<br>inconvenient and even Democratic regimes<br>regimes and given that they're playing a<br>double game in<br>Syria whereby they whereby they<br>supposedly are fighting Isis but at the<br>same time the US and its<br>proxies are um funding and training the<br>war against<br>Assad that makes it much more<br>problematic to join in and um to join in<br>with that American effort because we all<br>know it's American lead so given those<br>three points isn't it incumbent on us to<br>be uh even more<br>Vigilant in joining a war with with<br>those IL defined and perhaps uh uh goals<br>and perhaps a never ending War Allah the<br>war on<br>terror this um thanks Bruce<br>um I'm I missed the Cold War you know I<br>I I'm I I'm I miss a conflict where<br>there was good guys and bad guys and I<br>knew where I stood and it was a very<br>clear Horizon of what we were meant to<br>do and today's world and today's war and<br>I imagine it's actually going to get<br>worse it's not going to get better in<br>the foreseeable future is murky and it's<br>difficult and it's very hard to make a<br>call but I think and you are correct I I<br>think the 2003 invasion was illegal<br>there's no doubt about that and I agree<br>with you I think the way that the<br>American not so much The Invasion but<br>the Reconstruction of Iraq has<br>contributed to Islamic State and the<br>rise of securian politics I think that<br>point is also<br>true<br>nonetheless even though there is<br>fingerprint of America and other<br>countries over what happened we still<br>have a problem now that needs to be<br>dealt with but just just because there<br>was complicity in the past doesn't mean<br>we shouldn't get involved now but you're<br>right but you're right we need to be<br>aware of<br>yeah more or less just following on from<br>that given the situation that we have no<br>plan for whatever happens whenever the<br>West invaded a country seeing that all<br>our military Adventures have gone bad um<br>considering that America May or quite<br>likely is playing with smokes and Ms and<br>has more than one objective in the<br>region why are we letting this whole<br>discussion be narrowed down to the<br>situation of their terrorists are we<br>intervening with military or not why<br>can't we have a wider discussion to say<br>what are the for example economic<br>implications of this conflict uh is<br>there a chance of fighting Isis and<br>these terrorists by going for the<br>economic base where we have a much<br>stronger leverage for example telling<br>turkey uh to close the border telling<br>our friends in Saudi Arabia not to<br>support them why are we here in New<br>Zealand and and in other Western<br>countries as well just focusing on<br>terrorists are we bombing on not why<br>can't we have a wider discussion about<br>the economic implications and uh working<br>through our supposed allies in the<br>region the um on on the point about<br>economics the the money that Islamic<br>state is generating at the moment comes<br>from primarily three sources it came<br>from hostages but they've largely been<br>killed off now it came from the selling<br>of Antiquities but but they what what<br>hasn't been looted has been destroyed um<br>and it came also from the taxation base<br>of the local community and it came from<br>oil as well but they seem to have<br>stopped a lot of the oil production<br>having said all that the the greater<br>problem is correctly as you pointed out<br>is that the major source of a lot of<br>Islamic State is coming through support<br>from Qatar it's coming from turkey and<br>it's coming from Saudi Arabia and and so<br>these three countries can turn on both<br>the money and the supply of soldiers<br>just like that it it really is that<br>simple and at the moment their<br>engagement against Islamic state is that<br>big officially officially and that's a<br>big concern because this this remains of<br>War by proxy by these three primarily<br>these three countries although there are<br>others against Iran and to a degree I<br>that on Syria as well with the sad yeah<br>it's huge but people people don't like<br>to think about that you know so so so we<br>think right now that Saudi Arabia is<br>just just fine and dandy by providing<br>six planes to bomb the enemy but at the<br>same time time they're largely<br>responsible many would argue because of<br>some of their religion some of their<br>particular ideologies um and also their<br>financial flows to the problem that<br>we're seeing yeah no you're right but<br>you have to see that context otherwise<br>it will just come back again and<br>again<br>yeah good evening I just wanted to um go<br>to the point you're talking about<br>refugees and that there was this huge<br>Refugee issue coming out of wars in uh<br>the Middle East<br>um you're probably where the European uh<br>Union is now calling for a widespread<br>open Border in tape of after tragedies<br>we're seeing in the Mediterranean I was<br>just wondering do you think there's any<br>validity to the claims they're saying<br>that um Isis and other terrorist<br>organizations will use this open border<br>uh policy they're allowing to almost<br>sneak um militant into these countries<br>and then homegrown terrorism or is that<br>just a claim that might be being put out<br>there to justify by not taking in<br>refugees or fighting them in the Middle<br>East um big question thank you um the<br>let's the the refugee issue is is bad<br>and getting worse it's also seasonal so<br>once the sum's over it should come down<br>a bit in in Europe but the the European<br>proposal is not have an open an open<br>border it it's to it's to collect them<br>all effectively in one net work out a<br>comprehensive quot system which is<br>increased from what they currently do<br>and then divide them up equitably<br>amongst the countries the problem is is<br>that the new Cameron government at least<br>will say no to this and so and the<br>Europeans are beginning to feel a little<br>bit overwhelmed with the amount of<br>people trying to arrive on these Shores<br>the bigger proposal of the Europeans at<br>the moment is before the security<br>Council tomorrow and that is to actually<br>allow the bombing of criminal networks<br>involved in ter um the smuggling of<br>refugees which is kind of remarkable you<br>know because I don't know how they're<br>going to do that but Libya is very<br>nervous because all of a sudden now the<br>target is not actually Islamic state it<br>could actually be a criminal groups that<br>involved in people smuggling so so<br>that's a that's a different topic but<br>the more interesting topic is what makes<br>a terrorist and are they are they<br>foreign people are they first generation<br>are they second generation a lot of work<br>has been done on what makes people<br>sympathetic to terrorism the the things<br>that we know so far is that they tend to<br>be in clusters and so where you tend to<br>find one terrorist person you will find<br>two or three sympathizers with them they<br>often tend to be isolated and a little<br>bit um withdrawn which pretty much makes<br>them any teenager that I know and that<br>they tend to be drawn to extreme views<br>about right and wrong as well um there's<br>there's no pattern in terms of ethnicity<br>over it has to do with exposure part of<br>the problem now is that the exposure is<br>over the internet and so they they can<br>get their their diet tribes from<br>anywhere they're not you know it's not<br>related to sometimes it's related to<br>particular mosque or a particular area<br>but more often than not it's not and<br>they're individual and the other thing<br>with terrorism right now is that again<br>you've got this division between<br>Al-Qaeda your gold standard you kind of<br>like your your Jason Bourne James Bond<br>type characters as opposed to Islamic<br>State which your guys are going to run<br>around with a knife or a car and and so<br>to be a terrorist today you don't need<br>to be making a bomb to blob plane you<br>just need to be very angry and go to the<br>kitchen<br>yes<br>hello okay um so first I wanted to thank<br>you or apologize for how this question<br>answer started out and thank you for<br>staying on stage and having a cohesive<br>segment um my question is has there ever<br>been a more perfect enemy or uh<br>a more fascist uh community that the UN<br>refuses to to Define as a war uh no the<br>answer is no i' I've um Wayne mentioned<br>it before I've written a three volume<br>history on a three volume history on the<br>laws of war that these guys are<br>unparalleled that you know like you<br>can't the the German you imagine the<br>fascists in World War II they they did<br>the crimes they absolutely did the<br>crimes but they tried to keep them<br>secret Islamic State does the crimes and<br>they stream them live over the Internet<br>often very similar crimes and obviously<br>the fascists at a much much industrial<br>scale but but they are without remorse<br>you know that they are unique they are<br>unique to the point that Al-Qaeda is<br>trying to tell them to calm down you<br>know you know and and so when Al-Qaeda<br>is telling you to calm down because<br>you've got a problem you know that<br>control yes good evening um one of the<br>points there's two points here already<br>one is that um while beheadings and all<br>these things are very<br>Dreadful I think we've got to be very<br>careful not to get too emotional over<br>these<br>things and use that as some sort of<br>criteria for going into a<br>war I'd like to know how many of the<br>hings have actually taken place under<br>isil I prefer to call them isil because<br>Isis yes is actually supposed to be<br>standing for the goddess of<br>love um in Saudi Arabia for example last<br>year they H between 3 and 400<br>people but we don't hear much about that<br>and they're supposed to be one of<br>America's<br>allies uh the other thing is too that<br>what makes a terrorist the<br>terrorist quite frankly I think it's<br>because of um<br>interference with their state their<br>country and when you get for example<br>America sending in all these<br>drones and<br>these what do you call it um signature<br>as Stripes where Obama just signs off an<br>agreement to strike somebody on the<br>supposition that he's a terrorist and<br>the Drone fires a missile that not only<br>kills the<br>supposed terrorist but also maybe a<br>dozen or more innocent<br>bystanders that also flouts the law<br>there's two things here one is that<br>they've gone into a sovereign state<br>which is an act of war the second point<br>is that they've thrown out the universal<br>Declaration of Human Rights one of the<br>articles there that states that every<br>person has the right to a fair trial<br>even though<br>um B Laden didn't get that<br>but I I think that um we've got to be a<br>little bit more<br>careful<br>um for example say for example if if<br>China had a um a<br>person um in downtown New York someone<br>that they didn't want um how would the<br>world respond if China was to send in a<br>um drone and with a missile and blow up<br>part of New<br>York I think um people who take pry<br>didn't View that if I may there's a lot<br>of questions to unpack there may<br>start well I'm just wondering really<br>what is the sort of the real finite um<br>criteria here that defines whether or<br>not we should become<br>involved the I'll start from the<br>beginning um I I agree we need to have<br>discussions about whether we should or<br>should not go to war on a purely<br>rational basis but we should not let<br>emotion Cloud our decisions because<br>these are the most important decisions<br>citizens can make on the point about the<br>difference between what is a terrorist<br>and I I'll run with your example for a<br>little while about what with regards to<br>drones which is a different thing the<br>difference between and I I would argue<br>that most of the drones are actually<br>there legally not illegally the<br>difference between a terrorist who kills<br>a civilian and a drone which kills a<br>civilian is one of intention and so the<br>terrorist intends to kill the civilian<br>the Drone or the soldier does not intend<br>to kill the the civilian and that very<br>fine point is the distinction between<br>the two if I can come to a third aspect<br>about the drones is that one thing we're<br>we're we're all kind of pretty freaked<br>out by drones at the moment because we<br>we're starting to see them over our own<br>neighborhoods and we're starting to see<br>them proliferate in times of War we're<br>at the CP of a military revolution in<br>terms of technology and there's just<br>been a un conference which ended two<br>weeks ago on um the new type of<br>technology which without any timee of<br>human intervention effectively Robocop<br>and and so we within two decades have<br>seen fully autonomous military systems<br>going to play at the moment when the<br>Drone flies over the top the decision of<br>whether to bomb or not bomb goes through<br>someone's brain in Texas in the future<br>that decision will not be there it will<br>computer there's no regulation for that<br>at the moment and and and if you you can<br>put it together yourself very quickly<br>you can think about C CV you can think<br>about a high powerered snipers rifle and<br>you can think about facial<br>identification and you can you can you<br>can work up very quickly the world<br>you're going<br>towards that's it okay um I've been told<br>we got to get off stage thank you very<br>much um we're going to keep cheatting<br>uh there's refreshments and um drinks<br>out out in by the bar there and will be<br>around for a short while if anyone wants<br>to um pin them up against the bar for a<br>couple more<br>questions and since we've already<br>thanked him but I would just like to say<br>thank you very much um Al and obviously<br>the question time has has been filled so<br>therefore there's a lot of lot of</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
