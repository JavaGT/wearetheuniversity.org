0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thank you very much Kevin okay so I'm<br>going to talk to you about emotions in<br>the workplace today as Kevin mentioned I<br>came to my current car profession after<br>20 years in in water resources<br>engineering I basically switched careers<br>when I came to the realization that um<br>that the engineering in the organization<br>i was working for was fine but the<br>people kept screwing it up and what the<br>hell is going on here and then we had a<br>prime minister in Australia Edward Gough<br>Whitlam who would 1974 said education is<br>free so I said right okay if I go though<br>I as well as many people of my age I<br>went back and studied part time and Here<br>I am today with with my interest in<br>organization i'm not sure if i've<br>discovered why those Dame's kept falling<br>over but I've certainly got some ideas<br>about it and I certainly know that part<br>of the equation is is the emotions to<br>mention it's all very well study the way<br>that people behave and think for many<br>many years the emotions dimension was<br>was left out now but we now know much<br>better in fact when I started with my<br>little lung emotions journey triggered<br>by a colleague passed away unfortunately<br>at University of British Columbia it was<br>it was really quite a revelation to me<br>to realize that it was dimension out<br>there that I've never even thought of<br>and these days of course it's it's<br>hugely important it's generally<br>recognized and hopefully I've contribute<br>contributed to that realization so this<br>is what I'm going to be talking about<br>tonight managing emotions in the<br>workplace which is absolutely essential<br>which I might add is still done very<br>poorly you by by many managers<br>especially in<br>in Australia so there's still a lot a<br>long way to go in that I would start off<br>with a little example of but what seems<br>to be a trivial incident but it betrays<br>a lot of the a lot of the issues going<br>on we'll talk about emotions emotional<br>intelligence everybody's heard of<br>emotion tell us how many people have<br>read Dan Goleman then going motion<br>intelligence yeq matters more than IQ<br>okay well I'll talk a little bit about<br>that I put up a cover of his book with a<br>pic of the picture of the snake oil book<br>next to each other by the way you'll see<br>that as we go through I talk a little<br>bit about tongue what emotional<br>intelligence son is managing emotions<br>and we'll finish up by talking about<br>what's involved with building the<br>emotionally healthy organization so this<br>is from my own article I wrote several<br>years ago with I was Kathy douse it<br>appeared in the Academy of management<br>executive but it starts off with talking<br>about a fairly minor situation this is<br>the story of Ruth Ellison she's just<br>gotten out on the wrong side of the bed<br>nothing's going wrong it it get gets<br>even worse when she gets to work the<br>boss seems to be all over her and that<br>the day just get sighs it gets worse and<br>worse she's trying to work as a as a<br>sales clerk and struggling to to be<br>friendly to the to the customers at the<br>end of the day she just has had it she<br>James of class register which people<br>then have difficulty undoing and<br>basically sets up a bad mood for the for<br>the whole week following it well Ruth<br>really struggled to deal with her<br>colleagues also struggled to to deal<br>with her they're all getting into a bad<br>mood this is the process of of emotional<br>contagion where one person catches the<br>emotion from another person in the<br>workplace so everybody here has had a<br>day like that right and things just<br>don't seem to go right and you get worn<br>down or a colleague is getting worn down<br>and<br>thought it goes around the office and<br>after while you've got a sort of vicious<br>circle feeds in with the bosses really<br>upset with the way that people are<br>working and then the people get told up<br>by the boss and get into a worse mood<br>and then so on it goes and we've all<br>experienced some these sorts of<br>situations throughout the day and<br>transfer it across some the whole work<br>fast footwork force across millions of<br>workers this issue of managing emotions<br>is critical to the to the productivity<br>not just the productivity but the<br>well-being of the of the workforce so<br>we're going to look at some at how<br>emotional intelligence fits into this<br>picture some of the sort of the facts<br>and fiction about emotion intelligence<br>and is it possible to do anything about<br>this can we actually improve it for me<br>it started with with this a rather<br>complicated looking little little<br>diagram organizational behavior people<br>love drawing little pictures are like<br>this basically it says stuff happens<br>here it is up here okay in the workplace<br>and it generates hassles and uplifts and<br>prior to the what we call the effective<br>revolution the most of the theories were<br>that people react to the environment and<br>it's sort of in a cognitive while prior<br>to that even a behavioral way people<br>react to the environment and that<br>because of the environment and based on<br>their own personal dispositions might be<br>their personality etc they then form<br>attitudes and then they behave in<br>certain ways so this particular run<br>theory which was introduced by two<br>scholars by the name of Harold Weiss and<br>Russell crop Manzano another 20 years<br>ago now really was the first one that<br>put this front and center experienced<br>emotions positive emotions coming from<br>our up lips that we experience at work<br>negative emotions coming from our<br>negative experiences at work so there's<br>not a direct connection between what<br>happens in the workplace and<br>and what we experience in the workplace<br>and attitudes of behavior and an<br>empirical evidence over the last 20<br>years has established through numerous<br>studies that this is the way that it<br>works you experience these emotions<br>you've experienced this lump in the aura<br>and your stomach or this uplifting<br>feeling whatever it is and coming out of<br>that inform particular attitudes you<br>might act impulsively based on something<br>that happens in the workplace are not<br>necessarily young a negative it may not<br>be just punching the boss in the nose it<br>might be helping somebody out doing<br>something impulsively positive so you<br>can get what what was in crops on a call<br>ever given behaviors but also it these<br>are over a period of times these<br>accumulate to generate the the attitudes<br>that we form at work and the most<br>well-known attitudes of course a job<br>satisfaction loyalty and commitment and<br>based on those attitudes then down the<br>track we behave in certain ways we<br>decide that we're going to work hard or<br>not work hard with we're going to stay<br>in the organization or leave the<br>organization okay doesn't seem like much<br>but the critical point here is that<br>right in the middle we've got this this<br>emotions and as I said study after study<br>has established that so so what's going<br>on here well it all starts here with<br>your rug with your limbic system which<br>is most of the stuff between you between<br>your ears so we've got our cortical<br>brain which is that curly bit on the<br>outside of the brain and inside the<br>cortical brain we've got all of these<br>basic parts sometimes called the lizard<br>brain this is the the brain that we<br>share with it with the lowest order of<br>the of the animal kingdom and their<br>basic essential for survival so let's<br>take a look at one particular part of<br>the of the of the lizard brain this is<br>the amygdala so how's your Latin who<br>nobody kissing what it is like<br>yeah Armin this is I mean to her already<br>talking about these okay the amygdala<br>means Armand it's a it's a ganglia a<br>connection of our new rounds located<br>about an inch or 25 millimetres in from<br>your temples on either side of your<br>brain nobody quite knew what what his<br>purpose was until a neuro scientist by<br>the name of Joe LeDoux from in white<br>university came along and Joe was one of<br>these animals experimental people who<br>did horrible things to rats he actually<br>removed the cortical brain from rats who<br>I know don't do that sort of the lizard<br>anyway so he had brainless Rhett<br>brainless right okay so and then he put<br>the brainless rats in an environment and<br>then I exposed them to a loud noise ok<br>now what a rats do when they hear a loud<br>noise right to a mice hmm another day<br>before they run that hear something else<br>today freeze somebody's really the books<br>they freeze little whiskers go around<br>the place so they freeze and what tired<br>Joe found was that the brainless rats<br>did the same thing nephritis how could<br>this be no brain well without<br>registering this information in the<br>first place in a series a brilliant<br>studies you can read about it in his<br>book published in about nineteen<br>nineteen ninety-four he tracks the the<br>passenger of the stimulus the noise<br>through the brain sensory stimulus comes<br>in through the sensory thelma switch is<br>of basically a switching Center in your<br>brain and then the the information then<br>goes up into the cortex oh this is your<br>cortex up here this is the party of<br>brain that tongue that solves problem<br>and and over here it also goes to the<br>Middler okay now the difference with me<br>the amygdala and the cortical brain is<br>let me tell you in a bit story and<br>you'll get your get an idea when you<br>travel overseas from from and New<br>Zealand especially when you go to Europe<br>or the<br>united states in those countries they<br>don't know what side of the road to<br>drive i don't know whether you've<br>noticed that they go on the wrong side<br>it you don't believe me it's the wrong<br>side of the road it is the wrong side of<br>the road the Germans sir they're not the<br>Germans the Romans the Romans came to<br>conclusions you have to go on the left<br>hand side of the road so you can strike<br>down your enemies with you sort right<br>okay you got left hand side of the road<br>your sword hands your right hand didn't<br>know left-handers in those days okay and<br>you can deal with people okay and that's<br>what was it just accepted that everybody<br>went on the left hand side of the road<br>come the French Revolution of course who<br>ride their carriages on the left hand<br>side of the road the aristocracy the<br>people started the road called the<br>French Revolution is the right hand side<br>of the road the people's have had a<br>revolution we will change to the right<br>hand side of the road that's her copy<br>French Revolution the appalling and<br>spreaded across Europe and cause some it<br>ended up getting transferred to to the<br>to the USA where a general Lafayette it<br>was the french general is helping out<br>tongue washington says well now you have<br>had your revolution you must follow the<br>French you must drive on the right hand<br>side of the hall good ideas says George<br>Washington and there we have it anyone<br>so with that bit a bit of background you<br>now know that these people overseas they<br>drive on the wrong side of the road now<br>when I go to these countries I have no<br>problem with hopping in a car and<br>driving on the right side of the road<br>somebody told me the rule is don't think<br>left to right just kick the middle of<br>the road on the driver's side you can't<br>go wrong okay so off we go and that's<br>not a problem at all but there's a<br>problem crossing the road I always have<br>problem crossing that damn road okay the<br>summer is really walking along a<br>destructive you need to cross the road<br>and you go to step off the go to step<br>off the curb and sunny whoosh the bus<br>goes by that was close ah boy oh boy<br>that bus nearly got me now what I didn't<br>do was I didn't so here comes a bus it's<br>traveling the unexpected direction it's<br>about to about to hit me and<br>they kill me I better step back if I do<br>that what happens bang strawberry jam<br>okay so that's not going to work very<br>well well luckily the amygdala is there<br>to catch it the amygdala operates in<br>about 300 milliseconds so in 300<br>milliseconds the information going<br>through my eyes the bus is coming cutter<br>peripheral vision that the cutters<br>information immediately a behavioral<br>response of course accompanied by by<br>hormones the adrenaline pumps up and you<br>brought you feel or flushed after you've<br>done something after you've done<br>something like that okay so it's a basic<br>survival mechanism this thing operates<br>in 300 milliseconds the cortical brain<br>about twelve hundred milliseconds okay<br>so twelve hundred milliseconds Nellie a<br>second later you know you did split on<br>the road by the time you come to that<br>conclusion basic part of survival it<br>also has another effect there megan has<br>a few of XX you it has a direct<br>connection to your to your memory<br>systems ok it is direct connection to<br>your memory systems think back to 911 ok<br>back to 911 11th of September 2001 what<br>were you doing you know exactly what<br>you're doing right you remember looking<br>at that TV set and going oh my God look<br>at that and you remember who was there<br>and what you were doing and everything<br>megala the amygdalas done that because<br>it's a stressful situation the amygdala<br>put up the the the alarm signs says<br>store that information in your in your<br>memory it's a basic survival mechanism<br>ok so the Middler is there these little<br>parts of your brain the Jolla do<br>discovered are just so critical and of<br>course it's the reason why when you go<br>into that other job interview or when<br>you're speaking in front of a crowd like<br>this no matter how cool you're trying to<br>keep you can feel that nervous knot in<br>your stomach beads of perspiration etc<br>right ok the reason is that the amygdala<br>is detecting this is threatening<br>information and is feeding it into your<br>autonomic nervous system your hormones<br>are running and your behavioral response<br>oh my god I want to be out of here okay<br>so that's really important we now know<br>in particular the process of controlling<br>that amygdala and your feelings are<br>resulting from it constitute hard work<br>in fact psychologists have demonstrated<br>that after they regulated their emotions<br>in and actually the study is simply<br>showing people pictures of gory<br>operations what's this video of a gory<br>operation and keep a smile on your face<br>the whole time okay and the people who<br>watch the operation are then tested for<br>their strength the ones have been able<br>to keep a smile and they face the whole<br>time are much weaker than the ones who<br>didn't have to smile so it actually<br>consumes physical resources and<br>everybody here knows how exhaust that<br>you are when you come out of an<br>interview or any stressful situation<br>that's why so I've just well done this<br>because it's just lies at the very heart<br>of understanding everything to do with<br>the importance of emotions in everyday<br>life as well as are in the in the<br>workplace so well let's let's move on<br>now to I have a bit of a closer look as<br>the idea of emotional intelligence I was<br>first proposed done in a serious<br>scientific sense by young by two<br>psychologists out of North America Jack<br>Maya and Peter Sullivan Peter salary by<br>the way as the as the president of Yale<br>University now so they're very very<br>prominent scholars a reporter from The<br>Times newspaper heard about the stuff<br>that tongue these guys were applying<br>this new method in the education of<br>primary school kids and his name was on<br>Dan Goleman he was acting on a PhD in<br>organizational psychology apush should<br>point out 10 common but anyway he was<br>working as a as a reporter for The New<br>York Times he goes out there and he<br>finds out about emotional intelligence<br>and he thinks it's a wonderful thing and<br>began being<br>good with the pen he writes this<br>fantastic book emotional intelligence y<br>eq matters more than the nike oh i guess<br>his uh gets his his his book on the<br>cover of Time magazine and emotional<br>intelligence has taken off one of the<br>things that are the den Goldman said<br>once he found emotional intelligence was<br>goes like this research has established<br>that twenty percent of your success in<br>life is determined by your cognitive<br>intelligence therefore eps efecto the<br>other eighty percent must be accounted<br>for by your emotional intelligence right<br>and as a scientist working in the area<br>we have to deal with that particular<br>little number over and over again in<br>fact I remember it I at a PSYOP<br>conference society of industrial<br>organization with psychologist one of<br>the biggest names in the field was as<br>they often do getting stuck into the<br>field of emotional intelligence were we<br>were trying to present our research and<br>one of the people in their presentation<br>had demonstrated quite a strong<br>relationship between emotional<br>intelligence and work performance and<br>this guy is a discussant very well-known<br>scholar his name's Kevin Murphy by the<br>way organizational psychology will<br>certainly recognized that name he gets<br>up there and he says look um yeah that<br>might be an impressive result but Dan<br>Goleman said it was eighty percent ah no<br>please please anyway the problem is that<br>it was just exaggerated it's turned into<br>a fad no doubt at all emotional<br>intelligence is a these days the newest<br>fad is as new row leadership and you<br>rode this and you wrote that it's doing<br>the same sort of thing people just going<br>over the over the top its food for<br>skeptics a lot of my colleagues are<br>especially reveal which it seems when i<br>send my articles off about emotional<br>intelligence there's a good change<br>you're going to get a reviewer who says<br>no it's emotional intelligence it's all<br>bs and i just rejected don't worry it's<br>not going to happen and we're literally<br>used to it fact we often write letters<br>to the editor saying please please don't<br>send it to one of these people who just<br>to reject it out of hand because there<br>is good scientific evidence so here's a<br>little illustration of some of the some<br>of the attitudes to emotional<br>intelligence we're looking for managers<br>that demonstrate higher levels of<br>emotional intelligence here please try<br>on this mood ring okay so a little bit<br>going going that way so let's look at<br>what emotional intelligence is it's this<br>link from but it's it's it and it's<br>positively related to emotional and tell<br>them to other intelligence to<br>intellectual intelligence but it's but<br>it certainly is distinct um we know from<br>particularly from the from the neuro<br>scientific neurobiological evidence<br>that's coming out that um people who<br>have no emotional intelligence because<br>I've suffered some sort of trauma to the<br>brain can be highly intelligent but have<br>no appreciation of emotions whatsoever<br>in consequently aren't able to think<br>straight and yet and you find people<br>like that it's like the doctors box of<br>this world you don't find them in<br>spaceships directing young the spaceship<br>to a successful trip to another galaxy<br>you find them in institutions because<br>these are people who are able to unable<br>to think because they don't have access<br>to any of the the emotions that we need<br>to to make judgmental decisions cells<br>the thing from positively related to<br>other intelligences okay like any aspect<br>of human beings are some people are good<br>at it some people are not so good at it<br>my wife is somebody who's good at it I'm<br>somebody who's not good at and she<br>reminds me of that very frequently ok so<br>it's an individual difference where some<br>people are better than others it<br>develops over a person's life span I<br>know that some of you are thinking oh<br>wait telligence is not supposed to<br>develop over your life span is an<br>intelligence fixed by the time you reach<br>reach our maturity I telligent ain't<br>fixed when you reach maturity you test<br>our intelligence before people going to<br>university and after they come out of<br>universe<br>to the end they've got higher<br>intelligence when they come out said it<br>because a large part of intelligence is<br>that tongue what they call the<br>crystallized intelligence that develops<br>over a lifespan and makes you more<br>intelligence the fluid stuff are<br>probably is fixed okay okay so it<br>involves at least in part your ability<br>to identify and perceive emotion in<br>yourself as well as in other people the<br>ability to use that information to<br>understand it and to use it to manage<br>emotions both in yourself as well as in<br>other people so that's what emotion<br>intelligences it's not personality and a<br>lot of the people who sell various<br>versions of emotional intelligence I'll<br>get to them in a second really what<br>they're selling is personality measures<br>dressed up in different ways it's not a<br>set of general into personal<br>competencies it really does relate to<br>Tina emotions then Goldman in particular<br>is guilty of the next one he defines are<br>in part on emotional intelligence as<br>being the ability to lead and then then<br>he publishes work showing that time<br>motion intelligence akoya his definition<br>is associated with leadership well yeah<br>if somebody if you define something is<br>ability to lead and they're going to be<br>better at leadership circular argument<br>okay it's not intellectual intelligence<br>despite what some of my colleagues John<br>Antonakos who Kevin knows very well he<br>says it's all gene G is just the word<br>for general intelligence picks up all of<br>these all of these sorts of things we<br>know from that tongue from the from the<br>neuropsychology psychological evidence<br>that it's quite distinct from g it's not<br>just social intelligence I hate think<br>people say that emotional intelligence<br>is an outcrop of social intelligence<br>just some people are better at dealing<br>with social situations it's not just<br>that its associated with each one of<br>these things but it is quite quite<br>different ok this is the work that I did<br>again with Catherine Dallas I one who<br>did<br>that original article and we identify<br>what we call three streams of emotional<br>intelligence so um the first stream is<br>is this one you're not tell me something<br>more about that in a second it's<br>pronounced musky the second stream is<br>sticking to the original mayor and<br>celibate definition with self-report<br>piripi report observational tests not<br>quite good as not quite as good as doing<br>a real emotional intelligence test like<br>an IQ test but it's one way of measuring<br>it and it can be more efficient<br>especially in group situations streams<br>free are other definitions based on<br>self-report and Peele report so let me<br>talk a little bit about each one of<br>these things and you should get an idea<br>ok so the mesquite is a new word in the<br>in the English language mayor salivate<br>caruso emotional intelligence test male<br>celebi Caruso emotional intelligence<br>says so Jack buyer and Peter celebrate<br>their the academics and David Caruso is<br>the is the consultant and if you want to<br>find out about emotional intelligence<br>and the mesquite to google that but make<br>sure that you go to the David Caruso<br>site because that's where all of the<br>resources are located so the mesquite is<br>a is a I cute style test that has right<br>and wrong answers one of the images in<br>the in the mesquite for instance is a<br>picture of rocks and underneath the<br>rocks it's got a multiple choice<br>question so just I'm not going to put it<br>up there picture of rocks you can<br>imagine rocks ok so what rooks that<br>rocks what do rocks remind you of in<br>terms of in terms of emotions anger joy<br>fear or nothing what do you think anger<br>joy fear or nothing joy rocks joy ok<br>fear 3 what rocks might fall on your<br>head just a pile of rocks I guess if<br>they're in palmera they've been do they<br>they are pretty pretty scary stuff but<br>no rocks pile of rocks not nothing no<br>emotional associate but that's the right<br>answer with that one those of you who<br>are saying joy and fear probably<br>marks on your emotional intelligence<br>this in in that one but it's a whole<br>series of torial illustrations a<br>presentation of difference in areas 145<br>questions and all online commercial test<br>you got to pay for it unfortunately I<br>give a discount for researcher<br>unfortunately but um but anyway it's an<br>IQ time style test it covers these four<br>dimensions that I mentioned that before<br>so on here we've got perceiving emotions<br>and which is where it starts and then<br>using those perceived emotions to<br>facilitate thought and then once you've<br>done that then you can go around and<br>understand what emotions is all about<br>and then manage your own emotions and<br>the motions of others here is a lady<br>she's actually sitting at a board<br>meeting student of mine made this video<br>this is a stop action from the video<br>this lady's emotions reflect it on her<br>face here's what a neutral face<br>obviously has been coded by something<br>called the facial action coding system<br>developed by a by a scholar and very<br>rich consultant days name is Paul Paul<br>Ekman so she's got a particular<br>emotional expression on her face so<br>we'll do this little exercise that we<br>had we had before okay so these are the<br>emotions that she could have according<br>to ekman he's got the six basic emotions<br>so joy yeah probably not doing doesn't<br>look too much like Jordan fear how many<br>people think there's a fearful<br>expression fear few people think these<br>fearful okay what about discussed people<br>anybody go for discuss anger sadness<br>what about sadness sadness any takers<br>for sadness surprise shaking your head<br>surprise few people got the hand I hold<br>it how many people to put your hand up<br>if you got surprise give yourself an<br>award you're right the facial action<br>coding system basically goes on on<br>measuring various bits and pieces of the<br>face in relation to other bits and<br>pieces the clue here is the eyebrows<br>certainly not going to get sadness or<br>anger or<br>or that of course with disgust you've<br>got to get the wrinkled nose okay you're<br>going to get that Fiat the mouth doesn't<br>what you don't you know fearful when<br>your mouth like that quick when you fear<br>from it's okay the eyes the eyes open up<br>a lot more than that okay so the mouth<br>tells you about that okay now when I<br>present this particular picture at<br>meetings of the international society of<br>research in emotions or other university<br>departments that are Chloe about<br>emotions which everybody puts up the<br>hand and says that it's a surprise lay<br>audiences I get a few people who pick<br>surprised by and large people don't<br>touch don't take surprise so on now we<br>know that most of you are not very<br>emotionally intelligent with you can we<br>can move on but it's true most people I<br>mean motion challenges like an IQ so it<br>has the the middle value is around about<br>100 and people will go up and down<br>around that liberal okay I want to talk<br>in particular about the bear walk dassen<br>and and I carrot characterized as the<br>stream three models because you come<br>across them all the time they're they're<br>quite strongly salt sold in the by the<br>consultants around town so anybody come<br>across this number Gina's do you know<br>this comes out of Melbourne jeaneth no<br>okay EQI come on you've come across EQI<br>ravine bar on a couple of people to come<br>across it okay Levin barons an<br>interesting guy he's Israeli originally<br>did his PhD roads university in in South<br>Africa and he he studied Alexei Tommy<br>alexithymia alexithymia in case you<br>don't know is a clinical condition where<br>people are unable to recognize him most<br>somebody's got alexithymia if an angry<br>person confronts them they'll just stay<br>in there and go what do you want they<br>don't recognize his emotions at all so<br>he studies this part of the part of the<br>his studies he comes up with a scale<br>testing the people with alexithymia<br>he reads then Goldman's book and Robin<br>bar owners in israel israeli okay this<br>is the number one country in the world<br>for entrepreneurship he thinks as how i<br>can make money and he goes off to<br>interesting the same company that<br>publishes the mesquite multi health<br>systems in in Toronto and Canon he goes<br>off there and he says I've got this<br>great test look at all these wonderful<br>properties of it and he starts selling<br>and in fact are the other people at MHS<br>tell me that the young that the EQI is<br>easily the largest selling young<br>emotional intelligence package in the<br>world self-report and almost completely<br>accountable by it its correlations with<br>personality so it's a measure of<br>personality not emotional intelligence<br>despite what they say okay dan Goldman's<br>got his own test called oh the emotional<br>competencies are scale it's not bad as<br>it consulting to but it's not a motion<br>intelligence as I said it includes<br>leadership and that sort of thing<br>basically all of these tests which is so<br>popular just like this little number<br>here that was also very popular about<br>100 250 years ago so smoked or cured<br>everything emotion intelligent skewers<br>everything does it okay but certainly if<br>you want to do emotional intelligence<br>some you need to look at that mesquite<br>and the mayor and celery wood okay<br>clearly emotion telligence is associated<br>with leadership and I've just been<br>saying the dang Goldman has got a has<br>got a circular relationship but even<br>without the circular relationship the<br>idea that I that transformational and<br>charismatic leaders influence people<br>emotions and it follows from that if<br>their leaders got higher emotional<br>intelligence you do all those things I<br>mentioned before they're going to be<br>able to influence people even more<br>strongly so that are holds the reason<br>that that's going to be the case you've<br>all had done you've all had I'm sure<br>managers who can't read emotions and<br>they tend to be rather ineffective and<br>for watch out for this number are the<br>curse of emotions what about a leader<br>who focuses almost exclusively on a<br>motion<br>and this is this is one of the one of<br>the traps that you get in we're thinking<br>that emotions are the bill on the end or<br>they're not the emotions are part of the<br>equation then go and modisett eighty<br>percent but it's actually motion<br>intelligence accounts for about another<br>twenty percent we think these days of<br>your success in your career in your life<br>twenty percent intellectual intelligence<br>twenty percent for emotional<br>intelligence was a big hug but the other<br>sixty percent is all the other things<br>that happen in your life powerful other<br>people who might help you luck and all<br>of the things that you can you can lead<br>to a successful love you're probably<br>thinking at this stage yeah but what<br>about those leaders who who manipulate<br>people for their own and the farias<br>purpose is exactly right it's called<br>strategic emotional intelligence people<br>who actually use their emotional<br>intelligence to to influence people<br>sometimes not in a very positive way<br>bernard baths are called that um pseudo<br>transformational leadership people who<br>seem to be transforming transforming<br>people's lives for the better but in the<br>end ultimately lead them in a in a very<br>negative direction you could think of<br>characters if you're only going to see<br>those images of Hitler at the Nuremberg<br>rallies and the way that he just simply<br>totally took hold of people's emotions<br>so that's an example of that okay this<br>has got a bit of emotion intelligence<br>anyway there we go my student Peter<br>Jordan did an interesting study where he<br>looked at UM emotional intelligence in<br>teens he measured emotion intelligence<br>in this one using a mayor and celery<br>method but with Sir with self self<br>report and what we were interested in in<br>this study was how well did they added<br>emotional intelligence predict the main<br>outcomes for the course which we<br>actually measured by getting the<br>students to work in groups and keep<br>Diaries of their group by interaction so<br>it actually was in the group's haider<br>turning a logbook every week so we could<br>actually then code that and see the<br>extent of which are the two critical<br>criteria for the cause<br>were gold setting the groups were<br>supposed to be setting goals and testing<br>them all the time and interpersonal<br>reactions these are the results that he<br>got and it's quite a fascinating an<br>important one from an organizational<br>point of view let's focus on this one<br>here that's got the most clear-cut<br>results both groups actually say show<br>the same things but this one is the most<br>clear-cut results that we've got<br>basically the high emotional<br>intelligence our groups group emotional<br>intelligence for this study was just<br>averaging the members of the group so<br>the high emotional intelligence groups<br>basically could do it from the start<br>even though there was a little bit of an<br>improvement towards the end they could<br>do it from week one the low emotional<br>intelligence groups on the other hand<br>were hopeless at the start we do they<br>didn't have much of a clue at all about<br>goal setting okay but by the end of the<br>groups are exactly the same okay this<br>has quite an important implication from<br>a from a managerial point of view means<br>if you do the testing and find out whose<br>emotion so is its don't waste money<br>trying to train them there's no point in<br>trying to teach them emotionally<br>intelligent grandmas to suck eggs<br>basically they already know how to do it<br>so that's an interesting little lesson<br>there that there is something there is<br>something called group emotional<br>intelligence and if as an employer you<br>can measure it at the start you can save<br>money on the train this is my my student<br>Jimmy king whose are currently working<br>on this on this project gemma is<br>measuring stress using cortisol so in<br>the studies that you go where we have<br>ethical clearance for these studies but<br>we scare the pants off of our students<br>basically in these sessions stress them<br>out with threats of being ostracized or<br>abusive supervision we measure their<br>stress by getting them to spit into<br>little dials full of thumb little files<br>are spit their saliva into these little<br>files take it away and we measure for<br>rum for cortisol which is a hormone<br>secreted when you're when you're feeling<br>your stress and before that we get them<br>to complete the the mesquite<br>and get me to the mesquite and the<br>correlation between the cortisol reading<br>and their measure on the mesquite is<br>actually point for it's actually<br>negative point for to a little dash in<br>for another negative point for the more<br>emotional intelligence they are the more<br>they can read the signs in themselves<br>manage their emotions in themselves okay<br>and consequently they tend to be less<br>stressed the ones who have the lower<br>emotional intelligence are the ones who<br>get tongue you get a pretty stressed and<br>we successfully debrief we have had a<br>single complaint from these studies they<br>don't pay then panic but gemma is just a<br>writing up these are these studies at<br>the moment and we hopefully it'll be<br>published fairly soon okay well this<br>takes us to the other important done<br>managerial implication which is the work<br>of emotion management known in general<br>as as emotional labor this lady here<br>arlie hochschild studied our flight<br>attendants and and she wrote this book<br>called the managed heart and basically<br>these are people flight attendants in<br>particular who do that emotion and walk<br>that's so exhausting and it's what<br>where's up flight attendants and anybody<br>working in the service industries who<br>are who are doing it it affects their<br>performance it affects their health and<br>anybody work in the customer area we<br>have to smile all the time by the way it<br>also affects people who have to growl<br>all the time as well so if you're<br>working in the debt collection area or<br>the policing area or even funeral<br>funeral parlor operators standing there<br>watching people do crazy things during<br>funerals and I can't smile right okay so<br>anywhere we've got to regulate the<br>emotions it's hard work and it take an<br>where you wear you out it depends upon<br>the type of motion labor that you do by<br>the way if you try to fake your emotions<br>the effects are much worse than if you<br>use method acting which is called done<br>which is called dumb deep acting so if<br>you use deep acting instead of trying to<br>just keep a focus special on your face<br>you go into work thinking of the last<br>time you had a celebration<br>you can sort of keep your face smiling<br>and it turns out it's less worrying when<br>you do that so it depends upon the type<br>of emotional labor of course the best<br>thing is to really enjoy your job and<br>have a smile because you just haven't<br>fun that doesn't happen all the time if<br>you had a rough day maybe you need to<br>think and what's what's kind reappraised<br>a situation you maybe need to think<br>about a happy time some of the things<br>you can do as a as a manager basically<br>be on the lookout for people who are who<br>are struggling it have been effectively<br>and preventatively we'll talk about that<br>in a few minutes time become aware of<br>that that you do need to diagnose people<br>not just on their cognitive abilities<br>but on their on their emotional<br>abilities with my colleague Ron Humphrey<br>we've been writing about leading with<br>emotional labor and so leaders<br>themselves can actually use their<br>emotional labor and this is associated<br>with their emotional intelligence as<br>well to contain your motions and to<br>practice that but again done poorly it<br>becomes very exhausting so you can leave<br>with emotion labor but it can become<br>emotionally exhausting okay I'm going to<br>finish off it just talking about what<br>we've got to do to develop the the<br>emotionally healthy organization<br>basically as in any health situation<br>there's two approaches of prevention and<br>restoration so just as it might be with<br>your with your health you want to<br>prevent the medical things happening to<br>you but you also want to I want to<br>restore if things are do go do go bad<br>keys of a positive and friendly<br>emotional climate in the organization so<br>this is just spread the the feeling<br>right across the organization that this<br>is a positive place we all know the<br>experience of going into an organization<br>where everybody's just grumpy all the<br>time and you can't help but feel<br>stressed in that's a situation set up<br>rewards and composite and compensation<br>systems that are directly related to the<br>extent to which people modeled is so<br>there's positive and friendly<br>fear and finally actually purposely<br>select employees are going to do better<br>so the emotional intelligence tests for<br>instance a widely used in um in<br>selection now it may be because peter<br>Celebi is the is the president of a VI<br>university but if you want to get any<br>yale university or do an emotional<br>intelligence test these days so there's<br>an example of a world-renowned<br>educational institution coming to<br>conclusion that that's how important<br>emotion sciences okay some of the things<br>that you can do just simply work out<br>what's positive and negative about the<br>jobs that people doing think back to<br>that effective events theory we had at<br>the start what are the hassles what are<br>the uploads diagnose the the hassles and<br>the up lips identify the challenges and<br>do things that are going to go to buffer<br>those challenges and give people some<br>sort of protection from them model a<br>healthy emotional expression yourself<br>bosses who go around the place some<br>making everybody feel miserable lander<br>and being grumpy etc don't help much but<br>at the same time don't try to fake it so<br>we know that that surface level<br>emotional labor makes your worn-out<br>doesn't work very well you need to you<br>need to you need to be be genuine in<br>that regard actually one of the one of<br>the key findings from the effect of<br>events theory research is that it's the<br>accumulation of positive or negative<br>that has the strongest effects it's not<br>so much the intensity people couldn't<br>come withstand a couple of setbacks but<br>if it's day in day out hustle hustle<br>hustle hustle that's it where's your out<br>and again on the positive side having<br>one or two celebrations doesn't help<br>forum that but if you're in a workplace<br>where there's constant up lips going on<br>that's going to lead to these positive<br>outcomes i'm talking about in this in<br>this tool specifically reward and<br>encourage desired behavior in terms of<br>their emotional effects very little done<br>in the in in australia<br>that's becoming very strong movement in<br>the United States to set up these these<br>positive work environment including<br>direct expectations that people are<br>going to behave like this so if somebody<br>is constantly grumpy and upsetting<br>people love in a workplace see that as<br>an aspect of their work performance it's<br>going to affect the work performance of<br>everybody around them select for<br>positive emotional attitude I've been<br>there before actually do an emotional<br>intelligence test in the interview<br>situation looking for people who are<br>more positive rather than the people who<br>seem to be serious but but tend to be<br>rather rather negative so collect<br>whatever data you can to tell you who<br>are going to be the more positive people<br>actually trained for emotional<br>intelligence David Caruso is the Guru on<br>that and he shows he has a series of<br>programs that trains for each of those<br>for what they call branches the<br>perception of emotion facilitating<br>thought understanding emotion and<br>managing emotions and getting people to<br>understand that if they want to to<br>present emotional states they need to do<br>this this deep acting which is just like<br>the method acting that that actors do<br>and through these methods stop people<br>from burning out emotionally which often<br>happens through through emotional labor<br>not done not done will change the<br>organization's culture if you've got an<br>organization that I just has a long term<br>culture sometimes you need to run you<br>need to rally the troops you need to try<br>to change the culture by bringing in<br>explicit rewards that's going to<br>encourage people to move from one state<br>to another it's hard to change your<br>change culture but if you don't change<br>it if you don't begin to try to change<br>it it'll never change and can leave you<br>and to lead you into difficulties<br>actually redesigned jobs as the<br>ritz-carlton hotel says do whatever is<br>necessary to meet their requirements of<br>customers and actually make part of the<br>criteria for job design situations that<br>that lead to to trust and positive<br>thought in organizations deal with<br>problem employees maybe even our site of<br>problem employees well this is not the<br>place where you should be working it's<br>it's sort of what is it called um being<br>nice by being cruel or whatever it is<br>anyway the idea is that sometimes for<br>the good of the organization as a whole<br>you need to take some some tough<br>decisions to do that okay okay so that's<br>that's the content this is the plug now<br>for the for the email net group if<br>anybody is interested in participating<br>in Alistair which has about 1600 members<br>worldwide including most academic but<br>certainly including a quite a lot of of<br>practitioners maybe two or three hundred<br>worldwide all you have to do is just go<br>to this website or just google email net<br>or just google me and whatever we do run<br>this listserv we've had it going now<br>since I'm 1997 we run by annual<br>conferences so you can see the list of<br>conferences are there we've just done<br>just a year ago finished our conference<br>in there in Philadelphia and we're just<br>planning at the moment for our next star<br>conference which is going to be in Rome<br>all the details you'll find on that time<br>the website if you are interested in<br>pursuing it and as Kevin said I edit a<br>book series the book series is tied into<br>the conference basically the chapters in<br>the books are about a half based on the<br>papers coming out of the conference and<br>a half based on invited contribution but<br>we're just giving up at the moment for a<br>volume 12 I'm just corresponding early<br>today quite vigorously with authors etc<br>are getting ready for volume 12 which<br>will be set off to the to the printers<br>are early next year and
