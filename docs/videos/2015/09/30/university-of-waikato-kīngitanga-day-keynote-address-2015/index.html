Monte<br>suitor who is our foremost Marty<br>military historian and who has a passion<br>for our military history following on<br>from her successful book now Tama Toa<br>the price of citizenship about the Maori<br>battalion c company he is currently<br>working on a major publication about the<br>mighty contributions to the field First<br>World War so when I contacted him to see<br>if he would be our keynote speaker the<br>timing seemed to be just right because<br>he was doing his research about this<br>area and World War one he is a trained<br>teacher served in the in NZ SAS holds a<br>number of appointments on national<br>boards and was honored and this year's<br>New Year's Honours List I know that you<br>know Monty has a reputation in the Eyrie<br>of naughty pro but like me he is from<br>natty yawa and naughty put oh and that<br>means we're doubly blessed<br>and we have fights with ourselves but I<br>don't wish to take up any more time I do<br>want to acknowledge that in the<br>playhouse theatre is another audience<br>and we don't we can't sort of holograph<br>montien that they will be watching him<br>live on screen so I just want to<br>acknowledge those of you next door and I<br>know in that group are a number of<br>students from school so tena koe so far<br>no I know you will enjoy Monty's talk<br>today<br>to target of karma yogi tea cocoa butter<br>are right King kavya Ricky Martin Martin<br>walking away to tahiti neurological<br>tokoto dinner hockey coach tell everyone<br>on La Rocca know him outta cotton we<br>park here call home by negligent in a4a<br>eatin ADA tennapel tell Tina Porter<br>dinner<br>first of all I'd like to begin by saying<br>it's absolute honor and privilege to be<br>here to speak in support of what what we<br>are celebrating relationship between the<br>University and the King come on I I<br>didn't come lightly I respect the the<br>what is trying to be achieved here and<br>as I say I'm honored to be asked to<br>speak today I must say of course when I<br>was first invited I had to think about<br>it because on our neck of the woods we<br>have some sayings some people in here<br>will know them well they had a taco<br>mullah he could I need the money connect<br>a monitor thana moutoku king e Tama not<br>a poem murano and another hotel na kiya<br>toh kukini way up a dragon and I went<br>translate this because those people who<br>need to know know what I'm talking about<br>but it as as professor Smith said it<br>came the invitation came after three to<br>four months of solid research on trying<br>to understand the King eating a wake<br>atoll position during World War one and<br>you may know it over here but the rest<br>of the country do not know and once I've<br>done that research you cannot help but<br>sympathize and admire why cotton for the<br>stance they talk in 1914 and the<br>principle that they stood by right<br>through to the end of World War one and<br>in doing that research I couldn't start<br>at 1914 I had to look back 50 years<br>earlier to appreciate why they held that<br>view and I learned who can toffee I was<br>his prophecies and what his people<br>suffered during that period and it was<br>that which I was thinking about when I<br>said yes I would come so timing is<br>important probably any other year before<br>this I probably would have said no but I<br>have a new appreciation for what for the<br>struggle that continues even today I do<br>really know who I was talking to today<br>and so I didn't make any notes I thought<br>I wait to see what the audience was and<br>this is a very diverse range and I I<br>mean to the people who in the other<br>lecturer Melissa this thing so young<br>people students coming in and I<br>originally thought it might be an<br>academic audience so haven't seen who's<br>coming I've decided to do four things<br>this morning I thought one I tell you<br>about what I actually do as a historian<br>to about the book I'm working on<br>the published in 2017 about the First<br>World War Marty participation in it and<br>three I thought especially for the young<br>people here tell me a little bit little<br>bit about my life the challenges that<br>I've gone through and are finished by<br>give me some tips on how I chose to<br>overcome those challenges I work for the<br>ministry ministry for culture and<br>heritage I'm a senior and starring with<br>them you don't know anything about that<br>ministry they have a group of historians<br>and who write the government's histories<br>and at the moment we are working on<br>centennial publications around world war<br>one or one with from nineteen fourteen<br>to nineteen eighteen it's about nine<br>books being prepared I was given the<br>task of writing the one on Marty<br>participation in the First World War and<br>I'm also with the EOP museum as it's one<br>story in wisdom i should say put a plug<br>into the government because the<br>investment they have made in mobile one<br>and they did this back in 2013 but<br>losses in that year 70 million was put<br>up to commemorate our contribution as we<br>Zealanders to the First World War and<br>right to serve kids population wear our<br>uniform bring over 1000 people there<br>were sixty thousand Kennedy 80,000 died<br>that's right that we should commemorate<br>their and I acknowledge the government<br>through it however in 2013 that was all<br>also<br>you are you made them commemorated that<br>over here in other parts of the country<br>will pass on and I think until we are as<br>a nation I able to revisit that period<br>of our past when we will not be mature<br>commemorate the losses of war for one<br>where our men and woman died fighting<br>the liberty of other countries not our<br>Boston and now that I've been right on<br>right here is a very good example of<br>being a woman who died fighting for the<br>iron country and we most ignore it<br>nourishes I've spent the last couple of<br>days being taken around wake up the<br>money or puto and interesting what<br>memorials end here to mark that period<br>in our history and I think on the modern<br>sci-fi story it's almost silent except<br>for the remains of those battles that<br>were fought here in the wake of them so<br>I'm writing about global one and if you<br>don't know there are roughly two and a<br>half thousand Marty who went overseas<br>and served in what was called the Mardi<br>contingent and that became the new<br>zealand pioneer battalion but they were<br>also in every other provincial battalion<br>the book by the way the title is feed to<br>keep and that comes from the call to<br>arms in 1914 that was put out by the<br>Marty MPs Tweety Kiki 5050 air and in<br>the old days that meant to put on your<br>war belt gird your loins with your war<br>bout to get ready for war and so that's<br>the title chosen for the book I think<br>it's very appropriate we found them at<br>all when we were working on that book<br>that I catchphrase people seem to<br>remember remember the Maori short title<br>then they do the rest of the long tail<br>so most of you who have seen how humble<br>tall probably don't know what its full<br>title is the price of citizenship so<br>that so 2017 look for that title for you<br>to keep it will be other it talks about<br>the modding experience they 500 of them<br>were taken to avondale and train from<br>every tribe in this country even wake up<br>despite the views of the leadership here<br>there were one or two like they do today<br>didn't listen and with the listed any<br>help you know my son is enrolling for<br>the army under you it should be in next<br>year he's just too lady no encouragement<br>from me I got him we're watching the<br>news one day and we were watching what's<br>going on in Iraq and Afghanistan I said<br>son in 12 months time that's where<br>you'll be fighting those people over<br>there that's the reality of what's going<br>on moment just went over is here<br>determine any way is making fun to be<br>army that's the main reason he's he's a<br>Muslim did school buddies have gone<br>there he knows it's a good income he'll<br>get to see the world and there's<br>privileges have come with it and I think<br>that was young man 1914 had the same<br>expectation because of 1914 everybody<br>thought the war would started in August<br>was going to be over by Christmas<br>nobody realized it was going to be a<br>five-year Paul so it looks at their<br>experience in Oakland and 500 Marty<br>coming from different tribes of never<br>being put together before it must have<br>been really interesting for them to come<br>together in one camp and live together<br>well I know the stories in our area<br>about when naughty throw came up against<br>Napoli and Evan dough and they<br>remembered their early history and I'm<br>sure it was the same for all you mean it<br>took them a while some months to meld<br>them together into a cohesive unit we<br>realized we are not the enemy we have a<br>common enemy overseas they went off to<br>Egypt from temporary 1915 and they were<br>going in there as garrison troops<br>garrison troops guard stores and<br>supplies and look after prisoners<br>weren't actually being sent to fight in<br>the front line which disgusted them<br>because they were from a warrior<br>tradition and they believe that they<br>should do as as others the Parker<br>Brothers and something else i will<br>explain to you about the motivation by<br>their pocket game and then i'll talk a<br>little bit about what happened here the<br>3d article three talks have got the<br>rights of British citizenship but that<br>conferred upon you with those rights of<br>the obligations and expectations of<br>being a citizen of this country so that<br>when your country goes to war you're<br>supposed to step up and the Marty<br>leaders at that time was saying they<br>love the view that well who should step<br>up first the time of phenol there more<br>reason to do it and it was under that<br>guy's that a lot of them a lot of the<br>elders agreed for the men to go after<br>war and they've got to Egypt we found<br>that they weren't going to be fighting<br>that they sent to the island of Malta to<br>garrison the dead island while everybody<br>else went off to kalaipuli the story of<br>Marty on Gallipoli is really an untold<br>story unappreciated they arrived there<br>in July and remember<br>Deus win lovely well New Zealanders in<br>Australia's first landed on Gallipoli<br>but it wasn't until July when high<br>casualties were occurring that the Maori<br>contingent of 500 men with it there and<br>they were raring to go because this was<br>the opportunity to prove who they were<br>that they were they were equal to<br>anybody else and the hope was that<br>they'd be treated that way when they<br>came home as he was so when they got the<br>opportunity and Chuck Barris the battle<br>they were involved in in August 915 they<br>were outstanding and the book will<br>account for that you know you Marty can<br>tell you how good they were any in cali<br>but it's the letters from parker<br>servicemen from australians from british<br>soldiers who would witness them in<br>action it's the story of the 28th Maori<br>battalion in World War two you see it in<br>their fathers and the uncles in World<br>War one when they were told to attack at<br>night without any rounds and a magazine<br>but I painted on your rifle so you<br>couldn't fire a shot go up and if<br>anybody been deliberately knows what I'm<br>talking about I really really steep<br>terrain with a Turkish I entrenched and<br>clear them without using shots and to do<br>it all with the Boehner the hukka rang<br>out that night on the slopes of sonic<br>fear come up there in different places<br>and it was really the one successful<br>moment in the whole of the Gallipoli<br>campaign for New Zealanders and it<br>wasn't just Marty Marty and Parker who<br>went together to clear those foothills<br>and if anybody knows the story of<br>Chinook beer and Malone who got the<br>Wellington battalion on top there and<br>suffered heavy casualties and then we we<br>lost those those Heights well in that<br>fighting 100 bodies were became<br>casualties Kilburn and then in the next<br>three months that they were there their<br>numbers fell to below 100 500 guys<br>landed they were down to under<br>100 the rest had been taken off the<br>island and we were covering the<br>hospitals either from being wounded or<br>sick so much so that when they left<br>Gallipoli you could no longer I keep<br>that unit going so they were reformed<br>into a pioneer battalion and they went<br>to France as pioneers and done a lot of<br>pioneers they dig the trenches they put<br>down the duck walks there widen saps<br>they put the roads down but they do it<br>all very close to the front line and<br>they are suffering casualties as they do<br>that work they thought Gallipoli was bad<br>but when they got to France and<br>experience the psalm machine planned<br>that area it was twice as bad and<br>throughout world war one to say they're<br>about 2500 Modi who went across to keep<br>that unit reinforcements and that's<br>really what the story is Isabel but it's<br>also about what happened here at home<br>because a unit overseas is really only<br>the spearhead of what takes place back<br>here you you've got to keep it to give<br>an Army overseas you've got to supply it<br>from back here in New Zealand and who<br>did all that work back here but the<br>woman because the men were gone the men<br>folk were gone the Mardi population then<br>was only 50,000 that was the time when<br>they were smoothing the pillow of a<br>dying race everybody believed that even<br>Marty that it wouldn't be long before<br>the race was exterminated through<br>disease and things like that so for two<br>and a half thousand Marty to go out of<br>population of 50,000 that's pretty<br>impressive but you have to look below<br>I'll let you dwell on this photograph<br>that some of you may may be seen for the<br>first time this is to prayer in 1917 the<br>man with there is William to the<br>pit who was the officer the Mardi<br>highest-ranking Marty officer at<br>Gallipoli he had returned home and he'd<br>become the first president of the RSA in<br>New Zealand tomorrow and there's an<br>interesting story about his daughter<br>here Peggy Alexandra I don't know any<br>you remember her she looked to over 90<br>in Gisborne where I am at the moment she<br>was born in Egypt first model be born<br>over there because her mother stowed<br>away I with them sepideh bucks wife and<br>followed their husbands to war why well<br>Thank You Peggy told me it's because<br>they didn't trust them she was pregnant<br>when she left and in 1915 before they<br>came home she gave birth to a daughter<br>in Alexandria was her second name<br>thee as I I don't know what will i need<br>to educate anybody hear about the way<br>cutter position and i'm not going to<br>steal the sun Tom's Tom Ross gonna be<br>speaking about this in one of the<br>decisions but it was an eye over to me<br>to understand why they took the position<br>they did during the war but you know<br>after studying it and examining it just<br>common sense when you had your land<br>stolen from you you know within 50 years<br>of the war starting when you knew people<br>in your family who had been killed in<br>the wars that went on around here and<br>then you're being asked the children the<br>grandchildren of these people to go off<br>to fight in a war with the country you<br>know nothing about<br>nothing to you you would be scratching<br>your head about why would I why would I<br>do that and I have some sympathy because<br>my grandfather was living here and wake<br>up till just before World War one he was<br>from late a torn apart before par30 key<br>Marquis Farah katana thermocol Horry but<br>he because his father died he went<br>across to his cousin when I scroll r<br>peed on the matter to his cousins and he<br>worked on the farm there when the war<br>broke out so he ended up going with his<br>mates from that side of the country and<br>across to to fight I think if he if you<br>are still living here it wouldn't go and<br>so we see that if you look at the<br>numbers of boycott or men who who went<br>in relation to early it's only a handful<br>the travesty is that they applied<br>transcription to Maori in 1917 but they<br>only applied it to this district to make<br>an example of those in the King hunger<br>really and that the fact that they stood<br>by their principles and even went to<br>prison rather than go because they<br>didn't believe that they should you know<br>is you have to admire it and I think<br>back now you know a hundred years later<br>who was actually right because our<br>people on that side of the island to say<br>we went to get equality in this country<br>I know that when they came back from<br>nineteen eighty nine words to the Second<br>World War things didn't change very much<br>in this country today actually make the<br>right call there because the losses for<br>those who win a tremendous but for those<br>who didn't go there tarnished with thee<br>because people don't understand<br>with with the brush almost a<br>conscientious objectors when it's much<br>deeper than there despite not going<br>though to priya is in this photograph in<br>1917 at a fundraising event for the war<br>that's taken at the bungalow and why I'm<br>a thickening and this next one that<br>group of woman on the Maho of<br>proteinuria Nui away couple assisting<br>with the fundraising effort for the<br>soldiers overseas because as I<br>understand that the principal was while<br>our boys might be over there and in big<br>numbers we understand that in terms of<br>defending the country we have a part to<br>play and I think we romanticize<br>sometimes because it's so long ago what<br>actually happened back in but you know<br>photographs don't lie so that's what I'm<br>doing and I'm very fortunate to be doing<br>something that I that I enjoyed and if<br>you pick the right subject to write<br>so you you can't write about France<br>Belgium in England and Gallipoli without<br>actually going there to see the leather<br>denim which is the very reason I'm going<br>around this area looks how can you write<br>about what happened to here in nineteen<br>fourteen to nineteen eighteen if you've<br>never never been here and you've never<br>seen the places and it's it's an eye<br>open i mean i look at the country here<br>in comparison to the east coast and I<br>can see why you know the fertile flat<br>rolling undulating hills here compared<br>to the hilly country that I come from<br>why they would want to send before they<br>wanted else we're lucky that we're so<br>isolated and probably farming over there<br>wasn't going to be to affect it right<br>now I'm going to tell you a little bit<br>about my life this is fifteen years ago<br>when we were the first Maori graduates<br>at Massey University and I'm showing you<br>this picture as well I might look good<br>everybody has their troubles in life so<br>you think about what i look like they're<br>then i'll tell me the story of where i<br>come from i was born in saket anya with<br>my father's from paddle and don't<br>remember remember too much about those<br>early years but i spent my life was<br>spent between hillel hard amo where my<br>mother's from andrew near door Toria and<br>my father's people and we lived in Coto<br>in and around oratoria for the early<br>years of my life at six years of age are<br>struck down by romantic fever which was<br>going through our coast at the time and<br>I don't know from memory how many months<br>I was in hospital but it was at least<br>six months into pre a hospital and I<br>missed the whole of my second year<br>from a our grandparents farm aid a lot<br>of lot of children and we moved back to<br>the case because my grandmother had<br>passed away and there were all these for<br>my children to be taken care of and Hugh<br>infect to stay with their look after the<br>grandfather why is a wonderful thing for<br>those who've experienced that I've<br>uncles and aunties I used to wonder why<br>I called everybody uncle analogy but it<br>was real we are connected in some way<br>through far line but you can have its<br>negative aspects I was abused sexually<br>as a as a child at six year old one<br>second old hospital and I know the shame<br>that goes with it that the you know the<br>who blames himself for what the<br>perpetrator did to them and I know there<br>are people in this hall and it's thought<br>at ten years of age my parents separated<br>and I was sent to live with an uncle and<br>Palmerston North it was an ex mums<br>brother he was examining Korea so<br>probably from those early years I was<br>influenced by their military thing then<br>I was sent off to boarding school at the<br>age of 12 Marty boys boarding school<br>Catholic one we were Anglicans not that<br>I knew much about what that meant but I<br>put you at a disadvantage but I learned<br>very quickly to survive an ahmadi boys<br>boarding school when you other you know<br>at the bottom of the ladder third form<br>and being one of the smaller guys you<br>had to be either cooked with your tongue<br>or learn to fight which you know when I<br>tried out for the army you say yes you<br>know that what I've been through at<br>boarding school was no different i<br>thought in throwing up the other says ah<br>but i miss youi in the first year i said<br>it i want to do to be a teacher so I<br>knew had to go get a university<br>qualification and then I got expelled in<br>the second year because we were I<br>suppose we've been at boarding school<br>too long in my year group we got into<br>drinking a lot of alcohol got caught<br>doing it several times I remember what<br>they said to me as I as he gently on my<br>way so you will never amount to anything<br>in life and that's the last words he<br>said to me so I left school I remember<br>going home to my mother and this is the<br>culture I grew up with it was a party on<br>that home and she told me often every<br>word swear with you could think of but<br>then she said we're having some drinks<br>just been expelled you another one it's<br>just been expelled from school he's on<br>the bottom of the heap and and then he<br>said he qualified it and he said but<br>he'll bounce back and I tell you that<br>because I'm going to get to how I have<br>it comes to some of these things and<br>what people say to you or what you hear<br>them say about you it's extremely<br>important and you need to remember this<br>for your your own children or friends<br>that that you talk to so matic fever<br>muskil abused as a child from divorced<br>parents expelled from school but 20<br>years after all of that happened that's<br>me up there in that picture how does one<br>get from where I was to graduating with<br>a doctorate took me three years to get a<br>university entrance and the only reason<br>I got the third years because they<br>brought accrediting him and I was given<br>it I went off the university I didn't<br>understand how universities work they<br>didn't know anybody saved my older<br>brother who had just started who'd been<br>to university so I didn't know anybody<br>with a degree I didn't know what was<br>possible and I went then I pretty much<br>flunked the first year but then an in<br>terms of overcoming I started to read<br>about people who had succeeded in her<br>life where that challenges I remember<br>reading about this woman Romana Banuelos<br>this is a Mexican and at 16 she had two<br>children the partner had left her and<br>she shifted from Mexico to America with<br>seven dollars in her pocket and Aunty<br>and she started she bought a tortilla<br>machine he started making mexican food<br>and they started to build up a business<br>through that she became an inner town<br>you know the biggest supply of mexican<br>food and that kept going until she was<br>on a millionaire and then she's got some<br>of the latino business people in that<br>area and they created the first bank<br>for Mexicans because they wanted to<br>support their own people in business and<br>she ended up in the 90 early 1970s<br>becoming the 34th treasurer of the<br>United States under President Richard<br>Nixon so I looked at that and thought<br>well you can come from that to that<br>position anything's possible another<br>person I looked at was up it on another<br>when he was 6 years of age he didn't<br>speak English until after the age of six<br>he was he was sent off to after primary<br>school they were sent off to charity and<br>from Dairy chair as a young was a<br>teenager to pro to Canterbury University<br>first model you mentioned being in a<br>university will yield the only one of<br>your eyes how challenging that must have<br>been but he comes out as a 19 year old<br>1920 of the law degree and they are<br>bachelors and we know what he goes on to<br>in fact in the house when he was in<br>Parliament they said he spoke better<br>english and was more educated they're<br>more qualified than anybody else in<br>Parliament so I looked at those sort of<br>things and I read a lot about people who<br>had succeeded and that started to change<br>my thinking when I was six I was given<br>these penicillin tablets to take by the<br>doctor he said you take these three<br>times a day to the 18 I took them to<br>when I was 12 when I went to you know<br>240 school if you'd last we won take<br>knows things I threw them away because<br>it was embarrassing and I was sick of<br>taking penicillin tablets by you know<br>all those years three times a day and I<br>remember the doctor said to me you never<br>you won't have a full healthy life<br>because of the relics even got soaked<br>but I'd never ever even though you said<br>that to be believed that and you know<br>that when I went to train for the SAS<br>they were telling me you have to be in<br>the top 1% of the people in this country<br>it's not really true you know max effect<br>mentally you have to be in the top 1% of<br>this country because they'll take you<br>well past your your fitness levels but<br>then I when I got and I thought back to<br>death doctor if I to listen to him and<br>what he said to me what he spoke over my<br>life back you know I may not have<br>advanced to anything in terms of things<br>that required fitness level there's a<br>couple of quotes i want to leave you<br>with some people might know where these<br>come from but one is as a man thinketh<br>in his heart so is he things you dwell<br>on in your mind by us to believe what<br>that stuff to told me what my Richter<br>told me when I walked out of school that<br>were affected me because eventually what<br>you think about comes to pass if you<br>think about it enough if you think about<br>positive things in what you can do in<br>love those things will start to appear<br>in your life absolutely believe it the<br>other thing I was talking about what's<br>the power of the tongue another saying<br>is life and death are in the power of<br>the tongue those who enjoy to eat<br>thereof and what that means is whatever<br>you say has a power of its own and I<br>learned not to speak of my children<br>things that you can't do it or you'll<br>never achieve that which will see it<br>over me because they carry that with<br>them now there's two types of people who<br>wants me where if you say that to me<br>I'll prove you wrong and that's really<br>what mine my life story has been every<br>time somebody said you can't do that or<br>I'll go into it I know there's a lot of<br>people like that but I know to having<br>coached sports teams you can't carry<br>some people will fold you if you say<br>that a week in them but it's very<br>important to watch what you say we have<br>a saying in my family my children are on<br>call it in and whenever they say<br>something negative I give a classic<br>example we went to geneseo last year and<br>Europe my daughter and my son were with<br>me and it was such a long trip to Europe<br>or North Africa on the plane 13 hours<br>and we're about to get on the plane and<br>we just done 11 hours and there was a<br>full plane where an economy Roxton and<br>my daughter go this is going to be a<br>terrible flight home and my son and I<br>looked at at each other which they will<br>not for us we're going to have the best<br>flight out of all the flights to and<br>from this can be the best fight for us<br>she knew exactly what we're talking<br>talking about kuzma city you call that<br>and we're calling listen well we got on<br>this plane and we noticed the middle row<br>all the way down between hardly anybody<br>sitting we're waiting for the plane full<br>up and the hostess came up to us and<br>said mystery sitting to get up wind once<br>the planes taking off you may all move<br>over there and have four seats each<br>sleep the whole life<br>and we were over there were smiling with<br>us at our daughter my son tonight<br>because we had proved to hear that what<br>you say does actually matter this last<br>but typical people that that because<br>you're probably thinking of know is that<br>really all that has been to his life to<br>change it I had they the only thing i<br>can describe the sense as they have a<br>supernatural I suppose a supernatural no<br>meeting but supernaturally influenced by<br>the god of our forefathers and some of<br>you some of you in the air who are<br>spiritual know what I'm talking about<br>you know all Mardi generally are<br>spiritual he's just gotta press the<br>right button<br>you think about it every who you we<br>start with the prayer we end with a<br>prayer or boarding school we did<br>everything you know what credit do<br>catholics start everything with a prayer<br>in front of the prea you don't know you<br>don't think much about it at the time<br>but when you something happens to you<br>that makes you realize that no there is<br>a God it's real and that nobody can<br>change your mind about there that's what<br>happened to me and I realized that all<br>these friends we do and we start with a<br>prayer in with a prayer there's actually<br>something to it and that's another<br>reason why I admire the way cutters<br>through when I looked at Tavia and<br>prayer and the spiritual nests of those<br>people that carries right through to<br>today that really is the secret to my<br>life despite all the the tips are giving<br>you that changed my life and then some<br>the naval you ever talk about these<br>things no publicly when most people<br>would be generous to deliver that then<br>i'll call it though then I'll go no<br>further<br>Thank You Monty for sharing much more<br>than a story of World War one and I<br>think that was a powerful sharing with<br>us but in a way to me the story of your<br>personal life and the story of why Marty<br>would have engaged in world war one do<br>kind of parallel each other in the sense<br>of the context in which we are called to<br>be whatever era whether we're called to<br>fight on a war overseas or our era now<br>we also call to be courageous we're call<br>to care over and above our usual caring<br>for our culture and our people and so<br>thank you for sharing with us today once<br>again I think it's a great start to King<br>eating a day a connection if you like<br>with what you've been doing over the<br>last few months with the particular<br>story of waikato tannery and we'll War<br>one but linking that very much to 2015<br>and our story now and I guess you know<br>poor Marty the point you made about you<br>know the hundred years of fighting for<br>our own land and then the role and I<br>sent you know these are saying that the<br>victors always get to tell their stories<br>and the interesting thing with us<br>sometime so it always makes me laugh<br>that even when we like technically might<br>are lost technically<br>morally we won and we won morally<br>because to fight for your land is<br>morally correct that's why we have the<br>sense of doing what we should do doing<br>what we should do and I think we still<br>need to do that so please join me in<br>thanking our keynote speaker this<br>you</p></main><footer
