About the events that captured my imagination and focused my research for the next 30 years.”<br><br>Professor Masters is interested in psychological markers of the way in which people learn and perform skills. His research into implicit motor learning shows that it is possible to acquire real-life movement skills implicitly - without conscious access to, or awareness of, the knowledge that underlies performance of those skills.<br><br>The work crosses discipline boundaries into rehabilitation, surgery, speech sciences, movement disorders, ageing, sports sciences, psychology and developmental disorders and disabilities.<br><br>Professor Masters says he uses psychological principles to inform his research and that has led to fascinating insights into the way in which humans perform skills.<br><br>“I put those principles into a movement context.”<br><br>He will discuss how people consciously overthink situations, often to their detriment, and how the unconscious can be used to much greater effect than the conscious.<br><br>Professor Masters is a professor in Te Oranga School of Human Development and Movement Studies. Prior to joining the University of Waikato, he held director and assistant director roles in the Institute of Human Performance at the University of Hong Kong and before that, he lectured in the School of Sport and Exercise Sciences at the University of Birmingham, England.<br><br>Professor Masters’ lecture, From knowledge, knerves and know-how to rules, reputation and reinvestment: The epic story of implicit motor learning will be held at the Gallagher Academy of Performing arts on 22 September 2015 at 6pm.

knew e peer<br>code to Qatar greetings to all of you<br>and I particularly strong greetings to<br>my family you often have to listen to me<br>banging on about stuff that usually not<br>in quite such a public place I guess<br>before I start I should acknowledge all<br>the people whose colleagues friends<br>accomplices who have been with me on the<br>journey last 20 25 years of my research<br>I'm very grateful to all of them and I'm<br>very proud of the fact that I'm friends<br>with all of them still unsupervised<br>about 2425 PhD students there are some<br>PhD students in the room at the moment<br>who I'm very proud to be supervising so<br>this is not a journey that I take I've<br>taken on my own it's a journey that I've<br>shared with many many people and I'm<br>proud to have shared it I recall the<br>moment that I fell in love with science<br>I was on the second floor botargo<br>University Library<br>I was sitting in one of the little<br>cubicles it's late at night on a Friday<br>it was quiet and I was working on my<br>honors dissertation and I was working on<br>something called mental practice and<br>even then I was interested in the way we<br>learn skills and we perform skills and<br>as a lazy young teenager I rather liked<br>the idea of mental practice because<br>mental practice involves basically<br>sitting back doing nothing and seeing<br>yourself getting better in your head I<br>had a hypothesis my hypothesis was that<br>the mental practice effect may well be a<br>meditation effect that is if you do<br>mental practice your performance and<br>pros because you<br>you kind of concentrate and that's<br>exactly what happens when you do<br>meditation so I was reading up on things<br>like meditation and I noticed that when<br>you do meditation you often get that<br>circulation of the forearms and the<br>wrists in other words you get increased<br>blood flow to the forearms and I thought<br>to myself would that be cool if I could<br>discover that when people do mental<br>practice they also get increased blood<br>flow forums that would kind of connect<br>meditation and mental practice together<br>and so I started searching the journals<br>I hunted and hunted and hunted and at<br>last I came across evidence if you like<br>that indeed in mental practice this<br>vasodilation or increased blood flow to<br>the forearms actually the kids ah<br>gene I was pleased myself I felt like a<br>detective I felt like a Miss Marple<br>although I had a mustache so perhaps I<br>felt like for our pyro<br>although pyro is bit old maybe magnum<br>p.i more like it although if I think<br>about it I mean this knife will actually<br>probably head in the stash so perhaps I<br>was more like Miss Marple so I was<br>hooked I was hooked on science and I was<br>hooked on research and I decided to do a<br>PhD and I was offered a scholarship to<br>go to University of York in the UK and<br>as all young Kiwis do it was really an<br>opportunity to to get to Europe you can<br>see with my Marelli's came from that<br>kind of stuff so I took a year to work<br>to earn some money to go it and I worked<br>as a picture framer in Dunedin and<br>during that year I came across some<br>studies if you like that changed the way<br>I thought about skill learning and in<br>fact the way I thought that life I used<br>to play chess with a gentleman who's one<br>of the best chess players in the country<br>and for the life of me I can't remember<br>was sick and they were like remembers<br>his first name is Venice so I used to<br>play chess with Denis in the picture<br>framers morning tea lunch afternoon tea<br>without fail we played chess for one<br>year and he was you know he's one of the<br>best chess players and he said I could<br>not get even remotely close to Denis and<br>I began to think well this is he was in<br>his 60s this is simply getting to<br>smarter than me he's hardwired to this<br>matter and then I came across work by<br>gentleman called Jason Simon in 1973 and<br>chasing shops hiring a done some work<br>and chess in which they'd compared<br>Grandmaster chess players with complete<br>novice chess players and what they'd<br>asked them to do is to look at a chess<br>board with pieces on it for five seconds<br>it's called the five-second recall times<br>and after five seconds the chess board<br>is removed and people asked to say how<br>many pieces run on the board and we were<br>they and what Jason Simon found was that<br>the grandmasters wasn't very very very<br>good at doing this task much better than<br>the novices but only when the pieces<br>were on the board in a games setting out<br>as a game if the pieces were on the<br>board and they were completely random<br>random positions it was absolutely no<br>difference in recall between the experts<br>and the novices and I was very relieved<br>by that because that told me that<br>expertise and skill isn't hardwired<br>expertise and skill is about the<br>knowledge that you acquire the way you<br>structure it and the way you use it so I<br>was awfully relieved and then I came<br>across the more literature it's changed<br>the way much of my philosophy even today<br>II W Crossman in 1959 had gone back and<br>processed 40 years of data from Cuban<br>cigar rolls<br>primarily ladies in Cuba<br>and Crossman had found some remarkable<br>data Crossman had found that in the<br>first year<br>these ladies generally rolled about 100<br>cigars but by 7 years of rolling cigars<br>that same one skills rolling a cigar<br>that's alleged after seven years they<br>dwelt 10 million cigars which is a<br>phenomenal number of cigars to roll and<br>to put it in context michael jordan<br>calculates that he threw about 1 million<br>passes in his career so well short of<br>the 10 million that Crossman found in<br>the cuban cigar wounds but that's not<br>why I'm telling you the story what is<br>remarkable about this data is that after<br>seven years and ten million cigars<br>crossbones data showed that these cigars<br>were still getting better they were<br>still getting faster and more efficient<br>at rolling cigars and that tells me<br>something about skill in fact it tells<br>me something of their life there's no<br>reason for you to slow down there's no<br>reason that you can't continue to get<br>better and better and more and more<br>skilled and all you have to do is<br>overcome fatigue boredom injury whatever<br>it is but your skill levels can continue<br>to improve because you're never going to<br>complete 10 million trials of whatever<br>skilled as you wish to improve so I got<br>on a plane and went to York to York<br>University very exciting times and at<br>York I was influenced by another person<br>another gentleman and his name was Scott<br>Hoch and he influenced me for all the<br>wrong reasons because Scott Hoch was a<br>professional golfer and in 1989 he was<br>in the u.s. Masters Tournament and he<br>was leading the tournament and he was on<br>the final hole on the final day and he<br>had a putt that was about this long and<br>all he had to do is to knock that putt<br>in and he was going to win the<br>tournament<br>he's been chased hard by very famous<br>English golfer called Nick Faldo and you<br>guessed it Scott I've missed that<br>two-foot putt<br>it's called give me and go so that<br>allowed them to go to a playoff and on<br>the very next hole Scott hope missed<br>another pot of the same distance and<br>Nick Faldo won the tournament so poor<br>Scott Hoch missed out on winning<br>probably at those days a million us<br>understand on the fame and the fortune<br>and so on and he was clearly very very<br>gutted and his response to why he had<br>failed under the immense pressure of<br>making those putts was that he as he<br>stood over the putts he knew too much<br>about what he was doing he was too aware<br>of making the putts so I saw this I<br>processed this and I had to if you like<br>light bulb moments of you wish to call<br>them that firstly as a concept of<br>reinvestment reinvestment is a very<br>simple concept it is a tendency to<br>consciously control your movements and<br>in watching what had happened to Scott<br>Hoch I started to wonder perhaps people<br>have different dispositions to<br>consciously control their movements<br>maybe you can measure those and so I<br>developed something that's been come<br>known as the theory of reinvestment a<br>theory of reinvestment proposes that we<br>all have different personalities<br>dispositions in terms of how much we're<br>likely to consciously monitor and<br>control our movements and over many<br>years we've shown this but you can<br>measure the reinvestment using<br>psychometric scales and that it<br>discriminates all sorts of different<br>populations so stroke patients for<br>example in comparison to age-matched<br>controls display very high levels of<br>reinvestment so high levels of culture<br>control elderly fallers compared to<br>elderly non Fuller's display the same<br>discrimination very high levels of<br>reinvestment Parkinson patients the<br>longer a Parkinson patient has had the<br>disease for higher they score on the<br>reinvestment scale so over time their<br>personality disposition changes if you<br>like and they use more and more<br>conscious control of their movement you<br>might wish to think of it as<br>overthinking you've all done it recently<br>it is possibly the roads that have been<br>icy and you may have slipped and then as<br>you walked from then on for a few<br>minutes you found yourself thinking very<br>carefully about how are you were walking<br>an order not to slip again so<br>reinvestment was one concept that Scott<br>aligned with this concept of<br>reinvestment I started to wonder is it<br>possible that you can learn your skills<br>with no conscious knowledge so that you<br>can't do reinvestment is it possible<br>that Scott Hoch could have acquired his<br>skills in such a way that when he stood<br>over those parts he had no information<br>he couldn't consciously think about what<br>he was doing because there was nothing<br>to bring to consciousness<br>I turned to this implicit motor learn<br>and ingest I described this talk as the<br>epic journey of implicitly Lepik story<br>of implicit learning I'd like to think<br>so but I'm not foolish enough to kid<br>myself the thing about learning<br>unconsciously it's actually not as silly<br>as it sounds so if we go back about one<br>and a half million years we get to the<br>arquillian period and in the arquillian<br>industry Nappers used to create style<br>flight flight stone or flint and these<br>to create things like spearheads now<br>what you<br>here is actually an s twist hand ass and<br>there's the s twist a bit like a<br>propeller and our ancestors made axes<br>out of these and these are very very<br>sophisticated axes because when you<br>strike with the sax<br>you can twist it and then twisting it<br>you can get the ax to dig deeper rather<br>like a screw screwing into wood you can<br>get it to go deeper but by twisting the<br>X back the other way you can loosen it<br>very very easily and very quickly these<br>are very sophisticated tools in order to<br>make one of these tools something very<br>special had to happen for our ancestors<br>they had to be able to hold in mind<br>information because when you flake one<br>side of this stone you then have to turn<br>it over to flake the other side in the<br>opposite direction which means you have<br>to hold in mind what the other side<br>looks like and Oh since this one and a<br>half million years ago was the beginning<br>of development of what we now know of<br>this working memory and working memory<br>is absolutely vital because working<br>memory is what allows us to to to learn<br>languages to speak to test hypotheses to<br>hold information at a party when someone<br>gives you their phone number working<br>memory does that for you so this one and<br>a half million years ago was the<br>beginning of human language if you like<br>of human consciousness of the human<br>ability to hold and use knowledge so if<br>if you go back before we had language<br>before the arquillian period we still<br>had to move and we still had to move<br>effectively if we didn't move<br>effectively read I doubt so we only had<br>unconscious processes if you like<br>nonverbal implicit processes available<br>to us<br>when we went hunting and we got to take<br>by a saber-tooth tiger if we became so<br>anxious when we threw that stone to ward<br>off the tiger that we missed because we<br>were so anxious<br>what happened was we died so all<br>implicit mechanisms in essence died out<br>they weren't stable and robust only<br>stable robust unconscious implicit<br>mechanisms that survived and I contended<br>that even now we have vestigial parts of<br>the brain that if we can reactivate<br>those during learning we can create<br>learning which was incredibly powerful<br>incredibly robust incredibly stable<br>under things like psychological stress<br>so this is the first paper I published<br>and it is a paper that's been cited many<br>many many times and in it I basically<br>tried to evoke these vestigial<br>mechanisms of the brain by using a very<br>very simple approach I asked people to<br>learn a task while doing a secondary<br>tails simple as that so if I asked the<br>the senior vice chancellor for example<br>to come up here and or senior deputy<br>vice-chancellor shall I say to come up<br>here and to begin a juggling for us if<br>he's near the juggler before and if I<br>asked him to count backwards and seven<br>from 1422 while he was doing it he would<br>find that extremely difficult to do he's<br>remarkable man so naturally he could do<br>it<br>what is amazing however is that he would<br>learn to juggle he would be I'm aware of<br>how he was learning to juggle because<br>his mind is so concentrated on<br>generating numbers counting backwards<br>that he would not know how he was doing<br>the juggling p'jem would be able to do<br>the juggler and if I then placed an<br>under extraordinary stress I can't<br>offhand anything how I might do that but<br>electric shocks jump to mind because<br>he'd learned in this implicit<br>unconscious way his juggling would<br>remain stable it wouldn't break down<br>under pressure pretty remarkable stuff<br>and we've shown this in many many in<br>hundreds of studies and not only<br>ourselves other people have replicated<br>this work again and again now I don't<br>have time to go into all the different<br>ways in which we can bring about<br>implicit learning so what I'm going to<br>do is just talk you through some of the<br>techniques we've used some of the ones<br>that I particularly like one of the one<br>weakness that we've used as analogy<br>learning an analogy learning you form a<br>mental model of a new concept simply by<br>aligning it with something familiar from<br>experience and what you can see here is<br>basically a solar system and what you<br>can see here is an atom is like a solar<br>system and in fact that is an analogy an<br>atom is like a solar system and our own<br>Ernest Rutherford used that analogy so<br>an atom has a nucleus with electrons<br>rotating around it in the same way that<br>a solar system has a Sun with planets<br>rotating around it and we used this<br>principle to do skill learning and this<br>is one of my favorite clips that I<br>thought I would show you so this is<br>I'm not gonna share ours by the way that<br>imagine if I was trying to teach you<br>that by giving you rules and explicit<br>instructions in other words getting you<br>to consciously control how you did it it<br>wouldn't be easy with it what if I used<br>analogy though this is really mad<br>live at the Apollo can you smell dog<br>let's our powerful analogy really is<br>remarkably simple but remarkably<br>effective way to bring about effective<br>skill learning another technique<br>technique we use is errorless learning<br>speaks for itself doesn't it BF Skinner<br>trained use discriminate learning to<br>train pigeons Heather how to pick a red<br>dot<br>so basically very simple whenever the<br>pigeon picked the red dot<br>it was rewarded with food whenever it<br>picked the green dot it wasn't so over<br>time the pigeon would learn hit the red<br>dot would be conditioned to realize the<br>red dot was the one that had it was<br>gonna give it food that was an error a<br>trial and error process for the pigeon<br>it would pick the red dot then it picked<br>the green dot nothing for the green dots<br>that pick the red dot again and<br>eventually it would learn to<br>discriminate the Skinner had a very<br>smart PhD student called Herbert Terrace<br>and Herbert Terrace did something really<br>cool Herbert Terrace learn taught<br>pigeons how to discriminate perilously<br>all he did was showed the pigeon the red<br>light dot nice and bright and clear and<br>the pigeon pigeon would pick it it would<br>get fed and then he presented the green<br>dot very very faint so faint the pigeon<br>barely saw it so the pigeon would ignore<br>it and gradually and then he present the<br>red dot again and the digital partner<br>would get fed and gradually increase the<br>density of the green dot and the<br>brightness gradually and gradually and<br>gradually but thing was it was so slow<br>pigeon never actually picked the green<br>light it only ever picked the red light<br>so it learned to discriminate red from<br>green having never made an error and<br>what Herbert terrace<br>this is 1936 reports is that the pigeons<br>were psychologically happier having made<br>no errors<br>learning it goes against our typical<br>view of how you should learn everyone<br>says how you should learn by making<br>mistakes actually we have a vast amount<br>of literature that shows that actually I<br>was learning is a very powerful tool and<br>it evokes different mechanisms when you<br>learn I'll give you one lovely example<br>one of my favorites in this particular<br>study we asked older people over 70<br>years and younger people of the other<br>judges 19 or 20 something like that to<br>learn a golf puting tasks and we asked<br>them to learn it by practicing from long<br>distances where they made lots of<br>mistakes so they learned in a very<br>conscious trial and error manner or we<br>asked them to learn from really short<br>distances where they made no mistakes at<br>all so what you see here is a person<br>starts cutting from 25 centimeters less<br>than Scott hopes mr. platts so they<br>don't miss any and then they gradually<br>get a little bit further away a little<br>bit further away so very similar to here<br>that Terrace is principal this is what<br>you see for the explicit conscious<br>learners as you would expect the older<br>people learn slower they're always worse<br>in their learning and that's what you<br>would expect that's what we're told as<br>you get older you learn more slowly and<br>you know less effectively their implicit<br>learners the unconscious learners<br>errorless learners absolutely no<br>different and we've replicated that work<br>on a number of occasions now so our<br>techniques our l:l paradigm if you like<br>areas paradigm there's a very powerful<br>paradigm this is probably my favorite<br>clip another technique we've used is<br>subliminal learning I don't have time to<br>go into it in detail but watch this very<br>good claims they want you to do this<br>in his deck I want you to try to see one<br>card not this one but look closely try<br>to see one inside did you get one yeah<br>I'll do it again it might have been too<br>quick try to see it hard inside if you<br>can't did you see what do you think you<br>didn't don't say it just hold it in your<br>mind you know this is not it but<br>visualize your card right here did<br>anyone pick the Queen of Spades did<br>anyone pick a king by any chance this is<br>this is real magic this is psychological<br>magic so what David Blaine does I mean<br>you wouldn't even describe this is a<br>trick these discs uses psychological<br>principles he flicks through the cards<br>you'll notice they flicks through the<br>cards holding them like that that's<br>because he can control the cards very<br>carefully with this finger he shows the<br>last card slightly longer than all of<br>the other cards he shows it at what we<br>called your sub subjective threshold<br>what that means is that you see the card<br>but you're not aware that you've seen it<br>not until it's pointed it up to you so<br>when he says pick a card pick any card<br>you pick the card that he showed you if<br>it's so fractionally longer at your<br>subject of threshold all of the other<br>cards he flipped through so quickly the<br>very what we call your object of<br>threshold so you don't see them it's a<br>very simple principle he's presented<br>information to you at below your your<br>limit if you like alignment of<br>consciousness but you've received the<br>information you just don't know you've<br>received the information we'll use this<br>principle would you like to see that<br>again go on then our deck of cards I<br>want you to do is from this deck I want<br>you to try to see one card not this one<br>we look closely try to see one inside<br>did you get one yeah I'll do it again it<br>might have been too<br>but try to see a card inside of each<br>other did you see what probably picked<br>it up they're gonna don't say it just<br>hold it in your mind you know this is<br>not it but visualize your card right<br>here so we've used that same principle<br>using what's called it to Kista scope<br>they don't make them anymore you can<br>present information to people at their<br>subject of threshold so if you're<br>teaching someone how to throw accurately<br>for example you can present information<br>to them about where their throw went<br>that they don't know they're getting<br>what's remarkable as they ended up<br>learning people get really really<br>accurate but they're looking in this<br>discuss the scope and the information<br>they're saying is so fast that they'll<br>say well isn't same thing you didn't<br>show me anything but in fact we did we<br>showed them where the target was and<br>where their throw had gone relative to<br>the target and if we force people to<br>guess where that where the throw went<br>that was surprisingly accurate so that's<br>a form of implicit learning that we've<br>used that's a lot of fun I wish I had<br>more time to talk about it we also have<br>lots of objective evidence of this idea<br>of enforcer motor learning and in in<br>some of our work we've used<br>electroencephalography and no matter how<br>many times I said I always stumble over<br>eg eg is measures electrical activity<br>that seeps through to the scalp and<br>different parts of the brain that are<br>active releasable more electrical<br>activity which seeps through the scalp<br>and we've used a concept called cortical<br>cortical communication to examine what<br>happens when people learn in this<br>unconscious profession so the frontal<br>cortex area here controls motor behavior<br>motor planning whereas the left temporal<br>area here the t-3 area controls verbal<br>analytical behaviour we had a very<br>simple hypothesis if we use these<br>techniques I've just shown you to train<br>people in certain skills when we measure<br>EEG during their performance what we<br>should see<br>if they've learned implicitly<br>unconsciously is very low communication<br>between those two areas which actually<br>is really simple a few things quite<br>elegant if you think about it basically<br>what we're saying is well if you've<br>learned implicitly there'll be no verbal<br>analytical involvement in controlling<br>the movement and that's exactly what we<br>find if I gave you the the reinvestment<br>questionnaire right now measured<br>everybody's propensity here to use<br>conscious control when they're when they<br>move it those of you who score high on<br>that scale and you would be people more<br>likely to fail into psychological<br>pressure for example because you'll tend<br>to overthink your movements you would<br>score very high in terms of your your<br>cortical cortical communication in other<br>words these areas would be talking to<br>each other a lot those of you who scores<br>very low on that scale would have very<br>low cortical cortical communication in<br>other words the motor planning would be<br>going on without any interference from<br>the volunteers and we've done this work<br>in surgery in the prosper V for example<br>we've shown that there's neural<br>efficiency when you learn implicitly in<br>surgery that that ends up be creating<br>very effective multitasking so surgeons<br>for example multitask is very important<br>our surgeon carrying out an operation<br>has to be able to monitor blood monitor<br>blood pressure and listen to the nurse<br>or the anesthetist and and respond when<br>he's asked to be like a cup of tea and<br>we've also began to do work in in<br>transcranial direct current stimulation<br>and when you use transcranial direct<br>current stimulation what you're actually<br>doing is you're passing a very mild<br>electric current through the brain and<br>you can encourage activity or suppress<br>activity of different parts of the brain<br>and what we've shown is this that if we<br>suppress using a catherdal current if we<br>suppress frontal activity frontal<br>activity is very conscious controlling<br>activity we can get people to learn and<br>personally so we can manipulate the way<br>people learn a skill just<br>by using transcranial direct current<br>stimulation to suppress frontal motor<br>area when they're learning the skill and<br>we're doing lots of work in this area at<br>the moment another thing that we've<br>started doing that's very exciting is<br>for a long time I've wondered about why<br>everybody examines falling in terms of<br>prevention so most a literature out<br>there is about how you prevent people<br>from falling and something that I'm very<br>interested in is not about preventing<br>falling it's about getting people to<br>fall safely<br>everyone's gonna fall eventually we've<br>all done it can you actually train<br>people to fall and be less likely to<br>injure themselves obviously with the<br>aging population in the world and in New<br>Zealand that would be pretty cool so I'm<br>very lucky to have in our department of<br>course no school should I say Karen<br>barber is that here in the audience my<br>Karen Olivia Karen teaches dance and<br>researchers and dance and we've been<br>talking and Karen said to people we<br>dancers that's pretty much the first<br>thing we do we learn how to fall spend<br>their whole career choreographing<br>falling so Karen and I are beginning to<br>explore the possibility that we can<br>track down effect we've got a summer<br>scholarship to begin the work track down<br>old dancers<br>find out whether they've fallen and find<br>out whether if they have fallen whether<br>they injure themselves less severely<br>than people in the normal population so<br>that's a really exciting project to be<br>part of and there's another element to<br>that because we find that older dancers<br>do fall more safely massively and hurt<br>themselves less severely now we have to<br>find a way to Train older people to fall<br>safely and that's where some of the<br>implicit no to learning paradigms that<br>I've talked about kick in and a perfect<br>example is an allergy learning<br>because the beauty of analogy learning<br>is that you can use the analogy very<br>quickly so we're talking in right now<br>we're testing a variety of different<br>analogies such as all like an octopus so<br>what happens when you tell someone to<br>fall like an octopus<br>you can't give someone instructions<br>explicit rules about how to fall safely<br>because on the way to the floor in that<br>one second that they have to decide how<br>to fall they don't get a lot of<br>opportunity to process a lot of rules at<br>a conscious level but the unconscious is<br>far faster so if we can use techniques<br>that in a sense evoke these vestigial<br>mechanisms that allow us to survive we<br>should find that we can get people to<br>fall more safely let's start just trying<br>to give you an idea of the kind of work<br>that we're currently doing so there lots<br>of this kind of work right I thought I<br>should finish with two so two of my<br>favorite studies and I've got to talk to<br>them something they're quite large so<br>they're four or five experiments in each<br>and I'm not going to talk about all of<br>those we this is really some recent<br>interests that I've started to get into<br>in terms of perception and human<br>performance the way we perceive the<br>world and the way that affects the way<br>we perform there is a literature out<br>there that shows that people in<br>authority are perceived to be taller<br>than they actually are<br>and people who are not an authority have<br>generally perceived to be smaller than<br>they are now one's examined that in in<br>terms of sport so this particular study<br>what we did is we showed people pictures<br>of David Beckham or Yale me and those<br>are the correct relative sizes by the<br>way Yao Ming is a very famous basketball<br>and as you can see he's a big boy so we<br>showed people pictures of perhaps here<br>yelling with the basketball between his<br>feet or perhaps David Beckham with a<br>soccer ball between his feet and on a<br>separate booklet we asked them to mark<br>relative<br>the soccer ball or the basketball how<br>told he was so we're interested in<br>whether the reputation of these athletes<br>have their soccer players or basketball<br>is actually influences people's<br>perceptions of their height so there's<br>an example of someone marking how high<br>perhaps the arming is in basketball this<br>is what you see David Beckham with a<br>soccer ball between his feet is<br>significantly his height is<br>significantly overestimated same thing<br>for young men but the basketball between<br>his feet he is significantly<br>overestimated his height however young<br>men with a soccer ball between his feet<br>he's not overestimated in fact he's<br>slightly underestimated and<br>interestingly enough David Beckham with<br>the basketball between his feet is also<br>overestimated which we didn't expect<br>because David Beckham has no reputation<br>as a basketball only as a soccer player<br>but of course David Beckham is more than<br>a soccer player now isn't he he's an<br>icon he's a media superstar he's gonna<br>be a the next James Bond I heard so he's<br>more than just a soccer player in a<br>second study we showed that I apologize<br>for the quality of this image this is<br>Jerzy Dudek from the 2005 UEFA Champions<br>League we showed people this static<br>image in a laboratory just like that and<br>we asked them to judge Jersey dude its<br>height in the goals all you need to do<br>is pick out which one of these<br>represented him standing in the goal and<br>they did this while the picture was<br>still up via so they were looking at the<br>picture when they did it that's actually<br>the correct size there so this is what<br>it looked like for participants who came<br>into the lab they saw the image they<br>estimated Jersey Davies high so there's<br>no difference is there basically then we<br>used a very simple intervention should<br>come up now here it is<br>half of the participants we showed Jerzy<br>Dudek making the save and the other half<br>we showed Jersey did it not making the<br>same there were four of you here it<br>comes<br>this is Jersey dude it making saved us<br>poor little one more the half of the<br>participants saw that that's all they<br>saw the other half saw Jersey did Jersey<br>did it not making sales credibly simple<br>manipulation this is what we saw failed<br>sales when Jerzy Dudek did not save<br>penalties suddenly people underestimated<br>his height the perception of his height<br>changed dramatically now look what<br>happened when he made sales people<br>suddenly overestimated aside so just<br>like that in a few seconds of showing<br>those videos we have manipulated Jersey<br>did extrude the reputation to the extent<br>that our people are now in our study<br>their estimations of his height changed<br>how relevant is that well this is<br>William Fatih folks and in 1905<br>Chelsea Football Club paid fifty pounds<br>there William thirty folks in those days<br>that was probably equivalent if I died<br>fifty five million or something just<br>like that what did they do<br>they raised feta fixes reputation so<br>just like that they probably made people<br>perceive him as taller than he he was<br>you'll notice he's already pretty tall<br>in fact he's one point nine three meters<br>tall and he was a hundred and twenty<br>seven cages which I'm reliably reliably<br>told is is just about here is any of the<br>All Blacks in fact it's heavier why does<br>he so big because it's obviously very<br>slow because those does you could<br>actually score a goal simply by crashing<br>into the goal keeper and knocking him<br>back over the line so hockey was needed<br>Chelsea for<br>within and still are pretty pretty smart<br>club and they're into their psychology<br>actually they used to put two small boys<br>behind the goal<br>whenever fatty fix was in goal they put<br>two small boys behind the goal to<br>exacerbate perceptions of his height not<br>actually if you look carefully there's<br>one of the small boys and in fact fatty<br>folks were so slow that whenever that<br>eyeball was kicked and it went past the<br>goal the little boys used to go and get<br>the ball and that's where the term ball<br>boy came from so every time you see one<br>building and you hear ball boys remember<br>this lecture interesting enough in<br>nature this phenomena is used this is<br>the great bell bird in Australian and<br>the great valour bird uses the same<br>phenomenon it creates a sized distance<br>gradient to make itself look bigger till<br>its mates so what it does is it puts<br>large stones and shells at the front of<br>its Bower and smaller ones in the<br>gradient coming towards the Bell it then<br>stands at the back<br>and voila it looks bigger than it<br>actually is pretty smart if I wasn't<br>married I would try that right last<br>study I thought we'd have a little bit<br>of audience participation so I want you<br>to tell me on which side of the bar<br>is there more space I want you to tell<br>me how confident you are as well left<br>that's agreed and you are you preset er<br>okay this is not real experiment blood<br>layer and I haven't got a fix for this<br>either let's try again<br>how about this time how come from the<br>right hand side okay cool let's try<br>again<br>okay well we're not so confident in Ali<br>don't say cocky now okay<br>left-hand side is slightly more space<br>try again and one more right very good<br>congratulations River got that right<br>let's talk afterwards one more time yeah<br>all right now that's good I hear someone<br>saying it's in the middle someone some<br>cynic thinks this is a trick oh yeah<br>yeah she denies you it will be indeed<br>it's not a trick<br>there's more space on the right-hand<br>side why am i showing you that well in<br>this particular paper published in<br>Psychological Science in 2007 we had<br>become interested in how a goalkeeper<br>can increase his or her chances of<br>making a sale now in goalkeeping<br>goalkeepers actually don't have a high<br>success rate they usually only save that<br>20% of penalties that are taken against<br>them so we started wondering well what<br>if the goalkeeper stands off-center what<br>if the goalkeeper stands right over to<br>the side of the goal maybe then that can<br>influence the kicker and the kicker will<br>go to the side of the war space that<br>makes sense doesn't it the problem is of<br>course the goalkeeper has got an awfully<br>long way to to dive to make a save so<br>that doesn't work so then we started<br>thinking what if the goalkeeper stands<br>just a tiny bit of center just enough so<br>that you subconsciously detect which<br>side has more space without realizing<br>that the goalkeepers doing it and you<br>kick to that side of the war space the<br>goalkeeper then wouldn't have to decide<br>which way to save the goalkeeper would<br>know that he or she had left more space<br>on the left-hand side and we then dived<br>that way so we tested that phenomenon<br>and I'm not going to talk you through<br>all of the studies but that's half a<br>percent by the way half a percent is<br>smallest difference that's called a just<br>noticeable difference<br>that you can detect you will think that<br>you're guessing that so many of you in<br>the last slide I showed would have<br>guessed that the more space on the right<br>that you would have because I was<br>forcing you to but you would have<br>thought that you as a total utter guess<br>it wasn't you actually detected it half<br>a percent it's a tiny amount of<br>difference to be able to detect and here<br>in one of our studies we asked people to<br>only kick a goal if the goal clip was in<br>the exact middle so we said only kick if<br>the goal keepers in the middle and what<br>you can see here there are the kicks so<br>when the goal keepers a tiny fraction of<br>Center people kick because they think<br>the goal keepers in the middle but<br>what's remarkable is from half a percent<br>up to three percent which is still very<br>small even though people are kicking<br>because they think the goal keepers in<br>the middle they kick to the side of more<br>space without even realizing it which is<br>quite remarkable we had a study in which<br>we used observational data and what's<br>remarkable is to be looked at 200<br>penalty clips from the world cup from<br>the African nations and European<br>Championships<br>we found that goalkeepers always nearly<br>was 96 percent understand off-center so<br>they don't need it's very difficult to<br>stand in the exact middle of a god<br>in fact I'll keep has stood on average<br>nearly ten centimeters off-center<br>without even realizing they were doing<br>it most importantly more penalties were<br>kicked to the side of more space so this<br>observational data showed us that<br>goalkeepers are standing off-center<br>without realizing they're standing<br>off-center and kicks are then being<br>directed to the side that has more space<br>so if goalkeepers knew this phenomenon<br>is occurring they would then dive to the<br>side of the more space and they'd be<br>more likely to make saves how powerful<br>final I'm not sure why the commentary is<br>in journals so yen's layman is clearly<br>standing off-center would you agree<br>witness Paul Scholz kicked he kicks the<br>side with more space layman goes that<br>way<br>now layman probably didn't know he was<br>standing up seems he didn't this is by<br>chance but I think my final video sums<br>it up really and I think it sums up<br>Helen how well I listen to my own family<br>because this is my own son ray so this<br>is Ray here he's a bit older now he's in<br>the audience tonight however that for<br>penalty isn't that sweet he's a very<br>smart lad well ahead of his years he<br>listens to his dead very carefully there<br>is where is he standing clearly<br>off-center smart boy how about that<br>qr-code Oh<br>my name is Roger Martin on the Dean of<br>security tangata the Faculty of<br>Education and it's my pleasure to just<br>offer a few concluding remarks and to<br>draw this evening to a close I think<br>rich you have kept us entertained and<br>certainly informed I think you<br>demonstrate the power of research in<br>science to challenge things that we<br>think intuitively are as they should be<br>I think the other thing about it that<br>each of us here can find an application<br>for everything that you have given us an<br>example of and it confirmed for me as<br>someone in education some things I need<br>to put to write I need to find all of<br>those previous teachers and coaches who<br>said to my parents Roger could do better<br>if he tried harder they should have said<br>Roger would do better if he just relaxed<br>it took us time and it didn't try hard<br>but I think those notions of<br>reinvestment have important applications<br>across many fields and certainly the<br>notions of implicit theory and I was<br>particularly drawn to the idea of<br>errorless learning and I think from my<br>perspective personally as an educator<br>that has presented me with some ideas<br>that I need to mull over and think about<br>I have seen some of Richard's work<br>before and particularly the work around<br>soccer goalkeepers and I have to say<br>it's influenced quite dramatically my<br>viewing of soccer now I'm looking very<br>carefully if there's penalty as to where<br>the where the goalkeepers standing of<br>course as this information becomes more<br>known of course that may be reverse<br>psychology and operate<br>but you've also shown I think that your<br>work takes you across many fields and<br>has many applications so I thank you for<br>sharing it with us I'm left with a<br>number of abiding images one is the<br>senior deputy vice-chancellor juggling<br>but actually it's only topped by my<br>image of you with a mustache so I would<br>ask you to join with me and again in<br>congratulating rich on such a fine<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
