my<br>pleasure to be here as the University of<br>W's new Vice Chancellor my name is Neil<br>Quigley it's my first University of w<br>inaugural professorial<br>lecture inaugural professorial lectures<br>are a way of the University uh<br>introducing its newly appointed<br>professors to The Wider<br>community in the short time that I've<br>been here uh I've been very impressed by<br>the extent of the University's<br>engagement with the community in the<br>region uh this is just one small part of<br>a much wider program of Engagement and<br>also an opportunity for the community to<br>understand the sort of work uh that our<br>academic leaders do becoming a Professor<br>is a significant Milestone uh in the<br>academic Journey it's the highest<br>academic rank uh within the university<br>uh and it's a rank that implies broad<br>research leadership uh leadership in<br>teaching and the ability to communicate<br>with the wider International Community<br>of<br>Scholars it's my pleasure now to call on<br>the dean of Education Professor Roger<br>Molson to introduce tonight's speaker<br>Roger<br>Cato professor John Williams is the<br>director of the technology environmental<br>Mathematics and Science Education<br>Research Center referred to as Tims in<br>the faculty of Education University of w<br>uh John teaches and supervises and<br>undertakes research in technology<br>education apart from New Zealand he has<br>worked and studied in a number of<br>African and Indian Ocean countries and<br>in Australia in the United<br>States he directed a nationally funded<br>investigation into the status of<br>Technology education in Australian<br>schools his current research interests<br>include mentoring beginning<br>teachers pck or pedagogical content<br>knowledge and electronic assessment of<br>performance he regularly presents at<br>International and national conferences<br>is a consultant on technology education<br>in a number of countries and is a<br>longstanding member of eight<br>professional<br>associations he is the editor of the<br>Australian Journal of Technology<br>education and is on the editorial board<br>of four other professional<br>journals he was the chief examiner for<br>design technology for the international<br>Balor organization from 2004 till<br>2010 John has authored or contributed to<br>over 240<br>Publications and in<br>2011 he was elected to the international<br>technology and<br>education and Engineering Education<br>Association Academy of fellows for<br>prominence in the<br>profession he holds an adjunct<br>professorial position at Edith Cowen<br>University in Perth and it is my<br>pleasure to welcome and introduce<br>Williams<br>Roger I like making stuff I really like<br>making stuff I think the inclination<br>began when I was uh young and working<br>with my father in the backyard shed he<br>was a mechanic and he was always<br>pottering around with some new kind of<br>invention those early experiences turned<br>out to be very influential for me in my<br>personal and professional<br>life I really enjoy making things from<br>wood this jewelry box for example is a<br>project I used to do with my students<br>and I generally made one alongside them<br>so I developed quite a collection over a<br>period of time uh the Timber is black<br>butt it's got a eucalyptus bur lid and<br>pine corner inserts to strengthen the<br>joints I'm sure you're all very<br>that this display cabinet I made from<br>recycled West Australian Jara it's a<br>lovely dense hardwood and for a design<br>like this where you need strong but slim<br>frames uh it's a very nice wood to work<br>with I also like building and when I<br>first moved to my house in New Zealand<br>uh this Frame was in the backyard with a<br>a nice swing seat in it but as soon as I<br>saw it I knew that that was the spot for<br>the pizza<br>oven so I worked out the proportions I<br>found the materials that were available<br>and over a period of a few months um I<br>built the oven so that my friends and<br>it my father's now retired but when he<br>visits from Australia he gets a bit<br>itchy if he doesn't have something to do<br>he's been a builder and a mechanic for<br>all his life so it's very hard for him<br>to leave that alone so two years ago we<br>built this fireplace together in the<br>backyard uh I did all the planning and<br>made the foundations and then we built<br>it while he was visiting<br>here before I got into it I didn't real<br>realiz the amount of technology and the<br>number of calculations that were<br>required to make it work well uh the<br>size of the front has to be a proportion<br>to the chimney size for example to make<br>sure there's an adequate drawer uh on<br>the<br>fire when we first moved to Newcastle in<br>the 1990s I had the opportunity to build<br>a house with my father and brother you<br>can see this is dated a little bit by<br>the color of the beard um things have<br>changed since then um I did the design<br>and then we built the house over a<br>period of 3 months together my enduring<br>memory of that project is not so much<br>the hard physical work that was involved<br>but the planning and organization that<br>was needed uh in order to for that to<br>take place um it's still standing by the<br>way I find working with my hands quite<br>relaxing not because it's not<br>demanding because it is both physically<br>and mentally but it's an alternative it<br>requires a different way of<br>thinking and you see something immediate<br>and tangible for your effort and I've<br>always enjoyed that from an early<br>age my academic Journey however had more<br>shaky<br>Beginnings this is a copy of my grade<br>four report from primary school and it's<br>interesting to look at some of the<br>criteria that were used uh in those days<br>up the top here we have personal habits<br>speech social adjustment games you can<br>see I was very good at<br>games then on this side temperament<br>moral qualities was my lowest<br>score I think Roger may want to<br>re-evaluate my appointment to the ethics<br>uh committee on the basis of this report<br>but it's the it's the text I want to<br>look at um in physical activities the<br>new expression for drill he's a teacher<br>that's really with<br>it John's performance is<br>excellent I wish I could say the same of<br>ability uh here he is just a<br>but like the turtle like the tortoise we<br>arrives so you can't get much clearer<br>than<br>that I took great pleasure about 21<br>years after that teacher wrote that<br>report uh letting her know that I just<br>graduated with my<br>doctorate um and to her credit she was<br>very gracious and and congratulate<br>about<br>that my son is visiting from Perth this<br>week and his presence reminded me um of<br>the day he discovered all my school<br>reports uh it happened to be at a time I<br>was berating him for his lack of<br>performance in school and after he<br>discovered my reports of course he said<br>did<br>that report continued to represent<br>fairly typical academic performance for<br>me uh over a period of time after<br>completing primary school I went to a<br>large secondary school where all the<br>grades were<br>streamed so a was the highest uh grade<br>and it sort of went down after that so I<br>began on top but as I went through the<br>forms you can see<br>developing thank goodness in sixth form<br>I went to another school and it wasn't<br>streamed there was just the one class so<br>I feel as though I ended on a high<br>note but I experienced somewhat of an<br>epiphany when I was in form four and it<br>came in the shape of of this little box<br>which I still have um this was one of my<br>woodwork projects uh which was a class I<br>enjoyed and I I completed my projects<br>quite quickly and uh quite a good<br>standard and I realized that while I was<br>waiting for my classmates to catch up I<br>could actually make a few more so I<br>could make two or three of these in the<br>time that the teacher gave us to do the<br>project so then I could sell them to my<br>classmates and um they we it was it was<br>it was good around they benefited it uh<br>as well and that's when I realized that<br>this so when I finished high school I<br>wanted to do something practical and the<br>idea of teaching had appe for me um so I<br>could pass on the pleasure that I<br>derived from making things so I became<br>what was called then a manual arts<br>teacher this is a typical manual arts<br>class room where the focus of teaching<br>was on skill development through the<br>making of projects the origin of manual<br>arts schools were really an<br>Institutional reaction to to a social<br>issue uh in earlier times uh as a way to<br>get kids off the street and also to<br>satisfy a shortage of of skilled labor<br>uh that were that represented the<br>origins of of the manual arts<br>schools Manual Arts morphed into what<br>was called industrial Arts operating<br>machines became more important the focus<br>was still on skill development but it<br>was skills for industry rather than<br>skills for personal<br>development more recently it was<br>realized that this approach was only<br>relevant for a few students who wanted<br>to pursue that particular type of<br>employment and in a context where<br>Society was becoming more technological<br>iCal there was a need for education to<br>prepare students for that technological<br>aspect of society and hence was<br>developed a learning area that we<br>currently call technology<br>education uh in recognition of the need<br>for people to be technologically<br>literate uh this is a compulsory<br>school uh briefly this is the summary of<br>Technology education uh in the New<br>Zealand curriculum there's three main<br>areas um knowledge about technology<br>nature and understanding of technology<br>and that's achieved through practice so<br>these areas are integrated together and<br>the goal is a<br>broad a broad type of technological<br>students the components of technological<br>literacy<br>uh have a broad understanding of how and<br>why things<br>work understand how technological<br>products and technological systems are<br>developed students can critically<br>evaluate technological developments and<br>Trends and can design and de evaluate<br>their own Solutions in response to needs<br>and opportunities and the notion is that<br>this is achieved in a classroom through<br>practice<br>however as long as I can remember<br>there's been an attitude towards these<br>practically oriented subjects in the<br>school<br>curriculum which I think is a reflection<br>of a broader social divide which<br>separates theory and practice or the<br>academic and the<br>Practical in fact it existed for a long<br>time before I can<br>remember for example the Greek god he<br>faac us was the god of goldsmiths<br>blacksmiths Masons and<br>Carpenters but he was deformed and he<br>was the god of he was the object of the<br>other gods mirth as he hobbled<br>about he was a Divine God and a Smith<br>but he was the only Divinity that was<br>misshapen and subject to the other gods<br>ridicule this was in spite of his almost<br>magical creations uh the throne that<br>could move under its own power<br>impenetrable armor and a bed that could<br>recognize and if necessary trap its<br>occupants so he used this to capture his<br>wife's<br>lover uh maybe there's a patent out<br>there today for<br>some so there's a really longstanding<br>history which privileges thinking above<br>doing more recently and hugely<br>influential in that separation uh were<br>Taylor's Principles of Scientific<br>Management which was published in<br>1915 these were based on his time and<br>motion studies of what the workers<br>did all the traditional knowledge<br>possessed by the workers was gathered<br>and recorded by the managers reduced to<br>specific laws and rules and then passed<br>back to the workers to each perform one<br>specific part of the<br>process his thesis was that all possible<br>brainwork should be removed from the<br>shop and centered in the planning or<br>laying out<br>Department schooled Craftsmen could then<br>be replaced with unchilled workers at a<br>lower cost so the conception of the work<br>was removed from those who did the<br>work knowledge was elevated to a<br>managerial concern rather than something<br>that resided with the<br>workers this of course was epitomized by<br>the introduction of the assembly line by<br>Henry Ford uh in<br>1913 and it was Allied with some broader<br>social changes as well uh related to a<br>New Concept of marketing for example<br>where consumers needed to be encouraged<br>to uh be willing to purchase Mass produc<br>produc products rather than craft<br>produced<br>products and the acceptability of<br>Consumer<br>Debt this had the effect of reducing the<br>need for workers to think about what<br>they<br>do and continue to promulgate the<br>dichotomy between theory and practice<br>and the elevation of theory to the<br>status of a managerial concern rather<br>than something that resided with the<br>workers<br>I think we can see evidence of this<br>today not just in the factory<br>floor um where the capacity for thinking<br>and making judgments has been removed<br>from the<br>professionals standardized testing for<br>example removes a teacher from making<br>intelligent and informed discretionary<br>decisions about student<br>progress a car mechanic working on a<br>light model vehicle is dependent on a<br>computer to decide what the problem is<br>and which part needs<br>replacing so it seems that there's a<br>widely accepted dichotomy between<br>knowledge work and manual work it's seen<br>in many ways that that are related to<br>the school context of this discussion as<br>well for example parents<br>preferences for a professional rather<br>than a trade career for their<br>children a preference for the<br>theoretical subject prerequisites for<br>university courses that are related to<br>technology um School Notions of career<br>guidance if a student isn't very good in<br>the theoretical subjects then often<br>they're put in a practical<br>stream and school timet often<br>disadvantage the needs of practical<br>subjects which require more<br>time a prevalent concept seems seems to<br>be that when you do practical work and<br>use practical knowledge you don't have<br>to think as much or as hard but this is<br>really been contrary to my experience I<br>find manual work very engaging and also<br>quite intellectually CH<br>challenging so my thesis today is that<br>this is a false dichotomy between<br>doing the thesis this thesis is nicely<br>summarized by Rich pring in his book<br>called closing the Gap theory is<br>portrayed as a world of abstractions of<br>deep understanding of the accumulated<br>wisdom set down in books of Liberation<br>from the here and<br>now practice on the other hand is<br>identified with doing rather than<br>thinking with the acquisition of skills<br>rather than knowledge with lowlevel<br>knowledge rather than<br>understanding intelligence knowing how<br>is ignored the practical way to<br>theoretical understanding<br>dismissed the wisdom behind intelligent<br>doing is<br>unrecognized so while there seems to be<br>a social and academic sentiment that<br>privileges Theory over practice there<br>there are many of course who who see no<br>separation for example Mike Rose in his<br>book called the mind at work he<br>demonstrates through research and<br>personal exploration of a variety of<br>workplaces that cognitive ability<br>including perception judgment memory and<br>knowledge is employed daily in the work<br>of laborers like welders and<br>Carpenters he says our Testament to<br>physical work are so often focused on<br>the values that such work exhibits<br>rather than on the thought it<br>requires it's a subtle but pervasive<br>emission it is as though in our cultural<br>iconography we are given the muscled arm<br>the sleeve rolled tight against biceps<br>but no thought bright behind the eye no<br>brain Fuko also proposes that it serves<br>the interest of both theory and practice<br>to see them as being independent<br>integrative or has he terms it mutually<br>constitutive theory is useless without<br>practice it must ultimately be seen as<br>having implications for practice in some<br>way or<br>another and conversely practice cannot<br>or rather should not exist without<br>Theory to practice without Theory would<br>mean that we would could not learn from<br>the past EXP experiences gain Insight<br>from failure or project into the<br>future there are also many Educators who<br>through their research have supported<br>the notion that thinking and doing are<br>inextricably<br>related a couple of examples I have<br>education um this model was developed by<br>the assessment of performance unit at<br>Goldsmith college at the University of<br>London and was based on the examination<br>of 15,000 students 14 to 16 year old<br>students and the conclusion was that<br>students make progress by iterating<br>between thinking and doing so on this<br>model on this side you've got the<br>Imaging and modeling inside the head and<br>then what you do with those ideas um<br>outside the head so a student might<br>begin with some hazy impression<br>um and then as they iterate between<br>thinking and doing that's how progress<br>occurs um potential to more developed<br>Solutions um similar research was done<br>in Canada by Malcolm Welch at Queens<br>University uh he looked at intermediate<br>age children and their development of<br>creative thinking skills and his<br>conclusion was that creativity in<br>students the the ability to think<br>creatively in students develops in<br>series rather than parallel these are<br>terms borrowed from um the movement of<br>electrical currents and the logic here<br>is that often teachers ask students to<br>think of a range of different ideas and<br>then to choose the best idea and here<br>research indicated that that's very very<br>difficult for students to do rather what<br>they can do is begin with an idea and<br>then do something with that idea and<br>that that leads to an an an adjusted<br>idea or a new idea and so on uh progress<br>is made um that<br>way I recently came across a book called<br>shop class as soulcraft by Matthew<br>Crawford in which he recounts some of<br>his working life<br>experiences he gained a PhD in political<br>philosophy from the University of<br>Chicago and then joined a Washington<br>think tank but he soon became dispirited<br>with a sense of<br>uselessness and established a motorbike<br>shop uh in<br>Virginia uh and as he States I quickly<br>realized that there was more thinking<br>going on on in the bike shop than in my<br>previous job in the think<br>tank uh his book elaborates on the deep<br>thinking that's required in doing<br>practical things he generalizes from his<br>case in repairing and restoring old<br>motorbikes to a range of other practical<br>professions I think there's a certain<br>social currency about this idea the<br>recognition of the importance of<br>practice some of you will be familiar<br>with the rise of the maker movement it's<br>like a it's like a Hightech<br>DIY uh if you like um in which people<br>feel the need to be more than just<br>consumers uh people feel the need to<br>create to invent to make things for<br>themselves and it it really is a<br>Grassroots movement that's being<br>established uh in a lot of countries<br>I think the global financial crisis has<br>led to a re-evaluation of the<br>institutions that we<br>trust may be a need to be independent<br>from the Obscure forces of a global<br>economy and the realization that<br>productive labor is the real Foundation<br>Prosperity it wasn't too long ago that<br>the educational catchcry was the need to<br>prepare students for a knowledge economy<br>many of you can remember that it wasn't<br>that long ago um this has given way to a<br>call for the 21st century<br>skills everyone of course has a<br>different idea about what these skills<br>are but the point is that they're skills<br>and not<br>knowledge we also hear a lot in New<br>Zealand about the need for a creative<br>economy man<br>structures that allow the creative<br>potential of all workers to be Unleashed<br>through participatory decisionmaking<br>programs but creativity is something<br>quite different from Freedom it's<br>something that's cultivated through<br>practice it's the application of<br>critical thinking in response to real<br>problem so I believe that practical work<br>is Rich cognitive physically and<br>socially so the question arises then why<br>it continues to be devalued as a<br>component of education and I think<br>there's two main reasons one is that<br>it's difficult to<br>document practical or tacet knowledge as<br>it sometimes referred to does not follow<br>rules nor is it easily formalizable<br>it's difficult to<br>articulate and cannot be represented in<br>a formulaic<br>way intuitive judgments of complex<br>systems especially when made by expert<br>practitioners are richer than can be<br>represented by any set of<br>algorithms our ability to make judgments<br>is holistic in character and arises from<br>con from repeated confrontations with<br>real<br>situations the totality of the situation<br>is grasped all at once in a way that may<br>articulation and if it's difficult to<br>document that also means that it's<br>difficult to<br>assess and the managers of Education<br>don't like things of course that are<br>assess there were two seemingly<br>unrelated events a couple of years ago<br>which provided an opportunity for uh a<br>number of us to respond to these types<br>of<br>issues uh one was in about<br>2010 there was a shakeup of the<br>GCSE um in England the um General the<br>general certificate of secondary<br>education um and it arose because there<br>was no confidence in the coursework<br>component of the award that students got<br>um so the conclusion was made by the<br>minister of education at the time that<br>no no coursework would therefore be be<br>included in the students final grade so<br>there was a return to the traditional uh<br>endof year exam system um this was<br>particularly bad for the Practical<br>related<br>subjects um who were facing just being<br>assessed by a 3-hour uh paper and pencil<br>test at the same time in Western<br>Australia there was a review of the<br>upper secondary<br>curriculum which resulted in a lot more<br>subjects being examined and these were<br>previously UNAM previously unexamined<br>performance-based subjects so there were<br>subjects in the technology areas where<br>students were doing design and making<br>things um subjects in the physical<br>education area which relies heavily on<br>performance subjects in the Arts<br>areas<br>um so it was realized of course by the<br>examining Authority that real time<br>examination of performance is of course<br>very expensive you can't go around the<br>whole state looking at what everybody<br>does and giving them a Mark that way but<br>there was also a recognition of the the<br>inappropriateness of an exam you can't<br>have a 3-hour paper examination which<br>examines performance over a period of<br>time so these two things coming together<br>inspired us to do some research we which<br>had as its<br>aim um to record student practical<br>knowledge on real task for high stakes<br>summative<br>assessment the three key Innovations of<br>This research were um the digital<br>representations of student<br>performance the an online repository<br>which was acceptable to um the markers<br>of that performance and then a<br>particular type of assessment which was<br>enabled to be done because the student<br>work was in digital<br>form so let me explain a little bit<br>about um This research the rationale<br>there for was that student practical<br>knowledge is important in some<br>subjects student performance in many<br>areas is difficult to capture using<br>paper and pen in a three-hour<br>examination um assessment should reflect<br>the nature of the learning because<br>teachers will teach to the summative<br>assessment so despite what the<br>curriculum says if the teachers are<br>aware that the summative assessment is a<br>theoretical examination then that's what<br>they will teach toward um so that was<br>the rationale for the basis of This<br>research uh we did it over three years<br>the first year we tested the ideas that<br>we had about recording student<br>performance in the second year we tested<br>the practicability of the systems that<br>we had designed and in the third year we<br>tested uh the scope avilability to make<br>sure it could be used over a broad area<br>I want to talk we focused on four<br>different subjects but I just want to<br>talk about the year 11 uh engineering<br>course which had 204 students in 20<br>schools so the engineering<br>examination uh was a series of specified<br>activities which takes the students from<br>a design brief to the construction of of<br>a project or a model over a period of 3<br>hours it had to be within 3 hours for<br>the constraints of the uh examining<br>Authority um students had a suggested<br>time frame within which to complete each<br>of the activities they had to progress<br>through within the 3<br>hours so each student worked live online<br>to comp to compile their portfolio<br>within a preformed template so the the<br>examination was a template and the<br>students had to work to that<br>template this particular task we varied<br>it each year but this particular task<br>involved the design and modeling of a<br>system for producing fresh water from<br>seawater so that was the focus of the<br>students<br>task these are some of the pages from<br>the<br>portfolio so this is page one of 19 so<br>there were 19 elements to the<br>examination which they had to progress<br>through uh there was a time for the<br>students to see how they were<br>progressing this was the introduction to<br>the problem and then they had to take uh<br>to enter some initial responses<br>there as they progressed through their<br>portfolio um they could take pictures of<br>what they were doing um they could video<br>record themselves doing it and then<br>upload the video into their<br>portfolio um interestingly we found that<br>when students are able to talk about<br>what they're doing it's a very different<br>message than if they have to write about<br>it so it's it's a lot more um<br>genuine um reflection of student<br>performance ability throughout the exam<br>we provided some stimulus material so<br>they had to progress through the<br>examination they couldn't go back so in<br>the provision of stimulus material like<br>this we were interested in how they<br>could change their thinking how they<br>could change their performance in<br>information uh some students doing their<br>projects here's a student taking<br>pictures of his model um they sketched<br>their ideas this is the first sketch<br>annotated their sketches and then that<br>was uploaded into their uh portfolio<br>examination then at the at the end of<br>the exam they had to think more broadly<br>than the particular project that they<br>were working on and in Western Australia<br>at the time a solar deselenation plant<br>uh was being built um so the students<br>were required to think about some<br>environmental some social and some<br>economic<br>criteria by which to evaluate a large<br>scale um de salination plant so when<br>they finished their exam each aspect of<br>their portfolio was uploaded into a<br>website and this is what it looked like<br>when when they' finished so in this exam<br>there was 14<br>pages um this just goes up to 12 but<br>each page has a range of of<br>representations of performance on it<br>that the assessor can see so a video<br>talking about um initial reactions uh<br>some<br>sketches um some pictures of the model<br>that was being made some annotations of<br>the model uh some more discussion about<br>the students feeling about their work uh<br>and and so on so it was combined into um<br>a port<br>folio and then because it<br>was uh<br>webbased it meant that a new type or a<br>different type of assessment could be<br>used and in this particular case we used<br>a comparative pairs<br>assessment this is whereby an evaluator<br>or a marker will present will be<br>presented with two portfolios side by<br>side on the screen and the assessor just<br>has to make a judgment about which one<br>is<br>best so portfolio a is better or<br>portfolio B is better and if you do that<br>often enough with enough comparisons<br>between student<br>portfolios you get a very reliable rank<br>order of the students in that particular<br>group so we were able to demonstrate in<br>this case that um this form of<br>assessment produces a very reliable<br>outcome so some of the results of the<br>research of course the students really<br>liked the Practical performance being<br>assessed um that's why they do courses<br>like this because they feel an affinity<br>with the practice of those types of<br>courses um the<br>teachers didn't<br>feel um that conflict between the nature<br>of the subject in the examination uh it<br>was in<br>sympathy The Experience more accurately<br>in this case reflected the nature of<br>engineering and what's really nice for<br>the for a researcher is that the<br>researcher actually the research<br>actually made a difference and uh some<br>people are using um these ideas for<br>example the OCR exam board the Cambridge<br>assessments board um are using<br>electronic portfolios to assess<br>performance<br>uh the UK<br>sets that student<br>student I think it's student assessment<br>tasks it's like our um National<br>assessment and uh the government is<br>using uh portfolios for creative writing<br>uh the curriculum Council of Western<br>Australia is now using the system the<br>Israel Ministry of Education and the<br>Sweden uh National assessment a agency<br>are all starting to use um this<br>assessment so it's nice that when you do<br>research someone actually pays attention<br>to<br>it thinking about the New Zealand<br>context there's there's many<br>ncea achievement standards which are<br>practically based uh at the moment<br>there's opportunities for students to<br>submit portfolios to demonstrate their<br>achievement most often they're in paper<br>form uh which is really quite limiting<br>in terms of representing student<br>performance um but um electronic<br>portfolios are becoming more<br>acceptable uh interestingly it was just<br>in the last couple of weeks that the<br>nzqa has established a digital<br>assessment transformation team to look<br>at um digit using digital forms of<br>reliability so in<br>conclusion um my conclusion is that<br>practical knowledge is<br>valuable um theory and practice are<br>mutually<br>dependent assessment drives teacher<br>practice and assessment for practice<br>therefore needs to be<br>smart<br>thank<br>you uh ladies and gentlemen my name is<br>Al glesby I am the proce chancellor of<br>research and I'd like to thank professor<br>John Williams for his talk<br>tonight he said at the beginning he what<br>he spoke about when he was a younger man<br>with his teacher and the teacher hoped<br>that the tus would fin arrive well I<br>think we have news but all us is here<br>because the the message that we've got<br>tonight in this speech is everything you<br>would expect of a master if not a<br>complete professor of a topic because<br>this is something that in our own lives<br>we see the division between theory and<br>practice we see a division a dichotomy<br>or a divide and yet the speech tonight<br>by professor John Williams shows us the<br>importance and the need to challenge<br>this not just on a personal level or an<br>educational level but also a social<br>level now from here we're going to go<br>forward and have a few drinks and a bit<br>more discussion with professor John<br>Williams outside one more time thank<br>you the University of waor where the<br>world is<br>going</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
