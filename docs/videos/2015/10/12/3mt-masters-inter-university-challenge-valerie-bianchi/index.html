font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the Department of Conservation or doc<br>Rangers say that they feel like rock<br>stars and why not they turn up to a<br>school for a classroom visit and they're<br>high-fiving all the students that go<br>past they get to be the expert Ranger in<br>the cool uniform getting kids excited<br>about conservation the students have<br>lots of questions but once the bell<br>rings it's time for the kids to move on<br>to something else research shows that<br>these short types of environmental<br>education experiences are not effective<br>to create enduring outcomes so how then<br>to move forward to get effective<br>education outcomes doc managers believe<br>the best use of Rangers limited time is<br>to emphasize working with teachers<br>rather than students but what does this<br>mean for Rangers working in education<br>for many it represents a significant<br>change my research is aimed at helping<br>duck understand what kind of<br>professional support should be available<br>for some Rangers to make this transition<br>or sustain the effort for others as you<br>can see from the slide my research<br>journey began through analyzing ki dhaak<br>education reports and interviewing<br>education managers these steps helped<br>eliminate how aspirational goals might<br>be achieved and what expectations there<br>are four staff next an essential step in<br>my research will be to serve eight<br>interview Rangers we know that logically<br>many understand the purpose and benefit<br>of working in this way but change is<br>hard prior to my research one Ranger<br>express feelings a little bit nervous<br>about working with adults rather than<br>children who they feel comfortable<br>working with in order to plan<br>appropriate opportunities for staff so<br>they've got the skills they need and the<br>confidence to use them I'll ask Rangers<br>what professional development networking<br>and support they feel might be useful<br>moving forward early findings suggest<br>many Rangers will need help to<br>understand how Western and Mahdi medium<br>conservation fit into the New Zealand<br>curriculum the value of this Reese<br>for doc is clear in order for their<br>staff to do a good job it's important to<br>know what they might need there are also<br>significant benefits to school<br>communities if Rangers are able to<br>support teachers to facilitate with<br>their students it will mean conservation<br>education can succeed at the curricular<br>level this has far-reaching consequences<br>since this education is essential to<br>prepare the next generation of<br>decision-makers we still want to make<br>sure Rangers are rock stars we're by<br>providing them the support they need we<br>can make sure their song is on key thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
