font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>depression is a big problem it affects 1<br>in 7 New Zealanders it costs New Zealand<br>1 billion dollars every year and we lose<br>500 people every year to suicide it's a<br>big problem and we don't really<br>understand it yet what leads to<br>depression why is it that two people can<br>live similar lives but only one of them<br>goes on to become depressed I'm<br>interested in what makes someone<br>vulnerable to developing depression you<br>can see here that this person has less<br>activity over the left frontal part of<br>their brain than the right we call this<br>pattern of brain activity frontal brain<br>asymmetry and it's a well-established<br>marker of depression vulnerability we<br>see this asymmetrical pattern in people<br>who are depressed but we can also see it<br>in people who have never experienced<br>depression before and it tells us that<br>these people are more likely to go on to<br>develop depression in the future but<br>what's going on in these parts of the<br>brain that less activity on the left and<br>more on the right means you're more<br>likely to get depressed we don't know<br>yet and that's what I'm looking at in my<br>research what thinking processes<br>underlying vulnerability we think that<br>these parts of the brain which are<br>called the left and right dorsolateral<br>prefrontal cortex are responsible for<br>ignoring or suppressing information and<br>that the left side is particularly<br>important for ignoring negative things<br>so our theory is if you have less<br>activity over the left maybe you can't<br>ignore negative things very well and so<br>you become more overwhelmed by them and<br>you can see how this might lead to<br>depression but there's nothing yet that<br>test this idea so that's what I'm doing<br>using electrodes I record people's brain<br>activity and I see if they display this<br>vulnerable pattern then I give them a<br>computer task and I tell them to focus<br>on the task and ignore everything else<br>but while they're doing the task I also<br>flash up gory images of mutilated bodies<br>what I look at is whether the people<br>with this vulnerable pattern of activity<br>get particularly distracted by the gory<br>images are they particularly bad at<br>ignoring them if they are then it<br>suggests that one this area of the brain<br>on the left is important for ignoring<br>negative things to having less activity<br>here means you can't ignore the negative<br>things very well and three not being<br>able to ignore negative things may make<br>you more vulnerable to depression this<br>would be great to know because it would<br>reveal an important difference in the<br>way that vulnerable people think but I'm<br>only halfway through collecting my data<br>this research will help us to understand<br>better depression vulnerability better<br>if we can understand what's different<br>about the way a vulnerable person thinks<br>before they get depressed what processes<br>might be going on unnoticed before<br>disaster strikes then we'll be in a<br>stronger position to protect people</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
