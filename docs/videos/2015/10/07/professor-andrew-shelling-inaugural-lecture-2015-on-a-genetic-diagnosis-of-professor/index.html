a Professor.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so good evening pleasure and delight to<br>see such a wonderful turnout and welcome<br>I'm the Dean of techna medical and<br>health sciences John Fraser and it's my<br>great pleasure to welcome you to the<br>third of a series of seven inaugural<br>lectures for 2015 I'll just start by<br>introducing and then we'll have some<br>introductory remarks from Professor<br>Peter stone so inaugural lectures for<br>those of you who are unfamiliar with<br>academia are in fact one of the<br>highlights of academic calendar and as I<br>said before this year we have a record<br>seven new professors and they will be<br>presenting over the coming four weeks so<br>last week we had our first two inaugural<br>lectures and inaugural lectures are a<br>tradition that dates back to medieval<br>times in those days universities were<br>very much just a collection of<br>professors and nothing else they were<br>recruited into an elite Brotherhood they<br>supported each other protected each<br>other they lived in cloistered<br>surroundings array away from the real<br>world answerable only to themselves and<br>to the easy to interests while expecting<br>at the same time to be handsomely<br>remunerated for just being smarter than<br>everyone else I'll leave it to you to<br>decide whether things have changed very<br>much<br>so the inaugural lecture is a tradition<br>that has not changed in universities and<br>these are the public announcement of our<br>new professors inaugural lectures are a<br>means of showcasing our most eminent<br>staff and a celebration of an event that<br>represents familiar pinnacle in one's<br>academic career elevation to the title<br>of professor is not something that has<br>taken lightly in academia the process of<br>selection is long and involved it<br>requires intense scrutiny from<br>international peers within confirm to<br>the University that the individual has<br>reached the level of the professorial<br>and they are in fact an internationally<br>eminent expert in their field thus<br>giving them the license to say anything<br>they like about this subject and the<br>hope that people will believe them<br>inaugural lectures are also a wonderful<br>opportunity to invite colleagues family<br>and friends to the University to learn<br>about the journey that has led to<br>academic success the milestones the<br>decisions even the heartbreaks but most<br>importantly those mentors who persisted<br>along the way tonight it's my great<br>pleasure to introduce our third and olga<br>lecture professor professor Andrew<br>Schilling and I now invite professor<br>peter stone who will provide some<br>introductory remarks thank you it's a<br>particular pleasure to be introducing<br>professor Andrew Schilling to you<br>tonight I've known him for nearly 20<br>years now and his reputation went before<br>him in his abstract about the lecture we<br>are to hear you mentioned that he was a<br>sporadic case of a genetic diagnosis of<br>Professor well let me assure you he is<br>no mutation<br>he began his academic pursuits in what<br>was physical education what we might now<br>perceive that sports medicine and he<br>certainly brought his love of physical<br>activity fitness and wellness to our<br>department and by 1999 he had firmly<br>established a tradition that i could<br>commend to the whole faculty be and that<br>was the tradition of fat dog the<br>fantastic annual triathlon of the<br>department of obstetrics and gynecology<br>now i have here a priceless souvenir<br>from the 1999 event which can be<br>purchased for a suitable price to<br>support Andrews ongoing research however<br>being a little more serious and and<br>removed from physical education to<br>science whilst in Otago and he obtained<br>a PhD being the top student in both<br>physical education and biochemistry<br>after this he was awarded a prestigious<br>nuffield medical fellowship and he spent<br>three years in oxford at the institute<br>of molecular medicine now in 1996 the<br>department of obstetrics and gynecology<br>in this university was looking to<br>strengthen and reinvigorate its<br>reproductive science teaching and<br>research program and andrew was the<br>logical choice to be appointed as a<br>lecturer this position allowed him to<br>establish his own laboratory and develop<br>his interests which included the<br>genetics of reproductive cancers in 1999<br>he became a senior lecturer I was<br>appointed head of department soon after<br>that in from 2001 to 2013 andrew was<br>deputy head of department and we had a<br>very successful partnership which<br>enabled the department to be strong and<br>both clinical academic and basic science<br>teaching and research during that time I<br>was delighted to be able to support<br>Andrews promotion to associate professor<br>in 2006<br>and along with Professor leasing the<br>coward who is unable to be here tonight<br>we also saw his promotion to Professor<br>this year andrew has contributed to the<br>advancement of reproductive science not<br>only in the department and in the<br>faculty but vary widely he has been<br>president of the New Zealand branch or<br>the Human Genetics Society of<br>Australasia the deputy chair of the<br>Advisory Committee for assisted<br>reproductive technologies a very<br>important position discuss the ethics<br>around all the in vitro fertilization<br>that we do in addition to being on<br>medical many editorial boards and<br>international societies as well as<br>having an impressive publication record<br>in the 33 page cv single spacing<br>professor shilling is currently the<br>associate dean of research and the<br>faculty the associate dean of the<br>performance based research funding the<br>important process by which our<br>university research is recognized in<br>impart funded he's also the director of<br>The Bachelor of medical science honors<br>program which is so important in<br>encouraging young trainee doctors to<br>gain research and science experience and<br>consider a clinical academic career and<br>just recently he initiated the<br>partnership with the Auckland District<br>Health Board turned the Auckland<br>academic Health Alliance which just last<br>week announced its first awards this<br>will build collaboratively on the<br>strength for both this university and<br>our neighbor the major hospital in New<br>Zealand when I was born the double helix<br>had not been discovered Andrew tells me<br>that by his birth we knew what a<br>chromosome was but now we are to hear<br>how professor sheering has brought us to<br>2015 and he has sequenced the<br>professorial genome the first is young<br>thank you Peter not sure came along to<br>the right talk if talking about that<br>person thank you very much for coming<br>but overwhelmed by the number of people<br>here and it's a privilege that you can<br>all come along and hear what I've got to<br>say about myself if you here for the<br>science there might be Nick's weeks talk<br>because I'm going to talk more about<br>myself and the journey that I've been on<br>than about the research they've done<br>although i'm going to add a little bit<br>of research along the way this is paid<br>and i think a lot of us and the faculty<br>really gets where we are by the amazing<br>support that we get from our head of<br>departments and head of schools and our<br>dean so pete has been a great support to<br>me over the years a great team together<br>and more recently with Leslie Macau and<br>who can't be here tonight there are many<br>in the Deanery I want to thank I<br>understand that I've got the most people<br>coming along to the to the inaugural<br>talk so I've been keeping a close eye on<br>that being a little bit competitive but<br>this until I discovered that most of the<br>invites were from that was most people<br>responding the invites was Mike Barrow<br>he cc'd he seems to have responded more<br>than once we've got a great team in the<br>Deanery so thanks to Trevor and mark and<br>karen lee can't be here in pepperoni and<br>pre deceases ross who's here tonight and<br>also I can't say prior to my time in the<br>role of social Dean research I had a<br>great predecessor Louise Nicholson who<br>was a great big schuster to steepen too<br>but she helped me get sit up and been a<br>great mentor along the way thanks also<br>to John for having the faith in me two<br>and half years ago I got an email please<br>go and see the Dean<br>and I wasn't sure what I had done and I<br>was informed that was the day after he<br>got back from a trip from Europe and I<br>was a half an arrow appointment and I<br>knew that I was either in serious<br>trouble or he was going to ask me to do<br>something and doubtless so thank you for<br>the vote of confidence and asking me to<br>be associate dean research and Ian Reed<br>for all his wisdom and knowledge and<br>also salami does but of the same thing<br>as well but I just want to thank Joe<br>wherever she is Josie Thea and I think<br>Joe if she was given a PhD could run the<br>place better than I could so chose me a<br>great ass support over the years we've<br>got a great team and the faculty secure<br>us here tarik can't make it tonight but<br>we call ourselves the grant Buster's who<br>you're going to call because a lot of<br>people in the faculty want to know who<br>the best point of contact is also well<br>supported by research office grateful<br>for Tracy to be here and we've got<br>Lauren and Ruth who support us from<br>research office and of course Jane<br>Harding whose attention to detail is<br>second to none I would also like to<br>thank my mum and my family who are here<br>mum's both my biggest supporter and my<br>biggest critic she she gives me advice<br>on how I should do things and giving<br>talks and doing research so I'm very<br>grateful that she's been able to make it<br>up here from Nelson she's 19th birthday<br>this year coming so it's a she's she's a<br>tough old lady and a lot of respect for<br>her I've also got my little brother here<br>he was born 14 months after me and I<br>quickly realized he was probably a bit<br>bigger and stronger and smarter than me<br>so the only way I could sort of get<br>ahead of him was we need about three<br>years old now as for i found an ex and<br>chopped his fingers off<br>so that put me on a hit of the game for<br>a few years but the surgeons seem to be<br>able to sew them on fairly well but I<br>think a lot of us at that I guess an<br>academic sweet phul for the support team<br>at home and I'm especially grateful to<br>my family so my wife Gretchen who's<br>always been there supporting what I'm<br>doing here mother Janice who's here as<br>well and my two kids who are mentioned<br>briefly a little bit later on the top<br>but it's always great to have support<br>from your family and there's another<br>addition to the family you've got<br>midlands my daughter medal and this has<br>got engaged to james and so great to<br>have them as part of the family so what<br>i'm going to do tonight it's just give<br>you a little bit of a background to who<br>i am and where I came from and then talk<br>about my time at a tiger in Oxford<br>they're going to talk a little bit about<br>life in Auckland and a few other bits<br>and pieces along the way I'm going to<br>struggle to keep the time but I'm sure<br>if I start people see people leaving my<br>timers up so I'm from Nielsen sunny<br>Nelson as a seventh of a family of eight<br>so we lived out in the countryside had a<br>great outdoors life so here's me as a<br>little baby so apart from overcoming<br>being very handsome I also had a deal I<br>was also very active and by nine months<br>as was running around and seemed to like<br>I was I was brought up in a pair of<br>Nielsen called hope so I always many<br>people say where you're from I wishes to<br>say I live in hope you know I didn't get<br>the joke for many years so hope school<br>had a population of 28 students and two<br>classes it was a country school and<br>things were fairly basic but of course<br>at pad at a time of museum we all got a<br>really good education which I'm grateful<br>for you may not be able to read this but<br>Andrew shows promise and outdoor<br>activities seem to be the only common<br>feature of most my reports and certainly<br>that the the max and in grades and<br>really Mitch always mobility I went to<br>Waimea college we I learnt many useful<br>things but the thing that I discovered I<br>was really good at and was a point of<br>difference and something that I guess<br>gave me a lot of confidence was I<br>discovered I was good at running and so<br>sport became my I guess my predominant<br>occupation that time and it was I guess<br>I got a lot of pleasure out of it and<br>also a lot of success and I won't go<br>into too much detail but I I broke all<br>the school records at the time I think<br>they still stand 30 years later when i<br>was 15 i won the wellington under-16<br>cross country and made the the<br>wellington and 18 cross country team for<br>the next 15 years I represented<br>Wellington Otago and in Desmond at<br>different times in cross country and<br>running erode running and athletics<br>which he made it to the world mountain<br>racing championships a few years later<br>in a place called gap and france and i<br>think was just a very simple thing you<br>had to start at the bottom of the mount<br>and make your way up to the top and down<br>the game and that was that was the day<br>and it was I guess the pinnacle of my<br>sort of athletic ambitions but I did<br>note that i was by far the biggest in<br>the most heaviest and in the running<br>which did show that my phenotype wasn't<br>quite right for Pepsi event the other<br>thing I noted is that in the race all<br>behind me we were orange singlets which<br>are the Dutch team so even though I've<br>got Dutch blood the Dutch don't have any<br>mountains so again it shows that<br>phenotype can can win over genotype<br>growing up in Nielsen was a lot of fun<br>it's a mainland the South Island I lived<br>a lot on the outdoors fishing and<br>wearing I think they Daisy Duke shorts I<br>think there might be a few things happen<br>along the way that I probably don't to<br>talk about too much and it climbed a few<br>mountains had a few adventures but I was<br>very fortunate to have a family that<br>that really very old fashioned<br>conservative and traditional but they<br>supported me really well they had never<br>really understood University probably<br>too much he understood how to work hard<br>work ethic and was very pleased when I<br>picked up my first paycheck i think was<br>he died about 12 years ago from cancer I<br>assumed that by working and can't say<br>you were immune to the disease but it<br>doesn't appear to be the case so mom and<br>dad supported us really well basic basic<br>principles like honesty and hard work in<br>a Christian faith as well as always been<br>something that supported me mum and dad<br>tried to overcome the fertility Rite New<br>Zealand<br>and so I was used to a very large family<br>so was always fun to have lots of kids<br>running around so it as as Peter already<br>mentioned i went to a tiger University I<br>was good at sport that's the only reason<br>I went to university and the degree i<br>did was physical education for Zetas<br>were supposed to have three stripes and<br>IQ of 50 was at what they were and the<br>first year wasn't very Stella and I<br>struggled for a little while and you can<br>see that I run cause was incomplete and<br>that was I passed the gymnastics part<br>but I failed the social dance so I<br>hedrick there was one of the when the<br>courses I had to repeat along the way I<br>managed to settle down a bit and and<br>when the pedo makin Tosh prize which is<br>the top student physical education and<br>sort of took a little while to get the<br>hang of study and but after a few years<br>everything turned out okay things went<br>so well that I just that I was convinced<br>to do biochemistry I was very interested<br>in metabolism and such AG acid cycles<br>and things like that and I carried on<br>biochemistry but couldn't get a project<br>in the area those interested in I didn't<br>honors and the only available project<br>was on genetics and looking at<br>integration of viruses so for some my<br>students that are here this is hand<br>written down the bottom here and if<br>David Jenkins was here he'd probably<br>faint because that's something nasty and<br>toxic that I spoke to her in the lab my<br>honors went like a dream everything I<br>did turn to gold and I assumed that<br>science was always like that and I these<br>are some of the first southern blots<br>that we ever done in New Zealand and I<br>know my family's here but are each of<br>those bands represents a piece of DNA<br>that has been made glowing by<br>radioactivity at the time and so people<br>used to come and see how I what I was<br>doing as part of my honours degree and<br>this was actually looking at some human<br>cells each of those lines over here it's<br>a virus it's inserted itself into a<br>piece of<br>DNA so it just seems so natural that<br>doing well and biochemistry and and that<br>was at the time was the top postgraduate<br>department in New Zealand so to get top<br>of that class I assumed that I the road<br>ahead for research was just glowing I<br>had a fantastic mentor move Smith was<br>was a man that I deeply respect and was<br>very supportive of my academic career so<br>everything was going along at that point<br>reasonably okay but the first two years<br>of my PhD were a complete disaster<br>nothing worked and I was wondering where<br>the magic had gone and then just as<br>things started to get better I went into<br>the library and opened up a journal and<br>saw not just not what I was doing but<br>exactly what i was doing in the journal<br>called the Proceedings of the National<br>Academy of Sciences USA so this is one<br>of our top top line journals I was<br>absolutely devastated because after<br>three years of struggle suddenly my<br>exact project was there in print and I<br>guess it was a moment of enlightenment<br>for me I decide what I was going to do<br>either I was going to quit I was going<br>to change topic or I was going to carry<br>on and fight and I guess that was a good<br>kick up the pants for me because<br>everything to that and life at that<br>point had been relatively<br>straightforward and always seem to be<br>able to get what I wanted so what we did<br>as we say we would fight and we would do<br>something a little bit different and<br>carry on so my PhD probably took a<br>little bit longer than it should have a<br>mum and dad a little bit horrified about<br>how long they've been at University we<br>were able to we're able to publish what<br>we did in the end and the publication<br>was was well recognized as something<br>that added something considerably to the<br>field and and help me with the next<br>stages in life this is not a firing<br>squad<br>something about then happened as well so<br>that's 29 years ago in a bit so this is<br>me lined up here and my little brother<br>over here and so rich and I were married<br>as students I guess would break the norm<br>people wait until their bit older to get<br>married and but we decided we'd get<br>married when we were young so Gretchen's<br>always been a supporter right through my<br>career and has always been there to look<br>after me I guess I don't know whether<br>this is true or not but towards the end<br>of my PhD I decided that looking at the<br>next stage in my life my head of<br>department and my supervisor both got at<br>the University of Oxford and I'd always<br>seen it as being the leading light for<br>research and academia about the time<br>this Oxford enough of medical fellowship<br>advertisement came around and I went on<br>whether I might have a chance of that it<br>was designed for medical students rather<br>than science students and they know site<br>students really had it throughout for a<br>number of years so applied and was<br>pleasantly surprised to get an interview<br>flew up to auckland from dunedin and had<br>an interview the other person was a<br>medical student and apparently thought<br>she had it all covered because i was<br>only a scientist after all but actually<br>i think she made one little mistake she<br>turned up in a party frock and said do<br>you mind if I go first I've got a party<br>to go straight after this interview and<br>so perhaps it wasn't the best appearance<br>and so I interview came was probably one<br>of the second to a professorial it's<br>probably the second most stressful thing<br>of my life and I surrounded by all these<br>very important people that told me how<br>the Knuffle Philip fellows always been<br>on to do amazing things and later life<br>and they they did this into that and how<br>much fun honor was to get this award it<br>was a little bit ironic that about 25<br>years later I'm now on the other side of<br>the table doing the same thing so<br>perhaps they could have been right in<br>the end I'm actually wearing enough<br>yield tie so these are awarded<br>either year every two years to one<br>Australian one New Zealand and one South<br>African and William Morris he's his lord<br>nuffield didn't have any children and<br>donated all his money to medical<br>research because Australia said that the<br>New Zealand bought Morris motorcars<br>Canada didn't we get the awards so I had<br>three years in Oxford there are great<br>years went to the Institute of Molecular<br>Medicine the heat of that was at the<br>time was David weatherall fantastic<br>place research resources around limited<br>and at the time of my life I probably<br>work too hard but a bit when you ordered<br>a prestigious fellowship well that you<br>feel like you you've got a duty to<br>somebody I don't know who to actually do<br>your best and do well wetherill also got<br>me a teaching position at christ church<br>college the potential was just be a<br>postdoc and not doing have any<br>attachment to the University at all that<br>was a great experience some of you might<br>know this hallway from Harry Potter and<br>it was it was a great place to be and<br>teach students probably the most fun<br>experience and I could talk for a little<br>bit about this was a somebody convinced<br>me to play rugby he figured out as a new<br>zealand there so i must know what to do<br>with an oval-shaped ball i hadn't played<br>rugby it for years I've been sort of<br>been more interesting running and<br>suddenly discovered I was on the team<br>surrounded by much bigger chips from<br>many from Harrow and eaten and they<br>couldn't work out what social position I<br>was based on my accents of Coursera so<br>they just accepted me quite happily it<br>turned out they were quite good and we<br>actually won the the college rugby<br>competition and the second year that I<br>was on the team and so this is the this<br>is the dinner that we had lots of good<br>food and wine and then with that night<br>we went out around all the colleges<br>singing our college rugby song to all<br>our colleges we'd beaten and<br>and usually a volley a little bit of<br>beer along the way the interesting thing<br>was that the bishop of Oxford joined us<br>and our last bit of the evening was<br>doing a hacker on the steps of the<br>ashmolean museum with the bishop of<br>Oxford down below I did did some work in<br>Oxford my project was a genetic analysis<br>of a varying cancer and I worked very<br>hard 12 publications from my three years<br>in Oxford oh it's what a little bit of<br>science on here these are slides from I<br>guess 25 25 years ago just to highlight<br>that a varian cancer that I was working<br>on was no different to any other type of<br>cancer in terms of survival if you pick<br>up the cancer earlier if it's localized<br>or early stage then most people survive<br>from a ver from all types of cancer and<br>ovarian cancer is no different<br>misdiagnosed late and I saw Ben Lawrence<br>earlier so he knows what I'm talking<br>about diagnosed late then the outcome is<br>very poor the difference with ovarian<br>cancer is that most of it is diagnosed<br>at a very late stage and the slide is<br>probably fairly true 25 years after I<br>made it varun cancer still diagnosed<br>late because there's no early stages are<br>all signs or symptoms whereas breast<br>cancer endometrial cancer catch the<br>cervix often picked up a lot earlier so<br>the reason that ovarian cancer is often<br>called the silent killer is because most<br>woman will present late when the outcome<br>is very poor it was had better ways of<br>detecting ovarian cancer we could pick<br>it up earlier and have better outcomes<br>so what so we did some very exciting<br>work while we're there and publishing<br>and journals like The Lancet and the<br>British Medical Journal but my true<br>focus was on chromosome 6 and I just<br>want to go through some of the things we<br>did back in the old days just move my<br>students sake than anybody else so this<br>is a picture of chromosome 6 and I'd<br>sorted it in a centrifuge and then<br>labeled up with a fluorescent dye and<br>then then labeled it back on to all<br>these chromosomes<br>but what I was most interested in is<br>this is chromosome 6 one of our<br>chromosomes there was a little bit down<br>the bottom that know the half of all of<br>Aaron tumors was lost so the little<br>piece of DNA somewhere down the bottom<br>of chromosome was like six was lost and<br>I found many tumors where there was a<br>little chunk missing right down the very<br>bottom so that we took that to mean it<br>must be kept out holding it an important<br>cancer gene so what we did is got a<br>whole lot of normal chromosomes so<br>here's normal chromosome 6 hits it's a<br>as mate over here and we've made a<br>little glass pipette and we cut the end<br>off chromosome 6 and put them in a test<br>tube and collected them all up and I had<br>to go to London for a week to get enough<br>bits of chromosome 6 to be able to am to<br>work with them further so my students in<br>the room this is a gel with markers that<br>you can clearly see to it Jill run<br>properly so what each of those little<br>little spots on this on this what's<br>called an agarose gel as a piece of DNA<br>from that region of chromosome 6 that<br>I'd carefully cut off from the<br>chromosome so I had thousands of copies<br>of those and then what we did is we<br>sequence them on these special plates<br>called sequencing gels and we just have<br>to read them so this is TTT see tttt GCT<br>a write them down a little book and then<br>enter them into a computer and so if I<br>was lucky I could do a few thousand<br>nucleotides in it in a day and working<br>hard I could get a little bit of<br>chromosome 6 working that sequence and<br>analyze now the interesting thing is i<br>could probably said what had done in<br>three years in oxford i could probably<br>do in an afternoon now with the human<br>genome project on tip so what was a fan<br>work and interesting its technology and<br>things have moved very quickly something<br>else happen in Oxford so although I'm<br>electorate and reproductive science we<br>decided we weren't going to have any<br>children just thin and<br>nine months later Medellin appeared and<br>change their life forever as I spent to<br>come back I've thinking about what I was<br>going to do next and I wrote an article<br>that to be publishing that in the museum<br>medical journal and much all you weren't<br>better heed that it's going to blow up a<br>little pieces I was rejected and I was<br>very disappointed and the little bit was<br>that the article starts off reasonably<br>enough but I think that anyone with<br>about a specialist molecular medicine<br>would soon be lost in the complexities<br>of tumorigenesis in other words it would<br>be over the head but all but a handful<br>of our readers so this was my rejection<br>letter from some research that out some<br>a review that I wrote and this is from<br>again from just over 20 years ago<br>whereas talking about a cancer patient<br>the best way of getting a better<br>clinical outcome was two things talking<br>about things like early diagnosis<br>rational drug design gene therapy which<br>was one of my PhD and what the whole<br>point of the side was that by<br>understanding the molecular biology and<br>genetics we might have better predictors<br>of treatment no I think I could so use<br>the slide in a talk that you know I<br>could give today and the other thing I<br>talked about was that perhaps each tumor<br>would be different for each patient and<br>they require a different treatment<br>regime so depending on the genetic<br>defects in each the tumors we might have<br>a different way of diagnosing cancer and<br>so this is very modern thinking well<br>that was very modern thinking for the<br>day and as now the Norman and people<br>like being Lawrence and Chris print of<br>course talk about this thing all the<br>time but it was it was increasingly see<br>the new zealand medical journal didn't<br>think that was with a bear assaults in<br>the end so i became a lecturer and there<br>are in reproductive science National<br>Women's Hospital surrounded by its<br>excellent people including airmont<br>ligands and first head of department was<br>Gillian tuna and john france who were<br>both great supporters and head of<br>departments our head larry just down the<br>hallway Larry and I been good friends<br>for years to in order to recruit<br>teresa ourselves up a little bit so this<br>this was just to show that what sort of<br>students we wanted to attract some work<br>at our laboratories so Larry and I have<br>worked together on a number of projects<br>over the years and has been a great<br>colleague and work mate over the years<br>had many excellent students and Debbie<br>Prendergast worked in the lab my lab for<br>many years we've got Anita here tonight<br>and DB obviously in a few dinosaurs I'm<br>not quite sure and so many students over<br>the years that have really added<br>excitement and spice to the research<br>life so I want to talk about a few<br>students in particular its own pretty so<br>Chris print has been also a wonderful<br>colleague Chris is actually a bit of a<br>pain before he turned up all the<br>students thought I was wonderful always<br>you know I do things on time and I've<br>read their the papers and whatever and<br>get it back to them but Chris they said<br>why can't you get them back as fast as<br>crystals wait why can't you emailed me<br>at three o'clock in the morning and get<br>it done the next day chris is such a<br>wonderful guy and so hardworking and<br>much more intelligent me so you can hear<br>from him next week he can't make it<br>tonight every seen his apologies we've<br>also also had another new arrival which<br>is Lindsay Lindsay is really spice up<br>the Larry of my life she's been she's<br>been a great colleague and she needs to<br>be congratulated from for teaching<br>reproduction and taking the practical as<br>now have many students over the years so<br>you might notice that most of email and<br>very attractive so here's angel and we<br>were course the Great Wall of China so<br>agent I had a great trip there this is a<br>rose n we're in and in Spain what you<br>might notice that the students some<br>little bit of an appropriate pet em<br>Pepsi and perhaps a little bit too cozy<br>but mohandas never going to heaven so so<br>so Mohan is one of the few y chromosomes<br>ahead he's actually got too much he's<br>actually got a major problem and I<br>looked in the statutes the other day and<br>I don't if you could read down the<br>so so these the faculty results from<br>that around the bays run you can see<br>that he's at HC two and a half minutes<br>behind a supervisor so it's unlikely<br>he's going to be awarded as a PhD but<br>maybe next year Mohan now I'd split up<br>the slide 2 i'm going to talk a little<br>bit of science for about 10 minutes and<br>then finish with a little bit about what<br>other things i do in my life my biggest<br>problem is lack of focus my will<br>consists of genetics cancer and<br>reproduction I've just thought I would<br>just note down the different areas that<br>I'm involved and a lot of people in the<br>room and some people in the room I I<br>noticed before they aren't even on these<br>lists and so it's a little bit<br>embarrassing but event I guess many of<br>us should learn to focus in life and<br>I've always dabbled in too many things<br>is very hard to keep up to date with<br>everything but if they had many great<br>projects and relationships with people<br>in the faculty and of course many<br>students over the years was it good go<br>through a little bit of a little bit of<br>research and just highlight some of the<br>things that I do in life so this is the<br>slide that I show every student that I<br>teach proves nodding ahead that that all<br>human disease is a mixture of genetics<br>and environmental factors some things<br>are purely genetic like Huntington's<br>disease and he wrote of breast cancer<br>there the other end some things are<br>purely environmental perhaps cigarette<br>smoking and lung cancer as an example of<br>that however even lung cancer and<br>cigarette smoking as Rob's up the back<br>that there is a junior component of that<br>as well so underlying every human<br>disease as my mantra there's a little<br>bit of genetics and environment but of<br>course it's the interaction of the two<br>that brings about disease occurring<br>since the family that I studied many<br>years ago and what you can see is a<br>varian cancer occurs and nearly every<br>generation that family so this is a<br>pedigree that so the the oldest people<br>at the top the youngest one at the<br>bottom nearly every person and that<br>family had ovarian cancer often the<br>younger age than they should and of<br>course this is a perfect example of a<br>cancer syndrome and this family from<br>Emory was that was a brca1 mutation<br>which we found so want to talk about one<br>project that came about something<br>especially the associate in research and<br>we're talking about sort of plan<br>research and that sort of thing well a<br>clinician Neil Johnson came to see me<br>one day he knew that I worked on over in<br>cancer he said I've had this funny<br>family come and see me the young woman<br>came to the clinic with her mother and<br>with hitter periods had stopped at age<br>31 her mother said well the same thing<br>happened to me my period stopped quite<br>early and something happened to my<br>identical twin and I'm sorry nan<br>identical twin sister over here and also<br>something strange happened to<br>grandmother about about the same age and<br>your cousins were also unusual there was<br>the first time the woman it even it was<br>aware of that that problem running in<br>the family so when something runs in the<br>family like that to me often might mean<br>that there's a gene that's running<br>through that family so I put that to one<br>side and the in the very next day we got<br>an email saying anybody interested in a<br>project on menopause please write to the<br>bread company Bergen because they were<br>launching and you saw Inland Sea bread<br>for menopausal woman and so every for<br>every ten cents that you spent on the<br>bread would go to research project and<br>so the two things happen an interesting<br>family the breeder sponsorship appearing<br>so I applied for that project grant and<br>got it for ten thousand dollars and<br>started off a whole new life of research<br>we went on to find a large number of<br>genes that were that were presently<br>these families about go to these in any<br>detail but you can see some familiar<br>names and here including us Cindy far<br>close in the audience we found that this<br>gene called inhibin was involved we<br>found another gene called Fox l2 was<br>also involved and some of these families<br>will be sore cancer running throughout<br>the families<br>the other thing I did is that when I<br>first made contact a lot of the woman<br>that want to be part of the project it<br>was before the days the internet and<br>they would tell me their life stories<br>and want to know if they were a freak<br>will the only person like that in New<br>Zealand and so as I click today are<br>these women for my research project<br>realize it as an enormous need out there<br>for good information so i used to email<br>them to them or post them and write to<br>them and we set up a little support<br>group initially had meetings together<br>with a woman felt that meeting somebody<br>else is the same condition actually<br>change their lives completely nowadays<br>of course has become a support group<br>online we don't meet to give x-wing do<br>it virtually and women and now accessing<br>information it's really really valuable<br>so for a non clinician to be actually do<br>something useful for woman and the<br>condition has been enormous highlight of<br>my research career we also work on a<br>varian cancer a lot of my early<br>researchers that was on the more common<br>iveth ely all cancers but again we got<br>sidetracked to a project where a couple<br>came to them to see me saying they had a<br>rare type of hearing cancer there's very<br>little research on that topic would I be<br>interested they were raising money by<br>doing fun rounds and things will I be<br>interested in looking at that particular<br>rare tumor called a granulosa cell tumor<br>there are two forms of this an adult<br>type and a juvenile type their lock<br>formers tends to be an older woman and<br>the juvenile teens me and younger woman<br>although there's a lot of overlap in the<br>middle so it's very dangerous to study a<br>rare tumor New Zealand because funding<br>is always difficult however they were<br>able to provide a few thousand dollars<br>every year which made the research<br>office we have a tracy Swift us not very<br>happy with me because these little<br>little grouts would would dribble in<br>what we were able to do is because as a<br>rare tumor we clicked 'add a number of<br>historic tumor blocks for month x<br>paraffin-embedded tissue are we a little<br>bit of tumor inside them and were able<br>to look at certain different genes this<br>one we're looking at in this study here<br>was called Fox l2 which you might not<br>have noticed was involved in premature<br>ovarian failure as well as over in<br>cancer<br>so we were able to publish our findings<br>on this just very recently and we now<br>one of the leading labs and this rare<br>type of cancer although it's becoming<br>increasingly difficult to fund we made<br>the observation that the single gene<br>called Fox l2 caused both premature<br>ovarian failure which is the cells<br>around the follicles not growing very<br>well and also it's a mutation and in the<br>same gene also called a tumor where the<br>cells are growing out of control we<br>actually don't understand how this can<br>happen same mutation causes infertility<br>and lack of cells to grow in a almost<br>identical mutation caused the tumors to<br>grow out of control it's probably<br>because the germline mutation the<br>mutation that you're born with and is<br>probably in the cells right the very<br>beginning causes the abnormality of<br>premature in failure this has happens<br>later on in life it may be the cells are<br>already growing and growing out of<br>control although we don't know the<br>answer that and fortunately I've got a<br>great student called angel again who's<br>looking at this and she's also trying to<br>find better prognostic differences<br>between the adult form the juvenile form<br>and she's looking at some very<br>interesting molecules called micro RNAs<br>that seem to be different between the<br>adult and the juvenile she's also got a<br>funny thing for dragons and like to pit<br>them as well I'm also well known for all<br>students for talking about infertility<br>so my job in first year is the skill<br>that here all the female students and<br>their having children early what I talk<br>about is that there are a number of<br>women I only have a limited number of<br>follicles from life when they're born<br>right through to an to menopause the<br>decline in fertility and the twit and<br>the 20s most students will know the<br>magic age is 24 as the best age to have<br>a baby after the age of 30 we see a<br>decline and then a more rapid decline<br>most woman can't guarantee they have<br>children over the age of 40 I had a<br>medical student a few years ago called<br>Nathaniel who came to ask me about a<br>project and I just read the publication<br>so why don't you copy what the these<br>these people have done and study some of<br>our own students and see what medical<br>university students understand about<br>fertility so he had a Twitter question<br>questionnaire he surveyed 683 students<br>around the University something allowed<br>to do anymore not quite sure why about<br>estimator chance of a woman becoming<br>pregnant if she has intercourse with the<br>fertile male it's the second mission was<br>to make that the likelihood of woman<br>using technology to have a baby and what<br>he showed was that this is what the<br>literature will show that as a woman<br>gets older the likelihood of having a<br>baby declines and all of our students<br>overestimated by about ten or twenty<br>percent at every stage and life about<br>how futile they might be if they use<br>technology and what you can see is that<br>OH even with technology as women get<br>older the technology doesn't work and<br>our students completely overestimate how<br>so I think the main the main outcomes of<br>that study is that most students can<br>identify that tility declines and woman<br>but students completely overestimate<br>their fertility rates and most them<br>overestimate the use of assisted<br>reproductive technologies the medical<br>students were the worst for the use of<br>technology and the nurses also was some<br>early poor at being able to work this<br>out the only students that seemed to do<br>okay with this are the ones that have<br>okay so we also have another very<br>exciting project involved with with<br>leslie and john thompson mohan and this<br>also involves our clear wall indeed<br>Mitchell we're looking at a study that<br>Lisa's been involved with we've got<br>1,200 this is I tried to summarize<br>Mohan's thesis in one slide so I've<br>taken a few liberties what we had is<br>1200 six-year-old children we had<br>information about the mum and all<br>through her pregnancy got information<br>about the dead we're able to extract DNA<br>from the children and have their DNA<br>available we also had understanding of<br>their diet and the exercise and sleep<br>what we try to do is work out which of<br>these contributed most to the obesity of<br>six-year-old children so Mohan swimming<br>in the sea of data at the moment one of<br>the interesting things we did has just<br>compared BMI which is a common Enda sea<br>of obesity and also we were able to<br>measure the percentage body fat we see<br>there's not a perfect relationship<br>between the two but in general it's if<br>you have a high body fat you also have a<br>high BMI we looked at the genetics of<br>both of these processes he realized that<br>there a number of genes were<br>significantly associated with both the<br>percentage body fat and BMI but not much<br>overlap between the two so probably<br>we're looking at when we're looking at<br>obesity we're looking at a range of<br>different earth jr. markers that may be<br>influencing the outcome of these and<br>only a little bit of overlap in the<br>middle mo hands got got a few years<br>where I work lifter to come up with a<br>real solution to obesity in New Zealand<br>another interesting snippet I just want<br>to talk about is it in in breast cancer<br>one of the most significant successes<br>over the last 23 years if a woman has<br>Eastern receptor staining and breast<br>tissue then she's likely to receive<br>chemotherapy if she has one percent or<br>more she's likely to receive and<br>slightly more modern in decline<br>therapies like tamoxifen or aremetis<br>inhibitors so the cutoff is made between<br>court and one percent so if you've got<br>no stoning you get chemotherapy if you<br>get one percent or more then you can<br>have in decline therapy but we know that<br>the sailing is not is not bimodal and<br>then it's there's a intensity is as<br>linear and what Anita in my lab who's<br>been the longest dais and deserves a<br>medal for perseverance and and and cause<br>the the brain power behind it as Chris<br>what we realize that woman that I<br>er-positive here and we will measure the<br>this is measuring the amount of each and<br>receptor there's present in each of<br>their tumors this is an close to a<br>thousand tumors there's that there's a<br>linear representation long here so some<br>woman will have very low levels of asian<br>receptor even though their diagnosis the<br>AB positive and even so some woman that<br>called er- someone will have high levels<br>of each and receptor expression and<br>their tumors and we know that about<br>thirty percent of woman don't respond to<br>act to in decrying through peas and some<br>woman become resistant so we sometimes<br>wonder from some of this work whether or<br>not we can make a better diagnosis on a<br>mixture of pathology and more molecular<br>more modern molecular genetics so that's<br>just a little last spice of what we do<br>in the research lab I just want to talk<br>about one other piece of research in the<br>last 5-10 minutes a bit there I've been<br>involved with this is Peter Shepherd or<br>if your Minister Joyce ship whose runs<br>at queens and research week one thing<br>that didn't go into my promotion<br>application is my contribution to a<br>field of research called fascia nomics<br>so this is a this is a competition down<br>on queens down where by researchers get<br>to dress up and clothing from the<br>laboratory in what happened a few years<br>ago is that they decided they needed<br>another night foot for for another yet<br>another dinner for Lee important<br>speakers will cancel the fashion<br>competition and I say that's not fear<br>the students just love it so Peter said<br>well I'm in charge if that's the case so<br>I thought I couldn't be in charge of a<br>novena fight she didn't compete in it as<br>well so<br>whole point of fascia nomics is that<br>you've got to scan the laboratory find<br>some equipment and produce a garment<br>find somebody brave representable to<br>actually model the above item<br>alternately just tell your supervisor<br>that you'll quit at least they don't do<br>it and then you come up with a<br>commentary so over the years of<br>embarrassment silver mini many different<br>ways and this is also John you probably<br>shouldn't see this is a lot of faculty<br>resources and time going into preparing<br>some of these costumes this is one where<br>I was a mutant sperm this is a<br>mitochondrial built here and acrosome<br>kept this was the egg any nation have<br>decided not to come tonight thinking<br>that they might this one is almost too<br>embarrassing to talk about that I was a<br>uterus and these are there's a sperm<br>that stuck to the uterus I wait I won't<br>talk about the rest of the of the outfit<br>and this is another year when I was a<br>little bit more dull but um this is<br>actually carry malice who invented who<br>Nobel Prize winner who invented pcr<br>they're very important lab technique he<br>was so taken by what we were doing in<br>the city wanted to take it back to the<br>states and get everybody to do it this<br>is just was probably my best outfit so<br>Sheree Lynn Karen as the main architect<br>of this one this is filter paper from<br>the lab that's been dyed with all of<br>different stains that we use in<br>laboratory she spent weeks doing this<br>probably when she should have been<br>writing papers and riding grads but at<br>won the competition and she got a free<br>trip to Fiji as a result of it okay this<br>is last year when I was a was a genetics<br>conference and so reproductive<br>conference in the plant conference I was<br>Andrew the bisexual plant and I had<br>angel the be right behind me but<br>probably my best effort my won't go I<br>said running out of time this is a<br>talking about the differences in the old<br>days when we had to do everything for<br>ourselves where to prepare competent<br>cells poor erin Jill's throughout the<br>radioactivity and we have to float<br>copy things from the laboratory if we<br>were lucky then I became Andrea the<br>skanky PhD student so she's where they<br>don't turn up as the lab until quite<br>late they check everything on facebook<br>twitter and an online TV all day long<br>nobody seems to mind it's been a long<br>week would be least three days of work<br>sending all those samples we SH is<br>waiting to the bioinformatics kite<br>analyzed the data she even had to go<br>into the land to the lab the other day I<br>was reading convenience you couldn't<br>check her Facebook so anyway and<br>googling she had some problems google<br>announced so the only solution was to<br>buy more expensive kits so all the old<br>people that heard that we understood it<br>more than the young ones so I'm just<br>going to finish hopefully in the next<br>five minutes yeah hopefully so teaching<br>is important component what we do this<br>is a North Korean election where you<br>convince the students that you're<br>wonderful and hopefully they'll give you<br>all schools on that side and and so that<br>you're really great most of students<br>will recognize my slides so this is<br>where I used comic scenes and a sort of<br>yellow coloring thanks to cyberbullying<br>I've now changed my style<br>and it's now Ariel I uh I will show that<br>so one of the most amusing things that<br>happened a few years ago as the students<br>will write nice things about you and so<br>they often say he's friendly in a good<br>lecturer and the overall his lecturing<br>is very good but they're not the next<br>page there was really the only mistake<br>the only mistake that the student made<br>was that I was marking their exams at<br>the same time and the writing was rather<br>distinctive so I knew who the student<br>was a very attractive woman but one of<br>my students I thought well maybe I'm not<br>so old after all but when my students<br>pointed out that she started University<br>as a heat so so I just want to finish in<br>the last few minutes and because most of<br>us have had a very long day just talking<br>you a little bit but what I do in my<br>spare time I saw like to get out in the<br>countryside and do lots of active things<br>as a few years ago doing the coast to<br>coast which is a little jog over the<br>South Island still do a lot of running<br>around the place and go on various<br>events it's always more fun when you do<br>it with your family and it's a great way<br>of brainwashing them when they're young<br>this is a normal thing to do we live out<br>in the country side a little bit about<br>50 minutes away it's a way that I get<br>away from work and try and unwind and<br>relax just a little bit been a great<br>place to bring up kids here's my son<br>Levi with a little lamb you've said<br>Liam's born just in the last week but<br>great for them to learn about life and<br>death and some of them win competitions<br>so the kids have learnt which one's the<br>meadowlands and a lot of breeding of<br>animals around the place Levi's had a<br>lot of pets over the years this is a<br>turkey called turkey Lee's he's never<br>been short of a girlfriend and we do a<br>few other nefarious things out in the<br>countryside that might be is not settle<br>and some of you may realize I escaped<br>every few months and disappear into the<br>mountain somewhere in the South Island<br>just to try and get a little bit of<br>peace and quiet and enjoyment of the<br>countryside so that's just a little bit<br>about me thank you for being here and<br>hearing a little bit of a story about my<br>life journey and they'll pass you over<br>to Philippa I'm Phillip appalled the<br>acting head of school of medicine and<br>I'm actually standing in for Leslie<br>mccowan tonight unfortunately isn't well<br>but she's seen its loads of warm wishes<br>your way and it should given me a few<br>words to say on her behalf I will be<br>confirming to who that we've just heard<br>a masterful inaugural lecture and that<br>they were plenty of people present it's<br>really lovely to see the family and<br>thank you for allowing Andrew to enjoy<br>your lives as well as hers thank you and<br>some of you would have been coming along<br>to support andrew son would have been<br>really piqued by the title as i was<br>would that be initially over or the<br>genetics of a professor so i think we've<br>all been entertained by very deeply<br>personal and professional journey and I<br>you know found out a lot about Andrew<br>and putting your sense of humor and but<br>you know always your honesty and I think<br>you know you shouldn't apologize for all<br>those collaborators I think most of us<br>in specialty is frankly enjoy<br>working with you and value your wisdom<br>and you know really enjoy enjoy that<br>relationship so keep on doing just what<br>you're doing so you can see what a<br>gifted teacher supervisor research<br>academic leader angela's and what a gem<br>he is an hour and our faculty so it<br>really just remains to me to say you<br>know tonight's been a good example of a<br>good genes and directly with that an<br>excellent physical and family<br>environment so good testament to that so<br>please and welcome to professorial and<br>all of you can join me in thanking<br>Andrew for all his work but also his<br>friendship and also for his wonderful<br>thank you very much everybody for coming<br>along especially to family and friends<br>who braved rather cold night that angry<br>that was a wonderfully entertaining<br>lecture and suitably for our inaugural<br>lecture a third inaugural lecture it's<br>only left to me to formally close the<br>proceedings for tonight and remind<br>everybody that on Thursday night we have<br>Professor Peter Adams
