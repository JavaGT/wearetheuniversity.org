gentlemen colleagues I'm John<br>Fraser I'm the Dean of the Faculty<br>medical health sciences and it's my very<br>great pleasure to welcome you here<br>tonight to the fourth in a series of<br>inaugural lectures are a highlight about<br>academic calendar and this year we have<br>a record seven new professors presenting<br>over the coming four weeks this is in<br>fact second week we had two wonderful<br>weeks of inaugural lectures previously<br>and we have three more over the next two<br>weeks so for those of you who are<br>unfamiliar with the inaugural lectures<br>they are in fact a tradition that dates<br>back many hundreds of years to medieval<br>times as long as they've been<br>universities they've been inaugural<br>lectures I should point out that even in<br>the early times universities were<br>essentially a collection of professors<br>in those days they were only professors<br>they were recruited into an a-league<br>Brotherhood they supported one another<br>they protected each other they lived in<br>very posted surroundings away from the<br>real world answering only to themselves<br>there is at Eric interests but of course<br>expecting at the same time to be<br>handsomely remunerated I'll leave it to<br>you to that to decide whether things<br>have changed that much since then a<br>tradition that has not changed in the<br>university is the public announcement of<br>its new professors inaugural lectures<br>are a means of showcasing our most<br>eminent staff and a celebration of an<br>event that represents for many a<br>pinnacle of their academic career<br>elevation to the title of professor is<br>not something that has taken lightly in<br>academia the process of selection is<br>long and slow it involves intense<br>scrutiny by international peers who<br>signaled to the university that the<br>appointee has reached a level of<br>international reputation and eminence in<br>their field thus giving them a license<br>to say anything they like assuming that<br>everybody is going to believe them<br>inaugural lectures are also a wonderful<br>opportunity for us as colleagues friends<br>family together and to celebrate and to<br>learn about the journey that has led to<br>this wonderful achievement the<br>milestones decisions sometimes the<br>heartbreaks and most importantly the men<br>to mentors who have helped along the way<br>tonight it's my very great pleasure to<br>introduce tonight's inaudible speaker<br>professor peter adams but before I ask<br>nah recurse to provide some introductory<br>remarks I would also like to say that<br>tonight it's rather special for me<br>because Peter and I are related we are<br>in fact distant cousins and we under<br>seen it from a family who used to have a<br>beautiful home where the current<br>business school resides and I think we<br>were going to team together to find out<br>whether there was some return for us<br>from the University offering the land so<br>Peter it's a great pleasure and a<br>special delight for me tonight to<br>introduce you so I'm now going to ask<br>Mary curses the head of school of<br>population health to provide some<br>interrupter emacs Mary Jane akoto tena<br>koutou tena koutou katoa it's a great<br>pleasure to introduce Peter Adams first<br>I want to welcome his family I know his<br>mum's here the back we welcome and his<br>kids and wife and everything great it's<br>great to see everybody here I think it's<br>very important to realize this is a a<br>very very good family in public occasion<br>now I have to say that Peter on at odd<br>times has been a little bit irreverent<br>at times and so I'm going to going to<br>start that way myself so I'm just going<br>to talk for a few minutes about Peter<br>the scholar the leader the mover and the<br>shaker and today the dog's bollocks now<br>dog's bollocks I was driving along with<br>my friends from England the other day<br>and there we passed the dog's bollocks<br>pub so I started talking about the dog's<br>bollocks and she assured me that<br>actually the dog's bollocks is a<br>compliment of the very highest value and<br>so of course I went to Google urban<br>dictionary wikipedia and yes the dog's<br>bollocks in the you<br>k is the UK slang term for the best so<br>today he'd read under the dog's bollocks<br>so Peter was born and bred in Auckland<br>graduated from university of auckland in<br>the early 80s practices the clinical<br>psychologist for 13 years specializing<br>in addictive behavior and violence he he<br>was a real mover and shaker in these<br>fields developing many community<br>initiatives he formed a violence<br>collective established innovations and<br>mental health and addiction services and<br>cheered the problem gambling foundation<br>so he initially joined the university in<br>1991 to the department of psychiatry and<br>behavioral science it was on the fifth<br>floor of building 503 just above us as<br>in those days in 2000 it was a very<br>large department and was split up into<br>three academic sections and peter headed<br>up the applied behavioral science<br>section which was then located in fern<br>croft and fern craft street hmm your<br>school was the faculty was further<br>restructured restructured and tweet 2003<br>to 2004 and saw the formation of the<br>section of social and community health<br>that the school of population health<br>currently located at Tamaki and Peter<br>was the head of that section for many<br>years until 2010 he's since been<br>succeeded by LC ho and Janet Van slow<br>now serratus prestigious academic career<br>peter has focused on areas where<br>individuals are vulnerable and he's<br>worked tirelessly to improve the lot of<br>the underdog and to reduce harm now<br>alcohol and other drugs issues<br>contribute heavily to the well-being of<br>individuals and families and communities<br>and he supported in this an innovative<br>projects that aim to reduce that harm in<br>several ways through family and<br>neighbourhood responses to addictive<br>relationships through developing and<br>contributing to specialist practitioner<br>and wider health workforce development<br>through public health policy and health<br>promotion activities that empower<br>collective responses too risky<br>consumptions and also importantly<br>activities than hants the role of<br>responsible governance so<br>the mover and shaker has formed many<br>research groups darts adrc a RN and<br>recently CFR which stands the Center for<br>addictions research he's headed the<br>training he's headed up the training of<br>alcohol and drug services brief<br>intervention program the Tad's programs<br>through the good fellow for many years<br>you will remember that he's been a<br>member of the board of higher ground<br>which is an alcohol and drug recovery<br>program and he's an on the national<br>alcohol and drug treatment workforce<br>advisory group to plan the competencies<br>in that workforce now he's also set up<br>alcohol and drug services and somerville<br>you will know of lakeshore which later<br>became part of heads the community<br>alcohol and drug services so he<br>spearheaded the training which has<br>developed through the universities in<br>the undergraduate medical program he was<br>later joined by ross mccormack who we<br>all know with others and in the sections<br>he developed the alcohol and drugs<br>certificate and diploma programs<br>delivered through the school of<br>population health he supervised many<br>students he served on many committees<br>within the university and he's also<br>served as the associate postgraduate<br>dean of studies for a period he's been<br>very influential on The Bachelor of<br>Health Science development ended success<br>he currently leads the postgraduate<br>redesign for the faculty now the scholar<br>so Peter he's a writer of many articles<br>and policy documents not all of them<br>welcomed by all so I just read you the<br>title of his three books and there's one<br>to come gambling freedom and democracy<br>by routledge in 2007 fragmented intimacy<br>addiction as in the social world<br>Springer 2008 masculine Empire how men<br>use violence to keep woman in line<br>dunmore 2012 and the force to come from<br>Cambridge University Press moral<br>jeopardy risks of accepting money from<br>tobacco alcohol and gambling industries<br>Peter the scholar well established well<br>respected he is the fact<br>his critique and conscience and he's<br>always speaking up in support of social<br>democracy and the moral imperative he<br>has had a turn leading the faculty<br>equity committee and he's reminded the<br>searchers University upper echelons and<br>anyone who will listen about dangerous<br>consumptions including tainted funds I'm<br>sure we all hear some more about this<br>tonight so Peter the person steady fun<br>an enormous support to me personally as<br>head of school not least of all because<br>he likes to dress up and dance around at<br>school lunches some of you will have had<br>some experience of that he knows<br>everybody in Auckland is extremely<br>well-connected he's also a steady<br>support to his PO teachers<br>co-researchers and he Shepherds many<br>students through difficult times I<br>personally don't really know what to<br>expect from your inaugural lecture Peter<br>but I'm sure work that I would get a<br>roasting or at least some in the faculty<br>will and will enjoy it I know that we'll<br>have a lesson and that will be inspired<br>so professor peter adams well deserved<br>professorship the scholar the leader the<br>mover and shaker and today the dog's<br>bollocks I hope this week's alright<br>think you can hear me all right good<br>good good um I'm going to talk about<br>it's a beautiful body isn't it the young<br>I was told for an inaugural there were<br>two things the first thing I was told in<br>the leader was that I people have to<br>shut up and listen to me and they can<br>ask questions which is very unusual for<br>my family which will always interrupt so<br>you can't interrupt and you have to<br>believe everything I say any other thing<br>it was to talk about something I was<br>passionate about and I thought well<br>probably money on most people are<br>passionate about money so I thought I'd<br>talk about money so what the main thing<br>I want to cover today and just invite<br>you to think about is the link between<br>these two things firstly the misery<br>associated with addictive behavior and<br>the second thing is accepting money from<br>tobacco alcohol and gambling industries<br>I just want to I want to kind of link<br>those two and your mind permanently so<br>that's my task for tonight but I need to<br>go back in time I need to go back to<br>rollover group who is a Jeremy Clarkson<br>this is a this is same food crumbs here<br>this is where I started out studying<br>philosophy was studying philosophy I<br>studied philosophy for five years next<br>where I started from and I did a<br>master's in philosophy and I was I<br>really loved the whole world of ideas it<br>was a great great place to start from<br>except by the end when I got a masters<br>of philosophy I thought what the hell am<br>I going to do with it what do I do but<br>the only thing that I could think of was<br>becoming a lecturer and you know I<br>thought my god and eyes were like roll<br>over and die to end up a lick imagine<br>ending up at Electra see so like many<br>people my age you know I wind out at 22<br>I wanted to save the world so I went and<br>studied clinical psychology this is me<br>studying clinical psychology I was<br>training at the time and what you'll<br>notice is the red cracker jack gum boots<br>which when we did training in group<br>therapy when I took them often seem to<br>have an effect on people celebrate which<br>was really really difficult but look<br>after after graduating his clinical<br>psychologist I did end up working at<br>this is me at carrington hospitals my<br>first job working at carrington and I<br>was lucky enough to work in many places<br>in many whole variety of places<br>community services institutional<br>services I worked in West Auckland South<br>Auckland I got to most central Auckland<br>and in my own home base which is the<br>Northshore really well and so it's<br>really grateful for that time because it<br>I learned a lot from it and I guess<br>these three things are quite important<br>for my academic career the first one<br>really taught me to add some ask<br>questions the fact that in it in<br>philosophy you never get an answer to<br>the questions you just move on to<br>another question as another point but<br>you asked questions<br>the second thing I think was what are<br>the people that thinks so strangely<br>we're pretty weird when you start to<br>pull us apart we are really weird and I<br>think psychology gives you an interest<br>in there and finally I guess was a preg<br>more pragmatic what can we do about what<br>can we do about things what can we do to<br>change things as a key thing a month in<br>my mind so working as a clinical<br>psychologist is a bit like being at the<br>mouth of a river you're dealing with<br>fundamentally you're dealing with<br>people's misery in all sorts of ways a<br>whole variety we seem to be able to<br>become miserable in so many different<br>ways it's amazing mental health problems<br>trauma sexual abuse of buyer of violence<br>existential dilemmas which I'm having<br>now you there's all sorts of ways in<br>which misery appears before you and of<br>course you want to do something you want<br>to do something about it and and one of<br>the one of the areas i stumbled into was<br>addictions and it's a really that's a<br>really coming way of making people's<br>lives miserable it's it really does<br>create misery I'm not going to really go<br>into it much you know I assume most of<br>you have had friends or family or work<br>mates have developed addictions and some<br>form or other and you'll know that how<br>much addictions do cut into into<br>relationships and into life so what you<br>want to do is do something about it the<br>other thing I learnt as a clinical<br>psychologist was that it's very hard to<br>change and that most people you try and<br>help you have a marginal impact and you<br>know the best treatments for addiction<br>it's really only probably about thirty<br>twenty to thirty percent will change and<br>out of that probably about ten to<br>fifteen percent of those people would<br>have changed any rate so we're only<br>talking about a ten percent margin when<br>it gets down to the end of the river and<br>that that that that takes a lot of that<br>that margin is not big and it takes a<br>lot of effort to change so what I'm<br>interest became much more interested in<br>is this something upstream is this some<br>way that we could look at finding the<br>sources of what pollutes people's<br>lives to some extent what can we make a<br>difference further upstream so that's<br>been the focus I think for me in the<br>last 20 years is we we can we go<br>upstream to look at making a difference<br>so I've got to get up swim upstream that<br>was the name of the talk and I I'm not<br>very good at swimming my sister Helena<br>she is at the she's a really good<br>swimmer and ennis tells me she's<br>following in her wake so that's really<br>it's really good but what I prefer to do<br>much more is this is his about paddling<br>upstream theaters are these going back<br>this way see when when you're pedaling<br>you go faster than a swimmer but you see<br>lots of things you see penguins you see<br>dolphins and you see sea turtles I saw a<br>sea turtle last year switch it up E<br>that's very important but we knew when<br>you look up strain at what's possible um<br>here's me looking upstream um what<br>possible upstream there's many spaces<br>that you could go in to look at why<br>Missouri happens in people's lives I<br>mean one one of the big ones that we<br>look at in population health is poverty<br>another big one is the environment both<br>the physical but also the social<br>environment that we that we live in and<br>how that how that filters down stream<br>there's also inequalities a very<br>important area that our school<br>particularly is interested in and I<br>guess oppression is another really<br>critical area that I think is important<br>but one of those streams is addiction<br>one of those streams that's important in<br>the mix that leads to downstream effects<br>on people's lives as addiction I guess<br>that's the one to some extent that that<br>I've chosen to pursue so moving upstream<br>and trying to go up the river a little<br>bit<br>but this is the first area that I got<br>involved in was looking at the role of<br>families when it comes to addiction and<br>a lot of the treatment services are<br>focused on individuals very much working<br>with individuals but I would argue that<br>addiction as a social event and what's<br>really important and change is what<br>happens in the social context so working<br>with families is a big earring it's<br>still an area that I'm involved with is<br>trying to promote that area but really<br>it's still it's still not very far<br>upstream further upstream an area that I<br>have worked in a lot over time is as<br>working with violence and abuse<br>particularly violence against women at<br>sea it's a huge area and I've been<br>involved with setting up programs and<br>working with me and researching with me<br>and some of my colleagues are here it's<br>an it's a really important area but<br>again what strikes you over time as<br>people who are committed to violence<br>it's very hard to change it's very hard<br>to change we also for that area we need<br>to look further upstream so one of the<br>areas that I had been involved in a lot<br>is with the area of brief intervention<br>and that's looking at the power of a<br>brief conversation with a health<br>professional to help people make<br>decisions about their outcome and drug<br>use and I've been involved with projects<br>with the wh 0 on that and with setting<br>up community-based programs and working<br>with medical students on it and one<br>thing about it is that it is effective<br>it makes a difference but one of the<br>problems I guess with brief intervention<br>is once you stop putting encouraging<br>people to do it I stopped doing it so<br>it's keeping people doing it is one<br>thing that's really really difficult so<br>again going upstream seems to me a<br>better option so going further upstream<br>into the world of public health Public<br>Health really is finding ways that we<br>can change the environment to help the<br>whole population nudge in the direction<br>of healthy versus unhealthy choices so<br>that public health has been the area has<br>offered a lot in the area of addictive<br>consumptions particularly tobacco<br>alcohol<br>gambling but when you look at the<br>research and the evidence around public<br>health interventions the what strikes<br>you and it's been a lot of research in<br>the last 70 years in this area when you<br>start looking at what's effective this<br>is what's less effective really the most<br>effective interventions are these<br>firstly price is really powerful with<br>tobacco and alcohol we know that<br>availability of a drug is really<br>important the promotion through<br>television advertising etc is really<br>important as well product design is also<br>very important the less effective areas<br>are education awareness and behavior<br>change they have some impact but very<br>minimal impact what gets me when you<br>look around the world and including New<br>Zealand is that when it comes to looking<br>at public health interventions what<br>governments are willing to fund is on<br>the less effective site and very little<br>interest on the Watts effective site<br>this is you can you can watch that<br>pattern over years and years something's<br>going on here and I think it comes back<br>to the role of government hear that that<br>government and for some reason<br>governments are willing to throw buckets<br>of money in effective ways of<br>intervening this is effective ways so<br>what's going on well I think the<br>critical thing that's happening here is<br>the relationship between the tobacco<br>alcohol and gambling industries in<br>government we need to understand that<br>better because any anything else we do<br>in public health there's a little bit of<br>a waste of time until we get that the<br>chemistry of that right so there's<br>nothing else you can do I've got to go<br>up further upstream so a year ago again<br>have to go further up and I have to look<br>at the relationship between industry and<br>government how is it that industry is<br>able to influence government so<br>effectively around the world why does<br>that happen what's what's going on and<br>when you think about it the industry<br>itself can't afford to be seen to be<br>directly influencing<br>that would be seen as exploitive and<br>inappropriate what the industry does and<br>this is what I'm going to move on to<br>talk about is that it works through<br>intermediaries it works through people<br>who are willing to accept money from<br>those from the industry to act as a<br>bridge between themselves and government<br>and that's that's where I've been this<br>is what my talk is today about is<br>looking at what's going on here when<br>people take money or accept money from<br>these industries what role are they<br>playing in the broader picture so I need<br>to look at a few things and the first<br>thing I want to say is that addictive<br>consumptions are special they are a very<br>special form of consumption and this<br>this is a really important point for me<br>a lot of our economics is based on the<br>idea that could shoot there's based on<br>the notion of a rational consumer that<br>people buy things that people spend in a<br>market in a marketplace and they make<br>good decisions irrational decisions but<br>that doesn't mention all what's<br>happening when you're talking about<br>addictive consumption addictive<br>consumers are defined by these things<br>they have struggles with control they<br>consume more than they intend to consume<br>and they over consume despite knowing<br>the damage that's what's really with<br>addictive consumptions that's what's<br>really perplexing those who smoke will<br>notice it's really perplexing you know<br>what's going on but you continue to do<br>it they over consume what that what that<br>means over consumption means lots of<br>money doesn't it I mean if you if a<br>person's consuming even those at least<br>maybe with gambling for instance there's<br>less addicted gamblers but they spend<br>heaps and that's really important<br>another way of making this point I'm<br>sorry so what what what this means is<br>that compared to other consumptions<br>where you have the production costs in<br>the profit you've got this extra add-on<br>that comes from addictive consumption<br>itself extra add-on of money<br>and this extra add-on adds X both as an<br>incentive for industry and as the basis<br>to give the capacity it gives capacity<br>for making it for pursuing the interests<br>of consumption another way of saying<br>this would be to say if we took the<br>number of alcatraz alcohol and alcohol<br>tobacco and gambling consumers and put<br>them along one axis and along the other<br>axis we look at profit if we're looking<br>at ordinary consumption the gradient<br>would be something like this non<br>addictive consumption it might be like<br>that with a dented consumption because<br>of its very nature it being excessive<br>consumption the axis is a bit like that<br>this means that if there is a to get a<br>big to get an increase in profit for non<br>addictive consumptions you need a lot of<br>extra consumers you need a lot more<br>consumers to get extra and if to get<br>extra money from addicted consumers you<br>only need a few extra consumers the this<br>so if I was running a business my<br>interest will be in this rather than the<br>EDD non-addictive consumption because it<br>only takes a few to to increase the num<br>to make heaps of money not only that but<br>policy but particularly policy that<br>might be informed by good public health<br>it puts at risk that consumption gains<br>that I've made so the drop of a few<br>addicted consumers would lead to a huge<br>drop in the amount of money I'd make so<br>for the addictive consumption industries<br>it's really important that to manage<br>policy to make sure that policy doesn't<br>make what I've just talked about<br>possible and one example of this I think<br>was recently in the news was El Chapo he<br>was the cartel boss who was imprisoned<br>in Mexico's highest-security prison<br>he escaped through this tunnel and the<br>tunnel involves ventilation it involves<br>lighting it involves a little train that<br>runs along a railway track mean this is<br>amazing the amount of money that must<br>must be able to you know if if an<br>illicit drug where you have don't have a<br>huge public industry going going on can<br>achieve this then with tobacco alcohol<br>and gambling they can tunnel through<br>every anything they can get through any<br>rightttt into wherever they want you<br>know they've got the capacity so when<br>what I'm interested in is looking as a<br>psychologist is what happens why do<br>people buy into accepting money from<br>alcohol tobacco and gambling industry<br>what's going on well I think when the<br>money's there it's really hard to resist<br>isn't it because I think oh I just got<br>some money in my pocket here with<br>gambling argue about say half of half of<br>them gambling money comes from people in<br>misery you know either through problem<br>gambling or or poverty related impacts<br>on the home half of it comes from having<br>fun from our flutter so when I put this<br>money down maybe it's forty dollars<br>maybe it's four hundred dollars maybe<br>it's four million dollars I put it there<br>and in front of someone or they're<br>probably going to say something like oh<br>I don't like this misery money I'll just<br>can I just have thee can I just have the<br>fun money I'll say oh sorry sorry it's<br>part of the deal they both go to give<br>you either take it or leave it okay I'll<br>take it then<br>when it's there it's really hard to<br>resist and once you accept at once you<br>extent you create expectations and<br>obligations and that's reinforced<br>through multiple exchanges I'll give you<br>example for me with us was the hood fund<br>at the University of Auckland had this<br>funder but introduced about 10 years ago<br>it's a fund that allows you to bring<br>over after at the time it was thirty<br>thousand dollars and you could bring a<br>bigwig from the northern hemisphere to<br>work with you for maybe a month and<br>develop projects and we said hot<br>this is fantastic so we are setting up<br>together and we we looked at we were<br>going to get bringing this expert over<br>from Detroit who was into Community<br>Development and we were going to do all<br>these projects with her it was fantastic<br>so I went home all steamed up and I<br>started filling out on my computer the<br>application form so it sees nominations<br>for hood visiting fellowship name I<br>could do that present position yep yep<br>great the fields of research community<br>at department that's right yeah oops<br>right down the bottom what I ran into<br>was this generously supported by the<br>Lion Foundation it's bloody money from<br>problem gamblers this is this isn't<br>convenient very inconvenient so what can<br>you do about that well my first response<br>I didn't see that you know we've done so<br>much work already and this is going to<br>be a great project just pretend it's not<br>there just you know and then we won't<br>say anything to anybody and then we'll<br>find out later on and it's too late I<br>thought I'd do that the next response<br>was this it was a bargaining response<br>because I didn't think I'd get away with<br>that one for long and this one was kind<br>of look maybe gambling's not that bad if<br>it has its positive sites there's only a<br>few a few people who have problems and<br>with gambling and we can't spoil it for<br>the rest of us Peter done by saying that<br>yesterday having something I think leave<br>but look I knew this is industry speak<br>it's all but it's what they say<br>and people believe it I knew it was<br>wrong so I had to find another resource<br>the next resource was more of a<br>missionary response was not the money<br>sitting there it's the earth someone's<br>got to use it and this funding will save<br>rise it will make a difference on the<br>eve of the adjudicators arrival some<br>travelers moved into Callan Park<br>before you could say gypsy scum we were<br>knee-deep in dog muck thieving kids and<br>crusty jugglers crusty jugglers we lost<br>them sergeant you should be ashamed<br>calling yourself a community that cares<br>but we do care Nicholas all about the<br>greater good how can this be for the<br>greater good so for the greater good for<br>the greater good if we need to get rid<br>of gypsy scum and crusty jugglers we we<br>need to do this so for the greater good<br>jörg liners are come on the greater good<br>for the greater good oh so for the<br>greater good we have to and besides if<br>we don't get it some other undeserving<br>bastard and physiology or our history<br>who's gonna get it he's not gonna do<br>anything it's it's just not it's just<br>not for you look I we had in our<br>department at the time we had a unit and<br>tobacco a unit and gambling and a unit<br>dealing with our pond drive so I didn't<br>think I could get away with that I<br>needed a stronger one the macho response<br>the macho response is this you have to<br>be realistic you have to do some dirty<br>things and make unpopular choices if<br>you've got to get on in life really if<br>you say no to tobacco alcohol and<br>gambling you're going to have to say no<br>to fossil fuels and then you'll have to<br>say no to pharmaceuticals and imagine a<br>faculty faculty like ours without<br>pharmaceutical money we can't afford to<br>can't afford to let let let this um let<br>this get out of hand I think probably<br>what what's going on is that my desire<br>to take the money in my values<br>particularly when the money's there<br>start to start to clash and the messages<br>in my mind tend to favor my ambitions<br>the ethical perspective is often<br>minimized and I think to some extent are<br>probably in those times I need some form<br>of outside reference point to gauge my<br>the problem is that when it comes down<br>to accepting money you very often shrink<br>everything down to a simple transaction<br>between me and the donor but really<br>there's a much broader context going on<br>a much wider range of functions that are<br>that are happening and I want to touch<br>on this now I want to kind of kind of<br>look at the wider picture around the<br>round funding when we looking at the<br>relationship between tobacco alkyl and<br>gambling industries and government I<br>think what's important to recognize is<br>that there is a chain of connections a<br>chain of Link's going on of numbers of<br>people who are accepting money in<br>various ways that enables influence to<br>occur at a government level and I'm<br>going to describe these change in terms<br>of 3 i'm going to describe them in terms<br>of three connecting chains the first<br>chain i call the political chain this is<br>a low visibility chain and its primary<br>purposes fiercely is to establish in<br>people's minds that industry is a<br>legitimate business it is industry plant<br>is a key player and the vitality of our<br>economy and it builds blue long and the<br>aim of this chain is to build long-term<br>relations with political actors so along<br>this chain Fester's that multinational<br>corporates have their communication<br>strategies and policies that guide at a<br>local level producer and retail<br>associations like the like the<br>hospitality Association the brewery the<br>Brewers Association etc that in in that<br>league then the lobbying and PR<br>companies work with industry and<br>associations in building relationships<br>with political actors particularly<br>politicians in studying this chain what<br>you find is that the industry is working<br>maybe ten years ahead they're working<br>it's a long-term strategy relationship<br>building is really important it's built<br>over long periods of time recently the<br>British Medical Journal general has been<br>doing a series of studies on the<br>infiltrating how the liquor industry<br>infiltrated the UK Parliament here's the<br>UK chart<br>so George Osborne awarded beer drinker<br>of the year associated with his helping<br>them out with liquid and as a text on<br>duty sport for liquor imports and that<br>but one of the things they looked at is<br>the all party MP beer group 400 MPs<br>belong to the beer group and they meet<br>regularly in the houses of parliament<br>and I guess that's a space in which<br>which industry people and political<br>actors connect over time and plain<br>really important role in David Cameron's<br>reversing his promise to introduce<br>minimum unit pricing which is a very<br>effective way of reducing harmful<br>drinking and so these that I think this<br>is what's prompted the British Medical<br>Journal to look at this in more detail<br>how how are these relationships achieved<br>the second chain that's important is the<br>public good chain on the public good<br>chain the purpose here is to convince<br>people that the industry is a good<br>corporate citizen that industry is<br>handling the harms and that it is<br>individuals not systems that are<br>responsible for these harms so on this<br>chain fiercely are the corporate social<br>responsibility programs very flesh<br>investments and maybe aids programs in<br>Africa woman's violence programs all<br>sorts of programs that give industry a<br>profile and also in the in the case of<br>overseas aid helps industry connect with<br>political actors within those countries<br>the second one is these called social<br>aspects and public relations<br>organizations I spend a lot of time<br>studying these they're hundreds around<br>the world they're very interesting but<br>primarily the industry funded<br>organizations that provide interventions<br>for alcohol alcohol and tobacco related<br>harm but with a particular focus on<br>individuals and trying to divert<br>attention away from public public health<br>interventions next is community health<br>health and community programs<br>organization set like schools and<br>artis that receive money from tobacco<br>alkyl and gambling next is media<br>coverage to make sure that people know<br>about what's going on and finally public<br>consultation the policy makers connect<br>through select committees through<br>opinion surveys all this chain is<br>leading to as public positive public<br>example of the cipro is the drink wines<br>in Australia drinkwise was<br>industry-funded like they all are<br>they're doing something very visible<br>about harm from alcohol such as binge<br>drinking public awareness alcohol and<br>pregnancy drink driving underage<br>drinking pretty much the same sort of<br>programs that most net pros do but as<br>you can see that all focused on<br>individual chain downloading<br>responsibility to the individual and<br>away from the broader context in which<br>change should be occurring finally the<br>most important thing work for this<br>location is the knowledge gained this is<br>a moderately visible chain and the<br>purposes here is to convince people that<br>industry knows its own business best<br>industry shapes that their industry<br>needs to shape the research agenda and<br>it we need to create a credible<br>proconsul acredita pro consumption<br>knowledge base so the the chains along<br>here officially a priority setting<br>processes funding but really the center<br>of this chain really is researchers and<br>research organizations like universities<br>it's their engagement that's been<br>critical that's been critical and it's<br>looking at how been looking at lots of<br>researchers around the world in terms of<br>how they get engaged in these industries<br>and our and I think the main it's it's<br>Connor a series of steps that people<br>make Beasley is the industry handshake<br>next is a pilot project that gets funded<br>it doesn't matter what the hell you do<br>as long as you know it's about<br>establishing a relationship next is the<br>offer for more significant money then<br>ongoing funding then membership of this<br>stable the industry stable tobacco<br>research stable or the alcohols research<br>stable<br>and the ultimate prize is when ur you<br>get a credible researcher who can<br>communicate directly in a pro<br>consumption way with with policymakers<br>just run through a few examples Ernst<br>wender was a epic demonologist he he lit<br>one of the first to blink smoking to<br>lung cancer but he also did research<br>funded by Philip Morris the major<br>tobacco company between 1961 and 1990<br>his handshake started in 1955 he did his<br>pilot in 61 he had 50 million dollars of<br>resources and 69 that then that became<br>regular amounts of money he then became<br>an important person and the philip<br>morris stable and became a important<br>person and speaking out against passive<br>smoking so as part of he was recruited<br>into that into that mission another<br>example is the Brazilian utter utter<br>gerard de Andrade in Brazil he was at<br>the State University of San Paulo he<br>heads a center a separate called Caesar<br>and his hands take shape has started<br>with mb of the big liquor giant by the<br>mid-2000s he had formed Caesar they<br>involved with education project but then<br>he moved into doing research in Caesar<br>and ninety percent of his money for<br>research came from from the industry by<br>late 2000s he was an important in dust<br>and he became a key advisor to in Brazil<br>to state both state and federal<br>governments finally is a gambling<br>example as Howard cheaper at you at<br>Harvard his handshake followed a very<br>similar pattern to the other ones I'm<br>not going to go right through it but as<br>you can see he ends up as a prominent<br>researcher with advising at a government<br>level I just want to comment on gambling<br>research it's extraordinary I can't<br>believe it most the prominent<br>researchers in that field are receiving<br>either personally or their institutions<br>that receive<br>money from the gambling industry so the<br>gambling industry practically owns the<br>research in this eerie it's a really<br>serious serious problem I think and it's<br>something some of us are trying to do<br>something about okay so what I've been<br>arguing here is that the there are three<br>chains that that create linkages between<br>the industry and between government<br>sector agencies the these chains there's<br>a lot of doubling up on them but but<br>it's there's so many opportunities for<br>an individual to become part or become<br>members of links on those chains so I<br>thought I probably worth focusing on our<br>own institution and look at some of the<br>ways in which the University of Auckland<br>has engaged with these industries my<br>first experience was doing my PhD in the<br>psychology department there there was a<br>psychophysiological lab there when I was<br>there it did research on sleep but also<br>did some research on emotional aspects<br>of smoking it was funded primarily by<br>the tobacco industry by Philip Morris<br>again and these are some of the these<br>were some of the grants that they got<br>from the philip morris as you can see<br>the typing is improved over the years<br>perhaps you know I think when Auckland<br>uni services got involved sorry that<br>probably made the difference i'm not<br>sure but what was extraordinary there<br>was that no one talked about it well i<br>was there this was money flowing and no<br>one took we kind of knew I even shared<br>an office with a post-grad postdoc and<br>he never talked about it either it was<br>like in and I think that's that what<br>that suggests that this research is very<br>much on the knowledge chain because it's<br>this silence about it this is very<br>different than many of the other forms<br>of engagement the University of Auckland<br>has the DB breweries linkages with<br>leading light scholarships the Lion<br>Foundation sponsoring of seminars of<br>course we just enjoyed goldie wine so<br>we're part of the industry itself<br>god damn it and also the hood fellowship<br>which I've come back to again which was<br>from poking money and I think the food<br>fellowship regulations are really<br>interesting if you look through them the<br>twelfth item and this is this the lead<br>sponsor for Lion Foundation should be<br>mentioned at all publicity surrounding<br>the hood fellow including the<br>introduction of public seminars and the<br>lion foundation logo must have beer in<br>all publicity materials this says that<br>this is on the public good chain it's<br>really important that it's highly<br>visible the relationship so that's<br>what's important for the industry and<br>that in that linkage for our own faculty<br>I think some of the engagements that<br>we've had the b1 and spirits council was<br>a was a an association that represented<br>the industry in New Zealand the medical<br>research advisory committee they formed<br>involved many of our senior members of<br>faculty including current / Dean at the<br>time also the brute when that collapsed<br>the Brewers Association was informed for<br>both Australia and New Zealand and one<br>of our senior staff was the sole medical<br>advisor for that and finally has they've<br>been the appointment of the Lion<br>Foundation chair in emergency medicine<br>funded in conjunction with it's a<br>appointment in conjunction worth with<br>Counties Manukau dhb and that's a really<br>interesting one again the emphasis on<br>having the term Lion Foundation at the<br>front betrays that this is about the<br>public good chain again as the<br>visibility is really important so I'm<br>I've been really interesting interested<br>in what we can do about oh I would treat<br>accepting money from dangerous<br>consumptions as industry money is a<br>dangerous consumption in its own right<br>and I'm interested and there's some sort<br>of the kind of interventions we couldn't<br>involve in making a difference the I<br>just talked about two of them the first<br>one is ethical decision-making<br>strategies and the second one is to do<br>with establishing some sort of<br>benchmarks the first one I think what's<br>helpful is to is to move away from<br>thinking of accepting money as a either<br>or<br>either you accept orally don't you clean<br>you're an angel you're a devil I think<br>it's better to think of it as a<br>continuum of risk that that there are<br>various possessions that people need to<br>think about where they want so what's<br>important here is not whether or not<br>it's if at what point where do you draw<br>the line so if we've looked at the type<br>of consumptions that you could take<br>money from maybe oil at one end<br>armaments depends who you are Alastair<br>might put it differently the<br>pharmaceuticals industry lotteries porn<br>pokies alcohol all these industries<br>create Parman in various ways you could<br>put the line near or you might want to<br>shift it along a bit further or you<br>might want to shift it to there what's<br>important is that there is some<br>discussion and that you try and work out<br>where you want to position yourself and<br>I are most interested in looking at<br>those organizations which enter into<br>into high-risk and extremely high-risk<br>relationships so one of the strategies<br>that I've developed is the development<br>of our set of indicators that help<br>people work out whether or not these<br>relationships are going to hazardous or<br>not the first one is looking at purpose<br>how have the purposes match if you're<br>trying to improve the health of the<br>community but you get taking money from<br>alcohol they don't match that well I<br>would argue what is the extent of the<br>relationship if you move from five<br>percent funding to ten percent funding<br>there's a risk of you being silenced by<br>that relevant firm how much how harmful<br>is the product lotteries compared to<br>pokies identifies how visible having DB<br>on your rugby jersey or not how visible<br>is a relationship and finally what is<br>the directness of the link are you<br>getting money directly or is it going<br>through another body the this what I've<br>call apparel analysis has been used<br>around the world in different places to<br>try and help people estimate the extent<br>there which they get on it allows you to<br>do this sort of thing is to look if<br>you're looking at low risk to extremely<br>high risk so if we take one group a<br>public health research you're receiving<br>funds directly from a tobacco company<br>in a publicly visible way well you've<br>got pretty harmful product you've got<br>visibility you've got a you've got a<br>real clash of purpose going on so that's<br>I would argue is extremely high risk and<br>some of the others are also reasonably<br>high high risk to extremely high risk<br>one of the points I want to make is that<br>these examples are all research examples<br>it seems to me when you look at the role<br>of researchers and universities the<br>risks are too high I would argue when<br>you start looking at them closely in<br>terms of taking money from these sources<br>so I think that we need to question<br>these relationships and look at petite<br>may be developing some sort of policy<br>position if universities in gauging with<br>industry money firstly it supports in<br>industry legitimacy in policy it adds to<br>the public credibility of industry it<br>influences what and how knowledge is<br>assembled and that in terms of critical<br>conscious peaking personally it promotes<br>fear of speaking out it really promotes<br>it makes it difficult to speak out<br>openly about things so I would advocate<br>for a traffic light approach where we<br>have some classes of consumption that we<br>could tail at a university level we have<br>a policy of not receiving money from<br>tobacco armaments pokies and alcohol we<br>look at some as they do in many<br>universities in the state's have some<br>way of managing other types of dangerous<br>consumptions and maybe having our<br>conflicts of interest committee that<br>handles that and finally we maybe look<br>at a pornography or plastic surgery you<br>might put these in different classes but<br>it's simply better of monitoring those<br>relationships so what I hope I've done<br>is connect in your minds the act of<br>accepting money from industry and the<br>relationship with the miseries<br>associated with addictive consumption I<br>hope that high god made that connection<br>but before I finish I just want to make<br>a few a few acknowledgments some of<br>people in the past<br>I haven't got much time but I'll just<br>touch on first one I mean and was<br>someone when I was started University a<br>very famous philosopher of science Paul<br>far oven came to Auckland he came for<br>two winters and lectured he really<br>sparked up an interest in ideas for me<br>and I at the tender age of 18 he really<br>convinced me that science is a form of<br>myth-making with very interesting forms<br>of propaganda involved and also I want<br>to acknowledge Clive Pearson who taught<br>in the philosophy department and I<br>studied under him for five years and<br>Clive was he taught Martin Heidegger but<br>really it was Clive he taught and he was<br>many of us were inspired by players<br>teaching when I thought about psychology<br>I couldn't think of anyone really who<br>inspired me but the but people the<br>people that did inspire me with clients<br>and particularly people colleagues<br>who've come through recovery processes<br>themselves people like Kim and men and<br>Ralph and and Jill these people I work<br>side-by-side with who were in recovery<br>themselves taught me so much about<br>addiction about humility about all sorts<br>of things that go with that with that<br>territory so they were very inspiring<br>when it comes to health I think probably<br>the the people that I really have<br>learned so much off have been two people<br>have done phd's with me i I've had the<br>privilege to to supervise over twenty<br>five PhDs these are some of the faces<br>some of them and I don't think they<br>realize how much of our journey it is<br>for for me you know that it each each<br>one is an adventure and I learn heaps as<br>well I mean they'd be worried about you<br>know the work in that but I'm enjoying<br>the whole ride it's a really really it's<br>been a great privilege working with with<br>you guys I think I want to acknowledge<br>my family I think some summary some of<br>them are here this is my brothers and<br>sisters and their partners and also our<br>offspring some of them are here to have<br>a yo-yo from there from the clan through<br>the year right great I particularly want<br>to acknowledge two people my mother<br>Nellie here my father Bob mum's here dad<br>passed away and three years ago and I we<br>still miss him a lot but i also really<br>want to acknowledge my own children my<br>four children and my partner Jude Jude's<br>here somewhere and and Jude has put up<br>with me for a hell of a long time she's<br>been a great support and a lot of what<br>I've done wouldn't be possible without<br>her so I just want to acknowledge here<br>support during these years with four<br>children<br>we to next well I still got a lot of<br>pedaling to do but really what I'm I'm<br>going a bit bulge my hair's gone gray<br>and I'm getting fat and i'm getting all<br>wrinkly so that these are all signs that<br>i'm not going to live forever it's a bit<br>of a shock but i'm not going to live<br>forever so I do want to achieve a few<br>things before I snuff it and one thing<br>that I one thing that was difficult was<br>when and I we need to write articles<br>here and I three thousand word articles<br>sometimes people write fewer words but I<br>find jeepers to write three thousand<br>words what can you say in three thousand<br>words this is an issue I did this I've<br>got that I this is what it means and<br>that's that no what what what it's just<br>not enough space give me learn lots of<br>land and the sunny sky above don't fence<br>me and I just had to say them what I<br>have become had about eight years ago I<br>switched to writing books so instead of<br>three thousand word through 133,000<br>words now that's space that's great it's<br>really really gives you lots of space to<br>look at an issue in its complexity you<br>can't know an article look at the<br>complexity of some of these issues so to<br>be able to write or the whole you know<br>in right I don't know if anyone reads it<br>but it's to ride it as<br>fantastic and so I started with this<br>book my second book which was on on<br>addiction and as a social event my third<br>book with in sharm ians here I hope the<br>publisher thank you for coming for this<br>book masc empire how to how to keep your<br>woman online and finally this is the<br>book that's coming out later this year<br>moral jeopardy risks to accepting money<br>for Tibet I'm going to be sued already<br>worried about this one but it's coming<br>out and you're all going to buy it and<br>read it aren't you I've written another<br>couple of books which i'd like to get<br>published and I've started a couple this<br>year that are really mad but they're<br>there they're keeping me happy I'm going<br>to keep working with the center for<br>addiction research we've got such a<br>great group by the management team that<br>I work with janie David Susannah Natalie<br>and Denise we work closely together and<br>it's great working with them but also on<br>the broader front connecting with the<br>agencies that we work closely with<br>Odyssey house cads problem gambling<br>foundation high ground the Salvation<br>Army and matter are some of the agencies<br>that we connect without their own<br>Rebecca I forgot to mention alcohol<br>HealthWatch I'm sorry but these agencies<br>are ones that we that we work with and<br>really value but i guess the home base<br>is the school of population health and<br>we have got such a wonderful group of<br>people there such a diverse and<br>wonderful group of people so I've been<br>it's been a great privilege working with<br>people and this in the school so oh how<br>much time in the phone my trajectory has<br>been this I started in the world of<br>ideas in the world of philosophy and for<br>the first 20 years it's been a one of<br>tracking down stream right down to the<br>dam downstream and then in the second<br>half of my career the next 20 years has<br>been going upstream<br>and really where I've come to i think is<br>into this crater lake which is the world<br>of ideas that i and and but I've come<br>back to that lake with all the other<br>equipment that I from downstream a<br>concern about what can work our concern<br>for what how do we change issues around<br>misery and I want to I want to<br>explore this this lake of ideas a lot<br>more I've got lots of more peddling to<br>do and also i want to take people with<br>me so one of the classes what are the<br>one of the courses i've established is<br>Peter's wonderful world of theory it's<br>that's what i call it but i think it's<br>called something else rather boring but<br>that's the cause i teach two masked to<br>to honor students and PhD students and<br>it's just i think it's i think the world<br>of ideas is the fountainhead it's the<br>source of so much of what we do in<br>academia and yet we neglect it and i<br>want to bring attention back to that<br>back to that world so I don't know how<br>to finish these talks but I thought I'd<br>finish worth just um quite my<br>grandfather used to tell me when I was a<br>boy he said this I have lived to bury my<br>desires I've seen my dreams corrode and<br>dust I got it in the ax mum and i'm not<br>sure what he's trying to tell me at that<br>age but i'm a lot clearer and now what<br>he's on a bit and yes thank you very<br>congratulations Peter my name is matt<br>baer i'm the associate dean academic and<br>I'm not I was very honored when Peter<br>asked me if I'd give the vote of thanks<br>and I wondered why but I guess it's<br>because peter has been one of those<br>people who's been very influential and<br>arguing with me and dragging me into his<br>wonderful world of theory and examine<br>some people belong to book groups but<br>there's a group of us we've only been to<br>it once but we're going to do it a lot<br>more that immediately school of<br>population health to look into all sorts<br>of theories so we've got a list of<br>people we're going to look at and we<br>terrify each other by trying to read the<br>text and in argue about what they mean<br>so thank you Peter for a wonderful<br>speech I guess I saw some of Peters<br>notes and so I knew what he was going to<br>say but I want it and then made me think<br>so what should I say to sum up and I<br>think it is you know democratic<br>societies like ours enshrine the idea of<br>academic freedom and legislation and law<br>and we do this because we believe that<br>it is good for the Academy and society<br>to encourage academics particularly<br>professors I guess to examine and hold<br>an advanced contribution of ideas and<br>challenge the status quo as Peter<br>assumes the mantle of Professor I think<br>we can all be pretty sure that that the<br>status that his status to confront us<br>with difficult and controversial ideas<br>won't go away some of us might make us<br>uncomfortable but don't you get stuck<br>with Peter and I guess I do know that<br>sometimes it makes Peter uncomfortable<br>in to worry but I say Pierre Qatar Peter<br>keep it up so all it remains for me to<br>do is to thank you all for coming in to<br>thank you very much mark Larry and of<br>course thank you very much Peter for a<br>wonderfully enlightening and challenging<br>inaugural lecture so it's a lift to me<br>to close the formal proceedings and I'd<br>like to thank you all for coming tonight<br>and just remind you that next tuesday we<br>have an extra normal lecture which is<br>Professor Chris print so I hope to see<br>you there and thank you for coming good<br>night</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
