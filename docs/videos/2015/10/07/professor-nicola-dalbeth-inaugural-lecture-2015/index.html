who are new to<br>inaugural lectures I'd like to introduce<br>myself I am the Dean of the faculty mr.<br>John Fraser and I like to introduce the<br>the ideas of the inaugural lectures and<br>then we are followed by some entry<br>introductory remarks tonight from<br>distinguished professor Ian Reed<br>followed by inaugural speaker for<br>tonight professor Nicola Delvian Nobel<br>lectures are in fact one of the<br>highlights of our academic career this<br>year we have a record seven new<br>professors and as I've said this is a<br>sixth of a seven we have professor<br>seminary on Thursday evening<br>they are the highlight of our academic<br>career because they are quite a<br>significant milestone in one's academic<br>career they are a tradition dates back a<br>very very long time they they date back<br>as far as medieval times in those days<br>universities were much much smaller than<br>they are today now we were really just a<br>collection of professors very little<br>else in those days they were an elite<br>Brotherhood they were elected by each<br>other they were supported by each other<br>and protected they lived in quested<br>surroundings away from the real world<br>answerable only to themselves and to<br>their esoteric interests Wow<br>expecting at the same time to be paid<br>exceptionally well I'll leave it to you<br>to decide whether things have changed<br>that night all joking aside inaugural<br>lectures are a wonderful tradition they<br>haven't changed and they for many<br>hundreds of years and they are a way in<br>which universities publicly announced<br>their new professors they are a means of<br>showcasing our most eminent staff and a<br>celebration of event that represents in<br>many cases the pinnacle of one's<br>academic career elevation to the title<br>of professor is not taken lightly<br>it's a process of selection that is long<br>and torturous involves intense scrutiny<br>by international peers within signal to<br>the university that the individual meets<br>the requirements of an international<br>reputation and an eminent eminent expert<br>in their field thus giving them the<br>license to say anything they like but<br>thinking that people will believe what<br>they say they are also a wonderful<br>opportunity for colleagues family and<br>friends together to learn about the<br>journey that has led to academic success<br>the milestones decisions sometimes the<br>heart breaks but most importantly the<br>mentors that have helped along the way<br>and tonight it's my very great pleasure<br>to introduce tonight's and overall<br>speaker professor Nicola bell Beth and I<br>shall ask distinguished professor Ian<br>Reed to provide some introductory<br>remarks<br>thank you John in addition to welcoming<br>all of you which Don's already done just<br>to highlight the fact and extend a<br>welcome to Andrew Niccol husband Maisy<br>and Henry her son and daughter and to<br>her parents pay a million mm-hmm<br>Nicholas started life in Kyoto bleep<br>people here who hadn't been to kayo<br>mm-hmm and three years later I moved on<br>to Rotorua we're probably most of us<br>have been and know where it is she<br>progressed through her primary and<br>secondary education they're going to<br>Rotorua girls high school somewhere<br>around that time she met Andrew and<br>sometime later married him the one thing<br>she said I was not to say was that she<br>was a child bride and I will not say<br>that my good man and then if the<br>indefinite time at high school moved on<br>to Otago where she graduated as the top<br>undergraduates six years later one of<br>the many important things that happened<br>during that time was doing a some<br>studentship with John - where which was<br>possibly her first contact with<br>Rheumatology and I think that's just a<br>nice example of how important summer<br>studentships have been to many of us in<br>terms of setting the track for our<br>future career hmm she then returned to<br>Rotorua and did the first house suit in<br>year there there's actually a dalworth<br>road in Rotorua now whether that's<br>testimony to the distinction of neckla<br>as the house surgeon or to Andrews<br>forebears I'm not quite sure of it<br>there's not too many how certain to have<br>notes that they share a name with in the<br>small town sepsis there and then she<br>came to Auckland where she did her house<br>engineers one up here he guideth in that<br>time was Peter black and he was an<br>instrumental and luring Nicola back to<br>Auckland subsequently and then did some<br>general medicine registrar jobs again<br>one of her key min towards their being<br>max Robertson out at Middlemore<br>and then moved on to rheumatology and<br>worked with the Auckland rheumatologists<br>of the time lucky MacLean nourlangie<br>Fiona McQueen being some of the people<br>who were guided her at that stage this<br>brings us through to 2001 which was not<br>very long ago for someone who's becoming<br>a professor so nice and then she went<br>off to Oxford and subsequently Imperial<br>College in London and worked at the<br>nathie Orthopaedic Center and a<br>Wetherill Institute in Oxford and as I<br>said an Imperial College in London and<br>then I think about 2005 had an important<br>conversation with Peter back about what<br>should I do with my life than here Paris<br>had to come back here and I think was<br>about that time that I first heard<br>Nicolas name she wrote me a letter<br>saying could she come and work in our<br>group and I asked a few people about his<br>list Nikolov outburst fish and they all<br>said she's fantastic you've got of<br>trying to get up but we didn't have any<br>money to support her research fellow so<br>I sort of my standing and wrote back and<br>said well sure we'll provide you the web<br>space if you could get some grants to<br>support yourself and that seen a lot of<br>people off and so Nicola wrote to me I'm<br>not sure how many months later so I've<br>got three grants now is that enough and<br>that's really been the story of<br>niccola's life that she's fantastically<br>energetic and gets things done and makes<br>things happen and so she's been in<br>Auckland as part of the bone and joint<br>research group we had to change the name<br>to accommodate who rheumatological<br>interests and the spectacular amount has<br>been achieved in that time I think one<br>of the things she was very strategic<br>about having worked and inflammatory<br>arthritis in her time in the UK and<br>that's usually interpreted my bone<br>person's point of view as being<br>rheumatoid arthritis Nicola saw they're<br>actually gaps is a key issue for New<br>Zealand and Auckland in many ways<br>there's the world capital of gout and so<br>she redirected her studies and towards<br>the end of your time in the UK towards<br>gout and has literally become the world<br>expert on the subject and so if you go<br>into expert scape you will find that the<br>University of Auckland was is rated as<br>the top institution in the world for<br>gout research and that's substantially a<br>tribute to niccola's work and she is<br>rated as the world's top individual<br>expert in that particular area<br>that's a spectacular achievement in a<br>decade of work in that decade she's<br>produced a couple of hundred papers but<br>she's also worked very hard and a whole<br>lot of other areas you see that patient<br>groups around gout and a lot of her gout<br>research has succeeded because she's<br>brought the community that select a<br>flick to buy gout on side with her she's<br>really done more than her fair share of<br>work within the university serving on<br>groups such as the Ethics Committee<br>which is a major undertaking and also<br>contributing a lot to the supervision of<br>undergraduate and postgraduate students<br>she's also provided leadership in the<br>hospital sector so she's someone who<br>seems somehow rather able to tick all of<br>these boxes and incidentally along the<br>way just to have a family and obviously<br>Andrews support has been fantastically<br>important in making that happen<br>so Nicola is an extremely personable<br>high achieving colleague she's a little<br>scary at times in terms of her<br>efficiency and makes the rest it was a<br>little bit slow but that's okay she is a<br>joy and inspiration to work with as I<br>said before she's extraordinarily young<br>to be a professor but it is an accolade<br>that she has been absolutely in the<br>decade that she's been in Auckland and<br>the time before that in Oxford the kudos<br>that comes with this appointment will<br>empower her to continue her upward<br>trajectory in research and in clinical<br>leadership to the benefit of her<br>patients her students the University and<br>the hospitals within which she works so<br>Tenneco so couture well thank you so<br>much to all of you for actually braving<br>this terrible night and coming out and<br>it's so wonderful to see so many friends<br>colleagues family here so it's it's<br>really wonderful thank you so much so<br>I'm going to focus my lecture talking<br>about gout not surprisingly I think and<br>really reflect on where we are where<br>we've come from and where I hope we will<br>be in future decades now I just like to<br>start by just really describing or<br>explaining this picture which is a<br>beautiful picture taken by dragging a<br>pool in our in a laboratory and this is<br>a picture under polarizing light<br>microscopy of at ofus and here we see<br>numerous monosodium urate crystals and<br>this is really the core lesion that<br>causes gout and this is the lesion that<br>we really try very hard to manage in our<br>clinical situation so first of all I'll<br>just give you a brief outline about what<br>gout actually is talk about some of the<br>issues around barriers to effective<br>treatment and then talk about the role<br>of research in defining the impact of<br>disease the mechanisms of disease and<br>also the best treatments for people with<br>gout and finally I'd like to finish by<br>talking about what I see is hopefully a<br>better future for people with gout so<br>what does go out first of all so gout is<br>a form of arthritis and it's caused by<br>monosodium urate crystals these crystals<br>that form in the joint in the presence<br>of high blood urine acid levels so gout<br>is a really common form of arthritis it<br>affects about 1 and 25 adults in altero<br>in New Zealand it's more common in men<br>and it basically usually initially<br>presents as these acute episodes a very<br>severe joint pain and here we can see a<br>patient with acute gout with very severe<br>inflammation of the big toe and also the<br>ankle here<br>and this person would be unable to walk<br>there being unable to really even have<br>their sheet on the bed because of this<br>very severe pain in some people who have<br>prolonged elevations of the urate level<br>toe fascia Scout occurs and this is the<br>disease that we've been particularly<br>interested in and focus focusing on in<br>our research so here we have these large<br>swellings of the joint which are<br>collections of uric acid crystals and<br>these crystals essentially cause joint<br>damage and and a lot of deformity<br>difficulty finding shoes they can<br>discharge ulcerate and really they cause<br>a lot of problems for for people with<br>gout so in order to achieve effective<br>treatment of gout the key target is to<br>get the uric acid level down and if we<br>do this the crystals dissolve the gout<br>attacks settle down the toe fie these<br>big lumps they get smaller so this is<br>really the key focus of our treatment is<br>to get the blood uric acid level down<br>and the way we do this most often with<br>is with a medicine called L o Puran all<br>and this is really the first line<br>treatment for people with gout to get<br>the uric acid level down it's incredibly<br>cheap costs about ten dollars a year as<br>far as the prescription for people the<br>important thing is is that patients need<br>to take it every single day but it's a<br>very effective medicine when used when<br>use properly so great we've got a<br>treatment it's been around for 60 years<br>it's a cheap drug fantastic should be no<br>problem at all<br>gout why would go it'd be a problem well<br>it clearly is because if we look at data<br>from New Zealand if we look at data<br>really anywhere in the world we see that<br>gout is routinely poorly treated<br>everywhere in the world pretty much and<br>certainly in New Zealand that is the<br>case so if we look at New Zealanders<br>with gout a pretty conservative estimate<br>is that forty percent of New Zealanders<br>with gout get allopurinol regular<br>allopurinol prescriptions it may well<br>actually be even lower<br>and off because of this less than a<br>quarter of people with God actually<br>achieved the target uric acid levels so<br>really we're just not<br>we're not managing this disease at all<br>well within the community and really a<br>lot of this work has come out of a lot<br>of this understanding has work has come<br>out of work with the Ministry of Health<br>through the atlas of healthcare<br>variation we have this beautiful site on<br>their website I'd recommend if you're<br>interested to go and actually have a<br>look at the site you can actually look<br>at data look at different regions of New<br>Zealand and look at who's getting<br>allopurinol who isn't getting<br>allopurinol really beautiful website<br>actually and and and I think this very<br>clearly shows that areas such as<br>counties Monaco the East Coast Northland<br>where there's a lot of gout<br>not much ello Piron all being prescribed<br>so why is gout so poorly managed I think<br>there are a number of things that drive<br>this and we've started to get a concept<br>of this through some of the qualitative<br>work that we've done I think it's very<br>clear that within the community people<br>seek out as a disease that's self<br>inflicted that people bring on because<br>of their personal indiscretions they've<br>eaten too much then they drank too much<br>it's all their own fault what do they<br>expect of course they've got gout<br>there's also a belief that gout is an<br>acute illness it's not a chronic disease<br>of crystal depositions so you get the<br>attack you treat it it goes away it's<br>not a problem whereas in fact the<br>crystals continue to form I think this<br>really leads to a lack of understanding<br>about the role of urate lowering therapy<br>there's a lot of fear in the community<br>about leop Renauld side-effects and<br>there's also a general kind of nihilism<br>about actually whether patients will<br>even take their medicine and if they do<br>how effective that's going to be the<br>other thing that also becomes very clear<br>is that everybody think one thing Scout<br>is really hilarious okay and this is<br>just an example this is a this is a<br>headline from last year and the<br>independent for those of you can't read<br>it North Korean news that Kingdom Jong<br>un has gout is no laughing<br>mater he does have a nuclear arsenal<br>remember with that in mind I say get<br>well soon mr. Kenan so again gout as the<br>you know as the butt of everyone's joke<br>it's a funny condition it doesn't really<br>need to be taken seriously but when we<br>hear the patient's experience I think we<br>really start to understand that actually<br>this is a serious condition it really<br>impacts enormous lian people's life it<br>has an impact on the way that they can<br>function within families their ability<br>to work their quality of life and this<br>is work that came out of of a<br>qualitative stunt study done by Karen<br>Lindsay many years ago now when she was<br>a Rheumatology fellow and I think the<br>study was really key to really<br>galvanizing us to understand the impact<br>of disease and I'm just going to read<br>this because this is one of the<br>patient's experience well when I get it<br>there's a lot of throbbing in the area<br>it feels like the area that's inflamed<br>it's cooking it's hot a real hot<br>sensation it feels like the flesh is<br>trying to rip you're outside like it's<br>going to burst your skin is stretching<br>and it's going to rip because it's<br>stretching so much so really a very<br>unpleasant experience and really it was<br>with these stories these patient stories<br>that I think really galvanized many of<br>us to really think about different<br>strategies for how to actually manage<br>gout and this work really led to<br>establishment of the maori gout action<br>group which is a collection of people<br>who i've listed some of the people here<br>doctors health care workers other health<br>care workers people from arthritis new<br>zealand maori health workers really a<br>variety of people in both primary<br>secondary care public health who have<br>come together really to think about how<br>we can address this issue and I'd really<br>like to acknowledge this group because I<br>think this group has been really very<br>important in visual guiding the research<br>we do but also the advocacy within the<br>community in the last 10 years so as<br>part of this group the Moldy got action<br>group put together a gout responsiveness<br>plan<br>and within that plan was research and<br>this is really the area that I have<br>really contributed most to Peter Gale<br>arthritis New Zealand many other people<br>have done a lot of work with patient<br>resource development community clinics<br>strategic partners particularly<br>partnering with arthritis New Zealand<br>who have been very strong supporters of<br>this work and really a focus on dis<br>stigmatization so one of the advantages<br>of being involved in the maori girl<br>action group is we get to go to these<br>lovely hui and and here i'm showing you<br>some images from a hui that we we went<br>to in Tokomaru Bay in 2001 and certainly<br>a really beautiful site just to really<br>introduce this quote which is the people<br>of the Pacific belonged to one large<br>gouty family and this is a quote from<br>Cal Grant who's really one of the<br>godfathers of Rheumatology really<br>recognizing something that we haven't<br>haven't really quantified to any great<br>extent until very recently so we really<br>started to do this probably about seven<br>or eight years ago now and this is work<br>that doon when art from counties Monaco<br>really led really trying to get a handle<br>on on the impact and prevalence of gout<br>in our Tarot in New Zealand so what I'm<br>going to show you here are the data for<br>men and these are the data from 2009 and<br>this is from the altero and new zealand<br>health tracker so this is basically<br>everyone in New Zealand who has a<br>national health index number is included<br>in this data set so most of us are<br>included in this data set and so<br>basically what we did was using some<br>algorithms to identify people with gout<br>identified those the prevalence in those<br>at various ages so here we have 20 to 24<br>increasing up to 85 years here we have a<br>prevalence of 0% and up here 50% the<br>purple shows the overall prevalence for<br>the entire country so you can see that<br>as we age it's more likely that we will<br>develop now or have gout<br>if we then look at the ethnicity data I<br>think there's a very clear pattern here<br>and this is something that we'd all seen<br>in our clinics that perhaps hadn't<br>really quantify to any great extent so<br>if we look here in the light blue we can<br>see in New Zealand European and red New<br>Zealand Asian in dark blue Maori and in<br>green Pacific and I think you can see<br>that really at every age Maori and<br>Pacific men are affected by gout about 3<br>times as often as as other as other<br>populations in New Zealand so certainly<br>a very important burden of disease if we<br>look at women gay affects women less<br>frequently affects women more after the<br>menopause but again these differences in<br>ethnicities so much more common in Maori<br>and Pacific women compared to women of<br>other ethnicities in New Zealand we've<br>also done quite a lot of work trying to<br>understand the impact of disease for<br>individuals with gout so this is work<br>that we did many years ago in fact Kate<br>Gregory who was my first summer<br>studentship summer student who's now a<br>Rheumatology register I actually did<br>this did this project this is Sue's<br>summer studentship many years ago now<br>and this was a study where we we study<br>men with or patients with gout came in<br>and we just basically assessed their<br>hand function and what was very clear<br>was that those patients who had Toph I<br>had major problems with their group they<br>had difficulty really with just very<br>simple tasks that all of us just take<br>for granted more recently we've done<br>similar work led by keith rome at aut<br>looking at the impact of gout on foot<br>function and of course gout most often<br>affects the foot and again we can see<br>really marked differences in gait and<br>mini gait parameters related to to<br>heaven gout and urate crystals<br>deposition in addition we've now<br>developed a questionnaire and I'm really<br>I think this is a really fabulous<br>questionnaire for a couple of reasons<br>over tire RT who worked with me for many<br>years who's now a medical student did<br>his master's and<br>and really developed this questionnaire<br>and it's hosted on the faculty website<br>so it's really been we've had a lot of<br>support from the faculty to get this<br>questionnaire actually up and running so<br>so I think that's a really great<br>achievement as well in addition to<br>understanding the impact we've also<br>really focused a lot on defining the<br>mechanisms of GART understanding that<br>this is a disease of chronic uric acid<br>deposition and here we see some<br>dual-energy CT scans of patients who<br>have no clinically active guard these<br>are not people who are coming and saying<br>I've got a sore foot at the moment there<br>are people who have had disease<br>previously but we can see on these scans<br>these uric acid crystals color coded and<br>green throughout the joint so even when<br>patients aren't flaring even when<br>they're not saying oh my foot hurts the<br>crystals are still there and we can<br>really see this beautifully on the<br>imaging methods we've also spent a lot<br>of time trying to understand the<br>mechanisms of hyperuricemia and this is<br>work that we've done in collaboration<br>with tony merriment at OU Targo funded<br>by several HRC program grants now really<br>trying to understand the genetics of<br>this disease which is clearly quite<br>different in Maori and Pacific people<br>compared with New Zealand European or<br>other other populations we've identified<br>certain genes that are very strongly<br>associated with gout and Maori Pacific<br>people we have actually identified just<br>just you know hot-off-the-press the<br>first specific gene for Maori and<br>Pacific people and it's very interesting<br>that pretty much all of the genes that<br>we've identified as being important are<br>related to the way that the kidney<br>handles uric acid so this is a very<br>different concept of gout as a disease<br>of dietary excess this is really gout as<br>a disease of kidney dysfunction of the<br>way that our kidneys handle uric acid<br>of course diet is important and work<br>that we've done with the genetics of<br>gout in our our study has has shown this<br>and this is just some data looking at<br>sugary drinks and showing that for those<br>people who are drinking a lot of sugary<br>drinks the likelihood of having<br>is much higher but again data from our<br>group has shown that there are genetic<br>factors that interact with sugar<br>sweetened drinks to increase the risk<br>for some people and not for others so<br>this is a very complex interaction it's<br>not just about people doing the wrong<br>thing and the work that I've really<br>primarily focused on in the lab and also<br>with the imaging group as well has been<br>understanding joint damage and people<br>with gout and this is just these are<br>just some of the images from our study<br>where we've looked at urate crystals<br>deposition and the relationship between<br>your a crystal deposition here<br>color-coded and green and these typical<br>areas of joint damage in people with<br>gout so clearly crystals are driving a<br>lot of the joint damage that we're<br>seeing in people with gout the lab work<br>has focused on bone but also on<br>cartilage and tendon as well and I've<br>stolen here a beautiful diagram from a<br>sheikh of China and so I do apologize<br>for that edge but I think this really<br>summarizes the work that that we've done<br>particularly eshte slid in the last few<br>years really trying to understand the<br>mechanisms of disease in cartilage in<br>bone and also in tendon and for each of<br>these sites we see crystals really<br>having a marked effect on the tissues<br>around them causing damage and and and<br>structural problems are at each of these<br>sites and finally of course treatment<br>because ultimately we really want to use<br>these data to improve outcomes for<br>patients so I'll just remind you again<br>of this really important target which is<br>getting the serum your rate below point<br>three six and one of the first studies<br>that we did many years ago now in<br>Counties Manukau DHB with Peter gallant<br>Anil Kumar was looking at L o P Ronaldo<br>Singh and in those days we were very<br>conservative with our leop Ronaldo Singh<br>so we would give tiny doses of people of<br>la Pira naltar people with kidney<br>disease and then we would just say oh<br>dear L o P Renauld hasn't worked<br>what a shame we don't have any other<br>options because in those days we really<br>didn't have<br>of other options and the work that we<br>did there demonstrated that actually<br>most of the people who who were on these<br>very small doses of allopurinol weren't<br>getting anywhere near their serum your<br>eighth target but if the dose was<br>increased then a lot more patients we're<br>achieving this target and this is then<br>led on to a number of studies led by<br>Lisa Stamp who's again another really<br>sort of key collaborator for me<br>who Lisa initially did some dose<br>escalation studies and open and open<br>labeled studies and showed that this<br>approach was very well tolerated very<br>effective almost 90% of people actually<br>achieving target and we're just in the<br>process of completing a randomised<br>controlled trial specifically looking at<br>this and this will be reported early<br>next year one of the really exciting<br>possibilities for me I having studied<br>joint damage and gout for many years is<br>that joint damage itself may be<br>reversible we don't have a lot of data<br>to show that but we do have some data<br>from a small study of patients who had<br>very very intensive urate lowering<br>therapy these were patients that I<br>collaborated with in the u.s. two years<br>after this very intensive treatment we<br>can see the bone erosion that was<br>present at baseline is healing very<br>nicely and certainly major improvements<br>in the erosion score perhaps not so much<br>in cartilage but but I think it's it's<br>certainly possible that with very<br>intensive urate lowering therapy we may<br>be able to achieve healing of some of<br>this joint damage of course ultimately<br>it would be better to avoid that we also<br>have a whole lot of therapies that are<br>going to be coming to market so this is<br>a very exciting field we've been<br>involved in clinical trials and clinical<br>trial development of a number of these<br>agents so I think this is really a very<br>exciting time you know for almost 60<br>years we've had allopurinol as our main<br>treatment and now we're seeing more and<br>more treatments becoming available so<br>certainly really great it's not all<br>about the drugs<br>unfortunately that was<br>it's not all about the drugs other<br>factors are important as well so foot<br>care of the feet is also very important<br>for people who have very severe gout and<br>this is again a clinical trial led by<br>Keith Rome demonstrating that patients<br>who receive good Footwear can have<br>improvements in their pain and<br>disability and this is something that we<br>really need to advocate for for our<br>patients and also looking at dietary<br>strategies and and this is just one of<br>the studies that we did with Fonterra a<br>number of years ago looking for various<br>milk products for treatment of gout and<br>certainly milk products do have them do<br>it allow patients to achieve a mild<br>reduction in uric acid levels but this<br>is really nowhere near where they need<br>to be so this is an adjunct rather than<br>the mainstay of treatment so one of the<br>things that we've really worked hard on<br>particularly in within the MALDI gout<br>action group is trying to apply these<br>findings of research into improved<br>outcomes for patients and I'd really<br>like to acknowledge Susan Reed here<br>because she's who's in fact in the<br>audience who's a health literacy expert<br>who's really done some amazing work<br>really translating some of these<br>findings in these concepts into<br>resources for patients and for<br>practitioners actually to improve<br>outcomes for people with Garten and I'd<br>really recommend this lovely little<br>handout for those of you who are seeing<br>people with gout in your clinics for<br>example this is the one to be using<br>we've also had a bit of an offensive on<br>really dissemination so lots of local<br>dissemination b-pack guidelines we've<br>introduced the gout symposium as the<br>main teaching for our undergraduate<br>program for the formal teachings so all<br>medical students now hear about gout as<br>part of the program and and hopefully<br>get the the right messages about about<br>gout management we've developed clinical<br>pathways within primary care and I think<br>one of the really exciting things has<br>been the application of the genetics<br>research and the research more generally<br>about the<br>Hector disease into actually advocacy<br>for patients so I mentioned before this<br>SLC 209 which is a gene that is very is<br>very important for the cause of gout and<br>people with a particularly mild in<br>Pacific people SLC 209 is targeted by a<br>specific drug called Ben's bro Marone<br>and this was part of the part of the<br>application that we actually made to<br>PHARMAC to get this drug funded and<br>thermic really amazingly funded this<br>drug on section 29 so not even approved<br>by made safe but basically funded this<br>drug because they saw this with such<br>high need based on the if based on the<br>advocacy from from the maori guard<br>action group and again four bucks is<br>that another new drug that would again<br>reduces the uric acid levels again mid<br>safe expedited approval because of high<br>need and again this was supported by the<br>Maori guard action groups so you know<br>this is a group who really has been<br>doing this in you know doing other jobs<br>and really doing this part-time but a<br>group of people who've come together<br>really fantastic advocacy and<br>coordination I have to say so I think<br>research has been really important and<br>improving the outcomes for people with<br>gout I think it's helped us to define<br>the problem which is really important<br>when we're looking at advocacy<br>advocating for therapies I think it's<br>been really important for awareness<br>raising for destigmatize ation advocacy<br>for targeted drug therapies and also<br>opportunities for education as we<br>recruit within the community as well so<br>you know I think that research is not<br>separate to practice actually research<br>can really lead to improved care for<br>individuals and also for for the wider<br>community as well so we are at where are<br>we heading well I hope we're heading<br>towards a better future for people with<br>gout I think we really are starting to<br>see a change in the perception of<br>disease as the treatable form of<br>arthritis as a chronic disease of urate<br>crystals deposition I think we've really<br>worked hard at dispelling the myths that<br>this is all about diet<br>really really targeting on the on the<br>serum your eight level I think this is<br>hopefully and I hope well at least I<br>hope we will see earlier use of urate<br>lowering therapy bitter use of old drugs<br>and I think L o P Renault will remain<br>the main treatment and we just need to<br>be using it a lot better but also<br>combinations of old and new therapies<br>and ultimately I hope we will not be<br>seeing these crystals anymore and we<br>will be seeing patients who are<br>achieving target who have fewer<br>prescriptions for anti-inflammatory<br>drugs which are very toxic who have less<br>joint damage less toe fascias disease<br>less time off work more participation<br>and less disability so I just like to<br>finish with some acknowledgments first<br>of all I'd really like to acknowledge<br>the many patients who have contributed<br>to our research projects we've recruited<br>thousands of patients in Auckland over<br>the last ten years and really we've had<br>amazing support from patients we've had<br>really wonderful funding support from<br>HRC AM RAF lotteries the University<br>through the faculty funds lector Pharma<br>and also the Auckland regional<br>Rheumatology trust there are many people<br>who work on these projects and I have<br>tried to list every one here I do<br>apologize if I've missed anyone I'd<br>certainly like to acknowledge bringing<br>up all who's really a key person in the<br>lab in a sheikah China<br>and the other members of the bone<br>research group who are just really<br>fantastic colleagues and incredibly<br>professional the the guys who have been<br>doing the recruitment over the years<br>oppa tyre Paul Julie Chris Jordan Megan<br>and horn who just runs a really amazing<br>unit the members of the Auckland<br>Rheumatology Imaging Group particularly<br>Antony Doyle who really has scored so<br>many CTS and MRIs over the years so it's<br>really been wonderful the many other<br>collaborators my colleagues at 88<br>be Maria Lobo Megan Williams Ravi super<br>Julia Martin who are just a really<br>lovely group of people to work with I've<br>already mentioned the Maori girl action<br>group and I just like to finish by<br>acknowledging several of my mentors and<br>people who have really been incredibly<br>supportive Jill and Ian who welcomed me<br>into their group when really they didn't<br>know who the hell I was and really we're<br>incredibly supportive and have have<br>really just made it it's so easy to<br>actually get going which was really<br>wonderful<br>Fiona McQueen who unfortunately can't be<br>here who again has been really an<br>amazing mentor and support for many<br>years and also Peter gal who<br>unfortunately is ill but again Peter has<br>been really a stalwart of Garrett<br>management has been working on gout in<br>Auckland for a good 30 years and and I<br>think really I can't I can't say enough<br>about Peter I just also like to finish<br>by acknowledging my family my parents<br>who have been an incredible support and<br>and just wonderful for many years my my<br>the rest of my family are many of whom<br>are here today and finally I'd like to<br>acknowledge my kids Maisie and Henry and<br>also my wonderful husband Andrew who<br>really just makes the whole enterprise<br>kind of work and is just an amazing<br>person so thank you I'm Philippa pullin<br>the head of the department of medicine<br>and acting head of the school of<br>medicine and thank you all from the<br>school for coming along to this really<br>important and special occasion not only<br>for Nicola but for us all in the school<br>and the faculty and thank you to the<br>family for letting us have so much of<br>Nicola - we're really lucky I think<br>you'll agree that we've really seen a<br>masterful lecture tonight that's taken<br>us from basic science through clinical<br>science clinical observation and then to<br>the research lab and then translating it<br>back to into the community and you know<br>that<br>a really rare kind of set of skills and<br>really shows I think the importance of<br>having clinical epidemics and the<br>secretary and what they can bring and<br>Peter ghoul didn't want me to say you<br>know how much Nikolas work has actually<br>contributed to the health and well-being<br>of the communities in South Auckland and<br>obviously with around the world now city<br>work becomes more well known now there<br>is an old Maori proverb codata kumara a<br>corridor more toner archaic er probably<br>shouldn't mention sweet in this context<br>but anyway the Qumran never speaks of<br>its own sweetness and I think you know<br>I'd really want to say to Natalie no and<br>apart from all this amazing research<br>you're just the most wonderful colleague<br>thank you and you were serenity and<br>professionalism just never fail to amaze<br>me and always take on extra work to<br>teach you lead you conduct all this<br>research and you know really haven't<br>must debates that's applied to join the<br>faculty in 2005 properly and as one of<br>who I'm ash one of his students said to<br>me things often don't go to plan in the<br>lab but Nicola manages to see the bright<br>side and helps make me see that there's<br>always something to learn from failed<br>experiments she also taught me how to<br>have research integrity how to do things<br>properly and honestly she has very high<br>morals and ensures that we only publish<br>or present results of the very highest<br>quality so eco Ian's words in a very<br>short academic career and the cover<br>you've already achieved so much we're so<br>proud to have you in our medicine is our<br>newest professor please join me in<br>those last words and I should also like<br>to echo my own sentiments that Nicola<br>has been one of the more meteoric Rises<br>within the faculty and she is very young<br>and I expect we'll see many more years<br>of quality research and quality medicine<br>from you so congratulations again<br>welcome to the profit Soria and thank<br>you all for coming tonight and just to<br>remind you that we seventh the last a<br>normal lecture is Professor Sally Murray<br>and that will be on Thursday night so I<br>hope you can attend me thank you for<br>coming</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
