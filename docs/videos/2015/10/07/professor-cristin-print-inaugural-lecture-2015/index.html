helped his roller coaster ride from studying clover pasture enzymes, through spells in mountaineering medicine, gene knockouts and biotech companies, to the current excitement of genomics.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening ladies and gentlemen I'm<br>John Fraser the Dean of the Faculty<br>medical and Health Sciences and it's a<br>very great pleasure to have you here<br>tonight for our fifth inaugural lecture<br>and a series of seven it's a very wet<br>wintry night so it's a pleasure to see<br>so many of you here before we start the<br>lecture for tonight I'd just like to<br>introduce the inaugural lectures they<br>are in fact a very old tradition in<br>academia they date back many hundreds of<br>years they are the highlight of our<br>academic career of our academic calendar<br>and they are one of the more enjoyable<br>events that we provide both to our<br>colleagues and also to the public so as<br>I said inaugural lectures are a<br>tradition that date back to medieval<br>times in those days universities were<br>very small they were typically just a<br>collection of professors they were<br>typically recruited and into an elite<br>Brotherhood that supported and protected<br>each other they lived in cloistered<br>surroundings well away from the real<br>world they answered only to themselves<br>into the esoteric subjects but still<br>expected to be paid handsomely for the<br>fact that they were smarter than<br>everybody else I'll leave it to you to<br>decide whether you think things have<br>changed too much since those days all<br>joking aside inaugural lectures are away<br>in which the university announces its<br>new professors they are a means of<br>showcasing our most eminent staff a<br>celebration of event that represents for<br>many the pinnacles of one's academic<br>career elevation to the title of<br>professor is not taken lightly<br>the process of selection is long<br>involved and requires intense scrutiny<br>by international peers who confirmed to<br>the University that the appointee meets<br>the international level of eminence or<br>imminent expert in their field thus<br>giving them a license to say anything<br>they like in their chosen subject with<br>the sure knowledge that people will<br>believe what they say<br>the normal lectures are also a wonderful<br>opportunity for family and friends<br>colleagues together to celebrate this<br>occasion and to learn about the journey<br>that the individual has been on the<br>academic success the milestones the<br>decisions the failures the heartbreaks<br>but most importantly the mentors who<br>have helped them along the way tonight<br>it's my very great pleasure to introduce<br>tonight's lecture professor Christian<br>Prince and I'll ask the head of the<br>school of Medical Sciences professor<br>Paul Johnson to provide some<br>introductory remarks Paul good evening<br>everybody<br>and it's as Professor Prince in a school<br>it's my pleasure to introduce christen<br>to summarize some of the many<br>achievements that have seen him promoted<br>to the rank of Professor as pointed out<br>by the Dean promotion professor is an<br>involved process in which the candidate<br>has to have shown international<br>distinction in outstanding leadership in<br>the domains of research teaching and<br>service in this regard Chris is more<br>than a worthy recipient of the title<br>Chris's academic journey to the rank of<br>Professor started with his graduation<br>he didn't work as a house surgeon in<br>Dunedin before he ever took where he<br>undertook Asuna researchers one of his<br>first taste of research before returning<br>back up north to embark on a PhD in<br>molecular immunology at the University<br>of Auckland Chris's research interests<br>then took him to the Walter and Eliza<br>Hall Institute in Melbourne for four<br>years where he studied the mechanisms of<br>programmed cell death or apoptosis from<br>Melbourne Chris moved to Cambridge<br>University in the UK where as a fellow<br>of San Edmunds College he researched<br>endothelial cell and reproductive<br>genomics while as a fellow of Cambridge<br>College he also gained valuable<br>experience in many aspects of tertiary<br>education including selecting<br>high-quality postgraduate students<br>investing in their pastoral care the art<br>of communication of science mentorship<br>and organizational leadership as well as<br>this he seemed to find enough time in<br>the UK to actually co-found a<br>bioinformatics biotechnology company<br>which was cap named gene networks<br>International which was successfully<br>listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in<br>2007 so on the basis of all these<br>achievements Chris was recruited back to<br>the University of Auckland in 2005 it's<br>an associate professor of pathology and<br>since this time he has led a<br>cross-disciplinary research team of<br>clinicians biologists statisticians<br>mathematicians in the effort to better<br>understand cancer pathology this during<br>his period the combined effort of this<br>team is resolved in some 58 publications<br>32 funded research projects which have<br>amassed a total of 12 million dollars in<br>research funds quite an achievement<br>now as a university academic a large<br>amount of Chris's time has of course<br>been involved visited in education these<br>education processes have<br>have included the full spectrum of<br>curriculum development course<br>coordination designing innovative<br>scenario based teaching and this effort<br>has resulted in Chris being awarded a<br>number of student teaching awards<br>he has also led a new web-based teaching<br>initiative new forms of assessment<br>shared program reviews and acted as a<br>member of the 11 person team to revise<br>the entire medical teaching program<br>which has just undergone accreditation<br>at the postgraduate level Chris has<br>obtained funding from Rotary clubs<br>foundation of resurgent technology in<br>the bridge between research trust to set<br>up in an annual internship which allows<br>clinicians to spend time learning about<br>genomics and bioinformatics in Chris's<br>because of Chris's deep interest in<br>ensuring ethical use of genomic data and<br>medicine in research in ensuring that it<br>benefits all groups in New Zealand Chris<br>has found himself involved in a number<br>of leadership roles both within and<br>outside the university he's the director<br>of the university's biomedics Institute<br>the president of the New Zealand Society<br>for oncology data rate was down it's a<br>long list<br>chair of the Advisory Committee of the<br>Auckland regional tissue bank a member<br>of the University of Auckland's II<br>research advisory board a member of the<br>Council of the Auckland museum Institute<br>the advisory board for the university<br>initiative of complex biological systems<br>quite a list on top of this since<br>returning to Auckland Chris has<br>organized 11 international conferences<br>that were actually held in New Zealand<br>bringing overseas researchers to New<br>Zealand to gain those networks and this<br>has resulted in some 75 invited ports<br>and media introduced most recently he's<br>been recognized for a surface-to-surface<br>to cancer surgeon<br>education by an Auckland Rotary Club<br>Paul Harrison will<br>so in closing yes I'm sure you will<br>agree this is an impressive list of<br>achievements across all the three<br>pillars of academic like research<br>teaching and service with a major<br>characteristic of this effort being the<br>leadership demonstrated by Chris and all<br>of these three domains to me the thing<br>that I most depressed about Chris in my<br>interactions with them is that we<br>usually finish our meetings with Chris<br>saying I'm happy to help or just let me<br>know what I can do well tonight Chris<br>you can tell us in your own words about<br>your academic journey and the pathway it<br>has led to your success well first of<br>all thank you very much for the kind<br>introduction I feel quite overwhelmed by<br>that I am going to give a summary of<br>several aspects of my career but what I<br>really want to be emphasizing in this is<br>that it's not really my career what I<br>want to talk to you about is teams and I<br>want to set the scene at the start of my<br>talk by showing you a rather unusual<br>video once I've shown you that I'm going<br>to give you a summary of the general<br>areas that I work in I'm going to make<br>this unapologetically a lay summary<br>there's a lot of people very important<br>to me here who are not people like many<br>of us who think about molecular science<br>all the time after that I'm going to<br>take you on my rather eclectic journey<br>through biology looking at different<br>parts little examples of the things I've<br>enjoyed most ending up with some<br>fantastic projects on lucky enough to be<br>undertaking at present I want to show<br>you a video that's a youtube video that<br>my wife found and this is a American<br>thing called pool dunking where American<br>college students get together and they<br>work as teams to do the most incredible<br>things and I hope I can get this two to<br>play<br>just just watch this this guy's got his<br>leaf blower with his ball he commits to<br>so I think these guys are amazing<br>they've actually got a whole youtube<br>channel to themselves where they spend I<br>think all this summers doing this but<br>the reason I'm showing you this is it's<br>all about teams isn't it and it's a<br>wonderful analogy for medical research<br>first of all every one of these guys had<br>their own thing to do and they did it<br>well you imagine the perseverance<br>required they must have tried that a<br>hundred times to get it right that's<br>exactly what we do every day and<br>research there's some quiet leadership<br>going on there's no one obvious leader<br>but by searching on YouTube the guy<br>really seems to be leading is actually<br>this little guy hiding up here behind<br>the camera and that that's my favored<br>way I think that group should be led so<br>I just wanted to give you that as a<br>example of the sort of joy I get out of<br>research working in teams I don't<br>imagine myself every day doing that but<br>I wish we could do that as part of our<br>project so to start off with my lecture<br>I want to give you a quick introduction<br>and a fairly license to the technologies<br>we use a lot of my research career has<br>been about technology<br>first of all technologies to understand<br>molecules function of different genes<br>ending up with technologies to sequence<br>genomes and really understand how<br>changes to genes and genomes can cause<br>disease starting off at the most basic<br>level of course we we have our genes<br>which of course are double-stranded DNA<br>these genes are turned into an<br>intermediate form called RNA and the RNA<br>is simply a template for which we make<br>at the proteins and the proteins of the<br>structural building blocks of course of<br>our body the interesting thing about<br>this RNA is that we can measure the<br>amount of RNA to work out how much each<br>gene has been used one of the things of<br>course that happens in disease is that<br>we can get mutations in these genes<br>genes<br>have some of the individual what we call<br>bases their individual building blocks<br>deleted or changed we can also give<br>extra copies of genes lose whole copies<br>of genes genes can be muddled up in<br>their order another thing that happens<br>in disease is we use more or less than<br>we should of individual genes and we<br>often talk about that as reduced gene<br>expression or more gene expression so by<br>studying the mutations in these genes or<br>how we're using more or less of<br>individual genes and would be normal we<br>can start to catalogue the real basis<br>right deep underneath disease so just to<br>reiterate that the idea of mutations<br>causing disease where you get changes in<br>the code of the genes leading to changes<br>in proteins or even loss of genes or<br>extra copies and the idea of changes in<br>the amount of genes that are used which<br>we can measure by the amount of this<br>intermediate stuff called RNA so over<br>the last few years we've gained this<br>magical ability to sequence our genes<br>and sequence our DNA and the way we do<br>that is we take the long strands of DNA<br>and we randomly cut them up into tiny<br>little fragments and these fragments we<br>stick on a slide rather like a<br>microscope slide and we use some enzymes<br>some proteins that can function to do<br>stuff and these enzymes gradually<br>rebuild copies of the DNA and as these<br>copies are rebuilt they let out a flash<br>of light of a different color depending<br>on what of the different building blocks<br>or bases is added at each time and you<br>end up getting a video of these<br>different colors on a piece of glass and<br>by interpreting this video you can<br>interpret for each of these random<br>fragments the order of the DNA bases the<br>order of the building blocks in the<br>fragments once your sequencing machine<br>has produced all of these random<br>fragments you have a situation rather<br>like a jigsaw puzzle you've got all<br>these fragments and you have to then map<br>them back<br>what you know of the human genome some<br>of the fragments are easy like the tree<br>and the jigsaw puzzle would be easy to<br>place other fragments are much harder to<br>place the blue sky for example usually<br>we have a lot of these fragments<br>covering every part of the genome so we<br>can assemble or overlay these fragments<br>on one another and that allows us to<br>tolerate some errors that naturally<br>occur during the process I'm very<br>indebted to several people who've kindly<br>let me use their slides for this so<br>these technologies have slowly got<br>better and better over the last 10 or so<br>years we have this thing in science<br>called Moore's law which was developed<br>in 1965 and it's really about the<br>exponential increase in the number of<br>transistors you can fit on a computer<br>chip over time and what is happening in<br>this graph is that on the bottom axis<br>we're showing the years on the top axis<br>we're showing the costs to sequence a<br>genome moore's law or an exponential<br>reduction and cost would be the straight<br>line the costs of sequencing human<br>genomes though and after the period of<br>these technologies starting which I've<br>told you about<br>has started to decrease much more<br>rapidly than exponential so just a few<br>years ago we had these big sequencing<br>machines like this these would be the<br>machines that would take all these<br>fragments of our human DNA and read them<br>get the sequence nowadays we've got<br>these most fantastic things we've got<br>small sequences that called minions that<br>you can hold in the palm of your hand<br>and plug into the laptop USB port or<br>we've got big sequences that can<br>sequence 18,000 human genomes every year<br>so the first human genome that was<br>sequenced cost about three billion<br>dollars and took about 12 to 13 years to<br>sequence but nowadays we could sequence<br>one of your genomes for as little as<br>about $3,000 u.s. prices may be coming<br>down even beyond that<br>and we it can be done in as little as<br>three days a little bit of extra time to<br>process the data so one of the reasons<br>that we sequence genomes is to determine<br>the inherited pattern of DNA that is<br>different for all of us which may<br>predispose to disease or may modify how<br>diseases we acquire work we're all very<br>similar our closest living relatives the<br>chimpanzees are only different from us<br>in about four percent of their basis and<br>most of us whom about 99.9 percent<br>identical we're only about 1.1 percent<br>difference in the individual DNA bases<br>in our genome we actually even more<br>different than that in extra copies or<br>lack of copies of some of our genes or<br>about 0.4% different in that regard but<br>generally were all very similar so the<br>Human Genome Project was actually<br>finished in 2003 and this was finding<br>the draft sequence of the human genome<br>it wasn't a single person it was a set<br>of people and the first single person to<br>have the DNA sequenced was really around<br>2007 to 2009 a whole crop of them came<br>craig Venter a genomics entrepreneur was<br>the first the very famous Jim Watson who<br>co-discovered the structure of the DNA<br>was the second and a Korean scientist<br>song Duncan was the third and one of my<br>favorite statistics was that actually<br>the Korean scientist was much closer in<br>their DNA sequence to the to Europe<br>European counterparts European<br>collaborators then the two Europeans<br>were to one another<br>and that's a wonderful demonstration of<br>the very blurred boundaries of ethnicity<br>and race isn't it so we don't know how<br>many people have had their genome<br>sequence but we think about up to<br>300,000 people have had some level of<br>sequencing done to their genome and the<br>commentators in the field estimate that<br>there'll be a doubling about<br>every 12 months of the number of people<br>who have had the genome sequenced so<br>people like me who love this type of<br>data and this type of work face a real<br>tsunami of data which we're very<br>frightened of we are not going to cope<br>so information about DNA and about<br>genomes about how much each gene is used<br>is massive and size but this is just<br>data it really doesn't mean very much in<br>on its own it has little value until we<br>distill information out of it and that's<br>what the field I work in bioinformatics<br>is my field gets information out of big<br>pieces of data and there's a number of<br>violent petitions in the room who unlike<br>me are properly trained<br>bioinformaticians who've actually done<br>degrees in bioinformatics I've come to<br>this late I'm an amateur and I'm always<br>in debt for their advice so I told you<br>how big the data is that we tend to be<br>looking at it's very hard to make sense<br>of it just by looking at the raw data we<br>have to organize it in some way and a<br>lot of that organization involves<br>mathematics which was one of my favorite<br>subjects at school and I'm delighted to<br>be able to come back to it as I get<br>older we often build mathematical models<br>to distill information from genomic data<br>this is a wonderful scientific paper<br>that's quite accessible to non<br>scientists called can a biologist fix a<br>radio by yury lasered Nick who at that<br>point was a postdoctoral fellow at the<br>Cold Spring Harbor laboratories<br>northeast of New York and what he was<br>saying in this paper that was published<br>in the eminent Journal cancer cell is<br>that scientists need to beware because<br>the systems that they're analyzing the<br>sort of data they're going to get from<br>their systems is going to very quickly<br>get so complex that they're going to<br>need four more models to understand it<br>and we certainly have come to that point<br>today<br>a lot of people hear the word model and<br>they think of something very flaky and<br>imaginary representation of what's going<br>on an experiment and if that's what you<br>think I completely agree with you I<br>spend a lot of my time reviewing papers<br>where I'm trying to politely say that<br>there really isn't enough evidence for<br>the model people present being<br>meaningful in some of the first-year<br>bioinformatics teaching that I used to<br>do I used to give students some randomly<br>muddled up data where I take the gene<br>names and Iran de Mele reassign them to<br>different genes and then I'd ask the<br>students to go away and use various<br>software packages that identify<br>different molecular pathways that may be<br>going on or inactivated in the data and<br>most of the students would come back<br>with these fantastic findings that would<br>be very meaningful and at the end of the<br>lesson I tell them that this was random<br>data one of the most difficult parts of<br>this field of bioinformatics is<br>controlling for what we call false<br>discovery controlling for when there is<br>apparently something real but it's there<br>by chance that is the core thing we do<br>here's a lovely quote from a Systems<br>biologist Samuel Carla the purpose of<br>these mathematical models is not to fit<br>the data it's to sharpen the biological<br>question so a lot of what we do is<br>bioinformaticians when we distill<br>information from data is we generate<br>sharp questions that can then be taken<br>forward in a laboratory or an animal<br>model or by clinical trials and what I<br>really enjoy about what I do is that I<br>collaborate with people in my research<br>group who go into the laboratory and<br>they test the hypotheses that come out<br>of their data we often think of that<br>what we know about how cells and tissues<br>function where different genes encode<br>proteins and operate in networks or<br>Cascades to achieve a function and we<br>often call these molecular<br>waise and if we put lots of molecular<br>pathways and different sorts of data<br>together that's the science of systems<br>biology really trying to build models of<br>a cell by using these molecular pathways<br>we can come to sharp hypotheses that can<br>we can then go back and test in a lab so<br>one of the key points of all this is<br>that we're studying this big data and<br>genomes and how genes are used because<br>lots of minut alterations to the DNA and<br>how much each D each gene is used the<br>RNA is what underlies disease or at<br>least perpetuates disease or can form a<br>kind of a marker to help us understand<br>and classify and choose better treatment<br>for disease this is a photo of Leroy<br>hood who's a friend of the University of<br>Auckland where he came and gave some<br>talks here with the bioinformatics<br>Institute a couple of years ago he's<br>been involved when the school of<br>Biological Sciences previously but in<br>his real life he actually developed many<br>of the gene sequencing technologies that<br>we use today and a quote from Lee<br>Hoarders that medicines going to become<br>an information science in ten years or<br>so we will have billions of data points<br>for each individual and this was in 2010<br>like many quotes from him and people<br>maybe it's a wee bit ambitious but I'm<br>not sure let let's wait and see Deborah<br>bright and arond Mary and sit and Rob<br>McNeill and I collaborated in 2011 into<br>a survey of many of New Zealand's cancer<br>specialists and the overwhelming<br>response over 90% was that the frequency<br>of use of what they call decision<br>support tools helping decisions based on<br>data and of molecular tests and cancer<br>would increase in ten years and the<br>influence on clinical decisions would<br>increase and this is great and it's<br>great excitement around the field about<br>this but this survey results still<br>worries me a wee bit because we're not<br>doing nearly enough work to determine<br>whether really what we can do with these<br>mathematical models and with all this<br>gene sequencing can chain<br>the outcome for patients and obviously<br>that is the core it's no good<br>imagining we've got a really good test<br>or a really good way to make better<br>clinical decisions when it makes things<br>worse or when we haven't really trialed<br>it of course but with all these cautions<br>in mind there are some mess of studies<br>around the world using the technologies<br>have told you about some of these<br>studies are really interesting cuz they<br>don't focus on disease they focus on the<br>concept of wellness how are those of us<br>who get to age 40 or 50 without major<br>diseases different from those of us who<br>suffer major diseases at a young age for<br>example here's an is a couple of<br>examples of these professor Leroy hood<br>have I mentioned on the previous slide<br>in his systems biology Institute in<br>Seattle has huge projects where he's<br>sequencing the genomes of up to a<br>hundred thousand people and having them<br>record a lot of information about their<br>daily lives to try and determine the<br>interactions between genomes and what<br>goes on in your life and fiction's how<br>much physical activity you do how much<br>stress you have what is your nutrition<br>and so on another example the research<br>arm of Google Google X is collaborating<br>with a variety of US universities to do<br>a very similar study there is a mess of<br>program in England genomics England<br>sorry this hasn't predicted very well<br>which is a company set up by the UK<br>Department of Health to investigate the<br>use of genomics to start to better<br>direct treatment in England in the field<br>of cancer of course our area of research<br>here cancer is fundamentally a disease<br>which is either driven by or is<br>accompanied by changes to the use of<br>genes or mutations to genes there's a<br>massive project called the Cancer Genome<br>Atlas which has recently finished where<br>around the world over 11,000 patients<br>with over 33 different cancer types had<br>their tumors that they kindly donated to<br>the study analyzed in a whole<br>of different ways so the technologies<br>are amazing we can do incredible things<br>big investment around the world and<br>these technologies but we are still<br>limited by a very simple thing and that<br>is our relative lack of understanding of<br>how diseases work we haven't solved<br>disease each year there's dramatic<br>changes in our understanding of disease<br>in normal function but we have a massive<br>way to go before we can utilize all of<br>the genomic data we can produce to do<br>really useful things another aspect of<br>this that I personally feel very<br>conscious about and keeps me awake at<br>night sometimes to be honest is the<br>responsibility when patients donate<br>tissues for research especially we have<br>a massive responsibility to do that well<br>and it would be so easy for things to<br>slip one of the most interesting<br>engagements I've personally had as part<br>of my research Junior over the last few<br>years has been in talking increasingly<br>to Maori leaders in research often I<br>found that some of the principles of T<br>calamari in research especially research<br>around tissue and genomics seem<br>eminently sensible to me to apply to<br>myself and to apply to the whole<br>population we have a massive amount to<br>learn from these principles what are the<br>principles that I think we're thinking<br>about more and more as is our DX DNA<br>actually Elst a sequence or does it<br>partly belong to our children and their<br>ancestors the idea of how exactly do we<br>do consent this consents simply signing<br>away on a form saying your tissue can be<br>used for research or is a consent a<br>dynamic conversation where you expect<br>some reciprocation back you're giving a<br>gift of that tissue what do you expect<br>back from the gift probably it's<br>realistic and right to expect something<br>back if possible even if it's just<br>information about how the tissue you<br>have donated is<br>helping others through research so<br>that's a brief introduction to the types<br>of things that I love and research I'm<br>now going to talk about briefly about a<br>couple of decades of scientific<br>adventures only picking out real<br>highlights please bear in mind as I go<br>through this that this is all about that<br>Paul dunk video I showed before it's all<br>about quietly performing teams I've got<br>to skim through this pretty quickly for<br>me the beginning game when I was a very<br>cool dude age 16 and I got fascinated<br>and really turned on to research by an<br>amazing teacher Thanh Makai at my school<br>who persuaded me to stop my<br>cross-country running for a little while<br>and start to determine what would be an<br>interesting question that I could ask as<br>part of a science project and the<br>question I came up with with a lot of<br>help from dawn was how does URI as<br>enzymes in Clover work at that point for<br>some reason I was very interested in<br>agriculture I was fascinated with how<br>grasslands grow as a bit of an odd thing<br>for a 16 year old I was amazed at the<br>synergy between different plants and<br>clover rye grass pastures when you apply<br>urea fertilizer to these pastures there<br>is induction of or tuning on the enzyme<br>urease which breaks down this urea<br>fertilizer by clover so I did a science<br>project to try and understand their I<br>was really lucky and I got to go to our<br>national science project I met the Queen<br>and Dunedin Museum which was I think it<br>was a highl I don't think I quite<br>recognized that at the time I was lucky<br>enough to get into medical school after<br>that and after a great period of medical<br>school and a few adventures doing<br>pre-hospital emergency care in the UK<br>that's me hanging underneath them RAF<br>helicopter landing on an oil rig in the<br>North Sea I came back to the real world<br>and my first real taste of proper<br>research was with Professor Jim<br>sure and Jim kindly took me on for two<br>and a half months I took two and a half<br>months off before I got married and<br>worked with Jim to research and write a<br>review article on post blank to me<br>sepsis and I just loved this experience<br>research and I suddenly realized that I<br>didn't really want to be in a surgical<br>training program I wanted to be a<br>researcher during my house-surgeon years<br>I worked with Malcolm Sears and Robin<br>Taylor in Dunedin and started to work<br>with them while I was a respiratory<br>house surgeon researching the area of<br>how often should you take inhaled<br>beta-agonists drugs and ESMA I don't<br>know if what's fortunate or not we used<br>to drive called for not a role which was<br>a very active drug that may have given<br>us results that were a little bit at<br>odds with some of the other beta to<br>eight miss drugs that we use today but<br>nevertheless we got a lance of paper out<br>of it and it seemed to me that research<br>was easy and fun that was until I came<br>and did a PhD I was very lucky because I<br>had two fabulous supervisors Jim Watson<br>who was one of the doyen --zz of New<br>Zealand science and me and I positively<br>worship Jeff Kristensen who say Lee<br>can't be here today Jeff's just retired<br>and he's on a trip around England who<br>was my wonderful primary supervisor<br>knighted a PhD trying to understand how<br>different molecules turn on T cells or T<br>lymphocytes many of the people senior<br>people here today were around the same<br>time in the department of molecular<br>medicine where I did my PhD I was trying<br>to do quite a complex thing in my PhD I<br>isolated proteins from the surface of<br>these t lymphocytes that I thought may<br>be involved in turning these lymphocytes<br>on or making them function I made<br>antibodies to these proteins and I did<br>what's called screening expression<br>library where the human DNA is cut up<br>just like you would for sequencing but<br>the proteins are expressed or made from<br>each of the fragments of the DNA on<br>these big plates and they're made in<br>viruses that themselves live in bacteria<br>nylon filters on these plates were<br>peeled off to try and identify what is<br>the sequence of the DNA that encode<br>protein that I'd isolated from the<br>surface of the cells and in the end<br>through lots of old-fashioned DNA<br>sequencing I was one of the last people<br>I think one of the last generations to<br>clone my own gene or just discover a<br>gene before other people had and that<br>gene turned out to be called connectin<br>it had nothing to do with healthy<br>lymphocytes function as far as we know<br>unfortunately but it was still a useful<br>finding and it was a wonderful journey I<br>then had four years in Melbourne and the<br>Walter and Eliza Hall Institute<br>extremely lucky to be supervised by<br>Suzanne Khoury who was the Institute's<br>director and Gerry Adams while I was<br>there I fell in love with a phenomena in<br>biology called programmed cell death or<br>apoptosis<br>you may not realize that those of you<br>who are not scientists but our cells are<br>very utilitarian in the John Stuart Mill<br>sense of the word our cells will commit<br>suicide when they no longer required<br>when they're infected when this surplus<br>to what's needed during development when<br>they're in the way of a tissue being<br>remodeled and the suicide process is<br>called apoptosis and the way up toxic<br>opa ptosis works is that the cells have<br>this complex program of proteins called<br>kes phases and these are enzymes rather<br>like the enzymes that get your washing<br>clean that will chew up the cell from<br>the inside out<br>they'll dismantle the membranes of the<br>cell they'll dismantle the DNA and this<br>is a video I made when I was you know<br>several years ago when I was working<br>these are actually cells that line blood<br>vessels called endothelial cells and<br>there's one there there's another one up<br>here and this was a time lapse video<br>spend up about a hundred and fifty times<br>of these cells dying by apoptosis you<br>can see them flowing up throwing off<br>this little membrane-bound vesicles this<br>little almost like silk coffins which<br>then get taken away and reprocessed it's<br>a amazing process widows arrived in<br>Melbourne they've just discovered a new<br>gene themselves like I had with the<br>connecting gene in New Zealand they<br>discovered a gene called B CL double<br>it was a member of a family of genes<br>that regulates this process of apoptosis<br>and my job was to work out how B co W<br>worked I did that by using genetic<br>modification technologies to knock out<br>the gene in mice<br>so I generated mice that didn't have B<br>seal W I then spent the next two years<br>trying to work out what on earth it did<br>there was some of the hardest here's my<br>life because the mice obviously didn't<br>have anything at all wrong with them but<br>I learned a massive amount of pathology<br>and histology working in death labs<br>going through tissue tissue after tissue<br>trying to see what was wrong until<br>suddenly I realized that these mice<br>wouldn't breed when we looked in the<br>epididymis of these mice where sperm is<br>stored after it's been made in the<br>testes in normal mice you can see all<br>this little sperm here and these mice<br>the tubules of the epididymis were<br>completely empty of sperm the mice were<br>azoospermia we then went back and we<br>found out that the reason for this is<br>that there was suicide of the developing<br>sperm cells and the testes of these mice<br>this was pretty much all that was wrong<br>with these mice but there was a<br>fantastic finding because it then let me<br>work with Kate Loveland and David de<br>Kritzer who later became premier of<br>Victoria in Australia to understand how<br>the entire process of apoptosis in the<br>beasts or to family contribute to the<br>development of sperm and that was a<br>fantastic period for me one of the<br>amazing things was when you use special<br>stains to identify cells that are<br>committing suicide in the testes you see<br>these balls of cells these are called<br>symplast s-- and what it turns out they<br>are is that they're balls of cells that<br>divided from a single parental cell and<br>they linked together what happens we<br>found in the test is's unlike normal<br>division of cells as tissues grow the<br>cells don't divide and separate off they<br>remain linked together by this little<br>cytoplasmic bridges<br>so these simplest s-- were all dying on<br>this<br>so a wonderful period of time in<br>Melbourne following that I went to<br>Cambridge and I had a another fabulous<br>period but in a very different<br>environment it's it's the most wonderful<br>environment where you can go to lunch<br>and sit down next to a Nobel laureate or<br>one of your scientific heroes when I<br>first arrived in Cambridge I was pretty<br>much fresh off the boat I think and I<br>remember Sir Brian heap the master of<br>sand Edmonds College ringing me up in<br>the lab asking if I'd like to go and<br>take sherry with him and I was rather<br>taken aback by the call I hadn't met Sir<br>Brian before and I called him mate and I<br>don't think he's ever forgotten that I<br>think I said that would be great mate<br>but luckily he he forgave me and he was<br>a wonderful relaxed Christian gentleman<br>who was also one of the preeminent<br>researchers who did a lot of research<br>into reproductive biology in what's now<br>known as the bay Broome Institute in<br>Cambridge when I was there I chose to<br>work with the man who named this process<br>of apoptosis or cell death Andrew Wiley<br>a pathologist Steve Smith who's a now a<br>great friend and collaborator and Steve<br>Charlotte Jones Steve Smith's now Dean<br>of the Medical School of Melbourne and<br>Steve Charlotte Jones is the professor<br>of reproductive biology in Cambridge now<br>I wanted to determine whether this<br>process of apoptosis was important as<br>blood vessels develop in embryos<br>once again I used genetic modification I<br>made some zygotes or the earliest cells<br>or Blastoise or so should say some of<br>the earliest cells of mice that lect a<br>ability to die by apoptosis when I did<br>that the mice never got to booth they'd<br>be stillborn and when I looked very<br>carefully<br>the mice had all these balls of extra<br>cells and all these extra blood vessels<br>that should have been removed during<br>development but we're not removed a lot<br>of this work was done by a fabulous<br>postdoc called Ellen Duvall from France<br>the other really exciting thing though<br>is that when we looked at the<br>development of tissues look at this<br>mouse here it's got webbed feet normally<br>the process of apoptosis is required to<br>remove the bridges between our fingers<br>this didn't happen the blood vessel<br>seemed to need to regress in order for<br>the whole tissues to regress during<br>development so that lead to asking the<br>question we know about all the proteins<br>involved in apoptosis and we know that<br>the Safa ptosis of these blood vessel<br>cells endothelial cells is important but<br>is DNA and changes to how genes are<br>expressed also important for apoptosis<br>so what we did was we took some of these<br>blood vessel lining cells called<br>endothelial cells and in the laboratory<br>we grew them in incubators and we caused<br>them to die by apoptosis by tricking<br>them into committing suicide then we<br>followed the usage or expression of all<br>the genes in the genome across time and<br>we saw various patterns of change of<br>these genes and when we looked very<br>carefully we realized that actually this<br>apoptosis program is driven by or at<br>least assisted by changes in a whole<br>range of different genes<br>there are even induction de novo from no<br>expression to strong aspiration of<br>signals that bring in cells that will<br>eat up the little membrane bound bleeds<br>that I showed you in that video when<br>cells commit suicide that's like someone<br>phoning the Undertaker to take their<br>body away before they commit suicide<br>there are a multitude of other changes<br>the cells change the gene expression to<br>go out of the cell cycle they stop<br>dividing<br>they change the gene expression to<br>reduce any energy expensive process so<br>all the energy can be used to commit<br>suicide based on that work we realized<br>that there was a real commercial<br>opportunity to use the sort of genetic<br>analysis technology to help drug<br>companies fail their drugs early and<br>that seems like a bit of a funny idea<br>failing drugs early but of course a lot<br>of expense from drug companies as<br>generated as drugs gets so far down the<br>pipeline and then do not get carried<br>forward so we set up a company a group<br>of seven other people with me just one<br>part of a very big team<br>or DNA or genetics international we had<br>some fantastic luck with this company<br>but also a huge learning curve and<br>eventually this company succeeded came<br>back to Auckland in 2005 with my family<br>after precisely ten years almost to the<br>day overseas and I was lucky to be able<br>to over the years work with an amazing<br>set of people here and many of you can<br>see photos that you probably think are<br>awful photos and I'm sorry about that it<br>was the best I could get from the web<br>this is a photo of one of our group<br>retreats a couple of years ago at<br>Elberton one of the things that we've<br>been doing in Auckland is building tours<br>and you probably think we'll building<br>tools that's engineering that's not<br>really science and I agree it is<br>engineering but I see a very important<br>and core role of people doing<br>bioinformatics building mathematical and<br>statistical computational tools to<br>better understand big data or to better<br>distill information from masses of data<br>that are generated from genomics here's<br>one example of a tool for gene network<br>inference for understanding how<br>different genes and their correlations<br>or interactions can tell us a little bit<br>about the relationship between signal<br>molecules and cells and this was<br>published in nucleic acids research a<br>couple of years ago and that the team<br>involved Daniel Hurley nip and cram<br>penis at the core drivers or another<br>example is a project that involved in<br>eat'em of the Kara pen Andrew shilling<br>and Daniel Hurley to understand how<br>genes and the protein say encode can<br>relate to one another in breast cancer<br>and further work on this project from<br>any glacier who<br>is one of the main principal<br>investigators within our broader<br>collaborative group found that as part<br>of these gene networks there was one<br>gene that was related or linked to large<br>numbers of other genes that all did the<br>same thing this was a gene called yb1<br>and it was linked to large numbers of<br>other genes that had their expression<br>turned on by a particular transcription<br>factor called e 2 F 1 and it and Anthony<br>Braithwaite and a large number of other<br>people worked together to find how this<br>particular yb1 protein seems to act as a<br>cofactor for these e 2 if transcription<br>factors and as part of that we also<br>discovered that often this Y B 1 protein<br>is expressed at very high levels in the<br>same tumors that have expression at very<br>high levels of a number of other genes<br>in the same chromosomal location and I<br>was dumb enough to take ages to work<br>this out<br>what was going on is that there is a<br>region of the chromosome in which this Y<br>B 1 gene sets that is amplified in a<br>proportion of breast tumors and by being<br>amplified I mean there's just lots of<br>extra copies of this chromosomal region<br>and this is why all of these genes seem<br>to be linked together because when<br>there's extra copies the genes are used<br>more than there's more of the gene more<br>of the protein or together and a B<br>jeolban our laboratory is now trying to<br>work out what are the mechanisms for the<br>amplification of this gene we found that<br>this gene is amplified in a whole range<br>of different tumors as well as breast<br>cancer and as a wonderful follow-on from<br>this project Ming Wei Wang and China is<br>working with Anthony Braithwaite Peter<br>Shepard in it Alix Traver on to try and<br>develop try and identify drug compounds<br>that could be used to drug this very<br>important alga gene in cancer<br>a lot of this molecular pathway research<br>has involved Sonali Mita and Deborah<br>right I'm not going to really talk about<br>the molecular pathway research which was<br>very significant I want to talk about<br>something that I think some bigger story<br>from them one of the things that we've<br>found as we work through using Bank<br>tissue bank tissues these are tissues<br>that have been donated kindly from<br>patients for research and we can take<br>these tissues out of a tissue bank with<br>ethical approval and use them to<br>understand the genetic relationships<br>between the tissues and disease we we go<br>to no end of trouble to get all the<br>molecular data right but we found all<br>the clinical data stored in the tissue<br>beings associated with them was very<br>dodgy and we realized that that's now a<br>major problem certainly in breast cancer<br>and colon cancer we're very lucky that<br>we have researchers that like Lance<br>Miller and Mick Black and John McColl<br>who have worked very hard to get great<br>clinical annotation and clinical<br>information as a context against which<br>we can interpret molecular information<br>but through a lot of tissue around the<br>world that's used in a research there<br>was very poor quality clinical<br>information which severely limits<br>gaining information or insights about<br>the linkages between genes and disease I<br>mentioned to you before this idea of<br>understanding molecular pathways and how<br>different proteins work and signaling<br>pathways and the genes that encode those<br>proteins work together one of the tools<br>we produced an engineering project from<br>Christoph Knapp and this is how his<br>photo appears on the web it's not a<br>sprint he's a very modest guy<br>Christoph's actually a pastry chef by<br>training who is bright enough to also be<br>a bioinformatician mitsuo rocky a<br>postdoctoral fellow from Japan generated<br>with Christoph a tall called gene set DB<br>to try and analyze these molecular<br>pathways arond marrying macclare and a<br>fabulous statistician in<br>the group McNaughton and now developing<br>much better statistical methods to<br>understand how information about<br>molecular pathways can be extracted from<br>genomic data using one of these methods<br>we've worked with Nancy Jenkins and Neil<br>Copeland in the Methodist Medical Center<br>in Houston we're very lucky to be<br>invited into the project doctormick<br>black from o Targo and i working with<br>michael men and luckily this year we<br>managed to with them get a nature<br>genetics paper using some of the pathway<br>analysis methods to understand how<br>different genes synergize in the<br>development of melanoma and as part of<br>that project elextra Vartan here again<br>worked with a local company that<br>visualized developed a visualization<br>software for genetics called bio matters<br>and alex has worked with bio matters to<br>develop a wonderful tool where we've<br>analyzed over 300 exome or genome<br>sequences from patients with melanoma to<br>try and determine what are the clusters<br>or characteristics of the patients and<br>how could potential drugs that are used<br>for other purposes perhaps be used to<br>inhibit molecular pathways in melanoma<br>another example is work on the eastern<br>receptor and this again involves an<br>eat'em of the Kara pen but also one of<br>my oppose that I see is almost a role<br>model and mentor dr. Andrew shilling got<br>an incredibly fortunate to work with and<br>they they say the cream always<br>percolates to the top of the milk that<br>and Andrew has certainly percolated to<br>the top being our soceity research<br>andrew is a fabulous balancing influence<br>on me he brings me down to earth with my<br>bio and phonetic ideas and one of the<br>things that andrew has worked with us to<br>do is to help us apply these ideas to<br>understanding how we look at molecular<br>pathways induced by estrogen and breast<br>cancer a proportion of patients with<br>breast cancer have their tumor cells<br>addicted to East region estrogen is<br>required for these tumor cells to grow<br>there are drugs that can be used to<br>target the tumor cells of these patients<br>tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors and<br>what we've done is analyzed the<br>molecular pathways through a lot of hard<br>work from an eater a lot of insight from<br>Andrew to identify sets of genes that<br>can better predict which patients we<br>hope we to predict which patients may<br>potentially respond to these drugs or at<br>least to better understand the molecular<br>pathways that underlie this form of<br>cancer we've also used the sort of<br>method with lambing Meehan RA and<br>Li Wang to look at the complex<br>interaction and tumors between the cells<br>of the tumor and normal cells but I<br>wanted to end up on what I see is right<br>now my most exciting project I've ever<br>been involved in very lucky to be<br>working with Kate Parker Mike Finlay and<br>especially Ben Lawrence in a project<br>that's a multi-modal project to really<br>target one type of human cancer at great<br>depth this is a sort of cancer called<br>neuro endocrine neoplasia and Ben and<br>others have developed methods for<br>developing multidisciplinary meetings<br>across the country where clinicians can<br>share their growing knowledge and we<br>hope to contribute to that knowledge by<br>understanding the genomics that underlie<br>these tumors Kate Parker has worked with<br>people around the country to develop a<br>register of these patients and we're<br>developing our own ethically approved<br>tissue bank where patients of kindly<br>donated tissue to this research we're<br>doing genomic analysis of these tissues<br>and working with pathologists to try and<br>see how the genomes and the pathology<br>work with the clinical information about<br>these tissues to better understand the<br>disease and hopefully to start to<br>stratify therapies for these patients<br>this is a slider borrowed from being<br>Lauren's it's really about the project<br>trying to move from the current type of<br>drug trial or evaluation where a gold<br>standard current way of treating is<br>compared to adding on an extra way of<br>treating to a much more multimodal a<br>motor way to direct therapy<br>where you identify a genomic event you<br>identify whether they're a corroborating<br>events to reduce the chance of false<br>discovery and is there a drug that could<br>target that event very quickly one<br>example of a patient with a large<br>neuroendocrine tumor this is the<br>pathology of the tumor we've been able<br>to do whole genome sequencing and tired<br>of genome sequencing with Sandra<br>Fitzgerald sherry blank Owen Paulus<br>shields and several others in the group<br>have developed ways of getting very deep<br>sequence from both the tumors and the<br>metastasis this is normal tissue from a<br>patient this is the primary tumor where<br>the tumor started and these are two<br>metastases or parts of the tumor that<br>have moved out from the tumor and this<br>is identifying new mutations an<br>important cancer gene called a TRX in<br>the metastasis of the tumor that weren't<br>there in the primary tumor the idea of<br>looking for what's called aneuploidy or<br>extra copies of chromosomes or parts of<br>chromosomes this is work that's being<br>done by sonali mater and thames and rob<br>to try and see why these tumors have so<br>many extra copies or losses of copies of<br>chromosomes we're also interested in the<br>immune system and that seems to play a<br>role in the proportion of these cancers<br>there are small lymph node like<br>structures and there are lymphocytes<br>that come into these tumors and when we<br>look at how the RNA or the genes are<br>expressed in these tumors we see lots of<br>genes expressed from lymphocytes and<br>presumably from the tumor cells<br>themselves that bring the lymphocytes in<br>we've been able to look at special types<br>of molecules called micro RNAs that are<br>regulatory RNAs and at processes called<br>methylation where genes are turned on or<br>off by adding methyl residues to the<br>start of the gene and by using those<br>processes this is an example in one<br>patient we've been able to identify a<br>loss of an off switch so the off switch<br>is lost for a very important gene called<br>mTOR and this raises the possibility<br>could this patient be treated with an<br>drug inhibitors of mTOR such as ever<br>anima s' because the level of the same<br>tor<br>mission is higher in this patient and we<br>hope that one day we will be able to<br>look at large numbers of these neuro<br>endocrine tumors as well as other tumor<br>types maybe even playing chess with the<br>tumors to identify how resistance to<br>drugs develops by using genomics many<br>other people in the Ortolan medical<br>school and around the world of course<br>are doing this type of research but we<br>have a real critical mess here now with<br>investigators such as Stefan Bohlander<br>who gave an inaugural lecture earlier at<br>this year so I just wanted to end up in<br>the last five minutes to comment on why<br>New Zealand remains a great place to do<br>research we're always struggling for<br>funding we're always struggling for<br>space and for good students and often<br>it's easy to feel that all you ever hear<br>is negativity but I've worked in several<br>places Japan Australia little times in<br>the US and little times in Poland and in<br>Britain and I've never found a place<br>with a more collaborative research<br>culture that I enjoy doing research in<br>more than New Zealand here's a few<br>reasons for them first of all we have<br>the bioinformatics Institute which I<br>think is the most fabulous thing for a<br>university to have we have people like<br>Kelly sitting up here in the audience<br>who is a PhD scientist who is spending<br>her time managing the biomedics<br>Institute we have a whole range of<br>skilled bioinformaticians these people<br>are going to be the future of this whole<br>science of genomics I'm talking about<br>the marketing people talk about the<br>global market for genomics being twenty<br>two billion dollars by the year 2020 a<br>ten percent growth each year they say<br>the fastest-growing place for genomics<br>and bioinformatics will be the<br>asia-pacific region and the<br>fastest-growing sector will be this<br>personalized medicine so they claim<br>bioinformatics or taking the genomic<br>data and distilling information out of<br>it is also interesting here's a<br>wonderful quote today's by Owen from met<br>assists or by informaticians are in for<br>a real treat or seemingly endless stream<br>of biological data being generated<br>across sectors is a high demand for<br>talented experienced professionals this<br>is difficult though because these people<br>right now don't really have a career<br>path<br>often they thought of as technical<br>engineers who are incredibly screwed at<br>data analysis but they're not research<br>scientists but a number that people who<br>work in our bioinformatics Institute<br>really understand the biology they've<br>done degrees in the biology they can<br>cross the fields from experimental<br>science to analyzing the data they're<br>the people that are going to be most<br>valuable it's wonderful when the journal<br>Nature has a headline reward<br>bioinformaticians<br>you really know that the field is<br>starting to arrive in New Zealand to do<br>by genetics and genomics the New Zealand<br>government gave a large donation of over<br>40 million dollars to set up and use bio<br>informatics infrastructure called New<br>Zealand genomics limited this hemp to<br>work in a slightly clunky administrative<br>way due to the way it was set up but<br>nevertheless it has conducted hundreds<br>of research projects which have been<br>very effective and I do hope this<br>continues we have groups like the New<br>Zealand Society for oncology we have<br>been Lawrence is going to take over as<br>chair next year and do great things for<br>that this is a fantastic society that<br>was generated almost 50 years ago to<br>allow our collaboration between<br>clinicians and the cancer field and<br>cancer scientists we have our Queenstown<br>meetings and a person I'm so proud to be<br>associated and work with Peter Shephard<br>Peter drives these annual meetings that<br>bring together many of New Zealand's<br>molecular scientists in one place<br>they're growing year after year national<br>science challenges we have a National<br>Science Challenge three that I'm on the<br>science leadership team along with<br>several other people in this faculty and<br>one part of that challenge is going to<br>be sequencing the blood of colon cancer<br>and melanoma patients to try and develop<br>ways to detect mutations from tumors<br>early and we've already done a little<br>bit of work from Cherie Blair colon and<br>Sandra Fitzgerald and an election and<br>several others influenced an animator in<br>my group we have the Maurice Walken<br>Center a national collaborative where<br>I'm a PI and we're number of people in<br>this Faculty of principle investigators<br>which is an incredibly powerful<br>group to drive translational research we<br>also have New Zealand strong focus on<br>ethics and on understanding how patient<br>participation is important in research<br>peri Guildford a collaborator of miners<br>probably our poster boy in that perry<br>has done the most incredible things<br>working closely with marty to identify<br>mutations in cat hair and genes that can<br>predispose to cancer so we often talk in<br>New Zealand about the idea of<br>translational bridges translating our<br>findings from the research I've been<br>talking about into the clinic and if you<br>look at a development in melbourne<br>that's a real aspiration for mine the<br>victorian comprehensive cancer center<br>over here on the right is the raw<br>Melbourne Hospital in the water lies a<br>hall Institute where I spent four years<br>and this is a new building that's going<br>up and it's actually got I think two<br>bridges across to the hospital in the<br>research place now we don't have a<br>translational bridge we've got a tunnel<br>but despite that we have one thing that<br>the tunnel demonstrates very well and<br>that is innovation the tunnel leaks<br>terribly it's got all the underwater<br>heating pipes going through and this is<br>a real example of number 8 wire keyway<br>ingenuity of which I'm so proud to be in<br>New Zealand here is a leaking pipe a<br>rubbish bin under it to catch the big<br>leaks but we've got a funnel and a hose<br>that runs down to a drain but putting it<br>seriously that's the sort of Kiwi<br>innovation that I think we do incredibly<br>well that is why we punch above our<br>weight the fact that we've got a tunnel<br>doesn't matter one iota we also have a<br>very well supported academic alliance in<br>Auckland and this is the sort of thing<br>that makes me want to really stay in<br>Auckland and do research this is largely<br>driven by John Fraser and Megan Patrol<br>it's got a future of a integrated Cancer<br>Center we have a lot of future genomic<br>initiatives in this and as part of this<br>and as centre of this we have an<br>Auckland regional tissue bank where<br>patients can give under ethical approval<br>tissues for research we have a training<br>scheme now where registrar's every year<br>medical registrar's with path<br>registrar's can come across from the<br>hospital and engage in research and the<br>current person is Nicole Cramer a<br>pathologist who's working with my<br>research group with Ben Lawrence this is<br>Brian McMath who is chair of the<br>Newmarket rotary trusts who has very<br>kindly been funding these so I have had<br>a incredibly exciting journey from a<br>nerdy 16 year old investigating clover<br>rye grass pastures to being privileged<br>to work with some amazing people and<br>have enough funding to analyze genomes<br>with the hope that one day I can be part<br>of this tripartite treatment of patients<br>that traditional medical acumen the<br>traditional pathology in the genomics<br>certainly it's really exciting times<br>when you can hold a sequencing machine<br>it gives me great pleasure to be able to<br>thank Chris tonight for your wonderful<br>inaugural lecture I'm Kathy Crozier and<br>I'm representing the department of<br>molecular medicine and pathology our<br>head of department Peter brow at<br>unfortunately couldn't be here and this<br>evening is terribly disappointed to be<br>missing us and you know wanted to convey<br>his best wishes and congratulations to<br>you these are such great events that's<br>lovely to see Adele and the family here<br>and to learn of the variety of<br>experiences that you have had that have<br>shaped the current work that you're<br>doing in the university well I first<br>heard of Chris when I was actually<br>returning to the University from a<br>period overseas and I remember Jim<br>Watson telling me but he was very<br>excited about this some PhD student that<br>was about to start and so I've really<br>followed and Chris's career with a lot<br>of interest over the years as he's<br>passed through the whole Institute and<br>and in Cambridge and we were just so<br>delighted when we learned that you were<br>interested and coming back to Auckland<br>which is now sort of about 10 years ago<br>and I've really enjoyed working with<br>kresson both teaching and research I<br>mean I think many in the audience would<br>agree with me that Chris is incredibly<br>positive giving friendly and hardworking<br>colleague and I'd like to note that that<br>actually translates into a culture I<br>think that permeates your land and I<br>think all the individuals in your lab<br>are just so great the way they're so<br>cheerfully what to engage when we want<br>them to help with something in the<br>department or with or with teaching I<br>think you've provided great support for<br>the reinvigorated medical program<br>particularly being a champion of the<br>clinical scenarios and fostering<br>research opportunities for our students<br>and you've always got time for the<br>students you know and teaching the<br>pathology and the genetics and I know<br>they respect you high-lead for that so<br>I'm a hematologist and this morning I<br>actually spent time with the patient<br>his wife who's just been diagnosed with<br>acute leukemia and one of the important<br>parts of our discussion this morning was<br>actually that with the bone marrow that<br>he had taken this morning that the<br>molecular genetic test that we do on<br>that marrow are going to shape our<br>decisions about what sort of treatment<br>he's going to have and so I just really<br>thought that was a very good example of<br>how the things that chris has talked<br>about and just prospects for the future<br>in a number of areas they are now the<br>reality for us as clinicians and and<br>managing our patients and really going<br>to make a real difference so Chris has<br>really been at the forefront I think<br>have been shoring that New Zealand is<br>well positioned to be a part of<br>capturing the opportunities of jadhav<br>genomic analysis not only for in the<br>clinic quite also purely enhancing our<br>fundamental biomedical research which of<br>course is also so important so Chris the<br>University is very fortunate to have you<br>in our midst and it's now very<br>deservedly as a professor so<br>congratulations Thank You Kathy for some<br>lovely closing remarks and thank you for<br>the introduction and before I formally<br>draw this inaugural lecture to a close<br>I'd like to just add my comments as Dean<br>I actually go back quite some way with<br>Chris we used to go running when he was<br>a PhD student and I was a fresh paw stop<br>and in molecular medicine 15 20 years on<br>maybe it's even more than eight<br>I can't think of anybody who's made more<br>of a contribution to this faculty right<br>across the continuum not only in<br>research but teaching and service<br>chris is one of those stars that we have<br>and I'd particularly like to remind<br>Chris that one of the most important<br>contributions he ever made to my career<br>was one day he walked into there and I<br>had a computer on my desk and he at that<br>stage I think we just connected it to<br>the Internet pretty newfangled thing and<br>I knew nothing about the intent of<br>course Chris and his typical wisdom you<br>all about the internet and he loaded up<br>a a program I can't even read it was<br>caught it wasn't Netscape this one<br>before Netscape and we he typed in a<br>euro URL to Nessa we watched the comet<br>shoemaker-levy crashed into Jupiter it<br>was my first experience of the world<br>wide web and the Internet and of course<br>as we all know the rest is history but<br>it's typical of Chris that he knew all<br>about this before anybody else did and<br>he also had the time and wisdom to stop<br>and show me all about it and I was<br>awestruck by it so I think that just<br>sort of speaks to the type of person<br>that Chris is so I'd like to offer my<br>personal congratulations and the also<br>like to reiterate with Kathy that we<br>were delighted we made the decision to<br>return to New Zealand and the support<br>you've given to people I hope has been<br>returned and the support we provided to<br>you so congratulations again I'm a<br>wonderful seminar and thank you all for<br>coming<br>I hope it stopped raining we'll soon<br>find out when we leave so just to remind<br>you that the next renewal lecturers<br>professor Nicola tell Beth and that is<br>next Tuesday it's not Thursday it's next<br>Tuesday so you all very welcome to the<br>team so once again thank you for coming<br>and thank you Chris for a wonderful<br>lecture<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
