and research in two very different settings: New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my introduction I'm John Fraser the Dean<br>of the Faculty of medical and health<br>sciences and it's a pleasure to have you<br>all here tonight the inaugural lecture<br>series are a big event in our academic<br>calendar so this is our second of our<br>inaugural series for 2015 and as I've<br>said inaugural lectures are definitely<br>one of the highlights of our academic<br>calendar and this year we have a record<br>seven new professors presenting over the<br>coming four weeks our first inaugural<br>lecture was last night within civil so<br>if they just a brief introduction<br>inaugural lectures are in fact a very<br>old tradition and universities and they<br>actually date back to medieval times<br>those in those times universities were<br>traditionally just groups of professors<br>they were recruited into an elite<br>Brotherhood that supported and protected<br>each other they lived and cloistered<br>surroundings away from the real world<br>they answered only to themselves and to<br>the esoteric interests while of course<br>expecting at the same time to be<br>handsomely remunerated for just being<br>smarter than everybody else I'll leave<br>it to you to decide whether things have<br>changed that much all joking aside<br>inaugural lectures are a very important<br>tradition and they haven't changed in<br>many many years they are in fact our<br>public announcement of our new<br>professors they are a means of<br>showcasing our most eminent staff and a<br>celebration of an event that often<br>represents the pinnacle of one's<br>academic career elevation to the title<br>of professor is not something that has<br>taken lightly in academia the process of<br>selection is long and involved and<br>requires intense scrutiny by<br>international peers who then confirm to<br>the University that the appointee has<br>reached status of international<br>reputation and imminence thus giving<br>them the license to say anything they<br>like about this subject hoping that<br>people will believe what they say<br>inaugural lectures are also a wonderful<br>opportunity for colleagues family and<br>friends to learn about the journey that<br>has led to the academics<br>access the milestones the decisions and<br>most importantly the mentors who have<br>assisted along away tonight is my very<br>great pleasure to introduce professor<br>chris bullen and i'd like to invite<br>tonari curse the head of school of<br>population health to provide some<br>introductory remarks thank you delicato<br>tena koutou tena koutou katoa this is a<br>great privilege for me as this as the<br>head of the school of population health<br>to introduce Chris and to welcome you to<br>the school of population health here at<br>Tamaki it'll be interesting to see how<br>many more of these we have out here<br>before we go on our move but to talk<br>about Chris Chris's mum welcome to<br>chris's mummys here tonight where is she<br>now up the back good place to be so in<br>Chris's immediate family wife kids<br>excellent thank you very much for coming<br>and welcome to chris's world i'm sure<br>you've been here before so Chris was the<br>youngest of three I hear and I tried to<br>get some gin out of his brothers and<br>sister but didn't get much tonight so I<br>can tell you that he graduated in<br>medicine from the university of auckland<br>and he is a real committed citizen his<br>commitment to service and engagement led<br>him to be the district medical officer<br>in Papua New Guinea for eight years and<br>he continues a long-term involvement and<br>development oriented NGOs his service<br>engagement continued to underpin his<br>public health work inside and outside<br>the university so obviously he trained<br>in public health medicine has a PhD in<br>community health and while become one<br>wall incoming relatively late to<br>academia mmm he took on substantial<br>teaching and administrative<br>responsibilities early on and quickly<br>built a really stunning research career<br>he joined the clinical trials unit as it<br>was then in 2003 as a senior research<br>fellow came out here to us to form the<br>school of population health in 2004 and<br>2009 was appointed the director of the<br>then C tau and then transformed into<br>National Institute of Health innovation<br>so Chris continues to lead public health<br>teaching with the undergraduate medical<br>school program he's a fellow of the<br>faculty<br>of public health medicine of the Royal<br>Australian Australasian College of<br>Physicians and a fellow of the New<br>Zealand College of Public Health<br>medicine is a member of the Society for<br>research on nicotine and tobacco and a<br>member of the International Union<br>against TB and lung disease chris is<br>also the chair of the RAC p policy<br>advisory committee and was a board<br>member of the Hart Foundation and<br>chaired the heart foundation's public<br>health strategic advisory group for ten<br>years until late last year so he is an<br>academic star as well as this<br>considerable service that he does his<br>researchers focused primarily I<br>investigating novel smoking cessation<br>interventions here's the king of the<br>e-cigarette and part of the wider<br>research agenda and the prevention and<br>management of non-communicable diseases<br>he's the co-director of the tobacco<br>control research torrent to runner which<br>is a five-million-dollar Health Research<br>Council program grant tackling the hard<br>job of reducing smoking in New Zealand<br>chris has established a number of<br>productive national and international<br>collaborations now I also talk to those<br>who work with Chris and those who work<br>with Chris are very impressed by his<br>decisiveness his calmness under pressure<br>and his great sense of humor I think it<br>bodes us tides us through many things he<br>works very long hours and is hugely<br>dedicated but also somehow balances this<br>with time spent with his family and<br>enjoying his many outside interests he's<br>definitely walking the walk on work-life<br>balance as much as he's able to as a<br>leader Chris the leader is quiet<br>determined inclusive and effect and has<br>a very effective approach which is<br>greatly appreciated by those both above<br>and below him in the pecking order we<br>all appreciate working with someone who<br>commands such respect and as also<br>remains quite a genuine down-to-earth<br>person now for me well when he is a<br>research program involves M&amp;E health so<br>of course I turned to the internet and I<br>found that he's indeed very well known<br>he's got 125 hits on midline and<br>search engine for that's the search<br>engine for academic publications but<br>it's got over four hundred and twenty<br>thousand hits on Google now there's a<br>little program called google internet<br>fight where you put up two terms or two<br>names and then you see who wins and so<br>you'll be pleased very pleased to know<br>that you completely beat Alistair<br>Woodward no recurse and Roberts Craig in<br>this deal so I think we all have to<br>enjoy this talk tonight and Chris very<br>much deserves his promotion to Professor<br>and it gives a great honor for me to<br>introduce to you professor chris bullen<br>p thank you all of you for coming here<br>tonight on a winter's winter's night in<br>Auckland it's my great pleasure to be<br>able to share with you some of the<br>stories the back stories if you like my<br>journey to where I am here tonight and I<br>really want to use this as an<br>opportunity to acknowledge the many<br>people who've helped me along the way so<br>the title of this talk is bugs bedrooms<br>and smoke and my career in public health<br>research and you may wonder we're inner<br>thigh I got that title from well I'm<br>very thrilled with this fruta let you<br>know that I stand in good company with<br>the esteemed Jared Diamond who's<br>something of a polymath and wrote this<br>wonderful book called Guns Germs and<br>Steel so I apologize for sort of lifting<br>the flavor of the title of that great<br>book but we actually have something more<br>than just the title of a book in common<br>and that is that both Jared Diamond and<br>I have a fascination and a great love of<br>a country north of Australia could Papua<br>New Guinea which was very formative in<br>my public health journey and I'll be<br>referring to Papua New Guinea throughout<br>this talk tonight diamond refers to<br>examples from his time in the land of<br>the unexpected to highlight key points<br>throughout his books and yeah i'll be<br>doing the same but he also posits that<br>there are at work wider forces behind<br>people's health than their genetic<br>makeup their individual choices and<br>behavior he talks about environmental<br>factors where people live the geography<br>the climate the microbes and the spread<br>of technology and i'll be making this<br>point throughout my talk as i profess on<br>the topics of bugs bedrooms and smoke so<br>i'll be covering off my journey from<br>clinical medicine to public health<br>practice and research and then we'll be<br>having some thoughts around the future<br>about public health and also about the<br>future where I'm going to go with my<br>energy over the next few years but<br>before we go any further I thought I'd<br>try and answer my mum's repetitive<br>question which is what on earth do you<br>actually do dear and so this is probably<br>the best way to do it is to go back to<br>public health 101 with the very much<br>well known definition of public health<br>as the science and art of preventing<br>disease prolonging life and promoting<br>health through the organized efforts of<br>society and certainly in my mother's<br>case that's all worked rather well<br>because she's going to celebrate her<br>89th birthday in just a few months so we<br>focused in public health on prevention<br>of disease but also the promotion of<br>health and it's not just about medicine<br>and what happens and hospitals are even<br>in primary care clinics it's about<br>weaving together all of society in a<br>coordinated effort to face the public<br>health challenges of our time and one<br>way of thinking about some of the<br>complexities of the environment that<br>we're in is this graphic which I use on<br>the front cover of our population health<br>intensive handbook for year five medical<br>students every year imagine that we're<br>in the center of an onion and there are<br>a whole lot of layers on the outside and<br>these are all factors that have an<br>influence on our health so we carry<br>around with us our age six and<br>hereditary factors but there are<br>lifestyle factors around us and in the<br>social and community and other<br>environmental factors and right out on<br>the outside they're those general<br>socio-economic cultural and<br>environmental conditions that will play<br>a part and you can see that health care<br>is important but it's only one part if<br>you like of the overall public health<br>picture<br>another popular framework used in public<br>health thinking is this idea of strategy<br>of population population health strategy<br>as opposed to focusing on individuals<br>when we focus on populations we are<br>looking at the distribution of risk in<br>populations in this example we can see<br>how blood pressure is distributed<br>through a population and the risk as<br>high up at this end of having a stroke<br>or a heart attack or dying from those<br>events and down here are people at low<br>risk but most people sit in the middle<br>somewhere and population health or<br>public health tries to shift the risk a<br>little bit to the left and it might be<br>through taking a little bit of salt out<br>of our diets to lower our blood<br>pressure's just a little bit and we can<br>have a huge impact at a population level<br>directions and stroke and heart disease<br>by several percentage points just<br>through some of those almost<br>imperceptible measures and another<br>framework which I'll be referring to<br>tonight on a number of occasions is just<br>another way of thinking about the causes<br>of illness and points of intervention we<br>are the hosts a human host there are<br>vectors often that are involved in<br>transmitting an agent that may be<br>noxious in some way or toxic and it all<br>occurs in the context of broader<br>environment it's the interplay between<br>those factors that gives rise to disease<br>and then finally social gradients and<br>health are really important when we<br>think about how health is distributed<br>within countries in between countries we<br>find that just about in every situation<br>is a gradient the people who are better<br>off tend to have worse health experience<br>and so this sorry thank you very much<br>the people are better off well they do<br>actually few at the only exception one<br>of the few exceptions is a few if you<br>fly frequently you're more at risk of<br>crashing and people who are worse off<br>don't do so well if any way so so the<br>social Brendon health runs from top to<br>bottom of the socio-economic spectrum<br>and they're caused by inequalities<br>within and between societies in terms of<br>access to resources like income<br>education<br>health care and adequate housing and<br>these lead to inequalities which have a<br>nebulous effect on us all but now I want<br>to move to the first part of my trilogy<br>of my lecture tonight and that is about<br>bugs and you may be wondering what on<br>earth I'm going to be talking about here<br>but some when i was when i was just<br>begun but I almost didn't make it to one<br>because i grew up in the late 1950s when<br>yes there were miracles and wonders and<br>modern medicine the discovery of a<br>vaccine against polio some amazing<br>surgical advances and these were all<br>wonderful things to have including<br>antibiotics but I almost didn't make it<br>out of the newborn unit at right or a<br>hospital because I was infected with<br>what was called the HPA well hospital<br>bug it was a Steffler cockle and fiction<br>that was running rampant around New<br>Zealand at the time and the response was<br>actually a public health strategy<br>isolation hand-washing and so forth but<br>actually the root cause of the problem<br>was to do with antibiotic resistance and<br>the over lavish use and indiscriminate<br>use of antibiotics so it was a medical<br>problem near but whatever the<br>interventions worked well and I lived to<br>survive my first scrape with a serious<br>bug Steph Lacock or bacterial infection<br>but probably fairly soon after that I<br>was exposed I discovered it subsequently<br>to another bug which will be a recurring<br>theme in my public health career and<br>this is the first of the ABCs of<br>hepatitis that I've encountered in my<br>career this was hepatitis A my parents<br>both suffered from what was called<br>yellow jaundice or hepatitis A infection<br>and subsequently when I had a blood test<br>in my teens I found I had antibodies to<br>Hibbert I say so i presume had an<br>asymptomatic infection with hepatitis A<br>without being aware of it<br>now the next bug that I encountered was<br>tuberculosis and this all comes down to<br>my father my father who died about 13<br>years ago actually next week and was a<br>sailor on the oculus during the Second<br>World War and during his time off the<br>coast of Japan very hot humid and<br>crowded conditions on board the Achilles<br>he became extremely unwell was<br>transferred to a hospital ship while<br>both boats were steaming away at sea and<br>then ended up for six months in<br>Greenland hospital recuperating but<br>without any antibiotic treatment but<br>probably what was tuberculosis infection<br>continued to plague him throughout his<br>life intermittently and I'm sure because<br>I had appt very strongly positive man to<br>test that I probably acquired an<br>asymptomatic latent TB infection so that<br>was another bug now this condition<br>continued to affect my father until he<br>actually required removal of one of his<br>lungs surgically in his 60s as a result<br>of that tuberculosis disease dad was an<br>energetic and intelligent man who with<br>my mother Mamie here tonight with my<br>siblings provided a stable and loving<br>environment in which I thrived and dad<br>was a minister of the church and<br>something of a Red River and he was a<br>firm labour party supporter I can<br>remember being roped into distributing<br>Labour Party pamphlets and the letter<br>boxes in gisburn as we grew up and he<br>was active in matters of social justice<br>and you can see this photo of him here<br>with Judith Todd who was the daughter of<br>Garfield Todd who was a prime minister<br>of Rhodesia and under house arrest by n<br>smith who ran an apartheid regime and<br>she came on a talking tour of New<br>Zealand actually stayed with us so there<br>was that spirit of standing up against<br>social justice and in that context of a<br>supportive home environment I grew up<br>and acquired some operating principles<br>which inform the way that I've worked<br>and the things that I've focused on in<br>my career and I think now really<br>expressed very well in words that are<br>3,000 years old from the Old Testament<br>prophet Micah which says<br>act justly love mercy and walk humbly<br>with your God so I had a strong sense of<br>vocation to train in medicine and yes<br>there are some similarities with another<br>well-known character I didn't quite go<br>far as Che Guevara to overthrow this<br>sort of established regime that<br>certainly had some scrapes I think I was<br>a signed up member to halt all race the<br>racist to us it wasn't quite as active<br>as my brother who was out there against<br>nuclear powered submarines on the harbor<br>and beating up the the police squad and<br>the apartheid demonstration at Eden Park<br>but nevertheless I've had a very strong<br>interest in training and medicine and<br>working with people who are less well<br>off some of my role models were family<br>friends who were doctors but also there<br>was a great television series called<br>doctor in the house at that time which I<br>thought would really cool but I read<br>widely and one of the people who greatly<br>impressed me was Albert Schweitzer who<br>who turned his back on a glittering<br>career and went to work in Africa in a<br>very much bush hospital setting I ended<br>up at Auckland medical school because I<br>heard that it was better than Otago and<br>so it has continued to be the case and<br>many of these unlikely looking people in<br>that photograph I very good friends<br>today and remain so and a few of them<br>here tonight with us and here we all are<br>a little bit thicker around the middle<br>thinner on top and reduced in number at<br>our 33 year old reunion last year now<br>the other person has very formative in<br>my life of that stage was my wonderful<br>wife Shirley and she came into my life<br>at the end of our time in medical school<br>and she's been my very best friend and<br>companion in life and brings a very<br>important dose of common sense to my<br>idealistic strivings and together we<br>headed off on my medical elective to the<br>land of the unexpected Papua New Guinea<br>and that's where I got the bug for Papua<br>New Guinea and working in developing<br>countries we met there for three months<br>and worked in a bush hospital and the<br>buyer valley and the high<br>papua new guinea emit some wonderful<br>role models there Paul and Joyce child's<br>who he was an American GP from Seattle<br>and they've continued to be good friends<br>for many many years I had some amazing<br>experiences as a medical student having<br>to do operations be cast out into the<br>bush for two weeks and living with<br>people living a very much a stone-age<br>existence so at the end of that time let<br>adventure as we left and flew out I said<br>I will return Shirley said something<br>like not if I can help it then it was<br>back to New Zealand and some wonderful<br>house surgeon years in Rotorua hospital<br>which was a fantastic place to train as<br>a junior doctor in his unit to get an<br>all-round experience and I had an<br>exciting but exhausting time as a house<br>surgeon we used to put in when I were a<br>lad about a hundred to 120 hours a week<br>sometimes working in it was exhausting<br>but also invigorating and then up to<br>national men's hospital to do my diploma<br>obstetrics performing lots of<br>interesting procedures and delivering<br>babies and caring for very sick newborn<br>babies then I came back to rotorua and<br>worked as a pediatric registrar for a<br>year and that really got me interested<br>in public health I did a diploma and<br>child health through the opposition the<br>Otago University and that started me<br>thinking about the role of community<br>agencies and the work that's done<br>outside of hospitals to improve people's<br>health and an important role model for<br>me in that in that situation was dr.<br>Johan Moreau who's the senior<br>pediatrician now still at writer or a<br>hospital after all these years and a<br>great exemplar of what it means to be a<br>community pediatrician after about four<br>or five years in New Zealand we felt we<br>should go back to Papua New Guinea and<br>with two very small children and hand<br>one of them was only six weeks which was<br>a really stupid thing to do in hindsight<br>but you know when you're young you don't<br>think about these things we went back<br>and worked at the same hospital I did my<br>medical elective and and I was medical<br>officer for a population of about 65,000<br>people in the western highlands and<br>Inger provinces of Papua New Guinea and<br>it was a wonderful life<br>beautiful climate lush place very very<br>friendly people when they weren't<br>fighting each other with spears bows and<br>arrows and then increasingly shotguns<br>and rocket launchers and things and it<br>was a wonderful exposure to just a<br>diversity of medical issues and<br>challenges in this photograph you can<br>see a family sitting around sorting<br>coffee beans from the coffee plantations<br>but the woman on the left is a probably<br>a woman in her 50s she looks about in<br>her 80s or 90s at say and she's got<br>ascites fluid in her abdomen from<br>chronic hepatitis B infection I came<br>across all sorts of diseases they didn't<br>teach me about in medical school pig<br>bail which is a Clostridium toxin in<br>fiction of the gut leading to a record<br>and extremely painful death but actually<br>that disease is now Reddick ated as a<br>result of fantastic research which has<br>developed a pig Bell vaccine and all<br>children and Papua New Guinea Harlan's<br>have that vaccine that disease is<br>practically gone one of the many<br>challenges working in the city situation<br>is getting from A to B and in a climate<br>that's quite wet from time to time with<br>suboptimal roads suboptimal vehicles and<br>often suboptimal drivers it was always<br>quite exciting but some extremely<br>challenging situations and despite the<br>plentiful gardens I would come across<br>often some really serious cases of<br>pediatric malnutrition and often this is<br>with twins where mothers didn't have<br>enough milk to provide for the babies so<br>there we were our growing family we came<br>back to New Zealand had another baby at<br>national in its hospital that's Michael<br>he doesn't look anything like that<br>anymore young man with a very large<br>beard neither do I look like that<br>anymore and then we had four years in a<br>even more isolated place in the<br>highlands called telephone man and it's<br>about as far as ways you can go from<br>anywhere at Papa New Guinea fact there<br>are no roads connecting telephone and<br>with anywhere else fly-in fly-out it's a<br>dried-up lakebed in the highlands right<br>near the border with west papua province<br>of indonesia and there was a war going<br>on between the Indonesians and the<br>operation<br>the rebel group in on that part of the<br>border so I got involved with refugees<br>and with rebels as well as all the<br>medical problems I was the first doctor<br>in this area it never been another<br>doctor this area had been opened up by<br>the Australian administration in the<br>late 1950s so relatively limited<br>exposure to the outside world we had<br>some incredible experiences there as a<br>family one of them was to adopt a little<br>girl for a period of time I came home<br>one day in the four-wheel drive and said<br>darling I've got something to show you<br>and in my arms was Norma who mother died<br>from acute fulminating hepatitis and we<br>couldn't do anything to save her and she<br>was going to be taken back by her family<br>to an extremely remote place without any<br>mother to feed her and would almost<br>certainly died so I convinced the father<br>at the airstrip as he was about to board<br>the plane that we would look after his<br>little girl when she was well enough we<br>would bring her back to him so that's<br>what we did and as far as we know she's<br>still alive and well today things didn't<br>always go as expected this is the land<br>of the unexpected and one day a patient<br>to end up on the back of a truck with a<br>20 kilogram ovarian cyst so these are<br>some of the unexpected challenges they<br>don't prepare you for in medical school<br>so quite a lot of time operating a set<br>up the first operating theatre there in<br>telephonin ambulatory blood transfusion<br>centre and had some rather hair-raising<br>and hair graying experiences but<br>counterpoise to that is the wonderful<br>wonderful people had the privilege of<br>working with this woman on the on the<br>left here as Josie bong cept the woman<br>carrying a very light load for a puppy<br>new guinean woman probably sweet potato<br>as well as greens and those bilham's and<br>she was a woman's leader and she had the<br>remarkable audacity to shoot a pig in<br>public which was a very bold thing for a<br>woman to do basically saying women rock<br>which is a very important things to say<br>in a very paternalistic male-dominated<br>society where women had been treated as<br>beasts of burden and the young woman the<br>woman on the right is free to one tongue<br>who is now standing for Parliament in<br>the telephone in district she was an<br>outstanding nursing officer and this is<br>her adopted daughter who<br>is by the name of Shirley so malaria was<br>an all common a very common problem I<br>had to deal with and here's that<br>framework we talked about so we have<br>people who are vulnerable to malaria we<br>have the vector which is that female<br>mosquito is the only one that bites<br>people to suck their blood by the way<br>and then Plasmodium falciparum or vivax<br>the the agent that's transmitted by the<br>mosquito that all this wouldn't happen<br>of course only we had an environment<br>that was warm enough and moist enough<br>and so forth to help mosquitoes breed<br>and be up to transmit Plasmodium vivax<br>will foster from more have you to the<br>susceptible person so they formed a lot<br>of my work and I spent a lot of time<br>trying to prevent malaria but I did a<br>few other things besides I actually<br>performed a caesarean section by<br>torchlight when the generator ran out of<br>power one very wet night I trained<br>community health workers and village<br>birth attendants all across the<br>telephone and district established the<br>district surgical facility laboratory<br>services an ambulatory blood bank that<br>just means we got everybody blood<br>grouped in the high school and local<br>community and when we needed blood we<br>just ran around in a truck and gather<br>them together and bleed them<br>I undertook ended up doing quite a bit<br>of basic public health research but I<br>didn't really know it and I didn't<br>really know how to do it but we<br>undertook tuberculosis surveys among<br>Papua and refugees who cross the border<br>into refugee camps and we're an<br>incredibly bad way I designed a district<br>hospital some of my architectural<br>aspirations coming to the fore there<br>it's still standing today believe it or<br>not we initiated some programs we tried<br>to interpose between the mosquitoes and<br>people with a bed net distribution<br>program first and that part of the<br>country trained people how to treat the<br>bed nets and replace them with malaria<br>metric and filariasis surveys you have<br>to conduct those between 10pm and 2 a.m.<br>which is the time when the the<br>filariasis worm gets into the peripheral<br>blood stream and the mosquitoes come out<br>to bite at the same time so when you<br>take the blood you have to get up in the<br>middle of the night and go random white<br>people up and take the blood test we<br>also undertook a health survey an<br>immunization program among a remote<br>group of people called the hugger hi and<br>this was an amazing experience as people<br>group of people have been contacted for<br>the first time in 1985 and it was an<br>amazing privilege to go and spend weeks<br>with them flown in by helicopter with<br>film crew from National Geographic and<br>an amazing medical anthropologist from<br>the Papua New Guinea Institute a medical<br>research a New Jersey speaking Carol<br>Jenkins who unfortunately has since<br>passed away but here's a little clip<br>from the National Geographic programmers<br>chris bullen is a doctor attached to the<br>Baptist Mission originally from New<br>Zealand he has worked in other parts of<br>Papua New Guinea but never a place where<br>the needs were so pressing we can't just<br>disconnect ourselves from our neighbors<br>and other countries and to me what i'm<br>doing here is as part of the command to<br>love my neighbor i see these people as<br>much my neighbors is the person who<br>lives next door to me in my house yeah<br>visit my<br>chris is no stranger to malaria an<br>ailment that most haga high live with<br>most of the time huh nothing time hmm<br>very pale pasty tongue so sadly the<br>dangerously swollen spleen that can<br>accompany the disease is a common sight<br>here its message crying brought out<br>around here right over to the right side<br>of his lower abdomen and I'm trying to<br>get below it here right down on it and<br>the pelvis schools great dad is a great<br>five spleen the chances of this actually<br>rupturing well I understand it that it<br>hasn't ruptured already malaria is not<br>the only disease Chris treats penis by<br>emerging from their isolation the Haga<br>high are now coming in contact with many<br>previously unknown diseases of the<br>civilized world ironically their search<br>for medical assistance is leading them<br>through a minefield of new threats to<br>their health well these people have been<br>isolated from most of the common<br>diseases that have earned the West and<br>in a lot of other countries that are<br>killer diseases if you don't have any<br>protection against them we know that<br>these people have a poor immune response<br>poor defense system against a lot of<br>these diseases and what we're trying to<br>do here is to to give them immunity or<br>protection before the disease reaches<br>them hey if we don't get them now and do<br>something about it then the chances of<br>this group of people surviving the next<br>the immunization program has been a<br>difficult thing to implement among a<br>semi-nomadic population beyond the<br>problem of catching up with people lies<br>another challenge to keep the vaccines<br>alive for more than a couple of days in<br>high heat and humidity carol has been<br>trying for three years to come up with a<br>solution this year her efforts paid off<br>a small solar-powered refrigerator was<br>donated by rotary international finally<br>vaccines taken for granted in the West<br>polio tetanus diphtheria can be given to<br>the Haga hi the solar fridge will also<br>offer hope to haga hi children as<br>vaccines against common childhood<br>diseases can be administered for the<br>first time somehow it is the childhood<br>mortality that seems the most tragic so<br>something of that incredible experience<br>i'm pleased to say that those people the<br>Haga high people are still alive and<br>doing well so some lessons from that<br>time in Papua New Guinea I think the<br>world is a very unequal place culture<br>and environment have a huge influence on<br>people's life chances I discover that<br>women are the key to community health<br>and when you enable women who are<br>illiterate to learn how to read and<br>write it's absolutely transformational a<br>lot can be achieved with very little low<br>income nations can actually out form<br>perform high-income nations some areas I<br>was horrified to come back to New<br>Zealand from Papua New Guinea where we<br>had 95% immunization coverage to work in<br>a general practice in or taro and find<br>that immunization coverage was way below<br>that now it's pleasing to say that we've<br>we've got up to that level in New<br>Zealand but it's taken a long time<br>health work is most effective when it is<br>a team-based multidisciplinary actor<br>30 i either doctor is on tap and not on<br>top and expertise makes many takes many<br>different guises there are wonderful<br>people in communities like this who know<br>far more about everything than I would<br>ever hope to do it's very humbling to<br>work with people who have such huge<br>commitment and not expecting a<br>remuneration or reward for it and work<br>under extremely difficult circumstances<br>so health workers I worked with for<br>example sometimes wouldn't receive pay<br>to six or nine months from the<br>government and pay office but they keep<br>working public health interventions i<br>discovered can have a huge potential to<br>transform health research of all kinds<br>can make an amazing difference i really<br>learnt that well with my contact with<br>the institute of medical research the<br>value of the research behind the<br>biomedical research behind the<br>development of vaccines and in the<br>implementation research about what works<br>best to get it out there to people but i<br>also found out that you can only do so<br>much with basic training so felt the<br>need to come back to New Zealand and<br>train and I thought that Public Health<br>would be the weight a place that I<br>should explore further and I was very<br>very fortunate to train with such<br>luminaries in public health in New<br>Zealand such as our beloved row Jackson<br>who's with us here tonight and Roberts<br>here to Robert beaglehole Roberts Craig<br>and in that department of community<br>health back in the Grafton campus I did<br>my diploma and masters in public health<br>and really started to understand what it<br>was all about getting the theory around<br>some of the practice the other person in<br>that photograph is Paul Stevenson Paul<br>runs a company now but he was at that<br>time the general manager of Auckland<br>Regional Public Health Service and I<br>pick up that free at in a moment but the<br>other person who was really helpful to<br>me when I came back was Graham woodfield<br>my gram ran the Auckland blood<br>transfusion service in those days and<br>he'd worked and set up blood transfusion<br>services in Papua New Guinea and he got<br>me a job running the National hepatitis<br>C look back program which I did I went<br>around hundreds of people had received<br>potentially infected blood samples and<br>undertook blood tests on them in some<br>cases I had to go on break<br>news that they've become infected it was<br>an amazing experience and I I wrote one<br>of my first publications as a result of<br>that work and even got clean shaven of<br>course in these days in in the press<br>talking about the fight against<br>hepatitis B which was the next program<br>to do with blood this is almost the<br>trifecta of a B and C hepatitis this is<br>the work that Paul Stevenson got me<br>involved in the National hepatitis B<br>screening program and we ran that<br>program in the northern region for<br>several years and then another bug this<br>was meningococcal disease and I was<br>working at Auckland Regional Public<br>Health when the meningococcal disease<br>epidemic hit us in the mid-1990s this is<br>another be bug meningococcal B and we<br>really didn't know what to do about it<br>there wasn't a vaccine for this bug at<br>the time here's that host Victor agent<br>environment scenario again we had<br>susceptible people especially children<br>with very limited immunity we had a<br>symptomatic adult carriers who were<br>carrying the bugs in the throat and<br>saliva we had a very dangerous organism<br>neisseria meningitidis it's got nothing<br>to do with living in a nice area by the<br>way and we have an environment of which<br>was enabling this epidemic to occur and<br>public health research identified<br>household crowding the most important<br>risk factor for the cause of the spread<br>of this bug the other risk fact that was<br>exposure to secondhand smoke and that<br>got me thinking but we did some work<br>around developing a vaccine and i went<br>with Professor diamond linen to Geneva<br>to the wh 0 to argue for meningococcal B<br>vaccine development in New Zealand but<br>in the meantime we use these wonderful<br>maps developed by dan Exeter is a health<br>geographer who is here tonight as a tool<br>for advocacy and arguing for action and<br>this is an app showing all the cases of<br>meningococcal disease under eight year<br>olds and overlaying it with crowding<br>household crowding density you can see<br>where most of the cases occur occur<br>overlaps with where the most of the<br>crowding was in Auckland at that time so<br>that was the focus for a number of<br>public health programs i initiated the<br>meningococcal disease awareness bro<br>we trained teams of labor workers to go<br>door-to-door with information to to<br>educate the public around the early<br>presenting features of meningococcal<br>disease and to go and seek help as<br>quickly as possible in the 1998 they<br>visited more than 11,000 households and<br>engaged more than 9,000 people in<br>discussion raised awareness and that<br>year no meningococcal deaths appeared<br>amongst those populations for the first<br>time since the epidemic began which<br>brings me on to thinking about bedrooms<br>because we were interested with<br>meningococcal disease and household<br>crowding so it's not just bugs that are<br>important it's the environment and the<br>environment in this case was crowded<br>houses and crowded bedrooms in<br>particular Florence Nightingale put it<br>extremely well when she said the<br>connection between health and the<br>dwellings of the population is one of<br>the most important that exists and I<br>believe that's very much the case and it<br>still is the case of course where we put<br>the blame for overcrowding is contested<br>and it continues to be the source of<br>much discussion and the cartoon if you<br>can't read it is housing New Zealand<br>representative saying you must remember<br>some people choose to live in these<br>overcrowded conditions or what about<br>stress and sadness that results will<br>they choose that as well and we still<br>hear these arguments played out and in<br>the newspaper at this time I got<br>involved in running a community program<br>in otero with Tara he'll think we set up<br>a program funded through the National<br>Health Committee again a community-based<br>project training local people as housing<br>ambassador was to go door-to-door and to<br>talk to people about how to warm their<br>homes about the dangers of crowding<br>about resources that were available to<br>them through housing is you know working<br>income New Zealand etc to improve their<br>conditions and then the sort of icing on<br>the cake was to get involved with really<br>what turned out to be a massive public<br>health intervention called the healthy<br>housing program with them people from<br>Counties Manukau dhb and Auckland DHB<br>Jude woolston and agita Durham balam it<br>took me about three weeks to pronounce<br>his name we developed the healthy<br>housing program which was a combined<br>intervention with housing New Zealand<br>staff and<br>health nurses to assess and assist<br>families living in overcrowding in these<br>areas and then to actually have a<br>rebuild program in place all up I think<br>this program across the government<br>somewhere between 60 and 65 million<br>dollars over about five years modified<br>and insulated and ventilated thousands<br>of homes and improved the lots of many<br>families so they took these bog-standard<br>state houses with families doubling up<br>and overcrowded in them worked out all<br>their social problems one family had 23<br>agencies trying to come to that<br>household every few weeks with various<br>problems we got them down to three<br>through the actions of savvy public<br>health nurses and then refitted their<br>house out so that disabled people could<br>move around between bathroom and bedroom<br>the family court will sit down have a<br>meal together in the one room and there<br>was a study space for the kids and<br>turned them to really nice warm dry<br>affordable homes and I can remember<br>going to a housing new zealand board<br>meeting and david long it was on the<br>board at that time not long before he<br>passed away and he said this is what<br>this agency is all about it's about<br>providing adequate affordable housing<br>for low-income New Zealanders and we're<br>not doing it properly so that was<br>fantastic support from the top to get<br>this program going through some<br>evaluations showed that it was<br>beneficial in reducing housing related<br>hospitalizations at minimal hospital by<br>almost 40% and no cases of meningococcal<br>disease in the three target areas over<br>that pilot period but I was asking<br>myself you know how can we measure what<br>what these interventions actually do is<br>philly soft evaluation and I bumped into<br>Anthony Rodgers who's amazingly flown<br>here today from Sydney just to be here<br>tonight Anthony thank you so much<br>wherever you are who has been a great<br>inspiration over many years not only to<br>me but to many of us here in the room<br>tonight Anthony really introduced me to<br>the randomized control trial which some<br>say is the greatest discovery of all<br>time and whilst it's not the be-all and<br>end-all if you really want to know<br>something works and you want to get rid<br>of all the Murphy stuff around the edges<br>which could be competing explanations we<br>call that bias or confounding then you<br>need to do a randomized control trial<br>now it's not always possible or ethical<br>but where you can it's a really good<br>thing to do and so that's one of the<br>things I'm really in the<br>doing these days and when you get a<br>number of these trials and you pull the<br>evidence together you can do some what's<br>called meta analyses and you can publish<br>them on a website or on a magazine run<br>by the cochrane database it's a it's a<br>fantastic way of summiting evidence best<br>evidence to inform decision making and I<br>discovered you could actually do this<br>with housing so i worked with Professor<br>Philip a hardon Chapman and Otago<br>University and colleagues and Alastair<br>was involved in this as well it was<br>first of all a trial of retrofitting<br>insulation into houses throughout New<br>Zealand which demonstrated an effect on<br>benefit for health out of it and then<br>another randomized control trial of<br>installing clean heating in homes to<br>reduce asthma and children and that also<br>demonstrated a benefit of clean<br>affordable heating and home so you can<br>do randomized control trials of almost<br>anything but housing and crowding is<br>like much other things that we see in<br>public health there is a social gradient<br>and you can see that people in the the<br>best of situations here have the the<br>lowest proportion of children and H 0 to<br>14 and crowded housing people in the<br>worst off decile have very high level of<br>crowding you can see that approaches<br>sixty percent in parts of Auckland in<br>the Pacific community and about forty<br>percent among Maori families now there<br>may be social and cultural reasons for<br>why we have large families in homes but<br>actually the driving forces housing<br>affordability and we are still grappling<br>with that problem today as you know and<br>it's becoming less possible for families<br>to have decent affordable housing and<br>not have to sleep in the back of a van<br>and this was just the photo in the he<br>rolled last year and I imagine it's<br>getting worse as we speak so despite all<br>these wonderful public health<br>interventions the problem remains and we<br>need to do more about it but I mentioned<br>that smoke started to enter my<br>consciousness at when we started going<br>to homes and we thought about<br>meningococcal disease and exposure to<br>secondhand smoke being a risk factor for<br>some infectious diseases and so I got<br>interested in smoke<br>and environmental tobacco smoke is one<br>of the major sources of indoor air<br>pollution besides all the other things<br>we often worry about if we can get rid<br>of secondhand smoke in homes we could<br>make a huge difference for public health<br>smoking ended up being near the top of<br>the list in the report that Anthony<br>Rogers lead was published here in 2002<br>tobacco smoking was up there with high<br>blood pressure and alcohol in this list<br>of the sort of high hitting areas of<br>health burden around the world not just<br>in developing developed countries like<br>New Zealand but in developing countries<br>as well so there it is right up in the<br>top 10 still in 2010 elevated blood<br>pressure get rid of that salt in your<br>diet tobacco smoking harmful alcohol use<br>it was good to see people drinking in<br>moderation tonight physical inactivity<br>we should all walking up and down the<br>stairs not use the elevators and poor<br>nutrition no cake please ok we've come a<br>long way in tobacco in New Zealand and<br>tobacco was introduced in the early days<br>as an item of trade and it's become a<br>real source of burden for Maori New<br>Zealanders and there are still as a<br>large gap in life expectancy between<br>Maori and non-maori New Zealanders which<br>is completely unacceptable and at least<br>two years of that gap is attributable to<br>tobacco smoking and doctors have been<br>part of the problem we actually<br>supported smoking in the 1950s and 60s<br>more doctors smoke camels than any other<br>cigarette according to this ad and we<br>grew tobacco and marketed from these<br>wonderful art deco buildings that Napier<br>vs. Rothman's headquarters I think and I<br>think my grandfather had she is in that<br>company so it was quite normal and even<br>i had a tender age and from a four and<br>manga papa primary school in gisburn<br>dressed as Charlie Chaplin had a cigar<br>sticking out of my mouth and when I had<br>aspired to be a cartoonist I can see<br>that the smoke signals coming out of<br>that cigarette attracting attention but<br>smoking is a risk factor for lots of<br>things for cardiovascular disease<br>diabetes for cancer chronic respiratory<br>disease and actually it's a risk factor<br>for some communicable diseases and<br>infectious disease as well and it's a<br>huge challenge because it's going to<br>probably take out<br>almost half a billion people by the mid<br>century according to these forecasts if<br>we don't do something with smoking and<br>really the only way we're going to<br>tackle this problem is to have at least<br>adult consumption or reduce it even<br>further in New Zealand's case we're<br>trying to reduce adult consumption down<br>to five percent of prevalence down to<br>five percent by the year twenty<br>twenty-five but you can see we can get<br>quite a big hit on the mortality by 2050<br>just by getting more people to quit<br>smoking and smoking like everything else<br>has a social gradient so the most<br>deprived New Zealand is about thirty<br>percent smoked the least deprived most<br>of the people in this room very few of<br>us would smoke in fact it's pretty much<br>non normal and gathering such as this<br>for people to be smokers but if you are<br>a smoker new smoking cessation clinic<br>starting at the University campus in two<br>weeks and I'm happy to advise you after<br>this meeting about how to quit so<br>thinking about this and these terms<br>we've used for meningococcal disease and<br>malaria you can think about the host is<br>the susceptible child vulnerable to<br>tobacco smoking there may be some<br>genetics there but fundamentally it's<br>about peer pressure and modeling by<br>parents and the normalization of smoking<br>in society and it's that environment<br>where if you don't remember not that far<br>away we had Formula One race cars<br>plastered with melber assigns and we had<br>rugby games sponsored by the tobacco<br>industry where we've done well to get<br>rid of that but we still have big<br>tobacco playing in the background as the<br>victor like the blood filled mosquito<br>sucking people's blood and the agent of<br>harm of course cigarettes if we want to<br>make a dent and prevalence of a problem<br>in our populations we need to think<br>about not just the effectiveness but<br>also the reach but some of my research<br>in tobacco has been on effectiveness and<br>so we were fortunate to be funded by the<br>Hart Foundation and the Health Research<br>Council who deserved to be kept in place<br>and continue to be funded we hope in<br>this challenging environment to enable<br>people like me and my team to do what we<br>believe is really important work so we<br>began a trio of randomized control<br>trials looking at innovative<br>interventions to try and help people<br>quit smoking<br>called the IQ studies relic sonic and<br>picnic and picnic was the trial that I<br>led for my PhD which I as you can see I<br>did fairly late in life the beard was<br>graying by the stage in this study<br>rather humble sort of study just a minor<br>modification to routine cessation<br>practice actually showed a small but<br>significant benefit on quitting and so<br>let's now part of the guidelines of<br>smoking cessation is that if people are<br>going to quit smoking we encourage them<br>to start their nicotine patches several<br>weeks before they before they quit<br>smoking and it makes a difference to the<br>acquitting outcomes then along came a<br>very strange product on the scene called<br>electronic cigarettes what were these<br>products I don't know we didn't know<br>much about them the beginning that they<br>were selling a lot of them and that<br>sales exponential growth in sales has<br>continued to this day this is one of<br>these kind of disruptive innovations<br>that's occurred and we thought we would<br>be interested in being near first and<br>doing some of the first research and so<br>inspired by dr. Murray lokacin who was<br>public health champion New Zealand last<br>year and is celebrating his 80th<br>birthday in October we're meeting in<br>glenorchy at a conference in his honor<br>he's sort of mr. tobacco control New<br>Zealand he encouraged us to go and have<br>a look at these products and do some<br>simple research and we found when we<br>tested 40 people who fasted overnight<br>from smoking that electronic cigarettes<br>were about as good as the nicotine<br>inhaler at helping to reduce withdrawal<br>symptoms and craving to smoke but<br>cigarettes were far and away the better<br>thing if you're craving a cigarette<br>we'll have a cigarette you'll get feel<br>much better very quickly but electronic<br>cigarettes needed to be subjected to a<br>trial so we were fortunate to be able to<br>get funding from the hrc again to<br>undertake the world's first randomized<br>control trial of electronic cigarettes<br>for smoking cessation and we compared<br>them with placebo e-cigarettes with no<br>nicotine in them and of nicotine patches<br>and after a very long and protracted<br>process of getting published this was<br>the sort of pinnacle of my sabbatical in<br>2013 was getting this paper published in<br>the lancet and Viren<br>again my life is dr. e cigarette and its<br>continued to the day I still get<br>requests to speak and publish papers on<br>the back of that one publication and it<br>really brought home to me the importance<br>of getting our research out there not<br>just from my career but actually to get<br>new knowledge out there and disseminated<br>and getting people discussing and<br>debating are these things any good we<br>also undertook a cochrane review which<br>is where we pulled the data from the<br>studies you can see in this case there<br>was only one and really there are only<br>two still to this day so we really got<br>an early first mover advantage it's a<br>very important thing but e-cigarettes<br>potentially could actually make a<br>difference it depends on what you're<br>interested and if you're interested in<br>reducing harm to health if it's not so<br>much getting rid of tobacco or getting<br>rid of the back of industry but if<br>you're really interested in health<br>outcome then maybe low risk products<br>like e-cigarettes could actually sir<br>place displace harmful cigarettes and<br>help to reduce global cigarette<br>consumption you see it's not the<br>nicotine that's harmful it's all the<br>junk that people inhale with the<br>nicotine that causes the ham so e<br>cigarettes are wonderful because they're<br>so fascinating and they're such a source<br>of debate what is the goal do we want to<br>eradicate the tobacco industry tobacco<br>or stop people smoking or is it to<br>improve people's health is tobacco harm<br>reduction a valid strategy like giving<br>people methadone instead of heroin<br>through duty needles our electronic<br>cigarettes for like a clean needle is<br>nicotine a socially acceptable drug<br>should it be just treated like caffeine<br>we all drink coffee probably or at least<br>a cup of tea every now and then and we<br>think that's okay but we're actually<br>imbibing a psychoactive substance what<br>is the most important consideration is<br>it about the individual's health or<br>about the population health are smoking<br>an urgent public health problem or<br>should we take a precautionary approach<br>and we can see until the evidence on<br>harms from these products and merges in<br>20 or 30 years time what about<br>individual choice versus a paternalistic<br>or in any state actually I think nannies<br>are really helpful if you've got a baby<br>so maybe in any states can be good<br>things<br>and what should we do about engaging<br>with industry the tobacco industry in<br>this case probably the world's epitome<br>of evil if you like thinking about<br>corporate harm should we engage with<br>such an industry in order to achieve<br>public health gains well it's a question<br>which I don't have all the answers to<br>but you might have kept them thinking<br>around that and then I've also been<br>privileged to work with some wonderful<br>colleagues and this is associate<br>professor marawa Glover who has been<br>co-director with me of a program of<br>research called the tobacco control<br>research tarina we received five million<br>dollars which is an awful lot of money<br>and a whole lot of responsibility to<br>conduct our strategic research to help<br>reduce smoking prevalence in New Zealand<br>over four years and we've got about a<br>year to go we've had 30 projects funded<br>through that and I've been<br>multidisciplinary multi-institution and<br>a number of them have led to changes in<br>policy or decide helped people decide<br>not to pursue particular directions in<br>tobacco control so it's been a<br>productive collaboration thinking again<br>about this formula of population health<br>impact we've looked at effectiveness<br>what about reach well again an<br>innovation from my colleagues and CTO<br>you and now nehe mobile health we all<br>have mobile phones with us probably<br>tonight everyone has them I think<br>something like 110 percent of New<br>Zealanders own a mobile phone go figure<br>but some people are very greedy but<br>mobile phones have been shown in a trial<br>that was conducted led by Anthony Rogers<br>and conduct by a team at me he and we've<br>subsequently conducted a large number of<br>mobile phone-based randomised control<br>trials and related studies that show<br>these things are amazing device for<br>reaching people where other things can't<br>reach them and enabling them to change<br>their behavior in a healthy direction<br>and I had the great privilege a couple<br>of years ago going with Alastair<br>professor Alistair Woodward up to Papua<br>New Guinea and we signed a memorandum of<br>understanding with the Papua New Guinean<br>director first Papua New Guinea and<br>director of the Papua New Guinea<br>institute of medical research and one of<br>the first cabs off the rank with our<br>collaborative work was a mobile phone<br>based intervention to reach remote rural<br>health workers and Papa New Guinea with<br>a malaria management protocol<br>change so how about that for convergence<br>in the career so I've been able to go<br>full circle from Bug's two bedrooms to<br>smoke and back to bugs again so where<br>are we going with Public Health and<br>you'll be pleased to know this is about<br>second to last slide I think we've got a<br>number of new threats before us with big<br>threats like climate change<br>globalization non-communicable diseases<br>which are actually communicable if you<br>think about it because a lot of its to<br>do with how we exchange ideas and<br>develop social norms demographic change<br>this burgeoning older population but<br>we've got lots of opportunities and<br>possibilities through technology such as<br>mobile phones and big data and wearable<br>devices and maybe even e-cigarettes but<br>the same public health principles are at<br>work tackling health inequity upstream<br>at the policy level undertaking<br>affordable accessible providing<br>affordable accessible health care and<br>working with engaged informed people and<br>communities those things will remain I'm<br>sure as bedrocks of public health and<br>public health research changing people's<br>behavior as you know if you've tried to<br>lose weight is extremely difficult so to<br>change behavior it may be necessary to<br>change more than behavior and that's a<br>key message I guess from me tonight as<br>we need to work at both individual<br>behavior change but also change the<br>environment in order to enable people to<br>change the behavior in a healthy<br>direction it should be like falling off<br>a log to change your behavior not<br>swimming upstream and healthcare another<br>key message from my career and public<br>health is that it's a vital part of<br>Public Health dealing with the social<br>causes of disease in responding to its<br>medical effects aren't mutually<br>exclusive and we should be doing both<br>and public health people sometimes I<br>think can be a bit Precious about not<br>wanting to engage with their clinical<br>colleagues we should be working together<br>the complex problems before us demand<br>much greater integration of public<br>health perspectives with clinical<br>perspectives so my research manifesto<br>over the next few years if I'm given<br>time to do that is to continue to<br>undertake real world not ivory tower<br>research on novel practicable affordable<br>ways to improve the effectiveness reach<br>and reduce inequalities in New Zealand<br>and low and middle-income nations of<br>simple interventions that are going to<br>make a difference I'll be doing more on<br>smoking I'm doing some more in alcohol<br>and I'm doing some work on gambling so<br>I'm really tackling will those nasty<br>sins the seven deadly sins perhaps but<br>I'm also looking at the Sun demux these<br>conjunctions of infectious and<br>non-infectious diseases communicable<br>non-communicable diseases tobacco is a<br>risk factor for tuberculosis tobacco is<br>also a risk elective for type 2 diabetes<br>and so we need to look at these<br>conjunctions of these colliding<br>epidemics we need to work with<br>meaningful outcome measures that make<br>sense to end users the public it should<br>be involved in designing our trials the<br>healthcare providers and the<br>policymakers so the results actually<br>makes sense to them can be translated<br>into policy and practice and to do that<br>we need to make the information<br>available to people so i'm now on<br>Twitter and Facebook and all those other<br>social media things we need to be social<br>marketing gurus as well as scientists my<br>career in public health would not be<br>possible without a penalty of people I<br>refer to some of them by name tonight<br>but there are plenty more of them some<br>of them here in the audience tonight and<br>some not but I'm deeply indebted and I<br>wouldn't get here tonight if it wasn't<br>for them and I really want to say a huge<br>thank you to my amazing dedicated team<br>of co-workers at the National Institute<br>for Health innovation and in the school<br>of population health and a bunch of<br>people outside who helped us make a<br>difference I think through our research<br>we also have collaborators around the<br>world and it's just a delight to be able<br>to work with them and mentor some of<br>those developing researchers in other<br>countries so thank you and thank you<br>also to the Health Research Council the<br>Hart Foundation and the Ministry of<br>Health for enabling us to do this work<br>so some parting words only when we part<br>the veil of statistical anonymity to see<br>our loved ones looking back only by<br>inviting others to Pierre across with us<br>will public health engender the passion<br>it warrants and requires only by<br>renouncing the myth of the public well I<br>believe the full promise of public<br>health in the modern age be kept and so<br>the challenge to myself and my<br>colleagues in public health and public<br>researchers to remember that in the<br>words of our prime minister at the end<br>of the day behind the statistics are<br>real people with real lives and we need<br>to keep the people in public health it's<br>what I signed up for all those years ago<br>it's about serving the people here are<br>hard to now nuit what the OL Ayrton<br>gotta get hangar to hangar touch what is<br>the most important thing of the world it<br>is people its people it is people thank<br>you very much um well I'm Alistair<br>Woodward and it's my job just to say a<br>little something at the end and the<br>reason that I'm up here is that I was<br>the head of school when Chris joined the<br>university and he and I share many<br>interests and continued to work together<br>on a number of the topics that that<br>Chris's so wonderfully and vividly<br>described and there are three things<br>that I look for in an inaugural lecture<br>his first thing is sort of curious about<br>people's career track how did they come<br>to be where they are and Chris I think<br>you you know you drew know in a lovely<br>way drew a thread between that elective<br>and papua new guinea and and dr e<br>cigarette and i must admit along the way<br>and you know that national geographic<br>film clip that's gold there was a<br>certain resemblance to che I don't know<br>with you felt that except for one thing<br>and that was the glasses<br>I hope you hold on to those because<br>so the the second thing I suppose that<br>the inaugural lectures give an<br>opportunity you know is to tell people a<br>little bit about the topic that you're<br>working on and I think you've done that<br>you know you've done that that<br>wonderfully I liked the the bugs you<br>know bids and smoke idea that there are<br>all public health issues that are not oh<br>well they are all but there doesn't mean<br>that they're not new as well so their<br>problems of the present as well as the<br>past the the beds was a metaphor in my<br>mind anyway for all the environmental<br>factors we've got to be aware of and<br>which provide many opportunities you<br>know for making a difference and then<br>the smoke the all the single largest<br>preventable cause of ill health and New<br>Zealand and in many other countries but<br>then the I suppose the third thing and<br>then the way this is much precious<br>because there are not many other<br>opportunities apart from inaugurals to<br>get this insight is to learn about the<br>person you know about these individuals<br>that we work with learned a bit about<br>their character and I took a number of<br>things from this lecture I mean one of<br>them Chris's extrordinary assured he<br>knows who he is he's at ease for<br>themselves and I think that's because of<br>the very strong values base that he<br>works from and the family that he has<br>behind him to support him um Chris is<br>extraordinary humble I don't know if<br>that came across to you but he is he<br>doesn't push himself forward in my<br>experience he just takes on tasks that<br>he thinks are important and then does<br>difficult work so well that he can't be<br>overlooked it's been the recurring theme<br>I think through<br>as career and then the other thing about<br>Chris that I think was extremely no very<br>evident through the lecture is just how<br>resourceful he is I mean doing caesarean<br>sections by candlelight you know<br>torchlight torchlight a one up from<br>candles torching oh well that's easy<br>then or whether it's steering a sort of<br>secure route through the e-cigarette<br>controversies which Kristen talked about<br>but you know presented certain<br>difficulties or leading a very<br>successful research group at the<br>University which again Kristen made much<br>of this but CTR you and me he entirely<br>dependent on external sources of money<br>and yet he has pulled that off so Chris<br>has really been a privilege to learn<br>about your experiences your achievements<br>and your aspirations thank you very much<br>and congratulations I just like to offer<br>my thanks Chris for a wonderful<br>enlightening lecture both revealing and<br>enlightening it's really just for me to<br>close the formal proceedings for tonight<br>and thank you all for coming and just to<br>remind you that we have two inaugural<br>lectures for next week professor Andrew<br>shelling on Wednesday and Peter Adams on<br>Thursday both of the graph on campus so<br>you're very welcome to attend those as<br>well so on behalf of the faculty and all<br>our colleagues Chris congratulations on<br>your promotion and one for a wonderful</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
