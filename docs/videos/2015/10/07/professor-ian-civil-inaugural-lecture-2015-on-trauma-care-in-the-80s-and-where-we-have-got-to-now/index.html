accurate.</p><p>welcome good evening this is the first<br>of our inaugural lecture series 4 2015<br>inaugural lectures are one of the<br>highlights of our academic calendar and<br>this year we have a record seven new<br>professors that will be presenting their<br>inaugural lectures of becoming four<br>weeks inaugural lectures our tradition<br>that dates back to medieval times then<br>universities were traditionally only<br>professors recruited into a leet<br>Brotherhood supported and protected each<br>other living in cloistered surroundings<br>away from the real world answerable only<br>to themselves and to their esoteric<br>interests while expecting at the same<br>time to be hence handsomely remunerated<br>they're just being smarter than<br>everybody else I'll leave it to you to<br>inaugural lectures are a tradition that<br>had not changed in universities and they<br>are the public announcement of its new<br>professors they are a means of<br>showcasing our most eminent staff and a<br>celebration of an event that represents<br>foremost the pinnacle of one's academic<br>career elevation to the title professor<br>is not something that is take over<br>winery in academia the process of<br>selection is long and involved and<br>requires intense scrutiny by<br>international peers who then confirm to<br>the university that their pointy has an<br>international reputation and an<br>impending eminent expert thus giving<br>them a license to say anything they like<br>about this subject hoping that people<br>will believe what they say inaugural<br>lectures are also a wonderful<br>opportunity for colleagues families and<br>friends together and to learn about the<br>journey that has led to academic success<br>the milestones the decisions the<br>heartbreaks and most importantly those<br>mentors who have assisted along the way<br>so tonight it's my very great pleasure<br>to introduce the first inaugural<br>professor professor in civil and I now<br>invite professor brian perry who will<br>provide<br>thank you very much it's a real honor to<br>introduce to you if you didn't already<br>know him Professor Ian civil he's a very<br>good friend and a fantastic colleague<br>I've known him for many years starting<br>when I followed him as professor Graham<br>Hills chief registrar you may will<br>remember those days this was in the<br>early 80s in Auckland hospital and since<br>then I've been an or of his energy and<br>its accomplishments and his unflagging<br>enthusiasm for excellence in patient<br>care and particularly in vascular<br>surgery and trauma recourse and that's<br>what we're celebrating tonight and also<br>training it is salutary to note that he<br>remains as lie than listen as ever and<br>very few of us can unhappily probably<br>match that however his BMI is arguably<br>the only slight thing about them as we<br>shall see now<br>Ian Ian graduated from this a university<br>MB CHB in 1977 and within seven years he<br>was a awarded fellowship in the college<br>the Royal Australasian College of<br>Surgeons he had in a two-year stint in<br>New Jersey and the US where he did a<br>training scholarship and trauma and then<br>was appointed back here to start with<br>the senior lecturer in trauma and<br>military surgery I think coexisting with<br>him being a consultant and he's been<br>significant distinctions and awards and<br>in Europe forgive me if I overlooked<br>some of them but he's won the usual<br>podium presentations for excellence and<br>verse talks he's had a certificate of<br>merit for teaching in the college and he<br>is also a member of the most excellent<br>Order of the British Empire MBE he's got<br>a couple of medals distinguished medals<br>from the college as well he served so<br>well and he's a another significant part<br>of his work and his life has been in<br>some John where he's been and made an<br>officer commander and more recently a<br>night of grace and we've got hints there<br>what his passions has been and this is<br>illustrated with what follows I guess<br>he's been members and chairs of multiple<br>professional societies and service<br>community service organizations and<br>others Northern Regional Trust Board<br>deputy chair he's been president of the<br>open medico-legal society northern<br>clinical training network has been the<br>chair of that he's been the chair of the<br>training committee of the New Zealand<br>association of general surgeons he's<br>worked for the Ministry of Civil Defence<br>on the Planning Committee medical<br>practitioners disciplinary tribunal on<br>the right side of that and he's been<br>president of many trauma societies both<br>local and to<br>national and interestingly president of<br>the Association for the Advancement of<br>automotive medicine so he's one is<br>worrying how you're driving home tonight<br>he's legendary and teaching he's always<br>bumping me out of the lecture theatre<br>when he's coming in to hear his famous<br>trauma symposium to our fourth year<br>students because I always run over a<br>little and he corrects my mistakes and<br>IV fluid therapy he's also involved in<br>clinical teaching of the tis exams for<br>the fifth years and the vocational<br>training program as well in fact that we<br>really shines he somehow managed to<br>write 118 peer-reviewed journals of last<br>count for the high citation index he's<br>got mouth-watering amounts of money for<br>research which tends to annoy academics<br>who work a lot how to aggregate more<br>time to win that money is he's given or<br>written important editorial reviews and<br>reviews 40 or 50 of those sections and<br>books and about 150 invited lectures<br>many of these prestigious and named<br>lectures and inaugural lectures at<br>various things so in some professor<br>civil has achieved excellence and<br>clinical surgery clinical research<br>undergraduate and postgraduate teaching<br>professional training surgical<br>leadership and community service and<br>he's still in love with his wife<br>and his family adore him he's a generous<br>mentor to dozens of young surgeons his<br>opinion is sought and highly regarded by<br>appellate politicians health leadership<br>both locally and centrally in New<br>Zealand and overseas perhaps and all<br>this is done with charm and wit he holds<br>all his accomplishments lately and<br>modestly he's most unworldly in terms of<br>going for higher honours in fact i've<br>been at him for years to get to this<br>point when i was at some say but no he's<br>a man of high integrity and ability and<br>I honor you Ian I congratulate you on<br>this very natural recognition by the<br>University of Auckland to be a professor<br>in the Faculty of medical health<br>sciences looking forward to you for well<br>it's a huge pleasure and a great<br>privilege to be able to give this talk<br>what I've chosen to do is talk about<br>trauma and the differences between<br>trauma in the 1980s and trauma now and<br>along the way I think you will see<br>aspects of my career and my mentors I'm<br>aware that a lot of people in the<br>audience are non-medical and I should<br>just start out with a definition of what<br>i mean by trauma that was pointed out to<br>me by john wary who one of my teachers<br>when I was a medical student by email<br>just earlier this week that I should<br>remind the group about the other form of<br>trauma so I'm being very clear this is<br>not psychological trauma or mental<br>trauma I'm talking about I'm calling I'm<br>talking about trauma being physical<br>energy caused by physical injury caused<br>by energy transfer and there are the<br>common sorts blunt trauma penetrating<br>trauma and burns let's think back to the<br>1980s and what trauma was like at that<br>stage and there are a number of<br>parameters with which we saw trauma one<br>is that there was nothing like a trauma<br>system and I'll talk a little bit about<br>that as i go on injury prevention<br>initiatives were limited I know at the<br>time we thought they were quite<br>but by today's standards they were quite<br>limited road traffic safety was minimal<br>and again we would debate that if we<br>were here at the time but looking back<br>on it from this point we weren't<br>mandated to have seatbelts in the back<br>of our cars if we did have them they<br>could be the lap only belts which we now<br>recognize as being quite dangerous<br>certainly there were no airbags and<br>there were no median barriers in many<br>places including the harbour bridge and<br>injury care was provided by well-meaning<br>doctors and nurses who practiced based<br>on their belief about what was the right<br>thing to do with patients there was no<br>systematized approach to trauma care and<br>the result if we look at for example<br>road deaths in a population basis it was<br>that second peak that I'm talking about<br>in the 80s and the numbers there by<br>today's standards were extraordinary<br>this is a slide from that time reminding<br>us that in those days our road death<br>fatality rate was over 20 per hundred<br>thousand per year now we are well below<br>10 in fact were about eight four hundred<br>thousand per year so that was an<br>extraordinary road fatality rate one of<br>the other struggles we had is that<br>trauma severity was not defined so that<br>made it very difficult for research to<br>be undertaken in this area like trying<br>to do cancer research without a grading<br>system like talking about malignancy<br>without actually having a system to<br>grade it there was a grading system that<br>had been invented in the early 1970s it<br>was predominantly for road crash was<br>invented in the US but it was not in<br>widespread use and its applicability to<br>injuries other than road crash was<br>unknown so there's a there's a graphic<br>there of a road crash in 1979 and you<br>can see where you can imagine the sorts<br>of injuries that are trying to<br>illustrate a deer but there would have<br>been no way of actually comparing those<br>two patients and grading the likelihood<br>that one might survive and or or one<br>might not the paper that that produce<br>that scoring system is probably the most<br>cited page<br>in trauma I looked it up last week it's<br>got 4,000 citations and scopus and<br>although there have been many criticisms<br>it was the basis for grading injury<br>severity but having said that it's<br>didn't grade patients into those at risk<br>of complications and all the others so<br>we still it's like saying there's a<br>grading system for cancer but it didn't<br>grade them into you know a B C's and DS<br>so we were very limited in that regard<br>and clinical care was provided by<br>clinicians doing the best that they<br>could and the quality of care was<br>critically dependent on the experience<br>and skills of the individuals concerned<br>and there were undoubtedly significant<br>variations in relation to geography and<br>location this was the time when Don<br>trunki arguably the father of modern<br>trauma care I mean our adams cowley<br>might have been that because he invented<br>the Shock Trauma place in in Maryland<br>but Don is still around and donna's had<br>a much more profound and long-standing<br>influence on trawler he was the first<br>person to really point out that trauma<br>in it this paper was written in 1983 but<br>from the night late 1970s to early<br>eighties there was an epidemic of trauma<br>and we didn't understand it he pointed<br>out two really important facts one that<br>trauma and this is an argument for more<br>research money in trauma trauma<br>committed produced more lives lost than<br>the other two big areas which got a lot<br>of research money namely cancer and<br>heart disease predominantly because<br>trauma patients more then than now were<br>all young people and so the potential<br>lifespans that will lost too much<br>greater he also showed that there was a<br>try modal pattern of death and this is<br>something which I'll reflect on later we<br>have made a difference in so he showed<br>in that graph on the on the left-hand<br>side the immediate deaths for which were<br>a result of direct injury only injury<br>prevention could affect those the first<br>little lump which comes because we could<br>not manage effectively the ABCs the<br>airway breathing and circulation the<br>immediate life-threatening problems well<br>and then the later hump which was a<br>result of multiple<br>organ failure predicated by inadequate<br>management of of the vital it farts<br>airway breathing and circulation but not<br>that bad that the patients died so those<br>those factors were part of trauma care<br>in in the 1980s and we recognized it<br>here and it's funny when you look back I<br>had forgotten that we'd written this<br>paper but I look back and this is based<br>on some work I did when I was chief<br>registrar in 1983 looking at major<br>trauma at Auckland City Hospital<br>Auckland hospital as it was then there<br>were six hundred and two patients in<br>that year that came through the<br>resuscitation room and just 220 of those<br>subsequently had major trauma and the<br>mortality from that group was 26 or 27<br>percent and we just reflect on that<br>given our current mortality rates and<br>more strikingly the causes of death a<br>reasonable number of them died from<br>brain injury most of which would be hard<br>to prevent death severe brain injury is<br>something we still don't have an answer<br>for but the second group their<br>hemorrhage this is bleeding in the chest<br>bleeding in the abdomen bleeding<br>externally caused thirty-two percent of<br>all of these deaths and that is an<br>extraordinarily high number by today's<br>standards the issue of major trauma<br>being undefined was one of the first<br>areas i guess i turned my mind to with<br>my help with help from my colleagues and<br>intensive care how could we find a mark<br>that separated patients into those with<br>severe trauma or trauma likely to cause<br>morbidity and mortality and those with<br>minor trauma and and i think the the<br>research methods was pretty naive but<br>nonetheless we designed a study to look<br>at admissions for trauma and those of<br>you who have ever worked with professor<br>graham hill one of my mentors will<br>recognize the slide pattern here because<br>this is the format that we all use the<br>white on black slide and and we looked<br>at drama to try and determine whether<br>there was a cut point at which patients<br>or injured patients were at likely to<br>die or not and nobody had done this sort<br>of work before and here you can see we<br>show the<br>death became a possibility at 16 and<br>really became more likely at 25 this is<br>a scale that runs from 1 to 75 and at<br>the 75 in you're almost certain to die<br>at the more at the lower end you are<br>very unlikely to die in terms of major<br>injuries major surgery some patients get<br>get surgery at about level of nine but<br>generally at 16 and so this sort of work<br>helped define that major trauma in the<br>scoring system started at 16 which is<br>still the definition that we use today<br>with some minor modifications so what<br>did this mean this is Auckland Hospital<br>we're thinking of the 80s and reflect on<br>that epidemic thing 83 88 1993 studies I<br>did and you can see the patient number<br>of patients presenting to the<br>resuscitation room after trauma dramatic<br>increase number of trauma calls you'll<br>see later on we're peps getting past the<br>green number now but 778 trauma calls I<br>can't recall in recent times ever<br>getting close to that number it was a<br>huge number of chroma calls the number<br>of admissions to critical care were high<br>it did include children and that for<br>children aren't a very big component of<br>it and the numbers of major traumas were<br>increasing year by year what did it what<br>made up that trawler well motor vehicle<br>crash was a very big part of it as you<br>can see here in this pie chart that over<br>half of the patients the yellow segments<br>were motor vehicle occupants and if you<br>take all motor vehicle related crashes<br>or made a vehicle related injuries<br>including pedestrians and motorcyclists<br>almost three-quarters of all the severe<br>trauma admissions came from road crash<br>what did it look like well it looked a<br>little bit like this that's a resource<br>room at Auckland City ha squawk Lin<br>hospital in the 1980s sort of it looks a<br>bit you know random and just to put it<br>in context and and this this isn't from<br>1988<br>so that was that was the world that I<br>came back to after my trauma experienced<br>in New Jersey and had my first position<br>with the University which was commented<br>on and I have been employed by the<br>university since the 6th of October 1988<br>when I became senior lecturer in trauma<br>and military surgery so just for the<br>non-medical people I think a couple of<br>definitions or a few definitions just<br>what is a trauma system and what are<br>some of those four letter acronyms a<br>trauma system is defined in one of the<br>sort of standard textbooks for trauma as<br>an organized approach to the injured<br>patient in a defined geographical area<br>and it describes full and optimal care<br>and those are sort of a graphic there<br>which you can imagine centers local<br>departments transport etc another way of<br>describing it's in that second<br>definition it embraces the whole<br>spectrum of injury from the trivial to<br>the catastrophic from the moment it<br>occurs to the time of full recovery so<br>the full spectrum and it makes reference<br>there to the geographic areas which i<br>think is particularly relevant today as<br>we have introduced some national<br>destination policies that make sure<br>patients get to the right place at the<br>right time which is the key of a<br>functioning trauma system and some of<br>the things that are part of that<br>obviously a coordinating function data<br>collection retrieval services emergency<br>department specialized hospital services<br>ordered and quality insurance and<br>rehabilitation atls stands for advanced<br>trauma life support and it's a course<br>that was initiated after a light plane<br>crash in Nebraska claimed an orthopedic<br>surgeons family he himself was injured<br>and he felt that they needed to be some<br>way of getting a more organized approach<br>to the care of individuals so in his<br>particular situation that clinicians<br>involved in the care did not have an<br>approach<br>that resulted in a good outcome and he<br>designed together with the Lincoln<br>Medical Education Foundation a course<br>which has now run over 60 countries<br>that's been run in this part of the<br>world for about 25 and over a million<br>doctors have been trained EMS T stands<br>for the early management of severe<br>trauma and that is the same course but<br>in its early format we didn't want to<br>import the American course sort of lock<br>stock and barrel and perhaps in a<br>slightly parochial way we were allowed<br>or we decided to rewrite it that's a<br>copy of the manual there and myself<br>together with the three other surgeons<br>and anesthetist and a trauma nurse<br>coordinator were part of the early group<br>that introduced us into Australasia in<br>1988 it was made mandatory for surgical<br>trainees in 1993 and now we've run over<br>1,200 courses and over 20,000 doctors in<br>Australia and New Zealand have been<br>trained with this course DST C stands<br>for definitive surgical trauma care and<br>it's relevant for surgeons and its run<br>in all of those places where there are<br>red dots around the world it was<br>developed in Australasia and in Europe<br>in the late 1990s and it's now run in 30<br>countries with over 6,000 surgeons<br>trained and we've just finished doing a<br>course literally today our 13th course<br>in Auckland now there's a couple of<br>things that have changed since 1985 I<br>can't think what both of them are but<br>the trauma system injury prevention and<br>trauma care are the three areas that I'd<br>like to focus on I've talked a little<br>bit about what is a trauma system well<br>what is the evidence that we needed one<br>well Don trunki was out there again in<br>the late 1990s with this classic to<br>County study he looked at California and<br>in san francisco county he looked at 90<br>patients that were taken to San<br>Francisco General Hospital and<br>subsequently died after trauma and 90<br>ish patients that went to hospitals in<br>Orange County and what they found when<br>they looked at their causes of death and<br>their preventability that two-thirds of<br>the bleeding I the non CNS deaths<br>one third of the brain injury deaths in<br>the orange county would deemed to be<br>potentially preventable without a system<br>but only one of the ones going to San<br>Francisco General Hospital where they<br>were in a systematized way of care was<br>deemed to be preventable so his mantra<br>from this was that there needs to be a<br>system and subsequently he did a paper<br>which showed when Orange County changed<br>their mortality rate came down as well<br>looking at longitudinally Charlie Markel<br>and Mackenzie and others reviewed trauma<br>systems generally in the late 1990s and<br>they commented there are no randomized<br>control trials in this area most of the<br>evidence is level three at best but<br>whichever way you look at it and don<br>trunki study was a panel study but there<br>are other ways of looking at they all<br>showed a significant reduction in deaths<br>when there is a system that works does<br>it work locally well in Victoria they<br>had a report in the late 90s and<br>introduced a trauma system in 2000 which<br>is a very effective exemplar for us in<br>most other areas of Australasia and<br>looking at their results from 2001 to<br>2006 they showed that the mortality rate<br>dropped to nearly only sixty percent in<br>2006 compared to what it had been in two<br>thousand and following this data on it's<br>now down to forty percent of what it was<br>in two thousand so there is some<br>evidence that trawler systems do work so<br>what happened in New Zealand well at the<br>beginning of the 90s we were very<br>optimistic we sort of became a bit<br>neutral and then we became a bit<br>pessimistic but now we've become a bit<br>more optimistic again how did it all<br>start well sadly in New Zealand things<br>have we have to wait for a disaster<br>before we fix things and it's a very<br>it's it's it's problematic but this<br>journey started with a sentinel case and<br>I am aware that's very bad to use the<br>word journey in America in in World Cup<br>rugby years so I this is only relating<br>to this particular process this young<br>woman fell from a horse she was taken to<br>a provincial hospital she had a<br>hemothorax parents were reassured she<br>suddenly collapsed and died and she had<br>a massive hemothorax and the parents<br>questioned whether if<br>patient had been taken their daughter<br>had been taken to a bigger Hospital<br>whether in fact she would have got a<br>better care would have survived and they<br>took their complaint whether they went<br>to the help this is in the days before<br>the HDC they went to the health<br>department they wanted a royal<br>commission and fortunately the health<br>department and convinced them that that<br>wouldn't have been as productive as<br>something what might affect might make<br>make a difference to care to other<br>people and they commissioned the college<br>drama guide like a trauma committee to<br>write a set of guidelines which are<br>those on the left and blue completed in<br>1994 very similar to a document in<br>Australia in the middle which was<br>written about the same time and the<br>American College of Surgeons what they<br>call a gold book which contains the<br>elements of the requirements for good<br>care and this is the current version of<br>that book which was re republished in<br>most recently in 2012 and it defines<br>some of the things you need both the<br>physical things and the people things<br>that you need to have a good system so<br>that was a good start and that things<br>got better in the sense that under a<br>government in 1999 that's why at creech<br>a roadside to bedside policy was was put<br>out and this aim to produce a 24-hour<br>clinically indicated integrated acute<br>management system for New Zealand<br>probably this overreached things because<br>this was designed to deal not only with<br>trauma but medicine acute surgery<br>psychiatry and and acute obstetrics and<br>the parameters that the complexity of<br>that probably got beyond things and<br>although this was a great document you<br>can see it's got that same sect rules<br>chart that indicates you know a<br>systematized approach it didn't in most<br>areas really develop into anything<br>constructive and it took another<br>sentinel event in another area to really<br>get some development and in the Midland<br>area there was an event it went through<br>the HTC and the coroner and this was a<br>stimulus to a forward-thinking CEO<br>supported by some clinicians<br>establishing a trauma system not only in<br>the hole<br>spittle not only end up in in Waikato<br>Hospital but in the region and this has<br>been running for a number of years now<br>and I'm delighted that grants here in<br>the audience today because the Midland<br>regional trauma system has been running<br>and producing the sort of results that<br>could be produced nationally if we had a<br>good running national system but it only<br>happened in Midland and as you can see<br>from this editorial I got a bit<br>desperate and annoyed by the stage and<br>started writing things that suggested<br>that if we didn't do something<br>nationally soon we would miss our<br>opportunity to ever ever do it we were<br>given our chance we presented to the<br>Quality Improvement Committee grant and<br>I and although that was disbanded<br>shortly afterwards as often happens when<br>one presenter government committee you<br>find it goes out of action we were given<br>our time with the National Health Board<br>and as a result we got major trauma you<br>see it just nicked over the line but<br>like a medical student getting sort of<br>51% where the pass rates 50 we just got<br>over the line and got a tech to be one<br>of those services proposed for National<br>Service improvement and as a result we<br>have got to form the major trauma<br>national clinical Network which came<br>into place in 2012 and the purpose and<br>role of this is to provide leadership<br>and oversight and to produce a<br>consistent approach to trauma care in<br>New Zealand and so we have at least the<br>kernel to that these are some of the<br>terms of what these are the terms of<br>reference and I've highlighted two of<br>those in particular the one that says<br>providing advice and monitoring and<br>auditing of major trauma and informing<br>continuous quality improvement now you<br>can't do quality improvement unless you<br>have data and this has been one of the<br>focuses of the major trauma Network and<br>indeed it should be the focus of anyone<br>that's interested in result in trying to<br>get quality certainly when we form the<br>trauma service at Auckland City Hospital<br>this was one of the things that we did<br>at the very first right at the beginning<br>in December 1994 and we have had records<br>of every trauma patient admitted to<br>Auckland City Hospital since December<br>the 9th 1994 and currently<br>we have almost got 28,000 records in<br>that registry it allows us weekly audit<br>of all admissions and annual description<br>of trauma outcomes so some of the things<br>we can say and look at at ourselves are<br>that our mortality in this particular<br>decade 2000 2009 for blunt trauma was<br>14.5 percent not great but remember it<br>was twenty-six percent in 1983 and and<br>we can look at mortalities by each level<br>of injury severity score we can look at<br>things like length of stay and you can<br>see on the right there the chart which<br>shows length of stay for minor trauma or<br>three to four days and but for our major<br>trauma group seven to eight days and on<br>the little table that shows that in this<br>year anyway 2013 we had enough blunt<br>trauma patients to show that there was a<br>significant difference in our results to<br>that international average and the w<br>score means that one point two four more<br>survivors per hundred patients survived<br>then would have been expected by average<br>so that sort of data allows you to make<br>some comparisons not only with yourself<br>but with others his submit benchmarking<br>we did a few years ago with three trauma<br>systems in Australia showing difference<br>is in the the types of trauma you can<br>see on than the little line graph that<br>the Alfred which is the very big trauma<br>center in the in melbourne has more<br>major trauma that's the little bulge<br>over 20 to 40 then then the other<br>hospitals and much less minor trauma but<br>Newcastle which is the blue one has a<br>lot of minor trauma and much less in the<br>in the severe end of the spectrum and<br>the outcomes mortality wise actually<br>were the same in those systems length of<br>stay which is the table on the other<br>side shows some differences between them<br>and data can allow you to make those<br>comparisons and decide whether you've<br>got things to improve or not so the<br>major trauma Network our major focus is<br>being to get some data we've done we've<br>we've established a project to look at<br>some pre hospital mortality<br>understanding that about<br>eighty percent of all trauma deaths diet<br>patients die before they get to hospital<br>we've done a capacity and capability<br>report which shows that as we we sort of<br>knew that only seven out of the 20 DHBs<br>had trauma data that allowed them to say<br>anything about what they were doing and<br>we've established a minimum data set<br>we've now just one july established a<br>major trauma national registry we've got<br>data collection coming in from all 20<br>DHBs and we have made sure it's<br>compatible with the comp with a similar<br>data registry in Australia we have put<br>some data on the atlas of healthcare<br>variation which makes it public for all<br>this is interesting data which looks at<br>the incidence of trauma admissions so<br>for example down the the table there<br>those are numbers per thousand I can<br>only ever think in numbers per hundred<br>thousand per year I get focused by that<br>but so I've highlighted Lakes for<br>example which shows that 730 per hundred<br>thousand per year population get<br>admitted to hospital after trauma some<br>interesting variations tarafa t is the<br>highest actually of the lock down the<br>very bottom of that table eight hundred<br>and forty four hundred thousand per year<br>the lowest incidence is not on that<br>table because its weight a matar but<br>it's about 400 per hundred thousand per<br>year an Auckland City Hospital Auckland<br>DHB i should say sits in the middle at<br>five hundred and twenty four hundred<br>thousand per year some other data<br>looking at trauma mortality that very<br>factor that I highlighted originally<br>that twenty-six percent in that study in<br>Auckland and nineteen eighty-three we<br>have only data and this from the seven<br>hospitals that had some information but<br>here you can see numbers are all around<br>eleven nine eight eleven percent they<br>have highlighted Bay of Plenty eight<br>percent per eight percent of major<br>trauma mortality and the highest on that<br>list is about eleven percent a couple of<br>the other things that have come out of<br>the network a triage policy which is in<br>place which is designed to get patients<br>to the right place at the right time and<br>spinal cord injury destination policy<br>which we have also been associated with<br>promoting to make sure that very small<br>number of patients probably less than<br>one hundred a year who<br>paraplegia or quadriplegia after an<br>injury get as quickly as possible to the<br>spinal cord injury centers that can<br>perform surgery and if there is going to<br>be any potential for recovery either<br>partial or complete they can get it and<br>that's in place as well so let's think<br>about the trauma system how does that<br>compare in 2015 with 2085 1985 we've got<br>a registry we've got a destination<br>policy we've got some regions with hub<br>hospitals and we've got some<br>aspirational but not functional quality<br>improvement processes what about injury<br>prevention and traffic safety and just<br>as an aside so that bullseye on the<br>windscreen we don't see that very often<br>these days because the combination of<br>appropriate seatbelts and airbags means<br>that not many people get launched out of<br>their seat and strike their head and get<br>head face and c-spine injury one can't<br>think of this area without reflecting on<br>the head and matrix now bill hadn't<br>actually was one of the authors of that<br>injury severity paper I mentioned with<br>Susan Baker he was a you know one of the<br>legendary researchers in this area and<br>described injury prevention in terms of<br>human factors so this is like<br>advertising to convince us to be better<br>people better drivers better ladder<br>climbers better whatever vehicles and<br>equipment factors so making our car<br>safer making our ladder safer or<br>environmental factors I making the roads<br>safer in making other areas safer in<br>terms of how they how they develop and<br>you can see the matrix there is quite<br>complex and I won't dwell into all of<br>those things but think what's happened<br>over the course of the last 20 years in<br>1988 it was deemed to be a global<br>challenge and right now we're in the<br>decade of action for Road Safety looking<br>at elements of the head and matrix road<br>safety management safer roads safer<br>vehicles safer road users and<br>fortunately for us in the medical area<br>they have recognized that one of the<br>pillars is road safety is a better post<br>crash response no matter how all good<br>the other things are we will sadly still<br>see patients who have injuries and<br>there needs to be a good system to deal<br>with those my first exposure to this<br>however and we can see a for very<br>young-looking intensive care specialists<br>there was in the late 1980s being<br>involved in a process to try and<br>encourage median barriers on the harbour<br>bridge because almost every week<br>somebody would cross the median and<br>crash into somebody else causing death<br>and injury and it seemed such a simple<br>thing to fix and it actually had a very<br>small investment relatively in terms of<br>the potential outcome and this group and<br>you'll see almost all of those things<br>have been encouraged achieved I think<br>except I don't believe we have a<br>ministry for trauma of prevention but<br>this was one of those public things you<br>can see some of the media at the time<br>and this was a success story because<br>there were median berries on the Harbour<br>Bridge and it and although there are<br>crashes on the harbour bridge from time<br>to time the sorts of ones that were we<br>were getting in the 80s simply do not<br>occur anymore and if one looks at the<br>sorts of things one can do roadside<br>objects roadside barriers ceiling into<br>sections overtaking lanes all things<br>that can result in safer roads what<br>about speed and enforcement well we<br>actually increase the speed limit on<br>roads you know it was used to be 80<br>kilometres an hour up until the mid 80s<br>and then it was increased but we have a<br>lot of a lot of surveillance as we all<br>know high visibility patrols speed<br>cameras handheld radar detectors etc<br>alcohol has been another problem for us<br>in terms of injury and it was higher and<br>it has come down to 80 and now's come<br>down to 50 0 for those under 20 and<br>reduce the arrow blood alcohol from 2011<br>for the for the younger group and so<br>we're policing that we've made some<br>substantial changes in that seat belts<br>another area where the technologies<br>change so as I said before they didn't<br>even used to be necessary in the back<br>seat now they're not only necessary for<br>new cars but they need to be three-point<br>restraints we used to see this not<br>uncommon Lee this is a seatbelt sign and<br>a page<br>that's been wearing a lap only belt and<br>it is across the middle of their abdomen<br>and they have as a result had a small<br>bowel injury of mesenteric tear and this<br>is dead intestines which have developed<br>as a result of that injury so when can<br>argue was it better than nothing well it<br>possibly was better than being ejected<br>and getting a head injury but it<br>certainly was not the best form of<br>restraint and that fortunately has been<br>phased out our seatbelts have improved<br>dramatically both in terms of their<br>function and this is this is something<br>that I first learned about when I was<br>part of that organization that Brian<br>mentioned the Association for<br>advancement of automotive medicine<br>fascinating learning about the<br>engineering changes in cars that<br>resulted in a safer driving environment<br>be remiss of me not to mention the<br>activities of our children's safety<br>group because there's been a lot of<br>activity in improving child safety and<br>here's some examples Liz segun and james<br>hammell sarah white filmer over i<br>think's here somewhere all involved in<br>producing a safer environment lap only<br>belts there on the one hand driveway<br>related motor vehicle safety and the<br>other a lot of pediatric safety<br>initiatives so how does our safe road<br>safety environment can hear well i think<br>it is dramatically better and that<br>you'll see that in the results i'll show<br>for the current year outcomes child<br>restraint safer cars better road design<br>median barriers lower alcohol and more<br>stringent enforcement and finally what<br>about what about a systematized approach<br>to care what about care providers well<br>this is the orthopedic surgeon Jim<br>Steiner who was the one who survived<br>that plane crash who who said the<br>statement that's on the left there when<br>I can provide better care in the field<br>something is wrong and it has to be<br>changed and he did change it this course<br>was introduced as you can see it was<br>very formal in the early days this is a<br>first course we ever did at the College<br>in in Melbourne everyone sitting in in<br>rows behind like like kids in school in<br>the 1950s and 60s I suspect the course<br>was made available in Australasia and we<br>trained who we thought were the key<br>leaders interestingly enough<br>very people selected for the first<br>course who were at the time virtually<br>none of those had any subsequent<br>involvement in trauma it was all the<br>people we didn't select that put their<br>own hands up for the second third fourth<br>and fifth courses that made a difference<br>and the ones that were picked from the<br>top and elbow tapped and shoulder tapped<br>did not actually produce much there's a<br>younger II and civil teaching on this<br>course it's now mandated as I've said<br>since 1983 and the most recent course I<br>taught last month was number 12 hundred<br>and eighty eight which means that that<br>number of Surgeons on doctors i should<br>say have been taught we don't only teach<br>young doctor says of course we did the<br>marion davis post graduate center a few<br>years ago and you can see there are<br>gentlemen of fairly mature age being<br>taught and no one is to mature in their<br>career of their managing trauma patients<br>they can they're still able to be taught<br>these are some of the dynamic you can<br>see that we started off in 1988 and even<br>up until two thousand the number of<br>courses was fairly significant not only<br>surgeons being taught but also general<br>practitioners and Easter lyst emergency<br>physicians and intensivists and just a<br>blast from the past this is the very<br>first course outside the Marion Davis<br>Post Graduate Center and for those that<br>know them that's a very young Michael<br>hunter there we're just teaching on a<br>course with him this week that's a very<br>young Ellen surely there and and for<br>mark will show up there this is Jill<br>bishop who is our new clinical director<br>appointed to run our intensive care unit<br>Oakland City Hospital so over the course<br>of those those time we probably have<br>trained about 160 New Zealand as doctors<br>a year probably about 3,000 new zealand<br>doctors over the last 25 years the dscc<br>course as I mentioned developed in the<br>early nineteen late 1990s and over 200<br>courses conducted in 4,000 surgeons<br>trained and we've been running this in<br>Auckland since 2003 we've just been<br>running it this week this is some of the<br>participants on an earlier course and i<br>can see roses in the audience sub J<br>frontier and Alex had been just running<br>this course<br>and and this has trained over 200<br>surgeons to look after injured patients<br>after that first hour or so when the<br>vital you know airway breathing and<br>circulation have been dealt with so how<br>has this affected this tri modal pattern<br>of death that Don trunki outlined in<br>1983 well gene more in Denver and he's<br>perhaps one of the most prolific trauma<br>writers looked at this actually in the<br>late 1990s and showed that this growth<br>the graphics sanguine nation in<br>particular did not seem to be try modal<br>at all there were some patients with<br>head injuries was a little bump there<br>but their conclusion was that this tri<br>modal pattern didn't exist we actually<br>looked at it in 2004 where one of our<br>fellows looked at all trauma deaths in<br>Auckland region in 2004 and just as an<br>aside you can see the disturbing number<br>of hangings that were part of that<br>particular cohort 186 deaths in in that<br>particular group and you can see a range<br>of mechanisms of injury we looked at the<br>cause of death the vast majority were<br>CNS head injury related deaths and and<br>hemorrhage was a very much smaller<br>component than was the case in 1983 so<br>patients weren't dying of bleeding to<br>death and fact when we looked at the<br>timing of deaths and took her out there<br>the hangings out of this analysis we<br>found no evidence of a try modal pattern<br>at all suggesting that the system and<br>the care providers were now doing as<br>much as they reasonably could to stop<br>the effects of shock once the patient<br>got into the healthcare system in the<br>pre-hospital and hospital environment<br>clearly the fact that there's a big peak<br>early on is a reflection of the fact<br>that injury prevention sadly is not<br>perfect so what are the differences did<br>that make now there are children in this<br>earlier graph so the numbers are<br>intentional I klee to be a little bit<br>low here but they're not that much lower<br>you can see the number of trauma calls<br>in the last three years last decade i<br>should say in three particular cohorts<br>2014 2009<br>2005 are still not up to the numbers<br>that we were getting in 1990 the number<br>of admissions to intensive care have<br>dropped right back not 300 only 124 last<br>year and the number of major trauma<br>cases is not changing in the way that it<br>was in the 80s where we got up to 360 in<br>the in 1990 so that amount of trauma has<br>dropped back if we compare them the<br>mechanisms on the left side that graph I<br>showed you previously with 75 percent or<br>nearly seventy five percent came from<br>motor vehicle crash and look at the<br>relevant parts of this pie chart the<br>twenty one percent plus the eight<br>percent plus the nine percent only<br>thirty-seven percent came from motor<br>vehicle crash so motor vehicle crashes<br>virtually halved in between 1983 as a<br>cause of major trauma coming to hospital<br>what about the causes of death is the<br>chart from that old old studies showing<br>that thirty two percent had hemorrhage<br>as a cause of death here we go in 2014<br>eight percent from hemorrhage and I even<br>think that's probably an over estimate<br>because it's a very very rare event now<br>in hospital to get somebody<br>exsanguinating to death they often have<br>other things and they may have big<br>hemorrhage they may die from the other<br>things but to be the primary cause of<br>death is very uncommon and trauma<br>mortality was twenty-six percent but<br>year before last anyway was only eight<br>point six percent in our cohort so does<br>how does it compare on and there's Tony<br>Smith in a trauma call last week down<br>the bottom and our team already with<br>their labels on ready to receive a<br>patient at the top all trauma care<br>providers speak a common language the<br>language is promoted by the early<br>management is to be a trauma course<br>there's a general understanding of the<br>nature of time critical presentations<br>and we have Ana standardized approach<br>with guidelines either institutional<br>guidelines or overarching guidelines<br>critical decision making is in is<br>appreciated and expedited deaths from<br>hemorrhage have gone down and mortality<br>is more than halved we still have trauma<br>this is from a paper<br>The Herald just you know in the last<br>couple of months and we still get it we<br>still need to be prepared but I believe<br>we're doing it a lot better we've got a<br>trauma system it's got a lot of work to<br>do but we've had we have it in<br>development injury prevention<br>initiatives compared to the 80s are<br>advanced we have a lot of road safety<br>initiatives now that we didn't have<br>before an injury compared in injury care<br>systematic and you can see the road<br>fatality result has dropped right down<br>to about eight per hundred thousand per<br>year I'd like to thank you all for being<br>part of this presentation those are some<br>of the people who have been along this<br>way with me many of whom have made<br>substantial contributions to my career<br>both pit both at a family level and at a<br>at a professional level and I'd like to<br>thank you all for the the honor you've<br>done by coming along tonight for my<br>lecture thank you very much thank you<br>very much he in my name is Ian visit I'm<br>the head of the university department of<br>surgery and I have the great privilege<br>of responding to this outstanding<br>lecture Ian it's been oh I tour de force<br>through what's happened in the last 30<br>years and in trauma you've also<br>demonstrated that dogged perseverance at<br>collecting accurate information over a<br>very long period is important in<br>understanding what's happening and in<br>making changes what we have been able to<br>see from that is significant<br>improvements and outcome for patients<br>we've also been able to see that<br>patients are now managed in different<br>ways from what they were before and<br>often in non-surgical ways so fewer<br>people are being operated on fewer<br>people are dying unfortunately there's<br>still some injuries that we do need to<br>operate on one of those is a stab to the<br>heart and I took on acute surgery on<br>acute trauma on call in the late 90s and<br>I was pretty confident at managing most<br>injuries but I used to actually lie<br>awake at night wondering<br>I do if I get someone stabbed in the<br>heart will they be able to manage that I<br>still remember late one night getting<br>the call going to the emergency<br>department a person with a stab injury<br>in the chest if blood pressure was<br>dropping they had a cardiac tamponade<br>we'd rush them up to theatre I go into<br>the theater room and to my amazement<br>there was he in civil he'd come in in<br>the middle of the night he was getting<br>changed as well I thought great he'll be<br>able to do this operation for me now<br>that's not Ian's way actually so Ian<br>came into theatre he didn't scrub up he<br>stood in the background I scrubbed up I<br>opened the chest I opened the<br>pericardium and then I had to try and<br>get my tremor in time with the heartbeat<br>so I could stitch the heart cooley Ian<br>still in the background and gave words<br>of encouragement and as soon as the<br>heart was repaired and the patient was<br>stable he slipped out of theater that<br>patient did well my next step in the<br>heart also did well and Ian wasn't there<br>that time I'm one surgeon amongst<br>hundreds probably thousands across<br>Australia in New Zealand who've been<br>trained by ian to manage torma I don't<br>think it's an exaggeration that every<br>surgeon in New Zealand who manages<br>trauma has been taught by interval<br>because of Ian we are now safer in New<br>Zealand then we were 30 years ago and<br>I'd like you to join me in thanking him<br>thank you all for coming this evening<br>and this is really just for me to close<br>proceedings and remind you that tomorrow<br>night professor chris bullard will be<br>presenting all the lecture at timothy<br>campus so thank you again for coming<br>tonight and have a safe journey home</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
