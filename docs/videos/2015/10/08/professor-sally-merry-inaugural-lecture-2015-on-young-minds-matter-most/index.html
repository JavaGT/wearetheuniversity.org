name k well k900<br>came out in our mana and our AO and I<br>however tena culture can I call<br>sohcahtoa firstly thank you rob waiting<br>for a wonderful blessing and the team<br>for a wonderful song good evening and<br>welcome John Fraser the dean of the<br>faculty medical health sciences and it's<br>my very great pleasure to welcome both<br>colleagues family and friends here to<br>the seventh in our series of seven<br>inaugural lectures for 2015 inaugural<br>lectures for those of you who are<br>unfamiliar with the process are in fact<br>one of the highlights of our academic<br>calendar and as I said before this is a<br>record year for our faculty with we have<br>seven new professors and tonight it's my<br>very great pleasure to introduce<br>professor Sally Mary firstly I'd also<br>like to acknowledge that Sally is in<br>fact viam has an endowed chair The Dukes<br>family cure kids cheer and Adolescent<br>Mental Health and I'd especially like to<br>welcome Roy Austin and dill and Stuart<br>from fewer kids who are also here<br>tonight inaugural lectures are a<br>tradition that date back for many<br>hundreds of years they date back to<br>medieval times in those days<br>universities were in fact small posted<br>groupings of professors they were an<br>elite Brotherhood people were elected<br>into the Brotherhood by the other<br>members they protected one another they<br>lived in cloistered surroundings array<br>away from the real world answerable only<br>to themselves and to the esoteric<br>interests while at the same<br>I'm being expected to be remunerated at<br>a high rate just for being smarter than<br>everyone else I'll leave it to you<br>decide whether things have changed much<br>since those days they are a tradition<br>that hasn't changed much in many<br>hundreds of years and they are in fact<br>the university's way of publicly<br>announcing its new professors they are<br>in fact a way of showcasing our most<br>eminent staff and the celebration of an<br>event that presents for many a pinnacle<br>of one's academic career elevation to<br>the title of professor was not something<br>that has taken lightly the proof for the<br>process of selection is long and<br>involved it requires intense scrutiny by<br>international peers who then confirm to<br>the University that the individual or<br>the appointee has reached a level of<br>international repute and imminence and<br>expert in their field thus giving them a<br>license to say anything they like about<br>their subject and the sure knowledge<br>that people will believe them inaugural<br>lectures are also a wonderful<br>opportunity for colleagues friends and<br>family to gather together to celebrate<br>and to learn about the journey that has<br>taken the person to this point of<br>academic success the milestones the<br>decisions sometimes the heartbreaks but<br>most importantly the mentors have<br>assisted along the way so without<br>further ado I'd like to invite professor<br>Philippa Paul who is the head acting<br>head of the school of medicine to<br>provide some introductory remarks Philip<br>tena koutou katoa a me marvel gallery<br>thank you<br>not a material now how is that so you've<br>heard and that salary is the Cure cuts<br>in Duke Family chair and child mental<br>adolescent mental health she's also be<br>head of the Department of psychological<br>medicine and the director of the weary<br>Center so she's very busy person it's my<br>absolute pleasure to introduce you so<br>following a medical degree in Rhodesia<br>Sally moved to New Zealand in 1979 and<br>started off as a house officer and<br>Rotorua she then decided to train as a<br>psychiatrist and that took her to the UK<br>and then to Auckland where she settled<br>for a series of clinical and academic<br>posts she was appointed formally as a<br>lecturer a senior lecturer in the<br>Department of psychological medicine and<br>that 2001 members of Sally's staff<br>report that she's a bit of a superwoman<br>alright so some quotes Sally looks after<br>who team and credibly well we feel lucky<br>to work with her note worth rather than<br>for her sally has a gift of persuading<br>us no matter how big or in bushes are<br>projectors we can do it we sometimes so<br>she's got hypnotic powers because we<br>always leave meetings feeling upbeat and<br>energized so another no doubt that<br>attitude has helped her achieve 78<br>peer-reviewed papers summon prestigious<br>journals she's edited to box and minute<br>and 13 book chapters she's had grads in<br>excess of 8 million dollars in his<br>frequently invite as a keynote speaker<br>and adjourn<br>reviewer for very top journals she's<br>been a member of the Prime Minister's<br>youth mental health expert reference<br>group and as a leader of the mbie better<br>start national science challenge she's<br>been an excellent condition until quite<br>recently and teacher and as well as<br>being remarkably technologically savvy<br>which puts some of us to shame<br>commendably her work as dedicated as<br>you're here towards better lives the<br>young people especially those from<br>disadvantaged backgrounds and Sally's<br>career has already earned her multiple<br>awards including a Dean's Award for her<br>md thesis UN and UNESCO of commendations<br>for his sparks online computer program<br>intended to help young people with<br>depression and 2014 she was voted the<br>next magazine's health in science woman<br>of the year so Sally's the fairer half<br>of Professor Alan merry way to put it<br>the firer her and Alan is currently<br>enjoying a sabbatical from his duties as<br>head of the school to midst and she's<br>also the mother of three children who<br>would have and I think one is here<br>tonight so that tonight really is<br>Sally's night and we look forward to<br>hearing all about your professional and<br>personal journey and afford two or

tena koutou tena<br>koutou tena koe tocarte TOA thank you<br>very much everybody for and being here<br>tonight it's very lovely to see be<br>seeing you all I just get this out I<br>come from our Wales but from a very<br>scattered family in my Mountain is Kevin<br>Britain in the Gower coast and my<br>grandparents were the bells from Swansea<br>and Harvey's from Kevin forest both in<br>South Wales and my mother particularly<br>but both my parents were enormous<br>travellers that's my mother there on the<br>on the far left on the boat she took off<br>when she was 17 from home and traveled<br>to India to Italy to North Africa to<br>Australia and then she traveled from<br>Australia to Cape Town to start on the<br>Cape to Cairo trip she had met my father<br>during the war and this was in the early<br>1950s my father had meanwhile travel to<br>what was then Southern Rhodesia and she<br>reunited with my father and they got<br>married and is there ridding photograph<br>so I was I grew up in Zimbabwe and my<br>River is the young gon be River which is<br>in the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe and<br>a place where where our family spent<br>many happy holidays our home was<br>actually in Harare which was a lovely<br>tree-lined town cities officially but<br>quite small and for the first six years<br>of my life I was an only child raised by<br>parents who I think were very warm and<br>caring but I was little lonely and you<br>can actually see I have my doll there<br>Angela who was a big companion<br>and I pestered my parents for a brother<br>or a sister so I was very delighted when<br>my sister was born when I was six and we<br>have many family photos of me and my<br>sister growing up so there's my sister's<br>honor and zan is here with us tonight<br>and she's not only a very dear sister<br>which is actually a very close friend<br>and being a wonderful support and we've<br>traveled a very long journey together so<br>it's been lovely to have her in New<br>Zealand as well as well as her lovely<br>husband Jeff during our teenage years<br>the bush war came in in in Rhodesia it<br>was udi and the very peaceful country<br>that I started off in I realized was not<br>as perfect as i had thought when i was a<br>child i did my medical training they met<br>alan lee and we got married as medical<br>students and after my p gy 1 year we<br>lift Zimbabwe and traveled to New<br>Zealand we were lured by a description<br>of a lovely town by the mountains close<br>to skiing close to trout fishing and<br>misseldon them in the forests and we I<br>so we were a little surprised when we<br>first arrived but it was wonderful and<br>actually I mean New Zealand just blew us<br>away from the moment we got here we had<br>such a warm welcome there unfortunately<br>there didn't actually have any senior<br>doctors so being junior doctors there we<br>were in a slightly difficult position so<br>we move fairly quickly across to Rotorua<br>where we got used to the idea of a very<br>impermanent landscape with boiling mud<br>and geysers and steam coming out of the<br>out of the gutters which was quite<br>extraordinary to us having grown up on<br>the very ancient plateau in the middle<br>of Africa from there I went and decided<br>to do psychiatry and my first job was in<br>king Sita I'm a little sad that King<br>seat now has got the sort of whole<br>reputation of spook a--'s and so on<br>certainly when I was there we had quite<br>a warm therapeutic community we did use<br>rather heroic doses of medication in<br>those days but the I worked with some<br>very fine consultant some Eileen and<br>Graham Evans and Alan Fraser among a<br>number of others we relocated the family<br>and I don't know if you can actually<br>spot the head of school in the back<br>there<br>and there's our first daughter Kate and<br>my parents who came over to New Zealand<br>and loved it and Alan's mother came over<br>and XANA joined us soon afterwards so<br>for us New Zealand was an enormously<br>positive place it felt like a land of<br>milk and honey and I think for us it<br>really was and we've settled very<br>happily and I've been very pleased to<br>raise our children here and I think<br>we're now very identified as kiwis so<br>now i would like to claim manga ray as<br>my mountain and the Tamaki history as my<br>River having had children I am I wanted<br>to work part time and I embarked on<br>having 15 years years of preschoolers<br>which wasn't entirely planned to have<br>them quite so spread out and of career<br>and job sharing and Parenthood and I did<br>a lot of job sharing with Leah Andrews<br>and John wary said Leah and I off on<br>research career with our health research<br>council grant to look at the psychiatric<br>status that sexually abuse children 12<br>months after disclosure of abuse Leah<br>not only alia and I not only shared this<br>research position we wrote book together<br>along with Sylvia burn agra fort on<br>teenage depression had many clinical<br>jobs together and Louise and Leah and I<br>actually job shared a half-time position<br>academic position in the Department of<br>psychological medicine Louise also had a<br>research fellowship and Leah and Louise<br>and I have had many discussions about<br>career over the years and Leah went<br>along the line of I'm teaching and has<br>developed a lot of the very good<br>teaching programs that we've actually<br>got in the department now Louise decided<br>that actually her first love was music<br>and she's now composing for the APO as<br>well as being a wonderful performer and<br>we're very proud of her but I think John<br>where he probably isn't so pleased that<br>she didn't do so much research<br>I just like to acknowledge John<br>professor John wary the foundation<br>professor of psychiatry who was head of<br>department when I first started working<br>in the department and professor Rob kid<br>who was head of department for the most<br>of the time that I was there and both<br>John and Rob were really good sports I<br>think about tolerating the job sharing<br>that we did I think rob was some<br>particularly good when we actually said<br>three of us wanted to share a half-time<br>position and he was a little taken aback<br>but but he gave it a go and it was it<br>was it was very successful but New<br>Zealand isn't so positive for everybody<br>and not all families have as good a time<br>as we had New Zealand has the fifth<br>birth chart abuse record out of 31 OECD<br>countries on average one child has<br>killed every five weeks most of these<br>children are under five and in fact the<br>biggest group is under one years old<br>ninety percent of all child deaths are<br>perpetrated by someone the child new and<br>child abuse is very expensive costing<br>New Zealand over two million dollars<br>each year and I think we all remember<br>Chris and crew car who either twins who<br>were killed when they were three months<br>old and they're just one example of many<br>many children have actually lost their<br>lives we also have high youth suicide<br>statistics overall youth suicide is the<br>biggest killer of young people and 19<br>100,000 die every year the rates for<br>Maori a two-and-a-half times those four<br>non-maori and although it's declined<br>since 1995 our decline has been much<br>less than other countries in the OECD so<br>that we still retain the dubious<br>distinction of vying with Finland for<br>having the highest youth suicide<br>statistics in the in the OECD we also<br>know that mental problems of mental<br>health are very common one in four<br>children will suffer from a mental<br>illness and fifty percent of melted<br>mental illness starts before the age of<br>14 despite this our blue printers access<br>in specialist services for one to five<br>percent of the population and twenty<br>percent will suffer from depressive<br>disorder before the age of 18 and about<br>eighty percent of this<br>untreated mental illness is very<br>expensive to society and to individuals<br>depressive disorder is more expensive<br>than heart disease diabetes and Stroke<br>nurses from a study done by the World<br>Health Organization and the World Bank<br>and conduct disorder will affect five to<br>ten percent of the population and has<br>long-term securely it persists into<br>adulthood its associated with<br>delinquency and crime substance abuse<br>suicidal thoughts and attempts and the<br>costs estimated in the UK were one to<br>two million pounds per single prolific<br>offender these two are linked as well<br>and this is um this is a study from that<br>was actually done from the longitudinal<br>studies done in New Zealand that is<br>actually looking at the gene environment<br>interaction and the sexy shows that if<br>you have a particular genetic<br>predisposition with two short alleles<br>and you are abused your rates of<br>depression about double was if you have<br>the two long alleles it's about the same<br>as the population and if you have one of<br>each it falls in between this sort of<br>gene in and environment interaction<br>holds also for suicide and also holds<br>for conduct disorder and we have some<br>understanding of this from the studies<br>done by michael meanie with his rats i<br>think you know that rats will lick and<br>groom their babies and they fall on a on<br>a bell curve for that so the michael<br>mean he's actually taken the very high<br>liquors and groomers the very caring<br>rats and he has had a look at what<br>happens to their offspring and he's also<br>had a look at the ones on the other end<br>of the spectrum the ones who which are<br>somewhat neglectful and we know that the<br>offspring of the grooming rats are much<br>more chilled out and confident than the<br>rats of the neglectful mothers who are<br>very stressed we also know that this is<br>linked to a gene environment interaction<br>it's not an inborn feature it's actually<br>to do with the unlocking or locking of<br>the gene that leads to the<br>glucocorticoid receptors in epic<br>us we're going to go into that too much<br>but but what this means is that the<br>ability to modulate the stress response<br>is affected by the parenting that the<br>rats get so that you actually get a<br>picture where if you don't get the<br>grooming you actually have a much more<br>difficult time responding to stress we<br>see this in real life I'm the Romanian<br>orphans who actually had very good care<br>in terms of being feared and being<br>clothed were also emotionally neglected<br>we know that long-term this actually<br>leads to a raft of psychological<br>problems including autistic spectrum<br>picture ADHD later depression and so on<br>we know that we can actually pretty much<br>improve those if you actually adopt them<br>before the age of six months but the<br>later you adopt them the more ill<br>effects that you actually get the need<br>for care is sort of universal across the<br>animal kingdom but when you get to<br>people it's actually not only it's not<br>only the holding and stroking and so on<br>that's important it's also the quality<br>of the social interaction very early<br>babies arch born tuned social<br>interaction this is my grandson heady<br>and I'll just play your little clip he's<br>the ability to tune into a baby like<br>that actually impacts on the brain<br>development and is what leads to having<br>confident toddlers so this is some petty<br>age 2 at a recent skiing trip with his<br>father and it's not only the mothers but<br>its fathers and all the adults around<br>the babies that are so important in this<br>but not all children get in early<br>background like this and this is an<br>example of a child that we have actually<br>failed this is Bailey Jr junior career<br>icky he's the 12 year old who was<br>involved in and was convicted for the<br>men's ruler of the pizza delivery man<br>when he was when he was just 12 years<br>old this child was the youngest of eight<br>children born to a mother who had been a<br>state ward and had left home when she<br>was 14 years old his father was in jail<br>for in for in for violence and attacks<br>on his mother and he was brought to the<br>notice of charges and family many times<br>in his early life by the age of five he<br>was already showing major major<br>difficulties at school and when he was<br>involved in the group that was involved<br>in the murder of the pizza delivery men<br>he was 12 years old and he'd been on the<br>streets for two years so this is a child<br>who we completely failed in his early<br>life and I think his mother obviously<br>needed more support than she got we<br>failed him again in adolescence we put<br>him in jail at the age of 12 and he<br>stayed there for seven years he's in<br>since been out and he's being convicted<br>on drug offenses and on assault and from<br>the descriptions in the newspaper it<br>sounds as if he has major problems with<br>substance use and major problems with<br>mood disorder and it's such a shame<br>because during adolescence the<br>adolescent brain is more plastic than it<br>will ever be again it's capable of<br>remarkable adaptability it's a time of<br>huge synaptic pruning and it's a time<br>which we have when we can actually<br>remove<br>what's actually happened in early life a<br>lot of most mental disorders actually<br>start through the teenage years and if<br>you actually have a look at the the<br>thing on the bottom here any mental<br>illness the majority starts on average<br>just below the age of 15 so if we're<br>going to intervene we have two key<br>periods when we can actually think about<br>making a real difference for young<br>people and so when I was actually seeing<br>people in in various clinical services<br>which always seemed to be overly busy we<br>always seem to have a waiting list there<br>were always too many people to see then<br>I had time to see I started thinking<br>that it would be important to try and<br>take a national approach I was not the<br>first person to think about this this<br>was an idea that actually came from<br>Professor John wary who spent the 1990s<br>talking about the need for an institute<br>in Child and Adolescent Mental Health<br>which was a reefs which was a center of<br>excellence that did excellent research<br>and teaching and supported the workforce<br>and advocated for the needs of young<br>people Rob kid then noted that the<br>minister that the then clinical training<br>agency had an RFP out for a training<br>center and encouraged me and Leah and<br>Louise Glinda Chad and Heather McDonald<br>and Tanya cargo to to put in a bid for<br>the funding for that and so we did we<br>were successful in getting funding for<br>that and that led to the development of<br>the weary scent of a child and<br>adolescent mental health the very center<br>is proud on predominantly a research and<br>teaching center it's in the department<br>of psychological medicine and it but it<br>has a very strong and large workforce<br>development arm as well so everything<br>John tells us to do we do you see we've<br>always been very obedient that way it's<br>we we attempt to run it in accordance<br>with the treaty of waitangi and I'd like<br>to acknowledge two and very key people<br>who have been a part of it one is<br>robbery and fair amate who has been co<br>martyr for the weary sinter since its<br>inception and has also been commercial<br>for research that I've been doing since<br>the 1990s and it's been a wonderful<br>journey to have trod with you Rory and<br>thank you very much for that the other<br>person might surprise you a little at<br>some professor it's distinguished<br>professor Ian Reed who's head of the<br>bone group and when we were setting up<br>research and I was thinking about how we<br>might try to create a big and strong<br>team that was well funded I am I looked<br>around a ins Brown group is<br>internationally renowned and well-funded<br>and so I asked him if I could pick his<br>brains about how to do it and over many<br>coffees and a few wines ian has given me<br>some very practical and sensible advice<br>some of which was not really exactly<br>what i was expecting so I was expecting<br>him to say right smart papers and so on<br>and he at one point he said to me your<br>job is just to get funding you need to<br>get funding so thank you to both of you<br>and I'd like to tell you a little bit<br>about some of the research now that<br>we've actually done to try and address<br>these very important problems and this<br>is a this was this comes from a master's<br>student of mine who's then gone on to do<br>her PhD with me and they're still<br>working with me and this is a project<br>done by Terry Fleming using data from<br>the youth 2000 series of studies youth<br>2000 studies have been done in 2001 2007<br>2012 and they're planning the next run<br>these are very large cross-sectional<br>studies looking at the health and<br>well-being of young people in New<br>Zealand secondary school students and<br>Terry's master's thesis was around<br>self-reported suicide attempts and<br>associated risk and protective factors<br>among secondary school students she<br>showed that suicide attempts were common<br>and that we weren't actually getting to<br>hear about all of them but the key thing<br>about this is that she showed in her<br>analyses that the factors that had the<br>biggest odds ratios were depression<br>alcohol abuse by family violence and<br>non-heterosexual orientation in terms of<br>risk for<br>suicide attends these risk factors were<br>also supported from a literature review<br>that I was involved with with an H burr<br>tray and also by work done by David<br>Ferguson in the longitudinal study in<br>Christchurch that actually showed<br>particularly that disturbed an unhappy<br>family background and mental health<br>problems including mood disorders are<br>particularly important if your turn to<br>try and address suicide and suicide<br>attempts so a little bit about<br>depression twenty to twenty-five percent<br>of of young people suffer from very<br>significant lowered mood during their by<br>the age of 18 and eighty percent of this<br>is untreated the mainstays of treatment<br>medication and talking therapies<br>especially cognitive behavioral therapy<br>and interpersonal therapy but we have a<br>number of barriers for accessing therapy<br>that include a lack of therapists a lack<br>of recognition of depression and a lack<br>of training opportunities and so I was<br>thinking about what would you do to<br>impact on depression across a nation<br>partly influenced by my experiences in<br>Africa where I saw the results of a very<br>successful immunization campaign against<br>measles which resulted in a big decrease<br>in the number of complications from<br>measles and then during the war this<br>gradually unfolded and a lot of the<br>services fell away and we had a massive<br>increase in the number of children<br>presenting with measles complications in<br>the tertiary Center the Institute of<br>Medicine has a cycle of change going<br>from prevention through treatment and<br>through treatment maintenance and this<br>encouraged us to think about supporting<br>a national stepped care approach<br>thinking about could you prevent the<br>onset of depression and how might you<br>increase the reach of treatment the idea<br>of preventing the onset of depression<br>was very appealing and this was one of<br>the first big studies that that I<br>actually led along with Heather McDonald<br>who ran the study with me and this is a<br>bicultural randomized placebo-controlled<br>trial of a school-based depression<br>prevention program<br>we used the resourceful adolescent<br>program which had actually been<br>developed in Australia we adapted it for<br>use here we developed a placebo program<br>and we ran a big randomized control<br>trial this is an 11 session program run<br>in groups by teachers in schools and we<br>actually showed that you can actually<br>reduce depression and keep the rates<br>down this is the intervention group over<br>18 months whereas our placebo group you<br>can see was much less effective and this<br>is a time when you would normally expect<br>that the rates of depression to be going<br>up so we and I think when we first did<br>the study we thought we might go to the<br>Ministry of Education having shown that<br>it was wonderful and encourage them to<br>roll roll this out nationally in fact<br>running the trial changed our minds it<br>was very difficult to get the teachers<br>to stick to the curriculum and it was<br>very clear if we went to attempt to<br>national rollout we had to find<br>something that was more acceptable to<br>him they didn't like 11 scripted<br>sessions they wanted to be able to adapt<br>it to their classes and they wanted to<br>have some say in the way it was done so<br>there would have been one option but at<br>about that stage Anthony Rogers<br>approached me and said we should<br>actually look at putting rap onto mobile<br>phones and so with Robin Whittaker we<br>applied for another health research<br>council grant and tried to put cognitive<br>behavioral therapy on to a mobile phone<br>and this is a program called MIMO<br>positive space so we used an some<br>advertising people to actually help us<br>come up with us and we actually sent the<br>program out in little clips on mobile<br>phones and again we did a big randomized<br>placebo-controlled trial this time with<br>900 people we used we had a lot of<br>cartoons we use their broton format I am<br>related to the feedback that we'd<br>actually had from young people and I'll<br>show you a little bit of what the 60<br>looks like you would get the song to<br>why aren't you answering your text bro<br>there no feelings think bout being<br>grounded that's why you should talk to<br>your mates why so I can make you feel<br>stink too done if you feel low you<br>should call your bros spose hey you want<br>to be grounded on me today thought you'd<br>never ask for see green zone just leave<br>for good times when you feel alive go<br>so em to the delight of clinical<br>psychologists we've have reduced<br>cognitive behavioral therapy to three<br>words spots short and do unfortunately<br>having done there at the very rigorous<br>randomized control trial we actually<br>showed we were able to impart the<br>cognitive behavioral therapy constructs<br>to the intervention group our control<br>group was healthy eating and saving the<br>planet and we were able to impart those<br>constructs to them and unfortunately at<br>the end of 12 months we did not have a<br>difference in depression between the two<br>groups it just shows that you actually<br>do need research to see whether or not<br>you're having an effect we then thought<br>about actually am treatment and in the<br>early part of the century there was a<br>thought that if you can't recognize<br>you're not recognizing depression enough<br>and there's effective treatment that is<br>medication maybe what you should do is<br>actually have a big screening program<br>and put everybody on medication and this<br>was some this was before the black box<br>warning over the over the<br>antidepressants for young people and we<br>did a big meta-analysis looking at<br>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors<br>and their effect for young people and I<br>think I'm not so convinced that it does<br>terribly much harm although it<br>definitely does increase the risk of<br>self-harm the big thing that came out of<br>this meta-analysis is that they don't<br>work very well fluoxetine maybe has some<br>effect but the other medications<br>probably work for individual people but<br>if you actually aggregated all they're<br>not enormously effective so we had to<br>look for a different idea and so also if<br>you're not seeing most depression in<br>secondary services where might you see<br>it and the answer is in primary care and<br>so we have a look at and the potential<br>for a therapy and at this point I need<br>to declare a conflict of interest the<br>development team and I stand to gain<br>financially if we would ever make any<br>money from sparks<br>as I'd like to talk about the<br>development of a new therapy and this<br>idea and she came from a GP friend of<br>mine who actually said you should put<br>CBT cognitive behavioral therapy onto a<br>computer it was my pleasure to be<br>working with károly Nastasia at that<br>time and carolina was looking for a PhD<br>project and she very gamely tackled us<br>and developed a computer program<br>flash-based program on very small budget<br>she also developed a a placebo program<br>and she piloted it and showed that it<br>was effective and this was in the<br>springboard to allow us to get funding<br>from the Ministry of Health to develop<br>sparks and I talked about starts in in<br>in many settings but basically sparks<br>uses a game format to deliver cognitive<br>behavioral therapy it's backed by a lot<br>of evidence including elearning theory<br>techniques so we actually have a<br>biocentric frame of reference we<br>actually have two interfaces and you can<br>actually see this is the guide from<br>spots and you can see he's looking at<br>you in the first person he provides a<br>chance to assess your mood decide<br>whether or not to do sparks and gives<br>you alternatives if you decide you don't<br>want to if you decide you do you then<br>choose an avatar and the game becomes a<br>third-person format and you go to a<br>fantasy world that is infested with nets<br>gloomy negative automatic thoughts and<br>as the Avatar you are to save the world<br>from nets and you travel from province<br>to province there are seven provinces<br>and all and each is loosely linked to a<br>cognitive behavioral therapy construct<br>and I'll give you a little idea of what<br>this looks like you fight Nets along the<br>way these are the net here and you can<br>transform them to snaps to sparks which<br>stands for smart positive active<br>realistic expect two thoughts<br>and this is a this is a little clip from<br>the swamp province and here the avatar<br>has to identify the net so that he can<br>hero you've made mistakes make mistakes<br>give up now it's a disaster you won't be<br>able to undo the terrible damage you've<br>your achievements outweigh any mistakes<br>keep progressing on your quest step ups<br>at the end of the world and here to go<br>through and keeps getting nets coming at<br>him and he has to transform them all and<br>then once he's done it you can actually<br>see the the road that's building up<br>through the swamp eventually the road<br>builds up and he goes along the road to<br>his next quest Carolina stayed with me<br>she's very game and helped me run a big<br>randomized control trial testing the<br>effectiveness of sparks multicenter<br>trial and Terry Matisse and match who<br>had all done their masters with me did<br>their PhDs on different projects with<br>this yet looking at sparks with<br>alternative education young people's<br>sexual minority young people and Maori<br>youth and these four people really did a<br>huge amount in terms of scripting sparks<br>brainstorming ideas running focus groups<br>with young people we had input from Rory<br>and a Maori advisory group we had a<br>Pacific and an Asian advisory group we<br>had a huge amount of input from software<br>developers and so on these sorts of<br>things aren't done alone we showed that<br>sparks was as effective as treatment as<br>usual which was usually four to five<br>face-to-face therapy sessions and we<br>were able to publish our results in the<br>British Medical Journal and they liked<br>us so much they even put us on the cover<br>up here we weren't however prepared for<br>the enormous international recognition<br>that we actually got for this work it<br>was that came as a bit of a surprise we<br>were given awards from under the<br>auspices of the United Nations and<br>UNESCO and we were featured on the radio<br>all over the world we've actually now<br>got groups working with us in research<br>right across the world sparks is now in<br>Dutch and it's in Japanese and we have<br>research applications in Denmark Canada<br>the United States the UK most recently<br>and through the one in Denmark so<br>but smart was developed on CD ROMs and<br>technology doesn't stand still so we<br>soon realized that we actually had to<br>put it onto the web from the cd-rom so<br>Carolina and I got another HR sea grant<br>and we looked at putting it onto the web<br>which is more complicated then I would<br>ever have dreamed we developed a web<br>interface a database in an e monitoring<br>tool in combination with kapiti youths<br>if it's down by wellington and we were<br>able to show that we could deliver it<br>online and this then lead us to be able<br>to get funding from the Prime Minister's<br>youth Mental Health Project for a<br>national launched by the Prime Minister<br>the and I'd like to acknowledge the<br>National Institute for Health innovation<br>and particularly Karen Carter and the<br>team over there who are actually<br>responsible for the roller we are now in<br>the match mornin advisory role and that<br>was all negotiated by uni services<br>sparks is now available freely online in<br>New Zealand for anybody who would like<br>to use it and as we actually roll it out<br>the next set of Christians is rolling in<br>and we're seeking to look to answer<br>those I'd like to leave depression now<br>and actually talk about tackling child<br>abuse and the aftermath of this and tell<br>you a little bit about the infant mental<br>health project that I've been involved<br>with with the counties with counties<br>menak oh I've been working with Joe<br>chiplun mayor and counties manukau were<br>very keen knew about the data about the<br>importance of the early development and<br>wanted to see whether or not we could<br>support infant mental health which is<br>healthy social and emotional development<br>for nought 23 year olds and they<br>commissioned me to do a literature<br>review and run a stocktake of their<br>current services in counties manukau and<br>that then led to the development of a<br>potentially preventive program which is<br>an interactive IDEO that actually shows<br>the quality of early social interaction<br>with children and these are handed out<br>free to all new mothers in counties<br>manukau now but it also led to the<br>development of the 02 / hora in<br>mental health service and the team from<br>foco tuberville or are actually here<br>tonight I was very pleased to be<br>involved in the design and<br>implementation of this it was really<br>great to see the need being found and<br>then for us to go from a sort of notion<br>to an actual service this is the actual<br>entrance there we have play rooms we did<br>a lot of work with using videos to help<br>monitor and reflect to parents how they<br>can interact and how they can improve<br>their interaction with the children this<br>is the lovely team and who are there am<br>I very sadly I gave up my clinical work<br>with them earlier this year we're also<br>bringing together research and clinical<br>practice so Tania cargo who's the<br>clinical psychologist there and who also<br>works in the department is doing her PhD<br>looking at parent-child interaction<br>therapy for far no it's also my pleasure<br>to be supervising the PhD thesis for<br>Linda hottie who is from autumn irony<br>trust an NGO in the counties manukau<br>area and Lynn has been running hawk<br>ekiti retail in a community setting and<br>this is a weekly parenting program that<br>runs for 14 weeks and she's getting<br>great results she's run it with her<br>mother with mothers and she's now<br>running it with fathers many of whom are<br>gang members and some of the feedback<br>from these men is actually amazing linds<br>are going to be submitting her thesis so<br>shortly and we excitedly thinking about<br>her postdoctoral work also thought about<br>improving care generally and Child and<br>Adolescent Mental Health and we're doing<br>a study within jointly with Harvard to<br>look at whether a modular approach to<br>delivering evidence based therapy might<br>improve care in the Child and Adolescent<br>Mental Health Services this is a large<br>national multi-site study and we hope to<br>be finished data collection by March and<br>we've got a number of the people from<br>the study there and the weary work force<br>team last but not least there's a very<br>big team this is this is the team about<br>18 months ago we've had a bit of change<br>there and these are all the people who<br>didn't make that initial photo so it's a<br>very big team<br>and they do a huge amount of work i<br>can't possibly talk about it all that<br>would take more than an hour but just to<br>give you a bit of an idea this is<br>Bronwyn and tinier two of our senior<br>advisors with a whole pile of resources<br>that they'd actually taken to one of the<br>conference's but little snippet we do<br>online training we host the Child and<br>Adolescent Mental Health postgraduate<br>training and we roll out evidence-based<br>therapies like incredible years which is<br>a positive parenting program and we have<br>created Maori resources and we're<br>developing Maori capability for for that<br>and many many many more projects looking<br>to the future and what might we do next<br>well are the research team is agrees<br>with Professor Tom Insel the director of<br>the national institute of mental health<br>behavioral intervention technologies are<br>potentially a game-changer especially<br>for the delivery of psychotherapy we'd<br>like to take the learnings that we've<br>actually had from sparks and the rather<br>salutary learnings that we've had from<br>mimo and think about where we might go<br>next and we've been involved with the<br>National Science challenge a 280 poo<br>area which is a better start and our<br>contribution in this is over nine years<br>we're hoping to be able to promote<br>mental health by providing habits which<br>is an online multi modular technology<br>intervention for adolescents to address<br>all the common mental health problems we<br>haven't got funding yet for one that<br>helps support parents with their skills<br>but we're working on it and I'd like to<br>finish with some thank yous Alan has<br>been with me since Medical School we've<br>known each other since we were at school<br>and he's been a wonderful support for me<br>over the years and quite a harsh critic<br>of my writing and my presentations<br>very honest feedback I always get but<br>but absolutely supportive from running<br>the running the home and I was doing my<br>exams and and cheering me on and so on<br>and it's um being wonderful to actually<br>share all of this my fantastic family we<br>have you through the small family this<br>is our big group with the various<br>offspring of both me and Zama and the<br>people who weren't sitting around the<br>table we've already added in at the<br>bottom we're beginning to develop the<br>next generation and we hope that they<br>will go forth and multiply so very big<br>thank you to them a very big thank you<br>to all my lovely friends as well you've<br>made such a difference to me on at<br>various times as well as sort of helping<br>pick up the pieces when I've needed<br>extra childcare and most recently<br>providing a providing a place to stay<br>when we pulled the kitchen out in our<br>house was demolished when i click couch<br>surfed shamelessly from one group to<br>another i'd also like to thank the<br>people who have funded us we've had a<br>lot of support from Health Research<br>Council downtown Auckland rotary club<br>had supported Carolina's half of<br>Carolinas salary for many years we've<br>had funding from the university of<br>auckland from the Ministry of Health<br>we've had big input from mitty<br>interactive and salt interactive who are<br>the software companies that we've worked<br>with and I think although we pay them<br>for their work I think they've given<br>more than we've paid them for and and<br>cure kids who have actually funded the<br>position that I've actually got I just<br>like to mention in terms of rosary and<br>Graham Henry and Peter crellin who've<br>been to particular supporters Graham is<br>overseas at the moment Reserve wasn't<br>able to come and Peter crellin who has<br>been around for so many for so many<br>years actually passed away a couple of<br>weeks ago and he's very sadly missed i'm<br>sure by his family and by the rotary<br>club but very sadly missed by our<br>research team too and so i just wanted<br>to mention him and finally rod and<br>patricia duke who are off actually<br>playing golf overseas so that's why<br>they're not here and we'll have to have<br>them for another and celebration another<br>time Vicky Lee who was CEO of cure kids<br>at during the time of raising the money<br>and they have done some wonderful things<br>Roy Austin who's chair of board delwyn<br>who's currently the acting CEO but has<br>done a lot of the work on the ground and<br>Tim Edmonds also but also the whole<br>q-kidz team they're a wonderful group<br>very big thank you from me of course I<br>have benefited enormously from having<br>this wonderful opportunity to hold this<br>position but I think creating this chair<br>is a wonderful gift for young people and<br>will allow I hope future people to<br>continue to take up the cudgels on the<br>path of the children of New Zealand and<br>I'm hoping that we can lend up with<br>children who all enjoy life as much as<br>the slot thank you very much everyone<br>for those of you who don't know me I'm<br>Rob kid I'm was as said he pointed out<br>head of department for much of the time<br>that she was much of the earlier but of<br>her career and I guess that I should<br>point out that anyone that knows Sally<br>Leah and Louise would realize when it<br>came to actually agree nor not agreeing<br>or not as to whether they could share a<br>point five appointment I didn't really<br>have much choice in and I think that<br>it's it's obvious from from Sally's talk<br>that Zimbabwe's lost has been our gain I<br>think that we are extremely lucky that<br>Sally and Ellen both decided amongst all<br>the countries in the world to have<br>chosen to settle in New Zealand I looked<br>up before I came here though what with<br>academics is part of what you do after<br>they've been in the position for two or<br>three years they get what's called a<br>continuation with you which is where as<br>head of department you have to write<br>down what how you think the person is<br>going what you think that they might<br>finish up as contributing<br>I think that what I said Sally at that<br>stage I think had been doing largely<br>clinical work and largely the teaching<br>that she was talking about and she just<br>got a couple of papers out but I thought<br>were quite good and I said that I've got<br>this expectation that I think she will<br>have a fine academic career so it's very<br>great and very pleasing to see this come<br>to fruition tonight celly thank you for<br>the lecture I think it was wonderful and<br>I think that what came through was a<br>number of things firstly as your as your<br>intelligence in terms of the way in<br>which you you approach problems and<br>think about them and having read your<br>writing despite anything Ellen says I<br>think you're also right very well I<br>think the other thing is your leadership<br>the way in which you have actually<br>brought groups together and actually<br>managed to to meld together these large<br>groups of people and then leading a<br>research team leading and developing the<br>weary center and also now being head of<br>department how you manage all of those<br>is outstanding I think the other two<br>things that actually come through that<br>are important or firstly as your great<br>commitment to treaty issues and what you<br>feel and what you give to Maori people<br>and your commitment to the sort of by<br>cultural development of new zealand and<br>the other thing I think is your passion<br>your passion for children and your<br>passion to make a difference to the<br>lives of younger people in New Zealand<br>and to make it better for them to be<br>able to grow and to better adults and so<br>that as you've said in the title of your<br>lecture which was very aptly chosen I<br>think that indeed I think your career<br>and what you've done in what you'll do<br>in the future really suggests to us that<br>young<br>mine's do in fact matter most so ladies<br>and gentlemen had asked you just
