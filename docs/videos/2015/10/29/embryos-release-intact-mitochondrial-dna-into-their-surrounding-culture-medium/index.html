accurate.</p><p>hi everyone my name's Elizabeth chemin<br>I'm a third year PhD student in the<br>department of obstetrics and gynecology<br>so my PhD project is looking at embryo<br>biomarkers so the reason why we want to<br>look at this is to try and improve our<br>IVF success rates I've year for in vitro<br>fertilization was developed as a<br>treatment for infertility and there's<br>maybe surprising but actually one in six<br>couples will experience infertility<br>what's more this is a rising trend as<br>women delay childbearing to pursue the<br>education in Korea and we know that a<br>woman's fertility Falls as she ages so<br>that by the time she's in her mid to<br>late 30s her eggs are less able to make<br>a baby in vitro fertilization or IVF was<br>developed as a treatment for infertility<br>and this little baby girl here this is<br>Louise Brown and she is the world's<br>first ivf baby born in 1978 so since<br>this time there have been over five<br>million children born through the use of<br>IVF technologies and this number<br>continues to rise especially in the<br>context of delay childbearing so what<br>happens in IV r for in vitro<br>fertilization is a woman is given drugs<br>or hormones to promote her body to<br>produce eggs these eggs are then<br>surgically collected and fertilized<br>outside of the body with the partners<br>sperm the resulting embryos then develop<br>in a lab and usually there are multiple<br>embryos developing at the same time<br>these embryos are checked on once a day<br>to see whether they look normal not all<br>of them will make it but by day five of<br>development just one of the embryos will<br>be chosen to put back into the uterus<br>and the remaining embryos will be frozen<br>for future use so how do we choose the<br>embryo to transfer into the uterus so<br>when we look down at the microscope at<br>these embryos once a day what are we<br>looking for so we know that the way in<br>embryo looks is important and when we<br>check these embryos once a day we look<br>for whether they<br>have a specific number of cells on<br>certain days and we look to see whether<br>they're reaching their developmental<br>milestones the problem is that not all<br>good looking embryos like this embryo<br>here actually go on to make a baby and<br>what this means is that more often than<br>not we actually choose the best looking<br>embryo to put back into the uterus but<br>this embryo that we choose actually<br>never has the potential to go on and<br>form a baby and this means that our IVF<br>success rates are still relatively low<br>with only eighteen percent of our IVF<br>cycles actually resulting in a live<br>birth or a baby what this means is we<br>actually need better methods of choosing<br>the embryos for transfer into the uterus<br>and this will essentially give patients<br>their best chance of having a baby so in<br>this patient example these two embryos<br>here or these two gray blobs are from<br>the same patient so one of the embryos<br>was chosen to put back into the uterus<br>first and this embryo sadly did not<br>result in a pregnancy causing a lot of<br>grief and distress to the couple the<br>other embryo on the other hand was<br>chosen second and this embryo did result<br>in a healthy pregnancy and a healthy<br>baby when you actually look at these two<br>embryos they pretty much look the same<br>and this means that there is something<br>else going on that determines which<br>embryo will make a baby and this is<br>something else that we can't see and<br>this is what my project is about we aim<br>to find improved ways of selecting the<br>embryo for transfer into the uterus and<br>we're in search of any other clues that<br>may tell us which embryo will make a<br>baby and clues more so than just looking<br>at the embryo once a day so in my PhD<br>project we have looked at this in three<br>different ways or looked at three<br>different biomarkers of embryo health<br>firstly we have filmed the embryos as<br>they develop and with these videos where<br>to get a lot more information about<br>these embryos compared to just looking<br>at them once a day with this information<br>we can calculate things like the timing<br>of cell division secondly we can look at<br>the cells that surround the egg before<br>fertilization the health of these cells<br>may translate into the health of the egg<br>and in the health of the embryo thirdly<br>we can look at the little media droplet<br>or the media bubble that the embryo<br>lives in winner is developing in the lab<br>and we think that SD embryo develops it<br>may be releasing information into its<br>surrounding environment or into this<br>media droplet so firstly we wanted to<br>see whether we could use a system called<br>time-lapse photography to tell it to<br>give us more information about which<br>embryo will make a baby so we put a<br>cohort of human embryos in these<br>time-lapse incubators that took pictures<br>of the embryos as they developed every<br>five minutes so already we're getting a<br>lot more information about our embryo<br>development compared to just looking at<br>the embryos once a day or once every 24<br>hours so these images here our example<br>pictures of what we get from this<br>time-lapse photography and you can see<br>detailed images of embryo development<br>and with this information we can<br>calculate timing of cell division so the<br>time it takes the embryo to reach the to<br>sale stage or the for sale stage or the<br>eight-cell stage what we found from this<br>work was that our healthy embryos tended<br>to show a strict developmental timeline<br>and when we saw variation or deviation<br>from the strict timeline it tended to<br>mean that our embryos were unhealthy<br>what we concluded from this work was<br>that our time-lapse photography may<br>actually be clinically useful for the D<br>selection of embryos for transfer into<br>the uterus so if we saw with this<br>increased monitoring and embryo<br>undergoing abnormal development then we<br>may choose to deselect the embryo for<br>transfer into the uterus<br>next we wanted to see whether we could<br>get information from the cells that<br>surround the egg before fertilization so<br>these cells are called cumulus cells and<br>they have a really important role in<br>protecting and nurturing the egg as it<br>develops and we wanted to see whether<br>the health of these cumulus cells<br>translated into the health of the egg<br>and in the health of the resulting<br>embryo specifically we were interested<br>in what kind of messages these cells<br>could give us and we analyzed myth<br>messages relating to sell health cell<br>development and cell growth what we<br>found was that there were in fact<br>correlations between the messages that<br>we saw in cumulus cells and in the<br>future development or health of the<br>embryo however when we try to build a<br>model that combined all of the<br>information from the different cumulus<br>al messages we couldn't find any<br>powerful predictors of embryo health<br>meaning that looking at these cells<br>alone may not be able to tell us which<br>embryos or may not be able to give us<br>enough information to tell us which<br>embryo will make a baby next we went in<br>search to see if we could find any clues<br>from the embryo media droplet so this<br>media droplet is what the embryo lives<br>in when it is developing in the lab and<br>we wondered as the abrir develops could<br>it be releasing information into its<br>surrounding environment and specifically<br>we wanted to search for genetic<br>information or DNA what we found was<br>that there was in fact DNA being<br>released by the embryo into this media<br>droplet and currently we do not know the<br>origins of this DNA or why the embryo<br>would be releasing this into its<br>surroundings as it develops however we<br>are hopeful that it may be able to tell<br>us about the health of the embryo and<br>work is currently underway to<br>investigate this possibility in<br>conclusion we know that looks alone<br>cannot tell us which embryo will make a<br>baby and what this means is that we're<br>often in the situation where we choose<br>an embryo based on looks to put back<br>into the uterus but the embryo that we<br>choose<br>never has the potential to go on and<br>form a baby in our study we have looked<br>at different biomarkers of embryo health<br>namely time-lapse microscopy cumulus<br>cells that surround the egg and the<br>media droplet that the embryo lives in<br>in our study we found that correlations<br>do exist between these biomarkers and<br>embryo health and our future work will<br>focus on understanding these to work out<br>whether they could give us more<br>information to tell us which embryo will<br>make a baby and most importantly better<br>markers of embryo health will improve<br>our IVF success rates giving infertile<br>couples their absolute best chance of<br>having a baby and having a family I<br>would like to thank my supervisors<br>Lindsey Cree and professor Andrew<br>shelling I'd also like to thank members<br>of the Cree and shelling lab fertility<br>associate and also the Auckland Medical<br>Research Foundation thank you very much<br>any questions I'm curious as to what<br>happens to those droplets absolutely<br>embryos releasing a DNA does the<br>droplets come go away at some stage or<br>that part do they end up being part of<br>the baby yes sir and that that's a<br>really good question so the media<br>droplets we're talking about you can<br>kind of think of it as the embryo is<br>kind of in a swimming pool it's quite a<br>big droplet that we create for the<br>embryo to live in while it's in the lab<br>with us and what the embryo actually<br>does right before we transfer it into<br>the uterus as it does actually have this<br>phase of growth and expansion and what<br>happens is is the inside of the embryo<br>actually forms this liquid cavity so<br>that liquid cavity on well that droplet<br>of liquid is part of the embryo and part<br>of the baby but what we are studying is<br>the external environment that the embryo<br>lives on winner is in the lab so you<br>could just a job yes so it's it's so are<br>droplets it's filled with nutrients that<br>the embryo lives own wallet is in the<br>lab and normally when the embryo gets<br>transferred into the uterus we would<br>normally discard that media because we<br>don't need it anymore and but this work<br>could potentially mean that we could get<br>some kind of useful information from<br>that media droplet so you refer to<br>eighty percent<br>fairly low it's a lot of success rate<br>likes boys noize Dewey's idea is because<br>they have trouble so I'm guessing like<br>there are others with the mothers others<br>maybe there's jeddaks question or<br>concern at the additional information<br>available in the media if you considered<br>actually testing whether there's coffee<br>jeans OMG yes so that that's a really<br>good point that you raise so we know<br>that a lot of a lot of the reason why<br>these embryos actually have such a low<br>success rate and actually forming a baby<br>is because they've got underlying<br>genetic abnormalities I mean this<br>genetic abnormality is what actually<br>underlies the decline in fertility as<br>the female ages so this becomes more and<br>more pronounced as the female ages so in<br>terms of whether we could test this<br>genetic information that's exactly what<br>we would want to do so we would try and<br>test whether that embryo actually has<br>the normal genetics that we expect the<br>normal genetics that's compatible with<br>life and therefore can go on and form a<br>baby so that's the idea behind trying to<br>seek this genetic information with which<br>to Chan to test and try find meaningful<br>one of the slides you mentioned that for<br>the time elapsed experiment your healthy<br>embryos stick stripper to the time of<br>cell division and but how do you<br>classify the embryos being healthy do<br>you put it back into the viewers of the<br>mother yeah yeah and that's a really<br>great question so with the developmental<br>timeline we were actually really<br>surprised because the embryos develop on<br>such a strict timeline suggesting that<br>this is obviously really inbuilt to the<br>program of the embryo and the divisions<br>that you see undergoing a strict<br>timeline are compatible with life in<br>terms of in the literature how this has<br>been tested so the gold standard of<br>testing this is relating the embryo<br>health to pregnancy and in live births<br>or whether the embryo forms a baby and<br>our study it was a pilot study so we<br>looked at the health of the embryo right<br>before it became transferred into the<br>uterus so as I said before this is when<br>the embryo starts to expand out and form<br>a cavity so we were testing these early<br>timings to see whether they were<br>actually predictive of later embryo<br>development and this is actually<br>clinically relevant because you actually<br>want to transfer the embryo into the<br>uterus as soon as you can back to its<br>natural environment and also in some<br>patients you might do the transfer of<br>the embryo much earlier so you'd only<br>have a snapshot of its development and<br>you'd want to try and predict what's<br>going to happen to that embryo later on<br>so that was the whole idea you mentioned<br>sending embryos transplanted into a into<br>a patient and the baby and a successor<br>for that second embryo being frozen and<br>if so is freezing embryos does that be<br>great in here oh yeah and that's a<br>really great question so this that<br>example of that patient I use that<br>example because both those embryos had<br>been frozen most what happens most of<br>the time is that your best embryo will<br>get transferred and what we call it will<br>be fresh so it won't be frozen and then<br>subsequent embryos become frozen the<br>freezing technology that we have<br>nowadays it's called quick freezing we<br>call it vitrification so it's actually a<br>very good technology nowadays and pretty<br>much ninety-nine percent of our embryos<br>survived this freezing process which i<br>think is pretty amazing and in terms of<br>the success rates they're pretty similar<br>between whether the embryo has been<br>frozen or not been frozen so it's more<br>of a tool for us to transfer one embryo<br>at a time and save the rest for<br>subsequent cycles and subsequent</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
