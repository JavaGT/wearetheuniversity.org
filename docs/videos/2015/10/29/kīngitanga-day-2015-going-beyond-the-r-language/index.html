TV and a coat o couture<br>Oh rusty bucket in a hotel or tomorrow<br>or ruler mahalo to our call naughty<br>colony key one rapper 2 eb core ottawa<br>Dragonoid to help you for pop why to<br>Cuddington pune nor ever i cannot go to<br>captain so I've just acknowledged by<br>Maori connection to the south part of<br>the North Island what newzealand that of<br>course is not the whole story so let me<br>acknowledge my hockey high side as well<br>so I had a connection to the Malaysians<br>on my mother's side who remember<br>founding fathers of Dunedin and on my<br>father's side how the EP was disabled<br>for the bankers who were early citizens<br>of masterton so the little trepidation<br>that I've come to talk with other people<br>who actually know something about but I<br>will do my best let's say I am a<br>statistician it's been two weeks since<br>my last data analysis and I am actually<br>a statistician what I do in to play<br>around with computers rather a lot and<br>that isn't actually any surprise because<br>statisticians are really very early<br>adopters of computer technology even<br>before there were out toilet computers<br>statisticians we<br>punch cards and chemical sorting<br>machines through census tech relation<br>that sort of thing and when electronic<br>computers came along with statuses left<br>on those because they enabled us to<br>actually do some calculations as whereas<br>before we actually haven't been able to<br>do that and this talk is a joint talk<br>with Brendan economies a PhD student of<br>mine who this actually do some work on a<br>new language that we are beginning to<br>think about and I'll have a little bit<br>more to say about that I did actually<br>want to bring bring it along so he took<br>your part of the court but unfortunately<br>he doesn't do a daytime we schedule our<br>meetings at 5pm in that which is the<br>earliest he can possibly make it make it<br>an aunt who's often late for that and so<br>there wasn't much reviews and here's<br>what i wrote down as an outline of the<br>suitable i have to say i just read some<br>stuff on slides on how to plan and they<br>you follow that extinct arise<br>necessarily probably anyway i want to<br>talk a little bit about exactly what is<br>statistical software and what makes it<br>different from other kinds of software<br>then i want to talk a little bit about<br>history by history i mean going back to<br>the 60s which is about as far back as i<br>go there i want to talk a little bit<br>about the development of our i know i've<br>been here before and another thing we<br>come today and talk about us i guess<br>i'll be kind one of the usual suspects<br>for these talks so that that'll be<br>fairly sure and then more particularly<br>about why our life are as kind of taken<br>off in the past five years or so it's<br>all kinds of tension and I've been<br>thinking for ten years were all over<br>rubbish we've got the end<br>so I'll tell you why I think it's really<br>not that wonderful and then talk about<br>the investigation I'll try to go further<br>and maybe in slightly different<br>directions I've just noticed my list of<br>bullet points you have an actual<br>correspond to the slides it's right like<br>that okay so what in statistical<br>software and now Eternals its software<br>designed specifically to carry out<br>statistical analyses out where has that<br>make it different from any other<br>software that's used to carry out any<br>the major thing about statistical<br>software is that it's collection orient<br>so you never really talk about a single<br>dating it's always a collection of data<br>around and we tend to handle these<br>things as aggregates and worthless<br>aggregates to all other software that's<br>developed ignore the idea of scalar<br>variables and that something has come<br>back to bite us it's also very strong in<br>its American capability and so languages<br>that aren't very good with numerical<br>things are totally useful in statistics<br>because it's very very intensive the<br>other thing is there needs to be at<br>least some symbolic capability there<br>because when we're doing statistics you<br>are looking at models and morals are<br>typically some sort of mathematical<br>statement not a computational state so<br>you need to be able to specify models in<br>some symbolic form and work with them<br>has slip you later soic still and of<br>course if you're actually gonna gets<br>work done you have to have a whole bunch<br>of state statistical methodology<br>included within the software okay well<br>you know you can do statistical now<br>most systems but another characteristic<br>it's really important is that the<br>software should intrude on the analysis<br>because when you're sitting there doing<br>the analysis with concentrating on the<br>data you're thinking about the models<br>the last thing you want to have to think<br>about is how do I compete this what do I<br>need to do in order to get my potential<br>done you just want it to happen and you<br>want to see the place and there's like<br>that so so our motto would be it's<br>important to think that statistics not<br>about competing okay so let's start off<br>with a little bit of history and these<br>are some of the software systems that<br>developed early on and by early on at me<br>in early over 60s I was a kid running<br>around barefoot in right at home so I<br>don't actually see a grip universe until<br>later but if you look at these most of<br>these statistical systems came out of<br>universities or sometimes research<br>institutes to the bmv immediately p<br>series came out in CLA health sciences<br>there on the tab came out of the<br>National Institute of Standards<br>connection is developed by physicists<br>not by statisticians sassier North<br>Carolina State University p step out of<br>the education of piston service<br>Princeton University and seven later<br>that's why the space they gents that<br>hanging out of roughly state of<br>Agriculture Research Station will take<br>all of these i believe were actually<br>developed by statisticians this real<br>computing positions behind these cables<br>but these are what people would all of<br>these would have gone through the tulip<br>scenes for IBM 360 373 like that later<br>on<br>control the regular-shoes are we choose<br>like that none of these were interactive<br>which sounds like Australia's thing to<br>say in these days but it was a time when<br>we used to go to computer center punch<br>things on cards and run the cards to a<br>card from that and then wait several<br>hours to bed results back now that<br>really starts to limit what the other<br>doing statistics because statistics is<br>really an interactive conversation try<br>various things the response to work see<br>you then modify what we're doin somethin<br>so it's very much a tight circle so<br>these kinds of systems really packaged<br>up a lot of switches to a methodology<br>and people would certainly a problem<br>into the closest approximation of<br>methodology with this valuable<br>assistance in the 1970s and 80s late<br>seventies as far as I was concerned much<br>more interactive computing start<br>becoming label things like PDP oh<br>heavens were actually affordable and<br>individual departments forget though and<br>if you will repair to stay up late at<br>night to get the solar use of these<br>things and so you could really start the<br>first interactive system irony in that<br>encounter was called learning which came<br>out of the royal statistical society<br>again we're talking about official test<br>developers p.m. and i play that with<br>when microcomputers came along then<br>and i was tired of lucky because i was<br>in berkeley at about the time that<br>viously look she's getting on the way ok<br>so there were a lot of BB levels around<br>the mathematics and statistics<br>departments there and actually one of<br>the earliest blues machines around<br>because Kim Thompson had been set up the<br>16 excision nobody really knew had<br>around there was a sort of manual into<br>something wrong it would be pre calc<br>manual page to direct plates and<br>following instructions there without<br>understanding what was going on and this<br>would sometimes do it again I'm Florida<br>building i was in surviving officer my<br>office there was this guy called enjoy<br>Who the master student one of the<br>families of sudden Microsystems and he<br>was the only master student it would<br>seem we had a secretary a million-dollar<br>because these machines became available<br>it was possible for students most<br>particularly students but also faculty<br>to start playing with these things can<br>we build interactive one of those<br>disease was called is P which is<br>interactive statistics package ideas<br>which was written by the graduates of<br>Princeton and it was never pushed off to<br>Berkeley and how the temperature as well<br>system for that which kind of evolved<br>from isp but more interestingly a system<br>called s was being developed at Bell<br>Labs the the big sort of Martha Tom<br>metab devolved minitab and it was<br>commercialized and it's still around<br>these days but really this was the one<br>that was kind of interesting because it<br>was developed by some of it's been a<br>long time thinking about competing again<br>a statistician who started out with<br>erica griffin time series so if all<br>systems that we really had to play with<br>this was about the most interesting and<br>part of the reason what was interesting<br>was because<br>hi mate tea and AT&amp;T who not only on the<br>phone system and they weren't allowed to<br>do it repetitively computer so they used<br>to develop a lot of computing products<br>and they will just give them out there<br>you could get in touch with them and<br>they would seem the source business as a<br>result of the sort of free circulation<br>of the software it became a bit of a<br>standard in the academic world and that<br>may be overstating that there were at<br>least half of the university is the food<br>but they were Berkeley Stanford<br>University with Washington in Seattle so<br>some quite important places picked it up<br>and it was a sort of a de facto standard<br>in the academic world ultimately AT&amp;T<br>was broken up and they'll each other<br>that we're going to make killing use<br>computers and so then the pressure came<br>on them to actually commercialize the<br>things that they previously way and in<br>the late 80s the S system commercialized<br>and we can no longer get source code and<br>that made it unlock less interesting<br>expensive as well so towards the end of<br>the 80s we lost access to this now<br>before we leave the seventies and<br>eighties I want to talk about hardware<br>constraints because it had a big effect<br>on the kind of software that we produced<br>most of the interactive systems that I<br>played with initially we developed on<br>include Elevens there were 16 that<br>machines and that men can have a<br>certainty pay address space so think<br>about that these days we talking to you<br>guys<br>well suffice processors but with 32k and<br>you can get 64 separate living<br>instructions in the data spaces you<br>actually had to be creative about the<br>program and in order to get that and a<br>typical model for this sort of thing was<br>we have a shell program that maintaining<br>the conversation with person who is<br>using it and it would fall off<br>supplementary programs to carry out<br>particular statistical analysis and<br>these analyses because they were<br>restricted to their behavior could<br>actually read on your typical data sets<br>that they were very smaller than some<br>prospector to do something but typically<br>they would copy bits of the data we<br>would analyze them to pc so throughout<br>all of the slow data sets resided on<br>disputed never actually wholesaler to<br>only work and each was read at each<br>stage of the analysis into a program to<br>deliver and that I think got a central<br>way of thinking which is constrained<br>what's happened since then okay so in<br>small machines it's natural to hold the<br>data out there on the desk and the copy<br>into the memory as you and that means<br>you get into the habit of thinking in<br>terms of copying okay there are a number<br>of systems out there that do this is if<br>even play the SAS system your steps to<br>show you may have done that ceske<br>towards data out there and it's streams<br>through and users updating algorithm so<br>it's only 10 in one Henry one<br>observation all the versions of<br>aeschylus data and its functions out<br>there on disk and it also kept the<br>evaluation step as computation on you<br>produce intoxication out and step so in<br>written out the disk so<br>you get to thinking in terms of making<br>pockets and that's something that's kind<br>of stable semantics of statistical<br>systems okay so I'm going to talk about<br>our and I was kind of model so we should<br>maybe take a little bit about what it<br>looks like it's an imperative expression<br>most language so you type expressions<br>and press ENTER and the computation<br>happens and resorts are printed so it's<br>a really like sister it's inflated as a<br>tree making interpretive and so that<br>means it's slowly but it's also<br>extremely dynamic produces very<br>interesting things the data structures<br>are aggregate type structures so no<br>scales there are atomic vectors and<br>raised and what list really gr8 vectors<br>and everything is built up outwards it<br>wasn't that their lab so you can imagine<br>it's like one of those little languages<br>that would give them lads in the late<br>70s early 80s here's an example of the<br>syntax so this was really a singular<br>value decomposition of a matrix and<br>gather the results for that over here<br>we'll listen specters raise so this has<br>to be a list with the dollar operand it<br>provides access to named components that<br>list so this is calculating the creation<br>because it's come from this room we<br>immediately copy really time it has<br>passed by them semantics now that's an<br>illusion it's a copying all modified<br>certain Carson array into<br>function it's not actually counting my<br>lease which we verified the other thing<br>is that functions first class and they<br>can be passed relevant arguments and<br>the scoping is this is what sort of<br>interested me additionally because i was<br>telling someone i just found out about<br>closures and countries than they were<br>scheming i want to show them I didn't<br>have a scheming to illinois machinist in<br>yet i'll try to make this tribal closure<br>and it didn't work which was wrong<br>hasn't and that's because the scoping is<br>scoping rules say first look globally<br>for things sorry first ugly and then<br>look globally so there are no<br>intervening possibilities there are only<br>those two points this is defined to be<br>used interactively doing the director<br>statistical analyses so there are the<br>decorations variables are created by us<br>all things that we assigned to a ruin<br>site that creates other area so there<br>are no closures here you can't close<br>over the scope that you are related<br>learning at your local variables on the<br>plus side that makes it easy the serial<br>instructions so keep all your functions<br>at their own does don't have to worry<br>about shared state variables or anything<br>like that on the minus side this kind of<br>scoping is actually pretty confusing<br>because you try and do things with your<br>finger work and they don't and here's my<br>prototypical example are so here we are<br>defined function the doc doc doc I just<br>this is unimportant stuff so function<br>operation for us arguments there and<br>there are fingers in the body of these<br>functions so here we have an outer<br>function and listed within that there<br>are two functions f1 and f2 and this is<br>the sort of thing but what's different<br>either is that if two in the bottom<br>California quarter if you cannot see<br>good one because you can see what's<br>local either that we'll see what's<br>globally later and people got extremely<br>puzzled wireless kind of soda it also<br>leads to a style of programming that's<br>very trapped so you have lots<br>multi-functions acted in over the level<br>and you can't hide anyway so this was<br>kind of a motivation for having a look<br>at possible physical things and so I<br>guess it was very early nineties I can't<br>remember exactly nothing like you<br>belonged 92 we had some of the old one<br>who was visiting from Canada we bump<br>into each other in the corridor quite<br>literally and he said let's write some<br>software and so there wasn't a deep<br>question that we had environment it<br>would rather it was just let's do<br>something from them but to give it some<br>shape we host a couple of questions to<br>our first of all how easy is it to<br>actually write in systems with<br>my interest was in the scoping so if we<br>switch to you lexical scoping<br>see the variables of the stuff that you<br>are mr. rhythm what will change and we<br>will both concern about the fact that<br>the memory management system was<br>grateful it was kind spaced on Malik was<br>allocated is allocate things are big<br>things and attentive small the top they<br>will prompt and then your cavity so if<br>you were running a loop of something<br>iterative you just build and so the<br>advice that I'd seen on this newfangled<br>thing called in internet said if you're<br>going to write a language based system<br>you should start with this because don't<br>you're going to end up with some<br>half-assed location of this response we<br>actually added vs so that's when we<br>started and what we did was to steal a<br>little scale implementation from kalyan<br>and started beefing matt adams with a<br>delivery management for pc and we felt<br>after why would we actually have the<br>basis of something we could actually<br>lose now if you are so many teachers<br>they were initial reaction is I'm a<br>teacher I can't the sudden I should put<br>these two moves together so we should<br>think about teaching the class was<br>nobody interesting statistic students<br>but the chance that they're going to<br>squat lisps attacks is about so we<br>needed a syntax that we were going to<br>promise so the one that we had handy was<br>the one that we were both least using<br>because of the legal system available to<br>us and so we lifted the syntax pretty<br>much wholesale<br>yes now he had no containers with cars<br>with Oh longer headless local global<br>only souls of adapter for assignments<br>took place and Falconeri abilities but<br>the interesting thing was as soon as<br>we've changed the syntax we got into<br>this game of let's make it look as much<br>like ass as possible and in a way that<br>was being captured by something it was a<br>bit unfortunate my initial thought was<br>that's right to which we flew like<br>languages and try things out because of<br>an action we weren't actually able to do<br>as much experimentation is over but the<br>compatibility game was under play used<br>to write to john chambers and here's the<br>guy who developed this he actually won<br>the ACM systems aboard for physical<br>software systems award for his work<br>Ronnie's take his criminal name is just<br>full computer isolate and in 17 really<br>means heaven what we were smoking this<br>kind of clever fairly early but he was<br>always actually very polite and very<br>hopeful flute us into a lot they're<br>thinking behind what memories now after<br>we've got a certain amount of<br>competitive we notice that there was<br>actually a lot of circular out there<br>people to room and there's a place for<br>the staff I'm where people have been<br>deposited software for some time and in<br>particular there was a lot of software<br>probably its developers prepare its<br>updates per case and one is able to do<br>that that have to get wheeler sign off<br>now there wasn't really thought that<br>there was another engine of pretty used<br>to run that same software but we were<br>able to get that and give large amounts<br>of application software to run in our<br>system<br>the result of this was that we produce<br>something that was s right enough for<br>people to be able to run their software<br>and a lot of people started expressing<br>interest but they were nervous about the<br>fact that we might try and take their<br>liver and produce something commercial<br>version is over makings at the same time<br>the Free Software Foundation GPL license<br>was kind of in the air and that was<br>really be there for awhile is really<br>starting to take off become visible so<br>we decided for the GPL license on our<br>staff I'm just hanging out here to see<br>what would happen so this is kind of<br>istria card what the wrong so he started<br>they won't later than the early 1900's i<br>say i think this was 91 it was a little<br>bit I'm structured because Robert was<br>there i'll leave your place in Canada<br>but he so he decided to move back a year<br>later so those kinds of joeys so it's<br>the top problem exact date for instance<br>so we played around the business rules<br>and circulated by mr. people in 1996 we<br>decided we'd had enough for taking<br>pictures the people in seriously usually<br>we were trying to understand what they<br>were doing figuring out my work and so<br>we've got people who piss the best the<br>most and we gave the source code access<br>so that they can sort of go with code<br>access and people who do and from that<br>point on things really started to take<br>off initially they were I think six<br>people developing that soon rule about<br>in 1999 reaction managed to sew in 97 we<br>mentioned get everybody together for the<br>first time actually access partners in<br>their hotel in Vienna and people with<br>dicono through the door and will be<br>something this and can we know this<br>person should we say hello because we<br>knew each other by email but not<br>actually by the village so there was a<br>very good week in 97 really spent most<br>of the info bar because that's the<br>important thing of development it's not<br>about technical ideas that can be sorted<br>out by email it's about trust and beer<br>is trash particularly so instead a lot<br>of time in a building trust that week<br>and I think it was at that point<br>somebody suggested that we have a<br>version 1.0 we'd be the norm for the six<br>miles so there was a target the original<br>target thats it was 99 99 which we<br>didn't think he won he paints of<br>remember them the other one was a very<br>lying favorite 29 2000 which should have<br>existed but because of the millennium<br>and do exists district so that's<br>impacted on a date since that first<br>release the the exponential developer<br>base was growing exponentially and the<br>last time I looked at you little is<br>there were four thousand of contributing<br>packages so there's a website like see<br>can or sometime<br>we can just walk off contributions and<br>it may well be in excess of 5,000 out of<br>the problem here is that there's no<br>editorial process because it's<br>completely voluntary there's no control<br>over any of these software packages and<br>most of them are grateful so if you are<br>going to use are going to protect any of<br>these packages really be careful and try<br>them out and even tribal users because<br>they're absolutely no guarantees that<br>cover the only quality chick that's made<br>its programming pilots and that the<br>arguments and functions match the<br>description in there's nothing that says<br>okay so if we look at what we achieved<br>our and is both of you about right they<br>seem to provide about the right the<br>right makes of usability missiles so<br>they don't get in the way we do they<br>work interactively things are just<br>available you could use them you can do<br>simple things very easily you can find<br>new functions on the fly and other thing<br>as you want to even be a little more<br>developed social packages of software<br>the biggest problem is that it is really<br>really slow a lot of us country with<br>that that it's a a tree will be returned<br>that's fast more particularly<br>effectively using whole x value<br>semantics means<br>is an awful lot of copy we tend to be<br>conservative and so in a lot more to<br>tell you about the true horror on this I<br>don't know how many of you know about<br>linear regression but essentially set up<br>an equation that relates a y-value to<br>several x values as a linear combination<br>and as part of the process of actually<br>fitting that model you create a big<br>matrix and you expand any categorical<br>variables that sort of any motive types<br>into dummy variables that specify guess<br>it's this level no it's not so the Civil<br>set of variables that we start with can<br>expand up into something very large in<br>the process of actually fitting the<br>model in volatile at seven the<br>Copeland's of that matrix degrade and<br>these days I'm under your project at the<br>moment that has 65,000 observations and<br>at last count 326 variables so you can<br>imagine algorithms and accuracy start<br>here there's another like so these<br>things it fast and then you make<br>multiple copies of and that means you've<br>got a very big memory footprint now I<br>would have thought people would have<br>noticed that it found this they're<br>really slow but more walls more has been<br>going on at such a late that produces<br>can be noticed and think they've been<br>able to handle good the problems and<br>it's sufficiently high rate that they've<br>been happy to keep usable the other<br>constraint here is that we're working<br>entirely in terms of aggregates so<br>there's no idea that you could carry out<br>an official scalar computation other<br>than by coding it in a foreign language<br>like Fortran C and forward that in any<br>of an abstraction area that makes it<br>hard to actually develop a still is<br>interactively we've actually got 26<br>processes that have to go along because<br>you can't actually do things in a scale<br>away you tend to try to flip things into<br>an aggregate framework so we'll try and<br>do matrix computations rather than the<br>obvious scale-up publication then you're<br>doing things like expanding up memory<br>involved it was now you're in situation<br>we caught by making copies lots of<br>copies of this thing and there are some<br>languages that attempt to be round out<br>of them so I think about 10 years ago i<br>started thinking there's got to be<br>something various other people had been<br>making some attempt to do different<br>things and there's three things that are<br>listed here that people tried the first<br>of them is translation of our code to<br>c++ so you have some well-defined art<br>functions you can translate those into C<br>or C++ and then put those into power and<br>cool the problem here is the abstraction<br>barrier you invariably get bugs in the<br>program and now you're important<br>debugging the C++ which is linked to<br>this behemoth and it's a little tragic<br>events with another approach that we've<br>taken is quite compilation so Luke<br>Tony's been trying to write a bike<br>compiler for it in 12 years now the<br>semantics in are a very much hostile to<br>this and so all of those things well no<br>the other thing is traced compilation<br>people who had done to the trace<br>combination of JavaScript handle on it<br>to only know how to make this thing go<br>fast and it's<br>five years later and I'm still waiting<br>so I think it was harder than will fit<br>of the story so the other possibility is<br>to just stop with I and start to think<br>about given what we've learned from<br>doing our what can we do differently how<br>can we go about this and so that's kind<br>of where I'd actually like my PhD<br>student to come and start talking about<br>these theories but you'll have to put up<br>with me so this is an indirect version<br>of what he's been doing um I was<br>constrained very early on by our<br>decision to be compatible remember the<br>reasons for doing that with all our<br>software in access to that was actually<br>useful because it got us off the ground<br>pretty quickly so decision there was the<br>escalator ah so we could steal answer<br>but ask that wouldn't necessarily runnin<br>yes because we didn't care but this has<br>led us to efficiency problems and I've<br>mentioned the companies now now our<br>attitude is that our she get used as an<br>exemplar so it's the kind of thing we<br>like to have it's got the right feeling<br>to it but we don't really want to have<br>that label of compatibility if it's<br>going to constrain us if it doesn't<br>constrain us villains go to but if it<br>does I we're not going to not going to<br>pursue it because it's going to have a<br>bad papers now the bad side of that is<br>that all the application code will have<br>to be because it makes assumptions about<br>copy<br>that we can't actually guarantee my<br>thought about this is given the quality<br>of the list of Iraq home that's the mall<br>bad okay God when I would regard as an<br>existence theorem now we can go back and<br>actually be a lot more careful program<br>these things up pretty carefully and<br>it's not like this is just tail behavior<br>didn't know a Whooper good programming<br>of the statistics and so did the wrong<br>things all the water in code is based on<br>original model encoded by professor at<br>Stanford and it's just not that good the<br>programming is clumsy to put it mildly<br>and what's happened is that everybody<br>since Hebron initial phase has come<br>along the property so this is kind of<br>propagated throughout the whole system<br>very very clumsy ways of doing things so<br>it's going to be a lot of water but the<br>interesting thing is I think that a<br>project like I where people are<br>contributing to a free software project<br>suggest you can give a lot of code<br>written quickly and you can probably get<br>it written by people who are pretty good<br>at what they do so you know makes 18<br>years ago but a while ago I got this PhD<br>student who come through computer<br>science it was kind of interested in<br>statistics because his father is one of<br>my colleagues and he wanted to pursue<br>this so i tasked him with writing a new<br>language to do these kinds of things so<br>here are basically my instructor you<br>need to be careful not describe<br>and so you'll have to have a look at our<br>and you'll have to see what the pros are<br>and the primary good things are that the<br>environment is interactive and that's an<br>absolute necessity for doing any kind of<br>statistical analyses because it is this<br>development cycle of try something see<br>the results modify what you do try that<br>see the results or you're going around<br>in a circle the environments got to<br>doing data analysis is interactive<br>program you don't know what you voted<br>stock and you will often have to roll in<br>pieces of software only fly I've never<br>seen food so that we need the director<br>development and they won't speed okay<br>well our first thought was let's look<br>around for system that gives us this and<br>the obvious system out there was called<br>its interactive environment you can<br>develop code interactively and it's got<br>pretty good performance okay the kinds<br>of things it does okay so our initial<br>starting point was to take communist and<br>add statistical functionality use one of<br>the compilers of the compiler that we<br>sit along as spcl and yeah things went<br>along for a while but we found that<br>though some real issues particularly<br>around new areas because the arithmetic<br>in common list is very hard wired so if<br>you have new kinds of things and you<br>want to stop by the arithmetic for the<br>compiler isn't ready so the option we<br>had was to maybe start hacking this and<br>that didn't seem like a very smart idea<br>hey because we didn't know that much<br>about listen to compilers and if you<br>look at the sales curve<br>pcl it's kind of a mess way that open<br>source of free software is and so after<br>a bit afore we decided it would be<br>better to start from scratch and that's<br>kind of well with being for a few years<br>now in the process of thinking about<br>what we want to do we looked at various<br>models and these are in some sense<br>competitors in the space so MATLAB is an<br>obvious one it's a very successful<br>system commercial based is based on<br>manipulating matrices as the name<br>suggests the people who like MATLAB has<br>lately started about new language junior<br>which is a compiled language it's got<br>lots of features that are being added<br>and I thought for a while I was going to<br>go in that direction but the project<br>smells a little bit of funny so with a<br>lot of free software project the human<br>interaction thing is really good and the<br>sense i get from julia is that there are<br>people there are people at the heart of<br>it to really control people seem to come<br>into the print it for a while and then<br>just kind of drift off now some of the<br>original identicals have actually gone<br>over there there are some issues with it<br>because for example one of the things<br>that's key in statistical systems is the<br>ability to handle missing data and so<br>you need missing data indicators and<br>it's nice effect built-in really low<br>levels to do that over the top where<br>existing system doesn't actually work<br>that well and now that the prime<br>developments for Julia don't see it that<br>way they see themselves as<br>and that doesn't happen listen<br>conservation so it's still interesting<br>to watch the development of that and<br>members of interesting things it's kind<br>of C++ ish it's based on it we ll be in<br>compiler toolkit and that is pretty much<br>C++ or so you've got to fit into that<br>particular aliens more historically APL<br>provides some very interesting fitness<br>to look at in the way of handling arrays<br>and there are other persons of APL most<br>wonderful to me out which is listed<br>interactive arrays so it's got some<br>interesting things to say but it's been<br>around a long time and if it was maybe<br>the environment we wanted to use with<br>the user look scheme i think is also<br>kind of interesting but again it suffers<br>from the same problem that Common Lisp<br>is that it's not designed to do the<br>things that we wanted to do I'm Dylan I<br>it was also pretty interesting and I<br>thought for a long time that was going<br>to be a big language the time I started<br>thinking about these things that look<br>like there are two possibilities there<br>was this thing Dylan which was is coming<br>out apple and hip look like this<br>beautiful clean nice language and then<br>on the other hand is this nature of some<br>oak which look really reckoning nasty<br>then they renamed the Java to take off<br>which tells you about something that<br>even got what i know about computer<br>languages either it was picked the wrong<br>round and so we looked at some other<br>things as well one of the interesting<br>things we looked at was suicidal see<br>which takes a very high level<br>description of aggregate operations and<br>it tries to analyze down and rewrite the<br>code<br>a very efficient over the way and that<br>seems like something you really want to<br>be able to do so if you're a<br>statistician we want to give this very<br>high level description of water doesn't<br>want to do but you'd like that to happen<br>facility so that seems really like the<br>kind of thing would like the problem is<br>super solid see works really well for<br>things that it does really well but it<br>doesn't do everything you like so while<br>it's interesting it didn't seem to be<br>what we wanted to do so choices when<br>they are is it shouldn't feel different<br>from ours what is we want it to be<br>imperative so as I said these things are<br>often interactive you are defining the<br>way things are going to happen as you go<br>through you don't know what the whole<br>picture is yet you need to build it up<br>and parentally it's going to be compiled<br>because we learnt that sort of speed R&amp;S<br>have a needed idea using lazy evaluation<br>for function arguments and that has some<br>very strange events the reason for<br>actually getting them is so that you can<br>get access to the code we actually<br>interpreted code and treat the code<br>symbolically so what way of doing that<br>is to keep the posture ground as<br>probably expression evaluated and then<br>you can always get that symbolic for<br>that extra garden so we need to put it<br>quote evaluation for the function ogress<br>we decided that rather than using<br>anything else with a quote by riffat<br>semantics because that's what it really<br>does and we wanted to have scalar types<br>because we wanted to be able to<br>efficiently down the state labor so this<br>is the task i gave bring them toward his<br>PhD use to write language<br>both the source and so he been away and<br>he's started thinking about this i guess<br>i've talked about it I uses lazy<br>evaluation we just can't have that mean<br>to we need much more efficiency that we<br>can get from there you can get the<br>effective lazy evaluation with quotation<br>anyway so we don't actually read that<br>the other thing that our does is it<br>makes use of access to environments and<br>cold frames and so a function of<br>operating has a sort of dynamic scope<br>capability that will preserve its way<br>back up looking at variables of the<br>functions there and that gets made<br>useful a lot so we can't have that so we<br>losing some capability we're losing some<br>dynamism but hopefully we're going to<br>gain for decorations we know we need<br>decorations because we've got to help<br>the compiler out and tell the types of<br>these because they imagine that code<br>deals specific to that but we've taken<br>the idea that this should be optional so<br>if you are interactively analyzing the<br>data set you can't afford to have to sit<br>there and think what's the type of this<br>so it has demotion and if you leave out<br>the types you may pay a price elections<br>you just go through that if you're<br>prepared to go in there and do full<br>annotation of the total of the writing<br>then you can buy no stories that's a<br>useful sort of way to proceed it means<br>that the code will run in basic way but<br>you<br>help it out and make it run a lot faster<br>if you want so the typing is optional<br>and it's there is an assertion so what<br>happens is when you go into our code<br>which has type specified you can check<br>at the boundary what with a relati<br>constraint is satisfied a change from<br>our very the scope will need to declare<br>and that's not going to affect anyone<br>working interactively it is going to<br>in the tape line we've decided we have<br>to have scalars in our and other<br>languages scale as I represented by<br>vectors of length 1 okay so vectors are<br>a kind of container object and so that<br>means when you go to get a value you<br>first we'll have to find out where the<br>container is they have to open<br>entertaining at reaching take the value<br>out when you are putting a value back<br>there you have to look at the value put<br>it back inside the container so there's<br>a lot of other associated with so we<br>won't stay 0 times and at the primitive<br>level we also want the scalar types to<br>have missing values as part of the type<br>specification we can use I Tripoli's man<br>values the flooding for immediate<br>illogical character and numerator types<br>okay so what's a progress report well<br>this is brendan's PhD and I keep saying<br>today angelonia merger done yet he keeps<br>saying you know justjust all over the<br>world is doing with the register the<br>implementation is there we actually have<br>a to end implementation at this point<br>it's really details we use it as syntax<br>which is really close to our s or affect<br>many other languages as well the code is<br>put through a series of translations<br>into static single assignment form and<br>so there are a lot of optimizations<br>available literature hold on at that<br>point at the moment the back end is<br>about how to cover this pretty high<br>level operations but that is really just<br>for giving the thesis done the ultimate<br>goal here is to replace that the real<br>code generator of the back llvm is one<br>possibility but the way we're really<br>it's only in the most recent release<br>Lefevre GCC and so it'll probably take a<br>while to to chew at all sorts of things<br>we need to think about is garbage<br>collection the garbage collector in our<br>memory management in our is really<br>pretty good and it has to be because it<br>is stress tested like you really believe<br>so we will probably take some variant of<br>that<br>so plan is to actually complete a basic<br>language environment for the registers<br>the question is what do you do there a<br>language white self isn't actually<br>during useful you have to be able to do<br>things with it and so the question is<br>how do we start to grow a more complete<br>system around well my experience in<br>attempted ruthlessly some academic<br>environment is nobody's interested so<br>there's been no appetite to give funding<br>to our or anything like that the officer<br>is truly like interesting taking out of<br>our there's a tempest called revolution<br>analytics who through failing with<br>various liens decided they could<br>actually sell a version of art without<br>delivering all the source code to it<br>even though it's GPL and they were<br>recently bought by a company called<br>Microsoft and so Microsoft is with<br>advertising arm and taking money out of<br>it and there's been no for by either is<br>people that are putting money back into<br>this project so I think that one's kind<br>of off the cards my my experience of<br>programs here is it's just a complete<br>waste of time so it's not wrong with<br>that the other way to go is to try and<br>make use of go ahead without and avaya<br>things kind of rural organic and this is<br>kind of important because there's no<br>such thing as an expert in statistics<br>there are lots of experts in small parts<br>of statistics so the knowledge is really<br>dispersed and you can't have a single<br>person to come in and implement it in<br>fact we can't have a team of 20<br>however t100 because there's always much<br>more than done and in fact I heard a<br>quote from the commercial statistic<br>exactly developers saying how do you<br>guys do it we have this big team of<br>programmers and we cannot keep up how<br>you manage them to do it and the idea is<br>you know you just you get lots of people<br>to do this little piece and pretty soon<br>you've got a lot of code may not give<br>this code you don't love other so the<br>one possibility is that we try and do<br>exactly what happened with our and<br>there's a real question that can't<br>happen again and for start do we have<br>sufficient underpinning to do that but<br>we don't know but if we build it the<br>lake home I don't know so it's an<br>interesting question I don't know that<br>I'm going to be around to really think<br>about that so inspired by what's<br>happened over the past 20 years of my<br>career that i'll plan which I really and<br>go to Vinci go fishing so I plan to do<br>that in the next year or two maybe there<br>will be a new generation of people who<br>don't pick this up and we go anywhere I<br>think I can about all the fun when<br>you're going to get out of it but<br>keynote so let's gather it's kind of a<br>statisticians apology for getting<br>involved into computing and I hope<br>Lee Jung Christians to review and equus<br>to do it well I human developers our<br>first rains were Ross and Robert so you<br>named it after asides it's also trail<br>yes but yeah it was a joke we never<br>thought anybody outside of the papal to<br>use it so they can make their kind of<br>children if we knew really now we<br>probably would have been more modest so<br>you have an expression large x + y right<br>so that can be represented as plus with<br>an x and y now the X could also be an<br>expression a time base in times of the<br>Navy so a big mathematical computation<br>an expression can be represented as a<br>tree the way you evaluate that is you<br>just work around the tree do a bit<br>insensitive from the licorice with the<br>name of the language do you think even<br>if L hey I think it's important to have<br>something before and I have fun lots of<br>name but I know the person actually<br>writing the code and so that really<br>needs to be left up to him so I was<br>thinking I would like to call it nice<br>for your new interactive computing<br>there but it's not something I feel I<br>should know how i recently yeah when we<br>full started thinking about this we<br>wanted to see how things perform<br>flatlands actually not fast so if you're<br>truly if you call alien code you can<br>make it look fast but then you're in the<br>same problem is our scanners it's just<br>not that good how much money of them cut<br>your ass you're asking people to work<br>with Natalie and the editorial work is<br>the stuff that people really don't like<br>to do well this one part is that 42<br>windows nobody likes to innovate so<br>we've actually found money to pay people<br>to see but yeah so they're the models of<br>the neverland pirates I don't know<br>anyone is going to do it here because<br>it's not a scope as much bigger if you<br>are going to be the editorial person you<br>have to not only know about the<br>computing that you have to have this<br>huge encyclopedic knowledge of<br>statistics so at the very least you<br>leave committee and I'm not sure how to<br>skate night I asked my ex-wife and I<br>know<br>I haven't actually looked at it I'm not<br>sure that was a director right now yeah<br>so there is a huge encode and a lot of<br>it's interesting and we had kind of<br>discussed ways that you could approach<br>that so one of those to look at some<br>limited automatic translation from our<br>into this language the other option is<br>you could implement are in this new<br>language and then we get these things<br>that way so there's various forms of<br>compatibility you think of that I'm not<br>going to go too far down that road onto<br>like the work up something solid but yet<br>yeah and there are companies so they're<br>trying to take some money out of that<br>but I you know they're there is an hour<br>foundation does get contributions from<br>we can't charge because it's the GPL and<br>software that's just not going to and<br>there is a lot of goodwill and there is<br>a small amount of the nation it's not<br>huge I can we first take six years we've<br>got thirty thousand euros which we were<br>able to use to buy time on service great<br>the Wikipedia audiences vast okay down<br>we feel like they're a lot less but<br>they're really uh I tried and what it<br>came down to Elizabeth at some point<br>somebody changed the license of the<br>identifier from GPL to 20 GPM and that<br>was done without my say-so and so I<br>Lynch the Free Software Foundation they<br>said what we do about that and they said<br>essentially nothing because it will be<br>regarded as a dispute between partners<br>within the art project and will<br>revolutionise with the way of living<br>and I have to say the fact that we're<br>our co-creator was on the board of<br>revolution analytics meant that things<br>really weren't going to go it's unlikely<br>we'll talk the wind was brought up of<br>course and you got any plans this new<br>system to integrate our processing we're<br>trying not to exclude hospital when<br>Robert why did I we didn't even matters<br>this time we are trying to think of<br>terms of preserving the ability to run<br>phrase to do some sort of processing to<br>use vectorized technical processes while<br>that may not actually built in initially<br>we hope you delete the space their<br>credential<br>so NE regrette ah this new language<br>again so i started up as a small thing<br>with Jesus slap stuff on because good to<br>say is getting fit once more view is<br>there a single sign on your NE povas new<br>one visit of Gibbons does nothing Noble<br>or does the most basic events well that<br>the other much you got verify that<br>you've got the ability to do a rain<br>manipulation we would immediately start<br>finding things like la pack and<br>numerical analysis phase and then it's<br>not too hard to actually start moving<br>typical regression programs to lose a<br>code so the classical side of statistics<br>would come along feel it quickly there<br>are the other thing about a lot of work<br>that's done for our is it's not actually<br>in there's a very thin interfaces are<br>over C will seep as possible future and<br>we definitely know that those who you<br>were namely occurred in this them so<br>that would give us access big chunk of<br>stuff just rewriting with superficial<br>differences and so that could be there's<br>other things talking about my cracks<br>that's that's a big thing to redesign<br>would be good to do it but the graphics<br>and I will not will not appeal at all so<br>this important lot of really to know<br>reminds them xiii i stole the graphics<br>directly from s not having my idisk<br>source code of the time but i did my<br>best you are really making long as<br>they're so with john chambers and folder<br>my phone actually little bit guilty<br>about such a great steel and he said<br>none i don't worry about I stole from<br>some of the air<br>I said he actually stole it from the<br>four train sovereignty live event that<br>was around with his substance and one of<br>the things that people say about our is<br>they really like it to the good it's<br>always going to be viable for the kind<br>of problems it's viable for now what's<br>more viable for gigantic problems and<br>it's already my Bible favelas so so long<br>as you look with smaller problems you<br>find it's really the bigger things and<br>you know if you want to met a collection<br>of data these days this is over like<br>that stuff out there so depending on<br>which area you are interested in Drury<br>there or it's not gonna matter no and<br>we're hoping not to limit ourselves to<br>them so we are hoping to have a<br>streaming model we stream stuff through<br>you can't do everything that way but<br>there's a little about a statistical<br>computations candy that's what's a<br>sizzling around again with not going to<br>limit hassle to try new things as<br>i do get samples from time to time and<br>being a linux really sexy they don't<br>fret<br>it's recently static with brandon is<br>going to finish is currently in the next<br>and at that point really so everyone<br>gave like to thank you have this small<br>token of appreciation thank you very<br>much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
