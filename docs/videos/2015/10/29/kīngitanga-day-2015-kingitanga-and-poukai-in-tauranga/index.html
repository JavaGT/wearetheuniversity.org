tomatillo bukovina tofutti guna<br>funny for you para para me every paper<br>or coup for the pad kill a photo I just<br>want to quickly say that normally would<br>have our big volunteer those of you who<br>know us I would know that we always have<br>our longley would have our these cutter<br>here with us who do you a new pair here<br>with us as well to tell the story as<br>they know it because they know it beast<br>than we do but at the end of the day we<br>needed to come through and just support<br>the Clower so it's a bit of our money<br>why he need day today as you can see and<br>we're all going to just you know defend<br>and help to share the call it all our<br>stories as we know it from beginning to<br>connection in terms of our relationship<br>with pony and it's a pleasure for us to<br>be here actually it's an honor and a<br>pleasure for us all to be here today so<br>killed a puto what I tried to do here<br>was set out a presentation in terms of<br>the connection to Tony pop has spoken a<br>little about the relationship stuff<br>a Papa and the other bullet point there<br>in the relationship with to Priya and<br>between 2pm mahalaya and tomatillo<br>porque senior himself tomatillo poor guy<br>seniors really<br>important to this whole relationship<br>that we had with Tony back in 1955 King<br>aquatic he came to who here to open our<br>funny to Pune the first committee apple<br>gave in and it was back there where maha<br>Raya had spoken of the desire for no<br>tamarama helium and I to have the poco<br>and so the call it all began from that<br>event and in in 1958 it was realized<br>when the first pope I was held at hooli<br>Emma right under the auspices of keen<br>Kutter key Kenya kyllikki rain from<br>nineteen thirty three to nineteen<br>sixty-six and it was at the opening of<br>comet tempel caffeine were the offer was<br>made then tomatillo become the center<br>for the meetings a center for the<br>meetings of the mighty king in other<br>words his footstool and so the<br>relationship began at their particular<br>pokin discussion took place and focused<br>on the hundred hundred and vishy of the<br>King movement so that was timely<br>actually it just you know just worked in<br>well because it was our first PO Chi and<br>it coincided with a big event that was<br>about to happen the weekend after and<br>say for Julio for the people of night to<br>malama hall there was a really special<br>special time a Papa these are<br>comets that are pulled out of our<br>booklets to coincide with the 50th<br>anniversary of our Pope I we did some<br>research and pull together this booklet<br>Tim Mahoney tanger or depot pie and this<br>was to celebrate 50 years of Pope I and<br>who you Malone<br>and in here I've just taken comments<br>from this booklet to share with you but<br>we have a number of these books and we<br>bought a few they're not not to go<br>around by the looks of things to<br>everyone but you know we've got some at<br>home and if you're interested in<br>accessing any of these books and just<br>let us know but inside the book it gives<br>you more detail in terms of what we're<br>trying to share with you today the<br>up of itself for the King to go out on a<br>limb for nye tomorrow on the<br>a Papa records records would have been<br>double checked and the King sponsorship<br>and prisons carefully managed now that's<br>notice in our book because that came out<br>of the original this booklet here which<br>was used on their first day for their<br>celebration of the first pope I back in<br>nineteen fifty eight and then there's<br>literally little bit more there's the<br> up over and suck just to reinforce<br>the up upper inside of the door<br>what you see here on the on the side<br>there is the photo Papa and then up<br>opposites with an inside the funny<br>chicken at amity to the right as you<br>come inside the meeting house and that<br>gives you the connection if you like in<br>terms of our connection as I have food<br>as an earring back to the true to the<br>Quintana the a Papa which had a<br>place of honor was directly linked to<br>the king thus legitimize the identity of<br>the happens in the eyes of the more to<br>sound white eris and includes the art<br>Ain a new car who now that was the<br>corridor from Francis winiata maharajas<br>wife<br>getting on to the relationship princess<br>deploy your strength and nighttime of<br>our whole link through Maharaja he<br>supported who work with in White kettle<br>during the back years of rope / 2 and<br>the speed to previous version for her<br>why cattle we've was a template for<br>nighttime around to also rise again like<br>the phoenix from the ashes of<br>despondency as we all know though Patti<br>has been a what's weird it has been at<br>Omaha it has been taboo it has been<br>stressful it has been you know there's<br>so many things to our people in terms of<br>what has come from ropa to and back in<br>those days no matter certainly was<br>prominent in terms of the land wars and<br>in terms of the confiscation of all<br>Valens even though for nato na na mahal<br>Howland mess or loss wasn't as great as<br>why cattle the impacts and you know<br>everything they came with that lean loss<br>was pretty much the same that we all<br>okay the PO Chi is an institution of the<br>King movement it is an occasion when the<br>tribes gather to offer the loyal<br>affection to the King a central feature<br>is the key haircutting which in itself<br>is an expression of feelings of<br>generosity friendliness hospitality<br>towards the least privileged ideals<br>basic to the King movement now I just<br>want to cut off into there and talk a<br>little bit about the planning and the<br>preparation that goes into the actual<br>poker itself I am I'm probably in my<br>life I won't tell you fully how old I am<br>but all of my life are probably only<br>miss maybe a couple of poke I but as a<br>child growing up with my parents I was<br>witness all of my siblings we were<br>witness to what the loyalty that our<br>parents head for the poke I'm the love<br>the head for the Pope I for the<br>Kingitanga just the privilege and honor<br>of being able to host Tony the King<br>eating and I grew up in that era and I<br>came to love it too and I consider it to<br>be just that one day in the year a labor<br>of love and I say that to my children<br>and I say that to my mokopuna because it<br>must go on for the generations and so<br>for my father and for many of our far no<br>ornate omarama hall thanks to tradition<br>and in order to continue their tradition<br>we must maintain and sustain our belief<br>our support for the King Italian and for<br>just through the hosting of our<br>I helps us to just keep their<br>relationship strong now I also have the<br>role of the woman's committee<br>chairperson we run the man I basically<br>and your woman woman I don't know what<br>happened to our mean maybe we got too<br>smart I don't know or too good at what<br>we weren't doing in you know but anyway<br>oh yeah look I just like to save in just<br>for a bit of a cutter our woman's<br>committee run the PO Chi and probably<br>about two months out every year we<br>stabbed plan for the PO Chi and it's a<br>huge money because we need to consider<br>where we're going to get funding from we<br>need to consider and this is a parallel<br>I'll go back to the old days of how we<br>do it nowadays it's pretty much we look<br>at call her we put out to our far no and<br>invitation to support the Pope I by way<br>of a cool huh and then from there we set<br>the menus and progress and just over the<br>last two maybe three years Charlie we've<br>kind of changed things a little in terms<br>of in terms of our menu where we have<br>got some really good Chiefs and so we<br>decided we'll give the Kings table a<br>different menu from everybody else<br>whether that's right or wrong but we<br>love doing there anyway but the first<br>time we did that and the comment that<br>came from my team to Haiti was he<br>referred to our dining room mr. but the<br>region hooyah so we obviously made an<br>impression on him but the idea was to<br>test ourselves in terms of what we could<br>do and just see if it will jam you know<br>be something that we could carry through<br>overtime and so once they put the stake<br>in the ground to do things like<br>I'm referring to our ships then I've<br>said to them you gotta carry that on now<br>mate you can't stop so therein lies the<br>challenge for all our new ships but yeah<br>you know planning goes goes out there<br>six to two months prior we have meetings<br>the money that comes on board with us<br>every year is to derana cheat Elena or<br>pity narco but I they always come on<br>board with us and vice versa they can<br>they can't always make it because it<br>clashes with the who yard owner but<br>they're always there to support us which<br>is really important for our people and<br>our next generation coming through to<br>remember those sorts of things they<br>support us by way of core are free<br>porker offering up some a couple of pigs<br>for us to be able to use for the toe<br>hair cutting and so we really appreciate<br>that but it's a bringing together you<br>know the hub who the far no to just<br>support the day and it shows how<br>important the pro players to them also<br>going back in terms of that parallel how<br>we do things now is maybe the dollar<br>value we ask for their core ha but in<br>the days evolved you know our people our<br>people used to i'm just going to push it<br>back I've got little comments here they<br>come out of the book again poker for the<br>new PA your notebook he's one of our far<br>no to maharaja asked him to be in charge<br>of playing movies and various modern in<br>the morni to raise funds by pigs for the<br>poco another comment from hubby cougar<br>without needing to prompt people people<br>readily gave forth with their presents<br>pickles the chow-chow and vegetables all<br>kinds we beat the pork and the mutton<br>and also appeared they also tuned up<br>this court error was prevalent<br>throughout motto around the more to and<br>for who you or so when the Pope came<br>around and that was our team up his core<br>little nanny hope he has gone on now and<br>then i just finished with that that<br>little okie at the bottom<br>martowardojo marta risotto and that's so<br>befitting of how our people really<br>worked hard in the days and dads days<br>and nannies days you know to make I to<br>make sure that our Pope I was supported<br>our tiny out visit our visitors our<br>money Hideo feed well and there was a<br>commitment and the love and the honor<br>that the head for the Pope I and for the<br>okay I'm gonna ask me a few if she'd<br>like to stand up and have a little bit<br>of a ya doin tie him to me ever I hope<br>care for the auto gravity than a normal<br>might not get a favorable game after a<br>career 0 to make up with the multiple<br>time oh you know the hoodie and a help<br>you develop proper Brower keeping give a<br> a terrible career until Papa Papa<br>robot now the mayor daley quia a Marlin<br>our home without 1952 and by 1958 I had<br>had three children so my alliance as far<br>as I was concerned was to my children<br>into my father so II i would go down to<br>my mother either he doe to what we would<br>normally call today to Jake it what the<br> I wasn't there because those days<br>the poke I was held over the weekend<br>Friday said they in sunday so it was<br>quite a busy time for my people but as I<br>admit I never had much to do with it for<br>you know game my husband died in<br>nineteen fifty eight so and while living<br>at his huh boo of natty hung and I'll i<br>started or after he died nodded in 1995<br>was when he died sorry and i started to<br>become involved with these on the mother<br>and naughty hello so eventually I became<br>the clear corner of that mud I and as it<br>says here after he had died I became<br>more involved with things on mamala and<br>its most especially when the Waitangi<br>tribunal sittings began in hoolian<br>because I have to admit I didn't know<br>all the stories about my Mariah hoodia<br>so I went back and he submitted a<br>submission and that was where I lived<br>all the troubles all the trials and all<br>the jumping up and down that my career<br>clover did prior to my knowing what had<br>been going on at night amala wahoo and<br>of course what happened to us as a hobby<br>with the lands and that the land had<br>been given or put under the umbrella of<br>the King autauga movement to keep it<br>safe for what we had over huh boo of my<br>drama wah-wah-whoo so and eventually<br>have to admit also that Monson for all<br>but made me really go back to my mother<br>was the rebuilding of the second<br>komatipoort I Finland which now stands<br>on our mother and he's beautiful so<br>there must what took me back there and I<br>became really really involved with my my<br>ID then I was a queer kelowna I still AM<br>if they still have me I'm getting below<br>but however I made it my job that I<br>would hopefully try and fulfill what I<br>had done for my husband that I hadn't<br>and well I did attend the 40th<br>anniversary wave and I currently mean<br>but too much about it but I can tell you<br>the 50th anniversary was fantastic it<br>was a wonderful celebration by my<br>husband find my mother and it was held<br>over the weekend more or less and even<br>came to haiti and his partner stayed<br>over the weekend and I think we had a<br>wonderful time to celebrate the fact<br>that yes we do hold the PO Chi as our<br>mud I then I can say now that i have<br>been really involved with it i'm really<br>proud to say i am most grateful for the<br>fate that we do hold a pipe okay at<br>night tomorrow at hooli a male and<br>Mariah must have known something when he<br>really did ask that we have the Polka at<br>William because I can see now it has<br>benefited us more than we can say under<br>the umbrella of the king of tiny it<br>wasn't only him it was towards the end<br>of the reign of AD kingly tap I Magna<br>Carta and I'll always be grateful to<br>know that choose to sleep at hulia when<br>it was held the weekends was no problem<br>for her sleep in tomorrow and not going<br>sleep at the motels like we like to say<br>we want to them<br>as I'm saying that rather partly about<br>them now it was fantastic it I have to<br>say I admired her and of course I<br>admiring him and I'm asking the Lord<br>that he look after him and keep him<br>there terrain for us but Jesus I say<br>well I have must have learned something<br>when he asked for a key that we have the<br>Polka a two year because who here has<br>benefited greatly from their association<br>with the King through the PO Chi<br>movement and proud to say well I am that<br>we do have the PO Chi at hoodia it's<br>fantastic it's wonderful then it brings<br>two people together under the umbrella<br>of the King tongue movement and as I say<br>here my
