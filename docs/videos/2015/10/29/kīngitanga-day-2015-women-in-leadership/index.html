to<br>tomorrow people to key in monopoly<br>bikini Tatiana's follow I have no lady<br>can immediately clear to hate yet I<br>camellia Pope my catheter if you know<br>that vector math wahala might c'mon<br>amaechi's illuminate and Cara Maya OH no<br>cook et al my and all right activity yet<br>i'm tina we could start with you get a<br>fun night since my phone ahead then Alma<br>here I won't go into the deep and<br>meaningful but basically come from<br>center of the universe to Danny and I<br>like to call the mother leaned the<br>fatherland is wiping all bathed fed upon<br>that interval so I'm I have dual<br>citizenship so i can throw an attitude<br>for a talk I just go geese wanted to<br>start by saying it is really really<br>awesome to be with a group of rob my<br>sister's actually and it's great to be<br>in a room full of wine and Marty and so<br>just shut up to the mean we came today<br>you know I think you're great in your<br>the future we wanted to say and I wanted<br>to give a really brief call it or today<br>um so I do it for a parka corporate and<br>I've been doing that for the last two<br>years three years but have spent my life<br>in OE businesses and so today I wanted<br>to talk I guess a little bit about the<br>highs and hires in week of working with<br>you eat because working with eerie as a<br>calling and it's got work as I keep<br>reminding myself as we have seven day<br>weeks and you know what we struggle with<br>its getting people to come home so what<br>we get is a whole lot of you know we<br>invest a lot of money in education<br>grants and people go to other companies<br>and so I want to talk about the highs of<br>working in here because it's an<br>addictive drug because when you get it<br>right nothing else compares if we<br>mainstream job you get nothing else<br>compares and in fact the only people who<br>I know who are mighty who work in<br>corporates work for Marty in the<br>culprits because it is a calling so this<br>is their series of random reflections<br>because I dish that and in the 252<br>almighty trust board when I was 18 and<br>so my father aggressors from to<br>furniture and it was expected that we<br>would always work in the tribe so it<br>started very early in<br>have worked for two fighting tour now to<br>pro in really any other year we didn't<br>have me over the last few years in and<br>so I just wanted I guess to give a first<br>reflection of what it's like working in<br>Yui and so for me listen this is it I<br>got through to my cousins I get to with<br>my uncles and my auntie's every day I<br>got to grow up in an environment where<br>you know I got to love my blood I have a<br>master's degree in geography from this<br>wonderful universities that correct to<br>come back go buddy wanna go but but it<br>also means that I got to grow in what<br>end learn by osmosis and just came back<br>from attaining actually and to dhoni in<br>realizing that the guard is changing and<br>that I've had to take a bite a lot of my<br>uncles and realizing that now when I<br>stand up it's usually I was usually to<br>support someone else and that's changing<br>and that is freaking me out on every<br>level but working in the Eyrie means<br>that you get to be yourself every day<br>you get to live I know some like Oprah<br>your authentic self but it but it's true<br>in I am I credit that to my father and<br>mother who who raised me in a very<br>distinct you know united 232 environment<br>in people would have you ring the trust<br>board and say oh I know I'm too funny<br>tour and I'd like to get a grant and I'd<br>go I'll cup I or watch your pop<br>up and they'd say well isn't that your<br>job and I see no who was your parents<br>and so you know there is<br>of entitlement and actually if you<br>really want to secure Marty development<br>steps in the home it's not don't look to<br>the e to save you like we look to the<br>crown to save us look to ourselves and<br>so I'm raising a young 15 year old who<br>is now representing me at the technique<br>because I came to be here took her out<br>of st. Joe's so she could work in the<br>kitchen so so she's doing them a and so<br>you know but working in a mari<br>organization means that you get to live<br>authentically every day um this is what<br>I mean about that because I currently<br>work I currently work in a mainstream<br>organization and I work with copper and<br>you know I had to explain to my boss<br>it's a problem only Marty understood I<br>said tomorrow I've got to go to a teeny<br>and I can only go for a day and he was<br>like so I said oh geez it shades you<br>can't just turn up for one day you know<br>it invents the other great thing about<br>working in a way you don't have to<br>justify yourself constantly for who you<br>are you get to be who you are in a way<br>that not only encourages the people<br>around you but encourages the people on<br>the mirai and it carriages out some of<br>the key to think that it's okay and i<br>often tell the story of the whisperers<br>and it's going to be famous probably cuz<br>i tell't everywhere I go but when I<br>first that at a Content energy and you<br>know fits on out of the closet party<br>obviously and it contact their caps and<br>other rigid and Fran faces and we used<br>to sit in our meetings in every now and<br>then someone would lean over to me and<br>say I'm nighttime and I'd go oh it's not<br>a disease<br>but there it is literally how it's like<br>in mainstream corporate New Zealand<br>because people are scared that that will<br>hinder their ability to climb up the<br>corporate letter and so you know I put<br>that there to say it is important to<br>live it every day and not just at home<br>because the non Marty and our<br>organization has grown greatly because<br>of their affiliation and association<br>with us they've actually got more out of<br>our than we've gotten out of him but you<br>know that that's an important part of<br>their growth and the story also tell the<br>time a castle with mobile so when I<br>first started it contact energy I had<br>been there for about six months and it's<br>it's very very isolating to be coming<br>from a mono cultural organization we<br>have enormous brown to go into a mono<br>cultural environment weaver one's wife<br>so I know all about 10 cultural<br>environment it's just I know which one I<br>hyper foo so Finley six months and my<br>bossy to me how are you doing you know I<br>can tell you really struggling in this<br>environment and I said yeah yeah it is<br>it's been really really tough and it's<br>the Marty thing here's ah thank you so<br>much for bringing it up what's the<br>elephant in the room I see what do you<br>mean any seeds you know that let's see<br>nan Austin Powers when there's a guy<br>with the mole and all you can see them<br>all and all he sees is volleyball Emily<br>don't you see it every time I'm in the<br>room he keeps thinking of something<br>Marty so it's money money money if they<br>bring up the treaty over bring a he know<br>like like it's weird and that story<br>always brings to mind that there are<br>some really clear stereotypes and in<br>that mighty mighty mighty thing is often<br>not borne out of racism it's often born<br>out of ignorance and fear in giving them<br>a open environment to have that<br>conversation but you always got to draw<br>a line sometimes they get a little bit<br>too<br>you know and sometimes they cross and<br>you going to slip it back but but you've<br>got to be open enough to hear the<br>conversations because we are they're<br>going to go so if you don't tell our<br>story if you don't tell people what I<br>our identity is the vacuum will fill<br>with their own stories and so I'm the<br>heat of of sustainability it contains<br>and so again when I got there they were<br>need to teach you about sustainability<br>you're right because the most<br>sustainable businesses and new zealand<br>today at your businesses mighty trusts<br>and corporations are the epitome of<br>sustainability we just don't call it<br>that we've been doing it for you know<br>people take a dozen years and so they I<br>think have come to understand the<br>importance and commercial each of using<br>a framework that you know other<br>organizations particularly in the states<br>they're coming to recognize that at the<br>way we do things are what is what they<br>are aspiring to so again there is a<br>commercial each and understanding in<br>living Marty paradigms so we you know<br>it's give and take and I read this stuff<br>and then I translated into what we do<br>and they go ah ok so that's really<br>important I think to about my<br>experiences in both Marty organizations<br>in a non muddy organizations is that<br>again if you continue to love who you<br>are you will be different you will stand<br>out and you will have integrity and that<br>to me is very important well our flight<br>is the story of my life i'm very<br>impatient as people will know and i have<br>to keep telling myself this life as a<br>marathon not a sprint and i think i'm<br>i'm hitting the big 40 next year and was<br>that comes a level of maturity i like to<br>thank<br>it's not really true but it's nice to<br>say that kind of made me realize that it<br>is not my lifetime and I will not see<br>the things that I wanted my lifetime and<br>I know everyone talks about that we're<br>intergenerational people and we think<br>long-term I have never I'm all about the<br>now I want things done today because our<br>people are struggling now and I just<br>kind of collect that okay it's not going<br>to happen in my lifetime and the<br>decisions I make I found out the<br>foundational decisions for the future<br>and I had to reflect on my<br>great-grandfather for that they offered<br>grace who was the first secretary of the<br>two financial trust board and in 1926 he<br>negotiated the late fee agreement for<br>fishing access to Lake topol in almost<br>100 years later it turned into us owning<br>the title of make tofu in having full<br>commercial rights over that lake and we<br>own not only that the lake but the ear<br>column above it and so I had to remember<br>that actually grandpa for Tata didn't<br>know that 80 years from now we would be<br>in a position where we owned the lake<br>and we can he ever say unfit infected<br>tumans who commercially uses that Lake<br>he didn't know he didn't know what was<br>coming but he made some really<br>foundational decisions in his own<br>lifetime that have impacted us so I'm<br>trying to remember that although I'm so<br>so and remembering it all the time this<br>is my second to last me because this is<br>the story of my life and this is what<br>comes from working in erie organizations<br>is that you learn to be a job you learn<br>to take the Hutt's you learn to be<br>resilient and you learn to be creative<br>in heaven woods and mainstream<br>organizations I've realized how how our<br>unique set of skills that creates so you<br>know you get a knock at work you think<br>it's think then you go to the Brian get<br>hammered by your nannies and you're like<br>right let sit for someone<br>big tough because you just brought<br>resiliency you go your monoi meetings<br>first Sunday of every month for me<br>anyway and you know you're constantly<br>getting smashed constant it is what it<br>is we have diverse realities in poverty<br>is an underlying issue for our people<br>which means that when we go to the who<br>fits what comes out that's just reality<br>so you know what that creates in an<br>individual and an individual working and<br>organizations and is in agility that<br>they're spending millions of dollars<br>trying to check the chi teach their<br>executive leadership for me I recommend<br>you go to OE first cut your teeth there<br>because if you can come out of their<br>life then no one is ever going to be<br>able to push you down and willing<br>several who is my mentor and when i lick<br> here and i said i'm going back to<br>erie first he said do not do it it's my<br>uncle seven seas they were flogged a<br>willing walls and you know you will be<br>less for it and I don't believe I it I<br>believe I have built a character based<br>on that work that has enabled me to deal<br>with a lot of things that probably other<br>people haven't had the opportunity to do<br>in working in areas like working and a<br>mini government you get to do everything<br>gets do everything using social services<br>you're dealing with education you're<br>dealing with commercial you're dealing<br>with advocacy in the political space it<br>is exciting it's an exciting space so I<br>think that's what I like what yeah and<br>another another good when you do go to<br>UE I've lot dude this very well either<br>so my my cousin seeds to me because I<br>was always fighting against the machine<br>aging gives the machine no fighting<br>fighting and when I have any side any<br>you know in their bit conversation why<br>cuz I see cuz gonna be the pumice what<br>the hell are you talking about being in<br>common this is going to be the Commerce<br>on alike lead the way so just go with it<br>gotta be Thomas I said I want to be the<br>promise not to be the wave but again<br>getting over and I realized that pick<br>your battles sometimes you have to be<br>the pumice but IM you acted to put it on<br>the other side so i I've got to put on<br>the other side so I'm the way the truth<br>and then finally my last night was then<br>this fundamentally is what it's all<br>about we are already awesome we were<br>also when we came over from Hawaiki so<br>we should not forget that and should not<br>be intimidated by a majority that<br>continuously tries to tell us that we at<br>least just hit the Romans up we are all<br>thank you for that i teach<br>sustainability so i was really<br>interested in what you have to say it<br>and in my acting from the corporate<br>world and in my own journey looking at<br>leaving the Western model and looking at<br>indigenous models including mauryan how<br>knowledge is passed on and what's valued<br>and just the timing so I really<br>appreciate your remarks our next speaker<br>is couple of Smith's turn out by five<br>o'clock for his attorney famosa away<br>acapella from Lansing IEP huh blue<br>called soooo robe de mer I romantic<br>throw hope wasn't for her team I think<br>they have work habits that have to<br>follow Tina for that but only that you<br>do an awesome presentation but she works<br>I work for him so it's a bit hard to<br>follow that and to talk about our<br>experiences it weird secondly what I'm<br>going to do so I we've containers team<br>I'm on the communications team but<br>before I talk about that i should say i<br>lived here and i recognize a lot of my<br>friends from from my time living here in<br>Hamilton so he kept code though my<br>experience has been that I have always<br>worked for cocoa for Mardi teams and<br>organizations and moving across the<br>contact was actually my first experience<br>going into a the private sector but be<br>into a mainstream audience we're<br>maintena make up one of one small<br>portion of the five percent of Mardi who<br>would provoke a contact so to put that<br>in perspective we have 1000 staff spread<br>over around 20 different sites across<br>New Zealand then equate to about two to<br>three Marty precise so there's three of<br>us and our team<br>money and Wellington so it's a very<br>different experience to what to what I<br>can come from and what I thought I'd<br>just talk about today are some of my<br>learnings and reflections about that<br>shift working in copán almighty teams to<br>go into a mainstream organization as<br>well as sharing some strategies for<br>surviving and their environment so first<br>listen I thought I talked about is I had<br>to adjust my focus I was not in Kansas<br>anymore so private out the contact goes<br>to look for the minister Marty fears<br>it's free secretary I was a researcher I<br>worked at martini with the University of<br>Auckland of a global place should we<br>save it perhaps but an every roll over<br>head our focus has been on Marty<br>development and when you're working on<br>paper / Maori initiatives you have an<br>expectation they turn although it's not<br>even need to be passionate and see it<br>you all come from the same starting<br>point some things you take for granted<br>like working with me and seed you know<br>some of these to go and do farm o stuff<br>you can go someone has any you let them<br>go it's a baseline knowledge that you<br>build up the most organizations and when<br>you go over some mainstream organization<br>not only are those assumptions or you<br>know not only are they not there the<br>support systems that you're used to<br>their starting point is way back here so<br>i went from which lon co papa you know<br>really afford a Copa for like a<br>composition of cobalt are white to make<br>sure that everyone is represented and<br>you know you're dealing with the<br>dynamics of intricacies of hopeful in<br>early relationships with each other to<br>working on does this really haven't met<br>hang on entering where we can we sit at<br>that spot for practice in advice you<br>know so it's a bit of an adjustment it's<br>an adjustment and your own expectations<br>about your role in advancing a Copa<br>formality and the main stand an<br>organizational and coming from a Copa<br>for my background you know you don't<br>just drop the Pope up at the door right<br>penis piercing one does not simply walk<br>away from co people are being killed we<br>take it with you everywhere you go but<br>you need to realize that you're in a<br>different environment and adjust your<br>expectations you also got to realize<br>that even though it feels like a small<br>menial task you're actually making<br>advances for Marty and June's just being<br>in the organization and being Miley and<br>be proud of me has made incremental<br>differences in the way that our company<br>perhaps I mean it looks like a roller<br>coaster meeting that we have up and down<br>today we're proud of the Monday and then<br>with our shame but that's the journey<br>that's the journey when you're<br>supporting people to adjust to being a<br>bit more culturally inclusive in these<br>systems the secret learning was I am the<br>mighty excuse and my organization this<br>well to fear to the one who knows better<br>there's always someone in the room who<br>knows better than you when it comes to<br>Maori cultural issues or non aquatic<br>we're seeing the women in our jokers<br>between the two of us when we go into a<br>queen they ask that something about<br>Marty we say well on behalf of all Marty<br>people yes well sometimes you need to<br>know is set on behalf for Marty people<br>going in a teaspoon bring them in you<br>know because it's beyond rates to tease<br>but when you're working in a mainstream<br>organizations sometimes you know that's<br>what they think they see you and it may<br>not necessarily be your job so I don't<br>have a my role I have a general role but<br>I take on the Mount of sight because it<br>would shame me out if they did it wrong<br>so we take their responsibility on<br>ourselves to make sure they do it<br>properly and it's actually quite hard I<br>joke I don't intend i call it my our<br>modern food because you've got to pick<br>your best you've got to decide what's<br>important enough to push and what you<br>can just live with because it is you<br>know and you know there's a constant<br>light straddling between tokenism and an<br>authentic development and you're<br>constantly straddling straddling that<br>line as the Mardi advocates in your<br>organization be experts so I'm that's<br>been a real learning learning curve the<br>other one is knowing your value as a<br>Marty and what you bring to the table<br>when you go to an organisation you're<br>expected to be a technical experience to<br>deliver on your job but at the same time<br>coming from a mighty background you know<br>you've got to be able to Marty while<br>you're there<br>but it's not all about that experience<br>but it's not all about that measure I<br>should say because actually just being<br>mighty brings a lot of ending to an<br>organization and I've learnt that over<br>the time as the sort of settled into our<br>team's diversity Metis to organizations<br>but also so does social licence to<br>operate and the skill we bring to the<br>table is mine and the relationships we<br>build the way we work you know our<br>worldview brings value to an<br>organization they do recognize that<br>whether they may feel like that or not<br>so you've got to constantly recognize<br>your own value and maintain their<br>confidence in yourself part of it is<br>just being the outlier and the<br>organization is someone different you<br>know it comes it does affect your<br>conference in a workplace and a lot of<br>man is internal talk a lot of that is<br>external talk me and Tina had a big<br>Queen one day about micro depression and<br>in the small ways that people are owed<br>your confidence and your ability so<br>that's what I say you know you've got to<br>be an expert technicians got a native<br>stuff and your job that you've also<br>so that's sort of the context and let me<br>share with you some of the strategies<br>that we've gotten our team to sort of<br>survive and a weak place like this this<br>one is really effective Tina's building<br>your team around you it sucks being the<br>only one person and your organization<br>whose mari so Tina had the good sense to<br>build a mighty team around you so<br>history of us but we're also lucky<br>enough to have fun with the juve on our<br>board who's absolutely wonderful he's a<br>staunch advocate he looks after us keeps<br>an eye on us so that's been a great<br>winning formula just so happens we'll<br>Matic Pro second one is you need to know<br>when to call in the cavalry so the scope<br>vector picking your battles what you<br>need to know what's an issue that's big<br>enough where you actually need to give<br>someone is gilda the twin and there are<br>often times we met happen sometimes you<br>can deal with it internally and antenna<br>histories was hot back hop and them but<br>it is actually a hard experience because<br>sometimes I go home and you just feel<br>like you sold a piece of yourself if you<br>let something go and it's important to<br>you culturally but in a mainstream<br>organization and in particular our<br>organization which draws their resources<br>from our natural resources you know this<br>is something we deal with on the daily<br>the next one is to build your networks<br>whether they're in your organization or<br>not because external organizations can<br>put just as much support around you just<br>as much pressure on your organization to<br>advance culturally and as an internal<br>webcam and so something that we've been<br>doing is building relationships with<br>others who support our position and the<br>organization and strategically provide<br>support to initiatives that we want to<br>run with Marty communities and then the<br>final one there's the excellent at your<br>job but don't forget the co papa so this<br>is the first I've told you this is the<br>first time I've booked and a party her<br>organization but I'm still mindful that<br>I have jobs to do<br>and making it easier for other Marty to<br>come through even if it is the party<br>optimization we try to build a culture<br>of supporting Marty leisure we have<br>mentoring programs we try to build<br>relationships of my so that they can<br>come in and they can learn they can take<br>back to the even if they want to that's<br>fine but we need to build our technical<br>expertise as well as our neighborhoods<br>as long as people who are confident and<br>working in these environments and that's<br>about me Tilda thank you for that and I<br>think one of the things that resonated<br>for me is that pull between professional<br>and personal and I think a lot of us can<br>identify with that and that challenge of<br>walking in the door to our professional<br>life and feeling like we can hold our<br>head high with our personal values so I<br>appreciated your survival strategy thank<br>Jeremiah no hotel party faux pas de deux<br>stroke wing wah here no Ronnie normal<br>condo irony from nats pro-nazi done you<br>teehee natty we I am a senior associate<br>a corporate law firm in Auckland called<br>Chapman trip so I have a very different<br>perspective from my turtle he knew who<br>have just spoken I went to law school<br>ending straight from law school I went<br>into another corporate law firm as wheat<br>near 43 years in then change to Chapman<br>trip and so I guess I'm giving you a<br>different perspective and end and<br>hopefully encouraging you all to think<br>about that is a career path or<br>some of the strategies that I've used<br>personally to be a Modi in a big<br>corporate in so when I was growing up<br>and when I was at Law School in at<br>university I in in the household i was<br>in Maori economic development was<br>basically a topic that was part of our<br>everyday conversation breakfast lunch in<br>dinner I don't really even understand<br>what that meant until now but I guess<br>it's always just been something that has<br>been part of of my development and in<br>seeing the mahi that in particular my my<br>dad does in so when I started working I<br>didn't really know what I wanted to do<br>when I grew up I still don't know<br>exactly what that is but I knew that it<br>had to be something to do with advancing<br>Maori in the commercial world and and so<br>one of my key messages is think about<br>what what it what is that thing that<br>gets you out of bed every day and what<br>is that sort of ultimate goal that you<br>want to achieve and that might be that<br>you want to be an expert in tidal Maori<br>and tequila Modi and then you want to<br>make sure that you teach as many people<br>as you possibly can in your lifetime to<br>also be experts in it so if that's your<br>thing then that is your thing and go for<br>it and be the best that you can and<br>doing that and on the way you'll have<br>lots of different roles and that's ok as<br>well so i think particularly for those<br>of you who are students at University<br>and just get a job when you leave<br>University because it's really important<br>to be a positive<br>member of society and you will learn<br>skills and you won't even realize it<br>that will contribute to you achieving<br>that ultimate goal in some way or<br>another and then you just check yourself<br>and you know every few months or every<br>year okay what am i doing what have I<br>learnt what what what is my thing that<br>gets me up in the morning and that might<br>change as well over time in it also okay<br>and so again when I come back to what<br>mine was it was I wanted to learn about<br>the commercial world and then I wanted<br>to help Maori with that a lot of that<br>was because I could see that through our<br>treatment process that we needed more<br>and more whatever still do need more and<br>more Maori people with commercial<br>expertise and that was something we<br>didn't really have it for example when I<br>look at my own family all my first<br>cousins are teachers it could a couple<br>Marty which is amazing and that is their<br>thing and that's what they're passionate<br>about and I'm going to see when I have<br>kids I'm going to seen them to their<br>cutter so they can learn from them and<br>but that's within one family we have<br>lots of real experts and only a couple<br>of us they are doing slightly different<br>things and so and so I thought that it<br>was important to follow that bit<br>commercial avenue and then when I ded<br>law school I just applied to every<br>single law firm and then I got a job in<br>so i went there and i didn't even<br>worried that i couldn't i couldn't go to<br>a new way to teach me how to be a lawyer<br>and I wouldn't want to and<br>a very high risk and so particularly I<br>think with law a wee bit different from<br>Tina you actually have to cut your teeth<br>with other people because you will make<br>mistakes and you don't want to get your<br>only way into trouble with their that's<br>not to say that you can't contribute in<br>other ways by by going to land trust<br>meetings in my meetings and so you can<br>learn about all those things that Tina<br>talked about from your nannies in your<br>co Wayne and you do need to head both of<br>those aspects but i think particularly<br>in the law accounting goes quite pure<br>sort of commercial things i would<br>recommend that you cut your teeth on<br>those with someone else and then bring<br>your expertise Beck back to your alien<br>hapu and and so yeah so I just got a job<br>with River and I just worked in three<br>years and I worked as hard as I possibly<br>could and I just decided that I was<br>going to be the best mau di could be<br>there and i was going to tell everyone<br>not to sit on table even go it doesn't<br>on that don't sit on that table and i<br>decide to just took it upon myself to<br>educate them and they would say oh a<br>three-day tangy and I said yeah what<br>what do you think you can grieve and one<br>day no so proud of it is 19 deceiving<br>very staunch about who you are but don't<br>be afraid to educate them in challenge<br>their assumptions and so then I was<br>lucky enough to get a call from my boss<br>and to say that they had been he's<br>married to a Mardi woman he'd been doing<br>some work for her t we for free in<br>and finally they were paying him and so<br>he could go he could go and build a team<br>around there and so and so similar to<br>Tina we have within a big corporate but<br>we've got about eight of us who are in<br>this inert team within Chapman trip<br>where we actively look to develop<br>relationships with gooey clients in<br>habbo in and we recruit specifically for<br>kids at law school who they don't have<br>to be fluent in your speakers but they<br>do have to show some willingness to<br>learn everybody used to do it today or<br>Molly course were they with us or the<br>whole way through and and they have to<br>have been sort of active in community<br>type initiatives either at university or<br>within their own mother I to show that<br>they and they're not just this ringing<br>up to say I'm from to fight or can I get<br>a grant so so we're quite specific about<br>building building that team around us<br>and so and I get a real kick out of<br>helping 34 land blocks I can feel our<br>trust in muddy in corporations on the<br>East Coast and sell their carbon credits<br>to a commercial third party and and get<br>some money out of it and and I had to go<br>to blindly I had to help one of our<br>litigators in the model in court all<br>part of this big it was a commercial<br>transaction but it had lots of elements<br>where we were all the time dealing with<br>the mighty landowners and and so and<br>that's what I love doing another example<br>worlds we helped the TT trust at North<br>they were having a they own the land<br>where the captain supermarket was and<br>unfortunately years ago on the 90s that<br>entered into a bed lease with the Parker<br>fella and so there was<br>a supermarket war going on up here so we<br>help them get some finance in place from<br>beings age and do the negotiations with<br>countdown and in an hour view and some<br>of the trustees didn't agree with us in<br>wits the model a call again and but in<br>our view they will be in a few more<br>years in a much better commercial<br>position from the newly structures that<br>we put in place then they were prior to<br>their in so again and we made sure that<br>the land wasn't is wasn't going to be at<br>risk so again that was a commercial deal<br>but we were dealing with with Marty<br>people the whole time is our clients and<br>you know if we time we had acquiesced<br>and start with a cutter here and all of<br>that stuff and so it was a commercial<br>another commercial transaction but but<br>you're working with Marty bigone in<br>feeling like you're helping them advance<br>advance and their needs and the other<br>thing when i talk to law students about<br>it and lots of the law students oakland<br>university in particular and all have a<br>you know what the most of the examples<br>of money lawyers that we see around at<br>all treaty lawyers and in depth has a<br>really important place and those<br>Waitangi tribunal reports particularly<br>at the moment and very interesting and<br>but in people say are you're selling out<br>you're in the big corporate you're<br>selling out who actually you know and<br>you people talk about undeveloped Marty<br>Lynn right everybody's in it before well<br>what does it mean that means the land is<br>not doing anything it's not earning an<br>income for the people who are the<br>beneficiaries of that land so at some<br>point you're going to need a commercial<br>person to help you earn some money of<br>set length or put in place or even if<br>you're not going to earn money you're<br>just going to<br>crying on it you're going to need<br>someone who helps you get some bank<br>lending in place to do that and so and<br>if you want to do go fix your mud I or<br>put on a lil while now or in or we're<br>not going to solve poverty but anything<br>to do with the social size of things you<br>need medical to do this and so at some<br>point along the way you're going to need<br>to do some commercial beaches in order<br>to achieve those social needs or at<br>least help channel that social funding<br>to where it should be going and so yeah<br>quite an evil and think about what it is<br>that that's your driver don't be afraid<br>for that to change over time and and for<br>your career path to change over time as<br>well but just along the way I guess just<br>make sure that you being the best that<br>you can be whatever it as you choose to<br>do<br>thank you for those comments I'm glad to<br>hear that you're sure in the Meritor<br>university of auckland university and<br>your your advice about go get a job but<br>follow your heart at the same time is<br>sure to thank you very much our next<br>speaker is maria tech kanawa Tina tato<br>why Teen a cutie own or flying at all<br>nor te kuiti law herculaneum owner just<br>have to played it last quarter Toby who<br>sits in our cocoa awesome to see you<br>here awesome to have some really<br>familiar faces but what warms my heart<br>most today is the CT Quincy High School<br>in my phone so my accordion or today's a<br>little bit different I don't think I'm<br>qualified to talk that much about<br>corporate I have been here three months<br>but what I can say is a corporate room<br>and they want us in none of us would be<br>there we didn't have anything to offer<br>and who we are so glad this is one of my<br>loves this is a Raglan so I grew up in t<br>quitting my mum now lives out here my<br>grandpa mine is surviving and green<br>print still there it's my other love<br>this is all party d my time so this all<br>party and it's a fine though home Steve<br>so these are the things that shape<br>places I'm going to run you through<br>basically a line of my woman in the<br>enabling mean deck behind in my examples<br>of leadership so this is a loca hurdle<br>cut and my bill carries who middle name<br>this is her daughter idiot up on a<br>kiddie Appa she is i carry who named<br>this is her daughter my grandmother i<br>can see limiting here one of her<br>the people who would go when she was<br>sick we do kids were saying stay home<br>this is my mum she probably would be<br>surprised I think of who is a leader but<br>and this is my guild and that's her line<br>in hopefully she can choose something<br>from that so that's my female line and<br>this is the welfare league so another<br>example of leadership and you look at<br>the power of that form and I look in<br>here and I see so much ahead of us are<br>actually really heartened by that these<br>are my nanny's on my dad's side so Nina<br>kind of us on the right and whom um<br>joinha maybe you hit it and we can keep<br>all

with<br>us hold up what about trifle side<br>what's that you know they want to<br>commercial I see there's a front door<br>and there's a back door buddies with<br>this acceleration and you must must must<br>understand juice and you enter through<br>the front door they will didn't decide<br>if you can go to the back door so is<br>there actually true four meters I mean<br>they have been the films being around<br>the back door before but I'm the one<br>who's going to wear it so i am going to<br>try as much as i can to sort of guide<br>that process and make sure we engage and<br>will understand

strong to<br>change it and it's not it's not nice<br>it's really not nice you know you get<br>accused of all thought you pull before<br>the courts and the courts say there's<br>nothing here you've got all of this sort<br>of thing it's not nice but you know in<br>your puku what is right and you've got<br>to followed it through um I'm a design<br>thinking coach apprentice so it's a<br>different Kazuma so it's a methodology<br>for innovation that really sets quite<br>closely and snuggling with how we are<br>and how we do things which is why I<br>write school that and I've just been<br>invited to be a member of an advisory<br>group for agritech accelerator because<br>why I'm amare woman passion for tech<br>parts of the patient I know nothing I<br>know nothing about tick very little

of Maori<br>especially in kind of the traditional<br>corporate sense and so good to hear that<br>double burden really of Mari and women<br>and what that means so thank you for<br>those comments our final speaker laughs<br>that's certainly not in it anyway least<br>kill a Tartar sorry for my voice of<br>Kauai capital T there are 2 30 American<br>TV reporter to hit Hinata the Waikato TV<br>the

teacher back and<br>Evan L intermediate and also another<br>someone from avondale college so we're<br>all from West Auckland here today so it<br>helps to bring me back to know where I<br>where I am and where I need to be and<br>what I really wanted to do today as the<br>last speaker was take you out of alterra<br>and share my experience abroad which has<br>been an amazing experience it's being<br>with other indigenous cultures and I'm<br>talking about London for 11 years and<br>the moment Middle East absolutely felt<br>like I belonged I got to really be with<br>Islamic and Muslim culture I learned a<br>lot and I especially got to work with<br>what Muslim woman I want to share that<br>with you and what that means to me and<br>what they're also helped me to do I've<br>been in corporate I was in corporate for<br>my first ten years of my life in<br>Auckland I was in<br>marketing and advertising I had no woman<br>leaders I had all non Malik parkia me<br>who actually taught me the skills that I<br>have today so i have to thank those men<br>who really believed in me and said<br>Rachel you can do it you can do it go<br>for it so I got to the end of my career<br>in ponsonby in Auckland and I had a<br>really good grounding of what corporate<br>was in advertising and marketing and<br>then I had the privilege of going to<br>London through my husband might have my<br>tanya is John he's not out of hunger and<br>more near North taller so he's my<br>trouble coruña Dallas who maybe is very<br>much the men who has supported me he<br>hates of like this you want and I do a<br>lot of keynote speaking I do a lot of<br>events and you know he'll only be there<br>when I absolutely ask you to he's not<br>like me but that's why it works so today<br>like everyone else I want to acknowledge<br>all of our speakers because I think it's<br>quite nice that I can wrap it up because<br>everyone has had their journey and<br>that's what we're on talk to whoever he<br>denying a today or Molly tin ore or an<br>addict kima Tahoe<br>and I am loving it I mean I did Molly<br>and every doll comment and aaron aaron<br>tveit 2006-7 for internally but i didn't<br>appreciate I did not appreciate what my<br>idea what means to me and it means so<br>much to see now and I understand now the<br>toner that I haven't you would like to<br>do and so I met night school on a Monday<br>niceville on the wednesday i go to<br>normal i was Stacey and Scotty and I did<br>wonder that I know we just recently but<br>is it is so important all the audio and<br>understanding it and it's and what I'm<br>really loving is in my night school I've<br>got non-maori there I've got Vietnamese<br>park here japanese ya want to understand<br>the audio so that takes us to a new<br>level so what I want to do and I know we<br>want to have some part I and I really<br>events that i go to we you don't get to<br>ask christians i get a but you know for<br>hard that i'm going to run through and<br>then you can ask questions number one<br>for me it was about identity so I grew<br>up as an urban Maori but my parents keep<br>me very grounded and two into my body so<br>we were always at magna Peggy par-4 poke<br>I we always were in the kitchen it<br>didn't matter yeah I knew where I belong<br>so for now at hahnemann aki tunga<br>Kotahitanga wider wattana rangatiratanga<br>i learned that as a young girl and I had<br>a very much as a balance in terms of<br>where I was in Oakland and West Auckland<br>so very proud of and my Maori side<br>especially with my dad at magnet a new<br>path again my role models I had mini<br>which I'm so grateful for most of them<br>are woman yeah my nan wasn't it in<br>Tucker she was part of the nope up to<br>that that put together why and that all<br>poop that took us to our settlement she<br>was part of that initial talker and if I<br>can be just one was in what she stood<br>for she is the type of woman that I am<br>am looking to so my question to you is<br>who are your role models yeah and<br>sometimes we don't have them in our<br>Father sometimes we don't have them an<br>hour a week but look to your role models<br>find role models that you were spire to<br>if you don't have them in your ear but<br>they are so important and what she stuck<br>she's taught me is to stand up for what<br>you know is right and I know throughout<br>my career with it being corporate and<br>now as being a business owner for nearly<br>10 years this is what has really held me<br>in the place that I needed to be to be<br>strong I was able to live in thrive in<br>London yeah I got to try lots of<br>different jobs but I rebound myself in<br>human resources so I knew I wanted to<br>develop talent I knew I wanted to<br>develop people so I had the opportunity<br>to work in big corporates Barclays<br>compass group and I built my<br>professional life in HR I then decided<br>that I wanted to do it for myself yeah I<br>was tired working fathers and so I<br>slipped up and step out of my comfort<br>zone and I started my own business and<br>it was just before a little bit before<br>as around 2005 so I've been in this<br>entrepreneurial world that's business<br>world for nearly 10 years now and what I<br>want to see as I want to see more Maori<br>in this place I want to hear us talking<br>about entrepreneurship yeah it's not<br>enough of that and just last week I was<br>in victoria university with the business<br>students the Maori business students and<br>Wow their idea<br>amazing but then the next step is how do<br>I do it how do I take that next step and<br>the great thing today in coming back 15<br>years later is that the doors are so<br>much wider so much more open than they<br>were when I was here for Marty women<br>going into leadership roles going into<br>governance with a Vee or corporate yep<br>they're looking for you or young Marty<br>students scholarships yeah you have to<br>be able to access those they are there<br>for you today they weren't there when we<br>were here so there's a lot of positives<br>and what and how we've moved in terms of<br>corporate I was able to tap take<br>implicitly first Mardi values into<br>corporate world because guess what<br>that's what they're looking for today<br>those values that typically sat on the<br>wall of corporate trust integrity<br>teamwork they never used to lean<br>anything so I was able to go into<br>corporate and look at transformational<br>culture project management and program<br>management so how do you take a an<br>organization through C values but they<br>don't connect with them so they were to<br>do some of that work I was also able to<br>work with ginger and diversity which<br>became my passion how to get more women<br>into leadership corporate and bordering<br>Rolf went really well so I continued on<br>and so that took me to the Middle East<br>and then I don't really know how to<br>explain it other than I felt like I<br>belonged to their culture I felt like I<br>could have been one of them I still have<br>a bit of an affinity and they you need<br>to go back there because they were so<br>open they wanted to know more about<br>Martin and if you look at this structure<br>it's<br>much around can you turn so they have a<br>ruling family all of their and we'll<br>talk about qatar and in particular cafe<br>has a population of 2.1 million of that<br>300,000 are cuddly yeah other talented<br>fina world and so everyone else are<br>expats like me and so they are<br>struggling at the moment with the big<br>culture change that is coming and being<br>able to retain their culture so I was<br>able to go in with a Mardi perspective I<br>went in with everything to do with<br>phenomena I meant everything to do with<br>monarchy toner and they have raced it<br>like you would not imagine I was able to<br>work with the government's and some of<br>the biggest organizations there Qatar<br>Airways after telecom to help them to<br>embed their culture yes first and<br>foremost into the organization's and it<br>was mind-blowing I'd never felt that<br>before my whole 11 years in London my<br>whole time in New Zealand I'd never felt<br>this before and so what I know to be<br>true about this culture is that and how<br>I've been able to mirror and my business<br>is that we're all trying to get to that<br>place whether we're in business or<br>whether we are everything we want our<br>identity to live also in these<br>organizations yeah we have values how<br>does my organization helped me to to<br>live and breathe my values yeah what are<br>you going to do to make me feel welcome<br>to make me feel<br>to care for me to develop me if you go<br>to any of the organizations today that's<br>actually what they're looking for so<br>what I'd like you to think about is<br>investing in yourself and as and i'll<br>talk about an auntie of mine sometimes<br>we leave ourselves to last is woman we<br>look after women are key everyone else<br>and so I'd like to put a thought into<br>your mind which is sometimes we need to<br>take care of ourselves in order to take<br>care of many and to take care of others<br>so I've asked you to look at investing<br>in yourself going forward forward and<br>one of the things that I really picked<br>up on while I was living away was when I<br>left New Zealand I actually had very<br>fixed ways of thinking this is what is<br>this is what I do this is how it's going<br>to turn out and so I moved out and I<br>actually started to fall in my mindset<br>and my opportunities and the<br>possibilities so I studied this thing<br>called growth mindset and who is an<br>amazing woman called Carol Dweck and if<br>you haven't had a look at pockets called<br>mindset and she's from Stanford<br>University and she's done 20 years of<br>experience in ually grow our mindset<br>stretch our minds go for those goals set<br>goals go for it achieve it go for the<br>next one I'd really encourage you to do<br>that to have a look at that I won't go<br>into this one what I want to get into is<br>today we're here in 2015 and because I'm<br>in this talent space i'm always looking<br>what is what is the future look like so<br>i wanted to ask you are you stuck in<br>2015 or you're looking ahead to 2025<br>because that's what we need to be<br>looking at<br>the building leadership models and they<br>look very much different to what is<br>happening today so when we're looking at<br>2025 if you're looking at the top five<br>trends about what the future work looks<br>like you're looking at corporate number<br>one is new behaviors yeah so that's all<br>the stuff that I was talking about<br>around values creating a better culture<br>within an organization technology is<br>driving everything yeah as a business as<br>corporates your brand exists on on all<br>of these social media websites the<br>Miller maniglia millennial workforce<br>they're going to change the way that we<br>work yeah they are already changing you<br>the way that we work so by the time we<br>get to 2025 they will be predominantly<br>the population that is with us mobility<br>by 2025 we won't be having just one job<br>you will typically have five jobs and we<br>will work on multiple projects yeah we<br>will be so we need to be really agile we<br>need to understand about change and<br>globalization I no longer believe that<br>we can't connect globally with other<br>cultures indigenously as well so for me<br>geographically we might be here I'll<br>tear all but we have all of the<br>technologies to be able to connect<br>globally and that's how we need to be<br>thinking going forward the book actually<br>is the future work by Jacob Morgan very<br>interesting so the other thing I wanted<br>to really plant in your mind is this<br>concept around indigenous evolution it's<br>not revolution evolution and there's a<br>lot of things happening globally that<br>are looking at how indigenous people<br>trade with each other so for example<br>there's a new brand of honey and I know<br>that it's Lydia was there as well<br>american indians are now trading with<br>with moudy their indigenous like what<br>maple syrup yeah so there's this<br>international trade going on we're doing<br>it here in out here all we know our<br>indigenous resources but now we need to<br>look as I say globally how can we do<br>indigenous trade it's happening the<br>indigenous look yeah everyone seemed<br>Daniel Hayes that look that moldy look<br>is very much exportable at the moment<br>all of the big agencies are looking for<br>this look indigenous tip i am very<br>privileged to have just invested in a<br>technology business in the middle east<br>it's with a Mardi woman called Rhonda<br>height Rhonda's height started chemo<br>media here in New Zealand we've just<br>launched keyword middle east and it is<br>an amazing project it is a business she<br>knows her stuff she's been doing it for<br>15-20 years she started there in a BW on<br>one of the shareholders and the<br>indigenous economy if you read what's<br>going on at the moment the UNDP f just<br>released a economic report and I read<br>this we must recognize the importance<br>and the power of the cultural and<br>creative sectors as engines of<br>sustainable human development which is<br>exactly what Tina was talking about what<br>we have is what people want so something<br>that I just wanted to raise before I<br>sign off is that one of the reasons that<br>I went into having my own business<br>working with talent I then had a growth<br>spurt in terms of my learning and v3<br>international certification for coaching<br>and I believe that coaching especially<br>for women is that is an entrepreneurial<br>skill that you can acquire so I'm<br>bringing an international<br>qualification to alterra specifically<br>training 100 indigenous women so that<br>includes Marty Pacifica I have to look<br>after my husband and it also includes<br>asian and we've already had three big<br>organizations sign up yeah so we will<br>put and haven't been done before we will<br>put 100 women through this training by<br>2017 they will then have impact on 1000<br>women and girls by 2018 then we go to<br>2020 level and pay 10,000 2025 100,000<br>we've got multiple projects globally<br>with indigenous woman so watch out for<br>it it's coming before december and<br>lastly i just wanted to say what what<br>does success look for you look like for<br>you so if we are a woman and we're in<br>the middle we need to balance so much so<br>we need to choose yeah and how do we<br>balance this so we've got our career or<br>our business we've got our life and our<br>plan we've got tell Marty today Oh Marty<br>and then we've got that self development<br>side so think about what is going to<br>sustain you what you can manage what can<br>wait yeah phase things not everything<br>has to happen at once and I was very<br>much like Tina I was on a on a race<br>200-meter sprint I'm more of a marathon<br>runner now for sure yeah and this is<br>what my experience has allowed me to its<br>allowing me to dream bigger and I really<br>invite you to dream bigger yeah we're<br>only as limited as what our mind allows<br>us to be and it's allowed me to do a lot<br>of things globally so now I come to you<br>know what has is Julie taken me to it's<br>come to my purpose is to develop<br>purposeful leaders one leader a time<br>that then go on in and power meaning<br>yeah yeah and just my own personal<br> ok<br>is Ben here Carter naughty Cody kaha<br>kaha nahi day so I said especially with<br>my deal I start as a small seat yeah I<br>will grow to a very strong coding and<br>sharla that will create an abundant<br>forests yeah so that is me I want to<br>allow you to be able to ask questions to<br>all of our awesome panelists so thank<br>Wow<br>oh my my my thank you to all the<br>speakers and now is the chance to ask<br>some questions so you can ask them to<br>all the panelists which has someone in<br>questions yes Carly equal to man's I<br>apply thank you very much for sharing<br>was amazing cool it with us want to give<br>you what is pretty and overwhelmed and<br>gesture I had complications are set to<br>one of the other people asked and<br>teenage or so you talk about his<br>experiences of giving organizations and<br>holding my world what made you change it<br>to go into a demotion corporate he has<br>how the transition been going I like<br>this and I always looking for something<br>new it's a challenge myself but I also<br>recognize that there are always new<br>horizons with be pushing our agenda is<br>model and to create spectacles and going<br>into an energy company to be honest<br>there's not what I did after but see it<br>i thought tina and i'll go and give<br>myself some learning at the same time<br>and i'll go and that's what I can while<br>I'm there so that's the reason for me<br>being in contact is you know I thought<br>maybe I was the point of contact the<br>eyes of my political but I makes you<br>learning a lot in life its ups and downs<br>highs lows no matter what at the end of<br>us experience I think we've made a<br>difference you know I think we've made<br>the organization at least you know<br>before toxic offices and wealth making I<br>do in project energy because I hit the<br>ground ceiling and I wanted to be a GM<br>of Marty and weary organization and it's<br>very hard to do as a parent I leave<br>because unfortunately my father believes<br>i have variability within poor parka<br>been having 20 years experience working<br>at home and there's a reality and i can<br>tell you within six months of looking<br>for content people treated me<br>differently they suddenly felt that I i<br>buy new stuff and it was nothing I was<br>saying that I wasn't
