Category</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hi I'm Lauren donon and I'm a third year<br>doctoral student and the faculty of<br>education and Social Work and I'm<br>presenting on my thesis New Zealand<br>young carers speak i am going to sit<br>down because I'm seven months pregnant I<br>sent to get quite breathless so please<br>excuse that okay so today I'm going to<br>share with you how my thesis identified<br>an invisible population access their<br>voices and brought about change I want<br>to begin with a story when I was 14<br>years old my mum passed away and because<br>my dad was an international flight<br>attendant a lot of the time it was just<br>my older brother and I at home now my<br>brother has autism in an intellectual<br>disability so that meant a lot of the<br>time it was my responsibility to make<br>sure that he showered give her<br>medication and do the cooking back then<br>I thought that I was the only young<br>person carrying out this kind of role at<br>a young age so I never told anyone I was<br>really lonely it wasn't until a few<br>years ago that i stumbled across an<br>article and discovered i was a young<br>carer a young carer as a child or youth<br>aged up to 25 years providing<br>significant and ongoing support for<br>someone with a disability illness<br>substance misuse or who's elderly all of<br>a sudden I wasn't alone in fact I<br>learned that I was one of 40,000 18 to<br>24 year olds providing care in New<br>Zealand however this is the only<br>statistic that we have about young<br>carers are New Zealand furthermore<br>international literature says that most<br>young carers like myself are actually<br>younger than 18 years old so imagine how<br>many more of us there must be now we<br>don't know much in New Zealand but<br>international literature paints a<br>broader picture it shows that young<br>carers are an invisible population that<br>they experience fewer opportunities to<br>socialize lower educational achievement<br>and greater unemployment than their<br>peers and they<br>experience negative emotions such as<br>guilt anger and frustration but what do<br>we know in New Zealand there's no policy<br>no services in just four published<br>studies all of which point to the<br>importance of research into this<br>vulnerable and hidden population and<br>that's where my thesis comes in my<br>thesis asked the question what does it<br>mean to be a young carer in New Zealand<br>and aims together the experiences and<br>needs of young carers as told by the<br>young carers themselves the overarching<br>purpose of my thesis is to use young<br>carers voices to bring about policies<br>and services that will meet their needs<br>but how do you find an invisible<br>population I want you to think back to<br>where's wally and how hard he was to<br>find on the busy pages of those picture<br>books now imagine if Wally doesn't<br>actually realize that you're trying to<br>find him and how much more difficult<br>that might be the international<br>literature suggested that it was going<br>to be hard finding participants for my<br>research but it didn't offer any<br>creative ways to go about it so I began<br>my recruitment was fairly traditional<br>sampling methods such as posters but it<br>didn't take long for me to realize that<br>a title such as hey young carers wasn't<br>going to work because young carers<br>themselves didn't know that they were<br>young carers so I thought back to how I<br>learned that I was a young carer and<br>that was through reading an article and<br>I decided to make a video about my own<br>experience as a young carer and the hope<br>that young carers would see the video<br>self-identify and come forward to be<br>part of my research I used social media<br>and shared the video and like a snowball<br>building momentum the video is shared<br>and shared again until eventually I had<br>35 young carer participants now the four<br>new zealand studies point out the<br>importance of having a broad range of<br>young carers in your research my young<br>carers were diverse not only in their<br>genes<br>but in the age that they started caring<br>on average 10 years old and their<br>culture and in their location throughout<br>New Zealand they were further diverse<br>and the number of people they cared for<br>and who they cared for whether it was a<br>parent or a sibling and in the care need<br>of that person from alcohol misuse to<br>intellectual disability each young Kira<br>took part and one interview with me on a<br>one-on-one basis I recommended an hour<br>maximum per interview but interviews<br>often took up to two hours because young<br>carers told me this was the first time<br>that anyone had asked them about their<br>experience the key to my interviews was<br>young carers themselves defining what<br>was important to talk about within the<br>boundary of young caring so that I could<br>understand what young caring meant to<br>them I analyzed the interviews by<br>writing out or transcribing the 35<br>voices and then pulling out the key<br>themes the key similarities and<br>differences inherent in those interviews<br>and weaving those together to tell one<br>story my thesis of what it means to be a<br>young carer now I said at the beginning<br>of this presentation that I identified a<br>hidden population and access their<br>voices which I've covered so far but<br>then I said that the overarching purpose<br>was to use young carers voices to bring<br>about change so what have I done first<br>of all I'm going to share with you two<br>key findings and then i'll show you how<br>I've addressed policy and services my<br>first key finding were that young carers<br>felt but there were being both a child<br>and an adult they talked of having these<br>adult like roles such as injecting<br>morphine for their mother or changing<br>the grandparents nappies but they said<br>that when they went to appointments with<br>the icky recipient such as the GP they<br>were treated like a child and they<br>weren't given information they needed to<br>successfully carry out their Karen roles<br>just like the international literature<br>said that young carers experience<br>negative emotions so did the young<br>carers in my study feeling anger at<br>frustration at this dichotomy between<br>being an<br>and being a child however they said they<br>truly valued the young caring roles for<br>the bond it created with the icky<br>recipient who may actually not have a<br>lot of time left young heroes were very<br>clear on their need for information<br>about the care recipients disability or<br>illness for training and how to carry<br>out their care tasks and for direction<br>where to go when they weren't coping a<br>second key finding was young carers<br>having fewer opportunities to socialize<br>which directly aligns with the<br>international literature however young<br>carers in my study spoke of it in terms<br>of a loss of freedom compared to their<br>peers which extended to their dating<br>lives which were practically<br>non-existent just as I felt lonely so<br>did the young carers in my study<br>speaking of a sense of isolation but<br>they also pointed out that they gained a<br>sense of maturity that their peers never<br>gained they said that they needed a<br>pause the chance to take a break and do<br>normal child or teenage activities and<br>they desperately wanted to meet other<br>young carers so what did I do with my<br>findings at the service level together<br>with Kara's New Zealand i created a<br>nonprofit organization called Yonkers<br>New Zealand now we're just in our<br>infancy but already we have a Facebook<br>page with over 2,000 likes and an<br>advisory group made up of young carers<br>so they have an ongoing voice beyond my<br>thesis and matters that concern them in<br>the future we'll have counselling<br>respite and socialising opportunities at<br>the policy level I work together with<br>the Ministry of Social Development to<br>come up with the first piece of young<br>carry legislation and I wrote an<br>evidence brief about the needs of young<br>carers to inform future policy decision<br>making internationally the voices of New<br>Zealand young carers can now be added to<br>the international conversation going on<br>about young caring but furthermore I've<br>shown how creative methodology can help<br>other countries to excess young carers<br>such as the US and Canada<br>want you to think back to the beginning<br>of this presentation where I told you<br>that I felt lonely and isolated and my<br>caring role can you imagine if there had<br>have been services available so I could<br>have met other young carers had some<br>training and understood that I wasn't<br>the only one how different my life has<br>been then within the scope of a PhD<br>thesis I'm obviously limited by time and<br>funding so imagine what can be done<br>outside the scope of a PhD all I can say<br>is watch this space because you're about<br>to see a whole lot more young carers who<br>are no longer hidden and no longer<br>are there any questions at all yes so<br>yeah this is done one I think it's very<br>pretty so you obviously very young I<br>think it's really good idea to see other<br>people's perspectives in the word from<br>challenging situations but I've also be<br>very curious to see what the results<br>would be when you pick non-caring young<br>people in there ever times and actually<br>if you can pick up their other groups in<br>society that also feel the same way<br>whenever actually the curious have on<br>straights and positives that they gave<br>this fun just wondering hmm because<br>until you actually have is sick on<br>responses from<br>hmm that you know the fact that they're<br>akira that makes their responses<br>certainly so that's something i don't<br>know maybe it's it's an interesting<br>point i think any research you choose a<br>methodology that will support the kind<br>of research you're carrying out so the<br>methodology that i chose is more about<br>just accessing the group you're<br>interested in in their particular voices<br>I think because young caring is so<br>hidden and this is some of the first<br>research being done it's really<br>important that the first thing we do is<br>access the young carers voices because<br>they're not being heard but in the<br>future there's such a huge opportunity<br>to extend this research wider not only<br>to compare it to non-caring groups for<br>instance but to do some quantitative<br>research and learn more about the<br>numbers of young carers to learn about<br>caring within specific cultural groups<br>which came through as a big finding in<br>my research that that different cultural<br>groups look at young caring differently<br>so you're absolutely right there's a lot<br>more work to be done in within my little<br>thesis this is what I've done so far but<br>thank you I appreciate your feedback you<br>mentioned that their intensity for more<br>unemployment which<br>switch I guess build the skills that<br>employers looking for but I was<br>wondering if possibly there was some way<br>to maybe develop the skills that they<br>gained yeah nvm Chaeronea maybe help yes<br>yeah that's a great point it took me a<br>lot longer to get to than one<br>presentation what Yonkers New Zealand<br>would love to do is to implement some of<br>the things that have happened in<br>Australia and the UK where young carers<br>may have to leave school early or they<br>may not be able to attend university but<br>they're gaining these incredible<br>capacities along the way that if<br>utilized correctly could result in and<br>you know being wonderful employer<br>employees and so having training<br>programs or certification to identify<br>the skills that they do have so that<br>when the day comes that they're caring<br>role ends for whatever reason whether<br>that is the end of their key recipients<br>life will they enter a rest home or a<br>hospital that the young carer isn't left<br>with a CV that says they dropped out of<br>school at a young age and did nothing so<br>definitely looking at how we address<br>that is really important the young care<br>is often the literature shows get into<br>jobs in the caring profession so it's<br>also important to balance that they have<br>a choice about their job because they<br>may not want to spend their life as a<br>carer but it just happens to be what<br>they're good at so it's providing those<br>training opportunities but balancing<br>that with opportunities to be something<br>else as well if that's what they desire<br>so you think it's something it could be<br>the policy level you know I know same<br>with design you might be able to say oh<br>you know I have this amount of<br>experience but they might enter a higher<br>level of study as opposed to if they<br>didn't have any prior experience or<br>anything this is something that can be<br>addressed yes absolutely and I think an<br>instance of something that's been done<br>in Australia recently as they implement<br>ooh the bursary for young carers so that<br>where their family was struggling to<br>maintain school fees or uniforms and<br>higher education that they can apply for<br>a bursary so just financially supporting<br>them so I think there's a lot that can<br>be done at the policy level to help<br>young carers to stay in education and<br>have those opportunities not and imagine<br>if you're a family who's not from New<br>Zealand I mean for my young carers where<br>their families were safe from the<br>Pacific Islands and the young carer was<br>the only family member who spoke English<br>it's in our responsibility to access the<br>services and and how can you expect a<br>young person to not only know where to<br>go but but what to say and to be taken<br>seriously so that's a real key of<br>services coming to families rather than<br>the other way around where families have<br>to go out and try and find services yes<br>absolutely and the Ministry commissioned<br>me to do the evidence brief on young<br>carers needs which was fantastic but<br>that was more directed towards the<br>information needs of young carers and it<br>would be good if we could go a bit wider<br>now to look at the other needs of young<br>carers and wider again to the needs of<br>their families so the support so far</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
