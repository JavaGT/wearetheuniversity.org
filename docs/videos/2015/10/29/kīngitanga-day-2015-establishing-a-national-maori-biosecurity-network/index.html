my<br>heart and my picky my tonight we're<br>Bruce in our quick Kevin thank you all<br>for inviting me here to speak in them of<br>course there's Bruce said I first met<br>him through the biological heritage<br>National Science challenge and and I'm<br>inspired and ordered by his work and his<br>commitment to see I'll maldi and to<br>developing multi capability in science<br>so thank you for inviting us and and we<br>love coming up north where it's much<br>warmer than where we are both Amanda and<br>I are North Island maldi who happened to<br>be residing down south so it's always<br>nice to get back up to home so my name<br>is Marnie moksha bolt I am of Nazi Party<br>naughty Kahuna news yatzee yatzee Ottawa<br>and nutty otoko a descent so i said i am<br>north island moldy i have lived in<br>canterbury for a very very long time my<br>father's ex-army so i was born and we do<br>and when he went to the Middle East to<br>work and the Sultan Special Forces he<br>dragged us back down to Christchurch so<br>that mum could be by her finally so my<br>mum's Irish Scottish so Irish Catholic<br>Irish Catholic Marty makes a really nice<br>combination and so I've been a crush it<br>for a very long time and as Bruce said I<br>work at the buy protection Research<br>Center alongside Amanda back my<br>colleague and I manage the Marty theme<br>there or the Marty buy protection unit<br>in its program but before that I worked<br>for tutoring or later who initially in<br>communications but then I moved into the<br>education team where I was till I see<br>for later his education subsidiary to<br>top away whatever so that's a bit about<br>me fortunate enough that Amanda's in the<br>country for once so given that Amanda is<br>real the real lead behind their muddy by<br>a security network I thought I'd drag<br>her along and and she'll you want to<br>introduce yourself and then you'll add<br>boring<br>how<br>so what we're going to talk about<br>briefly today is we're going to<br>introduce you to our team then sit a bit<br>of the biosecurity context around how we<br>got to establishing this muddy or how we<br>propose to establish doesn't National<br>Marty by security network we're going to<br>talk a wee bit about vm and particularly<br>how how it's relevant to faculties like<br>yours and why we believe more<br>researchers especially non multi should<br>be considering it and understanding it<br>and trying to engage with Maori end or<br>embed vision motto longer into their<br>research programs and then if we've got<br>time will briefly talk about how we<br>personally we've motto rangamati vm and<br>multi researchers into projects with a<br>couple of examples up there and we may<br>just touch on briefly after having a<br>talk to Kevin how we try and engage<br>multi students and to science amanda is<br>the multi lecturer and our science<br>faculty so if we've got time we might<br>just touch on that so this is the<br>research team for the biosecurity<br>network it's not our only it's not the<br>whole research team we have amend<br>obviously Nick quite putter whom many<br>people know Nick is originally from one<br>of no notice I found out from growing<br>older I found out today but is from<br>a tiny area it's where I'm into first me<br>some and he works for Auckland Council<br>neck i think is probably a multi<br>researcher who's worked for the most see<br>our eyes around or fever another full<br>Wilcox has just moved from sion to the<br>University of Otago and of course myself<br>but I wanted to mention that our wider<br>team includes full lava from lankier<br>Simon Lambert from Lincoln University as<br>well Jamie idea from Lincoln University<br>Sean Ogilvie who is with course running<br>as an independent consultant Kieran<br>Arthur is a nap we research based data<br>at plant and food auckland and we have<br>three multi master students and pacific<br>island masters students and a handful of<br>other multi researchers who feed and<br>when they can and when required<br>one of the interesting things that we<br>quickly cottoned onto and the buyer<br>protection Center has it's really hard<br>to get Marty staff full time and the<br>science faculties or into the buy<br>protection Center so what we did and<br>we'll talk about it later as well as we<br>established a research associates team<br>and we committed to committing funds to<br>point one point two of Marty researchers<br>so most Marty researchers refuse to come<br>work for us full-time they've got too<br>many other projects going on that they<br>don't want to give up but they all said<br>you know 4.1 or point2 or a wee bit of<br>spending money here and there will<br>access to students and we could<br>definitely commits some time so we have<br>quite a large Marty research team but we<br>only have them in bits and pieces by<br>security challenges in New Zealand this<br>is probably nothing new to most of you<br>sitting in here given we're in our<br>science faculty but you knew zealand has<br>you know a unique by security issue and<br>that is that with this little island<br>situate at the bottom of the world<br>susceptible to lots and lots of<br>incursions and pests and we don't know<br>how they'll react when they get here we<br>don't know what they'll do was there not<br>very good at planning for them and we<br>prefer to respond to incursions than<br>prepare for those incursions so one of<br>the interesting things that you know we<br>were looking at was how multi contribute<br>to biosecurity incursions and this<br>research project came off the back of<br>our involvement with Cody dieback and<br>with the tongue at affinia little piece<br>specifically so we're constantly under<br>attack from pests and we have about<br>estimated about 6500 interceptions at<br>the border every year and of course we<br>know that that's going to increase worth<br>growing trade and ports population and<br>potentially climate change it's about 30<br>to 40 actual incursions a year that we<br>have to deal with<br>so we have biosecurity is a number one<br>priority for the Minister of Primary<br>Industries it's also as it sees up there<br>for the fifth year in a row still the<br>number one priority for industry leaders<br>so we know that biosecurity is at the<br>forefront of people's minds in New<br>Zealand everyday citizens are conscious<br>of five security issues and incursions<br>they may not be to the level that we<br>want them to but most people understand<br>what by security is interesting that<br>that's not the case around the world i<br>was on a teleconference to sweden on<br>tuesday night and it was very different<br>over there by security wasn't something<br>that people thought about and you would<br>think in europe it would be huge given<br>the amount of borders they have but New<br>Zealanders are very aware in our<br>industry leaders are about the cost of<br>incursions and hence it's still a number<br>one priority NP I have obviously just<br>committed to reviewing the framework and<br>Amanda and neck on the multi focus group<br>for that review or rewrite how'd it turn<br>what's right but key inclusion points<br>not much to see here except for that<br>will note and the next title reg rate it<br>that most of our key incursion points<br>are ports that are surrounded by urban<br>environments for example auckland in<br>Auckland is an interesting case study<br>for us it'll be where we do a lot of our<br>multi by security network but it's also<br>we're the scion project that I'm a good<br>time to talk about later is based<br>because when you have incursions in<br>urban areas obviously you have all these<br>other social factors that you have to<br>consider and those are how the public<br>perceive what you're doing in terms of<br>your response and increasingly in New<br>Zealand we see a reluctance of<br>communities to participate in the puter<br>to participate in the kinds of<br>eradication techniques that we use so we<br>think back to the dc-10 spraying<br>Auckland City and door Hamilton and the<br>public are increasingly aware of what's<br>happening wanting to be involved and not<br>wanting specific tools to be used<br>auckland of course is our largest city<br>so most diverse and the work and grey<br>lynn were on fruit flyers of interest to<br>us and that quite but I one of our team<br>members was highly involved in it but of<br>course that area of Auckland or South<br>Auckland is low socio-economic<br>predominantly mardian Pacific island and<br>so we need to understand whether that<br>hinders incursions or whether that could<br>some examples of urban incursions and of<br>course there are other incursions as<br>well and you can read those the<br>understand is that of course painted<br>Airport moth which was lauded as very<br>successful also brought the most<br>controversy because you know whole city<br>was being sprayed from a big plane asian<br>gypsy moths of course was one moth that<br>they sprayed a whole city again so those<br>two incursions or eradication<br>particularly have shaped the way the<br>public and New Zealand perceive our<br>responses and it's also shaped the way<br>that Marty will respond and the future<br>of course we've got other incursions<br>that you'll all know about like pitch<br>canker fungus which is ions favorite one<br>PSA and kiwi fruit which I meant is<br>doing a better work on all of them we<br>know are costing or potentially will<br>cost New Zealand huge amounts of money<br>PSA I think the estimated cost will cost<br>us about 885 million over 15 years so<br>there's a real you no need for us to<br>look at new tools and new ways of<br>managing our incursions and what I'm<br>particularly interested in a social<br>scientist is how we can get our<br>communities engaged in that how we can<br>empower our communities to help and<br>specifically multi you want anything<br>Amanda<br>as the part of that comes out of this<br>legacy of research so you know Marty are<br>cautious about engaging with researchers<br>cautious about engaging with research<br>institutes even more so about engaging<br>with agencies like MPI but by and large<br>the New Zealand population is as well<br>when it comes to specific responses to<br>biosecurity issues like the spraying but<br>also you know we saw in grey Len people<br>not responding very well to quarantine<br>so you know you can't tell me I can't<br>take my groceries in and out of the zone<br>and in fact you know that's still under<br>quarantine so we're really interested in<br>how how urban communities but also how<br>traditional Maori communities respond<br>and what they see is some of the legacy<br>issues so that we can then find these<br>more socially acceptable approaches for<br>consultation before the next big<br>incursion hurts and of course some of<br>the questions for us will be around what<br>do you think about spraying over why<br>heat up who cites you know over our<br>secret sites what do we think about<br>spraying making akai sites so all those<br>issues like Amanda seed issues that are<br>quite shocked he actually had the<br>answers for that just never been asked<br>and they don't have a place where they<br>can discuss that and this is just a<br>generic slide just to show that it's<br>still on the agenda of the government<br>there's 2013 so a couple of years ago<br>but the Auditor General looked at mpi<br>and looked at how they were performing<br>and she was quite critical there are a<br>couple of responses there but<br>essentially what came out of the report<br>was a need for huge workforce planning<br>and capability development and they were<br>asking do we have the appropriate people<br>with the right skills in the right<br>places to respond and how do we empower<br>our local communities to respond and<br>that comes probably to the heart of what<br>we're trying to do for Marty is find a<br>way for Marty to feed into that response<br>in a way that empowers them because we<br>believe that we do have the right people<br>with the right skills and the right<br>places to do so so the National Marty<br>biosecurity network<br>right<br>and you can see after this up there and<br>oh and we'll make these slides available<br>later if anyone wants them and one of<br>the quiz one of the key things for us in<br>the biosecurity networkers as well as<br>everything a mentor said as how do our<br>kite sake mobilize themselves to respond<br>so one of the interesting comments that<br>came out of the Auditor General's report<br>was that this comes out a new ipod up<br>from Auckland Council as well as that<br>are the contractors MPI using the best<br>contractors out there do they give us<br>best value for money are they doing what<br>we expect them to do are they sharing<br>information etc etc and there are some<br>concerns around that and the order to<br>general acknowledged that that maybe we<br>could be getting better value for money<br>so for the multi by security network it<br>might be and we're not saying it is but<br>it might be about how do we mobilize so<br>that Marty can be some of those<br>contractors that go out and respond to<br>incursions the purpose again cantare arm<br>continued we can see up there is about<br>bringing together moldy and we had this<br>discussion with them with b3 if you're<br>familiar with better border by security<br>the group the other day we are they<br>asked us f if they could be a partner<br>we'd also had MPI at our door asking to<br>be part of it Ministry of Environment to<br>me it to me anyone you can think of as<br>been to visit and we keep reiterating<br>that this network is for multi and it's<br>developed by molding formality and when<br>we're ready we may engage government<br>agencies but right now what we want to<br>hear is what do our mighty communities<br>think about by security what are their<br>priorities and how do we discuss it in<br>an environment that's safe for us and<br>we're not really interested in how we<br>can help the government initially and<br>we're not really interested in how the<br>government can get access to our people<br>and our knowledge so we keep reiterating<br>and we will always reiterate that this<br>is a multi network for Marty developed<br>if you know Mandy you'll know that<br>that's very hard to be that polite the<br>next steps for us regional heater and<br>Bruce will be very familiar with us from<br>national size challenge match the<br>current landscape that seems to be<br>favorite terminology 4mb at the moment<br>how can you met the landscape we've<br>funded that we have no idea what we fund<br>it so one of our tasks is to go out and<br>see what projects are happening what<br>people are happening but for us the<br>focus will be on the community we want<br>to know what our communities are doing<br>in this space look at a gaps analysis<br>but also look at what's worked and you<br>know what's working well and then as a<br>we know there to let us know if you want<br>to attend a Hui and one of the original<br>the regional who are going to be pretty<br>broad and open to a lot of people when<br>we go to phase 2 into the y no no at all<br>will shrink it and and it'll be because<br>we want to develop some research<br>priorities and we want to look at what<br>programs we want to lobby for in the<br>first instance and as we formalize the<br>network that will be part of what we do<br>is look to network funding so how do we<br>keep this organization going long term<br>rather than just the interim two years<br>that we managed to secure funding for<br>and what research do we want to apply<br>so that's our by security network I want<br>you to touch briefly on the m policy as<br>you'll see up there it's a ten-year-old<br>policy now and Amanda and I were<br>fortunate enough to be at a meeting last<br>week within be where we discuss this and<br>and I think they got the message very<br>clearly from the 30 to 40 Marty<br>researchers are in the room that most<br>Marty think the vm policy kind of needed<br>to be put in the bin but at the moment<br>it is the policy there in B fund<br>according to so they use it for their<br>funding assessments most people here<br>know what V is and you're pretty<br>familiar with it the woods up there yeah<br>Martha dying are the words up there at<br>that it's a platform to connect Marty to<br>the science system give strategic<br>directions and guides and viscera is not<br>my language that's in bees language I<br>wouldn't necessarily agree with that but<br>that's what they were hoping to get out<br>of it whether it's done that or not as<br>yep<br>we<br>we'll catch up afterwards oh yeah yeah<br>and it's a really good point that you<br>know we're trying to keep it independent<br>I mean our institution would love to<br>hold it an institution jumped on the<br>bandwagon and said you know great you<br>know good job little girls give us the<br>money and make share it and we've had<br>people knocking on the door offering to<br>fund it but we've held them all at bay<br>and said no don't fund it because we<br>actually don't want to lose it and<br>dependence so you know when we take off<br>our research and Institute in it and put<br>on our Marty hat we know that its<br>strength lies and being independent from<br>those organizations the other issue we<br>have with mpi and doctors that they've<br>hit that both had their budgets cut<br>quite substantially and so there's stuff<br>that they probably can't do either so<br>it's really it's really important for us<br>that we find a way of mobilizing<br>ourselves and and then feeding into them<br>and maybe we can help change some of<br>their systems and some of the ways they<br>behave<br>so again I just wanted to check this up<br>there to remind you and like most of<br>seed you up you're familiar with vision<br>motto tongue and this is obviously it's<br>four things again these words come from<br>envy from our Hawaii where Amanda not me<br>I won't have much to steal it stole a<br>document that told us what healthy vm<br>looked like and and this was also there<br>so this was what they would they try and<br>they try and tell us what you know if<br>you've got a research project that does<br>some of these things and it's considered<br>healthy vision Martha donor and you'll<br>potentially get funding what we see is<br>no consistency from from out what I've<br>seen in terms of you know my time and<br>science research management there's no<br>consistency and how vm is applied so<br>some projects get really good kudos for<br>having lots and lots of vm in it and you<br>know when you get your fight year report<br>back you'll find out like some of the<br>projects will talk about later that<br>you've got funded because of how good<br>your vm stuff was but then other<br>projects get through whether you know<br>one line saying doesn't apply to us so<br>just doesn't seem to be consistent i<br>guess the only the light i see at the<br>end of the tunnel is a bit of mobility<br>in the multi research space where Marty<br>researchers are starting to hand my mb<br>now and say we want consistency or we're<br>the why it's worth but what the<br>government have done and that just put<br>so that said we're not saying you<br>shouldn't include my petting a moldy or<br>multi researchers in your research or<br>your funding applications what we think<br>you should do is be mindful that Mata<br>Dona Modi is very different to vision<br>multi-donor and that you can include<br>Marty researchers without having to<br>alter what you want to do in your<br>projects you know to significantly and a<br>couple of examples very briefly before<br>we run out of time are of course you<br>know the biological here it has<br>challenged that Bruce got off the ground<br>and running and did a fantastic job and<br>he did a fantastic job for us as Marty<br>because he included us right from the<br>outset so right from the moment it began<br>and from the moment the initial<br>discussions started and the writing<br>groups were established there were moldy<br>at the table and we were listened to and<br>not just placate it and you can see that<br>the structure that we developed for the<br>biological heritage challenge supports<br>multi at all levels and so the numbers<br>are you know one in six governors is a<br>Marty Rick we're working at the moment<br>to try and increase that and we've got a<br>working group with the governance group<br>and our cargo a multi on how we can go<br>for a partnership model so hopefully one<br>day we might get to a 36 or more the<br>science Leadership Group 5 out of the 11<br>members on the science Leadership Group<br>almaty the advisory group the car who is<br>one of three advisory groups challenge<br>partners at the moment include two<br>denominator who although why castleton<br>know he had initially put the name on<br>the list but I don't think it made it<br>through to our actual application but<br>there are other Marty challenge partners<br>who are coming on board and because we<br>were fearful that if we did the complete<br>integrated model of Marty research we<br>may lose our multi research we've gone<br>for three standalone vm projects but<br>every project every research project<br>their teen off has to have a vm<br>component to get funded so right through<br>the structure a multi-donor moldy vm<br>specifically the policy are reiterated<br>and everyone has to consider it think<br>about it and they have to work with a<br>kotatsu to see how they can integrate<br>Marty knowledge or Marty research with a<br>lot of students into the approach act<br>amended the coyote so you may want to<br>so we wanted the broad protection<br>research centers I've been there since<br>2008 and amenda probably about the same<br>not long after was one of the models<br>that we look to when we developed the<br>biological heritage National Science<br>challenge and again for me it's about<br>structure so how do we ensure that Mario<br>represented every level of the<br>institution or the organization so that<br>we have a voice and so that we can make<br>sure that our concerns are heard and<br>that we've always got someone at the<br>table lobbying for us because at the end<br>of the day the fastest way to exclude us<br>is to not have us at the table<br>especially when when money has been<br>discussed if there's no resourcing for<br>formality than nothing's going to happen<br>so the buyer protection Research Center<br>when it began in 2003 was quite<br>innovative and that it developed a<br>standalone multi research theme and I<br>think I've written I've taken note to<br>you aliso to the editor lacrosse Express<br>Christ is quite redneck but at the time<br>seed and new Pandora's box has been<br>opened allowing Marty interests to<br>handle a gitam at scientific research<br>and technical progress so at the time it<br>was really controversial how dare you<br>know a serious research institute like<br>the what we called at the time national<br>center for advanced biotech biological<br>technologies dedicate resources and a<br>whole research theme to moldy you know<br>there's no such thing as multi bio<br>protection there's no such thing as you<br>know whatever whatever we were trying to<br>research they basically you know<br>dismissed up but at the end of the day<br>it had no resourcing so I didn't go<br>anywhere so while it was lovely on paper<br>and a you know attracted commentary at<br>the paper and actually didn't do<br>anything for years because there was no<br>money in there was no genuine commitment<br>to Marty and so over the last couple of<br>years we've restructured the center so<br>that moldy do have representation at all<br>levels and so that we do have<br>significant funding to develop and as<br>you'll see there we have multi champions<br>which are the same as clay hotel and the<br>National Science challenge and their<br>role is to drive Marty research in that<br>particular theme but to work with the<br>non Marty researchers and that theme to<br>get them up to speed as well to support<br>them so that they can and go<br>with Molly and so that they can think<br>about what we need when they're<br>developing their research projects do we<br>think it's a perfect model no is there<br>enough money for Marty and the buyer<br>protection Center still no but are we<br>getting there I think we're getting<br>there faster than lots of other<br>certainly jumping with Christians and<br>then the last project we want to talk<br>about briefly was scions new mb project<br>and again this project has quite a heavy<br>vm component in it and that's because<br>they included multi right from the<br>beginning so before they even looked at<br>who would potentially be the research<br>and Scion made a commitment to having a<br>really strong vision Martha dong as they<br>called it section within this mb budge<br>and not just in the social science<br>sector so in our 1.3 understanding<br>communities which is obviously where I<br>sit as a social scientist but in all the<br>areas so acknowledging that moldy aren't<br>just interested in the fluffy social<br>science stuff that I do as my boss calls<br>it but in the real science like Amanda<br>does and you know and like you all do so<br>Marty are interested and you know active<br>surveillance you know the tools that<br>have been developed we want to we want<br>to participate in the development of<br>those tools to see whether they are<br>going to meet the needs of our<br>communities whether there's an interest<br>for our organizations to commercialize<br>you know Marty organizations are just as<br>interested in innovation as non Marty<br>organizations so this research project<br>has three of its five main researchers<br>are moldy so again a huge commitment and<br>quite a big chunk of the budget so we're<br>quite excited about this one hopefully<br>if it all pans out your night research<br>institutes in life we get out prettier<br>then we'll be very happy because it is<br>about the urban side of incursions but<br>it's also about understanding what Marty<br>wants so it feeds them really nicely<br>like everything we do back into our by<br>security network feel free to ask<br>questions because in the end you know<br>other than like we see on the bottom<br>line other than your treaty commitment<br>to moldy there are other reasons for<br>including Marty and your research<br>projects trying to engage with the<br>communities and that is that I'm a<br>member of the Mardi Council so we don't<br>have any money unlike a we but when I<br>worked for he always constantly knocking<br>on people are still saying you know I<br>work for NATO here we've got you know<br>a lot of money you should be engaging<br>with us and so II we are growing and<br>they are via the back seat they are<br>increasingly interested in conservation<br>resource management you know at Oak Park<br>is interested in energy and and the like<br>so we need to be mindful of that when we<br>develop our science projects but also we<br>have a growing interest as kevin was<br>telling us and Marty studying science<br>and moldy gonna to Sheree and education<br>and as we set up there Marty entering<br>tissue education at twice the rate of<br>fire and especially in Christchurch we<br>see that because most people can get a<br>job on a rebuild somewhere but we see<br>increasingly in large amounts of Maori<br>choosing to not into the rebuild and to<br>go to university instead so there are<br>many reasons why you should engage with<br>Marty there are many ways of doing it<br>and I just don't know if I men don't<br>want to touch on some of the ways we do<br>we<br>so yeah I told joy I don't enjoy<br>engaging<br>and so the other thing I'd add is that<br>Lincoln we've been fortunate enough to<br>have a multi major approved for our<br>bachelor of science and that hopefully<br>kicks off next year and part of that is<br>about incorporating obviously<br>traditional knowledge and to the science<br>degree but about offering a bit of<br>familiarity for our multi students<br>sitting in a science class so that will<br>be using just the basics of using the<br>relevant adult in the class that applies<br>to science or applies to environmental<br>studies not realistic 18 history which<br>is what Marty students tend to get when<br>they go to university they get the whole<br>you know history of the treaty and<br>everybody activists in the world that<br>stuff that they've already been taught<br>at home or probably learnt at school of<br>the cutter but focusing on the history<br>that are specific to science in the<br>history that are specific to<br>conservation management and to mere for<br>us and life science is a big deal<br>because we're we only have a very small<br>multi department at Lincoln and so we're<br>hoping that that will not only attract<br>multi students but for us we have a huge<br>amount of international students that<br>will create a bit more of a witness of<br>engaging with indigenous people around<br>the world and of course the benefits of<br>that and how that can increase your<br>project and viability as well we would<br>say but its reach as well its community<br>reach so Monte Ohio was a man then I<br>worked alongside for many many years and<br>and most of you will have heard this but<br>he was very well known for saying that<br>what's good for Marty is good for<br>everyone what's good for everyone's not<br>necessarily good for Marty and of course<br>that's the philosophy we use when we<br>design our Marty outreach projects and<br>also our curriculum we almost there<br>using our own people and you know next<br>year will be my son hopefully or the<br>year after and and the labs and the<br>classes is a bit of guinea pigs so we<br>know that if we can engage them then we<br>can probably engage the masses but um<br>you know Marty students are fussy so if<br>we can't engage them and we're going to<br>bore everyone for bubbly so any<br>I'll cure tokoto thank you for listening<br>thank you for your time up Vera our<br>emails and our Twitter handles if you<br>want to contact us and thank you for</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
