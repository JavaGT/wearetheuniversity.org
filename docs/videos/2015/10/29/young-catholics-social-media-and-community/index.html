Nicholas Thompson we have<br>a 30 day money back guarantee of the<br>supplement get a life are you tired of<br>comparing how strong your eyebrow gamers<br>to everyone online do you get sick of<br>Instagram in today get a life will for<br>sure help you get a life perhaps you can<br>tell that sometimes I get frustrated<br>with the way social media is used<br>sometimes so that's why for my honors<br>dissertation and theology I decided to<br>combine my passion of working with young<br>people belonging to church community and<br>being frustrated with pointless online<br>exports I'm focusing on young Catholic<br>Aucklanders experience of social media<br>and how consistent this is with a<br>Catholic understanding of Christian<br>community this compares positive and<br>negative aspects are belonging to these<br>two types of communities motivations<br>young people have and belonging to<br>church and in using social media and how<br>these overlap or a bit cut off there and<br>so why is this important it's important<br>because my generation is the first to<br>use social media extensively and I'm<br>ultimately trying to find some kind of<br>answer to what young adults seek and<br>obtain and belonging to community<br>although I may be focusing on Catholics<br>and navigating online and reality with<br>religious belief I argue that finding<br>acceptance and belonging or what all<br>young people seek especially in a time<br>when you'll constantly put pushed to<br>portray yourself in certain ways online<br>so how am I going to do all this what<br>I'm doing is a branch of practical<br>contextual theology and this is applying<br>theology in everyday situations Steven<br>Bevins offers this basic praxis model<br>the EC up here which is based on<br>reflection and action and is rooted in<br>the experience of the people so the<br>first step is describing the experience<br>of young people the second is completing<br>a context analysis by dialoguing with<br>non theological literature the third is<br>dialoguing with tradition in Scripture<br>and the fourth is making a critical<br>reflection based on these previous steps<br>then conclusions are offered in<br>practical ways of looking ahead to the<br>future so trust me theology is not such<br>a waste of time as many people may think<br>so too the context analysis there are<br>three key things that came up and there<br>and they were identity connectedness and<br>narcissism which I can never spell row<br>identity is significant as young people<br>who have different social networks<br>online and offline meaning that self<br>presentation is a critical balancing act<br>Pearson Bob Cousy come from a<br>sociological standpoint and they say<br>that social medias uses in more secular<br>countries refrain from expressing<br>religious identity due to fear of<br>judgement or starting debates<br>connectedness is significant as some<br>authors argue that a pseudo spirituality<br>can be found in Blowing to online<br>community in a study of youth on social<br>media and China also found that social<br>media can satisfy needs of affiliation<br>and times of distress finally there are<br>different kinds of narcissism found<br>online and social media can bring out<br>narcissistic tendencies among us and can<br>reward those who are clinical<br>narcissists like this fine looking dog<br>up here this results in a tension from a<br>variety of superficial relationships and<br>highly managed presentation of self so<br>just to remind you where we're at the<br>next step is dialoguing with tradition<br>and scripture and the field data which<br>I've been collecting so I've been<br>carrying out anonymous questionnaires<br>and different Catholic parishes around<br>Auckland after Sunday Mass for sixteen<br>to thirty three year olds now I don't<br>have any Whitaker's chocolate here like<br>I gave to the participants but if you'd<br>like to participate in activity then I<br>would really appreciate it so I'm going<br>to ask you two questions and if you say<br>yes please stand up where you are and if<br>no then just stay seated and give me<br>your wave okay so the first question is<br>do you think people become more popular<br>in reality if they continually post<br>yeah okay question number two is there a<br>difference between posting a photo you<br>took of yourself like a selfie and a<br>photo which someone else took of you is<br>there a difference between posting a<br>selfie and a photo which someone else<br>took of you you're following the trends<br>it's great okay so those are two of the<br>less personal questions that I did in my<br>question in and in the last two months i<br>collected 327 responses and I could have<br>got more if the Ethics Committee hurried<br>up and it gave me a response so the two<br>theologians I'm using our Pope Francis<br>and Jean Vanier and the scripture<br>scripture passage I'm using is the Good<br>Samaritan from the Gospel of Luke so in<br>Francis visited Cuba last month he said<br>I would dare to say that at the root of<br>so many contemporary situations is a<br>kind of radical loneliness that so many<br>people live in today running after the<br>latest fared alike and followers on any<br>kind of those social networks and in<br>other places he says that online<br>connections shouldn't prevent meaningful<br>relationships it's in accepting oneself<br>and acting out of interest to form<br>meaningful relationships rather than<br>building out one's personal reputation<br>which leads to acceptance of others so<br>can everybody copy me so imagine it but<br>a hundred times louder and that's our<br>mental some Catholics are about Pope<br>Francis so for one year community is how<br>to suffer with others in their joys and<br>sorrows so at the same time you grow in<br>love for oneself and God by not avoiding<br>your own brokenness or pretending to be<br>someone that you're not only when you're<br>able to accept who you are that you are<br>unconditionally loved by God for who you<br>are what's it Francis discusses the Good<br>Samaritan from Scripture which I argue<br>underpins both theologians comments so<br>Jesus says that we should love God and<br>neighbor as we love ourselves so someone<br>asked Jesus who is my neighbor so Jesus<br>tells this story after two priests<br>passed by a severely injured man<br>Samaritan stopped and cleared for him<br>Francis emphasizes a culture of<br>encounter on the digital highway he<br>concludes that the church community is<br>it cool to deliver a flood of religious<br>messages but to listen and to help<br>others find meaning in their lives<br>that's what these in mind of the data my<br>two hypotheses i will make to use my<br>critical analysis are frequent church<br>attendees are less likely to post<br>content about themselves on social media<br>for personal popularity gain and they<br>find the balance between social media<br>and faith communities so just to give<br>you a bit of context and the 16 to 33<br>year old age bracket the bulk of sunday<br>mass cars are 16 to 23 year-olds and a<br>predominantly asian or pacific islanders<br>were some europeans and a smattering of<br>other ethnicities the older ones usually<br>either leave christianity or together<br>will go to a Pentecostal church and they<br>may return to get married and want their<br>children baptized most of the time<br>genuinely and others just to get into<br>the Catholic education system so there<br>were three groups of questions in my<br>survey and the first was church the<br>second was social media and the third<br>was how these overlap so in the first<br>section one of the funny responses for<br>negative experiences of church was mate<br>there's too much praying yes there is<br>too much praying other than that<br>one-third of respondents wrote about<br>judgment from others in the church<br>hypocrisy and not understanding the<br>scripture as you'd hope the positives<br>far outweigh the negatives with ninety<br>percent writing about finding profound<br>peace and feeling loved and supported by<br>the community and God in the second<br>section on social media it's<br>predominantly used to keep connected<br>with friends and family but about<br>three-quarters of respondents wrote<br>about huge judgment from others and<br>bullying others also wrote about being<br>annoyed at others who post too much one<br>said some people actually post really<br>interesting things others post<br>sandwiches sandwiches with their faces<br>next to them<br>so in the third section the slightly<br>unexpected trends so far is on the<br>question does your faith affect your<br>actions on social media there's a closer<br>distinction between yes and no with<br>about sixty-five percent yes and<br>thirty-five percent know those who<br>aren't said yes right that faith is a<br>guideline and all aspects of life but<br>some of us who say that they don't want<br>to post to achieve things as a lot of<br>people judge them for it and look down<br>on them especially here in New Zealand<br>those that answer no right that social<br>media is completely separate from faith<br>and that their faith is too strong so<br>interpretation of the question is<br>different now we're at the final stage<br>of the methodology the praxis so I'm<br>still analyzing the data but it will<br>include recommendations for the church<br>leaders and individuals so this will be<br>something like deleting or restricting<br>access of social media friends who don't<br>really mean anything to you be involved<br>in church activities to develop a sense<br>of fulfillment and belonging and when<br>you meet up with your friends put your<br>phones in the middle of the table and<br>don't check them and sometimes priests<br>need to include in their comments better<br>relationships and social media and their<br>sermons generally churchgoers tend to<br>already have a strong sense of<br>self-worth with the belief that they are<br>loved and created in the image of God<br>thus my praxis is not so much helping<br>people with self-esteem issues but how<br>to make social media meaningful and a<br>way to enhance real-life relationships<br>so yes the study is for my own research<br>but I hope that this will voice the<br>opinions of young adults in the church<br>and be useful in real local parish<br>situations as I hope to present this<br>research back to them ultimately as Pope<br>Francis's may the light we bring to<br>others not be the result of cosmetics or<br>special effects but of our being loving<br>neighbors to those wounded and left on<br>the side of the road so let's all go get<br>and yourself or so I let them write<br>whatever they wanted to write and it<br>took me as taken me about two weeks just<br>to categorize all those answers and I'm<br>not really useful you I don't really use<br>Excel that much so I took me ages so<br>luckily my parents are accountants yep<br>the lonely young people were differences<br>within the Pacific island responses uh<br>yeah I would say so and I think the<br>Pacific Islanders they tend that they<br>didn't really write as many negative<br>things about the church just because I<br>think it's so entwined with the culture<br>and again when I say Asian I mean I know<br>it's a really broad category and that<br>would include people who are considered<br>themselves Indian and Filipino Indians<br>and Filipinos they're like no I'm not<br>asian I'm Indian or Filipino so that's<br>probably the difference that I'd say but<br>yeah<br>yep pretty interesting correlation<br>between someone's religious and collect<br>they are likely to post selfies on<br>facebook and and whether or not that<br>actually implies that they are you know<br>they are very happy with himself they<br>feel very confident place in society<br>whatever it is I'm curious how that fits<br>into your research it's this idea of<br>i'll sell my days hmm um summer I think<br>maybe about twenty percent of<br>respondents right about that self-worth<br>kind of thing and felt that they were<br>comparing their lives to other people<br>because they weren't sort of happy about<br>themselves so when I say the majority of<br>people let kind of their mostly happy<br>with themselves and people did write<br>about they wanted to share positivity<br>whether it was not necessarily about<br>their Catholic faith or their Christian<br>faith but positivity to like share that<br>so that was sort of the general message<br>that people wanted to share and so that<br>did come into it here but definitely<br>there were some people that felt that<br>they were comparing their lives to each<br>other or how strong the eyebrow game was<br>yeah</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
