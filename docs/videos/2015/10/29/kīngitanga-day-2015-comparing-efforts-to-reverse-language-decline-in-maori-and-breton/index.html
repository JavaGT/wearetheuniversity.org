Jennings<br>I've presented several times 15 young a<br>day in the past this times a little bit<br>different because I'm presenting someone<br>else's work master students mine grade<br>and Bryant Braden comes from Northland<br>he's studying Maori French and<br>linguistics with an emphasis on language<br>policy on top of that he's lived in<br>France he's lived in western France and<br>Brittany so he's perfectly qualified to<br>undertake the research however his<br>partner was due to go into labor the day<br>before yesterday so I am presenting him<br>Ravens work he's got other things on his<br>mind but we're going to be looking at<br>this in three aspects first of all the<br>background information to decline then<br>the efforts to reverse the decline to<br>revitalize the language and finally<br>issues beyond just the language into<br>culture and identity Britain is spoken<br>in the western Peninsula of the width in<br>Brittany par de France you might think<br>these days you'd be right i think these<br>days everyone in france speaks French<br>but historically that wasn't the case<br>was a huge range of languages spoken in<br>France up until probably the mid 20th<br>century when many of them started to<br>fail since everyone's very keen on<br>talking about flags at the moment there<br>are some exciting flags up their efforts<br>on<br>regions you've got to know if you've got<br>a flag like that that's Corsica you<br>don't mess with the course of chemists<br>their brain power so we've got something<br>ideas for our offending than air breton<br>is a Celtic language it's very very<br>close to Welch in fact Welsh people and<br>Britain's can communicate without having<br>to pass through English or French<br>Britain was spoken by a majority of<br>people in the region until the late<br>1800s and it was then that the French<br>government brought in free and<br>compulsory primary education throughout<br>the country right step forward to<br>literacy obviously but that education<br>was only in French which meant that kids<br>all over the country speaking various<br>regional languages but not speaking<br>French ended up learning the language<br>through this school but of course there<br>was had an effect on their their native<br>languages there were I mean it was very<br>strictly French in the education system<br>so they were well documented cases of<br>punishments for speaking your native<br>language so the regional language is not<br>just in Brittany but across France and<br>of course you find some parallels with<br>other places as well now in the first<br>half of the 20th century and the years<br>in between the two world wars in<br>particular were marked by a very strong<br>shift of way from regional languages in<br>France towards the the national language<br>French and in the space of three<br>generations regional<br>languages order disappeared it went from<br>the grandparents who spoke only that<br>language to their children who were<br>brought up in the regional language it<br>were brought up and bred on but went to<br>school in French and then when there was<br>a shift towards the cities there was<br>migration away from the countryside<br>towards the cities they ended up working<br>in French as well and those that that<br>generation made the decision to bring up<br>their children in french at the time<br>they believed that it was you know the<br>the Breton was the language of the past<br>French was the language of the future<br>was the language of success would enable<br>their children to succeed in life so<br>they made the conscious decision to<br>switch consequence of that was about<br>1970s it seemed that Britain was going<br>to die out but there was a cultural<br>Renaissance was many many cultures<br>around the world and danger of being in<br>danger of becoming extinct the Britons<br>were particularly inspired by cases in<br>the Basque Country in Wales and French<br>Canada but of course there were other<br>places also concerned other people's<br>concerned about the loss of their<br>language an association of great on<br>parents opened the first d1 school d 1<br>means seed germinate sprout in and Brett<br>on the first Total Immersion preschool<br>and bred on opened in<br>nineteen seventy-seven head led to many<br>more today there are see the emphasis on<br>the preschool primary schools or 41 d 12<br>schools 6 middle schools and one high<br>school it starts off as Total Immersion<br>as the kids go through the system they<br>get more and more French more and more<br>French language because when they get to<br>the end of high school they're required<br>to sit their national exams in French<br>but at the preschool level it's entirely<br>in French in Brett I'm sorry so they're<br>really working on the immersion it<br>wasn't straight forward for the parents<br>who first set up these schools because<br>the french constitution states quite<br>clearly right near the top the language<br>of the Republic is French there are very<br>important historical reasons for that to<br>do the French Revolution and trying to<br>unify the nation but what it means is<br>the French government isn't really that<br>keen on funding emotions thoughts so the<br>the parents started working on state<br>schools and the private schools and in<br>the mid-1980s have Brett on the various<br>options of Britain began in those scores<br>sometimes it was just a few hours a week<br>like three or four hours a week so<br>instead of learning Spanish or German<br>you might learn great on at other times<br>it was maybe two or three times that<br>much so there's a lot of variation and<br>the number of hours offered in those<br>schools but the results look pretty<br>impressive would you like to see a nice<br>graph like that for situation here and<br>the top of the graph the top line that's<br>the total the reg<br>is the d1 schools they've labeled off<br>someone that you can see that the state<br>schools in green and the private schools<br>in yellow now there are lots and lots of<br>children in Brittany now studying bread<br>on and it's going up quite sharply so<br>there's there's very positive growth<br>there as they're putting a lot of money<br>into it mentioned at the moment however<br>is obviously more to saving the language<br>than just stalling a TV station was<br>launched in 2001 in had a lot of great<br>on language content but that declined<br>fairly quickly for funding reasons since<br>2010 there's been there's no Brett on<br>available on that channel but if you<br>like Murder She Wrote or Colombo or<br>other reruns from the 1970s and 1980s<br>that's the place to go the internet this<br>Britain presence on the internet and<br>other minority languages are working on<br>this as well with a you know you've got<br>a YouTube channel in your particular<br>language the thing is people are less<br>inclined to watch it because they have<br>to go and look for it it's not the same<br>as just sitting there flipping through<br>the channels and you know a channel in<br>the region alone which comes up you<br>actually have to go and look for it<br>there's a radio presence but it's fairly<br>small slightly a few hours of community<br>radio be the equivalent and Western<br>Brittany you will see street signs in<br>the efforts to reverse decline in<br>Brittany have been what they thought I'm<br>going to be encouraged by a new article<br>in the french constitution which<br>basically recognized regional languages<br>as a dharna but again the French<br>government is more token recognition and<br>actually putting money into it however<br>France has been decentralizing more and<br>more since the 1990s they've been<br>sending more central government money to<br>the regions and its really now the<br>regions that are driving the efforts to<br>save the local languages and Brett on is<br>by far the strongest in this respect in<br>France so it's not the central<br>government that's going to save those<br>languages it's now the region's another<br>as you beyond the the classroom and<br>funding the issues of identity Britain's<br>a French first and they the exception of<br>very very few people they will identify<br>first as French and then as Britain and<br>when they talk about being bred on it<br>refers to living in that region rather<br>than a strong attachment to the culture<br>and strong identification with the<br>language one of the reasons for that is<br>that there are very few cultural spaces<br>for the language there are a few<br>festivals there are the occasional<br>occasional Britain festival there's the<br>there are intercalated festivals as well<br>but the focus for breath on seems to be<br>on the classroom now that makes the very<br>attractive-looking graphs as just seen<br>but that's not the whole story<br>culturally in France there's a greater<br>that could be a problem school was much<br>more it has much more of an academic<br>focus even from from lower levels and<br>that can be a problem when you know you<br>try to get kids to take the language<br>home with them to involve the parents<br>then there are issues of shame like a<br>lot of regional languages in France<br>those languages were associated with<br>it's not you know as and the speakers<br>would still be able to speakers still<br>shame they talk about being embarrassed<br>if their mothers will call out another<br>law out to the kids dinner time we'll<br>pull up in the original language gives<br>you feel embarrassed and that shames<br>still lingers there's one more issue a<br>big issue in a number of regional<br>languages in France the problem of<br>diabetes Britain has four dialects one<br>of them is quite distinctive so if<br>you're producing teaching resources or<br>TV programs what are you going to do if<br>you haven't got the funding to produce<br>the resources and the different dialects<br>you have to compromise and they've<br>compromised but the elders say well<br>that's not great on and not only do you<br>have to compromise you have to modernize<br>as well because you have to invent new<br>terms if you're trying to teach<br>five-year-olds kraton you have to talk<br>about you know videos and YouTube and<br>who knows what that no the elders there<br>were no words like that so there's<br>there's a gap it's not just limited to<br>Britain as well but with the dialects on<br>top of the the modernization it does<br>cause problems now as I've been<br>discussing these points until you have<br>recognized some similarities with<br>situation here doodle Maori has similar<br>history of decline 19th century no the<br>schooling in the dominant language<br>punishments for speaking Maori the<br>switch in the from the 1930s 1960s the<br>switch from Margaret wingfish enhanced<br>by the move to the cities and of course<br>the revival attempts they will seem a<br>little familiar as well of course we've<br>got the d1 and Kohanga REO starting at<br>roughly the same time multi television<br>starting at roughly the same time only<br>that study has succeeded but despite the<br>similarities of history we get different<br>results on the left census figures up to<br>two thousand and six people identify as<br>Maori see very impressive growth curve<br>there but look at the enrollments in<br>dick wanna deal right at best you could<br>say it's stable but we're really looking<br>at gentle decline you put those two<br>together it suggests that the percentage<br>of the Maori speakers is declining<br>certainly for the future generations now<br>one thing Brayton pointed out very<br>strongly was differences in issues of<br>identity in particular general Mallory<br>has placed Brett on doesn't have a place<br>doesn't have the equivalent of them at I<br>a place where not only is the language<br>it's also the advantage here of having<br>national status rather than regional<br>status which helps for example for the<br>TV programming the funding behind that<br>there's the fact that kahunga do of<br>course you know they started on mer i<br>initially and the emphasis on fire on<br>you know on transmitting the language<br>and then outside the community across<br>all primary schools now you've got very<br>positive attitudes towards naughty<br>culture in the schools kapa haka ever<br>method iki multilanguage week and so on<br>all of those things great advantages<br>there's a lot of positive connotations<br>with the language here particularly with<br>new generations coming through so we've<br>got two very different pictures when you<br>look at how the other languages fearing<br>the conclusions of bread on years<br>there's lots of growth in the schools<br>but it just seems to be about sports<br>there doesn't seem to be anything<br>outside the community not even you know<br>really the emphasis on the families so<br>it's almost like they're teaching as an<br>academic subject and that's causing<br>serious issues for transmission of the<br>language because if you want a language<br>to survive it has to be able to be<br>transmitted not just to the next<br>generation back to the one after that<br>and it doesn't look very good for great<br>on despite that lovely figure that<br>lovely graph that there needs to be<br>creation of some sort of cultural space<br>where Britain has value there's not a<br>lot of that well it does help that's non<br>wind of wire up there one of France's<br>most popular singers she won the first<br>French idol I don't know about 10 or 15<br>years ago she's very proudly great on<br>one of her albums it's called blue tone<br>she doesn't speak the language but she<br>promotes it and she is a positive role<br>model for it because traditionally break<br>on singers are old sort of hippie<br>hyundais strumming a guitar or heart now<br>that's that's not going to appeal to 10<br>euros so unique you need a certain<br>youthful vitality portrayed in the<br>culture as well now Braden's conclusions<br>for situation here transmission to the<br>next generation is not assured the<br>numbers tho those because the Paul<br>starts with the Kohanga deal really and<br>those numbers not brilliant he talks<br>about the possibility that maybe there's<br>a little bit of complacency with the<br>enhanced visibility of little mouth that<br>maybe people are thinking well there's<br>been a lot of work down the cultural<br>regeneration look at things like the<br>matatini now it's really really big that<br>sort of things been achieved what about<br>the education and one final point<br>normalization it's fine on but I what<br>about outside in the community what<br>about in everyday situations and I've<br>been on this campus for a good few years<br>now in between lectures now it's pretty<br>busy place when you're walking backwards<br>and forwards on those paths going from<br>one<br>to another and all the years I've been<br>here I've only twice her people speaking<br>Maori in that context you hear it on the<br>MER are you here to coffee but this<br>issue of normalization everyday<br>conversational language outside a multi<br>cultural context if you like just just<br>the everyday situation the language<br>needs to be normalized to enhance its<br>chances of continuation of transmission<br>to future generations you're not so for<br>example in Wales there the ISTEP 490<br>revitalizing in some way some of those<br>signage yes I have there's a lot of<br>cooperation between the Celtic revival<br>movements because they're all working<br>for the same sort of gold and I know<br>Brittany and why I was very close in<br>that respect so I don't know a whole lot<br>of that cooperation between the two but<br>they simply must have worked I mean that<br>they need every year the inter-cosmic<br>first of all so there must be a lot of<br>sharing of information they do have the<br>best nurse but again it's limited it's<br>not yeah it's ty dolla now it's<br>temporary I assume that report you to<br>see the right attire the local then just<br>Murray Thomas treated as differently<br>couldn't hear that thanks about Gaulish<br>basically Julius Caesar came along and<br>the Romans occupied golf or five<br>centuries and gradually the language of<br>the balls became what the ancestry<br>French and then in about the sixth or<br>seventh century when all the Vikings and<br>so on moved into England refugees fled<br>from southwestern England into Brittany<br>and that's where Britain comes from it's<br>actually as Cornish if you know that the<br>Cornish language so that they will rip<br>refugees that's an interesting word<br>called refugees and migrants but they<br>they were basically refugees or migrants<br>or whatever the term is fleeing<br>persecution and moving across the<br>channel that's why Brittany and Great<br>Britain as well have the same same<br>similar sounding name so there's a<br>different history and then gradually was<br>an independent kingdom for a thousand<br>years afterwards before became<br>calverton ugly and the people cope with<br>a horn or TR mike ma otha i completely<br>agree with you thank you very much for<br>your presentation the normalization is a<br>sexual that's what I'm talking about how<br>important is it to you for the Prime<br>Minister Bob the other words to be flown<br>yes look as a language teacher I think<br>it's important for people to speak<br>they've released quite a foreign<br>language and quite frankly the more than<br>area because it gives you a different<br>perspective on sense so yes it would be<br>nice to have someone who speak more than<br>um I think what they're using at a lot<br>of other places in Europe or trying it<br>is that with the European Union plus a<br>trend towards devolution the regions are<br>getting more and more strength more and<br>more power so it's all most likely<br>trying to go around the nation's go<br>around the national thing so you've got<br>places you know Catalunya in Spain where<br>where they're trying to say or the<br>basque country where yes they happen to<br>be part of spain but actually this<br>region in europe the brigands have been<br>trying this is the course against even<br>more so as you can see from that flag<br>you don't mess with it thank you very<br>much be prison understand presentation<br>as a geographer I found it really<br>interesting about in our place plays an<br>important role on strengthening language</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
