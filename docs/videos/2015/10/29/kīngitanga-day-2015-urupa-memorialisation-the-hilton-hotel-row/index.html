Judith McDonald here at the<br>University of Waikato has spoken about<br>the tikka pian beer all traditions we<br>are in they sleep and large big houses<br>and the living sleep on one side and on<br>the other side of the big house are they<br>so we can surmise that an hour Theodore<br>pre-contact Marty initially buried their<br>dead within close proximity to<br>settlements but as numbers grow<br>competition for limited resources<br>increased as did tribal conflicts and so<br>the bones of the deceased had to be<br>protected from others who would<br>deliberately desecrate them and so our<br>burial places such as the palace of babe<br>burial site which both part did and<br>sevens were preferred to does actually<br>evidence how we shifted dramatically<br>from common public space pay spaces<br>close to par settlements through secret<br>and concealed locations and there the<br>remains would rest undisturbed in a<br>highly restricted space intentionally<br>safe from visitation or de fallen a key<br>file well these concealed spaces<br>included caves which brings me to one of<br>the better-known New Zealand examples of<br>the miry island lake horrible k ethereal<br>discover discovered the fiordland's in<br>1967 and retinol extensively<br>particularly by simmons and the otago<br>museum records there are numerous<br>commentaries counts and images as well<br>as this pencil sketch by maureen or walk<br>however that is not a cave burial site<br>of my people but my people PL added to<br>employee do have them<br>catered for example on our tribal<br>leaders of mother fo de which like Mary<br>island as nestled in tribal waters late<br>1905 image on your left is somewhat<br>romanticized by blonde field the normal<br>painting of mutter photo with in lake<br>rotoiti while the image one you're right<br>is mutter phone at today Bloomfield<br>kinston can be seen to have taken some<br>artistic liberty that's here indonesian<br>capture my village there l homestead<br>thorns of another weird and 1905 and<br>judge instructed me about the cave<br>dwellings that are located in those<br>hills well tough all those in just one<br>moment well now of course Marty empower<br>her thought out to each a common rule in<br>New Zealand but that said caves were not<br>our only options on this case Marty you<br>did use specific trees particularly the<br>hallowed lens of the pretty d if you<br>like my google<br>but a couple of Buddha TV now I better<br>bring you cake and so the remains were<br>really well hidden in these trees which<br>of course trees last long time so my<br>thought they're safe we don't have to<br>worry about this micro a dead died in<br>2006 but in 2005 of course Matata had<br>the landslides so one of the first<br>things that he did was to read the<br>puppet army council users authority<br>considerable and instruct them that when<br>you find bones they are often the<br>symmetry there our people you must<br>retrieve them they must be returned to<br>which fortunately was the case and<br>before I shift into modernity i also<br>want to mention the use of vaca to pop<br>up goo practice by few tribes<br>archeological evidence suggests that<br>they were in use for 300 years Eileen<br>Fox wrote the commentary and catalog<br>referenced here and I don't want to get<br>caught up in this topic because my<br>people the other 12 we did not do or<br>could do parku but it is nonetheless<br>appropriate to mention I do however once<br>you use this moment to touch on beasts<br>words today Marty have adopted practices<br>that were initially prevalent only<br>amongst our noble and elite such as the<br>tummy hung a process and tire now if I<br>want to be emphasized as I did in my PhD<br>that with the good earth noble birth or<br>common all Mardi coexisted on long side<br>each other and so they either<br>participated witnessed or observed as<br>much regardless whether they were in<br>turn so treated and notably ensuring the<br>remain state undisturbed in<br>an enviable space was critical and<br>aspect then an earlier times as it is<br>today a contentious point which I'll<br>touch on presently so as I said mardian<br>party L thought to etch out a common<br>world in New Zealand and our people<br>necessarily adapted our tummy hunger<br>practices and up our traditions we see<br>star second period secondary burial<br>traditions all together by the late 19th<br>century we were solely and confining<br>ourselves to primary aerial processes<br>which brings me to Hanoi this is one of<br>several little path scattered throughout<br>my people's lands and to which we have<br>unencumbered access for my phone though<br>this is out contemporary burial location<br>it is not our only common or modern<br>buddha park there was another former<br>aerial site located back and beyond one<br>honey but this is our current goober and<br>has been for almost a century so good of<br>our our private party burial grounds<br>they are most often located adjacent to<br>par mud I and/or cleaner and nowadays<br>common to all lili but may I eerie<br>specific culturally defined sites there<br>cater to the members are specific early<br>interconnected by descent and shared<br>tribal affiliation and just as with Greg<br>arts in cemeteries where the past serve<br>to dispose of the d there are safe<br>spaces upon which we are increasingly<br>seeing the arrival of cremains there<br>fits spaces free from roaming and firing<br>burrowing animals then awful and they<br>are of course socially sanctioned<br>containment environments be there from<br>biomedical and more interesting lee<br>tamari other world contamination as well<br>I wrote in my doctorate that my people<br>are a sentimental people particularly<br>when it comes to our deeds so whilst put<br>a pastor of these purposes they notably<br>reflect well people it was al did are<br>gone nonetheless still here which is to<br>say that our guru par are significant<br>sites of memorial than more realization<br>with a living watch over we revisit we<br>reminisce and we even reengage with our<br>dead emotionally spiritually and some<br>would even argue physically and wherever<br>the three decades ago at blood to et-1<br>we will not as ostentatious or<br>extravagant without bupa memorials as it<br>appears that we are becoming today for<br>example the memorial headstones from my<br>great grandparents generation as simple<br>slab tents with biographical data and<br>ascribed leaders these are the<br>headstones of my great grandfather and<br>my great-grandmother they are succinctly<br>are monks the oldest here so that one we<br>there are a few older ones now these<br>tablets set up right on the ground the<br>old ones that down fled with even less<br>data on them it's quite interesting to<br>see and most importantly I thought by<br>fascinating they do not the older<br>tablets do not mention the names of the<br>living<br>they are sudden micro a dead it told me<br>that we never used to place the names of<br>the Living aside alongside those of the<br>dead this is echoed in my aunt's<br>interview and during my childhood this<br>was to some degree store being practiced<br>because during Tony Allen honey our<br>aunts and queers used to get us kids to<br>run around when flowers arrived and pull<br>out the cards we live in New why we just<br>told get the cards out now for those of<br>you who are mature enough you might<br>remember the first big bold that came<br>from florists and let would redeem it we<br>used to comment about can be flashed<br>well it all those lovely perspex holes<br>on the veranda thinking that out we have<br>put them there to make the Maho look<br>pretty it was because you couldn't get<br>into the perspex bowls so they weren't<br>permitted next to the body but it didn't<br>make the model pretty at the same time<br>so nonetheless change and adaptation are<br>now common in our theater and today<br>condolence cards with the names of the<br>living can be seen clearly propped up<br>half a century later we can see<br>consequences of the temporal<br>generational shift from the time period<br>of my great-grandparents headstones to<br>two examples here of their 12 children's<br>headstones my grandfather's which differ<br>to those of their appearance on the left<br>of my mother's biological father on the<br>right is his younger brother my my<br>now by this time we see the emergence of<br>colored mobile tablets we see floral in<br>patent borders with varying fonts<br>biographical data now includes the names<br>of deceased and living children and just<br>as noticeably we suddenly see the<br>emergence of photographic images of the<br>dead these could simply reflect<br>technological advancements and<br>stonemasonry that contributed to these<br>changes and of course the ones<br>incredibly expensive camera by the time<br>my grandfather's passed away had become<br>a common feature so perhaps that<br>contributed to hell photos appeared I've<br>been given the five minute can't you did<br>that usually killed<br>that brings me to the title of this<br>paper the Hilton Hotel row which<br>deliberately also has a play on the<br>notion of the Hilton Hotel Rao and to be<br>prudent to my phone oh now you tried to<br>give you discreet pictorial exemplar<br>it's a distinctive row of 10 headstones<br>and if you look at this roti and heads<br>those you will see our various sized<br>hearts open books stairways together<br>teardrops you'll see monolithic when<br>they have known my mother and when my<br>mother's family were successfully short<br>people ah she said it's bigger than she<br>was in life poss be outdone when our<br>mother passed away she gets selected her<br>own and of course she taken the best of<br>the singular ones &amp; mugeez one has the<br>angel holding that so that's the altar<br>hotel rome i think at this point i've<br>used a few minutes to speak briefly to<br>the changes in adaptation and this isn't<br>the only new end and innovative activity<br>unfolding it Mardi little paw during my<br>PhD my chief supervisor normally at yoga<br>cortico reminded me of the new things<br>going inside the caskets including iPods<br>mobile phones which initially one<br>wouldn't challenge a mobile phone going<br>down until the olds pull you up and say<br>are the photos removed and people don't<br>think well no the photos of delivered us<br>will on the phone not good<br>to the old people the young people<br>caught him looking up so once again it<br>is indicating change in adaptation in<br>life a local council where her parents<br>wanted to put this in me I was here the<br>kidney 2014 early Connolly we would<br>never be there ostentatious and<br>extravagant i canta combos ounces that<br>we all play pens and lullabies for<br>hence I had to stop briefly and write<br>this paper speaking of which although we<br>don't put photos of the living with<br>idiot in 2014 and I was personally<br>assassinated to watch world wide<br>televised ation of the funeral casket<br>peaches geldof stunning what didn't work<br>out with you naked look at those<br>pictures I rushed home to my olds and<br>they would it dear look at them we're<br>living husband who living children and<br>even who living dogs aren't Lee some<br>controversy to our people wrapping up<br>now very quickly aired and touching very<br>briefly on the fact that you know this<br>is Tommy Hunter this is it about<br>controversy body we do this well<br>particularly in matters of death one<br>need but mentioned the ongoing like a<br>morir case similar to the occurrence<br>ability James to pacu the roving remains<br>of Honi Hickey in fact there are perhaps<br>a surprising number of controversial<br>cases as well as some stunning academic<br>work including a beautiful paper that I<br>refer to in my PhD by dr. Cole mica here<br>at this university I mentioned these<br>soldiers exemplars of controversy they<br>are not the purpose of this paper they<br>simply reflect the concerns of our<br>people to ensure the remains of our dead<br>stay undisturbed and in violent or maybe<br>your dupe are simply example as<br>exemplars of a much bigger picture where<br>the Armada is being in as an integrating<br>us pics of economics and technology<br>raises several other questions in<br>conclusion as I see that the outset this<br>remains a working paper which is<br>currently being peer-reviewed with a esa<br>oh cool<br>it's imposing questions about buddha bar<br>I have to admit as any fully fledged and<br>accomplished academic I've answered<br>three questions and raised 30 questions<br>in a wonderful leagues or sighs I thank<br>you for spending this time interesting<br>presentation particularly found it<br>interesting about the mobile phones of<br>the photos going into the casket I would<br>never have thought that people would do<br>that putting photos and enhanced it and<br>on behalf of the university I would like<br>to thank you and the organising<br>organizers of connecting ER and does<br>anybody will just take a couple of<br>minutes for questions we're running a<br>little overtime so does anybody have any<br>questions I've just got one it's a<br>working paper cremation because Marty<br>good we just a bunch of this beer<br>anything anybody killed in the food<br>that's a good one in an alternate<br>conferences we encountered the question<br>of remains one of the stories that we<br>have with the research team my colleague<br>Bridget they recount the story being<br>told that weird one how one of our<br>people his wife passed away in Australia<br>haddock remains ready he bought her home<br>when they arrived at the mud I the<br>guijarro we were utterly stupefied<br>because they were expecting a casket now<br>becomes this urn not only that he never<br>entered it he couldn't let her go so it<br>travels back and forth between Australia<br>and New Zealand how are we dealing with<br>it as is a typical of Marty we roll with<br>it we have no Co couple that we know<br>that we have no think I'm gonna cover<br>except to respect the right of the dead<br>and the wishes of the living it's an<br>ominous we are learning this we also<br>know that graveyards and cemeteries of<br>full power are fully filling it's now<br>becoming common for people to ask to be<br>cremated in order to one stop the<br>expense of the international<br>transportation home so that they can<br>store be bought oh and so well if<br>there's no place that they would apart<br>just sprinkle me on top of mum I'll be<br>right so we have no cover would you come<br>accept that and which we are adapting in</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
