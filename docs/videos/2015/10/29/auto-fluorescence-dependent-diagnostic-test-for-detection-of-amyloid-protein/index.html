generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hi everyone my name is Maggie Pandya and<br>I'm a biomedical odden honours student<br>this year there's a pleasure for me to<br>present in front of you a very hot topic<br>in research today so ignoring the title<br>of my project here let me see how many<br>of you can guess what health is your<br>issue I'm talking about today so what<br>what comes to your mind when you when I<br>say the following things say memory loss<br>confusion forgetfulness mood swings I<br>bet we're all thinking of that one<br>friend who still owes us money right<br>I mean forgetfulness confusion Suns just<br>about right or it could just be signs of<br>old age right but how many of you<br>thought of Alzheimer disease as a<br>diagnosis after listening to those<br>symptoms<br>not many I bet oh we are the judges as<br>Imus disease is something that occurs in<br>the latest stage of life but these<br>symptoms precede and are the basis of<br>diagnosis as of today currently sensory<br>loss has been researched lately in<br>Alzheimer disease where vision and<br>hearing has been affected me personally<br>I'm interested in vision problems in<br>Alzheimer disease so I'll be looking in<br>ocular biomarkers related to Alzheimer's<br>disease and how they cause original<br>pathologies sounds like a mouthful but<br>what I'm pretty much investigating is<br>whether the same pathology that occurs<br>in the brain occurs in the retina as<br>well affecting vision currently they're<br>53,000 New Zealanders diagnosed with<br>Alzheimer's disease and this number is<br>expected to rise at a very alarming rate<br>it is costing us millions of dollars in<br>pharmaceutical needs caregiver programs<br>hospital visits etc we need to act and<br>act fast but where do we begin there are<br>two molecular aspects of Alzheimer<br>disease one amyloid pathology to tau<br>hyper phosphorylation me personally I'm<br>interested in the amyloid pathology so<br>within the brain cells there is the<br>transmembrane protein called amyloid<br>precursor protein or a P P for short<br>which is involved in synaptic function<br>ion regulation hormonal release etc it<br>is vague<br>related by betta secret enzymes in gamma<br>secretase enzymes which ultimately leads<br>to one by-product called beta-amyloid<br>peptide which is known to be toxic<br>better amyloid leads to cell loss<br>information oxidation even vision<br>problems all leading ultimately to<br>Alzheimer's disease sure is better<br>amyloid the bad guy here the one causing<br>Alzheimer's disease well the answer lies<br>within the structure of this protein<br>there are many isomers of this protein<br>ranging from 36 to 43 amino acid long<br>but research shows that better amyloid<br>40 and better amyloid 42 are responsible<br>for Alzheimer's disease<br>the protein on its own has a random coil<br>shape but when the concentration of this<br>protein increases and within an area<br>their self assembled themselves into fib<br>roles and those furballs are known to<br>have better sheet formation<br>interestingly research shows that beta<br>sheets are related to autofluorescence<br>something that fluoresces when emitted<br>when excited with a specific spectrum of<br>light maybe we could exploit this<br>property of this protein this leads some<br>other hypotheses of my research using<br>auto fluorescence dependent diagnostic<br>test for detection of amyloid protein<br>great now we have a hypothesis but where<br>can we test this well how about the eyes<br>there are four reasons to why we should<br>look at eyes four alzhiemer's biomarkers<br>one because of the retinol in europe<br>with neuro neuronal and origin is the<br>same we suspect that retina expresses<br>the same enzymes and proteins involved<br>in the amyloid pathway also this<br>confirmed presence of better<br>m'lord within the retina and there has<br>been visual difficulties observed<br>between AD patients one study even goes<br>further to say that the retinal talks<br>precede the plaques and observed in the<br>brain in the transgenic mice model how<br>is this related to current theories well<br>currently there have been companies who<br>have invested large sums of money in<br>building equipments that detect<br>this so the image here shows curcumin<br>based labeling of better<br>m'lord within the retina curcumin is a<br>protein that is Auto fluorescent and<br>binds to beta-amyloid peptide but this<br>makes it an invasive diagnostic test<br>where the curcumin has to be injected to<br>reach the retina but if the better<br>amyloid peptide on its owners auto<br>fluorescent we would not need this and<br>it would become a non-invasive<br>diagnostic test which brings me to the<br>aims of my hypothesis is there presence<br>of better amyloid within the retina in<br>Alzheimer's patient if so is that Auto<br>fluorescent if so can we use this as a<br>diagnostic test I've used the transgenic<br>mice model to test the theory simply by<br>imaging tree treated tissue versus<br>untreated tissue my mass model includes<br>two major groups want the control which<br>are the wild-type animal to this<br>transgenic model which contains a human<br>a PPG and a ps1 mutation Pierce one<br>mutation occurs in the enzymes I've<br>mentioned earlier to increase the<br>production of beta amyloid peptide this<br>shows that shake sectioning of the<br>tissue which observe which we can see<br>the cornea and the anterior side and the<br>retina on the bottom which were<br>interested in retina is where the light<br>processing occurs<br>this image shows their layers of the<br>retina with photoreceptor layers on the<br>top that detect light ganglion cell<br>layer on the bottom which persists a<br>little this light into electrical<br>signals which are sent to the brain the<br>preliminary data comes from the Degas<br>model which is a naturally occurring of<br>zammis model which has the same<br>pathological and behavioral changes like<br>a human patient would the image here in<br>the blue stain is sustained by Dappy<br>which stains the cell nucleus as you can<br>see it is a pretty healthy retina the<br>image here shows autofluorescence in the<br>red channel these dots indicated here<br>are just natural tissue on its own<br>without any treatment<br>this image here shows the photo beaching<br>which is the next step so we were able<br>to crunch the photo the autofluorescence<br>using two hours of UV exposure then my<br>colleague who was able to label the same<br>tissue with 4g8 now thus 4g8 is an<br>antibody specific for better amyloid hmm<br>this pattern looks familiar if you look<br>at it the tree tissue before and after<br>has the similar staining pattern the<br>dots observed before are pretty much in<br>the same region observed after the 4g8<br>labeling that brings me to my mouse<br>model in my mouse model despite the fact<br>that there is high background<br>autofluorescence what we are interested<br>in are the dots here indicated by the<br>arrows compared to the Degas model my<br>mouse model has the dots appearing in<br>the outer nuclear layer which is just<br>photoreceptors which has photo Reserve<br>receptors present so the next step was<br>to photo bleach well there's bad news<br>because I wasn't able to completely<br>quench the for the autofluorescence even<br>despite two hours of UV and 30 minutes<br>of copper sulfate exposure so this led<br>to troubleshooting why is there high<br>auto fluorescence in my tissue this<br>could be because of the fixation and the<br>handling of the tissue before and after<br>so to overcome this I used confer comb<br>microscopy techniques to help me<br>distinguish between autofluorescence and<br>the signal just to mention to make this<br>study a little more interesting I was<br>blinded to the study and as I was<br>unaware of the state of the mouse to see<br>whether I was able to distinguish<br>between the wild type and the transgenic<br>so mouse a here is before before<br>treatment and this is after treatment as<br>you can see we see no dots appearing in<br>either of those staining x' which leads<br>me to believe that this Mouse was in<br>fact a wild-type<br>however in Mouse B we see the dotted<br>pattern before and after leading me to<br>believe that this is a transgenic Mouse<br>model mice also Mouse see has the same<br>path<br>and we can see by the circles that the<br>dots before and after co-localize and<br>they're found in the same region as<br>before this leads me to believe that in<br>fact that yes there is better amyloid<br>present and yes there is auto<br>fluorescence in the tissue and yes we<br>can detect this after revealing myself<br>to the state of the animals it was in<br>fact true that yes mouse a was wild-type<br>mouse B and C were both transgenic well<br>further studies I would like to do is we<br>have confirmed the presence of beta<br>amyloid now we want to see that<br>effective has on the tissue itself so<br>far on the timeline of Alzheimer's<br>vision has been a very hot topic of<br>discussion and I hope that my research<br>leads to a pre to an early diagnostic<br>test to decrease the incidence of<br>Alzheimer's all in all maybe we should<br>get that friend checked we may not get<br>our money back but at least we can save<br>a life thank you not yet but if we do<br>catch it early there is different things<br>you could do with lifestyle changes diet<br>changes in etc that have been X that are<br>under experiment at the moment that can<br>reduce the progression of the disease so<br>we can have a better quality of life and<br>maybe slightly longer life then in<br>normal as I make its patient would at<br>the moment yep<br>I do have more samples but as I was<br>running out of time I only had time to<br>put three in there but yes I do have<br>evidence from other samples to suggest<br>the same thing this is Vic that's a very<br>good question I'm glad you asked that<br>because this is before treatment and<br>this is after treatment so this requires<br>a lot of washing exposure to antibodies<br>and washing again and again which does<br>damage the morphology of the tissue so<br>the shape of it does change and<br>therefore we cannot say they come from<br>the exact same point yeah it's just the<br>processing of the tissue doesn't allow</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
