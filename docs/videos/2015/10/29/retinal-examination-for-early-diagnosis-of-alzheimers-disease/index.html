Alzheimer's obsession over<br>the coming years in 1906 the woman died<br>in her brain was sent away for post<br>mortem histological analysis and these<br>abnormal proteins were found adjacent to<br>the cells in the brain these proteins<br>were the amyloid plaques and<br>neurofibrillary tangles as illustrated<br>in this diagram and this is just a<br>normal healthy brain for comparison to<br>this day these proteins are still the<br>defining signs of Alzheimer's disease<br>now more than a century has passed and I<br>have both good news and bad news to<br>share the bad news is the clinical<br>diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease hasn't<br>changed all that much although nowadays<br>we have the luxury of technology such as<br>MRI and cerebral spinal fluid analysis<br>they are both highly invasive and very<br>expensive so the clinical diagnosis<br>relies heavily on patient symptoms<br>meaning that the disease is often only<br>diagnosed when significant damage and<br>the brain has already occurred and<br>perhaps this is why therapeutic<br>intervention hasn't been all that<br>successful the brain had simply lost its<br>reserve to regain function but don't be<br>disheartened the good news is there are<br>many researchers out there working<br>diligently on the topic to understand<br>the disease process and to achieve<br>better diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease<br>leading us to my PhD topic<br>window to the central nervous system<br>regional examination for the early<br>diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease and my<br>aims are firstly to determine whether<br>there are clinical ocular signs and<br>symptoms specific and Alzheimer's<br>patients and secondly to design an eye<br>examination for the early detection of<br>the disease now this may be a funny idea<br>strange idea to you but in fact<br>complaints related to vision are<br>actually among some for earlier symptoms<br>and Alzheimer's disease visual function<br>testing has revealed a deficit and<br>contrast sensitivity visual field defect<br>color vision abnormality etc the sensory<br>structure of the eye as the retina which<br>is the multi-layered structure lining<br>the back and the surface of the eyeball<br>if the end the most layer of the retina<br>forms the optic nerve which makes direct<br>connection to the brain now because of<br>this anatomical connection and close<br>embryological origins between the eyes<br>in the brain that makes you wonder<br>whether the eyes may act as window to<br>neurological conditions such as<br>Alzheimer's disease and in fact data<br>from my animal studies and from the<br>literature both confirmed that there are<br>Altimus associated proteins accumulating<br>in the retina this is an image taken<br>from my thesis and here we can see that<br>the abnormal protein are colored and<br>green and they are lying right they are<br>lying adjacent to the retinal cells<br>colored and blue and these proteins are<br>believed to lead to information<br>degeneration in regional sinning which<br>clinicians can detect now Hinton's group<br>in 1986 was actually one of the first to<br>detect degeneration at the level of the<br>retina and Alzheimer's disease this is a<br>post-mortem image of the retina in the<br>cross-section and approximately the<br>level of the red line and here we can<br>see in the control tissue where the<br>cells are nicely packed whereas in the<br>Alzheimer's samples the cells are<br>looking more sparse and spread out<br>suggesting cellular loss in regional<br>singing<br>now more recently clinicians are able to<br>detect regional thinning by means of<br>non-invasive imaging techniques such as<br>the optical coherence tomography or OCT<br>for short which i will explain in a<br>moment in this leadless to my PhD<br>hypothesis that there are structural and<br>functional changes and the retina of<br>Alzheimer's patients detectable through<br>non-invasive i tasting to investigate my<br>hypothesis a clinical pilot study was<br>designed to include 20 young controls 20<br>elderly control in 20 cases of confirmed<br>Alzheimer's disease during participant<br>recruitment individuals with no an eye<br>diseases or neurological conditions<br>other than Alzheimer's disease were<br>excluded people who fulfilled the<br>inclusion criteria under wind a<br>cognitive assessment as part of the<br>baseline measures each participant then<br>underwent a thorough examination<br>including the quantitative analysis of<br>the original anatomy and original<br>function now firstly retinal anatomy was<br>assessed by Oct which was mentioned<br>earlier the the principle of OCT is<br>similar to an ultrasound which gives you<br>the morphology in thickness profile of<br>the retina and interestingly an<br>Alzheimer's disease the retina is<br>significantly finned compared to the<br>controls next I decided to look at the<br>regional function just to see whether<br>the abnormal regional thinning was<br>causing any functional problems and this<br>was fearfully done by the visual field<br>test which is the gold standard for<br>assessing original function the<br>participant was instructed to focus on<br>the central fixation cross and to press<br>a button on a clicker whenever a<br>stimulus such as this one a scene and<br>this is just to demonstrate to you that<br>the stimuli can be anywhere in the field<br>in they vary in intensity now the visual<br>field index which is essentially a<br>percentage score of the overall<br>sensitivity of the retina is plotted<br>here and in the AL<br>imus group the visual field in DX was<br>again significantly reduced now although<br>the visual field test is the gold<br>standard I've noticed some disadvantages<br>during my data collection for instance<br>it requires very good attention from the<br>patient and I've noticed that in my<br>elderly patients a lot of them were<br>showing signs of an attention such as<br>wandering of their eyes or closing of<br>the eyes making the results unreliable<br>now a list comment but potentially more<br>reliable method of measuring regional<br>function as the electroretinogram or ERG<br>for short during ERG and measurement the<br>electrodes that are attached the<br>participants eyes are measuring the<br>response from the retina as the<br>participant focuses on the chick aboard<br>stimulus such as this one and<br>simultaneously the waveforms are<br>displayed on a separate screen in this<br>required no cognitive input from the<br>patient one important parameter to look<br>at here is the amplitude of the electro<br>retina gram which houses how strongly<br>the retina is responding to the stimulus<br>and here we can see that the amplitude<br>of the ERG is again and significantly<br>reduced and the Alzheimer's group<br>compared to the control groups but what<br>does this all mean well hopefully in my<br>presentation I have demonstrated to you<br>they're in the process of testing with<br>the changes in their eyes is an<br>effective way of setting Alzheimer's<br>patients apart from the controls I have<br>explored the use of OCT four regional<br>Anatomy the use of the visual field in<br>the electroretinogram for the assessment<br>of regional function and I can conclude<br>that there was a significant reduction<br>in regional thickness that is correlated<br>with a significant reduction in retinal<br>function my clinical pilot study has<br>already given me insight for future<br>research involving a larger cohort of<br>study population for instance when it<br>comes to testing the original function<br>the ERG proved to be a more feasible in<br>reliable way of testing regional<br>function<br>in the visual field particularly in the<br>cognitively impaired I would also like<br>to investigate further with a regional<br>examination is sufficiently sensitive<br>and specific when it comes to the early<br>diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease<br>although it's still early days I like to<br>think that in the near future the retina<br>can really become the window to sit to<br>the central nervous system and if dr.<br>Alzheimer was here with us tonight I<br>hope he appreciates the fact that we are<br>looking outside the brain for the early<br>diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease I'd<br>like to acknowledge my supervisors in<br>the School of Optometry my advisors from<br>the center for brain research and our<br>collaborators in Chile our funding<br>sources and last but not the least all<br>there any question hi okay so and maybe<br>I'll just paraphrase your question just<br>to be sure that I understood it right so<br>you're wondering whether and how young<br>the participants will have to be for me<br>to detect the cognitive impairment okay<br>so and the normal population there's<br>usually a slight cognitive decline the<br>age of 65 is usually the cutoff so and<br>I'm expecting that of the disease is due<br>to Alzheimer's disease and there are two<br>general types but early on sit in the<br>late onset so I don't think age is a<br>fair parameter per se to look at and<br>it'll be due to the actual<br>pathophysiology of the disease but the<br>the protocol of describing here I think<br>I will be able to and to take<br>Alzheimer's disease despite of the age<br>but I'm more related to the severity of<br>cognitive impairment hi I was just<br>illnesses or things that are diagnosed<br>through I testing whether I is the<br>window to the brain okay really for for<br>cognitive impairment it is a novel<br>method but for things like and for<br>diseases such as I'm stroke so if the<br>stroke is affecting certain part of the<br>visual pathway then the visual field<br>test will actually show a quite a<br>distinctive pattern and it will show you<br>and which part of the brain the stroke<br>happened so and it has been explored in<br>the past for other neurological<br>conditions but not for neurodegenerative<br>I mean to just prove that was great okay<br>I'm glad you paid attention to the<br>number of samples i had so and ideally<br>in the ideal world i was hoping to have<br>equal numbers of participants for all of<br>my three and whether the young control<br>elderly control in Alzheimer's cases and<br>unfortunately some of the participants<br>I've recruited I've had to exclude hinz<br>and the small sample size for<br>particularly the Alzheimer's group and<br>I've actually had to exclude some people<br>because um incidentally we found they<br>didn't have Alzheimer's disease but they<br>had different types of dementia so and<br>for now I I would say that it's probably<br>in the ideal world I'd like to recruit<br>more participant and although I'm in the<br>final few months of my PhD I am still<br>diligently recruiting for participants<br>just to make my result more robust so<br>oh yes so and off the limited samples i<br>had i have done the one-way anova and<br>just to see whether there's a<br>significant difference between the<br>groups yeah so that there was the method<br>i used although the sample sizes were<br>uneven yeah for like correct and if the<br>model is predictable sort of like that<br>works and what the losses train your<br>just close the monitor life in my life<br>most of the time hold it point all day<br>like targets are coming along the water<br>the mother one but if the model is not<br>working properly then the test points<br>you're close right ok so i guess i guess<br>your your if I paraphrase your question<br>is the and most of my data are normally<br>distributed okay so and yeah you're<br>absolutely right so any clinical data<br>are very variable and take a very simple<br>measurement for example the intraocular<br>pressure which everyone would have had<br>done if you've been to an optometrist<br>that actually doesn't follow a normal<br>distribution either so for that purpose<br>i've actually run a parametric and<br>nonparametric statistical analysis just<br>to see whether the different analysis<br>makes a difference to my statistical<br>significance values and they do for the<br>for the samples i have analyzed yeah but<br>i do hope that a larger sample size will<br>give me even more robustness in my</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
