on<br>Grafton campus and it's my pleasure to<br>talk to you this evening about my<br>research which is titled in vitro immune<br>response screening of bone graft<br>scaffolds and before I start I'd just<br>like to thank the exposure committee for<br>this excellent opportunity to present my<br>research so I want to break down my<br>project we need to start with bone<br>grafts so what are bone grafts<br>essentially bone grafts are filler<br>material they bridge defects in bone<br>whenever bone loss exceeds the healing<br>capacity of bone and these free x-rays<br>are from real patients at auckland city<br>hospital and they showcase for free main<br>reasons why we use bone grafts so over<br>here on the Left we have a woman who had<br>a fracture in her leg and despite<br>intensive fixation using rods and screws<br>this fracture hasn't healed it's caused<br>a non-union and there's a bow a hole<br>still in the bone in the middle this is<br>a man who fell off a motorcycle at high<br>speed and this intense traumatic injury<br>has caused a hole in the bone which we<br>needs to which we need to fill up and<br>over here on the right we have someone<br>who had a cancer just above the knee and<br>when we remove this cancer remove the<br>tumor there's going to be a hole in the<br>bone and again we need to fill up the<br>hole so bone grafts there's a hole in<br>the bone and we need to fill it up the<br>most commonly used bone graft right now<br>is hip bone so this is a basically a<br>second operation but it has two main<br>problems firstly the complication rates<br>are unacceptably high with this surgery<br>so patients report half the time<br>long-term pain infection as possible<br>there's bleeding complications and<br>secondly you need bone on your hip right<br>we can't take it all off so we can only<br>take a limited amount so because of<br>these two reasons we need alternatives<br>to the current methods and that's what<br>bone scaffolds provide<br>bone scaffolds are essentially just any<br>material that promotes bone healing and<br>these can be natural materials which are<br>for ya naturally in the body already all<br>these can be synthetic materials which<br>are kind of lab made or composites which<br>are a mixture of the two and it's a hot<br>topic in orthopedics right now the<br>current market is a 400 billion u.s.<br>dollar market worldwide and there's two<br>main forms the ones on the Left look a<br>bit more gelatinous and those are aimed<br>to be injected through the skin the ones<br>on the right a bit more solid more like<br>normal bone and he's going to be put in<br>more like normal bone grafts currently<br>there's about 50 of these bone scaffolds<br>available to surgeons but none of them<br>are being used more than the hip bone<br>okay none of them are first-line choices<br>and this is because they don't work so<br>immune rejection is often implicated<br>with these bone scaffolds and last year<br>alone there was a million reports of<br>failure due to immune rejection so this<br>paper here of a bottom shows<br>complications associated with just one<br>of these bones gap olds and in this<br>paper they show that some patients<br>actually died because of the immune<br>response that was caused so we have a<br>situation where patients are dying<br>because we are failing to test things<br>properly before we put stuff into their<br>bodies this is inconceivable it's<br>absolutely unacceptable and this needs<br>to be changed and we believe this is<br>because of the the general rush to<br>clinic with the production of these<br>scaffolds so when they start in vitro or<br>test you testing they focus on toxicity<br>they don't they look at is this scaffold<br>toxic to bone cells they don't look at<br>immune cells will this cause immune<br>rejection so because they start off on<br>the wrong foot when they go down into<br>the human trials the problem remains and<br>patient safety remains compromised so<br>the aim of my project was to screen a<br>set of bone scaffold by immune response<br>assays to predict some youn response so<br>will this scaffold be rejected will it<br>be accepted when it gets to the human<br>stage and of course the clinical ain't<br>being a safe the transition from the<br>bench fruit of a bedside so we're very<br>lucky of a bone and joint group people<br>actually give us stuff<br>to test so we had six scaffolds<br>available when I started from across the<br>world so we had a mixture of synthetic<br>and natural based scaffolds some from<br>the United Kingdom some from Portugal<br>and some from New Zealand so the<br>methodology is actually quite simple<br>with what I did so I just took some<br>immune cells put them on to some the<br>scaffolds and then on days 1 and free I<br>looked at inflammatory genes and<br>inflammatory proteins and of course we<br>have controls don't worry about the<br>negative control the key to<br>understanding my work really lies with<br>these two positive controls so firstly<br>we use the chemical called p.m a now<br>that is known to aggressively activate<br>the immune system so this control showed<br>us the leveling of inflammation we'd<br>expect with immune rejection okay and<br>secondly we used suture material or<br>stitching material which is used every<br>time a patient undergoes a surgery and<br>we know this is this causes some<br>information but it's acceptable to<br>patients okay so this gave us a level<br>that was acceptable to patients so we<br>had two controls one showing rejection<br>levels one showing acceptable levels of<br>information so this graph shows the free<br>controls of a bottom along with the six<br>scaffolds on the x-axis and the y-axis<br>is information on a log scale and we're<br>just going to look at the jeans first so<br>if we look at the rejection control that<br>I just mentioned is set up around 300 to<br>400 so I drew a line across and that's<br>the levels would expect with rejection<br>if we looked at the acceptable control<br>is mapped it it maximizes around 15 so I<br>drew a line across and anything below<br>that line should be acceptable to be to<br>the body so if we look to be too united<br>kingdom scaffolds these are well below<br>that line of acceptable inflammation so<br>we would say okay these are okay to move<br>on to the next stage of testing the two<br>from portugal were a little bit higher<br>but again still below the<br>mine which we're saying is acceptable so<br>they're going to be at least as<br>acceptable as suture material however<br>the ones that we tested from New Zealand<br>was very different the story was very<br>different and least set up nearer the<br>rejection line right here and if you<br>remember this is a log scale the<br>difference between those two values is<br>quite exaggerated so this is looking<br>dangerous at this point we're thinking<br>it might not be safe to continue testing<br>these scaffolds we also looked<br>inflammatory proteins because it's<br>important to match genes with proteins<br>and this tells the same story with the<br>two new zealand scaffolds being up at<br>this route level of rejection with the<br>other ones being below the acceptable<br>line so to summarize the scaffolds we<br>tested that were from New Zealand we<br>predict that these will cause an immune<br>riya rejection and they're dangerous in<br>their current form it shouldn't be put<br>through and any further however the ones<br>from the United Kingdom and Portugal<br>we're going to say these are safe and so<br>they're okay to process on further<br>importantly though these two scaffolds<br>from New Zealand were jus for animal<br>studies this year before I started and<br>this is because they did some toxicity<br>tests and they found that they didn't<br>kill bone cells okay so they didn't look<br>at immune cells they looked at does it<br>kill bone cells it didn't kill bone<br>cells they decided to do animal studies<br>but because of this immune screen work<br>they've now prevented that from<br>happening and the scaffolds are now<br>being redesigned so to conclude we was<br>able to identify on suitable scaffolds<br>and prevent unnecessary animal studies<br>not only saving valuable animal life but<br>also expect experimental time and money<br>I've just put up a couple of things for<br>how I can improve because of course you<br>can always improve firstly when the<br>scaffolds come in we yeah so we<br>sterilize them okay so we yeah so we do<br>sterilize them but there's something<br>called endotoxin which remains if<br>present and<br>surely okay so fat is still in there<br>it's going to cause a false positive<br>results okay so the results aren't true<br>so we have to still test for that to<br>rule out contamination and secondly<br>secondly if we just increase the number<br>of inflammatory dreams genes and<br>proteins that we are looking at we can<br>increase with validity so I want to end<br>on this slide where I showed this paper<br>saying that some patients were dying<br>because we're not testing things<br>properly so because we was able to<br>identify on suitable scaffolds in this<br>work I believe that if not if we hadn't<br>have done this those scaffolds may have<br>got through to clinic and patients may<br>have died because of it so I also<br>believe we should start now using immune<br>screening as standard for any bones<br>careful that comes through so that we<br>can ensure complete bench right through<br>to bedside transition of safety I just<br>like to acknowledge my three supervisors<br>the Auckland bone and joint group some<br>visitors we had along the year as in the<br>year and also my funding sources and<br>with that I like to conclude my<br>presentation and I like to open up the<br>yep what was the difference between them<br>yep so there's quite a lot of things<br>different right so the Portuguese ones<br>are based off natural materials okay so<br>they one of them is actually made of<br>starch the other ones are purely<br>synthetic polymers and the pore size is<br>different between each one so if I let's<br>go back to this photo so see if it on<br>the right there's there's pores in that<br>scaffold and that's because the blood<br>needs to get in and it needs to put<br>cells in there and it needs to inform<br>you you both those pore sizes are<br>different between the scaffolds as well<br>and the ones that have seemed to be<br>failing have very very small pores and<br>we think that's actually the reason<br>that's causing this trouble here earlier<br>they're there but nanometer small yeah</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
