childhood obesity<br>using the children of stroke cohort<br>which is an open lead study consisting<br>of six year old children I'll be also<br>looking at environmental factors and how<br>this may influence or modify the genetic<br>risk of obesity in these children as<br>most of you know obesity is a serious<br>public health issue and is associated<br>with long-term increased risk of<br>diabetes heart disease and early death<br>more alarmingly though children are<br>becoming more obese and they're<br>presenting with the same clinical<br>symptoms and it's no different in New<br>Zealand with approximately one and three<br>children either overweight or obese<br>furthermore within New Zealand there are<br>ethnic differences with the Maori and<br>Pacific Island children showing higher<br>rates of obesity when compared to<br>European children now there are a number<br>of factors that can contribute to the<br>development of obesity and this ranges<br>from what the mother experiences during<br>pregnancy to the ever-growing surplice<br>environment and to the microbiology of<br>the gut but for today's talk I'm going<br>to give you a genetics perspective and<br>how this may contribute to the<br>development of obesity but why is<br>obesity such a major issue in today's<br>society that fifty gene hypothesis was<br>proposed to explain the modern emergence<br>of obesity historically obesity was<br>considered an advantageous trade during<br>times of feast and famine during feast<br>early humans would store fat in<br>preparation for Thurman now those<br>individuals that had the genetic<br>tendency to store and utilize fat more<br>efficiently were likely to survive<br>famine and pass on the genetics to<br>subsequent generations similarly these<br>humans rent through activity and risk<br>cycles and those that were physically<br>capable hunting and gathering during<br>famine were likely to survive however in<br>today's society there is no famine<br>instead it's replaced by the constant<br>availability of food and decreased<br>exercise levels this creates a mismatch<br>between our genes that have evolved to<br>protect us with today's surplus involve<br>moment resulting in excessive fat<br>storage and obesity however there are a<br>few fundamental flaws associated with<br>this very simple concept mostly<br>regarding the timing the strength and<br>frequency of famine as a selection<br>driver the drifting gene hypothesis<br>state there was no selection pressure<br>off payment on our genes remain neutral<br>and we randomly accumulated these<br>mutations or spelling mistakes in our<br>DNA code over time and when exposed to a<br>certain environmental commission such as<br>today's society those unfortunate to<br>have the wrong combination of spelling<br>at increased risk of becoming obese more<br>recently though as been suggested that<br>the presence of the gene is not enough<br>as how a gene works and when it works<br>which is more important the 50 phenotype<br>hypothesis proposes how a baby develops<br>during pregnancy is based on what the<br>mother experiences in her own<br>environment for example if a mother is<br>exposed to a poor nutrient environment<br>certain genes will be switched on and<br>off to promote and store fat for that<br>baby to increase its survival chance for<br>that expected environment once again if<br>there's a mismatch between that<br>environment and the genes that have been<br>switched on and off then there is<br>increased risk of disease and obesity my<br>project is looking at certain aspects of<br>the thrifty gene hypothesis more<br>specifically I aim to identify genes and<br>its association with obesity trait BMI<br>and percentage body fat in New Zealand<br>children and we know that these genes<br>interact with the environment to<br>contribute to the development of obesity<br>and therefore I'll be looking at<br>environmental factors in particular diet<br>and exercise and how this may modify the<br>genetic risk of obesity our study<br>consists of approximately 1,200<br>six-year-old children and which would<br>collected genetic information from them<br>from either blood or saliva we selected<br>approximately 80 genes and these were<br>measured using a technology which to<br>take these spelling mistakes<br>as shown in this diagram here each dot<br>here represents an individual and each<br>cluster represents a specific<br>combination of spelling what we did is<br>to compare the frequency between this<br>combination and determine whether there<br>is a significant difference between them<br>in explaining obesity risk in these<br>children so here are two examples of<br>gene associated with BMI found in our<br>study what we want to know is what<br>effect these variations of spelling has<br>on BMI scores so here are the BMI scores<br>for all the children having the T<br>spelling of the negr one gene as you can<br>see children having the C version of the<br>same gene showed a small shift to the<br>left indicating a protective effect<br>similarly children having the a version<br>of the oh la femme for gene showed a<br>small shift to the right indicating a<br>susceptible effect I want to stress the<br>point that these genes have varying<br>effects but it's usually a small one<br>this means something else is driving the<br>obesity problem we found many genes<br>associated with obesity traits across<br>many different biological pathways and<br>this includes appetite regulation<br>storage of fat sleep stress we also<br>found two different subset of genes<br>associated with BMI and percentage body<br>fat with only a small sub overlap<br>between them we think we are measuring<br>association for that particular obesity<br>trait and not overall clinical obesity<br>using other indicators of obesity such<br>as waist circumference and waist to hip<br>ratio may help us gather more<br>information and give us a better picture<br>on how obesity develops and identify<br>genes associated with overall chemical<br>obesity and not just for that particular<br>trait alongside with the genetic I've<br>been looking at environmental factors<br>and how they can contribute to the<br>involvement of obesity for example i<br>looked at mother's weight during<br>pregnancy<br>see and how that may influence a child's<br>weight gain later on in life but for<br>today's talk I'm going to be presenting<br>the results of dietary habits of these<br>children and how different diets can<br>interact with genes to increase risk of<br>obesity I'll be also talking about<br>physical activity and how this may<br>modify the genetic risk of obesity and<br>these children dieter information was<br>collected from these children using food<br>frequency questionnaires and separated<br>into three broad categories a healthy<br>diet a traditional diet and a junk diet<br>and the independent score was given for<br>each child for that particular diet<br>here's an example of a healthy diet<br>interaction with the RSP or three gene<br>which is known to regulate appetite here<br>the BMI scores for all three<br>combinations from the RSPO three gene as<br>you can see there is massive overlap<br>between each one indicating there is no<br>difference in BMI score which means<br>there is no interaction between this<br>gene and this diet we observed a similar<br>pattern with a traditional diet and the<br>same gene but when the same gene is<br>exposed to a junk diet the GG<br>combination showed higher BMI scores so<br>children having this combination when<br>exposed to a junk diet are more<br>susceptible to having higher BMI<br>indicating a junk diet gene interaction<br>we have also collected one week's worth<br>of physical activity from these children<br>using these devices called<br>accelerometers which converts<br>acceleration of the body into activity<br>counts here's an example actigraph which<br>is an output file of these<br>accelerometers over a one day period<br>each peak here represents intensity of<br>exercise over one minute time intervals<br>from this data we also can determine<br>sleep patterns from these children as<br>shown by the relative lack of inactivity<br>around these times using this we can<br>determine with the differences in sleep<br>and intensity of exercise is directly<br>correlated to differences in obese<br>outcomes and<br>these children this study offers us a<br>great opportunity to further<br>understanding between the genes and the<br>environment and how they interact with<br>each other to contribute to the<br>development of obesity in the context of<br>early life development and although we<br>do have this fixed genetic risk<br>intervening early in life by modifying<br>certain components of an environment<br>gives us a better outcome in reducing<br>obesity when compared to intervening<br>later on and adulthood I'd like to thank<br>my supervisors professor Andrew shelling<br>Leslie McKellen and an associate<br>professor John Thompson I'd like to<br>thank my advisor dr. Linda cream and the<br>collaborators and participants of the<br>children are scope study I also like to<br>thank the members of the shelling in<br>creel ab and my funding bodies gravida<br>and HSC and also like to thank you for<br>listening to me give my talk today thank<br>particular individuals did you isolate<br>other variables which could be<br>influential in the outcome so for<br>example of a certain cultural group or<br>seven people group had a higher<br>incidence of synergy and therefore for<br>me that is there is a good question now<br>our ethnicity is a major issue in<br>obesity we know certain ethnicities have<br>higher risk of obesity for example like<br>I mentioned the Maori and Pacific island<br>population and even the Pima Indians in<br>the North American all of them have the<br>same gene but all of them have different<br>variations of the gene the Maori<br>population may have one different<br>combination of the gene which increases<br>that risk of obesity and that's what<br>we're looking at we're looking at the<br>presence of what kind of variations do<br>they have in that gene that makes them<br>you know yeah there is the same genes in<br>the European population but the fact is<br>this gene I gotta make sure no no no we<br>don't sound I'll cohort consists of<br>mostly Caucasian children we've got a<br>mostly our children from the Auckland<br>hospital and which is a had a<br>ninety-five percent of European<br>ethnicity we do have some Maori asian<br>and pacific island population but one of<br>the problems with these studies is power<br>if you don't have enough population you<br>decrease the power and you may have an<br>increase association and discover false<br>discovery gene so you might find an<br>association but is that true because you<br>only have such a small sample set from<br>those own populations so we cannot<br>really break it down on ethnicity based<br>on the fact ninety-five percent of our<br>population of European descent but in<br>saying that we are collecting samples<br>from Middlemore which are mostly highly<br>have a higher percentage of Maori and<br>Pacific island children we can access<br>cohorts from Finland and Norway which<br>have really good detail cohorts we would<br>collaborate with England and Ireland<br>also which have a different European<br>ethnicity there so adding all of this<br>can increase power and also maybe<br>determine if geographical location also<br>have differences in the frequency of<br>having different variations in those<br>jeans as well something<br>so it's mostly like here Winston's could<br>be an editor well for this project we've<br>been looking out the gene and it could<br>have the genes could interact with<br>certain components of food that may<br>increase risk of obesity for example we<br>know that certain variations of genes<br>can interact with higher fatty foods<br>that may increase or decrease risk of<br>obesity with them in terms of additive<br>of stuff and water and food yet there<br>may be a possibility I did not<br>specifically investigate certain<br>components of that but we have looked at<br>dietary patterns of these children we<br>have looked at breastfeeding from the<br>mother and all of these you know could<br>be including we've looked at smoking<br>status of these mothers as well but in<br>saying that we have a low frequency of<br>mothers that smokers am a lot of<br>published literature knows nowadays that<br>smoking is hazardous during pregnancy<br>and and so a lot of the mothers don't<br>smoke but we have a great biobank which<br>we collected a lot of information even<br>pregnancy data from 15 weeks 20 for 20<br>weeks and seventy two weeks and we<br>collected hormones from these mothers as<br>well so we can correlate all of this<br>with the genes to see if they have<br>increase or decrease risk of obesity so<br>with the dietary stuff we have I've just<br>showed dietary today but we're broken<br>down into three patterns so yeah there<br>could be possible association between<br>what's in the environment and how they<br>interact with the genes to increase<br>obesity risk in particular ethnicities<br>as well you looked at across any<br>correlation<br>and poverty and genetic markers we do<br>have socio-economic class and most<br>educational equals off appearance as<br>well because you can look at Jack tires<br>and they're a lot cheaper yes then sort<br>of healthy diet and before comedy is<br>obviously effective and that's it's a<br>good start we can first of all break it<br>down into looking at where the<br>socio-economic class and poverty and<br>these populations associated with higher<br>increase of junk diet we can look at<br>that first and say okay there is a<br>correlation between poverty and junk<br>diet and then we can go one step further<br>and say is there is it a transition from<br>genes with poverty or is it mediated by<br>the fact it's that junk died based on<br>poverty so we can look at that model as<br>well and will be we will be looking at<br>that and creating a profile as you can<br>say with how environment in certain<br>components environment interact with the<br>gene to increase their be City risk in<br>children and hopefully translate this</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
