As New Zealandâ€™s pre-eminent research-led institution, our passion is to make a difference to our society, and the world. One of the ways we do this, is to shine a light on infectious diseases.<br>Learn more at http://pages.achievetheamazing.ac.nz/en/light.html.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my mom tells me that when I was a kid we<br>garden and I've always just been<br>interested in these creatures that glow<br>like how do they do it and what do they<br>do it<br>for I was that kid who had glowing stars<br>on my<br>ceiling how do I feel about the process<br>of discovery well it's exciting right<br>finding out stuff that nobody else knows<br>that's sort of an amazing thing<br>really you never know where that process<br>of discovery is going to take you and<br>then where it's going to take somebody<br>else when they build on what you've<br>done what we do in my lab is we take the<br>chemical reaction that glowing creatures<br>use and we repurpose it to try and find<br>new medicines scientists many years ago<br>discovered the genes that glowing<br>creatures use to make these chemicals to<br>make light and so we and many others<br>have taken those genes and put them into<br>other microbes so we put them into nasty<br>super bugs and we make them glow in the<br>dark and the idea is that they'll only<br>glow when they're alive so we can<br>basically use that to try and find<br>things that kill them so if the bacteria<br>are killed the lights will go<br>out all around the world microbes are<br>becoming more resistant to antibiotics<br>and this is making them more difficult<br>to treat there is going to come a day<br>where there's no antibiotics left to<br>use antibiotic resistance is a bit like<br>global warming or other slowly<br>developing environmental<br>catastrophes over the next 20 or 30<br>years it may well lead to very<br>unfortunate result where we won't have<br>the same ability to treat infections as<br>we have now and if we continue with the<br>high levels of antibotic use that we<br>have at the moment we will inevitably<br>over the next decade or so have high<br>levels of antibiotic resistance that<br>will be bad for the health of our<br>children and<br>grandchildren now this doesn't just mean<br>that common infections will be<br>untreatable it also means things like<br>surgery and chemotherapy for cancer<br>become really life-threateningly risky<br>it'll be like turning black the clock<br>100 years the big benefit about using<br>bioluminescence is the speed of it if we<br>wanted to know how many bacteria we had<br>in a sample we would incubate them and<br>wait for them to grow some bacteria like<br>the one that causes TB can take weeks<br>and weeks but by measuring light we<br>don't have to do that at all we can just<br>put it in a machine press a button and<br>say tell me how much light there is<br>the thing I'm most excited about at the<br>moment is a collaboration we have with<br>landare research they have been<br>collecting fungi for the last 50 years<br>and have about 10,000 of them um fungi<br>from all over New Zealand and South<br>Pacific so the reason fungi are exciting<br>is because the first antibiotic that was<br>discovered penicillin comes from a<br>fungus and we're trying to see if any of<br>them produce new<br>antibiotics painting with glowing<br>bacteria is like working with invisible<br>ink you can't see what you're doing you<br>can't see where you've written but<br>wherever I put the bacteria that's where<br>they should grow and wherever they grow<br>glow I had no idea that I would have<br>been able to make a career out of the<br>two things I'm really passionate about<br>creatures that glow in the dark and<br>nasty super<br>bugs I come into the lab and I can swirl<br>my flask of glowing bacteria and just<br>see that glow and it kind of makes it<br>all worthwhile it's like everything's<br>going to be fine we'll survive we'll<br>medicines</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
