stay with your<br>families and friends drinking a beer and<br>we are here you are together with me for<br>us to exchange a few ideas obviously<br>before I start I would heartily tank<br>Catalina

keep on<br>bringing different people from around<br>the globe to share thoughts with you and<br>I hope we can do the same in Brazil it's<br>really interesting for us the new<br>zealand enough of Law Foundation not<br>only invited me but I would like to<br>thank again carolina for for funding my<br>trip to New Zealand and again extremely<br>honored I realized where's Nina here<br>because Nina will make some comments<br>after my presentation I realized first<br>of all that this lecture was created in<br>2012 and that before me at least two<br>other women presented those who read and<br>Catherine Rogers<br>this is impressive let me go back this<br>is impressive as we are going to discuss<br>tonight the issue of diversity it shows<br>to me that at least carolina and<br>carolina and petra they pay attention to<br>this important subject nowadays<br>obviously I'm part of the subject I'm a<br>woman and i am from Latin America a<br>developing country the subject of my<br>speech why i chose the subject I believe<br>that nowadays it is say it's an<br>essential debate that we need to have<br>from this moment on in the coming years<br>we want to guarantee the legitimacy in<br>international arbitration so far with it<br>very well but we have a lot of work<br>ahead of us the world has changed<br>significantly in the last 35 years with<br>you will know and you are all part of<br>that globalization we are all connected<br>we exchanged products ideas money and<br>experiences globally in incredible fast<br>pace we are more plural if we want a<br>well-accepted international dispute<br>methods it needs to represent all this<br>plurality all this diversity that we can<br>easily perceive otherwise those new<br>players that we will talk about in a<br>while they will search other tools to<br>solve their disputes<br>we are not talking about gender issues<br>we are talking about race especially my<br>area of concern nationality age<br>obviously and also participation of no<br>lawyers in these methods that we have<br>chosen to solve disputes that is<br>arbitration the common arbitrator and I<br>will focus my presentation on the of the<br>arbitrator i will talk also about the<br>ones that are acting as counsel but the<br>common arbitrator is male whites mature<br>a lawyer a lawyer and from developed or<br>western country is it a problem not at<br>all but we will see that with increase<br>of cases we will have to deal with some<br>difficulties in the future the first<br>time that this issue of diversity was<br>discussed openly was in Miami recently<br>last year 2014 we had two main streams<br>in our program in Miami we had a very<br>boat say a touchable issue that is<br>precision in arbitration proof and other<br>issues that are involved in the work of<br>work in a case and then we have a<br>philosophical discussion about<br>legitimacy of arbitration as a system<br>why we decided to discuss this issue of<br>legitimacy and it has to do with<br>diversity because as you all know<br>arbitration is receiving some quiz<br>and we need to face those criticisms we<br>need to address those quizzes we need to<br>look in the eye of the problems we need<br>to face them and overcome otherwise what<br>is going very well so far will not go in<br>let's mmm and before also I jumped into<br>some statistics that I want to share<br>with you I also wanted to mention a<br>little bit what especially Albert G at<br>vandenberg and his predecessor yen<br>Paulson are doing within the iker iker<br>nowadays i'm currently the vice<br>president is an academic institution<br>does not administer proceedings it's a<br>well-known institution that used to have<br>only 45 members since it was created<br>just after the New York Convention it<br>was a group of 45 friends that were<br>doing arbitration in Europe so they were<br>normally as it would be predominantly<br>mature white male European are traitors<br>and primarily professors and lawyers in<br>few years time albert chan and yen posle<br>they realize that we are in a different<br>world that eeka had to open to these<br>different nationalities so first of all<br>EK is open to everybody nowadays<br>everybody can be a nikka member it has<br>more than a thousand members you<br>probably you're following a little bit<br>the work of Vika because you will host<br>together with<br>Australia here will host eco 2018 it's<br>the it's the most important operation<br>conference that we have in the world<br>each two years and what happened is that<br>albert chan and the and Yin PO so they<br>change it everything within this 45 that<br>used to be the only members they are the<br>governing board members nowadays we have<br>lots of different perspectives first of<br>all we have various judges it's very<br>important for us Council in<br>international arbitration or arbitrators<br>in International operator arbitration<br>the dialogue with judges we have<br>corporate lawyers it's truly important<br>to see the perspective of the clients<br>it's not it's not useful for us counsel<br>and lawyers and end up traders to talk<br>only for ourselves we have lots of Latin<br>Americans lots of asians and also dave<br>williams from New Zealand and and we<br>have nowadays lots of Africans it's an<br>incredible a group of people with highly<br>different experiences and allowing us at<br>Iker to have a unique experience so<br>let's try to analyze a little bit I just<br>mentioned the what the diversity that<br>Iker has achieved judges corporate<br>lawyers women various generations latin<br>americans africa's and agents and<br>pacific nationals<br>and let's add in order to address the<br>issue that I want to address with you<br>let's analyze a little bit the<br>information that we have first first of<br>all this is the chart is an ICC<br>statistic from 1999 you can easily see<br>that arbitration modern arbitration is<br>something quite new for everybody<br>although we have some institutions like<br>lcia with more than 100 years an ITC<br>with almost a hundred years obviously<br>arbitration develops as the economy<br>develops between the two World War there<br>was no cases the number of cases in the<br>scenario of arbitration we start to rise<br>from the end of the Second World War and<br>onwards and we can also see that at the<br>end of the last century ICC one of the<br>major institutions was receiving roughly<br>500 cases per year I see since receiving<br>nowadays 1000 cases per year we can also<br>see the growth of the cases when we you<br>know we analyze the exceeded statistics<br>in the beginning after 69 you know that<br>the Exede conventions from 69 the first<br>case in 72 and few cases for a long<br>period of time and then the number of<br>cases will start to rise from 97 and don<br>they have a total number of 525 cases<br>not only there was a growth in certain<br>institutions and obviously if we look at<br>the LCA numbers we will see also growth<br>I i would i would also like to mention<br>that there there's a huge increase of<br>new institutions in the last decades<br>dozens of new institutions so what we<br>had 30 to 40 years ago it was like three<br>to four institutions nowadays we have<br>dozens we have i see dr with in triple-a<br>we have three great brazil institutions<br>we have hong kong international<br>arbitration centre doing an<br>extraordinary job we have siak singapore<br>international operations center doing a<br>very good job we have see attack we have<br>also institutions we are no Sweden Italy<br>Peru belgium colombia spain chile many<br>other places so we can easily see that<br>we have a few cases 30 years ago and now<br>we have hundreds and hundreds and<br>hundreds of cases going on the pool of<br>and what we can see is that there is<br>still a level of centralization towards<br>North America and Europe if we pay<br>attention again to some ICC statistics<br>we will see that 30 years ago Europe was<br>responsible for not talking about East<br>Europe but Western Europe was<br>responsible for sixty-two percent of the<br>cases 91 sixty-three percent of the<br>cases a large number of cases we will<br>see a great change in this last 30 years<br>you we may also pay attention to for<br>instance pacific less than one percent<br>of the cases in 91 africa the percentage<br>of participation is very little asia is<br>still very very little and it grew a lot<br>as we all notice in this past few years<br>so this is another information given<br>part by the ICC from 2013 what we can<br>see there's a breakdown in relation to<br>all countries what we can see if we pay<br>attention to northern West Europe they<br>represent nowadays within the ICC<br>numbers only thirty percent of the cases<br>thirty-three percent of the cases<br>there's a huge increase of African cases<br>Latin American cases and Asian cases I<br>imagine that Pacific remained roughly<br>the same in relation to number of cases<br>although you have a large participation<br>as a number of arbitrators<br>so what we can see between these two<br>dates 23 years apart from 1990 there was<br>a large percentage of European cases<br>total 23 years ago we have a totally<br>different situation but but obviously<br>again Asia grew a lot Americans grew a<br>lot but because of the Latin America<br>that enter into the world of arbitration<br>but what we can see that in relation to<br>the nationality of the arbitrator's they<br>roughly remain the same what's the<br>attalla tells us that in relation to<br>nationality we are using still the same<br>pool of arbitrators we hear it's another<br>information it's a very recent one also<br>just show that the percentage of our<br>creators that we have worldwide in<br>relation to his ICC cases the vast<br>majority almost thirty percent would be<br>from United Kingdom Switzerland France<br>US and Germany it's quite interesting to<br>it's playing an important role now still<br>not so important as the number of cases<br>Brazil incredibly has become last year<br>and 2014 the third jurisdiction English<br>into I see cases just after USA and<br>France if we have time it's interesting<br>to understand why other Latin American<br>countries are not doing so well in<br>relation to lcia arbitration we are<br>doing a very well illy relation to icc<br>impression but not i would say English<br>arbitration and just also to introduce<br>the thing to you the issue of that<br>diversity became so important that for<br>for the first time in this eeka congress<br>of 2014 we did we did a research add the<br>conference in local with everybody there<br>was a unique opportunity to discuss with<br>the practitioners of arbitration what is<br>going on what do we need to do in the<br>future there were a thousand attendees<br>to the miami eek a convention 500 of<br>those answered the questionnaire and<br>what we could see from the answers<br>reinforces what we have seen from the<br>icc statistics seventy percent of all<br>our men in relation to the one that<br>arbitrators that our arbitrators only<br>seventeen percent are women the rest is<br>men and also it shows that women in<br>international operation is younger than<br>men reinforces what we've been<br>discussing in<br>is the last slides another another<br>interesting information obviously I will<br>send to you all afterwards it will be<br>you can easily assess that the major<br>countries the major the major I've<br>traders or delete arbitrators where they<br>come from Europe North America<br>sixty-nine percent of all the cases we<br>could keep on talking it's cussing<br>information and statistics but I chose<br>to pick up only two others to show you<br>interesting information first of all it<br>was asked for everybody that was<br>attending that said they were sitting in<br>a sabot Raider if they had at least in<br>their lives worked with one developing<br>world arbitrator in their entire lives<br>and impressively i would say forty<br>percent said never although we have a<br>large percentage of cases involving<br>developing country forty percent of<br>those cases never had the participation<br>of a developing country arbitrator and<br>in thirty eight percent with a large<br>percentage only in few cases there were<br>the participation of one person from our<br>developing country interesting also to<br>see that when asked if you have had the<br>opportunity to sit with to developing<br>country arbitrators then<br>the answer is quite eloquent as well<br>everybody said yo sixty percent so no we<br>never had a chance why so eloquent<br>because in this it's a car conference<br>the work hundreds of Latin Americans<br>because it was in Miami close to Latin<br>American even so the numbers show that<br>there was a lack of proper<br>representation of regional players again<br>in relation to gender what we could see<br>there are other information but I chose<br>this one to exchange with you the what<br>they have collected in relation to a<br>participation of women as arbitrator<br>thirty-two percent said they never had a<br>case they never set with a woman in<br>there in there are two panels in a large<br>percentage also said in only few cases I<br>have said with a woman so worried what<br>what is the result what we can see from<br>every data that we have for the first<br>time collected in 2014 that we were<br>perceiving in the last few years is that<br>obviously that majority of international<br>operation practitioners agrees that<br>there is an issue of diversity there was<br>a question presented to us all even the<br>Europeans mayo and white people even the<br>northern American white people what do<br>you think about the issue of diversity<br>do you need to address this issue of the<br>adversity and the majority strongly<br>agree and somewhat agree would say that<br>we are talking about 60 s if 56%<br>that yes there's something that we need<br>to do it's also interesting if we if we<br>make a big break down between women and<br>men that large more than a more than<br>half of the women that were there would<br>say strongly agree that there's<br>something to do men don't believe that<br>is the case only twenty percent of the<br>man said there's something that we need<br>to pay attention to so half of the women<br>said there's something to do more than<br>seventy six percent of the women and a<br>large percentage of on the percentage of<br>the men so this is the diagnosis that I<br>wanted to present to you and then we can<br>move on to discuss the importance of<br>diversity and what to do in the near<br>future these are the findings of the k<br>2014 research over well over all the<br>media Nick attendee and depression<br>council was a male 50 years old with<br>salmon common law legal training and<br>from a developed states over all these<br>results suggest that woman's presence in<br>international operation was relatively<br>small and the proportion of developing<br>roller craters was relatively small the<br>data reflect reflected arguably<br>disproportionate levels of<br>representation by men from states in<br>north america and europe which have high<br>levels of economic development<br>ultimately the data supported rather<br>than disproved claims that international<br>operation is a white male game<br>it's it's interesting to see that what<br>we have discussed a lot during the Zika<br>Congress is that what's happening<br>perhaps in the oppression world is that<br>the parties keep on choosing the same<br>names a sort of insurance policy I will<br>go for the big names I will go for the<br>ones that have been sitting for a long<br>time in international cases I will go<br>for the the ones that everybody knows<br>why is that because if something happens<br>to my case if I lose my case if I am a<br>lawyer an officer and a firm nobody's<br>going to say anything towards me that I<br>didn't there I made a wrong choice so it<br>would be an insurance policy but I I<br>would say that the insurance policy<br>aimed by the parties it's perhaps not<br>working as expected mainly because the<br>problems that we are seeing<br>international operation and even in the<br>mask arbitration lack of availability<br>low quality of the decisions increasing<br>cases with conflicted are traders very<br>hard to find a proper panel and<br>obviously a need to increase the quality<br>of the upper decisions if we are facing<br>at least some decisions with poor<br>quality we need to address those issues<br>otherwise a company that has chosen our<br>creation a certain moment and has no no<br>option to appeal from a wrong decision<br>will never go to international<br>arbitration or Never or national<br>arbitration again so that is gone bottom<br>one one of the speakers from our panel<br>he is from India he made a very good<br>quote that I think shows everything that<br>we want to say when we are talking about<br>diversity if everybody is thinking alike<br>then no one thinking Benjamin Franklin<br>what we want obviously what we want to<br>have is access to different ideas and<br>two different backgrounds as an example<br>in a construction case it's probable<br>that our participation of an engineer<br>depending on the case will enhance the<br>quality of the decision the quality of<br>the assessment of the evidence and then<br>the quality of decision as Peters here<br>in an in an IP case sometimes obviously<br>and especially some IP makes a total a<br>total difference in the case so not only<br>we are talking about gender nationality<br>but sometimes we are choosing our<br>arbitrators only lawyers and they are<br>can during bad decisions because they<br>don't know the industry they don't know<br>the specific specificities of a certain<br>disputes then i would i would also like<br>to to quote what John avedon mentioned<br>in one of this he<br>writings about this it would be a waste<br>of human resource if we don't pay<br>attention to diversity interestingly<br>last friday at the vice president of the<br>International Court of Justice the vice<br>president of the International Court of<br>Justice abdul quack Ahmed Yousef from<br>Somalia he gave a speech about the same<br>issue that we are discussing obviously<br>because there's a huge pressure for<br>African countries to participate in the<br>international collaboration why is that<br>because our clients want to invest in<br>africa and once you have as a proper and<br>safe forward to solve disputes but mr.<br>yusuf a device president I CJ said if<br>you don't invite the Africans to the<br>part of the system if you don't invite<br>the Africans to see those are traitors<br>then we will reject the system that is<br>that is the risk that we immerse we may<br>face in the future so I think we have<br>two issues obviously we have the issue<br>of diversity to bring new people and<br>bring fresh new ideas and enhance the<br>quality of the decision and we have<br>another issue to discuss is the Rays of<br>cases and the needs they importantly<br>that we have to extend the pool of<br>arbitrators to be able to rule on all<br>those cases it's important also to say<br>just to finalize one or two minutes that<br>I think there's no there's a consensus<br>that we should stimulate diversity that<br>it's it's it will be good for the system<br>diversity but not at any<br>costs obviously we are talking about<br>arbitration we are talking about a<br>method to solve disputes with without<br>any possibility to appeal from a wrong<br>decision so experience and quality are<br>crucial we need to find the right people<br>we need to find the diamonds in each<br>jurisdiction and help them raise for us<br>to be able to choose from other<br>countries we also need to preserve the<br>essential stone of arbitration which is<br>party autonomy we don't expect even from<br>me myself adryana when I'm sitting is<br>counsel we don't expect me to foster<br>diversity when I'm sitting is cat when<br>white men who working is counseling<br>obviously what I want is to beat the<br>case i would try to locate an arbitrator<br>that's appropriate to my case so but<br>what what it can do and this I invite<br>you all and nina i invite you talk to<br>comment on what we need to do in the<br>future I think the institutions have a<br>major role every institution the<br>institution need to play need to prepare<br>the new generations the institution<br>needs to talk about this obviously I<br>think when we talk about diversity one<br>of the main issues when with the main<br>solutions awareness as much as you talk<br>we think about the issue and we pay<br>attention to that diversity issues but i<br>think the institutions should have<br>should if they have lists of arbitrators<br>they should have they should select up<br>or or or or a few spots they should<br>dedicate to yank and brilliant lawyers<br>women obviously and people from all over<br>the world that's what what we are trying<br>to do in brazil<br>days especially in the main Brazil<br>institution that Scott CCBC obviously i<br>think as arbitrators we need to think<br>about diversity issues whenever we are<br>choosing the chair obviously we want to<br>learn from the chair but in cases that<br>we have a very experienced Corp traitor<br>that usually sits the chair it's a<br>unique opportunity to invite someone<br>from a different region to invite<br>someone new to prepare this person for<br>other cases and finally the system will<br>survive as the arbitration system will<br>survive if our clients are satisfied<br>that they have received proper justice<br>nowadays the clients are not only<br>European companies and North American<br>companies but a companies from all<br>around the globe our clients themselves<br>they want bigger lists and neyo<br>experienced and prepare names it's our<br>job as institutional as institution or<br>as a responsible protector to reach that<br>and to give big lists to our clients<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
