Michael Kirby compares recent developments in New Zealand, Australia and the United States.<br> <br>Michael Kirby is one of the world’s most famous judges. He was Australia’s longest serving judge and sat on its highest court. His recent report to the United Nations on human rights abuses in North Korea has attracted world headlines.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>his contributions to the laws of many<br>countries has also been immense not<br>least many of you will have heard of a<br>serving as the chairman of the<br>commission of inquiry into abuse as a<br>North Korea that was a commission of<br>inquiry undertaken at the behest of the<br>United Nations and its report last year<br>into the atrocities in North Korea made<br>world headlines just as Kirby is here<br>today to speak about equal marriage and<br>justice it's obviously a topic of<br>enormous resonance here and now in this<br>country where by legislation equal<br>marriage has gone through just recently<br>but we are in justice Kirby's own<br>country Australia it has been<br>controversial and does not yet been<br>enacted the first equal marriage<br>legislation was in the Netherlands in<br>2001 and since there you've had equal<br>marriage brought forward by legislation<br>of parliament in some countries so<br>Britain New Zealand will be other<br>examples of their occurring but also by<br>referendum in Ireland recently also by<br>judicial decision most obviously by that<br>of the Supreme Court of the United<br>States just earlier this year so it is<br>an incredibly opportune time for justice<br>Kirby to talk to us about what's been<br>happening in the different jurisdictions<br>and what that means for justice in our<br>society justice Kirby is someone who of<br>course is uniquely qualified to talk on<br>this topic because he became australia's<br>first openly gay judge and as someone<br>serving on the highest court in<br>australia it's difficult to remember i<br>think how brave and courageous that was<br>at the time and then i suppose a Mikey<br>Michael Kirby understatement he did this<br>simply by altering his entry in who's<br>who so we're at at the start hit his<br>biographical details he added the fact<br>that Johan was his partner and it's<br>again something that at the time he<br>again in so many ways has been<br>courageous on the behalf of equal rights<br>for lesbian gay bisexual transgender<br>people he's someone<br>who we were just talking at morning tea<br>earlier today about the fact that an<br>Australia today unlike in the New<br>Zealand universities there are some<br>faith-based Australian universities and<br>just recently he's written to one of<br>those universities where that university<br>had banned LGBT students from meeting it<br>had said they weren't allowed to form a<br>society within their University a<br>Catholic based University in Australia<br>and again he took that on he wrote to<br>them and said that this you know in<br>terms of the well-being of those<br>students was quite horrendous so just as<br>he's taken on the North Korean<br>government so he too he took that on and<br>if you read his biography a private life<br>he talks about quite a number of years<br>ago going to Zambia talking to the<br>judges there about AIDS and talking to<br>them again about all sorts of topics<br>that all sorts of people be afraid to<br>raise and he is courageously being<br>willing to do so ray Michael Kirby I was<br>very instrumental just a few years ago<br>when he first came to visit the law<br>school and saying what were we doing<br>about the helping and supporting our<br>LGBT students and at that stage we set<br>up the rainbow law which is the law<br>schools LGBT Network injustice Kirby<br>very kindly agreed to be the founding<br>partner of that group and so I'm very<br>pleased today that we have a number of<br>our rainbow law students here and here<br>to again see Michael Kirby speak i'm<br>also very pleased that we have justice<br>muir here today with his partner James<br>was justice Muir joined the High Court<br>last year and he agreed to become co<br>patron of rainbow law together with<br>justice Kirby and that for us i think is<br>an incredible signal to our students of<br>the way in which LGBT rights are not<br>only important but that people need to<br>stand up and be proud of who they are in<br>the law and elsewhere in society so it<br>really is a very great pleasure today on<br>behalf of everyone here and on behalf of<br>the Faculty of Law to ask you to welcome<br>thank you very much Dean Stockley thank<br>you for your welcome to the Law School<br>of the University of Auckland today<br>although I must say I think you have<br>been receiving lessons from kim jong-in<br>in the way to work people very hard and<br>to make sure that they deliver a maximum<br>production for the benefit of the nation<br>and the supreme leader I honor the Maori<br>people tena koutou tena koutou tena koe<br>20 car to her we learn in Australia from<br>the sincere way in which that moment of<br>reflection and all of the injustice that<br>have been done in the law and in society<br>needs to be reflected upon so that we<br>correct the wrongs of the past and<br>address ourselves to the right path for<br>the future my talk to you this afternoon<br>is divided like Caesars Gaul into three<br>parts the first is to do what is always<br>done in a medical conference you have to<br>acknowledge any interest whatsoever that<br>you may have that may make your<br>observations in the talk that you're<br>going to have affected by an external<br>interest the second will be to review<br>the history of the reform of the law and<br>the changes in the law affecting LGBTIQ<br>people lesbians gays bisexual intersex<br>transgender and other queer people in<br>recent years in three cities a tale of<br>three cities of the changes that have<br>been affected in Wellington New Zealand<br>with which people in this audience will<br>be well familiar the changes that have<br>come about Reese<br>in Washington in DC in the United States<br>of America and thirdly of changes that<br>have been attempted and are still<br>underway in Canberra in the capital of<br>my own country Australia and then<br>finally I'm going to try to draw 10<br>lessons for how the extraordinary<br>development that has been achieved in<br>the relationship recognition of LGBT<br>citizens in these three countries has<br>actually occurred in the last Ted last<br>10 15 years and how the lessons can be<br>learned from those achievements for<br>other countries which are recalcitrant<br>or which are holding up the journey of<br>progress now my first point of<br>acknowledgement relates to my own sexual<br>orientation as a gay man I don't think<br>this will come as a terrible shock I<br>don't think it's likely that there will<br>be a big walk out but earlier on that is<br>likely to have led to some dismay and<br>disquiet all feeling of anxiety or<br>unpleasantness discomfort by people who<br>receive that news well the answer is<br>you've got to receive it and get over it<br>and if you have a problem you've got to<br>have a glass of water possibly an<br>aspirin a good lie down and you will<br>feel much better after that and<br>receiving the knowledge and information<br>is good for you because it's ultimately<br>knowledge and information based on<br>science and reality which is always good<br>for everybody I too want to acknowledge<br>the presence here of Justice Muir and of<br>James I welcome their comradeship in<br>being here when I heard of Justice muirs<br>appointment I proposed to the rainbow<br>law group at the<br>versity of auckland that they should<br>invite him to be a co patron and today<br>I've indicated that they have to go<br>immediately on a very quick search to<br>find at least one woman patron of the<br>rainbow law because it's not a good look<br>to have just two gentlemen we need<br>people from every community and every<br>different gender now I turn now to the<br>the story of the last 15 years before i<br>do so i should say just closing off the<br>first paragraph of what i have to say<br>that i don't feel in addressing the<br>issue of marriage equality that I bring<br>a biased viewpoint I bring an informed<br>viewpoint I bring a viewpoint that<br>supports the notion and availability of<br>marriage equality which you have<br>attained in new zealand by legislation<br>and which has been attained in the<br>united states by judicial decision but<br>it's not something that immediately<br>affects me i have been with my partner<br>johan van floatin over the past forty<br>six years 46 years my most of my public<br>life we met in 1969 and i was appointed<br>to my first public office in december<br>1974 so we had already by that stage<br>been together for five years and we had<br>twice cross the mighty plains of Asia in<br>a combi van anybody who can survive one<br>year let alone two years in a fog<br>swaggin combi van with another human<br>being is almost certainly bound to face<br>the long haul and the long distance<br>and so we have been together for 46<br>years to me it has been a great blessing<br>and I think it's been a great benefit to<br>my public life I believe that it's been<br>a benefit for the people in public life<br>with whom I have worked in fact in the<br>High Court of Australia everyone without<br>exception really like my partner they<br>found him as I do very very witty and<br>amusing and they found him extremely<br>direct he is from the Netherlands they<br>are very direct people not all of them<br>had quite the same feelings of love and<br>affection for myself but everyone liked<br>him and I have no doubt that it was good<br>for them to work and to socialize with<br>my partner of 46 years we had outlasted<br>most of the wedding's we went to all<br>that confetti we endured all those gifts<br>we gave many of them broke down and fell<br>apart in misery grief and in the divorce<br>courts but we continued on and it's not<br>at all sure for us that we would get<br>married if marriage were available in<br>Australia the reason for that I can<br>quickly explain I think that if you have<br>had 46 years without benefit of a piece<br>of official paper you don't really need<br>or feel the need for the benefit of the<br>piece of paper in fact seeking the piece<br>of paper from the state would perhaps in<br>the back of our consciousness appear to<br>be asking for something which was<br>essential which you didn't have over 46<br>years there is another factor that if<br>you disturb the integers of a very long<br>term loving<br>and supportive relationship you have to<br>run the risk that things might change<br>would it change if you moved from pure<br>love affection and support to a<br>relationship based on law and based on<br>the law of the state would it alter in<br>its quality or kind we have naturally<br>spoken about this but haven't made any<br>final decision perhaps we would get<br>married if only to honor those who in<br>Australia have worked and struggled hard<br>to get marriage equality we certainly<br>believe marriage should be there for<br>fellow citizens who feel the need of it<br>but we are not entirely convinced that<br>we want it and I explained that at the<br>start so that you'll understand that I<br>can approach the issue of marriage<br>equality with a degree of dispassion and<br>looking at it as a lawyer who believes<br>it should be there but not bent over in<br>an ardent and urgent desire to have it<br>to us it's an intellectual entitlement<br>not something that we feel a deep and<br>immediate need for I've been to recent<br>events in Australia that happened soon<br>after the refusal of the coalition<br>parties in Australia to agree to a<br>conscience vote in the australian<br>federal pound on the issue of marriage<br>equality which refusal put an end for<br>the mound to the attainment of marriage<br>equality in australia and i was told of<br>a number of people it was mentioned at<br>the functions who are now in advanced<br>years who one of whose partners was<br>about to die and who had set her heart<br>upon the availability of marriage for<br>such a person the issue I'm going to<br>speak about is not just an intellectual<br>a paradigm it's a matter of very deep<br>personal felt need and I respect those<br>who feel that way I just indicate to you<br>at the outset I don't feel that way I'm<br>looking at this matter as a lawyer as a<br>former judge as a citizen and it's there<br>for a cause I feel I can add my<br>contribution to now the tale of three<br>cities must begin in Wellington New<br>Zealand with the steps that took this<br>country on a journey that ended with the<br>adoption of the amendment act to the<br>marriage act in this country we you<br>start exactly is a matter of conjecture<br>but certainly one important step on the<br>road was the decision in 1986 to present<br>to the New Zealand parlant legislation<br>and amending legislation to change the<br>criminal laws that provided for criminal<br>for crimes and for penalties upon<br>conviction of persons who were convicted<br>of the so-called unnatural crimes in New<br>Zealand it only ever applied to males<br>and it reflected a particular British<br>view of sexual relations which in turn<br>had been borrowed from Old Testament<br>provisions in the Bible and it was an<br>export which with the many wonderful<br>gifts that the British exported to their<br>empire they gave to every country that<br>was ever under the Union Jack every one<br>of those countries received its anti-gay<br>laws sodomy law crimes so-called<br>unnatural crimes which continued to<br>afflict 42 of the 54-member<br>countries of the Commonwealth of Nations<br>those crimes are still solidly and he<br>moved parrot alia movably in place but<br>in New Zealand the step for reform came<br>about a decade after the two decades<br>after the reform was introduced in<br>England in 1967 the reform in New<br>Zealand came in 1986 and by that time I<br>was the President of the Court of Appeal<br>of New South Wales I was a close friend<br>of Sir Robin Cook and of many other New<br>Zealand judges I came over here many<br>many times and I knew many of the actors<br>who were involved in the New Zealand<br>moves to reform the criminal law<br>including actors in the National Party<br>which was in government shortly before<br>this and then in the Labour Party and I<br>mentioned in particular Fran Wilde MP in<br>the Labour Party who who's bill was<br>enacted in 1986 until you had that<br>reform you couldn't even begin to think<br>about relationship recognition if all<br>sexual acts between males however<br>consenting however conducted in private<br>however limited to one person were<br>criminal then you can't start to think<br>about admitting as lawful a relationship<br>which will involve such acts and<br>accordingly at least for miles it was<br>unthinkable before 1986 so I pay a<br>tribute to Fran Wilde and for those in<br>the New Zealand Parliament who enacted<br>the law it didn't pass with a huge vote<br>it was extremely controversial in this<br>country it had already been enacted in<br>many of the states of Australia the<br>reform in Australia had begun<br>in South Australia in 1974 under the<br>government of don dunstan but in New<br>Zealand it came about in 1986 then in<br>May 1996 a decade later the High Court<br>of New Zealand in a case called quilter<br>against the Attorney General ruled that<br>the Marriage Act 1995 did not envisage<br>as the applicants asserted marriage<br>between persons of the same sex the<br>plaintiffs had argued that the Marriage<br>Act 9055 of New Zealand did not<br>specifically restrict marriage to<br>opposite-sex couples nor did it<br>expressly forbid opposite sex<br>relationships from being a marriage<br>however the plaintiffs had another<br>string to their bow and that was based<br>upon the Human Rights Act of 1993 that<br>act prohibited discrimination on the<br>basis of sexual orientation whilst the<br>Bill of Rights Act 1990 created a right<br>to freedom from discrimination on the<br>grounds in the Human Rights Act<br>including sexual orientation and the<br>Human Rights Act of 1990 also provided<br>that interpretations of legislation<br>consistent with the Bill of Rights were<br>to be preferred where possible however<br>the High Court of New Zealand applying<br>the test for the meaning of marriage at<br>common law which had been expounded in<br>England<br>in the case of Hyde against hide in the<br>19th century held that this restriction<br>of marriage to opposite-sex couples was<br>implied in the use of the legal term<br>marriage and that legal term had<br>imported the common law definition and<br>therefore under the Act as it then stood<br>you could not have an OP Saini sex<br>marriage in New Zealand because that had<br>been outside the contemplation of the<br>Parliament of New Zealand in enacting<br>the marriage act with a legal term which<br>had a settled definition in the common<br>law and so the High Court of New Zealand<br>rejected the claim but it went on also<br>to hold that the limitation of access to<br>marriage was a justifiable to<br>opposite-sex couples was a justifiable<br>limitation within the Bill of Rights Act<br>of 1990 of New Zealand on the basis that<br>that was what marriage had always been<br>defined the category and then having to<br>find it too cold that it was only<br>available for that category was all that<br>could be expected of a marriage so<br>called that decision was appealed to the<br>Court of Appeal of New Zealand in<br>December 1997 and in that year that<br>decision was delivered by the Court of<br>Appeal in quilter against the Attorney<br>General and the Court of Appeal of New<br>Zealand held that the High Court had not<br>heard in its conclusion on either of the<br>two points first that it was not within<br>the language of the statute and second<br>that interpreting it in this way was not<br>contrary to the Bill of Rights Act<br>Justice Thomas dissented<br>he said well he was prepared to go along<br>with the first of the findings but it<br>was obviously contrary to the Bill of<br>Rights Act of 1990 because it was<br>discriminatory on the ground of sexual<br>orientation which was a ground<br>recognized in the Bill of Rights Act and<br>so he disagreed with the decision and he<br>dissented from it when i read quilter<br>when it came to Australia I must admit<br>that I thought that the majority judges<br>of the Court of Appeal as a matter of<br>legality technical legality had got it<br>right and that their decision and not<br>justice Thomas's decision was correct I<br>have done penance for that original view<br>on many occasions in New Zealand<br>including in the presence of Justice<br>Thomas in a most celebrated and very<br>well-read public conversation which I<br>had with Justice Thomas all of which<br>goes to show that one's training in the<br>law can often prepare you for formal<br>approaches to issues which lack the<br>bringing of a fresh mind to the issue<br>which Justice Thomas I believe did he<br>brought a fresh mind and he said well it<br>may be that that's what Parliament<br>intended by the use of the word marriage<br>picking up the interpretation of the<br>1860s in hide and hide but obviously he<br>thought it was obvious that marriage was<br>to refuse marriage to same-sex couples<br>was contrary to the prohibition on<br>discrimination on the grounds of sexual<br>orientation<br>however majorities rule both in<br>Parliament and in the courts and so<br>justice Thomas's dissent did not affect<br>the outcome and that outcome then stood<br>for 15 years after the decision was<br>handed down in quilt up in 2002 in a<br>case called Jocelyn against new zealand<br>the decision in quilter was effectively<br>challenged before the United Nations<br>Human Rights Committee and it was<br>contended that New Zealand as a party to<br>the International Covenant on Civil and<br>Political protocol under that covenant<br>was answerable to a complaint that it<br>was in breach of the Covenant and that<br>that should be so found by the human<br>rights committee established by the<br>iccpr that argument failed in the Human<br>Rights Committee which held that the<br>unavailability of same-sex marriage in<br>New Zealand did not violate the<br>international government on civil<br>pudding rights so that outcome was a<br>blow to those who in New Zealand was<br>seeking to use the Human Rights<br>Committee to stimulate consideration of<br>the human rights situation resulting<br>from the decision in quilter in may 2002<br>Louisa wall a member of parliament for<br>the Labour Party did not accept either<br>the majority Court of Appeal decision<br>nor the decision of the Human Rights<br>Committee and she introduced aid<br>marriage definition of marriage<br>amendment bill as a private member's<br>bill into the Parliament of New Zealand<br>the purpose of her bill was to amend the<br>definition of marriage in The Marriage<br>Act so that marriage would henceforth be<br>the union of two people regardless of<br>their sex sexual orientation<br>or gender identity the effect of her<br>legislation if adopted would be to allow<br>same-sex couples to marry in New Zealand<br>and also to have access to all rights<br>available to married couples including<br>adoption on the twenty-sixth of July<br>2012 indicating once again the<br>importance of timing of chance and a<br>fortune in all matters of this kind the<br>bill presented by Louisa wall was drawn<br>from the private member's bill ballot in<br>the parliament of New Zealand which gave<br>it the opportunity to be voted on in the<br>parliament of New Zealand immediately<br>both Prime Minister John Key for the<br>national party and the opposition leader<br>David Shearer for the Labour Party<br>stated that they would vote in favor of<br>the bill at all stages however they<br>agreed that their parties the members of<br>their party should have a free<br>conscience vote on the matter having<br>conscience votes on matters of this kind<br>is not unknown the Family Law Act in<br>Australia for example with important<br>changes into family law was the result<br>of a conscience vote in the Australian<br>Parliament on the twenty-ninth of August<br>2012 the first reading of Louisa wall's<br>bill passed on an 80 40 vote with most<br>major parties both major parties having<br>the conscience vote 8040 on the 13th of<br>March 2013 the bill passed a second<br>reading on a 7744 vote and on the<br>seventeenth of april 2013 the bill<br>passed its third and final reading on a<br>7744 vote significantly 27 out of 59<br>members of the national party that's to<br>say almost fifty percent of the National<br>Party voted in favor of the measure as<br>did 30 out of 34 members of the Labour<br>Party<br>and all of the minor parties except the<br>New Zealand first party and the<br>independent Brendan horn the bill<br>received the Royal Assent two days later<br>and on the 19th of august 2013 the<br>amending act came into force when it<br>received the Royal Assent all of you<br>will have seen as I did honest in<br>Australia the very moving scene in the<br>parliament who New Zealand on the<br>passage of Louisa wall's legislation it<br>said a lot about New Zealand and its<br>community and it was for many people<br>around the world far from New Zealand a<br>signal of hope and of dignity and of<br>equality in the United States of America<br>they had to go through much the same<br>process but they had certain additional<br>weapons and certain additional opponents<br>they had to start by overcoming the<br>discriminatory legislation which existed<br>in many states against LGBT people based<br>in part upon religious attitudes and<br>teachings but also in part upon laws<br>which were already in place in 1996 in a<br>case from Colorado the supreme court<br>overturned a constitutional ban on<br>funding and anti-discrimination laws in<br>that state of the United States and more<br>significantly in 2003 in the case of<br>Lawrence against Texas the Supreme Court<br>of the United States struck down the<br>British inherited sodomy anti-sodomy law<br>that was in force in the state of Texas<br>and said that that was unconstitutional<br>in the same year a very important<br>decision was reached by the Supreme<br>Judicial Court of Massachusetts presided<br>over by Chief Justice Marshall that<br>decision was on one view very ill-timed<br>because it intruded into the reelection<br>campaign for president george w bush<br>seeking a second term as president and<br>it caused a great deal of consternation<br>applying the Equality provisions in the<br>state constitution of the state of<br>Massachusetts in the United States of<br>America Justice Marshall and her<br>colleagues in the Supreme Judicial Court<br>held that the unavailability of marriage<br>in the state of Massachusetts would be<br>contrary to the Equality promise of the<br>bill of rights in the state constitution<br>that meant to an enormous uproar in<br>certain circles political circles in the<br>United States of America and it led to<br>the enactment of further DOMA statutes<br>Defense of Marriage Act statutes both in<br>the state legislatures and in the<br>federal legislature of the United States<br>forbidding any step that would amount to<br>a recognition of same-sex marriage that<br>thereby provided a hurdle or an obstacle<br>to same-sex marriage in many parts of<br>the United States in 2013 in a case<br>called Windsor the Supreme Court the<br>United States against Windsor the<br>Supreme Court of the United States in a<br>5-4 decision ruled that the federal<br>government was required to recognized as<br>valid same-sex marriages which had been<br>conducted under state law at that point<br>only ten states of the united states and<br>the District of Columbia<br>provided for marriage licenses to be<br>available to same-sex couples but it was<br>a sufficient number of people who were<br>clamoring on the door of the federal<br>courts asserting that as they had got a<br>valid law under the state of X they were<br>entitled under the provisions of the<br>United States Constitution requiring<br>recognition of the legal acts of the<br>state concerned that their their<br>marriage should be recognized in other<br>states of the union that case succeeded<br>in the Supreme Court of the United<br>States by a five-to-four decision there<br>had been several cases in the<br>intermediate appellate courts in the<br>United States which had divided both<br>ways and it was to resolve the<br>difference in their decisions that led<br>to the decision in Windsor and then on<br>the twenty-sixth of jun 2015 this year<br>in the case of obergefell against Hodges<br>the Supreme Court in the United States<br>once again had to make a ruling on<br>prohibitions on same-sex marriages in<br>the States and whether they were<br>unconstitutional measured against the<br>Federal Constitution the majority in<br>avoca Phil held that the due process and<br>equal protection clauses within the 14th<br>amendment to the Constitution required<br>States to license same-sex marriages and<br>to recognize end of out-of-state<br>same-sex marriages in its reasoning the<br>majority in obergefell held that the Due<br>Process Clause in the American<br>Constitution included a fundamental<br>right to marriage that had been said in<br>earlier decisions including a decision<br>in a case from Virginia which had<br>prohibited marriage between citizens of<br>the United States who were of different<br>races loving against Virginia that<br>decision had been struck down by the<br>supreme court of the united states so to<br>a lawyer it wasn't an entirely<br>surprising decision to apply the loving<br>principle to a law which forbade in the<br>state concerned the facility of marriage<br>marriage said the supreme court was a<br>fundamental right under the Constitution<br>Justice Kennedy wrote the opinion of the<br>majority of the court and he he insisted<br>on the role of marriage in personal life<br>its importance in safeguarding families<br>by individuals and citizen and children<br>that it was of keystone in the nation's<br>social order and that it gave effect to<br>individual autonomy which was a<br>postulate of the United States<br>Constitution the minority in the United<br>States Supreme Court said that the<br>Supreme Court should not intervene that<br>there had been a vigorous debate<br>throughout the united states leading to<br>many state legislatures changing their<br>law that the essence of the approach of<br>the united states constitution was that<br>the people should have a freedom to<br>govern themselves that marriage equality<br>was a matter that rested on the decision<br>of the state legislatures and that's<br>where it should be left there was an<br>interesting toning down of some of the<br>antipathetic rhetoric in obergefell when<br>compared to earlier decisions even<br>Justice Scalia was more temperate in his<br>reasoning and the chief justice Chief<br>Justice Roberts whilst expressing<br>congratulations to the gay community of<br>the United States for the victory which<br>they had one in the decision and hoping<br>that their celebration would be a happy<br>one insisted that in his view the<br>Constitution left the matter to the<br>Legislature's of the states and it<br>should not be decided by a court made up<br>of people who were not necessarily<br>representative of the whole of the<br>American community the third city is<br>Canberra and it has a very tortuous<br>history of involvement in this matter<br>partly because it lacks the legal human<br>rights or bill of rights provisions that<br>ensured the success of the cause in the<br>United States of America and partly<br>because the political dynamics have so<br>far worked against the success of<br>marriage equality in Australia the<br>founders of the Australian Federation<br>looking to the United States in this as<br>in so many other matters came to the<br>conclusion that marriage should not be<br>left to States it should be given to the<br>federal parliament and it is therefore<br>within the powers conferred by the<br>Australian Constitution to enact laws to<br>enact laws for marriage and divorce and<br>in relation thereto to the custody of<br>children and that is the provision in<br>the Australian Constitution which was<br>exercised as late as 1961 before which<br>earlier colonial and state laws applied<br>but in 1961 a Federal Marriage Act was<br>enacted it like New Zealand's Lord did<br>not contain a prohibition on same-sex<br>married but it was argued that it<br>postulated opposite sex marriage because<br>that was what marriage<br>meant it both in 1961 and in common<br>discourse in Australia and that is what<br>should be retained in 1984 curious thing<br>happened in Australia not so curious but<br>furious for this tale that laws began to<br>be enacted in many of the states of<br>Australia for de facto relationships to<br>provide protection for people in de<br>facto relationships both homosexual and<br>heterosexual who were not formally<br>married and that set of provisions was<br>in a way a protection for partners in<br>same-sex relationships but of course it<br>didn't give a relationship recognition<br>in the law in 2004 during the Howard<br>government legislation was enacted which<br>mimicked the legislation which had been<br>adopted in the United States called DOMA<br>the Defense of Marriage Act in a very<br>short envelope of time that mr. Howard<br>possessed when the coalition was in the<br>majority both in the House of<br>Representatives and in the Senate a bill<br>was passed which forbade solemnisation<br>of same-sex marriages in Australia<br>forbade courts in Australia from<br>recognizing same-sex marriages which had<br>been affected overseas and defining<br>marriage as the relationship between a<br>man and a woman to the exclusion of all<br>others for life and requiring that that<br>definition be read at every marriage<br>which was formalized in Australia<br>whether in a church or in a marriage<br>celebrant marriage in Australian now<br>about seventy percent of marriages<br>our solemnized in parks gardens under<br>willow trees and other such romantic<br>places and not in churches only about<br>thirty percent of marriages in Australia<br>are formalized in churches I don't know<br>what the position is in New Zealand but<br>I imagine it would be a similar<br>statistic in 2004 hot on the tails of<br>that step in the Australian Parliament<br>the Australian Capital Territory<br>legislature exercising its powers under<br>the same self-government act of that<br>territory enacted what he called a civil<br>union law this didn't purport to give<br>marriage as a status but civil union<br>providing for civil unions however the<br>Howard government opposed the<br>legislation said it was too close to<br>marriage calling it a union was<br>describing it as effectively a marriage<br>and they therefore disallowed the law<br>enacted by the acct Parliament I think<br>I'm right in saying it's the only law<br>which has been passed by the legislators<br>of the accts in self-government in 1988<br>to be disallowed by the federal<br>parliament in 2007 the human rights and<br>equal opportunity commission of<br>Australia in the face of this<br>development opened its own inquiry into<br>discrimination in Australian laws on the<br>basis of sexual orientation gender<br>identity and it came up with an<br>extremely strong report identifying 85<br>laws federal laws which it said needed<br>to be reformed in order to remove<br>discrimination against same-sex couples<br>and same-sex individuals that was placed<br>on the table of the federal parliament<br>but the Howard government still then in<br>office said that these proposals were<br>not a priority in 2007 later in the year<br>the rudd government was elected<br>and the Rudd Government very quickly<br>committed itself to amend not 67 but 200<br>federal laws in a whole range of matters<br>to remove discrimination but not the<br>marriage act the marriage act pursuant<br>to an assurance given in the election<br>was not touched in 2002 8 the a.c.t<br>legislature enacted what he thought<br>might be a civil relationship that would<br>be accepted by the rudd government<br>called a civil partnership act they took<br>out every reference to Union and called<br>the relationship of partnership and they<br>thought that that would pass muster with<br>the rudd government but observing the<br>commitment which had been given to<br>opponents of gay marriage before the<br>election Mr Rudd declined to move 2010<br>the australian labor party which had by<br>then switched to Julia Gillard adopted<br>to change their national constant<br>conscience a conference mandate to<br>commit to same-sex marriage and various<br>steps were taken in the federal<br>parliament friendly to LGBT people by<br>the Rudd and Gillard government's but<br>nothing had been done to amend the<br>marriage act when the Rudd the second<br>rudd government failed and was rejected<br>by the people in the election of 2012<br>however the a.c.t legislature would not<br>take no for an answer and it tried for a<br>third time to enact the marriage<br>equality same sex act of 2013 and its<br>reasoning was this that if the federal<br>data structure has rejected as the 2004<br>statute of mr. Howard had done the<br>possibility of a marriage under the<br>marriage power of the federal pardon<br>that still left<br>the glass-half-empty to be filled by the<br>state or territory legislature and<br>because it would not be inconsistent<br>with the territory legislature to enact<br>a form of relationship which they called<br>a marriage but only a territory marriage<br>and they said that by that means they<br>would sail between the prohibition of<br>the Federal Marriage Act and the<br>decision of the acct to provide a<br>territory marriage which was not a<br>federal marriage and not purporting to<br>be so meanwhile in May of 2015 the Irish<br>referendum was held but before that the<br>challenge was made by the Abbott<br>government to the a.c.t legislation and<br>the challenge was successful in the High<br>Court of Australia in the end of 2013<br>when the High Court said if you call it<br>a marriage equality act and if you are<br>using the word marriage and if you are<br>trying to enact a form of marriage then<br>you are intruding into the space of the<br>federal Power which has used its power<br>to forbid marriage and if a big<br>recognition of marriage and that is<br>something that a territory or a state<br>cannot do and so in Australia we reached<br>the position in the last few months<br>where attempts have been made in the<br>Australian Parliament to get a<br>conscience vote to have a vote and to<br>have a decision on the matter to get a<br>conscience vote it was necessary for the<br>coalition parties to override the<br>decision of its then leader tony abbott<br>who had said there would not be a<br>conscience vote in this Parliament the<br>attempt to do so was put to a party<br>meeting on the twelfth of August 2015<br>and that meeting voted by 6233<br>against reopening the decision of the<br>coalition not to allow a conscience vote<br>notwithstanding that a number of<br>committed coalition politician said they<br>would continue to move for a conscience<br>vote and they remind a tradition in the<br>coalition parties that members can vote<br>on conscience matters as they please and<br>that essentially is where it stands<br>except for a development that occurred<br>last week in the removal from office of<br>Prime Minister Abbott and his<br>replacement by Mr Turnbull Mr Abbott was<br>the end opposed to marriage equality in<br>same-sex marriage Mr Turnbull has for a<br>long time been a supporter of marriage<br>equality and still is however in order<br>to gain the support within the coalition<br>parties he committed himself to continue<br>the policies which had been adopted by<br>Mr Abbott namely no amendment to the<br>conscience vote and before any vote in<br>the federal parliament the conduct of a<br>clever set amongst the Australian people<br>to see whether the Australian people<br>support or do not support marriage<br>equality the history of pleb insists and<br>referenda in Australia which is an<br>exceptional procedure very very rarely<br>undertaken except for constitutional<br>matters is almost uniformly negative to<br>the proposition which is being advanced<br>and of course that was the reason why<br>this was proposed there is no need for a<br>referendum because the High Court of<br>Australia has made it clear in the acct<br>marriage case that the federal<br>parliament and the federal parliament<br>alone has the full constitutional power<br>to enact marriage equality and they went<br>to the point of specifically excluding<br>the argument that marriage<br>marriage in 1901 when the Australian<br>Constitution was adopted so that's where<br>we stand and I want now to mention very<br>quickly the ten lessons from what was<br>unimaginable fifteen years ago to a<br>point where marriage equality now at<br>least in Western societies appears to be<br>inevitable first it teaches the<br>importance of scientific research it<br>teaches the importance of social science<br>research because nothing much happened<br>in respect of human sexuality and the<br>law until the research of such scientist<br>Alfred Kinsey in the middle of the 20th<br>century it was the gathering of a great<br>deal of social science research that<br>revealed that contrary to expectations<br>LGBT people were not a tiny minority but<br>were a substantial significant minority<br>who should be respected secondly it<br>shows the way in which parallel issues<br>of discrimination happen together and<br>often in tandem discrimination on race<br>discrimination on gender discrimination<br>against indigenous people and<br>discrimination on the basis of sexuality<br>all of these are part of a paradigm of<br>removing old discriminations thirdly it<br>shows how important repeal of the<br>criminal laws was the French you see had<br>abolished their anti-gay law in 1793 in<br>the early days the French Revolution but<br>it has taken until nineteen sixty seven<br>for the UK to do it nineteen eighty six<br>for New Zealand to do it nineteen ninety<br>six for Tasmania the last state of<br>Australia to do it and 2003 for Lawrence<br>and Texas to do it in the United States<br>fourthly it shows the importance of<br>international movement in the law the<br>international movement in the<br>Netherlands for the enactment of the<br>so-called law on the opening up of<br>marriage<br>didn't come until 2000 with effect from<br>2001 so it's a very recent development<br>in the law 2000 until today is 15 years<br>and it's truly a most remarkable change<br>that has happened just looking at as<br>objectively as one can to achieve all<br>these changes in such a short space of<br>time and to achieve the sixty-two<br>percent of the Irish referendum in 2015<br>was a truly remarkable feat of citizen<br>decision-making number five is the<br>decline of the political influence of<br>the churches and there are many reasons<br>for this they include what even Pope<br>Francis has been inclined to say that<br>there's been far too much concentration<br>on sex and our bedrooms and two little<br>involvement with things that really<br>concern citizens including religious<br>citizens number six is the maturity the<br>growing maturity of the secular<br>principle in constitutional arrangements<br>secularism I think is one of the most<br>important gifts of the British they gave<br>the anti-gay law but they also gave many<br>great constitutional gifts and one of<br>them is the principle of the separation<br>of the church from the state and the<br>separation of the power and influence of<br>the church far beyond the temple and<br>that is something which has been<br>demonstrated by the votes in<br>the next six li in most jurisdictions it<br>has been an interactive procedure<br>between legislators and the Judiciary<br>it's unlikely that the Supreme Court the<br>United States would have taken the case<br>except for the fact that i think it was<br>33 states of the united states and then<br>36 by the time of the decision had made<br>legislative changes in the united states<br>and that encouraged the supreme court of<br>the united states to take the decision<br>maybe in a diverse in a perverse way or<br>different way in New Zealand the<br>decision was taken in response to<br>quilter and in response to the feeling<br>that Justice Thomas had got the analysis<br>correct as was my later consideration of<br>the matter eighth Lee there are<br>different reasons of where we've got in<br>the different countries New Zealand<br>country with a small population with a<br>legislature of a single chamber with a<br>very strong sense of community which<br>doesn't exist in large continental<br>federal countries at the United States<br>the galloping number of states which had<br>enacted marriage equality Justice Scalia<br>and Justice tow Chief Justice Thomas<br>said that should just be taken as a<br>reason to leave it to the States they<br>were doing their job but the majority<br>was at the view obviously that it<br>shouldn't be left it was a matter of<br>fundamental principle and so should be<br>changed in Australia we have no Bill of<br>Rights we had adverse political players<br>of considerable power and the religious<br>organizations continued to play a very<br>important part in AD in opposition 9th<br>Lee there is the generational shift as a<br>reason why in Western countries things<br>have changed many young people to him I<br>speak about the subject simply cannot<br>understand the opposition people want to<br>go down the path of a disastrous<br>marriage relationship why should they<br>not be able to do that like straight<br>people and on the other hand in<br>non-western countries there is a geo<br>political cultural resistance to change<br>which was often founded on notions of<br>identity and of religious instruction<br>and the tenth lesson is the timing is<br>everything timing in this matter has<br>been extremely important there are<br>people who say it is not for the people<br>the population the majority to purport<br>to override fundamental rights that that<br>belongs<br>not to the majority to dispense but to<br>the people who are most directly<br>concerned but certainly as my great<br>teacher in law school in jurisprudence<br>who was once the Dean of law at the<br>University of Auckland Julius stone<br>whose portrait is found just outside the<br>dean's office so that he can be reminded<br>every day of what a great lawyer Julia<br>Stone his predecessor was and be<br>inspired by his presence stone thought<br>although is having ly ways for choice<br>they have leave ways for choice in the<br>words of statutes in the words of<br>constitutions and in policy decisions<br>which are made under important<br>legislation and those leave ways for<br>choice have to be recognized and seized<br>here is the washington post on the day<br>after the Supreme Court of the United<br>States announced its decision gays right<br>to Wed affirmed jubilation for many but<br>day takes bittersweet turn for some and<br>the white house in the background you'll<br>see is colored in the rainbow colors<br>President Obama having been a belated<br>but ultimately a strong supporter for<br>marriage equality in that country and so<br>I leave this saga as a story that is as<br>yet incomplete in my own country it is<br>incomplete because it hasn't yet been<br>achieved in Australia but more<br>importantly it is incomplete because in<br>52 of rather in 42 of 54 countries of<br>the call you we're not talking about<br>marriage we're talking about cool<br>violence hatred and violence physical<br>violence against people who are LGBTIQ<br>and<br>it behooves all of us who live in<br>peaceful countries which live under the<br>rule of law to seek to advance equality<br>for all not just for gays not just for<br>gays but for everybody so that there is<br>no discrimination against people on the<br>grounds of race on the grounds of gender<br>on the grounds of sexuality or any other<br>irrational ground and in due course that<br>will be achieved and much has been<br>achieved in the last 15 years remarkably<br>much has been achieved and in New<br>Zealand you have been in the lead on<br>many of these issues so thank you for<br>allowing me to give this lecture and in<br>due course on the demand of the dean who<br>is voracious in his demands for my<br>activities and on the demand of the of<br>the Auckland University Law Review I<br>will reduce it to writing and it would<br>be available for all who are interested</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
