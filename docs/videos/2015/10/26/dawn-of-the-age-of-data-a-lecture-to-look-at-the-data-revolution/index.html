my name is Neil<br>quickly i'm the vice chancellor of the<br>university it's my pleasure to welcome<br>you here this evening to this inaugural<br>professorial lecture this is a series of<br>lectures in which we showcase the work<br>of the new professors in the university<br>provide them with an opportunity to tell<br>their colleagues and members of the<br>wider community about the work that<br>they're doing and of course the work<br>that provided the foundation for their<br>promotion to Professor tonight we're<br>acknowledging bernhard far as promotion<br>to professor in the Faculty of computing<br>and mathematical sciences burn of the<br>course is very well known to his<br>colleagues having been head of the<br>computer science department since 2013<br>Bernard completed his undergraduate<br>study in 1985 and his PhD in 1995 both<br>at the vienna university of technology<br>his thesis was entitled practical uses<br>of the minimum description length<br>principle in inductive learning the<br>thesis tried to provide answers to the<br>following conundrum simple models are<br>easy to understand but often not<br>accurate enough complex models are much<br>harder to understand but tend to be much<br>more accurate minimum description length<br>offers well-founded ways to strike a<br>balance between these two conflicting<br>goals in empirical analysis in 1996<br>bernhard left Austria and came to the<br>University of Waikato for a year as a<br>postdoctoral research fellow in the<br>machine learning group he then returned<br>to Austria to work at the Austria<br>research institute for artificial<br>intelligence until joining the<br>university of what cut of staff in 2000<br>it was promoted to associate professor<br>in 2007 his area of expertise is machine<br>learning and data mining which is the<br>computational process of discovering<br>patterns in data involving methods at<br>the intersection of artificial<br>intelligence statistics and database<br>systems as a computer scientist he is<br>always building evaluating and improving<br>tools for this task the most recent tool<br>is the development of the massive online<br>analysis data stream mining open source<br>software suite mo a massive online<br>analysis is the most popular open source<br>framework for data stream mining it<br>includes a collection of machine<br>learning algorithms and tools for<br>evaluation MOA is a younger cousin to<br>wicker workout an environment for<br>knowledge analysis specialising in data<br>stream mining traditional methods<br>struggle in such scenarios or are simply<br>not efficient enough burnet has edited<br>three books published 20 journal<br>articles and journals such as the<br>machine learning journal and the Journal<br>of machine learning research he received<br>a Marsden grant from 2003 to 2006 it was<br>the associate prevent proof that the<br>sorry the associate principal<br>investigator for to foundation for<br>research science and technology grants<br>won a build IT grant for a postdoctoral<br>research fellow to work with them and<br>professor Jerry Holmes on data stream<br>mining and has sourced multiple PhD<br>scholarships for his PhD students<br>Bernard is also a member of the local<br>machine learning research group that won<br>the 2005 sig kdd data mining and<br>knowledge discovery service award for<br>its wicked data mining platform ladies<br>and gentleman please join me in<br>coming to the lectern for his inaugural<br>professorial lecture professor bernhard<br>fahringer<br>good evening Thank You Vice Chancellor<br>thank you Jeff hello everybody<br>colleagues friends students Hamiltonians<br>the theme for this evening is the dawn<br>of the age of data so what I want to do<br>is actually not just going to talk about<br>my own work but take a little step back<br>and first of all kind of give you a<br>little bit of background about myself so<br>they get a better understanding of why<br>I'm coming from and then want you to<br>reflect on the amazing times we're<br>living in and just mention a few things<br>that I really obvious once you see them<br>but you never think about them and take<br>them for granted so hopefully there's<br>something in there that's interesting<br>for everyone it won't be very technical<br>so if your computer science student<br>maybe get a little bit bored but maybe<br>it's a good review as well for you okay<br>so let's start with myself I don't speak<br>Maori but I really like the way you<br>introduce yourself in the Maori context<br>and so I've decided to do that with the<br>first few slides so this is my Mountain<br>this is an amazing number of mountains<br>in winter to go skiing like for instance<br>this is my laser pointer this is key<br>field here just on top of the city and<br>if you're lucky if school finishes early<br>you can go skiing after school so it's<br>brilliant the kid to live there now this<br>is my river this is an interesting rule<br>because I got a funny color it's usually<br>grayish or green and this is because<br>there's a lot of glaciers around and you<br>basically fall the sediment that comes<br>from dead and as you can see in some of<br>those less snow on the mountains but the<br>wettest kind of variable it's a bit like<br>Queen Stan probably without the lake but<br>much bigger motor size of Hamilton maybe<br>even little bit bigger these days now<br>this is my tripe<br>when they dress them up in the<br>traditional clothing which is actually<br>quite colorful and probably most of you<br>will be reminded of oktoberfest which is<br>in Germany but this is Austria but it's<br>very close to Germany and so there's a<br>lot of similarities between south of<br>Germany and Austria including the<br>traditional clothes and if you kind of<br>focus more on the more local aspect so<br>this is my habbo this is the place I'm<br>really from innsbrook if we're having a<br>good time we can have that in summer in<br>winter there's a lot of stuff happening<br>there and like around the river you can<br>have big parties or you have nice<br>fireworks at times and all stuff like<br>that so this is where I grew up this is<br>where I initially even went to<br>university for one year because when I<br>finished high school I wasn't really<br>sure what I should study and it was a<br>couple of options like some Sciences<br>were on the list of biology and<br>chemistry or maybe math and computer<br>science when I made this decision well<br>in innsbrook you could do math with a<br>minor in computer science why not give<br>that a go and I liked it so much that I<br>decided computers I shouldn't be a minor<br>it should be a major but at that stage<br>you couldn't do that in innsbrook so I<br>had a big move I moved to Vienna and<br>back then in the ninth early 1980s and<br>australis is like a big thing because<br>even the language is different there a<br>very different way of speaking German in<br>Vienna dental ins progresses maybe move<br>from Invercargill to Auckland if you<br>won't get a comparison and there are<br>multiple universities there this one is<br>a technical university which is I think<br>ranked in the two hundreds so it's not<br>in the 100's but it's a good place and<br>if this nice old building from the times<br>of the Emperor but this of course modern<br>buildings around as well and if some<br>really good programs including computer<br>science and this is where I spend my<br>undergrad status end and later on also<br>did my PhD now the real cool thing about<br>that was<br>the opportunity in 1984 someone 1984 I<br>got this offer to be a summer student at<br>CERN the cernus is a European Center for<br>a nuclear and physics research that is<br>on the border between Switzerland and<br>France in Geneva close to Geneva and<br>actually quite interesting in the way<br>that so this bit here is Switzerland and<br>over here is France and certain itself<br>is x2 actually extraterritorial just<br>great because they don't pay taxes I<br>could keep all my money and he had a<br>good thing is that back then there were<br>border controls there was like really<br>strict controls here but if you were<br>working at CERN you could get in here<br>and exit over here on the French side<br>without any controls so I was based here<br>in this building that you probably would<br>call a data center these days because<br>physicists collect enormous amounts of<br>data really some mind-boggling numbers<br>of sight and even back then for the 30<br>years ago they had this huge<br>installations use of the whole basement<br>there was basically for storage and I'll<br>explain in a minute the interesting<br>thing for me there was also my first<br>language issue there was not this area's<br>french-speaking that was reasonably okay<br>it was my supervisor he was Scottish and<br>the first two weeks I had a really hard<br>time because he was really Scottish like<br>he was practicing bagpipe playing with<br>three of his Scott's friends every<br>monday at 5pm in this parking lot<br>marching up and down and ever ever knew<br>about that because you hear them for<br>kilometers now sign is brilliant if your<br>computer scientist or maybe just a geek<br>because those physicists have money and<br>they need good computing infrastructure<br>so they always have the latest gear but<br>back then in nineteen eighty-four they<br>had this one of the things they had was<br>this IBM mass storage system MSS 472<br>gigabytes which doesn't sound much these<br>days but back then it was big thing so<br>just a given idea this was the basement<br>was<br>filled with Rex that kind of looked like<br>this here that is like a beehive and you<br>have less like a coke can so the cans in<br>there and inside every can is about 20<br>meters of tape with capacitor 50<br>megabytes and for this amount of data<br>need about ten thousand card which is<br>there was about a hundred of those in<br>the basement and there's little robotic<br>like things that actually retrieve those<br>put them in the reader and you copy them<br>in the hard drive and then you can<br>actually run new program now just a<br>given idea how big that was in<br>comparison to what was the norm then in<br>the same year this computer was released<br>and I'm sure you have seen that before<br>and maybe you have had one or used one<br>before so I was only one of those<br>slightly later model at some stage this<br>was eight megahertz this was 128<br>kilobytes of RAM and it didn't have any<br>hard drive or stuff like that it just<br>had a floppy disk of four hundred<br>kilobytes four hundred verses funny<br>gigabytes but as orders of magnitude in<br>between and a very tiny screen and click<br>and white only but this gets us through<br>what I want to explain to you what has<br>happened and which you may not have<br>noticed there's kind of a revolution<br>going on but it's kind of incremental<br>and Gretel enough that we don't really<br>know this so the first revolution is<br>what I would call the hardware<br>revolution now this is an amazing<br>computer that you see up there it may<br>not look like a computer to you but it<br>is and it's only like marginally phone<br>as well in my point of view if you look<br>at its properties it had three hundred<br>and twenty thousand times as much<br>storage capacity then this little old<br>computer or in other words four of those<br>iphones would replace the basement of<br>cern in 1984 so the whole basement<br>basically you could store it in four of<br>those iphones and of course excess will<br>be much fast as well you wouldn't have<br>the robot picking the can and it takes<br>like a couple of minutes to read stuff<br>in in addition to that you get much more<br>working memory you get a much<br>screen exactly touch screen and you get<br>all these other stuff you get cameras<br>not just one but two you get GPS you can<br>accelerometer you actually have the<br>ability to pay like with a credit card<br>you have apps for everything there's not<br>just browsing the internet with Safari<br>or Chrome or whatever if dedicated apps<br>as well for anything you can wish for<br>and if it's out there yet you just talk<br>to us and we will implement it so there<br>was a hardware revolution then the other<br>thing that happened over the last thirty<br>uses what's called the network<br>revolution in 1984 there was no World<br>Wide Web there was kind of a predecessor<br>of the internet and something like<br>emails and the world like very low level<br>capabilities for a select few people<br>working at universities and some<br>research institutions it wasn't<br>something anyone would be using every<br>day then in 1989 and that's just a<br>coincidence that happened at CERN as<br>well it was kind of the birth of the<br>world wide web and you've probably all<br>heard the name Tim berners-lee before<br>but 10 years later the now prominent<br>search engine started it wasn't the<br>first one but it was just so much better<br>than all the eternities at that stage<br>that basically blow them away and they<br>skepta the market ever since and still<br>has a large percentage of the market and<br>then in the 2000s we saw something that<br>we hadn't seen before something<br>completely new social networks and again<br>they're not the first ones there was<br>others before like for facebook in New<br>Zealand's and it was very popular with<br>teenagers was people and some of you in<br>the audience might have used it yourself<br>you still student and then 2006 we got<br>Twitter 2009 world wats app and that all<br>had interesting consequences but I think<br>the main thing and this is the thing<br>that we don't really see that easily<br>usually is that we've turned and<br>returning everything into digital and<br>this is I think the real revolution this<br>is<br>what makes this century very different<br>from the past so my claim is that well<br>history books and a few hundred years<br>you will read something about that this<br>was the century where with intent<br>digital and where it was really a sea<br>change and the consequences of that is<br>that if it's digital you can easily<br>store it like on these drives on your<br>phone wherever and then once it's stored<br>it's also easy to analyze it but this is<br>where our speciality comes in with data<br>mining and machine learning now can<br>thrive on all the dotted it's there and<br>I think an interesting observation there<br>is that there was no master plan behind<br>that that has just happened it's mainly<br>hadn't are because of convenience and<br>also because of interesting business<br>ideas so if you're not convinced it i'm<br>going to show you a number of examples<br>to try to convince you it's really<br>amazing how everything is now digital<br>and when I prepare those slides I will<br>surprise myself at some stage so first<br>of all photos you take pictures and<br>we've all been taking pictures but back<br>then 1980s or so you have a camera he<br>had film it took a few pictures he went<br>to the chemist ahead and process then<br>you stick them into a like album like<br>that or if you had slides maybe you do a<br>projection but usually had one copy of a<br>picture anyway actually these copies<br>were pretty good because they last<br>pretty long and unless you move house<br>and lose your album usually they would<br>be lasting for decades now all of that<br>has been replaced basically by digital<br>cameras if you still have a dedicated<br>camera or by phone Steph cameras and the<br>price is also amazing if you think about<br>it like dedicated digital cameras small<br>ones you can get for a few hundred<br>dollars and they are even waterproof so<br>you can snorkel and film while you do<br>that something that's what unthinkable<br>30 years ago you would have to spend a<br>lot of money on really professional gear<br>to be able to do that<br>and the quality that we get these days<br>is even better and so you get sites like<br>Flickr or Facebook where you have all<br>your pictures if you have your mobile<br>phone set up the right way might even be<br>the case that you take depictions<br>automatically upload it it's one word of<br>caution here everything digital may not<br>last that long so if you only have a<br>copy on a hard drive and the hard drive<br>might last five years or ten years and<br>then it's dead you've lost the copy so i<br>always make backups of everything that's<br>important to you like your family<br>pictures or your phone because if all is<br>a computer and its back up like you<br>compute with us if you value the content<br>on your phone and i suppose you should<br>so that was photos navigation at example<br>we'll use maps printed maps trying to<br>find our way around foreign cities or<br>the map might have been out of date by<br>five years and we get stuck and it's not<br>good fun these days it's very easy like<br>you have this GPS like this sexy in<br>Tokyo or you just use google apps on<br>your phone and it's brilliant because<br>first of all it's usually correct<br>because it's usually updated in real<br>time and it might even be better than<br>the map because it might know about<br>conditions like that when the roadworks<br>ahead so you might it might write you<br>around and also it's much easier to<br>follow the orders by a machine than the<br>backseat driver right so this is an<br>amazing step forward money we use the<br>youth coins and notes all the time I bet<br>in this audience at least twenty percent<br>of you wouldn't have a single coil note<br>on you today maybe even more because you<br>Selah is actually one of the very<br>advanced countries in their regard where<br>a lot of things around money have moved<br>to being online already so what we have<br>these days is this of course and you<br>have F post or ready cards basically<br>it's also advantages like if you lose<br>your card well you talk to your bank to<br>cancel it and you get a new one you<br>don't necessarily lose any money if you<br>lose a thousand dollars<br>he gone for good so it's really good<br>also because of this things changed like<br>I remember once in my life I was<br>actually carrying probably the<br>equivalent of 15,000 new zealand dollars<br>on me by basically going to bank to make<br>a deposit for an apartment these days<br>they will be crazy you wouldn't do that<br>probably if you have that a modification<br>communication ah good old letter box<br>there when was the last time you wrote a<br>letter and I don't mean I'm filling out<br>a form that we were asked to fill out<br>for some government department of<br>whatever really a letter to a friend or<br>for the younger ones they may have never<br>done that actually or phones like good<br>old phone boxes there's still phone<br>boxes around but telecom is repurposing<br>them as hive Wi-Fi hotspots so these<br>days well actually that's interesting<br>because it's also already more like<br>dying technology text messages we're<br>very interesting because they were kind<br>of an afterthought but they were really<br>successful and up until maybe five years<br>ago they were really easy and cheap form<br>of communication like our emails like<br>Gmail or other providers but emails<br>again have replaced letters but they're<br>not very like fashionable anymore so<br>they're used by old people and by people<br>running businesses so I use email a lot<br>like the way I work is run through email<br>and even my to-do list is basically my<br>inbox and but for my students I have I<br>really have a hard time making sure that<br>they actually read their emails because<br>they're not really used to that anymore<br>there's fast the channels of<br>communication so twitter is kind of more<br>public but there's more private<br>messaging like whatsapp is a very<br>popular application that has probably<br>replaced text messages a nice feature<br>about whatsapp is that it's<br>international so with your text message<br>in New Zealand it may be free but if you<br>want<br>text someone in austria from here that<br>may be a dollars of a simple text<br>message with whatsapp well there's no<br>cost so that's brilliant okay next area<br>well if we already have social network<br>so i just want to mention facebook<br>because they're really dominant and<br>twitter and another one linkedin because<br>it's really useful network for<br>professional purposes these are kind of<br>the global ones generic ones there's a<br>lot of specialized networks for lots of<br>different things so for instance if your<br>researcher you might have profile on<br>researchgate and a lot of one called<br>academia.edu and there's specialist<br>networks for a lot of purposes these<br>days now information and knowledge the<br>weight shared will used to be printed<br>like newspapers books you go to the<br>library that has stopped basically even<br>I myself sometimes tends to be with<br>old-fashioned in the room in this area<br>and I've been going to the library<br>regularly probably longer than many but<br>I probably haven't been to our library<br>in at least two years or three well<br>everything's online now so newspapers<br>but also scientific journals ebooks are<br>very useful thing because if you want to<br>go someplace don't want to carry like 50<br>kgs of books year 1 500 gram ebook<br>reader and you have thousands of books<br>on it wikipedia has basically put the<br>protein encyclopedia britannica out of<br>business printing encyclopedias doesn't<br>make sense anymore it's all online I<br>problem with online is finding things it<br>can be very easy because we have<br>excellent search engines now like Ruby<br>being by do but you have to be very<br>focused you need to know what you're<br>looking for like browsing and the<br>business discovery is not really<br>supported that well and this is maybe<br>where librarians still have a function<br>these days but also there's something<br>which is called recommender systems<br>which tries to kind of help you in that<br>area it's not perfect yet it's pretty<br>good but it could be better okay I'm<br>finished yet there's still more and<br>there's many more I think of a few more<br>here audio and video of<br>course YouTube big one Netflix more of a<br>business and netflix has really captured<br>the market that I estimates that in the<br>US on any like weekday evening 30 to 40<br>percent of all the internet traffic art<br>is generated by streaming videos through<br>netflix that's basically this company<br>almost monopolizing the use of the<br>internet in the US every evening you<br>think about it is just crazy Spotify so<br>radio radio is interesting because radio<br>stations actually still survive and this<br>is probably because radio is an<br>interesting medium video you need to<br>focus on it you need to watch it radio<br>is kind of like you can do reasonable<br>stuff you can work on something it's<br>loffredo in the background so radio is<br>still popular with all the radio<br>stations now have online channels as<br>well and you see more and more services<br>that just dream music like Spotify and<br>others i mentioned Spotify is probably<br>the most well known one another thing<br>that hopefully you have heard of and if<br>not really go there and check it out Ted<br>is amazing Ted calm this is a collection<br>of talks on technology entertainment and<br>design from across the world that Ted<br>events that usually run for a day and we<br>also have them here New Zealand now<br>there's a regular one in Auckland we had<br>one in hamilton in june and i think<br>that's going to be repeat it if you have<br>a chance to at least if you're bored if<br>you don't know what to do go to dead<br>calm and watch a random movie there it's<br>going to be good this is an interesting<br>one personally for me because this<br>slider added just yesterday almost as an<br>afterthought they're completely<br>forgotten about it from which is Josie<br>there don't spend much time shopping but<br>of course this is really big like Amazon<br>everyone has used it before and there's<br>local equivalent was actually doing<br>pretty well or for secondhand stuff does<br>ebay internationally and we have trade<br>me here and they're really good and it's<br>convenient and it's excellent to have<br>and it has completely replaced what we<br>I'd like on paper before oops there was<br>wrong look what's up here this is<br>interesting maybe just restarted yep<br>always works ok so my claim is that as I<br>said the something that has<br>fundamentally changed and it's a really<br>huge change even though you may not<br>notice that and so I think it's really<br>similar to when we as humanity we came<br>out of the medieval ages into the area<br>of enlightenment the Renaissance area<br>and so decides some really famous<br>physicist from the derry-o galileo<br>galilei what did they do is scientists<br>well you won't measure what you can<br>measure and all the other stuff you want<br>to make measurable to further science<br>now the same thing is happening with the<br>chili sation so we have a lot of digital<br>things already you should be convinced<br>by now we can store and analyze that but<br>we also need to and we do that actively<br>digitize what's not digital yet ok<br>that's going pretty good so and now<br>finally actually comes to wear can where<br>do I come in what's my sub area what's<br>my specific sub field in computer<br>science well I'm going to use the term<br>data mining and machine learning<br>interchangeably here there's enough of<br>you in the audience to know that this is<br>not Hannibal's incorrect please bear<br>with me but I think the distinctions are<br>kind of blurred anyway already so<br>basically what we do is we look at the<br>store data and we try to find some<br>interesting information in there and<br>usually that means some patterns that<br>are recurring in some way and they don't<br>necessarily have to be frequent if they<br>are interesting and this is good for two<br>purposes so we want to understand the<br>data or better understand the data but<br>also we want to be able to predict at<br>times at least won't be able to predict<br>and if you look at this for<br>it has grown organically with important<br>number of different fields and mainly<br>mathematics statistics and computer<br>science so it's kind of perfect being<br>effectively the cows executive three<br>subjects and those of other Maddox's of<br>the Malaysians mainly important in the<br>bureau sciences two very distinct<br>subfields artificial intelligence and<br>databases personally I come from the<br>artificial intelligence and they also<br>explains some of my prejudices probably<br>and approaches and I've just tried to<br>give you an idea here what it is to be a<br>computer scientist let's lower<br>simplification but I think it captures<br>it to some degree so basically what we<br>do is we invent and build and analyze<br>and improve algorithms and programs when<br>algorithm is like the recipe like you<br>ever loved a recipe so we write for<br>flour recipes then you have a lot of<br>crooks who cooked up of Lobos according<br>to the recipe but the outcomes are all<br>different robo flow goes to some degree<br>with slight differences so the same<br>algorithm can be implemented by<br>different programs and have different<br>specific properties and it makes it<br>interesting they love diversity there so<br>in a way being a computer scientist is<br>like being a tool Smith with the<br>ultimate tool maker because you can turn<br>your computer into anything you want you<br>can imagine it you can make it happen<br>and with that I want to give you some<br>light-hearted entertainment for two<br>minutes I'm sure some of you recognized<br>is already but if not then you probably<br>haven't seen this movie from 1968 so<br>it's actually a long time ago almost for<br>most 15 years so this is you forage<br>around you look for ideas you have some<br>colleagues around they don't actually<br>communicate that much then you find<br>something interesting something like a<br>center Buddhist discovery you have<br>closer look<br>there's light bulb moment that's<br>brilliant we get one every year you<br>really really happy about that they have<br>a very close look and then suddenly<br>dawns on you that what you've seen for a<br>long time actually you can make<br>connections to other things that you've<br>seen before and combine them in new ways<br>or use them in new ways so you pick up<br>investigate a little bit further and to<br>okay so even you two of course the<br>problem with it totally some once you<br>have one tool like a hammer everything<br>looks like a nail right and this is a<br>little bit the danger that we have to<br>live with now talking about tools I want<br>to introduce you the first tool of this<br>evening which is Weka which has been<br>mentioned before which is really well<br>known around the world which is actually<br>Ian bitten sprained jail but also I be<br>frank and Mark Hall have done a lot of<br>work around that so instantly professor<br>with us he was only partly retired I was<br>an associate professor Mark Hall used to<br>be a lecturer but is working for a<br>company that provides a commercial<br>support for wake up and it's an<br>interesting tidbit that that company has<br>been bought and larger company this year<br>and I'm sure it's going to be some<br>announcement at some stage later this<br>year than yours you've made a little bit<br>of money out of that as well so even<br>though we make our software really<br>available as free open-source software<br>you can still get some money out of it<br>it's as I said being used a lot<br>especially for education but also<br>applications there's also this so-called<br>MOOC so you're going to learn a little<br>few abbreviations this evening like<br>false free open source software MOOCs<br>massive online open online courses so<br>you can learn on your own pace if you<br>want to and if you don't have the time<br>to enroll in university course they've<br>written this nice book waker was<br>basically the reason I came here because<br>there's the machine learning group this<br>build around this tool and there was<br>really the attraction for me to come to<br>New Zealand from a professional point of<br>view it was sat in the mid-90s I came<br>here in two thousand so I'm not one of<br>the main people but I've contributed my<br>fair share with the years by section<br>small number of classes where I'm one of<br>the authors of the codes I've done some<br>programming for it I think more<br>importantly of supervise students who<br>have contributed some of my grant money<br>has helped to finance support for it and<br>so on so forth so using this tool what I<br>want to do now is<br>I'm not just the research i'm also a<br>lecture so i want to teach you one thing<br>today i want to tell you about to data<br>mining methods and i want to explain one<br>in more detail because that's very<br>simple and useful one it's called<br>decision trees and to do that we're<br>going to look at a very simple data set<br>that's brilliant in a way it's the<br>passengers of the Titanic and trying to<br>find out who has survived who hasn't and<br>can we find some explanations for that<br>now if you google for bad on that you<br>will see this an awful amount of money<br>information on the internet mainly<br>because of the successful movies so some<br>nice folk have made the starter<br>available where we look at about 1300<br>patients and we have a lot of<br>information about them so anonymized is<br>no names anymore but we know the<br>passenger class or the three classes one<br>two and three the male of female their<br>age and this is a well child of 11 month<br>probably that's a funny points 0.91 the<br>number of siblings that may surprise you<br>but ever quite a lot of families on<br>board the number of parents so lots of<br>people didn't left a parent like a<br>regular passenger but if you're a child<br>you may have wanted to parents<br>everything with you the cabin number<br>when it was known and whether you<br>survived or not now if you analyze start<br>it's always good to look at it and when<br>I say look I mean visualizing the data<br>so Becca has a number of different ways<br>to do a very simple one is this one<br>where you just basically look at for all<br>the features that you have how do they<br>correlate the values of those features<br>correlate to the outcome so the outcome<br>is our survival so we have 500 survivors<br>and we have about 800 people who drowned<br>so this looks bad Sumlin passengers for<br>the career was even worse though I think<br>the survival percentage for approvals<br>less than fifteen percent but for the<br>passengers what you see is well as maybe<br>not much difference between first and<br>second class but definitely in third<br>class many more of the third-class<br>passengers drowned as we look at this is<br>female this is male well many of the<br>females survived but many<br>of the male's drowned H is not so clear<br>even throw here like this probably<br>around maybe eight years or ten years<br>it's actually quite a lot of children<br>also drowned usually would think of<br>women and children first and it may be<br>true for the room but maybe not for<br>children in this case and then right now<br>is probably not much we can say about<br>siblings and parents here there's a real<br>big number of where we don't have a<br>number for the cabin so this is a value<br>of zero and then there's a lot of<br>different and there's an interesting<br>fact that I didn't know about their<br>technique before they actually had three<br>harvests but silence have him in England<br>moved over the France of shampoo and<br>then back to Ireland the Queenstown and<br>so depending on where you bought it you<br>can see that this may be similar<br>percentages but here this is Queen star<br>in Ireland a lot of those<br>percentage-wise actually drowned and we<br>can ask why there may be an explanation<br>for that in a minute so decision tree is<br>some of you may have seen decision trees<br>like in biology before like an old books<br>where you look at some feature like it's<br>got sick legs as an insecticide likes a<br>spider and you can kind of go further<br>into more detail now here we have our<br>programs that look through the data and<br>basically try to set up such a tree by<br>looking at what's the most useful<br>feature and let's use it to split that<br>are in the two subsets first so in this<br>case programs picked up on being female<br>or male and if this unfortunately maybe<br>not very intuitive but basically what it<br>says is generally if you're female you<br>had a good chance of survival and there<br>were four hundred sixty six females on<br>board and all of them survived except<br>for 127 so these are the exceptions over<br>here for the males it's a much worse<br>picture on average you did not survive<br>you drowned there were 843 males but out<br>of those angles 61 still survived so<br>these are the exceptions to the general<br>rule the rule says you would drown but<br>if you had some lucky actually survived<br>now we can take that<br>by adding more levels or finer<br>distinctions maybe get more interesting<br>patterns so our algorithm thought after<br>angles really just the Machine deciding<br>that all by itself decides that for the<br>female branch we're going to look at the<br>passenger class and if the first or<br>second class passengers had a very good<br>chance of survival thus 250 of them and<br>all but 17 survived if you were a third<br>class unfortunately the picture doesn't<br>look so good for you I was 216 and 110<br>around 106th survive so it's about 50-50<br>chance of your third class on the male<br>side systems decide we look at Kevin<br>numbers if you don't have a cabin number<br>then you probably did not survive you<br>have one yahoo did not survive so it<br>looks odd but the reason we're there is<br>actually the percentages are very<br>different if you don't have a cabin<br>number then you had a high chance of<br>drowning if you had one then your chance<br>of survival is up to forty percent for<br>60 out of hundred fifty and we can go on<br>and on and on add one more level trace<br>the Big Sur I'm looking at the left-hand<br>side only at one more level now<br>something interesting happens because i<br>asked the system they add one more level<br>well it refused here and here because<br>from the system point of view we don't<br>have enough data to actually look at a<br>more fine-grained distinction and those<br>notes look pretty good enough already so<br>there's a 944 one's only five exceptions<br>or here is reset with our 21 so the<br>system stops not looking at all that I'm<br>trying to make sense out of it something<br>machine can't do we can give you the<br>patterns and then you might start<br>looking at it and thinking can I find<br>some explanations and the main<br>explanation is the third class thing<br>third class is at the bottom of the ship<br>and so it's the hardest place to get out<br>to the lifeboats and you can see that<br>very clearly that if you're in third<br>class your chances are pretty slim<br>especially if you're male but even for<br>women and children and then also if you<br>look at like the distant distribution of<br>3rd class were mainly people immigrating<br>from Europe<br>us rest first and second-class<br>passengers were either really tourists<br>especially first class or more like<br>middle class professionals that had to<br>go to the US for whatever reason so this<br>gives us some challenging thing that you<br>need to observe here even so it says<br>strict yes or no it's not realistic just<br>in the ones I was qualified by these<br>numbers which you can turn into<br>percentages it's in a way our systems<br>like a politician you won't get a<br>straight yes or no answer it's always<br>qualified with something yeah it's a<br>seventy percent or 50 or whatever so you<br>might want to ask how good is our three<br>actually and we have methods to evaluate<br>that and in this case you get an<br>estimate of about eighty percent so it<br>gets eighty percent of the correction<br>predictions right and for this data set<br>I've driver with a lot of different<br>algorithms because there's many<br>different algorithms and they're all<br>about this number there may be 81 82 but<br>there's no way you can improve because<br>it just don't have enough information<br>you would need more fine grained<br>information it's not interesting pattern<br>that someone found this not just the<br>class which relates to the level in the<br>ship but also the section so in the<br>middle section apparently is where most<br>people perished and you can deduce it<br>from the cabin numbers but unfortunately<br>are not many cabin numbers known so it's<br>been unclear but it is actually really<br>effect so just the summary trees look<br>like that the proliant because you can<br>look at them you can understand them<br>they can work with numbers and with<br>nominal values they can kind of combine<br>different things like if you're female<br>and you're born in class was first or<br>second then you survive so it's really<br>cool to have they fast or generate<br>because for one level you go through all<br>the data ones so here we have four<br>levels we go through it out of four<br>times and we're done it's brilliant<br>there's not a very useful and successful<br>class volumes called neural networks<br>that kind of the opposite they're really<br>slow so to train them you have to go<br>through the other hundreds maybe even<br>thousands of times but also it's worth<br>it because they give you good results<br>they're kind of like black boxes that<br>are inspired by the brain but don't<br>really like work like<br>the brain so you would have your inputs<br>here like the passenger class at your<br>age and the number of siblings and then<br>you have awaited some of those and some<br>weird function happening here we called<br>it a hidden layer at newer on new unlike<br>thing then you have outputs of those and<br>you can recombine them again with<br>different weights and have another<br>interesting mathematical function<br>happening then you have some outputs<br>like you predict whether the probability<br>of survival or you can have multiple<br>outputs like if this is that about<br>patients that come into an ICU you might<br>have as inputs down there the heart rate<br>and temperature and all kind of other<br>things and you might predict at a<br>survival probability but also how long<br>you will stay in hospital how many<br>liters of infusions they will need all<br>kind of things these were really very<br>popular in the 1980s and a lot of my<br>friends that we're starting at the same<br>time actually focus on that I made a<br>career out of it but then we have a bit<br>more quiet around them for various<br>reasons mainly computational resistible<br>as I said it went way too slow another<br>data was a bit of an issue now they've<br>seen a really strong renaissance the<br>last three or four years for a couple of<br>reasons but mainly because of a few<br>interesting new algorithmic ideas and<br>just a hardware has become so much<br>better so the algorithms give you a<br>factor of 10 the hardware gives you a<br>factor of 10,000 or maybe 100,000 if you<br>combine that you get a million now you<br>can do things that you were just not<br>feasible before you can work with really<br>large network so I have not just two<br>layers you have 20 layers and you have<br>them really wide like hundreds of<br>thousands of units and you feed millions<br>of example through it and what that<br>means is that you learn all those<br>weights so there's going to be millions<br>of weights from a statistical point of<br>view that sounds not impossible you<br>would all fit but no with the new L<br>grooms it works it works really well and<br>so in a way this is new buzzword deep<br>learning and it's steep because it's<br>networks are deep because they have so<br>many layers and there's really caught on<br>last few years okay<br>oops now my claim is trees and neural<br>networks are the best albums that we<br>have currently how do we know well we do<br>know because the web page is like these<br>web page he had organized competitions<br>that you can take part in and you can<br>actually win some money like it's a<br>hundred thousand dollars up there so<br>serious money and you have thousands of<br>teams competing in all kind of different<br>things usually accompanies the ones of a<br>problem but also it may be like data<br>from CERN again here about physics and<br>if you look at that who wins well the<br>winners it for the money they have to<br>not just hand over the l room but also<br>write a description that's published you<br>look at it image tasks anything with<br>pictures your networks win anything else<br>huge assembles not just single trees<br>there okay if you combine them in<br>interesting ways you get the winners and<br>that's just what happens all the other<br>albums interesting from a scientific<br>point of view lot of applications these<br>are the two that you need to focus on<br>not just very quickly I like this<br>example I use it every year in my AI<br>paper I google for myself for images<br>because it shows you how bad that is<br>goodie for Texas brilliant could be very<br>much this is bad because yes some images<br>up there for myself if you look at being<br>at just one bad Mouse go get some of the<br>pictures you may be able to explain like<br>them maybe call those are people who<br>work at Waikato University but half the<br>people I have no idea who they are why<br>are they up there there will be<br>brilliant if we had a function like<br>click on it that Google explains to you<br>why thinks this is a picture of me<br>unfortunate doesn't they know that this<br>is all bad and so they've hired this<br>machine learning people these neural<br>network experts to work on it there's a<br>little kind of waikato angle here<br>there's this guy that some of you may<br>know Shane leg he bodies you see in<br>mething a pittance here from Waikato in<br>the early nineteen ninety-seven and<br>Auckland and switzerland HD and so on so<br>forth so the company is to add a very<br>smart people in the UK and lastly google<br>bought that company for an amazing<br>amount<br>and they basically work on deep networks<br>so what does Shane think about all that<br>well just listen carefully right that's<br>just completely enough now yeah you must<br>have gotten probably a nice chunk of the<br>billion ok now next tool that's really<br>quote my tool but not just everything's<br>teamwork and i'll show the team in a<br>minute so that was also mentioned before<br>more are we like tinley use names of<br>native birds and it took us a long time<br>to actually come up with something that<br>we can claim is what more is pre v8 it<br>for so it's merciful an analysis of<br>analytics we kind of changed it now<br>because of marketing reasons it's a very<br>targeted system for a very specific<br>problem with all the data that we<br>collect if we collected over time it has<br>interesting properties one of the most<br>important one is it changes and be able<br>to deal with change you have to do<br>specific things anymore that's all<br>building in that kids not as easy you<br>can do in a wrecker but more is more<br>targeted and better fit for it again<br>like wrecker it's free open-source you<br>can download it we have Java we don't<br>have a MOOC yet maybe will happen you<br>don't have a book yet but we're writing<br>one and it can still fully and operate<br>with Iker so if you used to wake up<br>became always pretty easy just people<br>there so what's my point to go on this<br>gentleman here which are correct we<br>started off with his PhD it was co<br>supervised by me and by Jeff and he<br>finished it we make it open source and<br>this guy picks it up at that stage she<br>was a puzzle in Barcelona is a<br>this tomb frustrated with his software<br>that it was available to him found more<br>brilliant I used more for my PhD and he<br>visited us he was brilliant we hired him<br>we will see if as opposed to for three<br>or four years unfortunately we then went<br>out of money and he moved in the<br>industry for a few years but not as a<br>professor in paris so he's doing very<br>well the other people here<br>just again the advantages of open source<br>these r e guys are from Germany they in<br>a similar way discovered more started<br>contributing the love interesting work<br>on clustering so he's now professor in<br>Munich at the LM university there this<br>is one of the top ranked universities in<br>Germany and also with like 70 or 80 in<br>the world so it's really cool to have<br>him there I'm going to skip this because<br>in the interest of time I'm just going<br>to show you with those tools what can we<br>actually do I've just selected a few<br>applications that have been involved in<br>over the number of years to give you an<br>idea of the bread because basically<br>whenever you have data you can apply our<br>tools it may not find something<br>something interesting but at least you<br>can try the first thing is rain radar<br>images med service has this web page<br>where you get rain radar so again<br>there's the digitalization of everything<br>ten years ago they might affect the rain<br>radar but they will have the pictures no<br>one else had them now they put them on a<br>webpage you can go there you can look at<br>it but you can scrape it now this is a<br>picture of Eros and a half minutes you<br>want to know second rain or not after<br>this talk in last time also well looks<br>working on that and currently is getting<br>really good results so this looks almost<br>perfect it's a little bit cheating<br>because this is only for seven half<br>minutes it was interesting if you<br>predict an hour into the future it's not<br>as good but it's good enough and it<br>still works and sexually this is using<br>trees again so science you find<br>something different why cutler you have<br>to talk about cars no way around there<br>was already a few years ago probably<br>five I think when Adam did his master's<br>and looked at an interesting problem<br>that the LSE posed to him from data that<br>you collect during milking can you<br>predict whether the cows in heat or not<br>so it's time for artificial insemination<br>or not um well this is kind of shows you<br>how good the system isn't if it would be<br>perfect you would be up here there's a<br>lot of room for improvement here now<br>this is kind of the best he go so he got<br>some improvement but it wasn't perfect<br>he was using trees again in some<br>interesting ways it was a success<br>scientifically he published he<br>master's application was made was a bit<br>of a failure because it's not being used<br>in daily by LLC but because I'm<br>interested in their fire three or four<br>of our PhD credits now so maybe even<br>from occasion point of view it was an<br>indirect success I can totally different<br>electricity is all being digitized your<br>smart meters at home we know everything<br>about your electricity consumption this<br>was a pilot again three or four years<br>ago just a couple of like five thousand<br>households in some suburb in some large<br>city in New Zealand with some company I<br>can't name be to write them on the<br>research program i was having involved<br>with that this is the profile you would<br>expect high peak in the morning not a<br>big but why the pic and evening and this<br>actually do for a number of those five<br>thousand like a few hundreds but not for<br>all of them now it's a different one it<br>can't look similar in shape but has<br>different properties like there's always<br>a lot of electricity being consumed all<br>the time and a lot more at night so read<br>it's winter and people are heating a lot<br>that's a fair assumption if you get the<br>picture in summer something's wrong<br>maybe your hot water cylinders broken<br>and just burn through electricity and<br>you get this any guess what that could<br>be it's pretty flat but it's not zero<br>and the scale is actually different this<br>even the larger screen size only like<br>point2 and 24 this is the average on<br>Waitangi day people don't consume much<br>electricity and also they have no peaks<br>they get up early some of us and<br>somewhat get up late and use more<br>electricity during the day but it's very<br>different now this very interesting in<br>terms of average of consumption so for<br>supply side management networks bro so<br>personally if you can compare your<br>household do the average household in<br>your neighborhood you know how you're<br>doing comparison and maybe you're doing<br>really well or maybe it is something<br>that you might want to look into yet<br>another application again totally<br>different but again internet tweets<br>digital data<br>if Twitter really useful because you can<br>interpret them and they can try to find<br>interesting things like some of them<br>smileys and so what we try here is from<br>the smileys and from a small lexicon<br>where we know that help is a positive<br>word inside is negative and so on we try<br>to kind of learn for new words to<br>predict something like you find out with<br>the LOL it's probably positive someone<br>says it's a really word anyway it's<br>strong indication of some negative<br>feelings vector is neutral and this is<br>the company maybe but then it will<br>probably be capitalized and even if not<br>then here we would have some information<br>that this was actually name of the<br>company so you can do all these<br>different things without tools it's<br>really up to you to kind of come up with<br>what you want to analyze and how you<br>want to do it okay um just new password<br>if heard about Big Data not in next<br>thing is little big data it's your<br>personal data because if you think about<br>it with all the stuff being digital you<br>generate a lot of digital information<br>every day if you had a way of putting it<br>all together and analyzing that for<br>yourself I have someone analyze it for<br>you could give you very interesting<br>insights about your behavior maybe if<br>you have like health articles or help<br>there there's a lot of potential there I<br>think but this one for the future and<br>then kind of close to wrapping up here<br>that's good so I make a few suggesting<br>what I think you should ask companies<br>for and what you should ask you a member<br>of parliament for the government you<br>want pedo technology our internet is<br>still too slow in too expensive fiber is<br>okay is getting there but especially<br>mobile is not competitive international<br>terms I was likely to spend three weeks<br>in Austria last year I can get unlimited<br>mobile internet for thirty dollars a<br>month i was using 30 gigs in three weeks<br>because once you have it use it for<br>everything i was actually a bit of an<br>experiment wasn't using my mobile phone<br>was using an ipad so they can't make<br>phone calls and the skype was something<br>like that works perfectly fine and<br>specially it's brilliant because there's<br>no roaming if I skype someone in New<br>Zealand or someone in Germany or some in<br>it's a kind of legal point of view I<br>think what we actually want this we want<br>to be the owners of around data right<br>now you will school you will facebook<br>whatever you click terms of conditions<br>accepted without reading because<br>everyone does that they own your data I<br>think what should have mrs. actually be<br>on the data and beyond the grant them a<br>license to use our data and then you<br>could have something like an official<br>information sect not just for government<br>but for companies so that you have the<br>right to ask the company what data do<br>you store about me because it could be<br>useful like they may have things gotten<br>completely wrong and you might want to<br>be able to correct that all you might<br>want to do you own or less is a few on<br>data and we won I have free access to<br>public elected data which section New<br>Zealand really brilliant already a lot<br>of stuff that statistic New Zealand and<br>various government departments as you<br>can just download a file with 500,000<br>records of road accidents from the last<br>15 years analyze that you find the<br>number one reason for accidents it's not<br>speeding it's not being intoxicated it's<br>tailgating so don't tailgate and the<br>excellent weight will come down by at<br>least twenty five percent anyone I have<br>decision-making based on data on<br>information what would need what do we<br>need to do we I mean computer science<br>and especially data scientists and<br>specifically need to get better at<br>educating people about probabilities and<br>what they mean and there which is<br>meetings and stuff are totally to<br>improve they need to be able to deal<br>with larger data in faster ways they<br>need to become simpler more<br>user-friendly kindly what we build this<br>for experts but you would wonder<br>something like Excel that everyone can<br>use them unless their own data when I<br>also take my advantage of what's being<br>produced digitally right now it's really<br>mainly for advertising if you look at<br>Google Facebook whatever and also<br>surveillance of course but I think<br>there's a lot more poachers like in<br>health or with transportation so for<br>instance with your GPS and with your<br>mobile phones if you think about like<br>Hamels not bad but Auckland southern<br>motorway you're on the southern motorway<br>Monday morning you want to go to the CBD<br>the more wasteful even without accidents<br>the mobile phone providers know about<br>that because you know all the phones are<br>there<br>and so you could be smart and rerouting<br>people like if I actually don't want to<br>go to CBD but I want to go to airport<br>and there's some blockage between the<br>convenient Monica I could be routed off<br>the motorway already in takanini so<br>probably much better in votes morning<br>Russia if you route everyone off the<br>motorway then you just moved the problem<br>to Great South Road so what you want is<br>kind of a system that has an overview<br>and partially rewrites some users so<br>that kind of a load balancing going on<br>so let you make best use of all the<br>channels that you have that people<br>working on apps for that so it's not<br>just an idea Petr x.x can be anything<br>like education you're helping struggling<br>students picking up that this dragon for<br>removal stuff like that it's being<br>looked at okay Sam finish so this is a<br>list of all my courses over the years I<br>hope I haven't forgotten anyone some of<br>you are here it's about 70 and I'm<br>adding new ones as we speak and I'll<br>maybe before i go to exit just mentioned<br>that if you located the names i can<br>guess some of those so the Caliph quite<br>numb of different places of course<br>there's still strong focus on Europe's<br>or cross from portugal and spain and<br>france and italy and germany and austria<br>Slovenia and Belgium Netherlands and<br>Luther mania for places of the New<br>Zealand of course and China and India<br>and South America Chile Brazil it's<br>getting there we really international I<br>wanted a big thank you they run in the<br>group this is more or less a complete<br>list of the current members the solar<br>space for new ones as you can see you<br>picture could be here I have to say a<br>big thank you to especially Ian because<br>he's the reason I'm here he convinced me<br>twice to come here first for my postdoc<br>and then later for permanent position I<br>think it was a good decision both from<br>my career but also for my family so I'm<br>really happy thank you in I was a Jeff<br>and doing an amazing job over the years<br>and everyone else and this brings me to<br>my last slide in one prediction and I<br>should have made that a capital F I<br>think in hindsight so you'll remember<br>this right<br>it was four years ago it was really<br>close with a nail-biting final so my<br>very unscientific prediction is this we<br>can have a repeat it's going to be<br>equally bad but the 51 percentage that<br>is a very positive when it's very close<br>and I'm hopeful that on Sunday we can<br>increase that number at lunch time thank<br>you<br>okay it's my job just to finalize<br>proceedings now so this concludes the<br>formal part of the evening I don't know<br>how form all that was but it was fairly<br>formal i think i'd like to acknowledge<br>professor Farina for his his his talk<br>which covered a great history really of<br>the modern times and the kind of<br>problems that the field machine learning<br>is dealing with on a daily basis and<br>hopefully we the field that helps<br>improve our lives in the future that's<br>one of the big hopes anyway for the<br>field and it should be mentioned that<br>Professor firing ham was actually<br>recruited from a jazz club in bari by<br>Professor Witten in 1996 I know this<br>because they didn't invite me probably<br>probably quite wisely really so I<br>believe that was the origin of why he<br>came here probably after a few Stynes<br>but anyway at least he came back again<br>because he's made an amazing<br>contribution to the department and the<br>field of machine learning one of the<br>things that's not well known is that at<br>some point in history in the last 20<br>years where machine learning has become<br>an extremely big field Waikato had more<br>people on the Editorial Board of the<br>machine learning journal than any other<br>university in the world so that shows<br>you the sort of impact that the group's<br>had in the field and professor firing I<br>was certainly one of those people that<br>was on the on the on the list so I'd<br>like to know actually how many articles<br>bernard has refereed perhaps you could<br>estimate that sometime but it's an<br>amazing thing that he's done for the<br>field not just his own work but the<br>amount of refereeing he does and the<br>contributions he makes<br>not just for the journal for all the<br>conferences that is on the program<br>committee for so I don't think I'm going<br>to summarize the talk too much I think<br>it's an ongoing thing revolutions are<br>always talked about in terms of history<br>looking back and I'm saw that will<br>happen as bernad said in 50 years time<br>they look back and and declare the 21st<br>century as the age of digitization and<br>machine learning of course so I'd like<br>to thank you for attending the talk it's<br>so it's wonderful for me to see so many<br>people here if that's that's marvelous<br>and thank you for sporting both Bernard<br>the faculty and the University and at<br>the bar will be open once you leave the<br>auditorium where you can purchase your<br>own drinks so that's very generous offer<br>her<br>and of course if during this<br>presentation you've come up with a few<br>ideas of your own and you want to<br>discuss them further with Bernard I'm<br>sure he'll be happy to talk to you about</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
