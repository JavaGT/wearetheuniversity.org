tiene una hora tengo aqui te mana o<br>tiene fin OoT da da como yo nrt why did<br>we know Waikato family hypocrite on Eva<br>hypocrite on Eva acuerdate a cure<br>everybody it's a good to see you're here<br>I I was just saying that for those of us<br>that had a lunch Julia hosted by the VC<br>we were well looked after should have<br>stopped at the mains and lift the<br>disease but couldn't couldn't resist<br>sign in boy and of course we had the<br>opportunity to listen to why older so it<br>was really nice to a year so it's good<br>to be here again I come here every week<br>every year to clean eating a day to talk<br>about our scholarships and it's been<br>interesting for me as a lamb nigh of<br>this university to watch the large<br>number of waikato students being<br>successful in our scholarship program<br>and so I'm going to talk a little bit<br>about the scholarships but before that<br>i'm actually going to do a bit of a<br>presentation i did in our annual<br>conference couple weeks ago so apologies<br>to those of you that were there two<br>weeks exhaust two weeks ago ed<br>children's you will have heard some of<br>this a few<br>here at that at the time that I<br>presented this and the reason I'm<br>starting here is that this presentation<br>really gives a bit of a context for the<br>scholarships it started out as an idea<br>around Marty capability building to<br>pre-clear foot to be trust is an<br>offshoot of the monty fisheries<br>settlement but our focus is education<br>and training and we've developed a focus<br>around building multi capability into<br>the mighty economy or into Maudie<br>business really and that was the reason<br>why we have set up these scholarships<br>for which students from the university<br>of waikato have been very successful I<br>believe but I think what does emerged<br>over the last few years as an<br>understanding of the context really of<br>what we're trying to achieve so it's not<br>just about scholarships our trust uses<br>the iconography of Navi to fi charting a<br>pathway utilizing the stars and so what<br>we are likening to where we are at is<br>the bold decision planning and strategy<br>that our two pinar used to come here<br>from a Waikiki they had wayfinders to<br>find their way they had stars that they<br>followed they had multi-donor we've been<br>here a lot about here today and they<br>knew what they were doing and so they<br>set a pathway for themselves into the<br>Pacific to the south and they had a<br>really strong sense of what they were<br>going to achieve a lot of us have been<br>working in and talking about the post<br>treaty settlement era so Marty finally<br>you're in a position that seems where we<br>re engaging in this country's economy we<br>are starting to take more responsibility<br>for decisions about own resources and<br>working in some of the key industries<br>for which this country is well known for<br>so the iconography for us is important<br>what we're trying to do is actually<br>actually and try and understand or<br>articulate or develop some shared<br>visions about what the future is going<br>to look like and so fundamentally we say<br>our trust is about the future we try and<br>understand what will the mighty economy<br>look like in 30 years time what from<br>what we know now can we say about Marty<br>and forestry mining<br>Marty in the environment and another 20<br>or 30 years because it's really<br>important for us as a trust because<br>we're trying to build capability for<br>that future what is clear is that the<br>way in which industry happens today is<br>not the way in which it's going to<br>happen tomorrow and certainly not in the<br>future so we need to be anticipating<br>better wear it as we want to go to and<br>how we're going to get there so we see<br>ourselves as as as people who are trying<br>to encourage and share thinking about<br>the future so this provides some of the<br>context for the scholarships so this<br>year at the conference I spoke this was<br>the title of my cordial I'm going to<br>just shut that up a bit because I don't<br>have as much time here as I did on the<br>day and in what this was about was<br>actually bringing together the themes of<br>the conference and what I saw in terms<br>of the three main areas that we covered<br>in the conference the first area was<br>looking at Marty in international trade<br>Marty working with other indigenous<br>peoples an international trade and we<br>had some speakers from Canada First<br>Nations come down we all say it's um you<br>speak from Iceland now this the second<br>theme of the conference is about coke<br>bottle Marty in modern management<br>decisions and so Tamar portico from time<br>of group holdings limited presented on<br>the back of his article that was in the<br>New Zealand here what a few months ago<br>about how we acknowledge kpop Ahmadi in<br>the main which we think when we're<br>making corporate decisions on behalf of<br>our people and the third theme was about<br>where we're trying to go to the future<br>of Monica fisheries industry as always<br>thinking about these things I came up<br>with this presentation theatre North<br>America Thor not equal tawheed tongue<br>located only Haryana not the quartet in<br>a corridor within a all hearty kid named<br>Arthur kitty so what I want to say first<br>is that from what i know and i'm still<br>learning we are at the end of the day<br>our spiritual people and if we're going<br>to make effective decisions in the mahdi<br>economy going forward we have to<br>understand<br>and what is it about a spiritual expert<br>reality that undermines the way in which<br>we make those decisions in the way which<br>should behave and eat and what I put to<br>the conference a couple of weeks ago was<br>that was the challenge I suppose about<br>the extent to which we particularly<br>those of us working in business Marty<br>business in particular mari own business<br>multi businesses that are there for our<br>people do we still believe and now the<br>things that we say about our spiritual<br>side do we still follow through and I<br>was still mindful of the fact that we<br>are spiritual people that people like<br>the korte and others have actually<br>clarified for us from the past going<br>into the future their expectations of us<br>as a people and now put this one in<br>particular because it struck me as<br>something that highlights i suppose what<br>we trying to achieve with the alumni<br>that are coming through our scholarship<br>program and that is to quality and<br>others knew that there was going to come<br>a time and it'd be a new generation of<br>young people who would come through and<br>through collaboration and unity they<br>would actually lead us across the sky<br>into a new feature that's the way i'm<br>interpreting what the courtiers here<br>here and i suppose that's what we're if<br>you like putting on or expecting of the<br>young people that are coming through our<br>scholarship program because at the end<br>of the day you are the privileged few<br>still unfortunately amongst the other<br>people who are coming through with the<br>kinds of degrees we need and we need you<br>to lead in drag others into the fray so<br>never forget who you are spiritually<br>manatsu machinima<br>and I continue to I was just havin a<br>chat about the environment continue to<br>try and remember that at all the<br>corridor all of our motto dagner me says<br>to us that manaphy Noah is critical to<br>who in what we are and we had sooo Mason<br>Durie at the conference and one of the<br>things he pointed out right up front one<br>of the things he noted was that it's<br>very hard to be talking to Finn or if<br>you don't own anything over and the<br>reality has been that over the last 20<br>years in particular the proportion of<br>land per capita owned by marty is<br>decreasing and one of my hobby horses<br>because I work past lovers 15 years as a<br>consultant with Monty lean blocks and<br>corporations is that from my money we<br>one of our key strategies doesn't matter<br>with us tiny group holdings or your<br>local interest we need to be acquiring<br>more leaned and personally what does my<br>pistol view you know China is an issue<br>for us because unlike other other people<br>who purchase farms in this country I<br>expect that they will be holding on to<br>that land for another thousand years so<br>I mean there's nothing needs to the<br>Chinese they want to feed their people<br>and that's great but for me it's about<br>us are also understanding that we need<br>to be thinking hard about manner FINRA<br>and affected the fennel will still be an<br>important component to our money overall<br>the other part of this of course is that<br>our fina is proper to a look and that<br>second challenge I put to the audience<br>the other day was to remind us<br>particularly those in decision-making<br>positions ask them do you see this when<br>you look at our finna do you see in your<br>mind's eye popper to Anika when you're<br>making those decisions about land use<br>options are you thinking about manaphy<br>no because from for me in terms of our<br> a Papa coronary it's your neck up<br>opportunity to adorn a camel toe heel<br>toe cut or do we still believe and<br>follow their thinking when we make your<br>so this man Athena whoa I read pretty<br>widely and I don't know many of you have<br>read he cut Tolly or seen him on youtube<br>he is a spiritualist spiritualist really<br>he's actually someone who probably like<br>to call T like about Donna like Jesus<br>and others has been a student of the<br>essence of what it is to be on this<br>planet actually in cell-free talking<br>about Manhattan otha so the things i<br>know about mahna mahna mahna phenomena<br>Tonetta is that we are all here for<br>particular purpose insignia ticker and<br>our you know a Papa and our motto<br>Ragnar reminds us of that you just gotta<br>keep holding on to that and again what<br>is going to be your contribution knowing<br>that how important you are to yourself<br>to your far note to your hapu to your<br>ear en to this country in the world and<br>it was interesting we have done instead<br>cirali from the states is italian here<br>talking about what he has seen a short<br>time here was his first visit to New<br>Zealand sorry second about how he sees<br>that indigenous people like Marty<br>actually have such a huge contribution<br>to the whole world and from a context of<br>entrepreneurship and economic<br>development services of you so a mano<br>tanha thur and finally for me in someone<br>sent me an email the other day who would<br>be in at the conference and I'd never<br>thought about this way but they he sent<br>me this long email he really enjoyed the<br>conference and then he head at the<br>bottom up in capital letters manatsu<br>class manaphy noah plus monaten gotta<br>equals mana motuhake and sever the full<br>pathog oh I must use that I must use<br>that next time I'll present this but<br>what in terms of mana motuhake again I<br>was recently came across this I'm saying<br>from Sierra Leone another still probably<br>the most foremost Marty politician will<br>be the scene and hit what he was saying<br>that I have never been subservient to a<br>prime minister and he worked with<br>several to a bishop in a week with<br>several and<br>in essence he was saying i am first and<br>foremost nightspore oh so my challenge<br>to all of us and to you students coming<br>through as who will you be first and<br>foremost who will you be first and<br>foremost will you exercise monitor man<br>offender manito lata and therefore i<br>believe mine and what's your hockey in<br>the way in which you think about the<br>work ahead of you ahead of us so that a<br>nun nutshell was it was a quite a bit<br>longer on the day so you probably<br>thankful you don't have to sit through<br>the longer version but there's a<br>nutshell was what I presented just two<br>weeks ago here at the problems so we<br>have not fit to fi the conference which<br>we run every year but it actually will<br>set up just to support our scholarship<br>program and these are there 45<br>recipients for 2015 this year we were<br>lucky enough to have 35 tyrita<br>scholarship recipients for Marty<br>completing a business degree 5 Lorna<br>scholarship recipients for those<br>completing our fisheries and fishery<br>science degree in far me and these all<br>names off hit two obviously for<br>scholarships associated with agriscience<br>and agribusiness and corner comedy Keith<br>or weenie you might think and so we were<br>lucky enough to have some really<br>fantastic speakers present at the<br>conference and it's always happening for<br>for me to be at the conference because<br>it gives us a lot of confidence about<br>where we going to as a people in the<br>mighty economy so one of the things I<br>was going to do is just jump across to<br>our website I know some of you is a few<br>of you here already have received the<br>scholarship but I'm going to just jump<br>to the website one because it's<br>brand-new we just and it up it looks<br>really nice but two for those of you did<br>maybe I thinking about applying next<br>year can know where to go so there you<br>go so that's that's our homepage and as<br>you can see our boy line is trading<br>pathways for Marty education and futures<br>and very simple of course there's a bit<br>about the trust and if you're interested<br>in any of the documents that we've<br>developed it's quite a bit here this is<br>a bit our purpose but in publications if<br>unit in fisheries in some of the work<br>that we've been doing there they are all<br>downloadable off the website people it's<br>not much not very nice to look at but is<br>it just for us T I should acknowledge<br>then my fellow directors and look you're<br>going engaged on Tammy hidden valley<br>white city and I'm lucky enough to be<br>cheer on the trust but two important<br>bits one is the scholarships and if you<br>go into here you'll get information<br>about the about the various scholarships<br>so that the round for the she obviously<br>is just closed and the scholarships will<br>open again in January the scholarship<br>far as to a worth of about ten thousand<br>dollars it's eligible to those who are<br>in the final year of the degree and you<br>have to attend the comfort of the<br>conference Snuffy to how far as part of<br>the scholarship yes so it's really it's<br>just Rick white numbers I think it's<br>been fantastic here to see why cut will<br>do so well every year and this is our 60<br>of scholarships Waikato University has<br>constituted about fifty percent of all<br>of our scholarship recipients which is<br>amazing one I think because because<br>there are a lot of Mahdi healed i think<br>the number is actually bigger and some<br>of the other business schools around the<br>place but also i'd like to acknowledge<br>the work that they're pulling it put a<br>gray does here in terms of supporting<br>you guys to actually get the<br>scholarships filled out it's a bit of a<br>rigmarole I know filling out our<br>application forms because the one of the<br>key things about our scholarship and<br>this goes back to the context what I was<br>to embed before is the keys the key<br>criteria for us here our first a<br>commitment to your father to your eye<br>and to your e we this number one for us<br>number two is your commitment to 30 mari<br>means that is<br>of a marker for number one and the third<br>one which is unusual for these kinds of<br>scholarships is your max so we're<br>looking for their complete Marty doing a<br>business degree or a science degree who<br>is both really capable and doing well in<br>their program but also has a commitment<br>to the people and it's those the kind of<br>leaders that we're looking for so as a<br>result of this weave we start in 2011<br>with alumni and just so we can see the<br>photos of some of these people here in<br>the in the crowd this is the easier<br>scholarship recipients for this year and<br>if you want to have a closer look so<br>here we have another call Phi sorry hun<br>oh so you can see what what you're doing<br>and people are really interested in this<br>because now we have a lot of tribal<br>leader show up now hit people like like<br>Missy takano and Shay Wolfson there and<br>and it's always interesting to hear them<br>say well I didn't know you know making<br>the connection with some day some of<br>these young people coming through so you<br>if you want to see all the different<br>months from this year you all here and<br>again about a full half from the<br>University of way capital and similarly<br>you can have a look you know they knew<br>your boob site and importantly we've got<br>previous years as well and so you can<br>see all the ones that have come through<br>over the years so the second part about<br>this is that one of the key things we're<br>trying to do through the scholarship<br>program is to privilege our young people<br>when i was here i started here in 1979<br>we were talked about some of the stuff<br>we used to get up to back in the day but<br>and good to see the Kabaka doing some of<br>those old standards like here I got my<br>and and indeed way that we used to do as<br>a boy but a lot has changed since that<br>time and I started here in Sydney 19 of<br>us and rolled in a batch of management<br>studies any two of us finished myself<br>and Steve Rudy so they weren't many of<br>us coming out with business degrees in<br>those days so to see these kind of<br>numbers now tar widows in particular as<br>a very competitive<br>scholarship we're up to about 100 now<br>applicants each year and the key number<br>for us is 30 a year we try to do 30 at<br>least but we did 35 this year which is<br>great so if you had a chance and<br>certainly in terms of applying you just<br>go to the website and it's all there and<br>if you want to contact people and you<br>can talk to Carlene who does all our<br>so it's the keyway as i said we hear<br>from some fantastic speakers come to our<br>conference and the shearer you were<br>really lucky to get any snow cirali if<br>you have a mind to he's done Ted books<br>so if you want to go on the internet his<br>talk has had 2.4 million hits he's an<br>experienced entrepreneur ship and he's<br>got a program that he runs all over the<br>world and he's been responsible for<br>60,000 business startups in indigenous<br>and remote communities all over the<br>world all the continents basically and<br>he was certainly an inspiration to us<br>and what the trust is planned to do is<br>bring him back next year we're going to<br>start developing more Marty mentals<br>under his program who can then within<br>the communities to support Marty<br>entrepreneurship so some of you might<br>want to get involved with it we also had<br>two young fine young First Nations guys<br>from Canada come down young leaders<br>working in the consultancy spaces<br>working with the tribes and bands over<br>there and they also I felt were really<br>inspirational for us and seeing that our<br>brothers and sisters over and candidate<br>and places like that in a similar space<br>and it was great having them here we<br>have some fantastic speakers come to our<br>conference I made a point at the<br>conference this year that that we don't<br>advertise the conference really and it's<br>just about us as body sitting in the<br>room and trying to think about what<br>we're going to do for the future that's<br>the key part for it so some you know<br>fantastic array of the speakers this<br>year you should know something like Tom<br>apotheker and Missy and Shey and he was<br>like Tony to kingi and Tina Wolfson and<br>Grammy rip so we have a fantastic lineup<br>some of those<br>squished and of course we had the<br>minister there at the dinner and he's<br>been a fantastic support and will be<br>more of a support going forward as I<br>said we had sooo Mason Durie there as<br>always just some insightful and such a<br>clear think about the future and he's<br>given us some really good ideas about<br>where we can go with the kind of shared<br>and collaborative visioning that we're<br>doing within the trust and so they are<br>just a bunch of scholarship recipients<br>our hopes and aspirations are that they<br>are leaders for tomorrow you might not<br>think it looking at the photo but for<br>their to the expectation just quickly I<br>just want to acknowledge all co-sponsors<br>and it's great having University of<br>working on board this year they loudest<br>working with theme and has to do a few<br>more scholarships ASB this year we<br>secured three lots of internships so the<br>Scott the students had first dibs on<br>applying for I think it's four or five<br>ASP internships so we just negotiated<br>those for this year so those of you that<br>being have applied good luck because I<br>think it's a great opportunity Treasury<br>also provided some internships for us<br>this year and we expect some of our<br>scholarship recipients to be successful<br>there and also via discussions there<br>with KPMG massif who speak in the other<br>room today has been do a lot of work and<br>we hope to have those internships the<br>ear up soon so gain opportunities for<br>scholarship recipients to go straight<br>into a place with his work I've been<br>talking to a bunch of other companies<br>around as well places like the Superfund<br>and indeed trading enterprise and we<br>expected more internships available for<br>our students next year but to<br>acknowledge not quite up a Mario<br>altidore we can closely with the body<br>accountants group as well and just<br>trying to make opportunities for people<br>to your place their jobs Marty education<br>trust someone mentioned before about<br>picking the people that receive<br>scholarships we don't do it the trust<br>does it for<br>I was a lot to acknowledge them because<br>they're doing it for us for nothing<br>actually said 130 hundred and forty<br>scholarship applications we received<br>this year we didn't even get to see them<br>which was really good they read them all<br>and in that and we give them some<br>criteria and they ranked everybody and<br>we got a list so they send us a list of<br>this year 45 names and media screen yep<br>and it's so they're doing a fantastic<br>job for us so you cannot also go to<br>their website if you want to get the<br>application forms and they can also help<br>you with an application so can we pin<br>theater thank you for coming in down<br>please share this website address with<br>anyone you know during the degree or<br>degrees here in the management study<br>school also and the sciences areas those<br>doing agricultural and Fisheries type<br>degrees and also any fun I members you<br>know at other universities why could I<br>was doing really well but we're trying<br>to get us to lift their game I can sail<br>it was really disappointed at Oakland<br>University only had one scholarship<br>recipient us year at a 45 which was kind<br>of crazy because you probably have more<br>Marty students than anyone in the<br>country but it was good there was four<br>star theor this year from oakland<br>university so they're going to try and<br>pull themselves together and actually<br>try and compete with white Catawba<br>better we want more money to come<br>through with these degrees because we<br>need them in the companies like I work<br>in like here we investor Cummings like<br>Tony group holdings even your trusts and<br>corporations that you associated with<br>they will need you to come through with<br>the skills that you will have both in PR<br>mari manatsu mondo findra monitor gotta<br>mana motuhake and all this other stuff<br>that you lean here the university of<br>waikato in your accounting classes and<br>your marketing classes and your IT<br>classes and all that stuff so can opt la<br>tenebra channeling pathways for more<br>he's going to come back so I'm just<br>looking at it as scholarships as we know<br>as students is really important to the<br>student life and we've got the statistic<br>get them through the Tyrannosaurus<br>Richard as the chairman Orbis that has<br>paid out more than 700,000 to management<br>students from work at all so what we're<br>going to do is going to invite three of<br>the students who are current recipients<br>for 2015 22 sell the program to us let<br>us know where you are from why you<br>applied in some things about the<br>scholarship that you thought were really<br>important and was set up with Zachary hi<br>to me I mean you would do Abigail and<br>leave the animal so what's going on<br>volumes in free casting and I'm really<br>proud to have been a recipient of the<br>I would a scholarship this year all from<br>blacks in University and mostly probably<br>seen here around and yeah it was just a<br>huge keep missing almost any huge<br>privilege to be able to give the<br>scholarship I found the conference I<br>wasn't actually sure what to expect with<br>the conference but I found it to be<br>awesome you know the last few days<br>they're affected I'm kind of sharing<br>things we do I thought you know is it<br>was a business conference you know with<br>business leaders speaking most of us for<br>business students and throw the<br>conference I've ever heard in my talk<br>about making money and was all about<br>making a difference and they've really<br>inspired me and you know that's what's<br>remain with me know who speakers at arms<br>Richard put up there on the slides are<br>me each and every one her different<br>perspective then you know I was there<br>taking notes in the book of the writer<br>than I've reviewed those notes because<br>you know I hope to be able to apply some<br>of things that they'd look into my<br>career on for and I think was a message<br>i need to hear especially like with a<br>scholarships given to us in our final<br>year I'm actually it's something that we<br>need to know about going into the world<br>such as about what we're learning in<br>event management school at least be<br>tempted by the things that experience<br>here to taught us also in a practical<br>level I'm $10,000 10,000 those as colors<br>a huge hug the for me especially in<br>my wife and welcomes out our first child<br>and so on the second lobsters off there<br>but in a you know an intangible ooh I<br>guess you know a starship there's ten<br>thousand dollars no that's huge and<br>First Union I think it's given me a lot<br>of belief myself because I me realize<br>education can you glue and that's what<br>it means to some of the people are gone<br>for us and so you know it's a med tell<br>me hugely and I think the benefits will<br>just keep flight and so those things you<br>know thinking about it for next year and<br>I'm applied both of you know people who<br>you know are in position you may be able<br>to apply seen that the makers it's um<br>it's huge and yeah just one skin like<br>the fake Richard and yeah thank you so<br>firstly I applied I think we can all<br>agree team we are both going into and<br>that's one of you is no mean for it<br>would help me with my five year so you<br>would help me give a receipt it's my big<br>old sort of overseas keep some<br>experience<br>but also a lot of people said it was a<br>great opportunity and it wasn't until I<br>got to the conference and I didn't<br>realize it so I think I walked away with<br>50 new facebook friends and the clothing<br>including Andrelton luton account<br>because the new Venetian there but for<br>me I will do thinking I were to occur<br>via management and fortunately I got to<br>meet Holly Everett who organizes the<br>conference and she has your own<br>adventure company so I was really cool<br>to have your personal contact or later<br>here and say worship center that's<br>really awesome yeah that was just very<br>inspiring to see so many so many worthy<br>is so many different industries as I<br>like it was suddenly for everyone I mean<br>was 45 passes but it was like fisheries<br>new ones and they might I see if it was<br>I wanna feel anata ni Madonna Rihanna<br>nahi a hue naona and Makka pakka Pocari<br>cat serenity rocky tonight oh really<br>hiya hottie a popo a nike t minus t0<br>keno

time I hope it<br>so our superior this year and it was my<br>privilege I they want to buy oh well the<br>reason why I applied for the scholarship<br>was because the whole lot of girlfriends<br>gonna last year checks from the compound<br>um yes I knew that that was made us yes<br>I gotta be as soon as I am opened and I<br>was very grateful to receive the<br>scholarship in know my name told me that<br>we picked us but I plate and you know<br>they say that you should surround people<br>are surrounded staff with people who are<br>on the same machinery I'm going to this<br>conference and meeting the other<br>recipients is exactly that and they say<br>that when will your biggest takeaways<br>would be the networks that you make with<br>all the industry leaders the one of my<br>biggest takeaways was not the food<br>because if you looked at the photo of a<br>seductive yeah but that was the<br>relationships be made with people from<br>other universities and cheering<br>experiences and talking about you know<br>what goes on me is the same as for<br>infants here and talking about our<br>dreams as well videos probably my<br>biggest tank wedding I think yeah<br>mixture apply I mean you have nothing to<br>lose a little bit no time that you put<br>into it but yeah that's right the<br>American Indians so I'd like to employ<br>well one of the inaugural reception<br>she's a Teddy nevah kina and she doesn't<br>Tina kolkata kolkata meet the lovely be<br>happy kolkata mohammed a martini oh how<br>cool waikato me not really to even come<br>at Amarna me naughty he needed a<br>biscotti karate po po unity Moroi costly<br>nawrocki know who I don't know I am a<br>little nervous so you just need to deal<br>with me I studied here I believe between<br>2008 to 2012 it was five years of my<br>life spit got taken away from me towards<br>my degrees and i graduated with a<br>Bachelor management studies first class<br>economics in a bachelor of sciences and<br>biological science I walked away were<br>for whole heap of knowledge and I<br>employed today it's my couple finally I<br>went for my ely as a policy analyst and<br>I help them to meet the resettlement so<br>I was one of the inaugural scholarship<br>recipients and 2011 ah just like kidding<br>me I heard it was Kinkaid and I stopped<br>sleep I mean I wanted to get because as<br>a student of it was my fourth year I was<br>poor I had no life and I just was like<br>10k would do a whole lot for me and so I<br>applied for it and I was grateful to be<br>a recipient of that scholarship and the<br>first thing I thought was cool I can<br>survive for the next year two years and<br>there was a lot of money i can put it to<br>good use i could it wasn't so much pull<br>it towards my student loan or was to say<br>i could go out tonight with my friends<br>because i can do i can eat I can say<br>yeah I can come to a movie because I've<br>got team dollars now it was late level<br>of survival and I thought yay um it was<br>it was more of a relief for me and then<br>the second part of thought to myself and<br>when I wrote down what<br>scholarship would do for me and what I<br>could do to UM to live the dream of what<br>the scholarship was for I remember one<br>of the Toki was to be able to<br>walk in both wheels and it was tell<br>Parker girl moldy and I thought to<br>myself how can i do that i was on the<br>ice on quite luckily had but I heroes<br>from Waikato and I I thought to myself<br>how could I walk with Parker as well as<br>with Marley in the same incidence and go<br>into the conference not only was I able<br>to see how that happens at a corporate<br>level I was able to meet other<br>like-minded people like Karen who said<br>it Oh chica I like minded people like me<br>who thought how can we make this a<br>possibility and just being exposed to<br>all those businesses and industries you<br>know you'll be surprised about what's<br>happening you kind of just think<br>corporate means going to or for myself<br>corporate means just going to waste an<br>organization but when you get exposed to<br>those opportunities and so those<br>kirstens you can see how how much money<br>is going on out there so not only was<br>able to network like you said in that<br>space that I was also ever to network<br>with other recipients of the oval of the<br>award and to this day I cross paths<br>within so just like you said<br>surroundings up of like-minded people<br>there's there's the Copa that is the way<br>to go because you will cross paths of<br>dune begin I see people that I've met at<br>that conference in my everyday business<br>I'm sitting opposite at the table with<br>in bits how also that is to be here in<br>that space so just coming towards today<br>um suppose the scholarship was a huge<br>motivator for me I don't actually think<br>I would work for Wi-Fi thought but I do<br>and I'm proud of it but it was a big<br>motivator to know that everything that I<br>do with my degrees in my mahi is for my<br>people that's the that's one of the key<br>things that helped push me towards that<br>space so in my mind I work at a<br>strategic level I would crown that means<br>meetings with ministers as well as the<br>seas of ministries and I'm only a debt<br>level very rarely do i go to an<br>operational level for ministry on an<br>operational level it and work on white<br>castle I work with mom that I I help me<br>restore our and I help to ensure that<br>I'm realizing the needs of our people<br>and that they have a voice in and I'm<br>speaking for them so what I'm trying to<br>get it as just a scholarship was more<br>than just a 10k when I think about it it<br>was the opportunity to come to that<br>realization there everything I do it's<br>bigger than me which on cafe with Fitz I<br>like serving a greater purpose than just<br>saying I want to be financially<br>successful so if I could say anything<br>for the recipients the ethnic foods<br>yesterday day 10 k cowboy but these are<br>realize what you want to do make those<br>opportunities happen for you just know<br>that whatever your what even matter<br>you're gonna do in future know what<br>purpose it says for me mine was to serve<br>my people for you it may be something<br>else can't quite but just realize that<br>either there's a bigger world out there<br>in a few can tap into that right<br>profesor you can tap into that bigger<br>world there a big opportunities as well<br>so killer it's my little spiel with a<br>motivation for you till the speaker's 15<br>scholarships are really really important<br>for all students and I returned I was a<br>an executive assistant to a regional<br>commissioner and I thought this is not<br>me and I told my husband I wanted to go<br>back to school and we had a fight<br>because I had a good job I had good<br>money we just bought a big house to feed<br>a half for our children and I said I<br>wanted to go back to school and we<br>didn't talk for two weeks and then my<br>husband came and apologized he said I'm<br>sorry that you were to realize dreams<br>and I was standing in your way they gave<br>me three conditions he said I had to<br>stay the course a management degree is<br>for years and he said that I had to do<br>some post-grad work and then I had tea<br>and then x1 Wars is that I had to have<br>good max I he said to me why you're this<br>sweet out what did you do two degrees I<br>said obviously this so I did and one of<br>them was my management degree and yeah<br>and even though my husband was making<br>good money we were still poor it's hard<br>to say what you are you just making ends<br>meet so scholarships coming really<br>really handy and the table' the one came<br>up and you know I suppose the students<br>you pour over the criteria you pour over<br>the EC that you have to write you pour<br>over do I have these things that they<br>want to hear you pour over to our head<br>vision because there's lots of criteria<br>and and you think i do about many times<br>and i remember me Bizet coming to see me<br>we having this discussion about his<br>application what it bought and you know<br>because they are really quite strict<br>criteria and like you're saying it's<br>asking you to straight asking you to<br>think about being leaders and those<br>things are really really impor<br>at the end when the notifications came<br>out my sister got there per case my<br>sister had applied she got it my<br>daughter had applied she got it and<br>always go and I'd been get it I was<br>really upset I was really really upset<br>and then it came through by courier<br>because they had stopped my name wrong<br>so I was really happy after that most<br>people when I went to the conference<br>there were six sets of sisters they got<br>scholarships so it's 12 out of 30 we're<br>woman that's more than half the other<br>thing was really interesting is that<br>what kind of management school we had 18<br>of the scholarships young Oakland was<br>going on about unity the big management<br>school their innovative but my mum um<br>what do hokkien or wife at all and put<br>it has always been promotion and we're<br>really grateful because Richard is an<br>alum line of what a tool and use gain<br>these are things that can happen for<br>students I was grateful to be graded as<br>one of the young people for a day for a<br>corporate but it's shady I think about<br>scholarships scholarships validate me<br>staying at school scholars Charlotte<br>scholarships meanly some people my own<br>family my ear we acknowledged it with my<br>hard work that here is some benefits and<br>scholarships of course up I need to but<br>like tadinha seed is that if any out of<br>the trick you can put it on your CV you<br>can tell them how much it was you can<br>say that I'll go to conferences and you<br>mix them I i went to the last conference<br>i went with them for the tower whether i<br>saw some CEOs from medica they were<br>really cool you know need trying to be<br>Fonterra to be a little little man and a<br>big business but there it's you've<br>really quite successful and they went<br>already two degrees<br>by proceed now it still belongs to a new<br>way and yet the idea was this five<br>percent of two degrees is probably the<br>biggest telephone communications and New<br>Zealand honeybees there's some really<br>Kiva Marty people doing things that are<br>really innovative and it's not it's a<br>forum for us to share I saw some women<br>there are CEOs of their early Italian<br>muscles echo echo trolls open it was<br>really like you saying something here to<br>be exposed to those type of people that<br>just come from a little degree maybe a<br>little scholarship in tabloid has opened<br>up the doors to look at the stars and<br>that cool so scholarships are validation<br>their acknowledgement and definitely and<br>I like what Linda Smith sees means she<br>did her she does the Mahdi excellent<br>scholarships all like at all don't pay<br>off your student loan then go and buy a<br>book that's what student loan is for go<br>and feed your family don't buy something<br>like a hamburger or mcdonalds so that<br>your final was saying that we're with<br>you and then go buy your little drinks<br>nice pure pants so you're ready to go<br>from the next year and I think and I<br>think that and at my time that I were to<br>scholarship through it broken into three<br>parts your grades I had to keep going<br>working because my last payment is going<br>to be depended on my grade at the end of<br>the year I hate to attend a conference I<br>got put up in a four-star hotel with 30<br>other like-minded people and I got to be<br>with people that were thinking<br>somebody's thought they're always good<br>enough to get a scholarship and I'm<br>Marty so we need to see that with<br>everybody all our students that it's<br>really cool and I meet some really I met<br>Richard fan it was really cool because<br>we<br>we went to dinner in Rotorua and he was<br>officially got Verona he got the Roma<br>scholarship n yeah he's really cool you<br>know he's excited about going to clean<br>and all the things and opportunities<br>that are available for Marty students<br>through scholarships so um I think you<br>know when you put up their years they<br>put up like this I look better now but<br>without further ado everybody is that<br>will pass a little bit more time to<br>Richard we've got some time off or<br>procedures for them to come but this is<br>a wonderful opportunity to share with<br>everybody okay I think it's really cool<br>you are a recipient of cowardice<br>scholarships and you had been<br>immortalized on their webpage and when<br>somebody would cook at you and see where<br>they come from then probably you can<br>even filter to your tribe it's all the<br>different things so we thank you for the<br>wonderful scholarships and I wincing<br>bought me a hamburger and I went to top<br>my husband out for dinner and and we<br>spit bed ten thousand dollars of it<br>definitely wasn't on a book to go for<br>the next year and to feed my family<br>while we're there so in the future what<br>have I done I remember when they asked<br>to set the conference what do you want<br>to do when you grow up with your<br>scholarship I probably the one that's<br>raw that's frightening to me I wanted to<br>be a CEO and my thoughts haven't change<br>when I'm still trying to get there but<br>the one that probably sticks out for me<br>is my sister and CC that I want to open<br>up a university for Napoli and cc'd you<br>better put your training wheels on<br>sister because I'm going for it so we're<br>trying to kind of look at those certain<br>yeah those took the dreams so those are<br>things that scholarships can do they<br>open your eyes make you want to work a<br>bit harder you know you look at it's<br>terrible the way you Richard you go all<br>five hundred dollars not by seven<br>ten thousand a month that's how you do<br>it but it validates you you're capable<br>of doing those things so well invite<br>there's any other questions for the<br>scholarships or everybody will do our<br>timer and then will not invite um<br>Richard to close you've got a couple<br>more things so we'll about Abigail<br>it's already Oh Eddie go oh they even<br>Oh<br>I'll kill myself oh I'm just a couple of<br>things really 12 the to the ones you've<br>got up thank you and the big thing about<br>the scholarships follow-up is the alumni<br>and we try to keep you running front of<br>everybody else so you don't just keep<br>the network across your year but all<br>those parties that's why all those faces<br>are going to stay on the website the way<br>they are and part of that is about us<br>all helping each other you makes the<br>opportunities and so please keep in mind<br>the others that are following through<br>and nose and amongst your alumni because<br>they may be looking for the kind of<br>opportunity you see for them and we've<br>already seen opportunities that people<br>have opened up others keep in touch with<br>the trust because the trust also wants<br>to keep checking where you're going and<br>also will be making more opportunities<br>available to help you check through your<br>career and in the last thing order to<br>say is that in 2017 I'd like to see you<br>all at our conference 2017 is my last<br>year as a director on bootyful to be<br>trust and the conference that year the<br>focus is going to be on these young<br>people alumni bet you've been the key of<br>this key speakers for the conference so<br>what we want to hear is where the<br>scholarship recipients from past years<br>have gotten to and what they hear from<br>them about their careers how they're<br>tracking and how they're going to make a<br>contribution as we have today to our<br>people so country PT de hima
