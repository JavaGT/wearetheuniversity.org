session<br>today this afternoon decision is being<br>run by competing effectively of law we<br>acknowledge our Dean rumbles here and<br>it's also organized by the more<br>indigenous government center now Papa<br>for this mission we're looking at the<br>relationships of the Kingitanga and how<br>important those are and examining it in<br>the context of World War one<br>particularly this year New Zealand hell<br>we've been commemorating 100 years since<br>the failed Gallipoli campaign but the<br>involvement of Maori there non-maori and<br>health supposedly brought New Zealand<br>together as a nation<br>so some important part of our national<br>psyche national identity but what was<br>the kingi kind of doing it so that's the<br>coke pop what we're going to talk about<br>today we've got an exciting lineup of<br>experts while the experts in their own<br>right now we have this rowdy papa bring<br>what Jaime he's going to address us well<br>whatever they want to talk about but<br>something around the lines of like<br>little tiny world war one Kingitanga and<br>conscription with him after Rafi Tommy<br>Tommy Rose gonna speak to us and he's<br>going to present on a book recently<br>published at the money photo at World<br>War one<br>and then following motto Tommy we'll<br>have a presentation by Paul Meredith<br>money Patil and he's going to be talking<br>about the world war one monument 8 to<br>talk on the loo you know and the renewal<br>of that monument importance of it and<br>then finally we got a presentation by<br>Mike Ross<br>from Ngati Haua he's going to sort of<br>bring things up to date today and again<br>I talked about woke up to find new<br>governance and the for pub but they saw<br>power leaves they attempted also tying<br>in the relevance and the importance of<br>the Kingitanga and its relationships<br>today couple fine<br>so without further due pass the time<br>over to Bali but another thing whenever<br>administrative Mehta<br>I have a bell to add 15 minutes I'll<br>ring the bell to the reminder to start<br>bringing it to a close I can secure Hui<br>Hui Tata<br>Rob today to be here to chocolate he bit<br>the weight well not for little wrist<br>assured arms are quiet and bashful one<br>and so I'm the man of few words and I'll<br>leave all of that all of the elongated<br>are wonderful spills to my to my mates<br>over here how do we took me here to<br>Caputo tipo of the deepening School of<br>Law today to be here to chakra multi<br>rocket a to catwalk wahoo easy money but<br>the way to our corner the theme of my<br>Chi Papa today and I apologize that I<br>don't have a PowerPoint I came away from<br>my tangihanga earlier around today to<br>shoot back for the Kingitanga deck the<br>scene around my sort of spill to you<br>today is that what was the Kingitanga<br>doing throughout the world war one and<br>in particular what were the consequences<br>of the khan conscription or that<br>particular theme in law that was that<br>impacted on the Waikato and ain't aimin<br>and so you'll all know that in 1863 the<br>the crown invaded the Waikato by<br>crossing the Hmong authority and then<br>subsequently there wasn't around about<br>July June July and then our waging war<br>at places like a tiny ditty<br>storming into<br>while here - irony Althea - Oh Rocko<br>following a lot and then by 1865 the the<br>New Zealand settlements Act was enacted<br>there by confiscating 1.2 million acres<br>of Waikato mint and some of it was<br>returned later on but they were still a<br>whole lot of grievances that were caused<br>by doing that as well<br>that's it the scene that's what we call<br>robot suit or confiscation of my cattle<br>feed were principally by Governor Gray<br>in his colonial troops especially<br>Cameron and others in some of his majors<br>and in general they came in they took<br>the the feed who at one point two<br>million acres near by this devastating<br>white cut or the Kingitanga that in the<br>tiny people it wasn't so well the taking<br>of the land the confiscation of the land<br>was ultra important but what was also a<br>devastating effect was the psychological<br>damage that it did to the people so much<br>so that taffy out the second Maori King<br>in others sought salvation I suppose if<br>I go all other<br>ELA thought he defeated knew I'm gonna<br>run a phenomena or Manawa answered when<br>he went into exile and into the King<br>country and there's a whole lot of<br>stories that go with it and I think Tom<br>in Paul I will touch on a little bit of<br>that later<br>let's hit the scene then for the sim<br>Commission coming in and actually<br>discussing the confiscation of the lands<br>but by then the outbreak of World War<br>one<br>tatata I was over in England just prior<br>I was talking about those sorts of<br>things in actually Paul has done a lot<br>of research in their area what was<br>happening at home was a whole<br>groundswell of opposition really to New<br>Zealanders and in particular a Waikato<br>and King each other people participating<br>who<br>with the government of the time there<br>were some was in ten we that supported<br>the course the blood was boiling they<br>were the descendants of warriors they<br>were the descendants of those fellows<br>that fought in the New Zealand Wars and<br>they said no it's a battle we want to go<br>there was a whole lot that said hold it<br>there are huge political implications<br>for this and leaving the vanguard of<br>that was deep where Hillary princess<br>deployer was a first cousin to King<br>Kurata and a grandchild of King Tawhiao<br>who had suffered under the robots Prynne<br>sister pearl - were here and he led the<br>charge really she had just been recalled<br>about ten years before I had been<br>recalled back into her people by King<br>Maha and then took took a leading role<br>within the masa Nations and the workings<br>of the King eaten one of her sorts of<br>things was and actually she went out in<br>opposition to Nutter in poor money so<br>the thing about the war effort was that<br>in a European Museum view at that time<br>native people shouldn't be allowed to<br>fight in the European war letter and<br>poor mother actually petitioned<br>Parliament and petition government to<br>allow to extend that to Maori in altero<br>and that was approved so we weren't<br>supposed to be in the war in the first<br>place because we were European enough to<br>fight in the European war so then why<br>send our people to Beth why send our<br>people to battle was one of the catch<br>cross nutter and poor Polly said look<br>it's the price of our citizenship they<br>said things like hey we need to prove<br>that we are as worthy to be called New<br>Zealanders as everybody else in this<br>country to play I said I'm not buying<br>any of that thing<br>why should I send my boys to battle for<br>a government that only fifty years ago<br>stole money<br>why then should I send these guys to<br>battle for all of these in Justices they<br>haven't even started the discussions for<br>to rectify these these and justices for<br>the Rope platoon for the confiscation of<br>land so you can sort of see where both<br>areas we're coming from that's not to<br>say that some of the time we people<br>didn't want to go to do battle some of<br>them actually did and those ones that<br>did were supported to go but the point<br>of the players catch cries was all of<br>those they think that this is not their<br>battle come to me come to me at definer<br>it just out of Mercer their tip where<br>had a a bit of a settlement there at the<br>part led to ponder and then in 1916 or<br>where a 1916 conscription was born the<br>original Co pop of conscription was that<br>it wasn't supposed to be applied to<br>Maori it was only supposed to be applied<br>to the Europeans that were dodging the<br>war effort in their view then again<br>hakuna matata and Marley for money<br>petition that it be extended to include<br>Maori and so it was really Maori<br>politicians that dragged all of these co<br>papa<br>into the full view of the belt and so it<br>was and the Minister of Defence at that<br>time James Ellen wrote letters tip to<br>tip we're asking her to change her month<br>change your mind we're getting a nutter<br>was saying we're getting letters from<br>those guys at the on the front line<br>asking for reinforcements all the time<br>how people have died in Europe and as<br>Maori we have a tickler called you to or<br>to get revenge so we want all of our<br>people to go over and to to put<br>protection the act of a revenge for<br>these farmers that are dying overseas<br>and then James Ellen came to wahi and he<br>stood up and he said look why cut off if<br>you don't go to Benner and I'm<br>paraphrasing of course if you don't go<br>to battle now you can never sit with any<br>honor anymore well they're just brass<br>tip we're right off hey who is this<br>little puppy of Allah coming to tell me<br>that me and my people can't sit well<br>your honor anymore he said you must<br>fight for God for King and for country<br>she said I I respect the laws of my god<br>I have my own king and he'll stolen all<br>of my country no response so they<br>couldn't they couldn't challenge stiff<br>wear and then later on they came to<br>definer they had taken names off the<br>registration for voting the voting lists<br>the polling lists on 19:16 what was<br>against the law because people had<br>signed up with a confidentiality<br>agreement but the government thought<br>that they would use it for for anything<br>that they wanted to and then they bulged<br>it right up by not knowing who these<br>people were so they had a list of people<br>that they were coming to arrest at the<br>final they came to define it in June and<br>July and they came through and it was a<br>peaceful protest yeah all of the clergy<br>had abandoned too well there were full<br>of churches almost every denomination<br>was featured at the fine at that time<br>and then once the militia came they<br>scattered for the hills<br>and so tip we're turned back to the<br>primary net that was sought by her<br>grandfather falcão in Taranaki and use<br>that as an official unofficial<br>denomination and faith of the King he<br>talked they walked in they didn't know<br>who these people were they took the<br>wrong people they took seven away one of<br>them they actually trampled are on King<br>Tara this person<br>flag because it was put in front of his<br>youngest brother tero Wong and they<br>trampled across this flag and forcibly<br>uplifted him deep where's well later on<br>he became two players husband but to<br>walk a they thought was rowdy and so<br>they picked him up and left the brother<br>sitting there all of this happened at<br>virtual silence although way cut or<br>worth about all of the transgressions<br>that were being placed deep where stood<br>up and she said settled down and blessed<br>those that can come to take these boards<br>they were incarcerated at narrow neck a<br>narrow neck military camp and then some<br>of them were forced to put on the<br>military uniform those that they didn't<br>were freed<br>green and water and they were again<br>confiscation they got started out with<br>two blankets and there one was<br>confiscated and this was all in the<br>scope of punishment the people south of<br>nine were here were also affected so one<br>of our crew were from our particular<br>piece of paradise of the world natty<br>cookie was a man called utter turkey<br>Winnie connect a to tehy when the<br>Conscription came and was announced they<br>headed for the hills of nagato town some<br>of them were caught and were taken and<br>incarcerated on the horahora Bluff in<br>the prison system over there and they<br>weren't released until the end of the<br>war as well getting back to deep where<br>she would take parcels of K for these<br>for these but you know these rebels<br>these guys they didn't sign up to go to<br>the war effort and she would sit outside<br>the fences of narrow neck and sing songs<br>she composed the song called not our<br>opening talking about the constables<br>coming in now or who Necker after Papa<br>he wrote away cattle Guardino Cortina<br>and so today whoa<br>Tarot was taken by the people because in<br>jus Anton conscription and that's given<br>us a bit of a I wouldn't know<br>I suppose into the past the boy would<br>sit outside the gates and sit outside<br>the fences and say to the because they<br>were locked in their barracks and there<br>were only allowed out because no one had<br>inside toilets at the time and so though<br>I only allowed out to go to the<br>ablutions outside or the funny be me<br>when they would come out the player<br>would say kakakaka ma no one we just Aki<br>I'm wondering and just hearing those<br>words and seeing tip we're gave them an<br>extra charge an extra way to a charge<br>that they would that they would never<br>you know placate the requests of the of<br>the people there in the camp so they<br>made all these excuses to keep going to<br>the for Mme to the tortoise that saying<br>was brought back into the Waikato and it<br>was placed on a funny in 1918 and that<br>funny in still state well the<br>refurbished funny and still stands at<br>Magna totally Mar I was in natty kuroky<br>and it's called 10101 doing based after<br>two players caught it off outside the<br>fences and Neroni and so those are<br>symbols those are living symbols of the<br>here and now that remind us of the past<br>that has come that came into the way cut<br>these guys were let loose after the<br>after the end of the war although there<br>were some especially there the<br>constables and Auckland wanted to punish<br>them even further by continuing their by<br>continuing the economy but actually our<br>government passed legislation that the<br>Mounties were to be released right at<br>the even though the advice of the police<br>at the time was to keep them<br>incarcerated and to continue the<br>punishment because they felt them not<br>going to war<br>endangered other people and then<br>actually went to war and say they will<br>do what they were<br>whole lot of these types of things that<br>actually led up to World War two what in<br>the between World War one and World War<br>two there were a whole lot of<br>discussions a whole lot of negotiations<br>oh gee I didn't think I speak for 15<br>minutes there were a whole lot of<br>negotiations and by World War two the<br>negotiations had advanced so far that<br>the player said they're who they here<br>here are negative energy to puck on a<br>height equal to those that want to join<br>the war effort go and there were a<br>number of 39 s and the 28th Maori<br>battalion from the way cut off that we'd<br>a way to to Italy into to other places<br>like Egypt and things like that and I<br>just wanted to leave you with some of<br>the thinking of deep where not only<br>wasn't about the confiscations of the<br>land not only wasn't about the<br>devastation of the people but her<br>grandfather had also said but the<br>picanha innovateher named water quality<br>kita kakihara cake go to a for karlip<br>ära our Maria today<br>cuckoo Toto new couch warfare in this<br>land is like a wizard flex Bush knows<br>that there's they participate in war<br>after this they in turn shall suffer and<br>so tip where said I'm going to take that<br>as a feel forbidding anyone joining the<br>war effort so there was a whole lot of<br>things there were cultural reasons there<br>were political reasons there was<br>leverage reasons to prayer was very very<br>instant hello<br>rangiku and Athena are moody a kidney<br>the [ __ ] afar Drita got a Guerrero a<br>daily tena koutou<br>Cara<br>they're not other Tanakh where are

from the<br>foil and the importance of that queer at<br>that time and all that she said ended<br>informing much of what the King etana<br>is doing today and through too much for<br>my hip hockey hockey and I wrote this<br>book with my ear 2-tuple with a a DVD<br>and in this book we talked with the<br>Farne of Terre Ezra we said youngest<br>brother of the MALDI King as Roth we<br>said didn't want to go not because he<br>was afraid of going or not because of a<br>religious conscientious objection but<br>because of what happened with his tupuna<br>and to a certain extent in that dynamic<br>continues to happen today so in this<br>and one two three four five six of<br>waikato Maniapoto who decided that they<br>would join the war effort and that they<br>would go to the first world we have this<br>color here which begins my ear my<br>attitude my ear my yet at the fetal you<br>hide in my coat though we feel we heard<br>him Michael to eat the vibhuti knuckle<br>you had a Michael to eat or cultural<br>cocoa sermon or a condo motto monoi<br>tonic algae here fun fun I might eat<br>okey how me who you died and it's about<br>propitiating or satisfying a spirit Ezra<br>we said earlier 1863 among Authority is<br>crossed like Waikato is invaded and the<br>illegal immoral actions from that<br>invasion still have their effect today<br>one of those effects as Larry said and I<br>won't repeat is with the four sections<br>and the actions of a number of young men<br>and other people we said you did this to<br>us<br>they are you asking us to come and help<br>you with somebody we got nothing to do<br>with how is that any since we won't do<br>it and propitiating that's spirit<br>there's also a group of people closely<br>related to that other group of people he<br>said I'm going like we mentioned these<br>are sort of a DNA this [ __ ] Papa they<br>say oh I'm gonna get oh I'm gonna join<br>it fight and there's there's no doubt<br>that there's a pool of the warrior<br>a breed to get in and have a script but<br>that can't be the only reason<br>later on we'll have a look at some of<br>the reasons that these far know told us<br>for why they're to Poona or how they<br>understand they're to praluent<br>including Appa brownie Eureka so the<br>invasion of way Cottle toed anger<br>through 1863 1864 and those<br>commemorations in 2013 so much of those<br>commemorations in this area well known<br>well commemorated but through the<br>breadth and length of New Zealand merely<br>a note in a newspaper on the television<br>on the radio<br>yet the commemorations for World War one<br>and all of those activities that<br>happened away from our doorstep way<br>overseas somewhere gains millions of<br>dollars and attention from our<br>government more about that later<br>and are we and Ottawa hung ecologist<br>that 1863 1864 those battles bring you<br>DD way adi raangi Alfia which wasn't a<br>battle those of you who don't know about<br>ringing Alfia was an invasion by around<br>about eleven hundred heavily armed<br>troops with Kenan on a village<br>peacefully settled just a little east<br>between charaluta and Cambridge of<br>it's called a battle over to or Arco<br>where 1500 of the best-trained<br>best-equipped military greatest military<br>force in the world at the time of the<br>barely prepared stand of about 300 men<br>women and children<br>they're called battles<br>so those commemorations in 2013 were not<br>celebrations they were commemorations of<br>activity that we see on our televisions<br>today happening in Iraq happening in<br>Syria happening in other parts of the<br>world and say cruel terrible but so many<br>Musil endures don't recognize that that<br>happened right here in this country<br>so King taffy our second Maori King in<br>1881<br>now he's mentioned it he decided that he<br>had the munna he had the power to<br>declare peace so at Padonia in August of<br>1881 King Tawhiao invited the crown to<br>come and he would lay down his arms<br>listen lay down his arms there wasn't a<br>surrender but all of the newspaper<br>reports talked about a surrender lay<br>down his arms and declare peace

work on King Bharata and<br>King Tatas visit to England in 1884<br>Tuffy L went to England there he sought<br>a result a resolution of the row button<br>wasn't even granted l knew an audience<br>with Queen Victoria sent back to the New<br>Zealand government told it's a New<br>Zealand government meta deal with the<br>New Zealand government 1914 King Arthur<br>takes a delegation<br>goes to England and is granted an<br>audience with King George and Queen Mary<br>what has said at that audience is not<br>recorded we don't know what they<br>actually said but they must have talked<br>about this thing so it's my assertion<br>that King Trotter was well looked after<br>thee he was well cared for and so he<br>came back to Althea one with this<br>feeling of goodwill to the British crown<br>while he was there naughty monopoly the<br>kumara were of two minds should we allow<br>our young people to go or should we stop<br>them according to Keith our feels weeds<br>should we allow them to go the gentleman<br>that whose family spoke with us in this<br>book every one of them had either a park<br>our parent or a park aha grandparent am<br>I not to support this side for this side<br>where am I to support this side against<br>this side so the comité were called a<br>meeting at a place booked damaja<br>between pure pure and mauka in the King<br>country their decision was let's wait<br>until King tell Arthur comes back<br>let's ask his opinion so he came back a<br>delegation from Maniapoto went to see<br>him and his words and Paul's grandfather<br>has a song written in his diary that<br>contains these words the words of<br>keratin math they hear hear<br>Marta Maya nama hooky - boy let it be up<br>to the individual let it be up to each<br>commitment but come back alive come back<br>staining don't come back in the box<br>or not at all so the the money a portal<br>tomar to lift it up to the individuals<br>whether they would go or whether they<br>would stay some of those many portal<br>individuals like an uncle of ours type a<br>para decided that he wouldn't go<br>then when a conscription came down on<br>them in 1916 on the Parker 1917 on why<br>capital mania Patil uncle toy hit away<br>in the caves and wait on when he heard<br>the previous word he left there with a<br>number of his cousins and went to<br>definer where he was arrested and<br>refused to take on uniform consequently<br>got locked up in Mount Eden where bread<br>and water were the fear and for what the<br>term you used earlier Monty had hard<br>labor<br>2014 as we mentioned earlier the world<br>war 1 commemorations in 2015 and Zach<br>Day commemorations we're talking with<br>the far note around about October of<br>2013 we came up with this idea well<br>let's let's do something in terms of<br>officiating the spirit in this let's<br>record it in a book and a DVD or hell<br>we only got six months Anzac Day we want<br>to put it on the shelves so six months<br>with this book in this DVD and some<br>other spirit must have been working at<br>us in order for us to have dinner by<br>that time unfortunately we only dealt<br>with one of the conscripts and six of<br>the young men that week so our book is<br>on six veterans one and I call him a<br>consequently proper team of courses<br>conservation I like to take on script D<br>better it has something of another ring<br>to it rather than being a constructor or<br>being conscripted a conscript team it's<br>always been of interest to me the early<br>day that deployer is recorded in some<br>instances including in waffle King's<br>book as saying Dan go but his her cousin<br>Gallatin said it's up to the individual<br>it doesn't make sense to me that she<br>would have said to the people don't go<br>but it makes sense to me that she might<br>have said utilize their own family<br>you're not going boy or those closer<br>you're not going you're not going our<br>troop when I've said this out to Vilnius<br>a day but I can't see you saying it to<br>the whole<br>to the whole nation so in in that<br>relationship between King Tata and<br>Princess Tukwila tying in with what<br>lobbyists talked about our call<br>continues Monti you'll work with the<br>ministry of culture and heritage for a<br>National Day of Remembrance for these<br>activities that took place on our<br>doorstep right at our back door we<br>commemorate and some of us actually<br>celebrate what happened thousands of<br>miles away from you and particular over<br>in Europe and in Japan and in the<br>Pacific but things that actually<br>happened here in this country so we<br>continue to push along with Ravi and his<br>work at Ottawa hanger College with the<br>students lead for our National Day of<br>Remembrance and seek the support of all<br>of those who have an interest and all of<br>those who might say well that makes<br>sense to me we shouldn't just celebrate<br>commemorate Anzac Day we should<br>commemorate the activities right here on<br>this land where the call was as a<br>Ralphie mentioned for God for King and<br>for country we have our God there for<br>you we have our King our country was<br>taken from us so those of use who share<br>our country today let's share and the<br>national day of remembrance of what<br>happened to you<br>closing before I sing my song these<br>books are available at the learning for<br>thoughts and some information and order<br>forms here should you wish to look into<br>one here arcade to be named a mama here<br>uber uber<br>helper he Kino he my old people say that<br>this is a song commemorating those who<br>were who did not go those who were<br>conscripted who were taken away from the<br>heart of their family and subjected to<br>some very harsh harsh treatment what is<br>this in my heart causing such anguish<br>perhaps it as a sadness for my beloved<br>separated and a far from me unless the<br>sadness unless the anguish afflicting<br>but now my keto type in the Kings<br>traffic the car with refinery talk and I<br>talk to what I wanted that's what I say<br>I could know if I could attend it out<br>then we have to Nate<br>Calcutta Dean rumbles there now quit<br>waiting I go in the world but to be able<br>to call them Dean rumbles put it out<br>there to walk hi cordial like them we<br>have to go<br>yeah quick tight I'm not going to be too<br>long because wines just stirred well<br>it's not a lot of scholarly piece it's<br>been intellectualizing about it there's<br>just a little little project of being<br>them probably didn't - and I know that<br>Mike's going to be speaking after me<br>he's got much more of an interesting<br>story but I mean last year Montillo a<br>year before<br>Monty contact me about this website that<br>they had at the MCH in New Zealand<br>history site and Sid only did wycott of<br>money a portal didn't support the the<br>war effort I thought oh no home in that<br>quarter I'm awake I thought you know<br>most families they grew up in the in a<br>twenty eight mark became but when we<br>were growing up in them I was actually<br>born on NZT and but we was we was<br>telling a story about our<br>great-grandfather today with Yamaha<br>brownie and equality now they all these<br>different names of brownie amma hunger<br>and Grandpop and so we was taught the<br>stories about him going to World War one<br>and coming back with them a war bride<br>and it was on grainy grainy and you know<br>inside so I knew that we I knew that<br>someone from money you put over into<br>winter World War one and of course I<br>knew the other others too and these are<br>just some of the images I've collected<br>there's a great site called here it just<br>heritage images online but also from<br>other sites I need the other families<br>they had gone home squeeze what honey we<br>is we hit that swing I knew that and I<br>knew that because they'll need to took a<br>new handle basically par here's this<br>monument and that his you know right by<br>the pipe topper with you so it's quite<br>in the prominent place bases monument<br>the displays that in omnia these lists<br>of men who went to World War one<br>and so I said to month no they've got it<br>wrong and so at the same time I start<br>talking to a relation of my dealer<br>burlington by the name of peter anderson<br>and if in some of you might know Peter<br>but he also was interested in that World<br>War one and starting to do some research<br>and I said tomorrow we should do some<br>research on the on the monument in look<br>at these names sorry Stan started<br>driving around and of course didn't we<br>came across in the papers past the<br>newspaper article about the unveiling of<br>this monument and so India it talks<br>about they took a collection in 1919 so<br>it's just after the war and that<br>monument was unveiled on the lymph of<br>November 1919 so it took a clicks and a<br>maximum up not iman you pootle and in<br>this flagstaff this monument was<br>unveiled and of course the local<br>pocketing said hey we'd better get our<br>act together because if marius are<br>showing us up and it wouldn't be talked<br>about nineteen twenty four twenty two or<br>twenty four that they actually erect<br>another monument in the end of the m<br>it's acquittee therefore for the local<br>returned servicemen so india talks about<br>paul muddy and was there it was Captain<br>Burke admit to Kappa from Ottawa<br>Artie he who will wear John hit have<br>been there Jennings a local MP all<br>coming to the nose so quite a stomach in<br>and so then we started looking at this<br>monument and we sort of realized here<br>these are all these names on the in<br>recognized son but sort of realized more<br>Maori names and that's what I wouldn't<br>be good if we got a whole collection of<br>all the military records cuz I knew that<br>at that time archives New Zealand had<br>digitized<br>the military courts good bullet ride for<br>its archive to learn clicked all those<br>monuments it as I said they got three<br>here more hunger through here Nick water<br>around the naquadah brownie young hunger<br>in typical you try and find half of<br>these names you can't find them Lucci<br>records and so that so Peter I decided<br>like we're going to do a bit of a bit of<br>research and try and figure out all<br>these<br>names and try and find out the the<br>enlistment age of course father<br>the issue was they love them were<br>underage and said they made up these<br>names or they just had just made up a<br>name on the day so for example my uncle<br>and his brother we are my hunger he<br>called people Sonny about 13 or 14 I<br>made it all the way to London is you<br>talk to named George Nichols in the you<br>have to look at him and there's a oh it<br>looks like a boy you know but others you<br>know you say I mean it became it was<br>actually we did the same as I sort of<br>Christmas break in some of my partner<br>would see me played on my phone which<br>was basically on holiday are you doing<br>more research turkey problems but you<br>know we became fish neighbor some of<br>these characters say you know in the way<br>we actually sometimes was just pure luck<br>we use [ __ ] Papa sites [ __ ] up up of<br>books you know sometimes I've recognized<br>a name because I recognized you know<br>here's the Ellis's from cup of three<br>I knew that company some was a man who<br>to host up with others was me my new<br>enemy say being sort of thing all of us<br>Sydney Ellis I talked to the one damn<br>April Herbert from the multiple news<br>month away Ellis she gave me that name<br>she also said that very Ellis was Percy<br>Percy other so it was Percy others so I<br>did a bit more research I said she see<br>those three brothers<br>Oliver Percy in Stanley she said Percy<br>in Oliver and this is new family history<br>we'd walk<br>Stanley sort of went north wing Bush I<br>said well that's strange because Percy<br>had children in 1915 1916 1917 and 1918<br>so I'm not quite sure how he made it to<br>war and still hit those babies ensure<br>enough through the pit of research we<br>found Stanley Ellis was in England<br>writing to his father and I'm saying<br>that you know he tried to get the list<br>and in New Zealand couldn't get him for<br>medical reasons so took off to England<br>and listed there so net so there's great<br>sort of story for the family because<br>extend a sort of an uplifted this or the<br>manner of static sites what he went<br>bushes or took off but there are others<br>and actually Hickman father was was why<br>I was interested in it was quite a<br>personal project too because I have two<br>great brave brothers Olney<br>so today hit Yama hanger but also my<br>grandfather's and biological father<br>tummy all in the world in Thomas<br>Wilkinson because he was only 16 see all<br>these other names and the way we sort of<br>dead up was you through [ __ ] puppet<br>records but fortunately well they'd make<br>up their own names they never made up<br>the names of the Knicks that couldn't so<br>they tell you we looked up all the<br>August reform what sort of hunger all<br>the the wiesen it from tickle witty you<br>know and we just we used a location<br>around it around the area and also the<br>Knicks of kin and in we had mostly we<br>had luck it says it out your service the<br>idea was to pull together these these<br>are wonderful records is one we just<br>tell me our co-worker was his name on<br>the monument but his name I feel lucky I<br>found the [ __ ] book I said Thomas box<br>right in luckily he it said married<br>model and luckily he gave her name is<br>the Knicks of couldnít so we trekked<br>down Indian because it was a lot of<br>Thomas rights of me and so and then it's<br>about 95 pages his motor record because<br>most of its women when they come back<br>and they're trying to get pensions and<br>various things their shows on that just<br>this is my name but this is my name I<br>understood understudies all this true in<br>a firm between the various officials<br>about what name he came in there in the<br>third century so this is military codes<br>we have 95 pages but these are gain<br>wonderful resources and you can actually<br>access them online through our crisis<br>human so what we've done is we've<br>created a table we've got their rank<br>their name year they sort of unlisted<br>and in also linked it to the auckland<br>Cenotaph and yeah so there was about 77<br>names on their monument so 19 enlisted<br>in 1914 and just thinking about you know<br>so quintata<br>spec Monte and I were down at the down<br>at tickety you went to go and have a<br>look at the monument sure enough there<br>was a tummy on say we're having a bit of<br>a laugh Marty research methodology go to<br>the tummy first I can go downtown finest<br>even below here Monty you're on let's<br>how you do Marty history and then we go<br>now and spent the time with tough Appel<br>and it's a time at the monument and also<br>up at the Rue de pathways some of those<br>me in the bureau so yeah nineteen and<br>list of nineteen fourteen seventeen<br>nineteen fifteen cetera etc but this is<br>1777 recorder on there but we think<br>there might be others and so tom is a<br>car we popular and hidden Rita phone<br>both those men went to war in Tom can<br>guarantee that they have nothing money a<br>portal [ __ ] Papa so the question<br>becomes why wouldn't they record you<br>know record it you'd think that in 1919<br>they would have you know had plenty of<br>access to information and got it right<br>but I think Monty was saying there's a<br>number of me and they sort of drop off<br>say right Monty and various monuments<br>there were twelve that were killed and<br>one of the other things we're trying to<br>do is including the new tuna he actually<br>was killed the landing of Gallipoli on<br>25th of April 1915 so when Tom monsters<br>booked the ice into my image of of need<br>enough for that he should have been<br>tried a place they'd paid hundred<br>hundredth anniversary of his passing but<br>they're twelve they're killed and so<br>what we've never been able to do is just<br>identify whether buried whether they<br>have a headstone in fortunately these<br>some wonderful people they've gone round<br>and then taking photos of all those<br>headstones and then you can actually go<br>an exsisting online so we've got those<br>or if they've been kind of memorials so<br>yeah the twelfth nineteen money a portal<br>me in there killed and there was<br>actually another person who died not<br>long after the war as a result of those<br>um has<br>wounds so probably 13 in total so we<br>created this record it really just do is<br>are quite full for from not in money or<br>football and it's working with the trust<br>board but then when you read on the on<br>the monument talks about you know chiamo<br>on the England and then I think that's<br>quite important well the reason we<br>wanted to get those enlistment names so<br>we wanted to make sure their future<br>generations with no Nexus to the<br>emergent calls because the thing we just<br>tried those names on their on the<br>monument most of them they would never<br>be able to find the emergency so he<br>wanted the the tribe to have that main<br>retain their knowledge so we actually<br>affirmed seventy six names is one we<br>can't find his name Tommy love it anyone<br>know Tommy love it with we know that he<br>was born in 1900 we know that he died of<br>1964 we know that he was a truck driver<br>in the Auckland we know that he's buried<br>and waking with you symmetry we know<br>these buried in the RSA graves and the<br>soldiers great but he's got no hits<br>thing and we've been talking with the<br>family at Judge Stephen Clark it says<br>some to Pune so we've had everyone<br>trying to find them and unfortunately he<br>just he's not popping up so we know that<br>because he was 16 is quite that's wait<br>he must have been listed under a made-up<br>name so that's the only one we can't<br>find it's driving us crazy for Peter we<br>still fun Peters ideas just to go<br>through all the lists you know I said<br>are they I'm not there crazy but then we<br>looked at that monument in I think over<br>the years I hear a few kids are sitting<br>in sort of picket there you know the<br>lead and the names and you know talk to<br>kids and but only a sick you know if<br>you're [ __ ] Mohan anymore and in<br>Jennings the local theater at the<br>unveiling said this this noble monument<br>which had been unveiled would stand for<br>all time as a record of the splendid<br>deeds that have been performed it is<br>about reverence for the sex Isis that<br>had been made and Jack Phillips who's<br>written the book on memorials he's<br>recently supported out this project and<br>just mentioned and he also talks about<br>how rare this monument is because very<br>rare to find monuments of this light on<br>what I we recorded<br>all of the mean was posing all of the<br>men of the tribe that we'd Mostyn would<br>just record those who had passed away so<br>it's quite an important time reform<br>money a portal but as you can sort of<br>see it's you know it's the indentation<br>food but delete sort of um fully now<br>so the idea now we've decided is to have<br>the same and this is working with the<br>money portal trust board and<br>particularly the support of tougher belt<br>and and others as its to have this<br>monument time restored the problem is<br>that the so what they got to do is they<br>got a so hammered<br>re hammer in the lead and it's a dying<br>art form you know so you're trying to<br>find someone that's quite hard you ring<br>around or now we need to we need to take<br>it away as you can't take away the<br>monument Colin will take a long time<br>teacher a teacher we can do this but we<br>can't use it and so that sort of been a<br>project unfortunately world war one<br>there's a lotteries commission funding<br>and they'll put up two foods if you come<br>up with a food oh come back to it so we<br>put a application in and put it with the<br>support of the trust board<br>Monty says I've got plenty of money to<br>give away off and I see that note<br>because so hard to put application for<br>the paperwork so the trust will hit the<br>transfer money to itself to prove that<br>it was supporting the project and we<br>fought in terms of support of the public<br>trust the trustees of the Moy<br>the Trust Board and hopefully and we'll<br>have some good news in December and then<br>the plan is to undertake this week<br>watching any push you had to get free<br>crates I managed to get one full quote<br>was from a local integrity tryto dong a<br>Hamilton now we can't do it it was quite<br>interesting and say they think they can<br>do that work in January we did think no<br>should we hold off in have this restored<br>for the hundredth anniversary of this<br>Monument but you know some of those and<br>children of those being is still alive<br>but they're in the 80s you know you know<br>we want them to be there<br>then we Tom you know to for as part of<br>the occasion so for now let's do it as<br>soon as possible I did have another idea<br>is to take all those names of board<br>[ __ ] Papa but it's just it was hard<br>enough just fighting the D roof the<br>enlistment names next to something I did<br>for there are copper tree for the 20th<br>anniversary in talking about Tom he's<br>got my you t to power so mister my 82<br>birth to so they I think Tom's quite<br>keen on you know taking some of those<br>st. actually reading those military<br>histories researching their [ __ ]<br>poplar through history something yes I'm<br>really really interesting life histories<br>and how they sort of got there and they<br>thought in talking with various members<br>of the family say I think we're quite<br>keen to give all this information get<br>real over to Tom and you can go hard<br>with it I don't know this song it's just<br>something I found in my<br>great-grandfather's papers as actually<br>was how to actually find a lot of his<br>World War one material because anything<br>and the family head was a [ __ ] French<br>was pickup lines and French I think but<br>I think that yeah but one that we found<br>this recently found this song and it's<br>only part of the song but sort of kitsch<br>it's easy<br>look at that reads that reading you get<br>the seats so I might like to put a tune<br>to it one day so I might even remember<br>that'll change this<br>Oh tonight our time at making a haiku<br>you amou yada yadi cottony you who pay<br>Makino much ha ha<br>I am here to make our potent it's a hard<br>act to follow<br>my previous speakers and um and partly<br>to because on my topic is slightly off<br>from a topic we've just been talking<br>about and I like Roberts thing is ie and<br>now bring it all together about anything<br>I've got to be able to but so I have<br>just recently completed a PhD it was<br>around the governance models within why<br>cattle finery and as I was talking with<br>Ravi just before he says really so this<br>would be a nice surprise for Davi and<br>nama he kept all were cool when a [ __ ]<br>hi devotee now we'll talk that they for<br>they do not wear no koto ki I thought I<br>we a committee now hopefully when doing<br>night night authority neva so anyway so<br>plug on and I'll keep this short to shop<br>and then we can get here some food or<br>something<br>so the this others called it all here we<br>done got eaten or tato in one knee it<br>starts with this idea that we were<br>chiefly people in our time and this is<br>the same that's been attributed to<br>toffee on and so the idea was that we<br>were we were able to military we were<br>able to govern our own tribes in E we<br>and manage all of our own affairs in so<br>they our historical record proves that<br>we were able to do that and there's<br>heaps of bit of evidence around it the<br>second part is to this was capita for<br>the hiding our tikanga mati we and so<br>we're able to manager and stuff and this<br>is talking about process that therefore<br>in the process of managing our stuff<br>let's do it to the best of health<br>there we have responsibility to do the<br>best that we can and of course sitting<br>here's the tuple now we do Moo Tommy I<br>know it was a part of the King movement<br>and all the rest of it and just because<br>he's not see how I always like to check<br>in our to ponder who was a part of all<br>those prices nor either the idea was<br>that we were chiefly people second part<br>as we have processors that they'd sort<br>of mean that we can actually carry this<br>thing out<br>and the third part of it of that same<br>corridor was Cal monkey walk you're my<br>editor and my translation of it you know<br>be the literal translation be black on<br>the outside be white on the inside and<br>to me this is a sort of a moral<br>statement but that my translation be<br>Maori on the outside about be blameless<br>on the inside and so there's a moral<br>statement to us that even though you<br>know we are Maori but we should do<br>things right and be morally correct in<br>what we do and the the focus of my<br>thesis was around this this third part<br>and the guts of it came down to these<br>four things that I thought were the PO<br>Fatih Heidi or these these things were<br>evident through our history right<br>through and to the time when the King<br>Ethan I was established within wake up<br>and finally right through to values that<br>we should continue to follow in the<br>context of artico when I knew in these<br>very days and so the first one and these<br>are I know there are many definitions<br>for these for these values but keep it<br>nice and short and sharp then I've put<br>in so mono meaning power and authority<br>and leadership and tapu being spiritual<br>but also physical boundaries and again<br>there's a whole lot of corded or inside<br>of that who - which was important to me<br>that sometimes without you to supporting<br>Monday and tofu<br>if we don't have the power to bring<br>people to account or to reciprocate<br>generosity then manner in Tucker failed<br>and the fourth part of it was this idea<br>around Doudna and I've sort of chosen<br>that weird ruining over the word hooey<br>because because who he can be just two<br>or three people meeting together and I<br>wanted to sort of raise the discussion<br>to around this idea around how we govern<br>ourselves as a people<br>so the Kofun I knew it the Coe have no<br>new I know exists in previous times the<br>first comer I'm the new up and momoka<br>and then there were different places in<br>Cuchillo and Abajo ah bah bah Widow and<br>this one is the only remaining building<br>of the previous colony which was<br>established by to Putin okawa in 1917<br>and we have finite power sitting next to<br>Ma hooter in these the monument out here<br>but anyway we won't talk about that too<br>much but just to say and then we come to<br>you today's takeover on our new and I<br>know this is an old picture about the<br>structure within the Kofun I knew but I<br>just want to save three things one is<br>that we have our beneficiaries around<br>about 68,000 around seventy thousand<br>beneficiaries from wake up economy each<br>of them are able to vote for the arep<br>racine items through our mirai and then<br>what do I get together on our Kohanga<br>Nui and the Kohanga New Year's another<br>name for the for the Doudna and then<br>from there from their gathering we elect<br>our utter total which is the executive<br>body and that's basically and then the<br>executive body it takes responsibility<br>for the day-to-day management of of<br>what's happening in in the and on the<br>ground in a whole lot of different<br>sections and this is an old picture so<br>deals are is a expanded picture it talks<br>about all the activities within the<br>tribe<br>oh yeah so so with these tombs there<br>they're really complex situations but<br>the value the the the good thing with<br>the complexity the simplicity of these<br>statements they can cope with some of<br>the complexity and so for instance there<br>are moral and cultural interests I<br>create a choice in obligations within<br>within those things so the people I<br>spoke to and wake up thought I knew of<br>course the Kingitanga is very important<br>wonderful variety in terms of leadership<br>and the way that things have managed<br>saven as an employer with my cattle<br>timely monotonic our own personal<br>beliefs Manabu we have responsibilities<br>socially and culturally not only to our<br>Mirai but even to the wider context of<br>New Zealand Monaco Papa sometimes the co<br>papa<br>the manner of the co Papa is more<br>important than you know some of these<br>other mana and then the last one 1/8 our<br>family this idea that we have<br>responsibilities to the wider context of<br>New Zealand and then internationally so<br>you know some of those things might<br>include the laws of the land and<br>international treaties and all kinds of<br>bits and pieces but sometimes a person<br>can be fully accountable in one of those<br>areas but wholly irresponsible in<br>something else and so for instance our<br>person might think that mother [ __ ]<br>Heidi is the most important thing so<br>whatever your boss sees that it's the<br>most important thing they're about there<br>whereas other people might say no no<br>mana tangata is the most important part<br>of my then my belief system so I don't<br>key what my boss sees and I want to hear<br>what the Kingitanga sees I don't care<br>water all that sort of stuff if I feel<br>comfortable with testing that's it's my<br>mana is the most important the same<br>thing around Taku so hit up we thought<br>the King had Tabu thought the<br>hit up who thought their [ __ ]<br>Heidi so taboo can be applied in all of<br>those things too and the the the complex<br>thing about it is often these things<br>clash and so within wake up little tiny<br>we've had some doozy arguments based on<br>this idea about where the month at sets<br>and so at times you know if we think<br>about the the Kingitanga at times there<br>there are different sort of thoughts<br>about well you know hear me dough gave<br>me a nice little saying he says When in<br>Rome do as the Romans do when and wake<br>up Thor do as you're told and so so<br>sometimes you know and we're talking<br>about so you know so who's telling us<br>what to do you know as the King he<br>thunders at our elders is it our take on<br>that all of those sorts of things and so<br>we have minato-ku to and then it's all<br>put together under this idea of Luna and<br>this idea of you know where in terms of<br>governance governance is all about<br>accountabilities you know you receive<br>ports you sort of sign them off you ask<br>questions you work three through those<br>things but in terms of but those<br>accountabilities do have cultural values<br>and so you know my my argument is that<br>minato-ku - and this idea of Doudna<br>are all important aspects of what it is<br>that govern our ourselves and all of<br>them moderate the power in different<br>ways and so when mana you know some<br>people claim manner in particular<br>instances then if that contravenes taboo<br>then there has to be some sort of form<br>that sort of works through the process<br>to say whether you know that manner is<br>more important than another or a board<br>important importantly and the top of and<br>so do know as a part of their process<br>and then there were some of these<br>principles that I thought they were<br>important that sort of fell out that out<br>of that and out of our historical<br>context<br>number one was mayhem a hair or tongue<br>on what they eat my hair you know and<br>some of those sort of corridor had come<br>down through various kings so for<br>benefits the people do it<br>[ __ ] pop of principle it matters who<br>you belong to<br>and I say getting involved in some of<br>these discussions with some way cuttle<br>binary to be weh couple Tyner is<br>important part he can will he keep their<br>so being present matters been at the<br>working bees helping out with whatever<br>needs to happen is important and that<br>sort of contributes to their the<br>governance of our of our a we and in the<br>donut IDO principle that we want our<br>leaders to lead we want our leaders to<br>be people that make decisions indecisive<br>so what so what does it matter you know<br>the first thing as I've said these<br>values are evident in our history and<br>they've provided guidance for our people<br>for centuries sometimes we don't have<br>the confidence to say well you know we'd<br>rather get in some high-faluting new<br>consultancy group to sort of lead us<br>through the stuff but our people have<br>had these principles and I think that we<br>should turn to them more and they're but<br>they're dynamic and they're relevant for<br>today and so you know there's a it<br>provides a frame framework for us to<br>work through the tension between the law<br>and the law for example the legal rights<br>of the of the Kingitanga you know it's<br>in it's in the Act that's in the rules<br>of the Kohanim new but we still unclear<br>as demonstrated through our court cases<br>about how that sort of Wolfensohn it<br>gives us some guidance around the roles<br>of leaders you know donatina have mana<br>but the people also have mana the co<br>popper has mana and we need to have a<br>process again to work through how that<br>how there works it gives us ideas around<br>dispute resolution now no i'm sort of<br>throwing these out but i've no i haven't<br>thought through exactly how all this<br>works this is where my PhD finishes it<br>gives us ideas around strategic<br>direction because they place values that<br>are important to us and so you know at<br>times we think while the money is<br>but I can't see you know it's a part of<br>what we what we're trying to do but it's<br>not everything because that manner is<br>balanced by the top moon and it's<br>balanced by the seats of o2 and it's<br>balanced by the people sort of say no<br>this is the way that we want to go and<br>then the last thing you know it gives us<br>guidance even around this idea around<br>the the tamaki claim so there are issues<br>about mana there are issues about<br>topping there's issues about who to and<br>this idea of looting again so a couple<br>tiny if I could just say a couple of<br>small things one is that so i set and<br>two came along anew for six years<br>there's a writ for our for our mirai but<br>the first thing is that we've got some<br>awesome people in white couple tiny and<br>you know i don't know the more but I've<br>met quite a few of them and we just got<br>some really good people doing really<br>good stuff from social environmental<br>cultural programs these things and<br>they're not even being paid for you know<br>that sort of stuff just people saying I<br>want to do stuff for my father<br>we've got a whole lot of people being<br>paid to do a whole bunch of other things<br>too but I just sort of say in the heart<br>of the people there it's good and we're<br>learning from our mistakes in sort of I<br>take that apart from where fewer court<br>cases and I see that we we have God we<br>have our ups and downs but I think our<br>ups and downs are sort of leveling out<br>as we're going along so I feel confident<br>that you know we've got some ups and<br>downs to go through but we've only been<br>there for twenty years trying to trying<br>to work this stuff out and so you know<br>hang in there farmer we're financially<br>progressive you know we're we're doing<br>well their way and so we're managing our<br>resources and we're trying to build<br>rebuild tribal systems you know hapu<br>Mariah development cultural development<br>and meds we've heard recently were<br>expanding into Tamaki now just taking<br>so<br>that hasn't been submitted that's the<br>rejigged would always say you want all<br>the details on the summary the whole<br>thing all right any other fiqar or<br>thank you for your picados very<br>enriching a nice for me a couple of<br>things I pulled from Alyssa said trying<br>to treat the more together first the<br>importance of us knowing our history hmm<br>endeavor it's far no histories - we have<br>our histories in the very rich the<br>complex the multi-layered a hapa history<br>and our history - we need to know that<br>to guide us today<br>interesting leave you've done from them<br>to us the place of the Kingitanga how we<br>have most respect for the Kingitanga and<br>the importance of our well car we re<br>keep the importance of the attorney from<br>the path to guide us today and also with<br>our people when we have some differing<br>views it's all right what we do is we we<br>call it all we come together we mediate<br>and we negotiate our differences of<br>opinion and we work together so that we<br>uphold the moment of all not Temple on<br>the mantel of others<br>so we have our processes for resolving<br>disputes and they were robust they're<br>effective and we need to remember they<br>thought of a - also for Mike's point I<br>think you're saying about you know<br>there's four poems but I believe those<br>for power coming out in the corridor<br>without the presenters they're talking<br>about mana we're talking about Dublin<br>who - Andrew Noah and how people made<br>decisions how people govern themselves<br>how they make decisions about we will go<br>and fight it will the one only works<br>hmm but that was over to help people who<br>are governing ourselves as we did<br>for thousands of years today that<br>effectively but it's important that we<br>remember what's going on my mama taught<br>oh okay whatever a pattern it's<br>important we remember for today so I<br>fully totoko water on high water on the<br>I is doing and what Thomas Corridor<br>about exams well everyone else's<br>Corridor about we needed day of<br>remembrance that we not only remember<br>World War 1 then B's wars we fought and<br>died on overseas but also what's<br>happened in our own backyard that's an<br>important part of our history that's an<br>important part of nation-building New<br>Zealand our own psyche as well in our<br>own identity again that's good Maori<br>governments but punished so we have<br>Mike I think you give one more round of<br>applause</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
