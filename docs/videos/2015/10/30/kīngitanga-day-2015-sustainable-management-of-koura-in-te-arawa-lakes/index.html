Ian who saves a recent graduate of<br>ours recent PhD who works for his own<br>business en tu sabes and associates and<br>he is going to be talking today on on<br>cooter freshwater crayfish got their<br>monitoring their management sustainable<br>harvests that sort of thing he was going<br>to be talking with Willie Emory today<br>but will he couldn't make it so it's<br>just Ian that's going to be given the<br>tall one request just an install we'll<br>wait to looking for for questions just<br>so he doesn't lose its low and we'll<br>have a lot of time for the Intel<br>question so I'll hand it over to you ah<br>Julian 10 I coach like at all night I'm<br>Katella mean I come up with tena koe koe<br>quarry in cassettes talking or called<br>tiata wakil 9240 tour now II we know my<br>hiding my key tenet to Tonga upon<br>a key nah coda in adult or a ottawa so<br>welcome to my presentation today on<br>sustainable management of code and<br>chatter lakes unfortunately Willie<br>comité or will he marry couldn't make it<br>he's he's busy with lots of other eerie<br>engagements so he passes on his<br>apologies he assures me he's not out<br>fishing or collecting coder so we'll let<br>him off so here's a little critter we're<br>talking about today I'm talking about<br>coda also known as Qi and parts of New<br>Zealand this is the northern species or<br>piranha flops fennel fronds which is<br>President Theodore elects historically<br>was a very important food source for tea<br>Ottawa I was used it wasn't just only a<br>staple food source but I was used for<br>trading with EB from outlying districts<br>as well it's a keystone species which<br>means<br>a crucial as an animal it's crucial to<br>the way anika ecosystem functions so<br>ecologically very important and that co2<br>a lake skoda recycle a lot of the<br>detritus on the lake bed they influence<br>the invertebrate species present on the<br>lake bed and also plants there there as<br>well however there's anecdotal evidence<br>that current numbers have declined<br>dramatically since European settlement<br>in the late 1800s and this has been<br>attributed to eutrophication water<br>declining water quality the introduction<br>of pissed and plant species such as<br>trout which prey on Kota and aquatic<br>macrophytes the big oxygen weeds which<br>can affect their distribution and<br>abundance as well in 2006 30 hour late<br>settlement neck was enacted and this<br>empowered to Ottawa to manage the<br>timeless species which coder one of<br>those species and to bring in their own<br>regulations in their own management<br>plans so there's been a revival and<br>interest in harvesting coder and other<br>traditional species and the tiara leaks<br>so but however it's really hard to do<br>fisheries management plans when you<br>don't know anything about the animals<br>that you need to be managing and so the<br>lot of this work is Ian said as part of<br>my PhD study so the aim of this part of<br>the study was to examine catch rates and<br>biological traits of t-ara bekhoda and<br>recommend set sustainable regulations so<br>the first thing we had to find out was<br>what was the best method to sample coder<br>and many parts of lakes around the world<br>it's quite easy to sample khoa and<br>streams but in late it's quite<br>problematic we went through a whole lot<br>of different methods we use spotlighting<br>or rum or kotah we use<br>driving transsex etc underwater cameras<br>and these baited traps and there's one<br>up here on the screen modified G minnow<br>trap however they all had problems with<br>those methods the spotlighting scuba an<br>underwater camera methods all visual<br>methods a very highly variable the bias<br>towards large individuals you can't see<br>the real small ones the visibility<br>dependent and a lot of the lake's water<br>conditions these algal blooms the rest<br>of it makes it very hard to see things<br>and I limited generally to the shallows<br>particularly spotlighting but even scuba<br>when you're diving at depth and the<br>tiara leaks you're a thousand feet above<br>sea level you do get issues few people<br>they've got the beans you're doing scuba<br>and the rotor release and it's generally<br>pretty specialist that's costly and the<br>scuba you've got off as well so it's not<br>something that you can easily repeat so<br>we're looking at baited traps as well<br>pretty much you get low catches again<br>the bias towards large individuals that<br>vary by stubbles male crayfish and when<br>they get stolen you there goes fifty<br>dollars every time it gets stolen which<br>happens more often than not and the<br>other thing about them you've got to<br>pick them up before first light and if<br>you don't the little ones crawled out of<br>the trips and when you gettin low<br>catches you need a lot of traps to get<br>any decent numbers so I'll just do a<br>billions career 101 here got a male and<br>a female yeah so you can tell the males<br>I've got these lumps on the back legs<br>and the females heaven unless you know<br>that when the females re so obviously<br>they're easier to<br>so anyways none of we tried all these<br>methods nothing was really suitable so<br>we were looking around for another<br>method and I was talking a hunka love<br>mine and he said I why don't you use the<br>traditional Tokyo Dome method and he<br>referred me on two mar 20 Willie who<br>couldn't make it here today but Martha<br>Willie was one of the few people there's<br>only about three farming and all of the<br>central north island is still using this<br>traditional toko to method and basically<br>what it is is a whole lot of fern<br>bundles laid on the on the lake bed and<br>the kirov move into them and use them as<br>habitat so this is the traditional one<br>which was used in the old days and the<br>tumor was a big post was like a big<br>black mamba coo trunk it was put into<br>the lake bed and going round and round<br>with a walker sort of drilled it in and<br>off you had a flex rope with a pool or<br>float a little anchor down this end and<br>it just floated on the lake bead on the<br>lake surface and there's a pic a pic of<br>ur these flex ropes which the attached<br>to the wicking the Brecon foon<br>bundles so there was a traditional<br>method and this is a map from Don<br>Stepford landmarks of T Ottawa and all<br>these little dots here are our<br>coefficient grounds generally from the 5<br>meter to 10 meter drop off around near<br>all these ones around the outside and<br>there's a lot of real McCoy island and<br>they were all signified with these two<br>mu and they belong to far no and hapu<br>groups so they were sort of they were<br>owned those theories are owned and mean<br>so when Gilbert MIA captain guild mere<br>who was kept another flying key Ottawa<br>column<br>who did a lot with Tarawa protecting<br>Theodore after the invasion by Napoli he<br>was gifted one of these fishing grounds<br>and recognition of his efforts so I<br>think it was over 500 no and fishing<br>grounds and Lake Volta rule alone and<br>there was a picture there of a man going<br>out into the orchid ER makes you have<br>liquidity with a whole lot of fun to<br>replace the spoon honors toccata but<br>unfortunately you can't have those ones<br>floating around on the lake bed and the<br>old dayz I mean they were taking the<br>logs across the lake by boat crashing<br>into the two mu so a lot of them we<br>remove because they've obstruction to<br>vote passage and also when traveler<br>introduced it was made fishing a lot<br>harder on the lake so the modern they<br>tow kota works on the same principle but<br>we're using a sunken anchor line down<br>here and be using modern materials nylon<br>anchor rope we're using which is 14 mil<br>anchor rope it's relatively cheap and<br>it's relatively Hardy with a concrete<br>fill the tire as our anchor and then<br>obviously we don't use walker anymore<br>but modern boats we haven't gone up to a<br>bigger boat than this one now now<br>there's well either and pulling in a<br>turn bundle<br>so here's some of the nephews collecting<br>Breck and finding bundles out and a TD<br>they're ready to go into the code to the<br>toe and they bound together generally<br>ten to twelve Franz with cable ties and<br>then you end up with this finished<br>product was it pretty much looks like an<br>ice cream cone before the front looks up<br>at the top and then the stalks cut off<br>at the bottom here that's ready to go<br>those foon bundles are last so eutrophic<br>Lake about a year if it's a lego trophic<br>lake like Tyler widow raw tomorrow<br>chopped ball two to three years and you<br>can just go and pull them up when you<br>want so I just hopefully this video go<br>but just show you how show you the tow<br>so this is the bottom of a lake tarawera<br>those are common bullies is our firm<br>retrieving the line so you just pull<br>yourself along the main line the anchor<br>line here's a fern bundle coming up and<br>you see the Cobras oops whoops go<br>through that again it's not much of the<br>Cobras are all just sitting on the phone<br>bundle and we've been down the end and<br>looked at these things as they're coming<br>up and the co is generally just hang on<br>to that and see when they're just hang<br>on to that phone bundle until it hits<br>the air and just like a crab or crepe<br>Fassett you catch out on the and the sea<br>they once i hit the year they usually<br>drop your bait you know and jump off the<br>same thing of these so we have this<br>specially designed net you see the<br>Cobras hanging hanging on there or<br>through that bundle we've got a<br>specially designed net this one was<br>designed by Willie it's called a core<br>upper that's just shade cloth which is<br>pretty you know just cheap from bunnings<br>ten dollars we're meeting or something<br>on an aluminium frame that we get later<br>so we pull up the bracken fern bundle<br>the a wicker and the core up at the<br>shake it up and there's the colors smell<br>total weather behind it then that goes<br>back into the lake and you can go and<br>pick it up next month or the month after<br>or next month or there's a special Hui<br>your tummy hunger on or something like<br>that so yeah okay here so if you're<br>using than just a harvest coder you just<br>pull them up when you want them put them<br>back and replace the ferns after two to<br>three years so this method it's got a<br>number of advantages over the Western<br>methods gets a wide size range of coders<br>probably the most important thing from<br>seven mills ocl up to 50 mils ocl and<br>another Cobra 101 here the way you<br>measure Kota is from the back of the eye<br>to the end of the carapace there and<br>it's called the orbit carapace length 40<br>CL so a 7 mil coders probably about the<br>size of your thumbnail so right up to 50<br>mils like that Alan devs have stood a<br>PhD thesis and Dudley might even<br>remember and the 1970s mid 1970s and he<br>used beta trips smallest coder he got in<br>his trips with about 20 mils ocl they<br>can pet the l7 so he's missed a couple<br>of years of of cobra age classes up to<br>about 48 so the big slice of them to bed<br>but just missed the little ones it's an<br>unbiased sex ratio we're getting about<br>one female to every one male to every<br>female compared to alan destitute in the<br>same lake he was getting about three<br>males to every female because the males<br>are more aggressively they go into the<br>traps defeat how will we get a good<br>catch rate with the toe and raw TD again<br>our catch rate was about 27 to mean<br>catch burglars about 27 / wiki<br>compared to the baited traps which of<br>about nine<br>you're just going to remember the out<br>the alto is down there for about a month<br>to six weeks before you can actually<br>harvest it so it gives time for the<br>Cobras to colonize that human bundle<br>whereas the baited traps are just left<br>overnight so 24 hours so baited traps<br>have they have their use took a few<br>that's a present abstinence thing Al's<br>pretty cheap to set up once they down<br>there but pretty hard to find you know<br>you've got to find it GPS on the boat<br>really and another good thing with us as<br>well as you can retrieve them when<br>conditions are suitable so you don't<br>have to go with a beta trip you've got<br>to go and pick it up the next day<br>otherwise the beta starts interior<br>deteriorating in the and the co has<br>small currents move out this one here<br>just leave it down got on a nice day<br>enjoy it and the really cool thing about<br>this method it's a sustainable method<br>those foon bundles are actually working<br>like little hatcheries the juvenile<br>cobra go in there and they sit in there<br>and they they grow the females go in<br>there and they breed took me they got<br>their rigs when they got their rigs on<br>them so it's not only your not only<br>taking from the fishery but you're also<br>giving back to the fishery so what are<br>the existing regulations pretty much<br>bugger all really to be honest there's a<br>generic New Zealand wide limit of 50<br>Cobra per person per day you're not let<br>us l co recollected from the wild and<br>under the tra Lake Settlement Act and<br>the in the case of the tower lakes the<br>tiara Lex trust are empowered to manage<br>the cobra fishery here's a picture of<br>bar to a Willie and his look or Trevor<br>who helps us out which would say when we<br>do like let's work our monitoring we<br>always try and employ the rangatahi and<br>try and get them interested in science<br>environmental science so that's just a<br>typical catch off Willie's toe at<br>so sustainable regulations then that the<br>terror Lakes trust wanted I was actually<br>on one of the committee's and we were<br>wanting to to bring in a sustainable<br>management plan fisheries management<br>plan so what do you need to get<br>sustainable regulations but first you've<br>got to know what's out there how much of<br>it and if it's actually enough cover to<br>the harbor school size got to know the<br>sex ratio the breeding times for come to<br>tea is very important and setting<br>minimum legal links the size of onset of<br>breeding which I'll talk to a bit later<br>on and others photo here is just of<br>engaging with the the kaitiaki around<br>the lake as well okay so what we did as<br>part of my PhD work we looked at chiro<br>populations and eight of the tower lakes<br>we had to tow coder and each lake<br>comprised of 10 Wickham so 10 fin<br>bundles on to toca and each length so we<br>looked at these ranged from the very<br>early go trophic late autumn are tighter<br>raw TT Rudy who wrought through right up<br>to the hyper eutrophic lake okaro and I<br>don't think there's anyone from overseas<br>here but yes we thought through a mixer<br>so what do we find so this graph here is<br>a mean catch per unit effort on the<br>y-axis so that's the mean catch per<br> wicked and along the bottom here<br>we've got the lakes ordered from<br>oligotrophic up to hyper eutrophic and<br>as you can see there's no real<br>relationship between trophic status in<br>and co r abundance you've got lots and<br>lake water mark of quite a few and Rudy<br>and then you got a lot of curries and<br>like rotten or so but if you look at the<br>biomass we've only really got<br>harvestable quantities of koda and these<br>three lakes here Rotom are wrought CT<br>and rotorua these other lakes here at<br>depth because the toker is set outside<br>the we'd beat so you pretty much looking<br>at seven meters deeper this doesn't<br>include the shoreline the shallows but<br>so a lot of these other lakes there's<br>too few coda to make harvesting<br>worthwhile or there's a lot but there<br>are small size like an orca T arms a<br>shallow site and the co main terrace is<br>so the sex ratio as I mentioned earlier<br>using this method we went through these<br>are the classes here number of car on<br>the y-axis pretty much every age class<br>is about 5050 male to female so the<br>curry egg Bering season this is<br>important when you're setting open<br>seasons or closed seasons and this is<br>the percentage of egg bearing females on<br>the y-axis and as you can see not much<br>happening in summer january-february and<br>March or even April and then you get<br>this big we actually get to peace<br>through May 22 August and then again<br>from September through to November also<br>from this information this Cobra always<br>there's always some code have could have<br>got eggs so carbon regulation most<br>fisheries as you release crayfish with<br>the eggs and so it's another and put in<br>there here's another izakaya just a<br>female current and Barry and this is<br>Cobra fecundity number of eggs on the<br>whites again and as you can see surprise<br>surprise the larger Cobra had far more<br>weeks and the smaller ones and this is<br>important if you're looking at if you're<br>looking at slot limits and trying to<br>protect reproductive output so the size<br>of onset of breeding is basically we<br>nourish ensure that fifty percent of<br>females are able to breathe before they<br>get into before they are legally<br>targeted so they have to reach a certain<br>size range and we did this for all the<br>lakes but this is just the combined<br>graph and as you can see fifty percent<br>here from this model it's about 27 and a<br>half millimeters ocl as the length we're<br>by fifty percent of females have bread<br>we do this for all the lakes and it<br>range from 22 millimeters and lake<br>wateree who up to 28 mills and lake<br>rotorua so to be conservative and be<br>consistent across the lakes and<br>someone's going out fishing we're<br>setting it the highest level of 28<br>millimeters or recommended then so we<br>look at the slot limit we also modeled<br>us in the future of Cairo harvesting<br>really takes off you might want to<br>protect those bigger females as well and<br>so having a slot lower it was quite<br>common and fisheries science so<br>particularly up to about 28 mills and<br>then again from 30 mom mills $39 up to<br>and above you protect roughly about<br>thirty percent of the reproductive<br>output of the current female current<br>population so there's another other<br>method set with restrictions that we've<br>recommended and discussed Firsters of<br>all is to limit the deep water<br>harvesting methods to the use of the<br>toccata only there's a number of reasons<br>for this as I mentioned before the Tocco<br>is a sustainable harvesting method that<br>can enhance the fishery as well so to<br>give given a take sort of a thing the<br>toe coder can be controlled by the tower<br>lakes trust because it's a structure on<br>the lake bed it has to be registered<br>with the lakes trust so they can control<br>where they go they can as part of the<br>permit regulations you have to a<br>fisherman has to give his harvest<br>information as catch information back to<br>the lakes trust so you get a feedback<br>loop going so the fishermen actually<br>helping the trust to manage the fishery<br>scuba diver we've had some problems with<br>scuba in the past with some of their own<br>people actually going in and collecting<br>koda and selling them off they actually<br>were prosecuted by doc but<br>on those open lake beds as you saw on<br>the video Kyra just sitting there<br>and to catch and sell we also<br>recommended that you don't want<br>commercial commercial made trips to be<br>used because they're difficult to<br>control you know you did catch<br>information coming back from the<br>fishermen and also the potential vectors<br>will ply of an animal piece for example<br>a lake by cutting Moana as thought that<br>legre siphoned major one of the problem<br>oxygen we it's got into white carolina<br>on cobra trips so i just going through<br>the conclusions and recommendations we<br>found harvest will quantities occurring<br>and three of the eight legs there's 15<br>late sort of given terror rui so we have<br>actually got work plan to look at the<br>other seven lakes and to see if our<br>regulations and policies are suitable<br>for those remaining legs as well so<br>might it have a different size at onset<br>of reading or fecundity or breeding<br>seasons as well so they might have to be<br>might need these own specific<br>regulations we want to maintain the<br>existing regulations so a ban on the<br>commercial sale of kota collected from<br>the lakes there's also another issue<br>there a lot of the lakes are very<br>heavily influenced by geothermal<br>activity so a lot of the chiro collect<br>bioaccumulate mercury and arsenic so if<br>you were wanting to sell them you're<br>probably you probably wouldn't be<br>allowed anyway are you maintain the<br>daily bag limit a fifty curry per person<br>per team with allowance for customary<br>harvest which would be permitted by the<br>tiara elects trust so for tongji hunger<br>even the pork I or something like that<br>up to a thousand Kohaku day but just on<br>the payment system like they use it the<br>in the marine environment so you<br>restricted deep water harvesting methods<br>to the use of the Tokyo only I just<br>talked about it and they're taking a big<br>bearing females<br>and restrict the tokura harvesting<br>season to the first is and Semba to the<br>31st of March now this is kind of<br>interesting because uh sir peter buck<br>rate of paper in 1921 on the fishing<br>activities of T Ottawa and they actually<br>had us almost the same season they had<br>it from first the November through to<br>the end of March as they're harvesting<br>season for Kota and lake water ruhr<br>because obviously because they were<br>trying to protect those co-winner<br>inbreeding time as well so that matches<br>up really well and the minimum legal<br>length of 28 mills ocl we actually been<br>out with a lot of the fishermen and<br>we've got a big fish box of coder and<br>said hey what's the smallest co you<br>would take home to eat and pretty much<br>it was around 30 millimeters oh CL and I<br>just like to say that all of these<br>conclusion these recommendations have<br>been adopted by the tra Lex trust and<br>the committee hiding so hopefully<br>we'll have those and neck that very<br>shortly we sort out a few legal issues<br>so that's it and so that's all I'll say<br>Oh another as part of my PhD study with<br>David actually co off on a lot of us<br>work as well we looked at the co<br>populations in those different lakes and<br>looked at a whole lot of environmental<br>variables and pretty much anything<br>around Mount title Witter the eruption<br>1986 blew up and put a whole lot of fine<br>mud and a lot of the lakes and the<br>further you get away from the mountain<br>the moment you get the sediment and the<br>late leads call so and that's the main<br>drive of code abundance same New Zealand<br>overseas river in these Lakes as the<br>amount of course substrate late<br>Rotorua's really shallow and you get a<br>lot of wind blown over it and that<br>lately its substrates from about from<br>yeah from the shoreline down to about 15<br>meters are really cool and they just<br>love it another cool substrate where you<br>get a ton of wit and you go out at depth<br>to 30 meters just it's like quicksand<br>yep<br>good Christian now what we did<br>subsequent work we ran those lines out<br>to half a kilometer off the island so<br>right out into the deep deep and the co<br>right out right on on the edge of those<br>that half kilometer out so the substrate<br>is basically if the substrate is good<br>they'll be there I've mainly around that<br>drop-off area like like well through is<br>so shallow you you know as you know<br>you're going to walk it a long way to<br>get 25 meters but the wrong that<br>drop-off we've got more work plan for<br>late world to rule as well with the<br>they were traded down that dried and<br>preserved yeah but they were<br>translocated around a lot of whoever<br>moldy went really same with khaki lose<br>them around the lot and from what I've<br>read<br>yep<br>oh yeah definitely particular if they<br>were leaving them for that big closed<br>season and leaving the females under<br>stoop to breed and the juveniles to<br>really coming back again and November<br>and starting to after the end of the<br>breeding season it was it's one of the<br>few fishing methods it's actually<br>you could but you need a lot of them I'd<br>say in there there's a lot of coder<br>around the shallow and the shoreline<br>around title winner because it's where<br>the waves go that's windswept and that<br>substrates of course but when you get<br>out there deep and where we scuba dive<br>down all these towed lines to check that<br>out results with you know married up<br>lazette what was actually happening on<br>the lake bed here and it's you dive down<br>your toko a line and you see nothing<br>it's just mud mud mud and then you'd see<br>a log or a big rock or something and if<br>this car is just all over deputy so you<br>could view yet enough of them overseas<br>that they to enhance crayfish numbers<br>they just go and dump a whole lot of<br>rocks and and the lake or some habits of<br>logs or whatever it is give them habitat<br>particularly important if you've got<br>introduced first predators on the white<br>perch or even tuna to know really good<br>yeah it's good foot that's why there's a<br>lot this was such a strong to codify Sri<br>in these Lakes is because of the absence<br>of those opportunity eat a lot of color<br>as well but a lot of bottom feeder they<br>really chasing real fish in the middle<br>of a watercolor most of time they do go<br>yeah the tuner can't get there from the<br>sea it's partly life cycle they have to<br>go to the sea debris to know there's a<br>a lot of those ones in the streams<br>escapees people have let go but they're<br>not naturally they can't get up knees so<br>there's not those huge numbers of tuna<br>you get down the wake of the room a good<br>example we've been doing some work with<br>Neve are over the past couple of years<br>and the Waikato River hydrant links<br>which used to be full of Kota and the<br>commercial eel fishermen have been<br>putting in two million raft roughly 2<br>million elvers a year into the seven of<br>the Hydra links and now you're pretty<br>much hard-pressed to find a car in the<br>white couple hydrate links but you got<br>into the tributaries where there's lots<br>of rocks and cobbles and stuff and the<br>I at anyone can apply yeah too bad you<br>have to cut it on the lakebed something<br>likely anything on the lake bed now you<br>need a permit from the tiara legs trust<br>I had a bunch of questions as well I<br>thought I'd better go down superdrug<br>booth oh don't worry what does Cristina<br>supermoto insulator yeah first of all<br>freakish I have been they were very<br>important in the Scandinavian countries<br>in Northern European countries and also<br>through to Turkey most people most of<br>those indigenous people use baited<br>minnow trap sort of structures over the<br>but I have done some research and two<br>parts of Asia they did use not brick and<br>fern but something very similar like<br>brush to catch crabs and shrimps but<br>though as a sort of a method that sort<br>of died out overseas moldy have kept it<br>going around the central North Island<br>lakes anyway ya think everyone agrees</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
