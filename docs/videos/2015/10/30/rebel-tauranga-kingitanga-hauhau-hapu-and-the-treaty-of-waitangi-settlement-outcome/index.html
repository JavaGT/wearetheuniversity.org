haven't<br>quite prepared what I wanted to do this<br>because I changed things but really what<br>I had it neither the thing i was looking<br>at only knew he said and when we do<br>seven that was the only one I know where<br>as a year we went to the Hubble how<br>whatever got on so I'm looking I'm<br>looking at the bell when he may have<br>sailed within 12 30 2012 13 and then<br>looking at some of the documentation and<br>how they distributed the money in in<br>junk back into a little bit of<br>historical context why there was<br>difference between Hubble myself I<br>actually was involved with a husband was<br>first about you covered we did the first<br>lot of you came under the change in<br>there we retrospective claims to 1840<br>but it was a sort of containing the<br>proposed boundary extensions or the tone<br>of the city out into the rural area the<br>sort of wild river or better if you're<br>thinking of buying either side assault<br>and then so basically thoroughly with<br>him the money and that was at that time<br>they dated in the 90s take a look<br>straight ahead cuz they they used their<br>own money I think million or to<br>Hollywood strength of settlement so the<br>crown for part of the money and then we<br>struggle it beginning try deal here very<br>little and I think that provided a<br>couple of researchers<br>royal in the beginning Joe Williams they<br>might need my key and then clarifies<br>rental trust come in and that's when<br>they started opening up and provided<br>funding for the claims and their<br>empowerment that took to cut us be the<br>small forest this image was taken by<br>Teufel our ancestor who was shot behind<br>puddi puddi and as the booklet of dreams<br>they said the National Library are we<br>the turbo lively and the bus so called<br>taken by Gilbert Mayer and he's said<br>that he shot the person very nice grew<br>civil war story but in a report at<br>another time Michael it they about many<br>times who was that it recorded something<br>different then I picked it up from Judy<br>benefit then he a local about the core<br>TV I feel that there was prone to<br>exaggerate so and what it is it's sort<br>of what the heat ever hold a word to him<br>already governor gray tom says that<br>there must be the Catholic asked them<br>what religion would this be and say<br>could cut all of them is quite important<br>because there is hot with entire over<br>who accounts so there's a little bit run<br>hope you have no claim this belong to<br>the cupola arm from not even claim that<br>it belongs not yet on you so this is the<br>settlement package and then you ask the<br>question why the diversity and then<br>simple answer politics I know now that I<br>won't go because I was involved in the<br>whole claim process I think that the<br>trash Trevino was there 1994-96 year 96<br>was the second stage and then people<br>started setting a really long process<br>you know when you've got that money yes<br>so next what I'm sort of when I I'm<br>interested in I said I know the reasons<br>but I want to try and separate dishes<br>what's up and then this is the total so<br>they say a wide million-dollar date huh<br>boo anything I sort of go back to this<br>is the width or settlement package and<br>you can download all the lot of this<br>stuff on it's all online if you want to<br>explore and this is from the document<br>because the earth to have to ignite your<br>way in nineteen Tucker they didn't have<br>a history involved in their own country<br>but i'll talk about there in seven<br>verses in the document crown talk soon<br>rd tucker they were actually just the<br>Hubble though there are pili narco of<br>get shot if I see here in her room but<br>their daddy Tucker where where is common<br>and her room a lot of hub who had happen<br>and that's how the distribution of lane<br>was based on on huh boo it's you know<br>sort of late to you and there's no<br>statement for Margie way and in the<br>crown makes the apology to to all those<br>huh boo I mean this is sort of standard<br>settlement speak and then these are some<br>of the Y claims different hub ahead but<br>it's part of because you had a long they<br>started only ninety ninety eight to two<br>thousand and five six tribunal process<br>so a lot of dynamics and what a changes<br>it is what this really reflected because<br>when far no responded to<br>I suppose the report there was<br>derogatory to their ACS that and they<br>they they x bucket Tucker and then they<br>went on a whole claim and the tribunal<br>set on so that's how it is and then<br>allows you you don't see an answer why<br>there but they come under the umbrella<br>of late i'm on a waffle but i'm one of<br>these guys on dealing than once RMA is<br>about you know truth and factor<br>Westerners just say when dude people<br>create themselves or establish<br>themselves or where long is that we<br>still need to to establish themselves<br>though all those sort of questions and<br>then this is the eighth Hubble people<br>here familiar with Toma the yeah I<br>suppose I better do the obvious and then<br>so terrigal became supporters Oliver the<br>key to the through historical a<br>relationship with March ahora the wild<br>raw of dance ahora because when large<br>ahora we're dealing with mother two of<br>them around along the weather calls in<br>the hood at you from killing any raw<br>Hamilton here down to color pillow even<br>larger hole basin Tom ahead a method in<br>it moga cover in the the whole okie<br>people were forced by total monopoly<br>whether muskets were forced to the<br>weight of the river and then now Jehovah<br>didn't have access to baskets does<br>everybody need the baskets and then<br>Saturday we'd to the foot of the time I<br>I won't come off after how lucky what do<br>20 who left about<br>total in daily area tuaca ross<br>established matter mother that's where<br>the water law and then they went to the<br>foot of the highways and the character<br>flex over into a mocha rule and that's<br>where the relationship started and<br>interim had came over and helped wahala<br>went over to wee-wee so this is sort of<br>a lead no link has always been closely<br>with what we know in the quintanilla<br>certain working coming up yeah so that's<br>where the relationship although supplier<br>who has a fighting chief of of later<br>only eight eight states in the 1830s<br>1840s he was close to two further fell<br>on like all those fighting Chiefs<br>interfere the Phil I have a heart early<br>and caught him by Ramon just forget the<br>date 1844 in Oakland ending to pyar was<br>invited so they sort of gives you an<br>indication of the relationship so when<br>he tampered with formed an especially<br>put of the role of damiana corona with<br>it so desu terribly so in part of the<br>invasion of way couple starting from Tom<br>Oakley coming right through to all our<br>home and then the truth winterthur over<br>some of the terrible helloo specie pdy 4<br>99 though in the who lures right up<br>right up to the first part in the<br>interim a weird meta meeting but the so<br>they see anything so because of that<br>they delete the name was confiscated so<br>this is a report from Smith who was a<br>local government agent and you know this<br>is where the surveillance during the<br>period there's a lot of surveillance so<br>you look into their penises of the house<br>of journals as representative they<br>publish all these reports basically<br>surveillance of spies what the key<br>number people do what they say all that<br>sort of thing so this is where I deal of<br>surveillance come from and terribly like<br>wake up the half-wit here you two and<br>half with they remain neutral or interim<br>ended<br>use the work Cooper peruse Queen means<br>queen or loyal or friendly as officials<br>or so and then the red sort indicates<br>that then you knew how goo who so the<br>official series are definitely between<br>the west and the east harbor that like<br>that I mean in learning you know you<br>happen although the happy one named he<br>is just all the different settlement if<br>you notice this area here there's those<br>settlement Lee so this eighteen<br>sixty-three 64 this towards kuch khatti<br>area because what what had happened<br>during the mustard I call it the more he<br>wore this June 1830s there people<br>clustered their calling and power in the<br>central part of Tarawa so that's what in<br>you notice there was standard pattern in<br>a lot of our do that area and a lot of<br>other tribal areas because if you out<br>out on the frontier you're vulnerable to<br>the attack sir so 20 years like any<br>other thing was trade with Oakland and<br>so on so this and then so you had the<br>Battle of a book a hidden in a deep are<br>in April 64 tadano followed a large<br>Schloss unprepared and then they have<br>Hall of the later on you surrender and<br>then so grey attended it and promised to<br>take court of their lands and return the<br>rest and then and a lot of them they<br>were called surrendered rebels they had<br>to plead allegiance and then basically<br>when you recorded your in the<br>goodgrounds good books and eligible to<br>let future leader distributions and then<br>straight after December 1864 pioneer lee<br>was born to the como by nazi hawa indeed<br>because Poe material became the toffee<br>are went to see two in the come<br>that and then it's free became no space<br>or religion of Vicki Needham so this is<br>a that just showed the it's a ski trip<br>but the brown area south of it was posed<br>bottom part is all that will the hover<br>hang up and there was a large net done<br>or around the area and I will show you<br>another snippet so you can see this side<br>here that's the no party area has all a<br>wake up to win in Acapulco know if the<br>King country and then includes some of<br>her okie people because in that they<br>1864 268 a lot of naughty ho oh ho ho<br>honey idea so naughty however cool papa<br>and that was common in a waiter that<br>they do us a lot and that's how we a lot<br>of the but I and where will the bits a<br>pieces of laid within the Rope hunter<br>that's the source of the where wife<br>Ethel had remaining land within the loop<br>of urea so with the wake of the<br>settlement what they did they had a<br>compensation court in a very short time<br>people who have freely took a crown if<br>you rebel you hadn't surrendered you you<br>couldn't apply and then you made<br>application signed a document and then<br>there was a hearings in range from Nora<br>wahoo to to Auckland and distributing<br>the confiscated land 22 I suppose freely<br>wake up the enteral is a little bit of<br>different process that supposed to<br>follow the conversation court matter<br>didn't took a couple of years but it was<br>sort of quite nice e in the initials of<br>that there was drawing up the catechol<br>ed cunha they like a tiny cheeks went to<br>Oakland and then<br>I did ideal and then we gave those<br>blocks to the crown in the payment very<br>much what's happening if you see in the<br>Reno commode then there's a 50,000<br>confiscated block in the other here is<br>what they called return lands but then<br>when it happened is that when they<br>started surveying because they serve<br>these didn't know where they were going<br>he then speak some of the Hubble special<br>ed taco and their meats God sense of in<br>the Tommy Hunter was organ as the<br>cucumber go-between between thai rama<br>and toffee our viewers and rather pull<br>tight here he was trying to lobby the<br>crown you know bring some sense into the<br>process while people just were rushing<br>so he represented the kingdom of with<br>photographer so this is one letter but<br>he uh he died they'd here walking from a<br>macabre too big I way I had a key I only<br>found out I did some work with are<br>Jehovah a new settlement why he was here<br>because he just lived over the hill at<br>the foot of the Como's just partial co<br>well if you know the place and way had a<br>Kiki and some say he's buried it ed this<br>is sort of a statement this is where<br>this whole if you look go through<br>documents you see a whole it basically<br>to deal with people who were resisting<br>to story there was that my words are put<br>down and then you state the robbery<br>statements about them so here with their<br>calling now let me know you happy<br>although then that you notice there's no<br>reference to revenue that they are<br>inferior hundreds of night alone and I<br>always keep them of the state of base<br>image so there was a common you go<br>through all the documents and those sort<br>of sentiments were with sub will go you<br>know to say they're not very intelligent<br>you know that's why they know Colonia<br>the Chiefs data leaders in a very 19th<br>century hierarchical<br>intelligence take that so you can see<br>that yeah this is the same actually so<br>that's what the piggy like who disrupts<br>the survey that was ton of a groupon inc<br>this is sort of just a map showing the<br>what I didn't say is they straight after<br>by generating 65 all people who<br>converted to key number two ho ho they<br>are we retreated to the bushings in set<br>up their kleiner all around the bushes<br>it set up a bit of a robber Oh cut see<br>you know nobody was too okay and yeah<br>you know they play wanted to enter the<br>area so very much a similar principle<br>war was happening with all their poor<br>time and then so this is with the pity<br>darko another hub aware notion and this<br>is in like 90 a year away mobile it is<br>the claim and then when it happened<br>starting in January 1867 a militia from<br>one readout had a risk warrant and they<br>went to this coyote d Hummer Andy when<br>they entered when you naturally you know<br>they they say they stumbled when they<br>entered in it the men and the Nicoya<br>they noted only they turned around the<br>fire and a British military person was<br>shot is a memorial there to him but he<br>the captain of the truth from the<br>readout was rector handed and stood<br>there because he wasn't supposed to do<br>that but that started a massive I<br>suppose warfare which you don't read<br>much about it you see it in chat with<br>we're all look ho ho khana were attacked<br>in<br>the government started the boot earth<br>policy they destroyed everything another<br>people cool old people were left in the<br>different color and there's over period<br>you can see this is the trench they're<br>going up the military there was a<br>campaign for few months people disappear<br>in the bush in a few months later they<br>could see smoke coming from these kinda<br>there we established but but the troops<br>who were there we're british show the<br>river the redlands or the british<br>military callaway there's a force of 200<br>there was recruited so this is the start<br>of the cooper perforce there were from<br>mother to recruited by gilbert mirror<br>and william there and then surrendered<br>like that I new chief said there was<br>even a party popper chief on the crown<br>side there are two killers to him so<br>yeah very interesting in relation to<br>their time yes sir and then this is down<br>to the teramo showing where the military<br>and everybody was established and then<br>what the crown did is compared to wake<br>up all that they absolutely confiscated<br>all those settlements within that over<br>to area interim a part of Grey's promise<br>they gave the pop-up eyeing this day and<br>then so if you go to a number of special<br>there any new my life you know that you<br>see a pie in the neighborhood sapir will<br>be living there three four five hundred<br>years and then this is part of the brown<br>is the brats they were given back to the<br>help of but what had happened when they<br>started whether the toner districts<br>lady's age 67 68 the form commissioners<br>who was run like a native land court<br>wasn't a land court and then they some<br>of the bureaucrats they gave distributed<br>to have you lean back to the Hubble in<br>individuals a lot of individuals and the<br>likely in the wake up the friendly all<br>got a lot of blocks together throughout<br>the urea and then this is the inland<br>area and then about 1880 80s early 80s<br>the Commission study here in all these<br>blocks by then species pity da da da da<br>dong energy panel resistance had sort of<br>tapered off and people were entering the<br>area so even after dating seventies<br>people were being chased out of the area<br>by ho ho ho with their guns one of my<br>two bullets was he had his name in the<br>paper his name was marker or talkin so<br>but what happened here so this side<br>you've got yeah it spooky know you've<br>got way to her so you've got later when<br>you have to hear that said only new huh<br>boo and then when it's doing the real<br>peppy research I sort of check out all<br>of us opponents everyone's totally the<br>document of all the blocks who gave it<br>and you can see in the note that on your<br>side you don't see too many strays what<br>I call strange people who don't belong<br>to the happy but from this area right<br>through to the air you see a lot on my<br>cutting in the indeed if you know the<br> proper you know but what happened<br>because of confiscated that cash mekia<br>had been extinguished and so the<br>commissioners could allow anybody in in<br>the particular Hubble here Nyjah<br>pummeled a night only hub who claimed<br>they laid in other a bit of them to the<br>list so there was basically a lot of<br>light at only you know were helping<br>themselves that's a reality so that's<br>the background anything so I stopped<br>so the 18 by the turn of the 20th<br>century you get petitioners especially<br>coming from that margin only knew and<br>then death it is when they are saying<br>they are only new separate distinctive<br>from maitland then the citric acid<br>Commission came basically said total<br>confiscation was justified and and then<br>done you know especially lead by tub on<br>a lot so the late 19th century was PD at<br>our code there were sort of the<br>leadership in terms of trying to contain<br>I suppose the impact of the road katsu<br>and into to what land ahead left and<br>then by the 20th century they come on a<br>while where we're active and leading in<br>the yellow sort of doing putting forward<br>submissions and a whole lot of processes<br>of quite active so so when it comes so<br>the long he knew you so when we come to<br>the after the everybody waited till the<br>tribunal had done they do reports one<br>doing the historical area and the second<br>one report in hearings was more dealing<br>with contemporary issues and then<br>largely let me know spent seven years<br>trying to organize themselves because<br>one hopeful says I will at least started<br>way back in the 1990s they went to the<br>crowd so we want to settle as a hub and<br>then the crown was saying and especially<br>with the Labour government to have you<br>know you know sort of forcing people for<br>settlement into collective units whether<br>whether they mean though ideally they<br>want to tell Roman all the three we will<br>how many you either won at settlers one<br>but the species not only do you have<br>there were and you can understand if you<br>understand let me know helpful<br>they operate eerie they really are puh<br>puh centric so this is this is sort of<br>the tail end and then they did a<br>comparison but when I found it in the<br>settlement process in having been<br>involved in too yes there's a sort of<br>how can I put it it's very difficult if<br>you like myself you an anthropologist or<br>historian you've been disciplined you've<br>been trained and then you see a lot of<br>people coming up with statements but<br>that's the image of themselves in a<br>single this right but yeah they<br>protecting themselves it is the image<br>and the crowd except there's a little<br>bit and in a little bit so this is what<br>it is they break down treaty so really<br>so where you've got the variation in<br>what the distribution of the Hubble was<br>wellness is they be 50,000 acre<br>compensate cava skating area twenty<br>percent for the point of having hubby<br>purchase and other breaches but it<br>didn't really match and then<br>and then this is sort of the percentage<br>difference this is just the property of<br>the penny loco in a major quantum in in<br>may come on a waffle so the variation<br>really is where your hub who leads were<br>what the goodies were in the thing about<br>what about Oahu and others I I thought I<br>hate google earth you would have shown<br>it clearly in my account because I do it<br>in a class so you show where the<br>hydrating properties and that's where<br>the disparity between some of the hub<br>occurred and then so today i got this<br>last night who they define themselves as<br>that only knew the EoE you see tunnel<br>abajo seifish sea monkey tucked away in<br>the settlement received money and they<br>know how to as part of the leggy new<br>year we and then this is the trust would<br>originally the trust board when it was<br>formed was from quarter billion<br>settlement in the early 80s late 70s<br>early 80s they only had ten spaces on<br>the and then through the i suppose the<br>treaty claims process they extended to<br>cover all a hubble and then one hub who<br>they pick it up of a format i so i just<br>leave that tea
