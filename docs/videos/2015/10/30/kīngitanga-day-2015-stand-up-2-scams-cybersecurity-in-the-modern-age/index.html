to you on such a<br>special day for ty moon I ask you all to<br>please forgive the nerves and hopefully<br>what I have to share with you this<br>afternoon will provide an understanding<br>of how schemes actually and why they are<br>so successful I intend to talk about my<br>own experience I've tried to put about a<br>three year experience and to maybe half<br>of the presentation wasn't easy to do so<br>there will be lots of gaps and but I<br>hope you get the gist of what I'm trying<br>to<br>you today so in order to get to the crux<br>of this presentation it's important that<br>I go back we should have seen what you<br>probably know is that in april 2011 i<br>was arrested at I zsazsa airport and<br>Buenos Aires Argentina with five kilos<br>of cocaine concealed in a suitcase what<br>you may not know was how vulnerable i<br>was in the preceding months so<br>vulnerable that i ignored a number of<br>warning signs that i know at the time<br>they were indications of a scam hit me<br>know what I did know was there were some<br>bad things that happened across the<br>internet or could happen that you know<br>wasn't going to happen to me I also know<br>that if I'd not been in such a<br>vulnerable space then I may not have<br>fallen so deeply in love for the<br>charming persona called Frank mark Lynas<br>so how did this happen a multitask<br>getting a between I left a great career<br>and I'll tear door to move to be by my<br>far no and Brisbane in the middle of<br>2010 the next few months were spent<br>looking for work I was consistently told<br>I was overqualified for the various<br>positions i was playing for in over the<br>next six months i became more and more<br>desperate at the end of october a<br>well-meaning cousin of mine sign me up<br>to a dating site netcom I was not overly<br>happy with this and found it all little<br>creepy actually so I decided that I<br>would unsubscribe from the site my<br>profile was to remain life for a further<br>three days it was in this time that I<br>received a message from a very handsome<br>looking man his first Miss message to me<br>had me hooked like I'd never been hotter<br>before to cut a very long and sordid<br>story short I fell hard and fast I<br>should have recognized the grooming that<br>was occurring in a previous life I<br>worked with in Corrections<br>and I had minion an encounter with a sex<br>offender and opportunities to study the<br>techniques but no I had my rose-colored<br>glasses on we seem to have so much in<br>common although a lot of difference as<br>well which made it all so much more<br>exciting he told me only loved about 45<br>minutes away from where I was staying in<br>Brisbane he told me he was a civil<br>engineer his fiance had been killed in a<br>car accident some eight years earlier up<br>some years earlier and his mother had<br>worked for the UN and human rights but<br>had died eight years previously he was<br>an only child and had loved his mother<br>he had spent most of his childhood<br>living in various countries around the<br>world he was alone and he told me he<br>loved my strong commitment to my far no<br>and he could tell I was an honest person<br>with the same values as home he would<br>talk about how excited he was to be a<br>part of such a loving far known we were<br>meant to meet about a week after we<br>first started talking online however on<br>the big day he rang most up seek to say<br>he was going to Sydney for a job<br>interviewing of successful it would mean<br>a big contract in London he later called<br>to say he'd landed the job and if I<br>supported his decision to go he needed<br>to leave immediately of course I said<br>going he needed work he made contact as<br>with the benefit of hindsight I now<br>understand they find out what they can<br>about you via social media places like<br>facebook instagram twitter search<br>engines and due to my previous role at<br>the muddy language Commission photos and<br>stories already came up when my name was<br>googled probably not as many as come up<br>now so I'm being groomed over a period<br>of five months the journey consisted of<br>many highs and probably just as many<br>loads and hindsight remember we now have<br>this benefit his contact fell over by<br>Christmas and the first request for<br>money came he then begins to warm me up<br>to the idea of doing some contracting<br>work with her Moses PA really his fiance<br>he says how funny is that I think me who<br>has never held any intention of ever<br>actually marrying anybody again once was<br>enough in my book because if it doesn't<br>last for a lifetime then why would I do<br>it again however I was being excited by<br>the thought of this mean wanting to<br>marry me he even told me he'd seen a<br>wedding dress in the shop window that he<br>wanted to buy for me really sometimes<br>this benefit of hindsight it's not<br>really a benefit at all I think I'd<br>rather have amnesia for some of these<br>memories throughout january there's one<br>issue after another with his creep from<br>his previous workers threatening him due<br>to money they were owed through tongue<br>falling gravely ill and ending up in a<br>hospital and remaining there for three<br>weeks ensuring an ever-increasing list<br>of problems arising and figure II I was<br>offered a short-term contract back in<br>New Zealand timely really because by the<br>stage I had already sent most of my<br>savings to him by Western Union as soon<br>as I had never used previously to this<br>so job becca New Zealand meant I could<br>help to support him while he secured<br>another con<br>great so by the end of March he<br>convinces me to travel to South America<br>to pick up some papers for a new<br>contract he was being offered to do some<br>civil engineering type work for a<br>company who did check out when I did a<br>Google search however about six weeks<br>after my recent the company was no<br>longer listed so I make arrangements all<br>excited and apprehensive at the same<br>time I organized some work commitments<br>ahead and finally I tell my phone they<br>weren't happy about my going but hey at<br>53 no one was really going to tell me<br>what to do I'm going via Argentina so I<br>google to check out some information<br>about the country they speak Spanish or<br>a derivative of later I found out its<br>Castellano um so I think well I've been<br>to Spain I know hula I know a little bit<br>i'm only staying there for a very short<br>time so i didn't stress too much about<br>that haha again benefit of hindsight<br>meanwhile the love of my life continues<br>to charm me he tells me of the time and<br>we will meet for the first time how we<br>will spend our time in London before<br>returning with me to New Zealand of all<br>went well why wouldn't it go well we<br>knew each other intimately by the stage<br>we'd been speaking for five months in<br>she'd things I've never shared with<br>anybody so I arrived in Argentina and<br>here is where another level of the<br>Aquila bernis comes in originally only<br>stopping over for a couple of days at<br>most suddenly everything changes and<br>they want me to fly to Switzerland to<br>pick up some more papers then to travel<br>by train down to Madrid so feeling very<br>stressed by the stage waiting for the<br>papers to be delivered and then to have<br>the plans keep changing my stress was<br>skyrocketing and comes my Savior who<br>says to me don't worry honey<br>honey they they was a woman by the name<br>of aspirins of going Gomes who was the<br>secretary to the organization that Frank<br>was supposed to be working for they can<br>pick the papers up in Switzerland you<br>just bring the documents to London I<br>will fly to Spain sign them in return<br>and time for your birthday a week later<br>the night before my flight to London I'm<br>given a suitcase for the documents<br>concealed in the lining I questioned<br>both Frank Ennis forenza as to why the<br>papers are hidden they come up with a<br>variety of excuses in Frank tells me if<br>I'm really consumed honey then lift up<br>the lining and check out the documents<br>so with this response I think you're<br>just being paranoid Sharon because you<br>trust us me and he is telling you how<br>fabulous our life together will be also<br>upon my arrival he was going to take the<br>documents on to Spain sign the contract<br>and return to me within 24 hours so I'm<br>thinking well if he had anything sucks<br>in the bag then surely he wouldn't be<br>offering to take it on to Spain so next<br>day I turn up and chicken the bag and<br>make it through customs then while<br>waiting for the boarding announcement my<br>name is called and I'm asked to identify<br>my bag which I do and eventually this<br>all leads to me being arrested around<br>3pm that afternoon we didn't stay the<br>13th of april 2011 i remembered not long<br>after i hit the headlines both here in<br>new zealand and also an Argentine being<br>horrified at the headlines using such<br>words as drug mule not sure at that<br>point I really knew exactly what one was<br>let alone being accused of being one<br>such a learning experience and more ways<br>how did I get through being locked up in<br>a prison in Argentina I just want to I<br>digress just for a moment because this<br>morning I've SAT through two<br>presentations both about the strength of<br>our people of Marty people back in World<br>War one both about the strength of the<br>people here from the kini toner and you<br>know I think I've answered that question<br>that's in our blood the first few days<br>were like living in a nightmare foreign<br>country didn't understand what was<br>happening to me where I was being taken<br>while I was being moved from sound to<br>Salim what the other prisoners were<br>trying to say to me the day after my<br>wrist still in the same clothes<br>unshowered I meet with the public<br>defender and tell you what happened by<br>our translator so I tell all by the<br>stage all my worst fears were realized I<br>knew my father would be panicking as<br>they would have been waiting for my call<br>to say I was safely in london and that<br>by this stage my father had contacted<br>Interpol to us seem to try and find out<br>where in the world I was later that day<br>after hours and hours of repeating my<br>story the lawyers taken to the officers<br>and I'm able to phone my sister through<br>many tears she is relieved to hear I<br>have been arrested and instill in<br>Argentina because by this stage they<br>were friendship with worried that I may<br>be did somewhere and they may never find<br>me the next day was my birthday I turned<br>50 for heaven speed for previous night<br>and all of that day and a filthy cell<br>still unshowered in heaven to pee and a<br>hole in the ground in front of other<br>woman finally around 11pm that night I'm<br>taken to another prison processed and<br>put in a dormitory style unit with<br>around 30 other woman eventually after a<br>very stressful weekend I moved to unidad<br>Trent iuno a prison and I zsazsa where I<br>remain<br>for the next two and a half years the<br>first month was spent and another<br>dormitory-style unit with approximately<br>20 other woman the President had a<br>section especially for international<br>drug mules at any one time there were<br>around 60 international woman locked up<br>with the total number of woman in this<br>particular prison totaling around 220<br>about four weeks after my arrest I moved<br>to a pavilion with on average nine other<br>woman this prison are sorry I had my own<br>cell so after a month of shearing not<br>feeling safe my life being so very<br>public I felt like I'd won the lottery<br>to finally have a space where I could be<br>alone over the next ten months i had<br>many trips back and forth to court my<br>case was finally heard in febuary 2012<br>and despite the judges acknowledging i<br>was schemed i was convicted in sentenced<br>to four years in 10 months i think<br>everyone from my lawyers the translator<br>my far no embassy staff and even some of<br>the court officials were more surprised<br>with the judges verdict then i was my<br>lawyers appealed and there begins<br>another story of how different the legal<br>system and Argentina as two hours here<br>in New Zealand I won't go into any more<br>detail around it as i would need another<br>few hours to explain you'll have to wait<br>so finally after appeals and unresolved<br>legal issues with my sentence I was<br>finally able to return home leaving<br>argentina on the eleventh of oktober<br>2013 some 30 months after having arrived<br>my father meet me at the airport and we<br>traveled south to the Mona I had grown<br>up under despite having slept under<br>photos and postcards of Mona Taranaki<br>photos and post cards off and from my<br>far no and friends nothing nothing<br>compared to actually being with them<br>physically to be able to do the things i<br>would go to sleep at night dreaming of<br>doing simple things really like being<br>able to walk wherever and whenever I<br>wanted instead of being restricted to a<br>small outside yard where I'd walk around<br>and around and around in a circle has it<br>been easy since my release he'll know<br>that I think it would be hell no I'm<br>currently unemployed again but I'm<br>finally working on something I feel very<br>passionate about which reminds me that I<br>really thrive when I know my mahi may<br>make a difference do I get recognized<br>I've lost count of the number of times<br>strangers have said to me t I've reaches<br>somewhere before your face looks so<br>familiar I had it today and forgive me<br>of the person is in here I didn't tell<br>you sometimes I explain why they're<br>likely to have recognized me much to the<br>horror and embarrassment but often I<br>just reply oh I have one of those common<br>so while I've enjoyed spending the first<br>18 months since my return out of the<br>spot like a spotlight of the media I<br>always knew it would only be a matter of<br>time before that would change when my<br>scam at the headlines in 2011 I had no<br>control over how the media were<br>betraying my story this time I like to<br>think I do have some control over what<br>is told and how it is told when I was<br>contemplating going public again a very<br>wise friend of mine told me shares this<br>has happened to you for a reason you've<br>survived you now need to work to prevent<br>others from having to go through a<br>similar experience I know how hard it is<br>to go public particularly with armchair<br>critics quick to judge and condemn<br>however in many ways I am grateful that<br>I didn't have a choice as it has allowed<br>me to deal with the shame and the<br>humiliation and given me a determination<br>to make a difference one of the things I<br>was unsure about was how to raise<br>awareness how to raise a weenus by the<br>telling of my experience initially a<br>book seemed like a good idea I've been<br>writing a daily journal which totaled<br>857 full skate pages by the time I left<br>Argentina however I was not convinced<br>that this method would reach a wide<br>enough audience so the idea of a<br>campaign seemed a much better way again<br>do I think this will be easy hell no<br>campaigns can take years to get off the<br>ground and I guess that worries me as<br>I've become increasingly aware of the<br>number of scams and skimmers that<br>continue to plague and claimed victims<br>every day since the Mirage story went to<br>ear in early July I've been overwhelmed<br>by the heartbreaking stories of victims<br>who have either made contact or have<br>been referred to me or whom I've read<br>about<br>what concerns me even more are those<br>victims out there who are too afraid or<br>too ashamed to talk about their<br>experiences we have to stop the shame<br>and realize that the skimmers are the<br>ones to blame not the victims Queensland<br>Fraud Squad chief detective<br>Superintendent Brian hey who has familiy<br>years been working in this area of work<br>has said that scans target people of all<br>backgrounds ages in income levels he<br>said everyone who is connected to the<br>internet was vulnerable to online<br>schemes particularly through increased<br>social media use it is the biggest<br>challenge facing law enforcement<br>globally in the history of policing he<br>said one of the greatest vulnerabilities<br>as our own behavior people post too much<br>personal information online it is very<br>easy to make yourself an unintentional<br>target simply by using social media mr.<br>Hayes said people needed to be more<br>cautious with the information they<br>posted online especially when using<br>social media you would not go out in the<br>middle of the street and give out a<br>dossier of your life to every stranger<br>that walked by you seed but you have no<br>problems posting it on the internet for<br>the whole world to see you are<br>constantly under attack from the moment<br>you connect to the internet and you may<br>not even know it you see it's part of my<br>huge learning curve I have developed<br>relationships for the number of<br>individuals and organizations who have<br>been working in the area of scheming for<br>a very long time one of these<br>relationships is with Nick safe New<br>Zealand and I would like to acknowledge<br>Chris Hales who is here today and the<br>awesome work he and his team undertake<br>the volume of calls they receive are<br>astounding last year on average there<br>were 22 calls<br>day over eight million dollars was lost<br>two schemers from New Zealanders and<br>2014 and this year is shaping up to be<br>even more horrific with the same amount<br>having been lost by the end of august so<br>with four months still remaining and<br>please remember these statistics do not<br>include what goes unreported so we can<br>only imagine how many more victims and<br>how much more money it goes overseas to<br>these skimmers as for the variety of<br>schemes a quick search brings up<br>computer virus schemes online trading<br>schemes banking of phishing schemes<br>computer hacking online dating schemes<br>employment schemes investment schemes<br>upfront payment schemes lottery and<br>competition schemes mobile phone flip<br>mate schemes holiday and travel scams<br>charity scams health and medical schemes<br>small business scams door to door skins<br>and social media schemes these are<br>likely to just be the tip of the iceberg<br>and while we don't have time to discuss<br>all these schemes today and how they<br>work I thought given my experience I<br>would provide a summary of how r 0 means<br>scheme swoop a Roman scam occurs when a<br>man or woman pretends to be romantically<br>interested in someone who is looking for<br>love or friendship on an internet dating<br>or social media site in order to obtain<br>financial gain the schemers generally<br>target those aged between 35 and 70<br>scammers copy and paste photos of<br>attractive woman and wealthy businessman<br>from anywhere across the internet and<br>present these fake profiles to lure in<br>the victims they use poetic scripts to<br>play the role of their own mentor sweet<br>kind caring and considerate lover the<br>victim feels that they've found the<br>partner of their dreams and the person<br>they want to spend the rest of their<br>life will and will go to great leads to<br>be with the one they love once the<br>emotional attachment is strong the<br>scammer claims misfortune and<br>amenah a car accident a mugging a<br>hospital inpatient loss of wallet in<br>paperwork money needed for the business<br>sick mother sick child needs medical<br>bills paid booth degas tuition fees or<br>their hotel was boot down with all the<br>people we can belongings now destroyed<br>they will appear for Lord and encourage<br>the victim to help them financially by<br>making money transfer through one of the<br>major money movers like western union or<br>moneygram and ask that it be kept quiet<br>for fear of embarrassment to the<br>victim's family upon meeting you the<br>victim feels uncomfortable at the speed<br>of the developing relationship case but<br>develops a strong emotional attachment<br>to these sweet words of love family<br>members may become alarmed when they<br>discover financial transactions taking<br>place between the victim the manipular<br>schemer in the victim's family sorry may<br>become critical of the developing<br>relationship the relationship teams to<br>become secretive and a triangle develops<br>between the victim the manipulative<br>schemer in the victim's family the<br>schemer will attack disapproval by<br>introducing doubt and will answer with a<br>question or just drop out of the<br>communication of confronted most victims<br>find it hard to resist the pull towards<br>the schemers seduction and due to the<br>heavy pattern of romantic attention the<br>schemer has created and many will lose<br>financially before their illusion is<br>broken or arrested as in my case often<br>resulting in a physical spiritual and<br>emotional breakdown a Roman schemer we<br>use any type of communication to carry<br>the game such as Facebook whatsapp email<br>phone text 30 sites dating sites yahoo<br>groups forums some portraying themselves<br>as victims of scams police or political<br>representatives in military personnel<br>with regards to dating sites currently<br>the dating site owners are asked to<br>display warnings on their site to that<br>scheme profiles however many either<br>can't or don't want to recognize these<br>fake profiles many are not fully aware<br>of what they are complying with as<br>administrator select the knowledge or a<br>part of the marketing to pull and more<br>profiles for membership or advertising<br>purposes some dating site owners appear<br>to have no problem operation fortunately<br>because there is nobody policing them as<br>we were made aware with the Ashley<br>medicine scandal many dating sites have<br>fake profiles and that many dating sites<br>pay people to develop these fake<br>profiles I believe the fight against<br>skimmers is really only just beginning<br>we need to stay vigilant and we need to<br>keep talking about these issues and<br>ensuring we are all keeping ourselves<br>and those we love and care about up to<br>date with the schemers and their latest<br>victims so in conclusion this campaign<br>is about standing up to schemes and<br>scammers by shifting the spotlight from<br>the vulnerable to the corrupt by<br>achieving this I believe more people who<br>speak out publicly about their own<br>experience without being vilified by the<br>media end or the general public this in<br>tune will increase awareness simple<br>really<br>so how can you help if you're on Twitter<br>please

you have questions for Sharon and<br>mounting them for now we'll be chairing<br>I killed a tatto a whole ordinary DNA<br>key to kingdom Taylor to hate here there<br>Mickey far no Tina Cotto 4918 a dope we<br>make little mad at over 90 no Martina<br>Cotto tnite Cotto tuna tartar Kaltura my<br>name's on Tanith here on base yet like I<br>saw teachers clean to psychology here at<br>the school psychology from them thank<br>you photography for the callout been for<br>San for hosting us and also to Sharon<br>for your very powerful testimony about<br>your experiences very harrowing ordeal<br>I'll singing Bangkok Hilton you know<br>when you started talking about that<br>stuff up loving but um yeah this is a<br>theory I think grew topical issue that<br>will probably touch a lot of us about<br>most of us it's one degree or another<br>while rather dramatically clueless<br>before you go on your freedoms are<br>endangered just ask the smartphone now<br>he remembers this movie clean up the<br>Apes original not that you know the more<br>recent bollocks bathtub this is all<br>right i mean it was about um just three<br>astronauts who travel through time and<br>space to another planet will do they and<br>and then they realize that the rules<br>have changed at humanity no longer run<br>the place but was AIT's do but they<br>called message here or said there was a<br>new world order rules have changed<br>things have changed so in some respects<br>has crime this is what crime used to<br>look like once upon a time you know<br>which they've come out of these ideas<br>and tropes and and some of the stuff<br>still exists now but these days the<br>picture may well be changing to a<br>consulting a lot like this so more<br>connective we're giving and a lot of the<br>issues that Sharon mentioned before I<br>mean we're in an age of expanding and<br>continued connectivity engaging with the<br>new with the new media and a digitalized<br>kind of world so why should we care<br>about cyber crime or one because of the<br>stuff so commonplace there's lots of<br>benefits for us to access gives it which<br>is pretty much probably everyone in this<br>room but as long as there are people and<br>as long as your assistance then we'll be<br>opportunities the crime as well and so<br>the internet is a platform not only for<br>the commission of offences but also for<br>the prevention of offenses as well so<br>that the three big kind of challenging<br>areas like think this is just some<br>armchair music really around cyber<br>crisis fiercely to look at appropriate<br>legislation policy and law enforcement<br>practices to deal with these new types<br>of crimes these are the normal crimes<br>they weren't doing cybercrime back in<br>eighteen hundreds or let alone in the<br>1970s ilysies a whole new kinds of<br>crimes at least variations on other<br>crimes and a new kind of environment<br>also new practices and the friends<br>encryptions and criminal justice<br>agencies and sector as well as what we<br>can do as a public for our likely to be<br>the end users and maybe victims if not<br>actually offenders perhaps in this space<br>that's where otherwise so the first<br>thing we need to do is consider what are<br>the types of crimes I won't go through<br>this in depth because I suspect me in<br>the screw and probably have a lot more<br>knowledge of the Sierra Nevada about<br>time David wall who was a criminologist<br>for kind of came into the 02 ground<br>floor nearly 2,000 Fred with type of<br>typology so I'm just going to use that<br>just to make life a little easier that<br>same kind of forward general kind of<br>categories of cybercrime the first is<br>cyber trespass which is when effectively<br>someone crosses their board of ownership<br>into yours so hanging basically think<br>the place of kind of cyber trespass<br>crime also either to gain something you<br>have or to stop you think of something<br>the cyber to Sigma deception and theft<br>everything from piracy credit card fraud<br>identity theft and the notorious<br>Nigerian scams of course as an example<br>there's also cyber porn on obscenity and<br>which i think is going itself and also<br>cyber violence which me well and walked<br>and Sidious kinda crime said the<br>incident is now creating something of a<br>real divorce battle to fix so we have<br>cut a popular version of this which of<br>the captors sure learning to be but also<br>child pornography and the pre incidence<br>of maybe the growing prevalence of child<br>sex and fingers for access of victims<br>via social media records in so critical<br>malas needs who commits these crimes<br>when he's know something about who these<br>offender groupers and one of the big<br>issues worth cybercrime while i can tell<br>from the literature and talking with<br>those who are involved in this space<br>this is one of most of invisible<br>criminal groups that exist I mean my own<br>background for examples in criminal<br>justice our creations the teen years a<br>lot of my work was based on presents you<br>can spot a violent offender more or less<br>a mile off their revered Lee and<br>there'll email usually between late<br>teens and maybe late twenties off of the<br>history of violence may well be<br>associated with the criminal network of<br>some sort but usually in a way that's by<br>obvious choice accidentals have their<br>own paths of conspicuous sort of<br>telltale signs in some ways as well but<br>when it comes to cyber criminals who was<br>the spring secure and one of the<br>barriers finding out more about this<br>particular community similarly for the<br>victims and Sharon gave us a wonderful<br>according to about her experience is one<br>such individual but there are also bear<br>is too funny opens victims are one<br>because<br>the negative house for being affected<br>through these kinds of offenses may not<br>be worth reporting on so graduates the<br>point about underreporting certain kinds<br>of negative outcomes as a victim obvious<br>but what are the issues around who these<br>individual they victimize Carol Evans<br>hold it right how do we connect cyber<br>crime which I guess is kind of<br>self-evident this is a week we know<br>cybercrime bites of things through<br>financially loss through some type of<br>sexual abuse or emotionally<br>psychologically so I'm like we know<br>these crimes through their effects but<br>have to predict this kind of stuff and<br>how do we prevent it and on some<br>respects I think maybe more religious<br>not into prevention than maybe protect<br>you at this point so the remainder this<br>I just going to give a ridiculously<br>brief crash course in criminal<br>psychology character myself cycles not<br>to both psychology now typically this<br>will happily raise some of the issues<br>around by cyber crimes so difficult to<br>kind of tackle when we think about<br>criminal a criminal history for example<br>we optimistic privacy terms of actual<br>events prevention time however you want<br>to measure that just pretend these are<br>armed robbery occurs at this point I'm<br>another one occurs or the same person<br>maybe there's a series of this so we<br>have a pattern of behavior and we can<br>count those how to count cyber crime<br>someone sends off an email the offense<br>itself may not be apparent all days<br>weeks months later perhaps double<br>trouble the other thing we want to look<br>at with each of these businesses of<br>crime is discrete moments of behavior<br>what would features step up act around<br>that for the individual who committed<br>these offences so for example with the<br>seventh child sex offenders analogy<br>individual may be sexual arousal maybe<br>an absence of adults around they may be<br>the presence of a desirable victim<br>person maybe someone intoxicated doesn't<br>ever said behavior they made himself<br>engaging in self South talks and kind of<br>permission giving talk which some<br>reduces the distance the person may be<br>experiencing between a good guy because<br>about to be something with the<br>terrorists all just going to<br>the person tell themselves to reduce<br>that gap between who I am as a person<br>and what I'm about to do so these are<br>kind of stuff that we're psychologist<br>try and tease out when we interview<br>somebody but these kind of behaviour but<br>often this occurs close sentence very<br>difficult to protect a sex offender<br>before they've actually committed<br>offense at all that's what part of the<br>tragedy of this kind of work with stuff<br>in the lives of history of quite tragic<br>events we will start making surreal kind<br>of concrete credentials so generally<br>speaking with crime generally we look at<br>a number of factors please a little blue<br>bars surrounding me the big ones one of<br>the most reliable predictors of these<br>kinds of behaviors now a general crime<br>and this is where we might can start<br>asking you questions with our winner<br>this really applies the cyber<br>criminality strong predictors would be<br>if someone has attitudes or beliefs<br>which are supportive of criminal<br>behavior so I think criminal bait is<br>good for me for some reason another and<br>that's probably for me to stick close<br>and save yourself from committing an<br>antisocial and having people around you<br>who tested Lee or directly support your<br>and it choose all the more actions or<br>maybe appalled your behavior respect<br>someone over for example is equated with<br>job then that may actually reward your<br>behavior and your laws of a happy little<br>likely to get it in the future all<br>things thing England<br>probably the oldest psychological laws<br>of all it's a the best predictor of<br>future behavior past behaviors that we<br>don't think in the past and has paid off<br>at least someone or something has<br>intervened in our process all likelihood<br>robbery or whether that's the salt<br>requirement it's likely to appear<br>somewhere in the future all things being<br>and the the fourth water probably most<br>contentious this idea of antisocial<br>personality took up a little bit about<br>second which is weird a constellation<br>trait reasonably inoculum of themselves<br>but when I Suffolk clustered together we<br>have kind of a heating cocktail that<br>could be quite quite challenging to deal<br>them living for essential for the<br>history media social behavior the<br>attitudes associations and finality this<br>is an armchair kind of typology this is<br>a psychologist who masqueraded as they<br>van burren Somers Point decided right<br>leg so let's just make up the criminal<br>community are like an animal genus and<br>species evolved so we have normal<br>offenders these could be folk who offend<br>because they have some kind of survival<br>issue attention that they've been to<br>repeat with families for example they<br>they shop look at their role because<br>their impoverished there's a whole of<br>social drivers they might be informing<br>that there's almost a big group or eight<br>are innocent of crimes but have we found<br>guilty private room there are the<br>psychotic events those who are<br>suffer of schizophrenia for example<br>special to learn new stations this is a<br>very green group incidental I don't want<br>to demonize that grouping further affect<br>your chances of being assaulted that's<br>not verted very low sharing a bedroom or<br>someone who's psychosis for example then<br>someone who doesn't I think if your<br>dental insurance it's a really high risk<br>they'll sometimes like little sake you<br>go and then on the inherently what we<br>call the antisocial personalities these<br>are almost a pathologically different<br>group for some ways do those who maybe<br>have fun basic kind of character defects<br>like that predispose them to certain has<br>something that could be impulsive they<br>don't think things through very well and<br>that's the normal cauliflower behaving<br>so it's crime may be a side effect like<br>that kind of style entrapment there are<br>the so-called sociopaths who are<br>chronically antisocial largely to<br>perhaps to really screwed up learning<br>history and a whole lot of other<br>environmental factors that may encourage<br>that behavior so forth then we have a<br>big sexy proposed rate of the day for<br>so-called Psychopaths similar in some<br>respects of the sociopaths but there may<br>be some genetic component the jury's<br>still out on that but this is a very<br>interesting group but I wish intensity<br>of cyber pets mate there's actually<br>another group that we haven't discover<br>new species of offender perhaps their<br>turn you know exist somewhere out there<br>that we're just starting to discover now<br>somebody's exciting than somebody's<br>disturbing or is it that this group are<br>really a kind of a digitized version of<br>maybe there were these other cons<br>Academy<br>over here so from a risk assessment<br>point of view we need a model of cyber<br>criminality robust theoretical model<br>it's from there we can make predictions<br>those productions people develop tools<br>things that will make life easier when<br>it comes to protecting and providing<br>these kinds of behaviors the basic logic<br>of specifying risk just identifying<br>someone has simply outside their<br>criminal cause it really tell us very<br>much at all it could range from someone<br>who's maybe ripped off someone's bank<br>account waiting to someone who's been<br>preying on children and sexually with<br>the other end no one is actively<br>criminal to everyone at the time this<br>work this is the same for viola the<br>Phoebus section field as an argument or<br>so the criminals as well people have to<br>sleep for God's sake so it certainly<br>during that period is not a figure going<br>on we all sectors specify a prediction<br>is to have value what are the factors<br>that recurrence of person to act in the<br>criminal matter we often get us praise<br>that the criminal mind my argument here<br>I'm certainly opens are being educated<br>on this step we should just dispel all<br>notions of mind especially criminal mind<br>because we don't know what goes on in<br>mind but we do know what goes on with<br>behavior we can see behaving with your<br>measure that facility of mind is a much<br>longer Cabana anyone have a criminal<br>mind as such but that's what our minds<br>there for the fetus it's our behavior<br>secular offenses the thick of it here is<br>a type of behavior so these are those<br>facing front of David wall category as I<br>mentioned before those are the type of<br>victims so the Holy Grails kind of place<br>we might need to get to know if we're<br>going to get here with any real<br>certainty is this whole idea of a risk<br>parameters state if the following risk<br>factors in prison<br>those are forgiven individual DiNozzo<br>high medium or low prescriptive<br>probability that the person will engage<br>in some specific behavior romance scam<br>sexual predatory behavior online within<br>certain period of time but that's next<br>few months years that may place certain<br>victims at risk of certain top severity<br>of those outcomes so there's a lot in<br>there but that's what we call risk<br>friend of statements absolutely say this<br>guy that risk of doing some strip but<br>rather this is so many depressed I'm<br>doing quite a specific series of actions<br>that may have a certain kind of impact<br>on a certain kind of person so my last<br>night what does all this mean and this<br>is just again some more armchair musings<br>the cybercrime like other problems at<br>the very least appliance the edges of<br>what we really can tolerate is a society<br>that's a community because of the<br>pervasiveness spoke against it for maybe<br>the mystique equally convincing we're<br>still you can find out what those<br>boundaries are for us from our criminal<br>justice court of new protection<br>prediction and Prevention 3-pointer for<br>areas that overrated demand a lot of<br>attention and to serve wat roles but<br>these service providers will play<br>universities governor institutions as<br>well as broader community and so<br>organizations like need to say for<br>example and other kinds of groups may<br>well be doing wonderful those efforts<br>some interest such a you know put a<br>bigger picture view of that my self<br>sufficient in zeeland but this is also<br>more excitingly I guess without more<br>playing in the stuff an opportunity to<br>approach an explorer for future ality of<br>criminals now that we're moving to New<br>Age as a society may be globally was<br>that unfortunately because the baggage<br>of criminality there's an opportunity<br>look at the close of what that would<br>mean for us and by extension<br>now needs to be a citizen is cloudless<br>blue developing across society let's do<br>some big picture issues i'll leave it<br>there thank you for your time thank you<br>understand look for it increases my so<br>from here from the perspective of<br>someone who's been involved with the<br>crime and is doing something about it<br>from the perspective of ecology animals<br>the reason Zhane help an attempt to<br>address it so now we want to hear from a<br>computer sciences to speak up and that<br>is why we had a main boom just thank you<br>been here where was Peter yeah Kira um<br>yeah my name is boo yeah I like this<br>name because you know it's taboo name<br>yeah you cannot say this name or on<br>plane yeah please don't say okay yeah<br>scan up to scams thanks turn and come on<br>yeah to this a lot about scanning<br>Cybercom so I will not cover those<br>topics okay by the way I I just want to<br>conclude first I actually we should<br>introduce Versailles that let me<br>critical first I want to conclude that<br>technologies cannot protect against<br>scales<br>as far i wanted to compute these are not<br>smart enough to detect scams and<br>scandals okay why most people years I<br>give you some examples protection<br>technologies such as antivirus software<br>intuition detection system firewalls<br>those degrees juice usually they use our<br>signatures when I talk about signatures<br>actually I Anzhi begin that exists<br>patterns like patterns or identities of<br>contents for example then an Tavella so<br>they want to find a scam or email scam<br>okay it just check if this email scam<br>has pattern of scanning message or not<br>okay but I could say that scammers some<br>scammers and most of scammers smarter<br>than that okay they study how those<br>techniques work and then they try to<br>avoid being scan or detected by those<br>technologies okay let me ask you first I<br>show you this example I asked you first<br>this is the website of implication New<br>Zealand which one is the valid learn<br>sorry but most of you might might look<br>before and that's right for me I need to<br>visit this website okay yeah first time<br>I need to visit this website how to<br>apply visa work visa come to New Zealand<br>okay suppose I open a website how I know<br>that which one is the correct one okay<br>yes left or right wave level is the<br>right one<br>ok sir left the right one ok and who say<br>it oh right oh cool okay okay if I give<br>you more crews which one is why one is<br>the right one okay why you say that why<br>you say the ref is driver you know the<br>address or the ryman why the rival is<br>not no worries man oh but but this party<br>advertisement ever tries to insolent<br>2015 hookah and in cash people or come<br>to New Zealand right especially me if<br>first time I visit this website suppose<br>a tourist while we're interesting oh and<br>then I apply click apply now and then<br>did this website might ask me more<br>personal information such as my first<br>name last name date of birth and blah<br>blah blah right yeah and I give you some<br>of the technical terms here scammers use<br>multiple techniques to get information<br>from the big teams such as they might<br>use us SEO what is SEO search engine<br>optimization ok / tell you when you use<br>google 25 example by this website ok you<br>want to see the real odd imitation<br>insulin website first rain but how if<br>they're scamming use this technical SEO<br>interesting like if that website is the<br>fragrance i shore first and if you don't<br>know the real address of communication<br>in sir how you can protect yourself from<br>people you know<br>deposits range here right yeah or use<br>some advertisement right okay apply visa<br>today you will get work visa now the<br>poster worst okay if scammer use this<br>advertisement and witty spell is great<br>cheap I could save energy now okay all<br>advanced technique whatever you can use<br>from tell you if I'm scabbard and his<br>farming technique farming technique is a<br>technique where i can redirect link or<br>access for 1d to bed website to the fake<br>one yeah I can do that I will not put<br>depth of the details okay let me move to<br>the next example do you like free Wi-Fi<br>or free internet access absolutely most<br>parts like for you things like<br>absolutely no free things in this world<br>like free Wi-Fi or free internet access<br>because when you use free access you<br>need to Sarah Logan you know personal<br>information ok but so if let's say here<br>we have free Wi-Fi how I know what they<br>are cleared for example they might<br>choose open like this and no key lock<br>icon ok I secure the name ok suppose are<br>they are free right by here and then<br>let's say free Wi-Fi and the UC of my<br>cotton ok Oh looks cool and then it says<br>this Wi-Fi hotspot ok let's go yeah I<br>can get the internet access but what<br>happened if this free Wi-Fi shows it<br>where passion ask you to enter your<br>username password on facebook and how to<br>say okay before you use this free Wi-Fi<br>you

get your rear cover they can you<br>do pretend to be you later can massacre<br>at you you seem very dangerous and I<br>could say that last day to make this<br>kind of thing we call Wi-Fi hotspot<br>sorry x prime handy pump is very easy ok<br>you just have a mobile phone base by<br>Moore Batphone sir yeah like this yeah<br>android phone ok I don't do this at home<br>okay you just have mobile phone and then<br>you turn on Wi-Fi hotspot have you ever<br>used that feature cool share Wi-Fi<br>access with others then you if you know<br>some simple programming you just do some<br>program that can capture traffic ok why<br>do next ok I set their Wi-Fi hotspot on<br>the phone say free Wi-Fi at the base ok<br>the best shopping complex right ok free<br>Wi-Fi at the base ok and then a year

use that would you know domain<br>name that is say you adn't ok if they<br>reply by using you and I might I believe<br>I might ok yeah before we both take<br>offense scammers we need to understand<br>how scammers work ok less code is one<br>scam a scammer 11 ok what is sure to be<br>scam ok yeah we're spot us just want you<br>to know how scammers do ok usually scam<br>the one book alone they both as a team t<br>book ok and they try to know the victims<br>as Sharon and I want<br>mentioned okay there the victim usually<br>force their own information there when<br>you throw a commission present<br>information on social media and then the<br>scammer learn about you from your own<br>pause okay and they shake your great<br>deal history witnesses things what you<br>like what you hit OK and befriend with<br>you and Ty to get into your device if<br>possible ok and try to get your secrets<br>for example your sensitive data your<br>password your credit card information or<br>even your you know secret photos ok and<br>when the time is like the scammer will<br>take action ok let me go our pasta ok<br>house cameras know about you ok let me<br>conclude that many ways to do ok but I<br>could say that scammers know you because<br>you provide information to the scammer<br>yeah like you see this example suppose<br>i'm using facebook and deficit Oh today<br>so sad i stay at a formal go there and<br>home alone and that's why this week i<br>will be with my co cream in Bennington<br>and then hm I would at this suppose you<br>can tell you in a dress right home<br>address ok students that if the scammer<br>is a stalker you can now get this guy<br>said home alone and next week she won't<br>be home at home listen he might include<br>my home next week<br>and here you learn me more and more like<br>what I like what I don't like so he can<br>send new scans to me we scary how to<br>protect yourself okay let me conclude<br>but actually a shower on mentioned that<br>underneath this one is the main group<br>yeah is the mask ok technique that we<br>can protect yourself against scammers<br>that is placed your own awareness ok and<br>others awarenesses group others people<br>event ok and also give them knowledge<br>about cyber chess ok you could you know<br>install protection to stop by for<br>example into the lock software and rock<br>they could help you more or less ok but<br>not all the main points that you need to<br>have events ok that's all a 12 ok thank<br>you much follow what I just asked our<br>three speakers to come up and take a<br>seat Andy what's<br>we've got 20 minutes 25 minutes or say<br>six most Christians only we're going to<br>pull it a base so we just actually will<br>eat that a pic please post was quite so<br>I said oh you got any questions the<br>Sunnis games for sharing to do and she<br>noticed that which is over his sights on<br>the dating<br>we made I wasn't speaking to hear that<br>he was active<br>there's a common for the scan map and<br>romance all day thank you thank you for<br>depression yeah let me answer pass thank<br>you okay yes um as I just mentioned<br>scammers usually symbol alone ok so pick<br>up with others they might not work to<br>inequality a right hand same as us so<br>maybe yes in the morning they work they<br>put this common and then they don't say<br>okay are today i will put you and then I<br>passed out this book through my reverb<br>and a different another scammer go to<br>continue the scam okay and if you ask me<br>do we have any like like hot right I<br>mean for it for the providers I could<br>say that some providers hair but most of<br>them do now yes don't have big Hoss<br>about<br>the users of the dating website okay<br>they may I have liquid for example how<br>many users access to you to do all I<br>today and how do you have direction but<br>they might link up all the things for<br>example this guy accessed in in the<br>morning okay and cut this lady and chat<br>with this these messages okay most of<br>the dating recycle reinforced concrete<br>and echo say that the UC app I cotton<br>okay be working on that yeah there you<br>live on providing so for data provenance<br>to record order message is okay and for<br>the user self as well the user can you<br>solve this salt and then the saga can<br>click on the messages and you can poke<br>his clothes and message is important I<br>think I suppose my choppa hero on that<br>day for behavior for the view I<br>these shoes fingers I guess I'm a purse<br>camera on a dating site I can blast but<br>the woman with certain message three or<br>five come back they're only doing it<br>think back to my business is working but<br>also i might could shave them other<br>kinds of additional responses as well so<br>arguably potential victims they could<br>avert with the shape of behavior of<br>would-be scammers especially of roaming<br>scans for example as to what this part<br>is with which buttons will be priests if<br>i say this kind of stuff example i think<br>that would be a risk to consider maybe<br>where the person making my status it was<br>that gives impoverished messages may be<br>the wrong business name starts coming in<br>to you know make kind of thing but I<br>guess it'll be a lot of area to started<br>in 12 I would expect 50 woman is to<br>reply unless they'll stick like a<br>magical be honest you don't mind by<br>scamming photo but a five or six come<br>back there's a pretty good average you<br>business discipline<br>sports too late I know million things I<br>will subsequently the end from others<br>who probably more knowledgeable than I<br>am in the whole area yeah i think that<br>the potential for a person ending i did<br>as a real reality and my nervousness i<br>skipped about three paragraphs of things<br>about how I coped and one of that was<br>learning to be grateful and I was very<br>grateful that I never made made it to my<br>destination because there are stories of<br>woman who have been murdered who have<br>arrived at the destination never made a<br>back home so i guess in terms of<br>consequences there's probably nothing<br>more serious than Ned at the end of the<br>continuum so I think my own knowledge of<br>where things are at currently I think<br>because when someone pointed out to me<br>and I thought it was a very good analogy<br>they talked about the business model of<br>this and they talked about the fact that<br>there is minimal risk and monetary and<br>God needed to be a scammer with the<br>potential of high financial rewards so<br>you know that's an ideal business model<br>to make money so you know it's not going<br>with a I can just answer that increase<br>distance that supportive through it<br>scares means it's increased opportunity<br>for moral disengagement that I might<br>have to see my victim for example they<br>confronted by the carbs three pounds i<br>mentioned doing that was just sex our<br>psychological powers person then I<br>personally don't get mostly applies to<br>scans I can afford some kind of<br>and on top of that to most men of these<br>there's no heart that is the one single<br>country with a vodník club somewhere<br>outside my google so so it's harder to<br>on<br>so someone asked him or whatever so<br>questions<br>what you guys answer is and so one of<br>the places Sharon talked about my recent<br>post was a Microsoft scheme Microsoft<br>somebody accordingly for Microsoft<br>brings you in your home and sees it on<br>for Microsoft community some things on<br>computer so apparently like this what's<br>up skip a few years back it's just<br>conveyed recently in the last two days<br>beautiful services and was when i was<br>when i was reading this article<br>underneath the abyssal it was like a<br>bunch of things that you can hit them we<br>made it happen to them and I looking<br>through them and some of them must like<br>really quite interesting like a lot of<br>people see boy they trying to keep them<br>when the phone is on this day team you<br>know just do like like the more you know<br>make them angry so I thought was what I<br>ve done myself but so there was one<br>thing and especially a few more cleaver<br>their computer science the increasingly<br>you're talking to its kind of quite easy<br>to string them along said it was one<br>thing I mean another thing was it and<br>some people suggested it's really quite<br>be said as they to design a month I<br>think it was school and I forget about<br>cannot dismiss me I'm gonna be freezing<br>my property did a nurse or this other<br>guy he see it um whenever they ring them<br>up he he had some what underway library<br>I was kind of like so that that<br>mistakenly think you know<br>bring out some kind of a little piece<br>and I was thinking I can be quite funny<br>but I don't know maybe that's not kind<br>of a good approach so you answer my<br>and I get a phone and I know it's<br>someone trying to ski me what he should<br>just hang up yes I can hang up<br>hang up georgian guy King up yeah bass<br>baby soon aight Mexico I mean if you<br>just marry any but you get me mad or<br>something for you I can go good eggs<br>well the mid tape will be able to give<br>me some advices because without up to<br>date with the current schemes that are<br>happening you can also report to the<br>police maybe this just friends first<br>sight just enough introduce yourself<br>can I just eat sorry and this is to take<br>nothing away from these things we do do<br>a fabulous job but it would appear that<br>one of the biggest gets here in this<br>country is that there's nobody in a<br>position to actually be doing something<br>proactive so you suspect you may be<br>being scammed is there somewhere you can<br>go with some sort of action can be taken<br>to either lure the skimmer and to expose<br>the skimmer to do those sorts of things<br>to my knowledge that's a big gift and<br>you know I hope over time we do get into<br>a position where people like myself you<br>know other victims of schemes who are<br>prepared to stand up and fight this able<br>to live alongside of the police or<br>alongside of other organizations to<br>actually begin to do some proactive work<br>to stop the schemes before there's some<br>sort of dials the week is being done<br>school meets a again come back to mid<br>safe zone its game at mid skate at neat<br>safe funded to talk to the schools<br>intermediate minister education in<br>anyway<br>people<br>burn<br>the game is for people and some of the<br>and<br>my<br>they're coming up like myself to be I<br>guess what commentary single digits lot<br>I think that Mabel developments be able<br>to catch the young and I bay city<br>rollers or not sure there's always<br>remember to give me to my crackers out<br>the moment I wouldn't ever visit<br>subversion being erotic photo you know<br>and so it's my daughter's it much more<br>digitizer pie and reasonable digital in<br>this environment so I think in the res<br>good point Penguins of thing earlier in<br>the developmental speak to improve your<br>the most of my<br>Annalise<br>research shows also the skin is like<br>you<br>yeah actually yes we have resource that<br>if I could understand our scanners or<br>hackers work what in mind yeah yes yeah<br>but I could say that somehow it's not<br>easy to you know to capture / psychology<br>my pattern be causing major signature of<br>the journey<br>just to add to what Ingrid was saying<br>for I know not long after my arrest the<br>woman used to praise protect the piss<br>outta me for the mere fact that prior to<br>being a reserve I've never heard or knew<br>what a for 19 months for my focus scheme<br>many of the woman I was locked up with<br>particularly those from South Africa had<br>all participated and beam scammers and<br>that was a way of life for many of them<br>so although I've been the victim I do<br>have a level of understanding as to why<br>is<br>good Christian guy just because walking<br>I would still say as a generalization<br>the majority is still very naive and<br>don't fully appreciate and understand<br>what does happen to the inflammation if<br>I can answer that I think the full<br>picture for them Verrett digitalize<br>community list like to seem to unfold<br>and the right about tables probably far<br>of the reach of the research we're not<br>researchers like those very much the<br>snail's pace becoming just as last year<br>on supplemental slaps a hundred billion<br>downloads studio every billion research<br>papers out there to to cover the expense<br>of growth because agree rather than<br>changing our lives<br>the full picture of the Bible seems<br>unreal and the boundaries that seem<br>exactly to equality information because<br>I make quality decisions about cause<br>we're the boundaries of our<br>really<br>just um I know this is a cliche but you<br>know they don't cliche something sounds<br>too good to be true in a probably<br>stay away from<br>and I know that that's really simplistic<br>and it's hard to do when you're probably<br>caught up in it but you know if you know<br>the obvious ones like yeah someone's<br>going to give you a million dollars you<br>you know you think now that's you know<br>pretty obvious that skin but some of the<br>more subtle things but again i would<br>suggest before you get hooked and you<br>know right in there if something doesn't<br>feel right then check it out if you've<br>got a gut feeling something's not right<br>check it out you know there are ways now<br>and i don't know the steam and probably<br>would it have made a difference probably<br>not but people like who you know i can<br>go in behind and actually see is this<br>signature i think you called it or<br>whatever is this pathway you know if<br>this person is telling me they're in<br>london are they in London you know so if<br>there are a multitude of sites out there<br>now about scammers you can actually put<br>people's names in there you can put<br>photos in there and it will show and<br>bring something up you can put email<br>addresses and you can do all of those<br>things and it's a minute it's a cost but<br>it's a minimal cost maybe five or six<br>dollars i think to actually be able to<br>find out if this email address and this<br>person your corresponding from as honest<br>gamers watch list so that would be my<br>recommendation as you have a niggle of<br>any sort then pursue one of those<br>websites put their name and then get<br>yeah ok so we're almost going to say I'm<br>a computer science department here<br>welcome to university we have a research<br>lab research units cyber security<br>researchers of words over the stream as<br>well need researchers and one of the<br>students here has created this website<br>we can do a course now in obscure<br>yourself on different types of schemes<br>that are out there the correct I think<br>so cyber security training is this<br>website rifle range and if you want to<br>have a look at this video we want to<br>learn more contact device from the cyber<br>research cyber security researchers or<br>wipers are very regressive the<br>researchers of waikato gay call cell<br>crow yeah sorry let me promoter ok this<br>is all you can cook Oh crow yeah this is<br>the journey sideways really positions of<br>glycosyl crowed ok if we could just<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
