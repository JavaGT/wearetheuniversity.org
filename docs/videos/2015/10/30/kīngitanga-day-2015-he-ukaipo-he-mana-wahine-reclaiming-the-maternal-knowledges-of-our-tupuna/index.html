always an exciting<br>time for us here at the University and I<br>wanted to talk today well it's about my<br>PhD research but it's also about I've<br>realized post PhD that you actually<br>don't stop thinking about your PhD for<br>quite some time actually after you've<br>finished and and sometimes you're<br>thinking gets wider and sometimes it<br>gets deeper and you realize that the<br>work that you're doing in a PhD is<br>rather momentary actually and so this is<br>a little bit of my PhD well a lot of my<br>PhD but also some thinking about how I<br>might develop on there and what that<br>might look like and so I draw on the<br>concept of quote for and my PhD who<br>quite poor if you break it down into its<br>parts Oh meaning breast high meaning<br>food or to feed in poor meaning night or<br>darkness so a literal translation of the<br>tumors the night feeding other night<br>feeding breasts but the meaning that you<br>get from the likes of hepatica Cooper<br>who suggests that you quite poor is much<br>more than this so firstly you cope was<br>referred to a tomb for mother<br>acknowledging who is the person who<br>provides the night feeding breast and<br>that's life and sustenance to a child<br>but it's not only a reference to one's<br>biological mother and I think this is an<br>important point it also includes<br>those who are involved in raising<br>children whether biologically related or<br>not the second part of a coke war is<br>that it is a tomb that donates a place<br>or space that a person feels a lifelong<br>physical and spiritual connection<br>towards as a geographer a marty<br>geographer who is working in indigenous<br>and modem eternities then the concept of<br>ok Paul kind of says it all for all for<br>me it's about our maternal bodies and<br>it's about opportunities not only as<br>biological mothers but in the wider<br>conceptualization of the tomb and it's<br>about place and very much connected to<br>place as well and so I argue that equip<br>or is one of many concepts an actual<br>fact that serves to demonstrate the<br>sanctity of the maternal body the power<br>and prestige Accord accorded to mothers<br>and mothering and the empowering and<br>collective approach to raising children<br>with until maldi I happen to be blessed<br>with a Papa that connects me to<br>the morrow I or Ahmed I with the name<br>who quite poor so my research kind of<br>sets in a really interesting nexus that<br>I am in the Geography Department so lots<br>of people who think of geography and its<br>traditional kind of high school sense of<br>the tomb kind of wonder how this Co papa<br>foots but as I said we're interested in<br>place and space and I think the quote<br>for does that a lot but interestingly<br>enough my research kind of falls in this<br>quite diverse space around Mardi<br>maturities research which looks at kind<br>of a maturities body of literature and<br>there is a lot of really interesting<br>feminist geographical scholarship and<br>unfortunate to have Robin Longhurst was<br>one of my supervisors it sits within<br>indigenous or wider indigenous<br>scholarship so acknowledging those<br>connections that we have two other<br>indigenous communities in their<br>experiences of maturities as well<br>there's some really interesting material<br>coming out of North America particularly<br>but elsewhere as well it sits within a<br>Copa for Maori and I used a couple Marty<br>and mana Wahine framework and so i mun<br>deeded to all of the wonderful Wahine<br>I like fire Attaway exmouth mama here<br>calc we eat the ethical car and others<br>who have really laid some important<br>foundations for us all for me as a young<br>Maori woman working in this space but I<br>do also have to acknowledge that an<br>actual fact this isn't just an academic<br>exercise but Marty mituna tease has<br>forever and as continued to be lived and<br>practiced by far no habbo in a we in the<br>everyday realities there is a powerful<br>body of literature by scholars and in<br>makati yahoo you Murphy Leone pijo<br>Melinda Smith Daugherty Danny Smith and<br>aloha exmouth to name just a few that<br>demonstrates the decolonizing and<br>transformative potential of our<br>ancestral knowledge 'as specifically<br>marketing our mana Wahine and there are<br>lots of other indigenous woman around<br>the world were actively seeking to<br>decolonize maturities and so ultimately<br>research on Marty maternity Xin wider<br>indigenous maternity has to consider the<br>question of how we provide a decolonized<br>pathway to use Lee only in simpson's<br>words into in through this world for our<br>children and it's that question that's<br>kind of at the heart of of my research I<br>want to acknowledge as well and dr.<br>Kristen gable who we did our PhDs<br>alongside each other and they're very<br>intimately connected who thesis is<br>titled pipe where did the mighty key<br>that you quite poor and we've recently<br>read in a joint chapter together where<br>we bring together our respective work<br>and so some of what I'm talking about<br>here is a joint effort that's not<br>something that I have have done on my<br>own but are now work we argue that it's<br>the stories of our actual Wahine the<br>cosmological stories the stories of our<br>own far no hopper in a way that we can<br>look to to find concepts knowledge as<br>practices and ways of being that serve<br>to decolonize maternity and contemporary<br>art or our ancestral stories speak<br>strongly to the positioning and sanctity<br>of the maternal body in Marty society<br>and they provide a rich and I think much<br>needed an empowering body of knowledge<br>that can transform the ways in which<br>maternal the maternal body maternal work<br>and maturities more generally understood<br>presently and moving into the future for<br>example if we're to look at the<br>popper of maternity from a crop up<br>amaury perspective there are multiple<br>poo taco that speak to the sanctity in<br>power of the maternal body the birth<br>story of papatuanuku from tech Ortiz<br>threw to Paul and enthusiam Adama the<br>pain similar to booth felt by Papa at<br>the restlessness of her children as they<br>lay in darkness between her and Ronnie<br>nuit the creation of henna horny from<br>the clay found a CUDA Waka the stories<br>of henan with the poor who nurtures<br>those who've passed on and the kuraki<br>are used to assist in idea where you<br>were during the birth of her son to Haru<br>Haru all of these stories hold profound<br>knowledge errs messages and practices<br>that can inform and serve in our<br>maternity experiences today these<br>narratives were then our own<br>pop-up attuning to maternity za replete<br>with legacies of resilience the capacity<br>for resistance the unique place of woman<br>and the top o of women's bodies the<br>power of female sexuality the<br>complementary roles of men and women and<br>maternity in the central role of<br>timidity within our Father and<br>communities reclaiming in revisiting the<br>these narratives has incredible<br>potential to decolonize maturities where<br>Wahine inferno can find powerful<br>concepts values and practices that can<br>enable them to make sense of their<br>current realities and project them into<br>the future with confidence as a nema<br>katya points out the logic of<br>Papa tells us that in the final analysis<br>we are our Ottawa and they are us this<br>on its own can radically transform the<br>way in which maternity czar understood<br>and practiced by woman and far know as<br>well as those who are charged with the<br>responsibility for caring for maternal<br>bodies not very easy to see I should at<br>this point point out that I understand<br>the problematics with the concept Marty<br>maturities I acknowledge and I don't<br>necessarily have the time here but there<br>is an incredible diversity and<br>click City embodied within those<br>concepts in actual fact many of the<br>participants I spoke with on my research<br>reinforced this by affirming the tribal<br>huh boo ewee far no variations to<br>various maternity and up upper<br>stories and so it's the story of our<br>ancestors a Norteno a walker and nor<br>nati Kahuna new hooky mahina dong Yi<br>there I wanted to kind of touch on in<br>this part of the presentation so<br>acknowledging the diversities this is<br>one of the potential trails that mahina<br>Ronnie took who was the mother of Roca<br>were the ancestors and this is the just<br>the coin why Rangers kind of crime I<br>Rangers hitting west part of that trail<br>but she she moved from here Tonga from<br>her home and natty Kahuna knew she left<br>here and headed over towards rotya where<br>to dong woo hoo pani was setting up a<br>home for who she left the year when she<br>was quite heavily pregnant and no one<br>really knows quite how far along she was<br>but we know she was pretty well into it<br>because it was at the point when she got<br>to the crime I Rangers and moving<br>through this particular place that she<br>felt the first onset of labor and she<br>gave birth to her okawa and again there<br>are different variations of the story<br>but it said it Finn what I could at the<br>bottom of the crime I Rangers so I'm<br>really blessed to be from this<br>Papa and that my ancestress lift these<br>legacies in these messages in these<br>teachings and these values inscribed and<br>embedded in our landscape so this<br>depicts part of the trail that she took<br>heading towards the banks of the Hmong<br>autonomous stream she was heavily<br>pregnant when she said off in somewhere<br>at the foot hole she gave birth to no<br>kawa the names of a number of these<br>places on this particular map and this<br>is just one segment are significant not<br>just that okawa ewee but Tamar team<br>eternities more generally for example<br>wamu wahini could be translated as the<br>food<br>murmurs of Labor who quite poor mother I<br>was named as such because this is where<br>my hinerangi first fed her newborn baby<br>rukawa the poi poi Tonga which many of<br>you will probably know as te te poi poi<br>Tonga Arakawa as the place where mahatma<br>hinerangi settled roca were using the<br>traditional practice to pui pui to rock<br>or gently sway ones baby in the arms and<br>i'm told by our queer that this was<br>often done in the direction of their<br>homelands to kind of orientate them and<br>settle them down the word kakapo is also<br>seen in the karakia tea to cool henna te<br>where you were rah rah rah rah rah itaku<br>itaku po and it's in reference to the<br>weaving of a ceremony or far turkey or<br>meant that was used in ceremonies of<br>high taboo and was often used as part of<br>the pooty ceremony as well Finn wat i<br>coulda itself is not necessarily<br>discussed in any great detail and<br>existing accounts that i've seen except<br>to say that it refers to the chief<br>Leland because of his weird okawa was<br>born what is missing in these and counts<br>is that coulda has a dual meaning it<br>means treated position in chief but it<br>also means red ochre or two readin so<br>this connection of this to the cuda waka<br>the fertile region of Papa two aku I<br>think are striking and it's my reading<br>of this then that fennel arcada<br>possesses a dual meaning which not only<br>refused to the birth of Roca were a<br>precious Palmer but also to the land<br>that is read and by booth these are my<br>readings of these tombs and I am<br>interested in furthering this research<br>particularly around these eerie and<br>hopparoo specific knowledge errs<br>pertaining to maheen are on his trail<br>and the messages and meanings we can get<br>about maternity from there interestingly<br>enough however these kinds of corded or<br>these words the practices that are<br>embedded in them and not always<br>understood by far no by wahini and<br>particularly by those who are charged<br>contemporarily with caring for maternal<br>bodies and mother<br>Inferno so why is it it's difficult to<br>go past this beast of colonialism but<br>colonialism has undoubtedly transformed<br>Marty mituna tease they have been and<br>will likely continue to be attempts to<br>fragment our papa as Marty woman<br>and to distort our pudica nearly all of<br>our cosmological accounts have been<br>subject to colonial retellings and those<br>retellings marginalized the role of<br>wahini and they distort the power and<br>taboo of the maternal body further the<br>reconstruction of Marty maternity Xin to<br>what has been perceived to be an ideal<br>European model of pregnancy booths and<br>mothering began at the earliest point of<br>European contact the state failed and<br>often continues to fail to recognize<br>existing systems of maturities already<br>in place and working well within marty<br>society and subsequently launched a<br>conference comprehensive attack on my<br>team eternities the effects of which are<br>still being felt by woman in there far<br>no today and so it was the retelling of<br>our stories the marginalization of our<br>lil the marginalization of our spiritual<br>knowledge ease and practices the<br>fragmentation of the collective endless<br>legislated assimilation they're all kind<br>of worked to colonize and transform the<br>ways in which we are pregnant the ways<br>we become pregnant why not that the ways<br>in which we become pregnant the unions<br>that we have our understandings of what<br>it means to be a family where we booth<br>how we booth and then how we mother and<br>and my research it was increasingly<br>obvious the ways in which colonialism<br>has lived and living in the spaces of<br>maternity and so not only do women<br>experience colonialism through<br>institution and institutional norms and<br>hospitals tended to be those spaces that<br>had the biggest impact on woman's<br>maternal bodies but it also manifests<br>and Wanda Jackson says are the little<br>every day colonization which manifest<br>wherever you too<br>hidden in participants spoke of this<br>particularly in the space of the<br>hospital as a look a steer a comment a<br>roll of the eyes making them feel both<br>invisible and hyper visible at the same<br>time one of the practices or the most<br>evidence practice that has run the gamut<br>of colonization or colonialism and is<br>now being practiced and reclaimed and<br>reinvented by women and far no as the<br>practice of returning the placenta to<br>the youth Yahoo Keith effin way Keith FN<br>what the word phenol and Maori meaning<br>both land and placenta it doesn't take<br>too much to see the significance of<br>burying the placenta at a place of<br>significance historically this was on<br>your tribal lands at your ancestral home<br>or sometimes at a boundary marker that<br>marked the significance or the<br>relationship between the parents or<br>between you and her boo quite literally<br>thus practice connects babies in their<br>final to their ok Paul and this has been<br>taken up by many families by reclaiming<br>the practice of returning the placenta<br>to the youth for many far know however<br>this isn't a straightforward process and<br>reclaiming these kinds of practices mean<br>that they begin to reweave new ways of<br>initiating this practice far no perform<br>this particular ticking and diverse and<br>evolving ways changing to meet the<br>contemporary realities and needs afar<br>know the where and when and how the<br>phenol is being buried as changing<br>furthermore the use of a poufy Noah is<br>being revitalized in new and creative<br>ways if we finish our other containers<br>to hold the placenta before you put them<br>back in the earth and so you just see a<br>couple here that participants shared<br>through the through the research as<br>families negotiate and recreate a sense<br>of place that may have otherwise been<br>disconnected from the ancestral places<br>they are remaking and performing this<br>the significance of this practice wasn't<br>lost on one inferno I spoke to and I<br>love this image from one of my<br>participants one of the woman and the<br>research she gave it to me so this is<br>your standard new moms essentials list<br>those new mothers or new parents and you<br>get these lists given to you and you go<br>through and tech and make sure and<br>they're usually for people who are going<br>into a hospital or to a birthing center<br>so it's the list of things you should<br>pick and take and this way honey I'm not<br>sure if you can see in the extras has<br>explicitly written a poofy Noah as a<br>essential for her new mum essential list<br>for taking to the hospital and so I just<br>thought that was a really powerful<br>example about how significant this was<br>helpful that's why he need any far no I<br>was also interested to see an April the<br>white bottle dhb providing a poofy no<br>I'm making packs are two new mothers or<br>two mothers who all families who are<br>about to have babies as well and more<br>recently you may have seen on the news<br>the Oaxaca de and it's the research<br>that's saying that these were have could<br>are reducing the number of sudden infant<br>death in Alterra New Zealand as well<br>these are significant milestones because<br>only a short time ago relatively<br>speaking woman were not allowed to take<br>the placenta from the hospital or<br>maternity unit in fact I ask you to<br>consider whether or not your own<br>placenta was buried or taken home or<br>what happened to it my parents and my<br>own fin wha and i would suggest for many<br>of us were either incinerated or dumped<br>the refusal to return the Fen wat so far<br>know when woman moved into hospitals as<br>perhaps one of the most visceral attacks<br>on Marty maternity and this continued<br>until approximately the mid to late<br>1980s and then hospital policy shifted<br>and now it's relatively normal although<br>not entirely for this to be the phenyl<br>to be made available this is a powerful<br>example though to show and this is from<br>one of the midwives I spoke to who was<br>training at during a period and the<br>seven<br>these when it was the norm for these<br>Finnerty be incinerated or to be put in<br>the rubbish and she was training and she<br>said I knew when I was 16 or 17 training<br>to be a nurse that it was wrong to put<br>them in the munching machines I couldn't<br>do it I used to hide them I used to go<br>to unbelievable lengths to sneak them<br>and brown paper bags wrap them and my<br>coat and then I'd find somewhere to bury<br>it part of my role was to be quite yucky<br>over the fennel and it's how many phenyl<br>have gone back to Papa to Enugu and it's<br>a hundred percent that's what makes me<br>proud of my mahi and so she put herself<br>at professional risk at it she put<br>herself in a position that meant she was<br>at risk in a whole range of different<br>ways not to not to mention the issues<br>around weight or for who and managing<br>other people's fin or and having to deal<br>with deal with them as well there are<br>many other moments of resistance some<br>that are explicit and others more subtle<br>non-participation and antenatal care and<br>postnatal care the unheard and unseen<br>performances of ritual and ceremony<br>during pregnancy labor and Booth the<br>naming of our children the languages we<br>speak to our children the song sung<br>incantations perform two babies both<br>inside and outside of the womb and as<br>Kirsten gable points out on her thesis<br>mothering in and of itself is a<br>political act and it's a way to<br>participate in the sustainability of<br>ourselves and our communities while the<br>particular practice of the return of the<br>Fen waka fifa NOAA has seen a resurgence<br>I should point out that for many of the<br>wine and finally spoke to many other<br>tikona and Maori ways of being pregnant<br>and birthing babies more broadly<br>continues to exist on the periphery with<br>regards to dominant constructions of<br>birth and i'll tell you a new zealand<br>and there exists what a Chamorro woman<br>in guam says a placental politics that<br>still exists in our Tarawa new zealand<br>decolonizing maternity 'he's the in<br>means transforming the spatial politics<br>the placental politics and pregnancy &amp;<br>parenting politics across all spaces<br>both physical and discursive<br>here in Alterra New Zealand and I think<br>this midwife's quote kind of sums up why<br>we need to consider the spatial politics<br>of booth as well I'll end then by coming<br>back to the positive and I think it's<br>important to remember that it's not just<br>the material exhibitions of takano that<br>are important they are important but we<br>must also look for and acknowledge those<br>values that can inform and transform<br>opportunity experiences reclaiming the<br>collective approach to raising children<br>as affirmed in the concept of Hope or as<br>one such value that we can draw from to<br>transform eternity experiences for women<br>and far no traditionally raising a child<br>was a robust system that ensured the<br>well-being of both mother and child and<br>ultimately the wider finer and community<br>this is reflected in concepts such as<br>the Pajaro kiki and in order to reclaim<br>the full meaning of to cope or we must<br>also reclaim the collectivism of Maori<br>communities in raising children we must<br>decolonize Western patriarchal and<br>heteronormative conceptualizations of<br>family which served to isolate Marty<br>mothers from traditional networks of<br>support as commander son who's a First<br>Nations scholar highlights if we fail to<br>do so we run the risk of heaping more<br>responsibility on already overburdened<br>mothers we must question the logic of<br>asking mothers to carry the nation's we<br>must ask ourselves where are the men<br>where are the communities where is the<br>nation and where is the state and not to<br>forget where are the children the<br>entanglement of mana Wahine tamanna far<br>no to mana habu tu mano e we opens up i<br>think fertile possibilities excuse the<br>pun for research that engages with habbo<br>and eerie specificities around maternity<br>in her decision to travel a great<br>distance so far into her pregnancy and<br>therefore birth his son and the Como<br>region mahina dong Yi dis demonstrated<br>great strength mana and foresight<br>securing lens for her descendants<br>rereading this story from a co-op ahmadi<br>perspective has a potential
