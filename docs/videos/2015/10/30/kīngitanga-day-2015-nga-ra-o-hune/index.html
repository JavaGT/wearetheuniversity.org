be<br>conscripted we wake up the monopolies<br>the only one so like him I asked the<br>question why only us and in the spirit<br>of this King eating a day my assertion<br>Monty is because of the kingdom<br>it has to be it has to be these this is<br>the heart of the kingdom so how do you<br>break a heart you take away the most<br>precious about that heart and of course<br>they already took the

Asian<br>81 August of 1881 he called away with<br>the government the crowd representatives<br>and he asked them to come to Pyongyang<br>Alexandra at that time was the name of<br>the JumpShip and there

declared King<br>Kurata was in England considerably<br>cousin / Meredith as that sub<br>considerable research on that as well<br>and he was apparently fated in ET ed and<br>looked after world by those people in<br>England so that when war was declared<br>Kurata the Maori King had just completed<br>an audience with King George and Queen<br>Mary nobody's recorded what was said in<br>that audience but

what if I'm not eliminating the data<br>so I've started but to be hard of us<br>just to share here ministry<br>a lot of [ __ ]<br>so that these things these stories is<br>let's<br>I<br>noreda tena koutou I invited a number of<br>the people in the who are the<br>descendants of those conscripts were<br>very fortunate that Tara Tara ha nui mum<br>who is able to be here with with us this<br>morning they're not with Delhi me I did<br>video I would introduce her Shia she is<br>and asked her a simple question and that<br>simple question is what legacy do you<br>think your father sorry your grandfather<br>left for you and for us so invite tell<br>first of all it's a privilege to be a<br>um<br>the legacy that I think my grandfather<br>left there's the<br>what I've learned from him with wildly<br>from this journey is them the strength<br>to stand up thank you for what you<br>believe in when I learned about how he<br>refused to fight and the reason why<br>because of Chicano because because of<br>what King toffee Albert said years prior<br>to me that's to me he's a hero to go<br>against the grain to go against what<br>it it's a privilege to know that that it<br>was my grandfather that did that he's my<br>grandfather I can say that I'm a<br>grandchild of a hero along with took her<br>and those others did their grandchildren<br>and being able to listen to my mother<br>she doesn't that's quite shy she's very<br>quite reserved so it was an honor to<br>have much long time coming and sit with<br>her and draw out the corridor she<br>doesn't she won't talk unless you ask<br>the specific questions don't ask the<br>question you waked the answer that's<br>that's the old school they said that's<br>how they are so it was a huge honor to<br>be a part of that and just said just a<br>especially for my mom it was a<br>really emotional emotional journey for<br>who brought back a lot of memories that<br>but looking at my mother too<br>because she stands for the same sancti<br>gunner she fights for the same thing and<br>so<br>she's 22 quintana<br>always has been always will be and<br>there's something that that we're left<br>with myself for my siblings our children<br>and I think it's something that we're<br>going to be able to to share I think the<br>world should hear about this and we are<br>you just found out about it and he's my<br>grandfather we only found out when we<br>but you that's the legacy I think my 5<br>tortola in 1995 with the settlement of<br>the road parking queen elizabeth the<br>second and this is the only sign that<br>it's colonizing power as the ruler of a<br>colonizing power has apologized to a<br>colonized people and she signed the<br>apology with her in hand so much of the<br>hood 20 years later now has passed them<br>so the telling of the story still has<br>that turns off and you sit there you<br>just feel the team but that tingle is<br>not any longer so much in the heads<br>office it's more yes and so let's<br>celebrate the hills let's celebrate that<br>ability to stand strong in the face of<br>fierce fiercest opposition so that<br>apology has been extended<br>and it was gratefully received a tune on<br>take one and maybe Monty long<br>on the number playa<br>for different reasons lately religious<br>any body betrayed<br>another strength taken too many training<br>they're not worried about<br>ah<br>just<br>just for the time time is getting on but<br>at the present time the students from<br>Oklahoma conch have taken a petition for<br>day of commemoration of those warm and<br>the lives lost here on our own Beck Beck<br>toys Monty said earlier and his speech<br>so we're continuing to concert eyes the<br>broader New Zealand public about what<br>happened on our own bedroom so many<br>don't know this and if i can just<br>support that'll ha nui and saying it<br>would be great if from this queen you<br>went back to your own so do you know<br>about the petition have you signed the<br>petition do you know about what happened<br>here in the wake up but not just in the<br>wake of door actually right across the<br>lane where other people and the eighteen<br>hundreds were affected by this action<br>illegal war and then later invited<br>to come and fight any other piston to<br>the world confounds the logic and the<br>wine so this day of commemoration we<br>would say is very important in making<br>this country and the world aware that<br>what happened right here in this length<br>and as Tom for kaya said earlier not<br>just men affected by this but old people<br>women and children were killed his worth<br>you might hear about what's happening in<br>Bosnia and as Monty seed over in Iraq<br>and over that those places far away<br>today but not many people know that<br>there<br>right here in this space and we should<br>not because we are unhappy about we are<br>unhappy about but it is part of our<br>history so I think what do you give<br>government for that brilliant inspiring<br>opening to our day and hope that your<br>viewing of this and your participation<br>and this part of our day is an addition<br>and I pilot Charlie can
