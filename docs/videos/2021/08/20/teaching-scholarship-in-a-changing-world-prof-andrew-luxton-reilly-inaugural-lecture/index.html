This change in the perceived value of computing has coincided with rapid changes in the computing discipline, and rapid changes in education practices due to computing technology. Teaching in this dynamic environment is challenging. A scholarly approach to teaching and learning helps make sense of the complexity of education in a changing discipline using changing pedagogies. In this talk I discuss my own journey through computing education and reflect on teaching scholarship in a changing world.<br><br>Andrew Luxton-Reilly is a computing education researcher who focuses on introductory programming education and collaborative learning tools and techniques. He began at the University of Auckland as an undergraduate studying a BA then MA (Hons) in Philosophy, before joining the Computer Science department in a teaching role in 1995. He continued in a teaching role until 2012 when he completed a PhD in Computing Education. Andrew has chaired several international conferences, holds a position as an executive board member of the ACM Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education, and is the Associate Dean (Teaching and Learning) in the Faculty of Science.<br><br>For more videos from the University of Auckland, visit our YouTube brand channel: https://www.youtube.com/UNIofAUCKLAND</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

of<br>science here at the university of<br>auckland it's my very great pleasure to<br>welcome you to the inaugural lecture of<br>professor andrew luxton riley<br>andrew works in the area of computer<br>science education<br>he took a somewhat unconventional route<br>to this area starting with the ba and<br>then in ma in philosophy here at<br>auckland continuing with a bsc in<br>computer science then a later later a pg<br>dip in academic practice and a phd in<br>computer science he likes to accumulate<br>degrees<br>along the way he was engaged in a mainly<br>teaching role in the department of<br>computer science before transitioning to<br>a senior lectureship and beyond<br>andrew is an excellent educator as might<br>be expected for someone<br>who has faculty university and national<br>teaching excellence awards<br>his teaching has primarily focused on<br>very large first year computer science<br>classes<br>stage one computer science here enrolls<br>close to four thousand course enrolments<br>hence so vital it's vital to the<br>health of the faculty and the university<br>andrea has been the principal curriculum<br>driver and teaching innovator for these<br>courses for over two decades<br>andrew's computer science education<br>research uses social science research<br>methods to understand what makes for<br>effective pedagogy in an intensely<br>technical subject<br>andrew has rapidly developed a formal<br>formidable corpus of publications and<br>tools as well as a strong international<br>recognition for his work<br>he's chaired several international<br>conferences holds a position as an<br>executive board member of the acm<br>special interest group in computer<br>science education<br>now seven conference and two<br>longitudinal impact awards along with a<br>strong citation record<br>andrew is now also influencing teaching<br>in the broader faculty and university<br>via his role as the associate dean<br>teaching and learning<br>to go alongside a short but highly<br>eventful stint as associate dean<br>academic just as covert struck last year<br>andrew's an all-round academic but with<br>a passion for education<br>please join me in welcoming professor<br>thank you john for those very kind words<br>and i will thank you again<br>in the middle of my presentation where<br>so today's talk is really split into<br>three parts and the first part is a<br>reflection of my own experiences through<br>this journey in computing education and<br>it gives you some idea about the lens<br>through which i view the world<br>the second is<br>talking about computer science as a<br>discipline and how that's changed and<br>then finally talking about teaching<br>scholarship<br>and the value that it provides<br>and i need to start by thanking my<br>parents who have managed to make it here<br>today for this presentation<br>everything i have achieved can be<br>credited to their belief in me and their<br>unwavering support throughout my entire<br>life so thanks mum and dad<br>now they say that parents are teachers<br>too<br>and in my case that is literally true<br>because my father was initially trained<br>as a boat builder and then after the<br>apprenticeship was finished changed to<br>training as a teacher and became a<br>woodwork teacher<br>his first position was then at waiheke<br>island<br>he loved that that was originally<br>just a single year i believe<br>as rural service and loved it so much he<br>stayed there and this house here with<br>the little red mark<br>i was born in 1971<br>and<br>grew up on waiheke in a family of three<br>boys<br>and i'm the middle one on the right hand<br>being a boat builder<br>my father built several boats which we<br>use to<br>cruise through the hauraki golf so i<br>spent my childhood years almost every<br>holiday<br>at a different beach somewhere in the<br>hauraki<br>and while it was a wonderful experience<br>it gave me a very twisted view of<br>crowded beaches<br>one of the other benefits of having a<br>parent as a teacher<br>is that we could borrow the school<br>computer<br>so around 1980 the school had invested<br>in an apple ii computer<br>there was only one<br>in the school and occasionally on<br>weekends when it wasn't being used by<br>another teacher we got to take it home<br>and i got to play computer games<br>and at that time that was a real rarity<br>because there weren't easy access to<br>a couple of years later the school<br>invested in a laboratory of these<br>computers and the ones they chose were<br>these commodore 64 computers<br>and as part of that bulk buy my parents<br>decided to buy one of these so this was<br>my first computer that i really had<br>access to<br>now it came with three games<br>and i got really good at those three<br>games<br>but<br>it wasn't long before i got tired of<br>that and i wanted more<br>and this book here<br>is the one that i purchased<br>because that had 60 games for the<br>commodore 64.<br>now unfortunately<br>coming from a book<br>you had to type them in<br>so this is my first experience<br>programming i didn't have a book to<br>teach me how to program i just typed all<br>of these in and hoped after several<br>pages of such typing<br>that it<br>worked as you may know computers are<br>very precise so a single character out<br>of place means your program didn't work<br>so i got to learn early techniques of<br>debugging<br>and<br>persistence<br>as i grew older<br>i retained that interest in computing<br>and<br>at this stage<br>there was no real computing careers that<br>were advertised it was early in the<br>stages of computers being used in<br>businesses<br>um<br>there were a few personal computers but<br>most of them most people didn't have<br>them<br>and so i didn't see a computer science<br>degree as an option and so i thought i<br>would be an electrical engineer because<br>they sounded like the kind of people<br>that might have something to do with<br>computers i didn't know any electrical<br>engineers i didn't know anybody in this<br>field but<br>that seemed like a sensible thing<br>now unfortunately<br>waiheke<br>was quite a rural school there's about<br>300 350<br>people at the entire school<br>it was quite casual some of the teachers<br>would ask you to use their first names<br>and so we would refer to helen or bill<br>and unfortunately they didn't have the<br>last year of high school so year 13 or<br>seventh form<br>wasn't an option because the school<br>simply wasn't big enough so i decided i<br>and i ended up at auckland boys grammar<br>and this was a significant culture shock<br>you did not refer to the teachers by<br>i remember in the mathematics class at<br>the start of every term they would give<br>us a maths test and based on the<br>performance in that test they would<br>allocate seating where the top student<br>in the class was in the<br>right hand corner and as you worked<br>backwards you knew how you ranked with<br>respect to others in the class in each<br>term<br>you would set another test and people<br>would shuffle in their rankings so if<br>you moved three to the left that was a<br>a lot of these students were really<br>driven really focused they knew exactly<br>where they wanted to go<br>medicine<br>law<br>engineering in some cases physics or<br>other degrees<br>and i had an epiphany throughout this<br>process<br>that i didn't know<br>what i wanted to do and i wasn't really<br>willing to commit<br>to this degree in electrical engineering<br>because i didn't really know anything<br>about this pathway<br>so<br>when i finished my seventh form i came<br>to university and i deliberately chose a<br>range of subjects that i had never<br>experienced before i chose a ba<br>bachelor of arts and i studied<br>philosophy psychology ancient history<br>and mathematics because i still quite<br>as i quite like graphs and things shows<br>where i started<br>this is the average grade across all of<br>the subjects and i will say<br>but my father asked me what are you<br>going to do for a career and i think he<br>asked me that every time i went back to<br>visit<br>and so i thought i should keep my career<br>options open and in my second year i<br>picked up a bsc in computer science and<br>kind of split the subject so i did a ba<br>philosophy psychology bsc computer<br>however<br>things don't always go as planned<br>and<br>i discovered a social side of university<br>that didn't always gel with<br>what this did is give me a real<br>appreciation that your grades are not<br>necessarily a predictor of where you're<br>going to be in the future<br>if you'd looked at<br>my record after three years<br>i don't think any academic would have<br>pointed at that record and say that's<br>professor material<br>to give you some idea of just how bad a<br>student i was<br>i was enrolled in a philosophy of<br>science course which i really enjoyed<br>but<br>it was from 4 till 6 pm<br>on a wednesday and at that stage they<br>had whole year-long courses<br>and so the winter term<br>now i didn't always get to the class and<br>i'd missed a few at the start of the<br>year they'd given us a course<br>information sheet that said there was a<br>mid-semester test<br>but the date hadn't been announced at<br>that stage and so i thought<br>this mid-semester test must be coming up<br>soon i should go to the class to find<br>out about it and so i went to the class<br>and i sat down and it was quite busy<br>there were a lot of students there and i<br>waited and then some tutors arrived and<br>started handing out some blank lined<br>refill<br>and i got that sinking feeling as you do<br>when you suddenly realize today<br>is the test<br>and so<br>i thought well there's nothing i can do<br>at this point and so i waited for the<br>lecturer to announce what the question<br>was and put it up on the overhead slide<br>or write it on the blackboard<br>and after a few minutes he said<br>you may start writing and everybody<br>started writing<br>and i suddenly realized<br>they must have given the question out<br>the week before<br>and everybody had prepared an answer<br>and i didn't know what the question was<br>and in the silence of<br>an exam i was too embarrassed to put my<br>hand up and say excuse me what's the<br>question and so i just wrote everything<br>i knew<br>about the philosophy of science<br>and to this day i do not know what that<br>question was<br>i do know when i got my script back i've<br>never seen so much red pen<br>and a lot of those paragraphs had off<br>topic<br>now<br>i'm sure that doesn't happen<br>to many students<br>particularly now that they have<br>so i did eventually graduate with my ba<br>and<br>continued to do a bsc<br>and finished up most of that you can see<br>it's a bit rocky<br>but<br>at some stage<br>i finished<br>the ba degree and i had most of the<br>papers i needed for my bsc and so i<br>applied for a couple of jobs and i<br>didn't get any of them<br>and the path of least resistance was to<br>just stay at university so i enrolled in<br>an m.a<br>and what i discovered was that<br>at masters level you don't have to<br>memorize nearly as much and that worked<br>well for me<br>so my masters i found easier than many<br>at this stage<br>my student allowances had run out i was<br>having to work<br>to support myself and laboring at that<br>point was sort of eight dollars or ten<br>dollars an hour it wasn't a very<br>good income<br>but<br>working in the computer science<br>laboratory paid 15 an hour<br>and so that was already on campus i<br>didn't have to travel that made it<br>extremely attractive as an option for me<br>so i signed up for as much laboratory<br>demonstrating as i could<br>and<br>in 1994 that helped fund my way through<br>my master's and then at the end of that<br>year i saw a job advertising a year-long<br>position<br>tutoring in first year computer science<br>courses<br>and so that was even more attractive<br>because i'd get paid for 20 hours a week<br>and the pay rate was more like 20 an<br>hour<br>so i was in on that<br>and jennifer lennon here<br>interviewed me and offered me the<br>position because i i think i had a<br>philosophy background and could<br>communicate relatively effectively so<br>she must have seen beyond the grades<br>during this first year john hamer and<br>jennifer lennon were teaching the<br>particular course that i was involved in<br>tutoring and john asked all of the<br>tutors if they would deliver a week's<br>worth of lectures<br>i suspect it may have been the<br>way of reducing his workload but<br>in any case<br>i had to move from a small<br>group<br>tutoring classes of maybe<br>15 or 20 people<br>into<br>this lecture theater so i gave my first<br>set of three lectures in this course<br>in this lecture theater right here<br>to an audience<br>similar<br>now that i think about it i haven't seen<br>so many people in this room for many<br>years<br>now that was a terrifying experience and<br>if you haven't ever given a lecture to a<br>wide audience of people in a theater<br>like this<br>it's scary<br>and i never wanted to do it i was a shy<br>kid i could cope with small groups of<br>people but delivering a lecture to a<br>large audience was terrifying<br>but i got over it<br>because i had to<br>if somebody had said<br>do you want to give lectures<br>i would have said no<br>but i wasn't given that choice<br>so i finished my<br>master's degree in philosophy<br>and again i looked around at other jobs<br>i had to do something the contract for a<br>half-time position wasn't really what i<br>wanted to do forever you can't live on a<br>half-time salary<br>and<br>i did get another offer being technical<br>staff working for the school of<br>architecture actually<br>but i really like teaching and so i<br>negotiated with the head of department<br>at that time bob duran<br>and<br>i thought i was negotiating really<br>he<br>probably<br>just<br>thought yeah whatever and and gave me<br>the job because this was a time of<br>growth in computer science<br>it was growing rapidly and so there were<br>during this time i also met<br>emma riley<br>and we started dating in 1996 this is us<br>heading off to an art history tour of<br>europe<br>um<br>she studied art history and so we went<br>so for the next<br>five or so years<br>i was employed on one year rolling<br>contracts as a tutor and so i gave<br>lectures gave<br>small tutorials<br>and<br>eventually<br>that one-year contract changed to a<br>three-year contract as a senior tutor<br>and after eight years it was turned into<br>a permanent role<br>and over this time<br>i discovered that there is no training<br>at all<br>for teachers<br>as academics we spend five or six years<br>being trained as researchers<br>people typically have a close<br>relationship with their supervisor i<br>meet weekly with my phd students so by<br>the time they graduate there's been 150<br>hours of one-on-one intense mentoring<br>for my<br>teaching<br>mentoring<br>the previous person teaching said<br>look at the entry in the calendar which<br>is one paragraph long that covers the<br>topics and if you look at last year's<br>exam that'll give you a pretty good idea<br>what you need to cover<br>that was it<br>i was evaluated by somebody that walked<br>past and said to me afterwards i could<br>now there was a division at the<br>university the center for professional<br>development and then later the center<br>for academic development which later<br>became clear<br>and now is disestablished they made<br>a lot of<br>great courses and i went on 20 or 30 of<br>those workshops and really spent the<br>time<br>learning to be a teacher and so really<br>that teaching only time was a gift<br>because i had no other distractions i<br>didn't have the pressures of publication<br>i could just refine my teaching i got to<br>experiment reflect develop the expertise<br>that i needed<br>now there were a couple of<br>situations at one time<br>i used to teach right after lunch it was<br>in that sort of one till two o'clock<br>slot and the lights would go down when<br>we played the overhead projector so that<br>you could easily see the screen they<br>weren't bright like these ones<br>and so after lunch in a warm lecture<br>theater with low light<br>occasionally<br>people would fall asleep and i had to<br>actually ask a student to wake somebody<br>up because their snoring was<br>figuring out what to do when you've got<br>a whole lot of overhead transparencies<br>and you walk in to give a lecture and<br>the overhead projector is gone<br>or the bulb has blown and there's no<br>backup<br>you know you<br>now at this point i need to introduce a<br>couple of other figures in the story of<br>my career and that's ivan reilly and<br>barbara miller riley these are the<br>parents of emma<br>and<br>although i didn't know at the time<br>ivan<br>was the director of the school of<br>mathematical and information sciences<br>when i was employed there was a school<br>structure computer science statistics<br>and mathematics were under that umbrella<br>and ivan was the director of that school<br>and so technically i was dating the<br>boss's daughter<br>and so i've got to tick that box in the<br>ivan was also<br>instrumental in setting up the maths<br>education unit and barbara was<br>doing her phd in maths education and so<br>both heavily interested in education<br>disciplinary based education research<br>and they asked me because i was so<br>passionate about teaching<br>why don't you consider research in<br>computing education<br>and i'd never considered it as a real<br>option before then and so thank you<br>barbara and ivan for putting me on this<br>track<br>and so<br>i asked john that's a slightly younger<br>john<br>who was the head of department at the<br>time<br>if i could go to this overseas<br>conference i was a senior tutor i had no<br>publications there this was purely a<br>jaunt to go and experience the world<br>and i wanted to go to the<br>sigsi technical symposium that's a<br>special interest group in computer<br>science education their technical<br>symposium<br>2003 was their 34th conference so this<br>had been running for many many years<br>and<br>john<br>in his wisdom thanks john<br>decided to<br>support me to go to this conference<br>and experience<br>this was reno nevada<br>which<br>i discovered was the least interesting<br>city in the<br>world<br>but the conference itself was wonderful<br>because it changed my life i discovered<br>a community of people and quite a large<br>international community of people who<br>loved computing education<br>this is what they did and so it<br>validated the idea that i could do this<br>and so this led to phase two moving from<br>teaching only to teaching scholarship<br>and i was a senior tutor<br>and i started to develop research skills<br>by interacting with other people that<br>were starting to do research so i<br>collaborated with a couple of people in<br>the department<br>and managed to publish a few research<br>papers<br>during this time<br>i did some work at aut with people there<br>so tony and allison and jackie who's<br>over there<br>fantastic to have such experienced<br>people in education research just over<br>in this time<br>i got married 2004<br>so that's my first day as a luxtan riley<br>and as fate would have it i hadn't<br>published anything<br>under the name luxton and so all my<br>publications are under one married name<br>and that makes things a lot simpler<br>particularly because this is a quite an<br>unusual combination of names and there<br>are no other lux and riley's in the<br>world<br>makes it really easy to locate and<br>provide evidence for my impact<br>edify<br>2005. so this is the first time i<br>traveled and presented at an<br>international conference this is the<br>10th annual 60 conference on innovation<br>and technology in computer science<br>education and this became my favorite<br>conference<br>one because it was always in europe in<br>interesting places<br>and two<br>because they run these things called<br>working groups<br>this is not from 2006 but my first<br>working group was in 2006<br>in bologna<br>and the working group concept is<br>brilliant<br>what happens with conferences is that<br>you send your publications in they get<br>peer reviewed and then the successful<br>conferences<br>successful papers get published and you<br>go to present them<br>but working groups at the time you<br>submit your papers you submit a proposal<br>to do some research and that gets<br>reviewed and if they think it's viable<br>then they put that up on the website and<br>researchers who are going to the<br>conference can apply to join this<br>working group<br>and you send in your cv and if they<br>accept you then you get to be part of<br>that working group and so you start<br>working on a research paper<br>research idea and you exchange emails<br>and communicate these days with zoom<br>and then you go to the conference for<br>two days before the conference you sit<br>in a room like this working with eight<br>to ten other people from around the<br>world<br>on this research problem and then<br>throughout the conference you have<br>access to this room with the idea of<br>producing a draft by the end of that<br>five day period and those drafts are<br>usually 20 pages of research really<br>solid bringing together<br>people with expertise from around the<br>world<br>and what this does is give unprecedented<br>access to senior researchers in the area<br>and to provide mentorship and networking<br>to junior staff members<br>and so i knew nobody going to my first<br>working group and at the end of it i'd<br>worked with 10<br>expert researchers<br>for five intense days<br>it's not like meeting somebody over<br>lunch you have a chat maybe you remember<br>them again if you've been in a room for<br>five days you know that person<br>i've now been to a lot of these working<br>groups<br>and they have been absolutely<br>instrumental in lifting my profile<br>internationally connecting me with<br>people in the community<br>and creating the the career that i've<br>had<br>nearing the end of this phase luca my<br>oldest child was born in<br>phase three<br>is moving into phd research so local was<br>born 2007 in february and i spent the<br>next year doing that postgraduate<br>certificate in academic practice<br>and working on at the end of that when i<br>finished that certificate i enrolled in<br>my phd and worked on that for the rest<br>of 2008 9 10 and 11.<br>devin<br>my second child was born<br>at the start of<br>2011 in february and i submitted in<br>december<br>so throughout this time i was<br>working full-time<br>and<br>managed to produce 25 research papers<br>i don't remember much of the detail<br>it was a it was a hard time<br>so this is devon<br>born in 2011<br>and at the end of that i got my phd in<br>2012.<br>and i have to absolutely credit<br>beryl plymouth<br>as my main supervisor throughout this<br>time who really taught me how to<br>supervise students and how to run a<br>research group<br>so<br>robert sheehan was the secondary<br>supervisor and john heimer's there at<br>the side because<br>initially i enrolled<br>with john hamer being my supervisor but<br>he left<br>abandoned me<br>and so i got a new supervisor i do<br>remember beryl looking at my lit review<br>and the first thing she said to me was<br>that's really good writing<br>you now need to start again<br>so in 2012<br>finished my phd i transferred from<br>senior tutor to senior lecturer thanks<br>to jill dobby who was the head of<br>department at the time<br>and<br>through the next five years or so<br>i developed a computing education course<br>which is one of the few in the world<br>computing education is still not<br>stupidly widespread but it is growing<br>developed my skills as a supervisor and<br>during this time zoe was born that's my<br>third child 2014.<br>she's making an early start learning<br>and so then the the last second to last<br>phase moving into academic leadership<br>program leader head of school deputy<br>head of school academic associate dean<br>academics briefly<br>associate dean teaching and learning<br>covert<br>executive board of sigsi and<br>international conferences<br>and throughout all of this<br>i have worked with a lot of different<br>people and so these are just the people<br>within the university of auckland that<br>i've co-authored papers with<br>a number of fantastic colleagues<br>and paul denny is so large here because<br>i published 45 papers with paul it's<br>probably<br>roughly a third of my total so<br>absolutely fantastic colleague<br>he unfortunately is not here today<br>this<br>and then that's it that's as far as my<br>okay so moving into the second part of<br>the talk just thinking a little bit<br>about computer science which is the<br>discipline that i'm embedded in<br>computing in the 40s of course looked<br>like this these computers were<br>extraordinarily expensive very large<br>very few people had them<br>and the association for computing<br>machinery<br>which is<br>where sigsi is part of<br>was founded in 1947 very very early to<br>help manage these computers<br>but computers were so expensive that a<br>lot of the work was still done by humans<br>it was cheaper to pay human computers to<br>do the calculations and sorry through<br>largely women did this work as<br>human computers and and did some of the<br>early computer programming because that<br>was largely considered clerical work<br>suitable for women<br>not real um difficult stuff we have a<br>different view today<br>throughout the 1950s and 60s programming<br>was considered to be a bit of a black<br>art led by a priesthood of programmers<br>because you couldn't<br>study it anywhere<br>there were no computing degrees<br>and so people learned by themselves or<br>off others<br>and this<br>apparently these programmers weren't<br>loyal to the companies that trained them<br>they went where the money was and so<br>there was a real demand for programmers<br>which led to the development of<br>computer science departments so in 1962<br>purdue university created the first<br>computer science department<br>and the university of illinois followed<br>not long after in 64 with 1967 the first<br>masters of science degree awarded in<br>the<br>university of illinois and that's<br>important because my parents-in-law<br>ivan<br>reilly and barbara miller riley had<br>traveled to the university of illinois<br>where ivan was doing his phd in<br>mathematics and so barbara used her time<br>working for the engineering school and<br>learned to program computers<br>and decided<br>to complete a master's degree in<br>computer science graduating in 1970.<br>so this is barbara<br>and<br>others<br>and i love this photo because it's<br>really typical of women's experience in<br>computer science perhaps not to this<br>extreme<br>but it captures the sentiment<br>wonderfully<br>now if you weren't quite sure just how<br>small new zealand is<br>when they came back to new zealand in<br>1970<br>barbara worked at the school of<br>engineering and she job shared with<br>jennifer lennon who you may remember<br>in 1968 the acm<br>wasn't enthused about<br>computer science as an academic<br>discipline<br>and the real problem was the curriculum<br>because there was no standard curriculum<br>and there was no agreement about what to<br>teach or what to emphasize<br>every curriculum was different<br>and so at this point i'm going to steal<br>from mati tedri who has done some work<br>in this area and give you some<br>definitions of what computer science is<br>so it's the study of computing machines<br>either actual or potential<br>the study of computers and the phenomena<br>surrounding them the study of the theory<br>and practice of programming computers<br>the art and science of representing and<br>processing information the study of<br>information structures<br>the body of knowledge dealing with<br>processes that transform information the<br>study of algorithms it's a natural<br>science an artificial science<br>an unnatural science<br>a speculative science a laboratory<br>science a social science<br>it's what can be automated it's what can<br>be efficiently automated automation of<br>our abstractions it's the science of<br>abstractions it's the study of<br>procedures it's a branch of philosophy<br>it's a mathematical science<br>a new paradigm of science a spectrum<br>with science on one end in engineering<br>on the other a new species of<br>engineering information engineering<br>engineering of mathematics engineering<br>of abstract objects conceptual<br>engineering a technological discipline a<br>language of technology it's about tools<br>and techniques for designing and<br>building applications<br>and<br>according to the university of auckland<br>the study of computers and computer<br>concepts their systems design<br>development and use<br>and i would like to add to that<br>and where it's disrupted<br>well it's disrupted everything around<br>the world but one of the places it's<br>disrupted is our teaching environment<br>now the lecture<br>has been a tradition<br>going back perhaps since the middle ages<br>and<br>in the 1990s diana lorelaird<br>described it as an enfeebling 800 years<br>we give lectures or we used to<br>because<br>the access to information was so limited<br>the quality of a university was defined<br>in part by the size of their library<br>because the only source of information<br>was books<br>or people<br>and<br>books were scarce<br>and it was hard to get them many of the<br>courses that were around when i took had<br>books on short loan you could get them<br>for an hour at a time and then you had<br>to give them back<br>and so there was value in memorizing<br>information because the cost of getting<br>it any other way was so high<br>teaching was very much an ephemeral<br>activity it was an experience that you<br>came to class to take part in because if<br>you weren't in class there was no other<br>way to get the information<br>the books didn't exist<br>in our library for some of that content<br>and so you had to listen to what was<br>said and avidly write your own textbook<br>and i used to have big refill<br>filled folders of all of my notes for<br>years and years and i'd spent so much<br>effort writing them<br>i really hated to give them away so i<br>kept them for 15 years before i<br>eventually threw them out i had big<br>stacks of these notes<br>and the<br>lack<br>of attention lack of competition for<br>attention meant that you could focus on<br>the learning<br>but in<br>1994 which was the year i started<br>teaching<br>the web<br>became publicly available and it changed<br>everything<br>at this point when we started teaching<br>this<br>yahoo was the main access to information<br>and it was manually indexed<br>people looked at every new web page and<br>added it like you would in a card<br>catalog system to a list of manually<br>maintained<br>pages<br>we had to teach students what email was<br>what forums were what chat groups were<br>in 1990 when i started<br>studying computer science<br>we programmed on these devices using<br>disks like this so we had one to boot<br>from and one to store our information on<br>so today at home i've got 14 terabytes<br>of data which is around 14 million<br>times as much as this<br>so i worked out if you stacked these up<br>one on top of the other it's about 10<br>kilometers<br>of these devices<br>the information that we have these days<br>and that makes education more complex<br>we've gone from very small quantities of<br>very controlled information to large<br>quantities of uncontrolled information<br>and students have<br>a lot of competition for their attention<br>we know<br>web browsers students have 27 different<br>tabs open and notifications and<br>different streams of information and the<br>research on this says context switching<br>takes cognitive space it makes your<br>learning less effective<br>proportionately less of our teaching and<br>learning happens in person and it<br>happens<br>out there away from this environment and<br>so academic teachers have shifted from<br>sage on the stage the<br>person who has the knowledge to a<br>curator of knowledge collecting and<br>delivering<br>knowledge we think is relevant<br>and i think we're entering now a<br>disruptive phase in education<br>where the standard model that we've been<br>using for 800 years is nearing the end<br>so the question is<br>how do we make informed choices<br>about our teaching<br>when everything is changing<br>and for that<br>we all<br>have<br>all of the academics teachers have been<br>through our education system<br>and so we've learned in a particular way<br>and it's largely been effective for us<br>so we tend to repeat that when we're<br>teaching<br>and so a lot of the approaches we take<br>are folk wisdom<br>anecdotes gut instinct we don't have<br>research or data<br>so when i was learning how to teach they<br>talked to us about different learning<br>styles and the vac inventory visual<br>auditory read write kinesthetic these<br>are different ways that people learn<br>well it turns out<br>that's not the way that people learn at<br>all<br>that<br>this<br>fits into that category of something<br>that feels<br>kind of satisfying<br>so scholarly teachers are those that are<br>aware of the literature<br>and use that literature to inform what<br>they do in the classroom<br>conduct systematic observations analyze<br>going one step further the scholarship<br>of teaching and learning is when you<br>publish that information<br>and share it widely among your broader<br>community<br>so we have<br>teachers and inside that scholarly<br>teaching<br>and<br>some of scholarly teaching becomes<br>this is an example of a working group<br>report that we did<br>2007<br>and we looked at all of the research<br>that's out there around introductory<br>programming which is something i'm quite<br>interested in so we started with five<br>thousand papers um reduced those down to<br>sixteen hundred papers and we read all<br>1600 papers<br>and<br>tried to piece together and synthesize<br>what those papers said and one of the<br>things we did is track<br>how<br>this<br>research area has grown over time and<br>over that 15-year period it's increased<br>by three to four times<br>so<br>so this suggests a lot more people are<br>engaged in formal scholarship of<br>teaching and learning it's a growing<br>the sort of thing this tells us<br>is<br>internationally<br>benchmarks for<br>student engagement with computing<br>are poor<br>that made me feel good because it's not<br>just my department<br>right the rest of the world sees similar<br>things stem tends to have lower student<br>engagement than other areas humanities<br>is always quite high stem is lower<br>one of the things that's changed<br>has been as all of our education is fed<br>through the web<br>we can collect more data than we ever<br>have before<br>in our lives<br>we know a lot about our students all of<br>the learning resources are served<br>digitally all of the activities are<br>mediated through these learning<br>environments we collect their<br>assessments digitally and so we can use<br>that information to tell us about our<br>students<br>so one good example here is the sort of<br>forensic analysis that yuho has done um<br>he's a colleague and co-author of mine<br>this is his work not mine though<br>so<br>he was using keystroke data analysis so<br>what that means is when you type your<br>program in every single character you<br>type is recorded and so people know or<br>the system collects the exact time<br>and key that you press as you're<br>programming and students would use this<br>environment to do their assignments and<br>do their tests and so on<br>now one thing you can do is look at the<br>different keys and the speed at which<br>they're<br>pressed so if you press the letter f<br>followed by the letter o they can look<br>at that time difference and each of us<br>has a different pattern in the way that<br>we type<br>and so you can use this<br>to build up a signature<br>by analyzing pairs of keystrokes build a<br>profile and in fact this can identify<br>so if you were delivering an exam<br>through distance learning you would be<br>able to know pretty well<br>if that student was the person typing or<br>not<br>now you might not know who else is in<br>the room<br>but he also did this further analysis so<br>this graph<br>shows<br>progress towards the final submission<br>that they've made<br>so on the vertical axis is what's called<br>the edit distance and on the bottom is<br>all of the things that they've done<br>so when they submit<br>their assignment having worked on this<br>particular question<br>then the edit distance is zero because<br>that's the version that they actually<br>submitted<br>at the start<br>when the<br>page is blank then they've got 2 000<br>characters to get to their solution so<br>as they type more and more of their<br>solution is developed and so you see<br>this progress coming down and the<br>students up and down a little bit<br>but they're making steady progress and<br>this is typical<br>when you see a pattern like this<br>you can see that they've sort of stalled<br>and they're not making any progress and<br>then suddenly<br>they're making a big<br>increase<br>what does this look like<br>well this is copying and pasting<br>probably from somebody else's answer and<br>so very easy to detect in the pattern<br>and so some students who knew this was<br>happening by the way<br>may have taken a different approach what<br>now of course if you're problem solving<br>it's not going to be so steady this is<br>the characteristic pattern of somebody<br>that is typing at even speed<br>as they're solving this problem so if<br>you had somebody else's solution that<br>you were typing in this is what you<br>might see so this sort of analysis can<br>detect student behavior as well as<br>identity i think this is really<br>but we're only starting to make<br>effective use of this sort of<br>information you may have seen this<br>example before because this has been<br>around a long time amsterdam airport in<br>1997 they tried this out and essentially<br>etched<br>into the men's urinals these little<br>pictures of flies<br>and it saved them a significant amount<br>systems design behavioral economics<br>nudge theory gamification all ways of<br>subtly impacting behavior without<br>explicitly telling people what behavior<br>you're after and this sort of<br>data that we get educational data can<br>help inform these sorts of<br>approaches<br>so some of the work that i've been<br>involved with systems that support<br>student peer review<br>so looking at the difference between the<br>marks that students give to other<br>students if they're asked to grade their<br>peers compared with the tutors<br>you can see in yellow the difference in<br>percentages between what the peers gave<br>and what the tutors gave and it's not<br>that much<br>as long as you get enough pairs together<br>and the magic number is about six<br>then they can produce<br>marks that are pretty much the same as<br>what the tutors give<br>their comments are a little bit less<br>insightful but there's a lot more of<br>them and they're generated much faster<br>so that might be a trade-off that<br>they're willing to make but students<br>then complain that we're asking them to<br>do<br>our jobs<br>we want them to mark for us and they<br>don't realize the other benefits<br>but we can use gamification<br>to turn this into a game<br>and so we can say if you do your peer<br>reviews and you do a good job we'll give<br>you a gold star<br>and it turns out even adults<br>will do a lot more if you're giving them<br>a gold star no grades associated with it<br>it doesn't have any meaningful input<br>into their their transcript or anything<br>all they get are these little pictures<br>well done<br>and yet it significantly changes the<br>behavior that students<br>present with their<br>activities produce more specific<br>we know that students who are working<br>together<br>during the year score higher when<br>they're asked to do an individual exam<br>so we have data saying working together<br>with others is a good thing<br>we know that men<br>tend to be over confident all students<br>tend to be overconfident but men are<br>more overconfident than women when<br>they're<br>trying to<br>predict whether they got questions<br>correct or not<br>and that's important because if we rely<br>on confidence<br>one of the other parts of teaching<br>scholarship is having these critical<br>perspectives and thinking about the<br>discipline<br>in computer science there is a sense<br>that programming is hard that this is<br>some kind of elite subject that only the<br>top students can be involved with<br>so the top quote is from a professor at<br>otago the bottom one is from probably<br>the world's leading computing education<br>expert<br>and he says maybe the task of<br>programming is innately one of the most<br>complex cognitive tasks that humans have<br>ever created i think that might be<br>overstating<br>things just a little<br>but this<br>feeling this mindset<br>is really common among computing<br>educators and 30 years of research have<br>shown that students perform at lower<br>than expected levels and what this tells<br>but nevertheless<br>in these research papers these people<br>who are expert educators are teachers<br>with a lot of experience and expert in<br>computing education research<br>say that they are surprised<br>and i find that fascinating<br>equally this is a post from<br>one of the mailing lists computing<br>education research<br>and they were talking about the first<br>lecture of their introductory<br>programming course and this is what they<br>and i find this fascinating<br>that<br>educators can see this and share it<br>among other educators and then say<br>but that's our discipline and they move<br>on<br>when we look at the way we assess<br>students in first year programming<br>and this is not a bad question<br>but this question involves a lot of<br>different concepts<br>okay you have to know about loops you<br>have to know about conditions you have<br>to know about all of these operators and<br>types and so on<br>and the problem with this is one<br>conceptual misunderstanding means you<br>get the wrong answer and it doesn't<br>matter which of these different bits you<br>when we look at our exams every single<br>question looks like this<br>and so if you have a misunderstanding it<br>and some of our processes are initially<br>unintuitive you'd think 0.1 plus 0.1<br>plus 0.1 would be equal to 0.3<br>turns out on some computers it's not the<br>case<br>if you round the value 1.5 to an integer<br>it goes to 2 if you round 2.5 also goes<br>to 2.<br>the dependencies between different<br>syntax and java look like this<br>and yet we expect students to master all<br>in their very first course<br>now the dangers of us<br>thinking this is normal<br>is that when students fail out we can<br>blame the students<br>we don't have to reflect on our own<br>teaching<br>it makes the workload for those students<br>extremely high<br>and at impact it increases the impact of<br>prior experience so if you already know<br>how to program when you start you're<br>going to do okay<br>now it turns out<br>men tend to have more experience<br>before they start university and<br>programming than women<br>and academic disciplines more broadly<br>than computer science in which<br>brilliance is necessary for success have<br>less gender diversity now we know that<br>computer science is not necessarily<br>now this data only goes to 2015 but in<br>science we have pretty good<br>representation of women in computer<br>now i know it's not only<br>academic environments that impact this<br>and i present to you an example from<br>2010<br>where the makers of barbie released the<br>computer engineer barbie<br>along with the book<br>i can be a computer engineer and this is<br>intended to attract more girls into<br>computing<br>okay and it starts off quite good barbie<br>is hard at work what are you doing says<br>her sister i'm designing a game that<br>shows kids how computers work you can<br>make a robot puppy do cute tricks by<br>matching up blocks great stuff<br>the puppy's sweet says skipper can i<br>play it i'm only creating the design<br>ideas barbie says i'll need steven and<br>now barbie then gets a virus on her<br>computer and doesn't know how to deal<br>with it so naturally she turns to steve<br>and brian<br>who offer to help her<br>and<br>she needs help to get it done so stephen<br>helpfully says it'll go faster if brian<br>and i help great says barbie and you can<br>see steven and brian are the ones<br>actually doing the work while barbie's<br>holding this cd<br>yay i can be a computer engineer too<br>so as a discipline we're fighting<br>as our world becomes more complex<br>and students are dealing with the<br>complexity of that world and the demands<br>on their attention<br>we need to make more use of our<br>educational data<br>and get more sophisticated in our<br>strategies<br>we need to be challenging these<br>traditions and teaching scholarship is<br>the way forward<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
