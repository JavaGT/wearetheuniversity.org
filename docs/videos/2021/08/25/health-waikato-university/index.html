as human<br>performance sport and exercise science<br>this presentation will focus on what we<br>have to offer within our bachelor of<br>health and bachelor of health sport and<br>human performance degrees we also have a<br>nursing degree which is being presented<br>separately<br>bachelor of health is your gateway to<br>health careers<br>the bachelor of health is a newly<br>launched<br>multi-disciplinary program<br>there's no bachelor of health<br>uh like this anywhere else in aotearoa<br>new zealand<br>we consider health from the molecular<br>and cellular level right through to the<br>whole of population a strong mature<br>maori thread throughout the program<br>and we draw on multiple perspectives of<br>health personal social scientific<br>cultural historical political and<br>economic<br>this is because we recognize<br>that health is an enormously<br>complex<br>field<br>it has multiple factors that impact on<br>it and there are multiple valid ways of<br>understanding and approaching health<br>we have a clear focus on how the health<br>care system currently works and what<br>could be done to improve it we consider<br>the past and present of health care in<br>aotearoa new zealand and we're preparing<br>graduates who are ready to create a new<br>there are two majors within the bachelor<br>of health potential population health<br>this focuses on health<br>people's homes<br>in their context such as whanau<br>community hapu ewi and the whole of<br>society context if you think about the<br>government's response to covet 19 over<br>the last 18 or so months this is this<br>comes from a population health<br>perspective<br>the use of things like mask wearing<br>social distancing and various levels of<br>lockdown to eliminate covert 19 within<br>new zealand represent a population<br>health approach<br>we have integrative knowledge of<br>theories and analytical approaches to<br>health and well-being<br>we incorporate hawara and matura maori<br>into health practice<br>and there's a clear and strong focus on<br>inequities and disparities in health and<br>health care and a real focus on<br>identifying how these inequities and<br>disparities<br>can be removed<br>this doesn't just come from tinkering<br>around the edges it involves rethinking<br>how health and health care can be<br>delivered in order to remove<br>barriers to care inequities and<br>disparities<br>potumaru biomedical sciences has more of<br>a focus<br>on the molecular and cellular<br>aspects of health<br>so it is a multifaceted and applied<br>health sciences major which takes an<br>integrative approach to biomedical<br>sciences the important aspect of this is<br>it doesn't just take the cellular and<br>molecular level of health it brings that<br>alongside matura maori health<br>communication and bioethics to think<br>about how we can try and<br>cover all aspects of health and not just<br>consider what's happening inside the<br>body but relate what's happening inside<br>the body to that broader context and so<br>you develop biomedical understandings<br>knowledge and practical skills which are<br>valuable in the workplace<br>so quote from one of our first year be<br>health students this degree combines<br>everything i'm interested in that i can<br>build on for the future and this is a<br>degree for students who want to<br>contribute to a positive future for all<br>aotearoa new zealand<br>in terms of potential careers you may<br>have heard that the university of<br>waikato is currently pursuing<br>the idea of a graduate entry medical<br>school<br>this would be a medical school<br>specifically for people who have already<br>finished another qualification another<br>three-year qualification a bachelor<br>degree<br>the bachelor of health would be ideal<br>preparation for a graduate entry medical<br>school<br>but there'll be lots of you who<br>won't have that as a priority right now<br>and will be thinking well what else<br>could i do with the bachelor of health<br>some of these roles here might appeal to<br>you working in allied health professions<br>being a laboratory technician being a<br>health protection officer or a health<br>science writer health science writer's<br>job was to make sense of really<br>technical detailed scient health science<br>research and make it accessible and<br>meaningful for a general audience<br>being a health policy officer or a<br>health policy<br>developer or policy writer<br>being a health researcher<br>managing a healthcare program being a<br>healthcare advocate or advisor or an ewe<br>or community based health education<br>officer<br>our other program the bachelor of spell<br>health sport and human performance is<br>all about growing knowledgeable<br>individuals who can contribute to the<br>communities of aotearoa and new zealand<br>this means this program is about<br>developing leaders in health and sports<br>science<br>social

and<br>for a great student experience<br>there's a wide range of study choices<br>within the degree we have three majors<br>community health human performance<br>science and sport development and<br>coaching<br>the first year of the degree has five<br>common papers across the majors so it's<br>very easy to switch within the degree if<br>you want<br>to the community health major focuses on<br>health promotion this is about working<br>with people in their communities to<br>identify the changes that they would<br>like to make to improve their health and<br>to help them implement those changes we<br>focus on how water as the prime way in<br>which health is conceptualized and<br>understood<br>we focus on social determinants of<br>health these are the societal level<br>factors that are the prime<br>causes of ill health and health<br>inequities within new zealand<br>and we understand and focus on the<br>impacts of the digital era<br>on health and health care everything<br>from instagram and tick tock right<br>through to dhp's digital health records<br>we work with a wide range of<br>organizations waikato dhb water safety<br>new zealand and<br>te tai timu trust which is

health provider<br>hierarchy pho sport waco the list goes<br>on<br>and students often ask us are there jobs<br>at the end of it the answer is yes<br>community health<br>is a sector in which employees are in<br>demand and most specifically when we<br>look at health promotion which is the<br>key focus of the community health major<br>there are a wide range of jobs<br>across the health sector for people<br>skilled and health promotion<br>and so jobs that might come out of this<br>often relate to health promotion but<br>they might have a wide range of job<br>titles kaifina health navigator a health<br>advocate a health coach a health and<br>well-being program coordinator a<br>population health coordinator<br>all relate to health promotion<br>similarly being a health teacher a<br>program manager community advisor also<br>roles that you'll be prepared for within<br>this major<br>moving to sport development and coaching<br>within this major we look at sport as a<br>tool for development

of you will be aware of the role<br>that high performance athletes have have<br>played<br>over the last 18 or so months<br>for social justice movements such as<br>black lives matter and america<br>we teach skills around stakeholder<br>management athlete-centred coaching<br>approaches and using technology to<br>inform your practice<br>there are a wide range of organizations<br>that we work with such as sport wakato<br>sport nz high performance sport new<br>zealand right up to the international<br>olympic committee we work with national<br>sports organizations<br>and other national organizations such as<br>paraffin nz<br>physical education new zealand surf<br>lifesaving new zealand and regional<br>organizations like waikato badminton we<br>integrate with high schools and

organizations<br>to be well run and to offer meaningful<br>sport and recreation experiences<br>to their communities<br>and so the sorts of jobs that are<br>available and the types of job titles<br>would be sport development officer a<br>community recreation advisor a coach<br>developer you if you're interested in<br>health and pe teaching this is an ideal<br>major for you being a sports coordinator<br>a sport and recreation policy advisor a<br>program manager an event manager these<br>are all the types of jobs that you can<br>build through your major in sport<br>development and coaching<br>our third major is human performance<br>science this is an umbrella term for a<br>range of scientific approaches to<br>understanding human performance<br>when we talk about human performance<br>science people immediately think of<br>elite athletes<br>super rugby players<br>of the olympics but the reality is that<br>human performance science incorporates<br>approaches that are valuable for all<br>levels of engagement and sport and<br>this major uses facilities<br>on both our campuses at<br>university of waikato in hamilton and<br>tauranga and a range of high-performance<br>sports facilities such as the adams<br>center for high performance in tauranga<br>and the chiefs headquarters within<br>hamilton<br>we have a sports laboratory at the<br>advantage room which you'll have access<br>to and we have a collaboration agreement<br>with total mai in tauranga to use their<br>facilities to deliver the bachelor of<br>health sport and human performance in<br>tauranga<br>there's a wide range of organizations<br>that we work with in human performance<br>science you'll see that many of these<br>are about<br>high performance sport but many of these<br>organizations span<br>sport that goes well beyond just high<br>performance through to community level<br>and even the waikato dhb where human<br>performance scientists are working with<br>surgeons and<br>arrange on a range of<br>issues and difficulties and looking at<br>how we can improve recovery from surgery<br>the jobs question again<br>and the answer again is yes there are<br>jobs for graduates with human<br>performance science majors<br>in the health sport and human<br>performance degree a wide range of jobs<br>and<br>moving forward just taking an example<br>from the uk looking at the impact of<br>sport and exercise science education on<br>the uk economy<br>3.9 billion pound contribution<br>this indicates that this is a field that<br>has big impact<br>we're very similar to the uk we're not<br>quite so big they've got 60 million<br>people we've got 5 million people so the<br>total<br>impact in new zealand dollars won't be<br>the equivalent of 3.9 billion pounds but<br>it's still very impactful<br>key point at the bottom<br>is graduates and sport and exercise<br>sciences are employed in the field very<br>very quickly within six months of<br>graduating<br>and what sorts of jobs will you be<br>looking at with human performance<br>science a sport and exercise science<br>clinician strength and conditioning<br>coach performance analyst a sports<br>scientist a coach sports administrator<br>program manager<br>health and lifestyle promoter personal<br>trainer you'll see across the<br>jobs that we've outlined between these<br>three majors that there's some overlap<br>between these majors as well<br>thanks for your time and attention i<br>look forward to meeting you all in your<br>first year of study in tihuataki wilder<br>school of health and either the bachelor<br>of health or the bachelor of health</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
