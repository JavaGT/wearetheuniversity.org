100% accurate.</p><p>hi my name is dr tim walmsley and i'm a<br>lecturer in chemical engineering here at<br>the university of wakator<br>i'm going to talk to you a little bit<br>about why i think you should consider<br>studying professional engineering at<br>waikato<br>there's four main questions that i want<br>to cover<br>first why is it that we need<br>professional engineers<br>when i consider this question what i<br>immediately think of is the grand<br>challenges that we face<br>we face all sorts of challenges such as<br>the infrastructure and construction<br>challenge how do we build buildings that<br>are cheap that are sustainable that<br>aren't going to fall down in 10 years<br>time that aren't going to leak in 10<br>years time<br>that are energy efficient these are this<br>is all part of a construction and<br>infrastructure challenge that we need to<br>i guess address as a society in order to<br>move forward<br>another massive challenge that we face<br>is around energy and decarbonisation<br>there's a lot of talk at the moment<br>around climate change and how do we<br>transition to<br>an economy and a i guess a system where<br>we can have the energy that we need<br>but we can have it in a clean and<br>sustainable way<br>and so this is all part of a challenge<br>in order for us to move and transition<br>from our current energy environment to a<br>sustainable and renewable energy<br>environment<br>another massive challenge is the<br>circular materials or circular economy<br>challenge<br>how do we take all of the waste<br>reprocess it reuse it upcycle it how do<br>we take our waste and design materials<br>so that they are inherently easier to<br>circularize<br>another area where we have a massive<br>challenge and opportunity is in robotics<br>and ai<br>ai is one of these areas which have<br>started to penetrate many parts of<br>engineering and coupled with all the<br>different technologies that we have in<br>order to improve them<br>and robotics is one of the primary<br>applications<br>the next question that i want to address<br>is are all professional engineers the<br>same<br>well we do have the same base skill set<br>you can say that a professional engineer<br>is a combination and loves a combination<br>of science math design<br>and business<br>and so what that means is we apply maths<br>and science and design<br>to really big complex problems<br>and so we have to possess some practical<br>abilities not just theoretical abilities<br>but all of this has to be given in a<br>business context in a way that we can<br>add value to a company to an<br>organization<br>and to society at large and also reduce<br>costs<br>this requires not just the application<br>of rote<br>science and maths but also<br>a element of creativity and innovation<br>and so we have to think out of the box<br>we also have to think about not just<br>working as engineers but also connecting<br>with other disciplines such as<br>lawyers and accountants and business<br>people and so that we can work together<br>at waikato we have eight programs that<br>cover all the different types of<br>engineering we have civil engineering<br>and environmental engineering<br>we have chemical bio and biological<br>engineering as well as materials and<br>process engineering<br>we have mechanical and mechatronics<br>engineering<br>and finally we have electrical and<br>electronic engineering and software<br>engineering<br>what you can see here is we cover the<br>four main pillars of engineering<br>civil<br>mechanical chemical and electrical and<br>we have many programs that fit in<br>between so we've got materials and<br>software that apply in many of the other<br>programs and we've got environmental<br>that sits between a civil engineer and a<br>chemical engineer and we also have a<br>mechatronics engineer that sits between<br>the software the mechanical and the<br>mechatronics<br>the third question which i want to<br>address is what does engineering at<br>waikato look like<br>well here's some of the photos from our<br>first year boat race that you would<br>experience<br>in the trimester first year<br>all the first years form teams and they<br>have to<br>design boats that can gather and clean<br>up rubbish from our lake<br>here are some of the projects that are<br>happening here at waikato we have the<br>tokumaru bay restoration project that<br>our fourth year engineers are<br>heavily involved with and trying to find<br>more advanced and new materials that we<br>can use to strengthen the pillars around<br>the tokumaru bay wharf<br>we have our wesmo team that is designing<br>and building a small little race car to<br>present and to race at the australasian<br>competition<br>we have teams that have worked on uh<br>super capacitor e-bikes where they've<br>designed and built an e-bike that can<br>charge as you go downhills and give<br>assistance when you're going uphills<br>and then we also have projects that are<br>around things like asparagus harvesting<br>where we're harvesting asparagus from<br>fields and using machine learning and<br>machine vision in order to detect<br>a an asparagus shoot<br>and then mechanical<br>arms come down harvest the shoots<br>so if you really want to know what does<br>engineering at waikato look like i<br>invite you to come and join us at the<br>waikato engineering design show<br>this show is in october<br>on the 19th and 20th<br>and will be held at the gallagher<br>the last question that i want to address<br>is why is it that you should choose<br>waikato to study professional<br>engineering why not choose one of the<br>other schools<br>well there are four reasons which i<br>think<br>set us apart<br>first we have hundreds of scholarships<br>and many of our engineering students are<br>able to win these scholarships so if you<br>have<br>marital excellence<br>or you've got some special circumstance<br>that you believe qualifies you for a<br>scholarship<br>apply<br>don't be afraid<br>most of these scholarships are due at<br>the end of august<br>and they're granted to you<br>well in advance of whether you choose to<br>another reason why our program is just<br>so fantastic is we have great industry<br>connections which leads to amazing work<br>placements for our students<br>and then leads to jobs after they<br>graduate<br>another reason why i think<br>waikato is unique is because you have<br>the opportunity to add a strong business<br>edge to your degree<br>so you can study<br>engineering and also management on the<br>side<br>and so at wakato we have a diploma in<br>engineering management that you can do<br>concurrent with the bachelor of<br>engineering with honours<br>final reason which i give as to what<br>sets us apart is we have really amazing<br>research centers<br>our centers are aligned to grand<br>challenges<br>that we face as a society<br>so we have things like advanced<br>materials<br>water<br>infrastructure robotics and energy as<br>our main five focuses<br>and in the last five years we've been<br>able to attract over 50 million dollars<br>in funding<br>so just to conclude my presentation here<br>are some of the pathways that can help<br>you get into engineering at waikato<br>if you have all of the entry<br>requirements of the mass and physics<br>credits from level 3 then you can have<br>direct entry into our first year<br>if you're missing some of the credits<br>then<br>you might consider doing our jump start<br>program that happens in february or if<br>you're missing a few more credits you<br>might consider doing a certificate of<br>university preparation first<br>in order to fully prepare you for the<br>first year of engineering<br>so if you want to be part of solving<br>grand challenges i encourage you to come<br>to waikato be part of the solution and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
