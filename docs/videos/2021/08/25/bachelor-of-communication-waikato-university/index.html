employers<br>leadership skills organizational skills<br>social media skills<br>website building<br>communication skills<br>if you chose communication skills you're<br>right<br>but<br>guess what if you

career in the<br>communication industry so let's have a<br>look at what the vc offers<br>first let's have a look at the overall<br>bachelor of communication structure<br>so um<br>here's the<br>table uh of the overview so first of all<br>let's talk about the core in white so<br>the core contains seven papers which you<br>will have to take<br>so these papers cover introductions to<br>specific important areas of<br>communication studies for example<br>commons 103 focuses on organizational<br>communication<br>commons 103<br>102 on the impacts of electronically<br>mediated communication on our lives such<br>as social media how it influences our<br>identity our behavior etc<br>you also have papers on communication<br>ethics intercultural communication and<br>then in the third year you have a work<br>integrated paper for which you can do an<br>internship so in yellow outside the core<br>you can focus on a particular subject<br>called the major that's nine papers in<br>the same subject<br>we'll see the range of majors next so<br>you can do a bc<br>focusing on one or two majors the slide<br>shows you the bc with a single major<br>so if you decide to take a single major<br>then you can also do a minor with it<br>which is four papers in the same field<br>or you can choose electives from<br>any subject across the university for<br>example you may want to take a language<br>french for example or anything that<br>interests you<br>if you take a double major each major<br>so there are five majors to choose from<br>in the bachelor of communication and<br>these are<br>public relations marketing creative<br>media media production and applied<br>digital communication<br>you can take<br>miners<br>from any subject<br>almost any subject<br>some minors are good fit and that are<br>popular in the bc uh on the slide here<br>and you can take elective papers from<br>almost any subject across the university<br>so<br>let's talk about the various majors on<br>offer in turn<br>so first public relations uh the first<br>public relations major<br>so public relations is about building<br>relationships with publics it's about<br>helping organizations frame messages so<br>they are positively received by the<br>received by the public so you may have<br>heard that some people are afraid of<br>being vaccinated against kovid at the<br>moment right so many governments across<br>the world have actually launched public<br>relations campaigns to try to convince<br>people convince people<br>they should be vaccinated so<br>these campaigns so they will involve a<br>lot of decisions<br>um about whether you should use rational<br>arguments or emotional arguments or<br>emotional appeals as they called<br>for example fear appeals or humor<br>appeals<br>then you have to decide on message<br>source whether you need to use a famous<br>person for example then you have to make<br>decisions on which communication<br>channels should be used whether you<br>should use social media or more<br>traditional media<br>so this campaign in the uk for example<br>uses humor appeals as for example<br>using social media so that's that's<br>really interesting work<br>so here are the papers you will do in<br>the pr major um so public relations<br>professional working areas um<br>such a increased crisis management<br>government relations investor relations<br>event management fundraising employee<br>relations sponsorship<br>all these areas are covered in the in<br>one important thing to note about the pr<br>major<br>as it is unique to us here at the<br>university of waco waikato is that our<br>pr program is the only one in new<br>zealand and one of only four outside of<br>the united states whose public relations<br>program is certified by the public<br>this is the pr professional<br>organizations in the us they come and<br>assess us our program every four years<br>so what does this mean well basically<br>this is a guarantee of a world-class<br>public relations program because prsa<br>sets the gold standard for peer<br>education so this provides you and us<br>with an edge<br>and this will help you when you graduate<br>as you will be able to highlight this<br>accreditation on your cv to stand out<br>from the rest<br>so this kind of expectation also allows<br>you to<br>find jobs more easily overseas since<br>your program is certified by an<br>thing to note<br>when you study communication at wekato<br>especially public relations you are<br>given opportunities to network with<br>practitioners through<br>mixer mixer is the management<br>communication students association<br>so as a student in the bc you can become<br>a member of mixer which will provide you<br>with opportunities to meet professionals<br>in the industry visit workplaces and<br>make professional connections while<br>studying<br>something important mixer is affiliated<br>with prince the public relations<br>institute of new zealand so when you<br>join

influential<br>people uh from the industry so this has<br>helped a lot of our students<br>get jobs<br>the next major i want to talk about is<br>marketing so most of you know what<br>marketing is
