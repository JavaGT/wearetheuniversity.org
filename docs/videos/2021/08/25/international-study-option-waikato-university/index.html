witz and I work for the<br>University of w cutle in New Zealand and<br>today I'm going to be introducing you to<br>New Zealand as a study destination<br>telling you a bit about the University<br>of w cattle and why you might want to<br>choose to study with us and then uh<br>telling you a bit about some of the<br>programs our most popular programs that<br>we offer and during the presentation if<br>you have any questions please feel free<br>to type them in the chat function and<br>I'll answer them as we go<br>along so first of all to introduce you<br>to New Zealand you can see this is a map<br>of New Zealand you can see the north<br>Ireland where the majority of the<br>population lives and the South iseland<br>which is really one of the most<br>beautiful places in the world the total<br>population of New Zealand is about 5<br>million people about 2 million of those<br>live in ockland and there are eight<br>universities across New Zealand so the<br>University of w cutle is one of those<br>eight and our main campus is located in<br>the city of Hamilton um and we have a<br>secondary campus in the city of Tonga<br>which is just east of Hamilton there and<br>I always tell students um who are<br>looking at New Zealand that it really is<br>a laid-back and relaxed study<br>destination away from the big huge<br>universities crowds of international<br>students that you will find in other<br>countries and you'll really find that<br>you have a friendly safe uh relaxed<br>study experience in New Zealand and a<br>very high quality uh study experience as<br>well so why might you want to choose New<br>Zealand first of all as I've said<br>quality all New Zealand universities are<br>ranked within the top 500 uh worldwide<br>in the latest Qs world<br>rankings safety um the uh country of New<br>Zealand is actually the second most<br>peaceful country in the world the crime<br>rates are very low corruption rates are<br>very low and you'll really find that you<br>have a very safe experience if you come<br>to study with us there are great work<br>opportunities for students after<br>graduation which I'll talk about in a<br>minute and then also lifestyle um as<br>I've said New Zealand is easygoing and<br>really is full of studying natural<br>beauty that you'll you must explore if<br>you do come to study with<br>us so just to focus on employability and<br>uh poststudy work as well so the uh New<br>Zealand economy is currently strong and<br>is projected to remain strong in future<br>years despite<br>covid-19 we have something called the<br>long-term skill shortage list uh which<br>gives you an idea of where there are<br>skill shortages in New Zealand and it<br>might help you if you're looking to stay<br>in New Zealand long term um with your<br>choice of uh study your choice of<br>subject um when you come to study with<br>us and as I've said we have a really<br>good post study work pathway um that may<br>make it easier to stay in New Zealand<br>long-term all of our bachelor's and<br>master's degrees and also postgraduate<br>diploma programs uh meet the academic<br>eligibility requirements for a<br>three-year poststudy work visa that's if<br>you're studying face Toof face in New<br>Zealand onshore and if you are studying<br>a graduate diploma then you will meet<br>the academic requirement for a one-year<br>poststudy work visa upon<br>graduation the New Zealand government<br>publishes a um firstly a website but<br>secondly an app that you can download on<br>your smartphone called occupation<br>Outlook and this again gives you a good<br>idea of the subjects that you might want<br>to consider if you are looking to stay<br>in New Zealand long term and you're<br>interested in job opportunities so you<br>can see the link on this page here there<br>are three indicators when you search by<br>degree subject firstly income so the<br>amount of money that you will earn<br>secondly tuition fees the amount of<br>money you'll pay to study that subject<br>and thirdly job prospects so the<br>likelihood of getting a job after<br>graduation and I've picked out three<br>different areas that you might want to<br>consider here firstly engineering so you<br>can see that engineering professionals<br>have um High income medium fees tuition<br>fees and very good job prospects after<br>graduation the same goes for computing<br>so software developers High income<br>medium fees and very good job prospects<br>in New Zealand and finally accounting<br>the same thing very good income medium<br>to high fees but very very good job<br>prospects so if you are looking to stay<br>in New Zealand these are three areas<br>that you might want to consider when you<br>come to decide what to study with<br>us now I can't can't talk um uh and<br>cover everything in this presentation<br>without talking about<br>covid-19 so you may know that uh New<br>Zealand has actually dealt with covid-19<br>very well there have been very few cases<br>very few deaths but the reason for that<br>is that our borders have been closed<br>since March of last year and they will<br>be remaining closed it seems for the<br>rest of this year also so Visa<br>processing for uh International students<br>visas um this is not happening this the<br>Visas will not be processed until at<br>least February of next year um 2021<br>intakes will be online we have an intake<br>coming up in November for a selection of<br>programs and those programs will be<br>online and then once our borders do<br>reopen hopefully next year then you'll<br>be able to come to New Zealand and cons<br>and continue your studies face to face<br>um we're waiting for further<br>announcements from the new Zealand<br>government as to when that will be but<br>we are hoping that when the New Zealand<br>population has been fully vaccinated<br>which should happen by the end of this<br>year we will start to see the borders<br>open<br>up so during this time we're accepting<br>provisional and calculated grades we're<br>also accepting online English tests such<br>as iot indicator and jool lingo which<br>means you don't need to go to a test<br>center for an English test um and we're<br>offering full support for online<br>students so you'll have a dedicated<br>tutor that you can speak to um you'll<br>have uh all of your lectures recorded so<br>you can access them uh at the time that<br>suits you and uh full it and online<br>support uh throughout your online<br>studies so to introduce now the<br>University of w to tell you a little bit<br>more about why you might want to choose<br>y cutle as your study<br>destination um as I've said we have two<br>campuses our main campus in Hamilton and<br>our secondary campus in Tonga both on<br>the north island of New Zealand um<br>Hamilton has about 160,000 people toon<br>got about 130,000 so they're quite small<br>cities but as I say very safe very<br>friendly really nice places to live and<br>to study we have a total of around<br>12,000 students and around 2,000<br>International students and we have a<br>range of programs and I've picked out a<br>few um important points uh for our<br>popular programs here so firstly our<br>business school W cutle management<br>school has Triple Crown accreditation so<br>we're accredited by aacb Eis and Amba<br>and these are the three most important<br>business bodies worldwide only around a<br>100 universities in the world have this<br>accreditation so it's really great for<br>your CV if you're looking um to get a<br>job after graduation having a degree<br>from W cutle management school from a<br>Triple Crown AC redtive management<br>school will really help you there we<br>have New Zealand's largest supercomputer<br>an excellent cyber security and<br>artificial intelligence facilities we<br>also have excellent research in that<br>area we have expertise and commitment to<br>environment and sustainability including<br>our Coastal Marine Field Station in<br>Tonga um many of our Olympic athletes um<br>trained at the uh University of w cattle<br>Adams Center which is in Tunga and you<br>may have seen New Zealand's excellent<br>performance in the Olympics this month<br>um a number of gold medals and a number<br>of those gold medal winners were<br>University of w cutle graduates who had<br>trained at the Adams<br>Center all of our bachelor's degrees and<br>a number of our postgraduate programs<br>include internships and placement<br>opportunities uh which means you can get<br>the work experience you need um in order<br>to hopefully find the job you're looking<br>for after graduation and we have study<br>abroad and exchange opportunities which<br>means you can go and uh study with one<br>of our University Partners overseas for<br>one or two trimesters trimesters during<br>your<br>studies and then finally cost um<br>studying in New Zealand is generally<br>cheaper than many other countries<br>worldwide and living costs in the<br>smaller cities of Hamilton and Tonga um<br>are cheaper compared to bigger cities<br>such as ockland cityy and Melbourne and<br>that particularly goes for rental costs<br>um when you're looking to uh to find<br>somewhere to<br>live so you can see Hamilton here this<br>is Hamilton City you can see the Y cutle<br>river running through it's a really<br>beautiful Green City um it has a very uh<br>strong student Community we have the<br>University of w cattle and wintech which<br>is a poly Technic institution um in<br>Hamilton as well so there are lots of<br>students and um it's a very safe place<br>very easy to get around um it has<br>everything you need really for your<br>studies you can see the bridge that goes<br>across the river um and that goes out to<br>our Hamilton campus it's about a<br>15minute bus ride from the city center<br>to the Hamilton campus and buses go very<br>regularly every half an hour between the<br>city and the<br>campus and you can see our Hamilton<br>campus here so again a beautiful Green<br>campus a really beautiful place to be<br>based for your studies um we have the<br>Village Green which is in the middle of<br>the campus that's really the Central<br>meeting point there are cafes<br>restaurants um shops and so on um and<br>many students meet there sit on the<br>grass for lunch and so on um we have<br>Halls of residents on our campus you can<br>see just in the bottom right hand corner<br>of this picture that's one of our Halls<br>of residence but we actually have four<br>Halls spread across the campus so that<br>means you can live on campus and you can<br>walk to your lectures every day again a<br>really safe and friendly place to to<br>live<br>and then our secondary campus in the<br>city of Tonga so you can see a really<br>beautiful coastal city um there's lots<br>to see and do um it's a very<br>Cosmopolitan uh lifestyle in in Tanga<br>beautiful weather as well and you can<br>see our toonga campus just on in the<br>bottom right hand corner of that picture<br>so this is a new campus that was built<br>in 2019 we offer a selection of programs<br>here in toonga um we have high quality<br>teaching Cutting Edge search world-class<br>facilities of course to be expected from<br>a brand new campus and toonga itself is<br>a fast growing city actually the fastest<br>growing city in New Zealand and um we uh<br>we offer as I say a range of programs so<br>a selection of programs the um student<br>population is of course quite a bit<br>smaller everything is based in um our<br>sort of central campus Building that you<br>can see in this picture here so it<br>really again suits students who are<br>looking for that sort of close closer<br>more tight-knit student community and we<br>are offering a $10,000 New Zealand doll<br>tuition fee burer to International<br>students who start their studies um in<br>tooga um just because we're looking to<br>attract more International students to<br>come and study with us<br>here so moving on now to the programs<br>that we offer and I've picked out a<br>selection of programs that are popular<br>with International students you can see<br>a list of our faculties and schools of<br>study on this slide here um and as I say<br>I'm going to just go through a few<br>programs that you may find<br>interesting first of all the Bachelor of<br>Arts um so this is a three-year degree<br>it's a very flexible degree you can<br>choose a wide range of different majors<br>and you can see a list of all of the<br>majors um here 23 different Majors that<br>you can choose from you can do a single<br>major or a double major um or a major<br>and a minor depending on what you're<br>interested in we have three intakes<br>March July and November cost is between<br>25 and<br>33,000 New Zealand doll per year<br>depending on what you choose and there<br>are work placement opportunities um<br>available um with businesses in Hamilton<br>or Tonga um depending on the major that<br>you<br>choose then we have the Bachelor of<br>business this is the most popular<br>bachelor's degree we offer for<br>international students um this um as uh<br>with all of our nearly all of our<br>degrees is a three-year Bachelor degree<br>um intakes in March July and November<br>cost is just over $30,000 New Zealand<br>dollars per year um it's part of our<br>Triple Crown accredited management<br>school so one of the top percent of<br>management schools worldwide um we offer<br>a guaranteed one semester workplace<br>internship so that's one day per week um<br>for one semester of study and you can<br>see the majors that we offer just down<br>at the bottom of the page here nine<br>different Majors covering really all<br>areas of business<br>if you choose the accounting major then<br>you'll have um FastTrack to uh qualified<br>chartered accountancy status um and<br>you'll have nine Acca exemptions so uh<br>many accountants look to gain full Acca<br>accreditation and that requires taking<br>14 Acca exams and then getting some work<br>experience but if you study our<br>three-year Bachelor of business in<br>accounting you'll get nine exemptions<br>from the 14 exams meaning you'll just<br>need to take five more exams after you<br>graduate and get that work experience um<br>and then of course if you did want to um<br>gain an honors degree um which really<br>kind of leads you into master's degree<br>level study then you can take the<br>Bachelor of management studies which is<br>an extra year um and that's also<br>available then the Bachelor of Science<br>again similar to the uh other bachelor's<br>degrees I've talked about a choice of 12<br>different Majors listed here<br>um again there are work experience<br>opportunities available if you choose<br>the Bachelor of science technology<br>option you'll have 10 weeks of work<br>experience which is normally paid um<br>most of our subjects include lab work<br>field trips and so on uh and uh the<br>tuition fees are between sort of 30 to<br>33,000 New Zealand dolls per<br>year and finally um in terms of<br>bachelor's degrees we offer The Bachelor<br>of engineering and this is a 4-year on<br>degree and the reason it's uh a 4-year<br>degree is that it is an accredited<br>program and it's recognized in 21<br>different countries worldwide so you can<br>work in any of those countries as a<br>chartered or registered engineer um upon<br>graduation um and you can see we offer<br>eight different Majors here so you can<br>choose between the different streams<br>depending on what you're interested<br>in there are 800 hours of work<br>experience as part of this program um in<br>years two and three and normally that<br>work experience would be<br>paid so to move on to our master's<br>degrees this is the most popular<br>master's degree that we offer for<br>international students it's the master<br>of business and management the MBM and<br>it's popular for three reasons the first<br>reason is that it can be completed in 12<br>months so you just need to study uh the<br>program for a oneyear period and then<br>you will meet the academic eligibility<br>requirements for the 3year poststudy<br>work visa it's also popular because it<br>includes a guaranteed one month<br>internship so all students um will um be<br>able to work in a company a business in<br>Hamilton or toonga and um get that work<br>experience that you need for your CV um<br>and thirdly it's popular um because you<br>can get direct entry to this program um<br>with a bachelor's degree in any subject<br>so you don't need to have a business<br>background in order to study on the<br>master of business and<br>management you can see it's an intensive<br>program so it has three different parts<br>and each of these parts is normally<br>completed in a 4-week period so you'll<br>be studying throughout the year um<br>across the uh the different um areas of<br>business and management and you can see<br>it covers really a wide range of<br>different areas of business from digital<br>business to um economics to marketing<br>strategic management and so on<br>then we have the master of professional<br>accounting this one is a 14-month<br>program it has intakes in January and<br>November um you can see the total cost<br>is just over $50,000 New Zealand Dollars<br>um this one also gives you provisional<br>membership um of Acca CPA Australia and<br>CA NZ um and with the nine Acca<br>exemptions that I mentioned before the<br>same as The Bachelor of business with<br>the accounting major um this also<br>includes um the possibility of a one-<br>month accounting internship at the end<br>of the program um and this one also<br>doesn't require um uh background in<br>accounting so any bachelor's degree um<br>as long as you get the required grade um<br>would be okay for entry into the master<br>professional<br>accounting and then uh moving away from<br>business we have the master of<br>Information Technology this one is a one<br>to 1.5e program depending on when you<br>start the program um you can see that um<br>it also includes a 10-week compulsory<br>paid internship so um as part of your<br>studies will place you um in an<br>internship setting and you'll get work<br>experience which again is really<br>important for your future um employment<br>and um you can see that the internship<br>is actually paid so you'll be paid<br>$5,500 New Zealand Dollars um for your<br>studies for your work sorry and um then<br>you can see um also that if you have a<br>Computing background you can complete<br>the program in a shorter period of time<br>if you don't have a Computing background<br>you can undertake the postgraduate<br>certificate before you start the master<br>of Information Technology and um then<br>progress onto the program and that's uh<br>can take between one and a half to two<br>years um you can see it's a very<br>flexible program as well so you have the<br>internship as a compulsory component um<br>you have a preparation module and um the<br>industrial technology and Innovation<br>module there as well and then you have a<br>range of elective uh papers that you can<br>take you can choose from a wide range of<br>different areas such as cyber security<br>artificial intelligence uh geographic<br>information systems is a specialism as<br>well um and then finally the master of<br>science so um this is a research<br>master's degree many of the programs uh<br>that I haven't talked about today that<br>we offer our research degrees but this<br>is a good example of one uh you would<br>study You' have some taught study at the<br>start um of the the program and then<br>towards the end of the program um you<br>would write a research dissertation or<br>thesis on an area of your choice um we<br>have access to state-ofthe-art<br>Laboratories um we collaborate um with<br>uh National and international<br>organizations and all of that um<br>contributes to your research and allows<br>you hopefully to uh uh get the degree<br>that you're looking for which should<br>lead into the career um that you're<br>hoping to uh to<br>achieve uh and again you can see the<br>different Majors that are available in<br>the master of science uh the programs<br>with the Stars next to them they<br>actually have um uh an option of a<br>research project in collaboration with<br>an industry partner so again looking at<br>employability looking at future plans<br>so um we also offer PhD study I won't go<br>into too much detail here um but um PhD<br>study is very popular in New Zealand and<br>the reason is that International<br>students pay domestic fees so there is a<br>huge amount of interest in PhD study in<br>New Zealand because the cost is so low<br>um which means that it's very very<br>competitive to get a PhD place we have<br>three uh application points per year so<br>that's uh the end of January the end of<br>May and the end of September<br>and um we then assess applications after<br>that point and we provide the results 2<br>months later you don't need to find a<br>supervisor before you apply we will send<br>all applications um that meet our<br>requirements off to the relevant<br>departments and they will assess them uh<br>they have a panel who meets to look at<br>the uh uh PhD uh applications and<br>proposals and uh they decide um who to<br>offer places to and they will be able to<br>find you a supervisor um if your<br>application does meet our requirements<br>and we do have the expertise to<br>supervise<br>you for students who don't meet our<br>entry requirements um then you can study<br>at the University of w cutle college so<br>this offers English language study<br>Foundation study um we have an<br>international first year for students<br>who don't quite meet our requirements to<br>uh start the uh the normal first year<br>year um International first year<br>students will still progress normally<br>into the second year of a bachelor's<br>degree though and then we offer um a um<br>pre-masters program that allows students<br>to enter into a master's degree upon<br>completion so um it's a very nurturing<br>very friendly place um in which to study<br>we have really good support um for<br>students who are studying at the college<br>there's a great opportunity to mix with<br>dom domestic students and also to use<br>all of the University's facilities such<br>as the library and uh so<br>on we offer a range of scholarships uh<br>as well that um will help you to um uh<br>help you with the fees for your studies<br>and uh you can see in this table a list<br>of all of the scholarships that we offer<br>the two scholarships at the top these<br>are um scholarships we're offering<br>because of covid-19 and they're actually<br>more fee reductions so for students Who<br>start their studies this year um they<br>are eligible for a 20% discount for<br>online students that's a 20% discount<br>for all online study um for students who<br>are onshore in New Zealand that's a 20%<br>discount for the first 120 points of<br>onshore study so that's automatically<br>applied at the moment to all students<br>that are starting with<br>us when our borders reopen um then we<br>will start to um uh offer the uh other<br>scholarships um to students who are<br>overseas um but at the moment um the<br>other scholarships listed here are only<br>offered to students who are onshore in<br>New Zealand so we have the international<br>Excellence scholarship which is a fee<br>reduction of up to 20,000 New Zealand<br>dollars that is based on academic Merit<br>then we have the um International<br>entrance scholarship and that's for<br>students who are um leaving school in<br>New Zealand and again um that's up to<br>$110,000 as a tuition fee reduction but<br>further um uh tuition fee reductions in<br>year 2 and year three which can amount<br>to up to $220,000 in<br>total we have um a scholarship for our<br>foundation and uh diploma programs um<br>and um there are various scholarship um<br>scholarships available there um<br>depending on academic achievement but<br>also Financial need um we have the<br>International High achievements<br>scholarship which is for current<br>students um who are getting high grades<br>in their studies um so you would need a<br>B+ average and you'd automatically get<br>a$ 5,000 New Zealand doll tuition fee<br>reduction and we also offer some full<br>scholarships for PhD study so these are<br>really exceptional students who have<br>achieved very high grades in their<br>studies and whose research interests<br>expertise um just before I move on I<br>should briefly talk about our entry<br>requirements um so we require iots of<br>six for bachelor's degree iots of 6.5<br>for master's degree and um for um entry<br>to uh bachelor's degree level study it<br>really depends on your um country and<br>your your previous studies at high<br>school um and so on for master's degree<br>we normally require the equivalent of a<br>b-grade average or B minus grade average<br>in the news Zealand system in order to<br>progress so finally to talk about our<br>Halls of residents we have catered and<br>self-catered Halls um as I've said<br>they're both on campus cat Halls include<br>food all food breakfast lunch and dinner<br>are provided you'd always have a private<br>bedroom um in the cater hols you would<br>share a bathroom and normally a living<br>area as well and the cat hols are really<br>good for undergraduate students new<br>bachelor's degree students and for those<br>who Maybe want a bit more of an easy<br>life who who don't want to cook their<br>own food then we have self-c halls and<br>these are popular with International<br>students particularly mature students um<br>again you'd have a private bedroom um<br>and you would sometimes share a bathroom<br>we do have some uh options with private<br>bathroom as well um you'd also share a<br>living area and a kitchen and you can<br>see the costs here so um it kind of<br>varies depending on the Hall of<br>residence that you choose but you can<br>see the cost per week obviously quite a<br>bit higher for the cat Halls because<br>bills so thank you very much for<br>listening to
