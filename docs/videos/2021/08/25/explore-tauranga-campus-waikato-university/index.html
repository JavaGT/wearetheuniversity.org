the<br>scholarships you may wish to apply for<br>and also touch on the student services<br>so<br>our talinga campus is based in the<br>beautiful bay of plenty region it's<br>about an hour and a half from our main<br>campus in hamilton and about two and a<br>half hours from the thriving metropolis<br>of auckland<br>but who needs auckland when you can get<br>your degree by the sea in

all<br>undergraduate degree programs so that<br>marries up the theory that you're<br>learning in classes<br>with some<br>practical skills in a workplace<br>environment so you really build on those<br>soft skills to make you highly<br>employable when you've completed your<br>degree<br>we have flexible degree structures<br>friendly campuses smaller class sizes so<br>you get more one-on-one
