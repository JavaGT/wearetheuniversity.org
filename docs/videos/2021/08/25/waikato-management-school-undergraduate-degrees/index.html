In terms of quality of teaching and  <br>research and we have been accredited <br>by all three of those organizations  <br>we're also ranked number one in New Zealand in <br>subjects of business and economics and nine of  <br>the country's top economists are teaching and <br>researching in the Waikato Management School.  <br>Our public relations program is the only <br>one in Oceania certified by the public  <br>relations society of America and we're globally <br>recognised for our chartered accountancy program.<br>We have four undergraduate degree options <br>available the Bachelor of Management Studies  <br>with honours which is a four-year degree. The <br>Bachelor of Business is a three-year degree.  <br>As is the Bachelor of Climate <br>Change which is new in 2022,  <br>and the Bachelor of Communication. I'm going to <br>tell you a little bit more about each of these  <br>first of all just to show you a little bit <br>about the example of the degree structure  <br>at the University of Waikato and you'll see <br>just to help you explain understand some of  <br>the things that I'll talk about later our degrees <br>are described in terms of years number of years  <br>for study each year is equivalent to 120 points so <br>in a typical year you'll do eight 15 point papers  <br>so uh you'll see that in your first year <br>of study you'll do 100 level papers in your  <br>second year 200 level um and in your third year <br>a combination of 300 level and 200 level papers.<br>We'll talk a little bit more about <br>majors and electives as we go along<br>So the Bachelor of Management Studies <br>with Honours, this is a four-year degree  <br>and we've offered this qualification since 1972. <br>In 2022 the Waikato Management School will be  <br>celebrating our 50th birthday so we're young <br>by international standards in terms of business  <br>schools and that's what part of the magic of <br>the place that makes us so adaptive and agile  <br>but this qualification has been our <br>flagship program throughout that time  <br>and we've continued to improve it and <br>change it to meet the needs of industry  <br>in this program you'll do two work integrative <br>learning papers we pride ourselves on the quality  <br>of the papers that we offer that integrate <br>students learning with industry needs and  <br>potential employment outcomes following on from <br>study and in the third and fourth years you do  <br>postgraduate level study and general management <br>papers for the bachelor of management studies  <br>with honours and for the bachelor of business we <br>have 10 major subjects and you'll see those there  <br>accounting digital business economics finance <br>human resource management marketing public  <br>relations strategic management supply chain <br>management and tourism and hospitality management<br>So this is the typical structure of the <br>bachelor of management studies with honours  <br>you'll see that the yellow boxes show where <br>the major subject sits for a single major  <br>the grey boxes show the call papers for <br>the program and the blue boxes show where  <br>you can fit elective or minor papers <br>equally you can do a double major the  <br>gold yellow boxes show where your first major will <br>go and the lighter colour yellow boxes show where  <br>your second major would go so your second major <br>can be any of those 10 subjects I listed before  <br>or in fact can be from any subject offered by the <br>University of Waikato and when you hear from our  <br>student speaker later on you'll hear what she's <br>done to combine two majors within her degree.<br>Here's an example of a single <br>major in digital business  <br>you'll see that in the first year of study you do <br>digi 101 the world of digital business and ingest  <br>101 digital business and supply chain management <br>you also do four of our business fundamentals  <br>and you'll see the five listed down below mgsis101 <br>is already one of the fundamentals so you do four  <br>more from accounting economics finance marketing <br>and strategic management and then you've got room  <br>for two electives um you might want to do a minor <br>in another subject or as i mentioned before you've  <br>got room to do a second major as you move through <br>the digital business major in the second third  <br>and fourth year of the program you'll see that <br>the papers get quite interesting and specific in  <br>terms of what they're delivering and in the gray <br>boxes you'll see the core papers for the degree  <br>what's special about this program is <br>that in your third and fourth year  <br>you're doing 500 levels so graduate level <br>papers in management general management skills  <br>soft skills communication skills leadership <br>skills there's data papers in there there's global  <br>business practice papers and that's where we also <br>fit in the second work integrated learning paper.<br>Our bachelor of business is a three-year <br>degree and again in the same 10 majors we  <br>offer four of those majors over in our <br>Tauranga campus so accounting finance  <br>marketing and strategic management can all <br>be taken in our Tauranga campus and it's  <br>that top right photo there is of our uh <br>wonderful building in the CBD in Tauranga  <br>and a number of our papers can also <br>be studied at a distance and online  <br>again here's the structure for the single <br>major for the bachelor of business so a typical  <br>three-year degree um gold papers indicating <br>your first major again the core papers are  <br>similar to the bachelor of management studies the <br>business fundamentals at a second-year you do a  <br>data analytics paper an intercultural perspectives <br>paper very pleased with these papers and what they  <br>add to a student's program and their employability <br>beyond study and a work-integrated learning paper<br>the double major again you've got the room <br>as you see for a first major and one of  <br>those 10 subjects and a second major and <br>one of those 10 subjects or anything else  <br>offered by the university could be science <br>uh it could be social sciences could be arts  <br>could be Maori and indigenous <br>studies lots of options  <br>here's an example of the bachelor of business <br>and finance if you've done a lot of maths at  <br>secondary school you won't need to do preparatory <br>maths but if you come to us without a strong maths  <br>background you can still start your finance major <br>um with a prep maths paper to support your study  <br>you'll see as you move up again through this <br>through the years the papers get quite interesting  <br>entrepreneurial finance investments and you'll <br>see the core papers in the middle there again<br>I mentioned accounting and our recognition by <br>the other accreditation agencies so cairns CPA  <br>Australia and ACCA are the New Zealand Australian <br>American associations that are credit chartered  <br>accountants and students who take the bachelor <br>of business or management with this particular  <br>grouping of papers you'll see that there are more <br>gold papers in here than normal so for accounting  <br>for chartered accountancy purposes if you add <br>another four papers you meet the requirements  <br>to go on to to be assessed <br>to be a chatted accountant<br>Bachelor of Communication so there's another <br>session available for you to view from  <br>my colleague Fabrice where he gets into more <br>detail about the bachelor of communication  <br>but it's a three-year degree that we offer <br>has five majors applied digital communication  <br>creative media marketing media production <br>and public relations, uh you'll see a  <br>photo there of the right honourable Jacinda <br>Ardern our Prime Minister who is, in fact,  <br>a graduate of the bachelor of communication <br>at Waikato so we're very proud of that.<br>Again the structure you'll see here in the <br>grey boxes the uh the difference in the core  <br>papers for the bachelor of communication so <br>in your first year you're doing fundamental  <br>skills for media and creative industries <br>communication competencies digital world  <br>and communication and organizing and then again <br>communication ethics intercultural perspectives  <br>and a work-integrated learning paper make up <br>the core of the degree again the major can be  <br>in the first major will be in one of those five <br>subjects and the second major can be in one of  <br>those or any other subject offered by Waikato <br>management school or the university so you  <br>could do a first major in public relations and a <br>second major in strategic management for example<br>and again the structure for a double major<br>here's an example of the bachelor communication <br>and marketing so in your first year you do two  <br>marketing papers uh fundamentals of successful <br>marketing and principles of consumer behaviour  <br>and research you'll see in the second year <br>there's some interesting papers there and in  <br>your third year you get to choose from <br>number of papers to make up your major<br>bachelor of climate change so you might see <br>other presentations available about this degree  <br>we're very excited about it and it's new on <br>offer in 2022 be part of the climate solution  <br>so wakara management school is very pleased to <br>be part of this whole of university qualification  <br>with three majors offered economics <br>public relations and strategic management  <br>and we're all also contributing to the core <br>of the degree through an economics paper  <br>so this just shows you briefly the three majors <br>we have for waikato management school for the  <br>bachelor climate change so this is the economics <br>degree economics major again you'll see in the  <br>gray boxes the different core for bachelor of <br>climate change which is looking really exciting  <br>critical social science research <br>the crisis of climate change  <br>introduction to climate change science arts <br>activism in a changing environment an introduction  <br>to maori pacific and indigenous students <br>indigenous studies the climate change crisis  <br>and then moving on again to um interesting <br>papers in the second and third year<br>public relations uh obviously a key component <br>of successful business endeavors into making  <br>a difference in climate change and strategic <br>management how do we organize how do we organize  <br>ourselves in our business to be at the forefront <br>of what's needed to adapt to a changing world<br>i just want to talk a little bit about conjoint <br>degree programs we get a lot of questions about  <br>conjunct degree programs obviously as i've <br>mentioned in all of our degrees you can do  <br>a double major so that's one way to combine <br>two different things but equally you can do  <br>two separate bachelor's degrees at the same <br>time and by way of a conjoint degree program  <br>if you do it formally as a conjunct degree program <br>you get a little bit more credit between the two  <br>transfer of credit between the two degrees so <br>you get to complete two degrees in a shorter  <br>amount of time than you would if you studied <br>them separately and i'll show you what that  <br>looks like in some degree plans shortly we know <br>that employers are increasingly on the lookout  <br>for well-rounded graduates with strengths in <br>more than one area we've got some fantastic  <br>examples of graduates who from conjoint programs <br>have gone on to some really interesting careers  <br>so studying two different things simultaneously <br>develop you develop skills that are transferable  <br>across disciplines and we have conduit programs <br>available in all of our undergraduate programs<br>so here's an example of the bachelor of <br>business uh combined with a bachelor of arts  <br>so i mentioned points before in a typical one year <br>you would do 120 points so a bachelor of business  <br>is 360 points three years and the bachelor <br>of arts is 360 points three years so if you  <br>did them both separately that would take you six <br>years 720 points by doing a conjoint you you get  <br>some some credit and so you are able to complete <br>it in 510 points so just over four years of study  <br>you'll see in the gold on the left your bachelor <br>of business major in the blue the fundamental  <br>papers that we require for a bachelor of business <br>on the right you'll see the beige colored bachelor  <br>of arts major and in the grey the the fundamental <br>papers are required for a bachelor of arts  <br>so you get to do all of the the key components <br>of both degrees um along the way so a bachelor  <br>of arts major you might want to take history you <br>might want to take a language and culture major  <br>philosophy lots of opportunities to combine <br>really exciting things with a business major  <br>here's another example of the um basically <br>the same structure same number of points  <br>but the bachelor of business with the bachelor <br>of science science so that could be a major  <br>in psychology a major in molecular and cellular <br>biology major in computer science again combining  <br>two different facets that are going to <br>be really really important for getting  <br>out there and getting that exciting job <br>that satisfies what you're interested in  <br>here's a combination of a three-year degree with <br>a four-year degree so this starts to look a little  <br>bit challenging but um but it's again um shorter <br>than if you did the two degrees uh one after the  <br>other uh so here's the bachelor of laws or <br>bachelor of laws honours with the bachelor  <br>of communication it could be a really exciting <br>combination um and you'll see there that you  <br>complete all of everything that's required for law  <br>and you still get to fit in everything that's <br>important in the bachelor of communication<br>here's uh don't want to don't want to frighten <br>you off but he's an even bigger program which is  <br>two four year degrees the bachelor of management <br>studies with honours and the llb or llb honours  <br>so um you know if you were doing these two things <br>end on that would take you eight years and as a  <br>conjoint you get them done and less than that just <br>over seven years remembering too that just because  <br>you might start this program study in semester one <br>of your first year doesn't mean you're locked in  <br>there's lots of opportunities to change your mind <br>if you find that you want to go in a slightly  <br>different direction but all good things to think <br>about as you as you're beginning your journey so  <br>now we're going to hear a student perspective and <br>we're going to hear from mackenzie as i mentioned  <br>mckenzie is one of our third year students and <br>she's going to tell us about her journey so far  <br>kyoto my name is mackenzie northcott and i'm a <br>third year student at the university of waikato  <br>management school when i am not off playing <br>netball or running around the dance studio with  <br>my students i study a bachelor of management <br>studies with honours doing a double major in  <br>professional accounting and sport development and <br>coaching did you know that here in the management  <br>school you can take a major subjects that <br>aren't directly related to the management skill  <br>well guess what it's the best part yet not only <br>are you completing your business degree you get to  <br>be a part of papers in which you're passionate <br>about i chose sport development and coaching  <br>because i'm a super active person and love a good <br>practical paper to balance out my accounting ones  <br>i am originally from poconos south auckland where <br>i attended pocono primary school before moving to  <br>a small high school called acg strathallen for my <br>high school years here i was fortunate enough to  <br>be head girl captain of my premier nipple team <br>and gained my public speaking skills to present  <br>in front of you today in 2018 i embarked on <br>my journey here at the university of wakato  <br>and a few years down the track it is an honor to <br>share my experience with all of you guys today  <br>my first interaction with the university of <br>wakatau was when i was a kid following my mum  <br>around the campus she was studying a bachelor of <br>teaching on the hamilton campus and i at the time  <br>had a dream of becoming a physio the funny thing <br>was at the time and to this day is that i don't  <br>like the look of blood nor broken bones so <br>quite frankly becoming a physio was clearly  <br>not an option however it was with my mum at <br>this time spending time around the campus  <br>that made me realise that i was going to come here <br>and study when i grew up this became my dream the  <br>beautiful fields amazing lecturers awesome gym <br>and i'm in the library wow not sure if it was  <br>the resources that i was most attracted to at the <br>time or the hide and seek places my brother and i  <br>found in the library but anywho here we are today <br>and i'm absolutely loving my uni life experience  <br>i chose the university of wakatau not just <br>because of the awesome side and seek places  <br>but also because it was close to home which was <br>important to me i also chose wakato over auckland  <br>due to the beautiful whanau like campus and to <br>avoid sitting in traffic all the time of course  <br>living on facilities on campus as well as <br>surrounding fleeting streets make getting to  <br>uni easy as as well as making the most amazing <br>friends along the way i am fortunate enough to  <br>be surrounded by the most amazing friends <br>who i met in my first year at college hall  <br>college hall was by far a life-changing experience <br>from the countless movie-watching evenings  <br>kings cup bosses and the late evening maccas <br>trips my friends and i started our journey  <br>together mates that i continue to live with <br>today and cherish our memories endlessly  <br>had i had not come to the university of waukesha <br>these mates would not be in my life today  <br>my nana once told me if you have a dream there <br>are always ways to make it happen for me my one  <br>dream is to one day become a chartered accountant <br>and travel the world therefore to make the stream  <br>a reality i need to study hard pass those threated <br>exams learn to drink coffee because quite frankly  <br>you need it have fun and most importantly make <br>the most of every opportunity that comes your way  <br>through the last three years i've had <br>made the most of every opportunity  <br>last year i became an ambassador for the wakator <br>management school treasurer of abeda alpha psi  <br>vice president for the wakator management <br>school student association and became a 100  <br>level accounting tutor not only have i loved every <br>minute of these extracurricular activities i have  <br>created relationships and formed connections <br>with financial employees for the near future  <br>fortunately through the internship program that <br>is offered here at the waukesha management school  <br>i have now gained two internships at the price <br>waterhouse cooper also known as pwc pwc has  <br>provided me with invaluable learning opportunities <br>putting my university studies into action  <br>as well as providing the stepping stone into the <br>real world after my university days come to an end  <br>for me the university of wakatau took all of my <br>boxes and i couldn't think of a better place to  <br>spend my time at university my final message <br>for you all comes from michelle obama the only  <br>limit to the height of your achievements is <br>the reach of your dreams and your willingness  <br>to work hard for them so my challenge to you <br>all dream vague and make that dream a reality
