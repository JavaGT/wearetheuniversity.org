mathematical<br>sciences in this video you will meet<br>four people who teach at our school<br>they will tell you about the degrees in<br>which you can enroll<br>we also have some videos of students in<br>which they tell you about their studies<br>hi i'm dave nichols and i'm going to<br>briefly talk through our computer<br>science degrees<br>and start with we have our bachelor of<br>computer science<br>this is a new degree this year and it's<br>been designed with an industry focus<br>so there's a lot of breadth and depth<br>and lots of programming that's what we<br>do in computer science we build new<br>digital things and in this degree you'll<br>get a lot of experience of building<br>digital things in different contexts so<br>whether that's the web mobile internet<br>of things artificial intelligence<br>networking a whole collection of<br>core technologies<br>in computer science<br>and this degree also contains a kind of<br>balance so we have some elements of<br>business and user experience so that the<br>things that we build actually are useful<br>to people in the real world<br>this degree has two variations called<br>specified programs<br>one called embedded systems and that is<br>programming in the context of more<br>hardware<br>and<br>data analytics which is programming in<br>so in addition to that three-year<br>program we also have a four-year bcms<br>honours<br>and<br>bsc can be<br>for three years and these two degrees<br>are different to the bachelor of<br>computer science in that they allow you<br>to take a double major<br>so you can mix computer science with<br>another full subject so that could be<br>something like mathematics or design or<br>indeed anything from the rest of the<br>university<br>the bcms honours is capped with a large<br>research project and that's really what<br>and we also teach at a master's level we<br>have a master information technology<br>which has a strong business connection<br>and a specialist cyber security masters<br>so here are some of our students to talk<br>about their experiences<br>hi<br>my name is rowan simmons i studied at<br>the university of waikato in 2014<br>now my research involves looking at the<br>internet of things or iot<br>is i get to play with toys all day<br>and<br>but now i'm living in hamilton currently<br>i'm a maori student at the university of<br>waikato<br>and i wanted towards a christian<br>computer science<br>focal point of my research is how best<br>to apply capability in a computer<br>science context<br>i chose to study at the university of<br>waikato because of my passion for<br>software development<br>and decided to pursue a master's of<br>science<br>degree<br>after i graduated and i enjoyed the<br>campus atmosphere so much i<br>challenged myself further by<br>contributing research<br>within the computer science discipline<br>now the highlights for me while studying<br>at the university of waikato has been<br>the opportunity to apply my skills<br>such as mentoring students<br>um and assisting tutors and computer<br>papers<br>which i find that very rewarding helping<br>others another highlight is the support<br>systems available to students at all<br>levels of study<br>being modern myself i'm thankful for the<br>support<br>i've received and urged future students<br>to take full advantage<br>so if you're thinking of studying<br>whatever the level or discipline the<br>community at the university of waikato<br>is a study place to be<br>i'm dr claire timpani from the<br>department of design at the university<br>for the creative thinkers and the<br>problem solvers this is the degree for<br>you<br>the bachelor of design is a three-year<br>degree with four different majors<br>interface for the students who want to<br>create websites mobile apps and the<br>future of interaction<br>communication<br>more than logos print and advertising<br>this major provides you the skills to be<br>a modern graphic designer<br>media where wellywood meets hollywood<br>you will design moving and media<br>experiences for new audiences<br>industrial<br>embracing three-dimensional product<br>design so you can solve everyday<br>problems in our fast-paced new world<br>each of the majors can work on their own<br>or you can combine any two of them<br>we would love you to join us for design<br>at waikato<br>and now<br>here are two of our successful design<br>students<br>how to everybody my name is hazel and<br>i'm a master's student here at the<br>university of waikato i studied my<br>undergraduate here too in a bachelor of<br>design which i majored in communication<br>design and media design<br>during that time i was able to do some<br>pretty awesome projects here for my<br>degree project i<br>made a app designed for plant-based<br>athletes to maintain their dietary<br>requirements throughout their training<br>after graduation i was lucky enough to<br>receive a summer research scholarship<br>which was an awesome opportunity it gave<br>me the opportunity to work with the<br>indigenous<br>studies department here at the<br>university of waikato which was awesome<br>because i was able to<br>experience a lot of different culture<br>which i had never experienced before<br>during this time i helped create a<br>fijian cultural app which is then going<br>to be released into fiji which is pretty<br>awesome um<br>yeah so if you want to try out that<br>stuff come to our castle<br>i am now completing my masters of design<br>so for that i am looking at doing my<br>thesis on vr which is pretty cool<br>there's a lot of awesome tools you get<br>to play with here at wakato and you get<br>some really awesome opportunities so<br>come to waikato choose waikato you won't<br>regret it<br>hey guys my name is benedict i am a<br>bachelor of design student here at<br>waikato majoring in communication design<br>and minoring in media design<br>so throughout the course of three years<br>of my study here at waikato i have<br>created projects such as the postcards<br>so as you can see over here it might<br>have been sent to your school<br>and i've also done posters for my other<br>classes with this one it talks about the<br>turtles and how we can save them and<br>this one is for a media class that i<br>created a poster for it saying that the<br>children are featured so we should<br>follow them<br>i have also created an app for my<br>internship for gelhertz so for keller i<br>entered for them for 12 weeks and they<br>have asked me to create a virtual app<br>for the system that they were preparing<br>to do so if you want this great<br>experience definitely come here at white<br>council<br>hi i'm daniel from the mathematics<br>department in new zealand today<br>mathematics is very much an enabling<br>science for example it's used in<br>modeling<br>climate forecasting<br>the financial sector scientific<br>consultancy you name it every company<br>needs either a mathematician or a<br>statistician<br>there are two different ways you can<br>take mathematics here at waikato you can<br>either do the bachelor of science degree<br>or instead you can take the bachelor of<br>computing in mathematical sciences<br>we have two main degree programs<br>the first is mathematics itself whilst<br>the second is data analytics which has a<br>more statistical flavor<br>our department is one of the top ranked<br>departments in the country and we look<br>forward to seeing you here in waikato in<br>2022<br>let's hear from a couple of our students<br>laura and dale<br>hi my name is laura and i'm in my<br>founding year of maths at the university<br>of waikato i think maths is such a cool<br>subject because it has so many<br>applications from compsci to finance to<br>in my case biomass<br>i've always wanted to help people in my<br>job and i considered becoming a doctor<br>that's why after i graduate i plan to<br>work in the field of mathematical<br>medicine<br>so many areas from cancer modeling all<br>the way through to computational<br>neuroscience use maths<br>actually at the moment i'm researching<br>how electrical stimulation of the brain<br>causes your muscles to move<br>hopefully my research will help people<br>who have had strokes<br>i'm so excited for my future and i love<br>studying maths here at waikato my name's<br>dale i graduated from waikato with a<br>major in data analytics and i'm now a<br>data scientist for city transportation<br>at the hamilton city council<br>my role is to enable council to make<br>more informed decisions and transport<br>projects by transforming data into<br>insights as well as making it more<br>accessible to the community<br>what i love about my work is making a<br>real difference to my city through the<br>use of data<br>from prediction models of car trips to<br>classifying different modes of transport<br>for seeing the impact of our projects<br>the data analytics major at waikato gave<br>me the skills and techniques for making<br>sense of the vast amounts of data we<br>have at council and helped prepare me<br>for my career and data science hi<br>i'm panus i'm a professional software<br>engineer and a senior lecturer with the<br>department of software engineering here<br>at the university of waikato<br>software is everywhere<br>it's in your phones<br>it's on the cloud it's in aircraft<br>internet of things and a number of other<br>smart and embedded devices<br>however<br>it's not as straightforward to make it<br>good you have to make it correctly you<br>have to ensure that it's safe secure and<br>performance and in order to do this you<br>require good education<br>our four-year bachelor of engineering in<br>software engineering is an elite<br>qualification<br>it will make you a charter software<br>engineer and an expert in software and<br>computer systems<br>it will fully prepare you for a<br>software career<br>you'll learn how to design and develop<br>large and complex software intensive<br>projects and you will eventually oversee<br>them and ensure their quality<br>perhaps you also rise to the level of a<br>technical project manager or you can<br>form your own startup<br>our bachelor of engineering in software<br>engineering is accredited by engineering<br>new zealand and it's also supported by<br>its technical interest group the tira<br>hangaroo i.t engineers<br>i must trust this this is an<br>international recognition through<br>washington accord this will allow you to<br>work as a chartered engineer throughout<br>the globe<br>in our degree you will also participate<br>in numerous internships which will<br>enable you to acquire real working<br>experience with many of our industrial<br>partners<br>it also unlocks graduate<br>master's and phd degrees as were<br>described earlier in the computer<br>science section<br>you'll now hear from two of our recent<br>graduates and i'm looking forward to<br>seeing you at the university of waikato<br>hey everyone<br>i'm rhys compton i studied a bachelor's<br>of engineering majoring in software<br>engineering at the university of waikato<br>i graduated in december 2019 and ever<br>since then i've been working at rosia<br>systems which is a great agri-tech<br>when i started there i came on as a<br>research intern doing a project around<br>since then i've been working as a<br>software engineer on a range of other<br>projects and the agricultural and<br>horticultural sector<br>after i get a uni i also published a<br>paper in an international conference<br>and i've also been the awardee of a<br>fulbright scholarship which means i'll<br>be traveling to the states in 2021 to do<br>my master's in computer science at new<br>york university hi my name is dylan<br>exton i'm a graduate software engineer<br>from the university of waikato<br>and i'm now working as a research<br>programmer in the hakatori group within<br>the university<br>my current work involves me creating<br>specialized hardware<br>which will then be<br>introduced into a wearable such as the<br>shirt<br>for forestry workers out in the field<br>with the overall goal of reducing the<br>number of incidents<br>that occur in forests in new zealand<br>this project started as my honours<br>project as a proof of concept that this<br>could work this is now developed into my<br>work as a research programmer where i'm<br>developing this<br>hardware and the software behind it and<br>then testing it on myself to ensure that<br>it works under the conditions we needed<br>to<br>i'll be continuing this project on into<br>my masters where we will test this on<br>actual forestry workers in the field<br>to ensure that this could be a viable<br>option for the future thank you for<br>listening to our video<br>if you want to learn more about the<br>school and the different degrees please<br>have a look at our website<br>and we now show you some short videos of<br>our staff members who talk about the<br>research that they do i ensure that<br>safety critical systems such as medical<br>devices and avionics work as expected i<br>engineer systems to work with ramadi and<br>tukang ahmadi<br>i investigate maori sovereignty of maori<br>data while researching maori specific<br>software engineering methodologies<br>because we work closely with businesses<br>even if the students are at university<br>they may get the opportunity to work<br>with a company to develop an i.t<br>solution that solves a real-world<br>problem maths physics and supercomputers<br>to develop models that help us<br>understand<br>the interaction between the sun and the<br>interstellar<br>i investigate visual design and user<br>experience solutions to information<br>seeking and information use problems<br>i use these findings to design better<br>ways to visualize and present<br>information to people in mobile and<br>on-the-go situations<br>i worked in cyber security where i<br>design and evaluate anomaly detection<br>tools to secure our software<br>applications and networks from malicious<br>turbulences everywhere you can find it<br>in the rivers and the sea and the ocean<br>in the air and even in space and that's<br>what i study here everyone my name is<br>paul and the data analysis that i do can<br>be used to help predict the outcomes of<br>elections i investigate how systems<br>manage themselves automatically and i<br>oversee the design and architecture of<br>novel cloud applications and tools in<br>conjunction with local and international<br>industrial i work on software<br>verification which allows us to prove<br>mathematically that our software is safe<br>and secure when we design a book a<br>website a chair or a movie<br>we make our world more enjoyable and<br>beautiful<br>designing we make people's lives better<br>i work on bayesian methods bayesian<br>methods can be used for modeling complex<br>events such as pandemics stock markets<br>lost aircraft i do research into novel<br>interfaces that let you find and manage<br>digital content whatever form that might<br>be in<br>want to find a song but don't know its<br>name then maybe you want to try my query<br>by humming interface i research safety<br>critical systems and how we can ensure<br>they work as expected using model based<br>testing and model checking the aim of<br>information visualization<br>is to present information in such a way<br>that we're able to extract the relevant<br>features for a given context and perhaps<br>gain insight that would not have been<br>possible without that particular<br>visualization i'm a cosmologist i study<br>things like the big bang black holes and<br>sustainable design focuses on the<br>development of products both tangible<br>and virtual such as services or digital<br>artifacts<br>it looks after all aspects that support<br>human life from the efficient use of<br>resources to the protection of the<br>environment and the society as a whole<br>data stream mining<br>making sure your machine learning models<br>stay relevant and accurate<br>while the world changes<br>which it always does<br>my research teaches computers to learn<br>from data so they can better manage the<br>world i research how software intensive<br>systems should be designed to assure<br>people's safety in high risk working<br>environments via automated detection<br>the great english mathematician alan<br>turing<br>managed to work out a test to see if a<br>machine was intelligent<br>and he did this even before there were<br>digital computers<br>his idea was that an intelligent machine<br>could answer questions in a way that was<br>indistinguishable from the way people<br>answer questions<br>i'm interested in machines that can<br>answer questions<br>but even more<br>i'm interested in machines that can ask<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
