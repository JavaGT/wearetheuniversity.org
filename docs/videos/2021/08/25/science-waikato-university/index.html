the<br>university of waikato i'm margaret<br>barber the dean of science thank you for<br>joining me on this virtual open day<br>i'd like to give you some information on<br>our school and hopefully<br>help you decide to come and study<br>first let's talk a little bit about what<br>science is<br>and who is a scientist<br>so science is really just a systematic<br>study of the structure and behavior of<br>the physical world and the natural world<br>through observation and experiment<br>so you might remember when you were a<br>kid asking questions about how the world<br>worked and why things were the way they<br>were<br>so science is just putting a structure<br>around that curiosity so really science<br>is for everyone<br>so a lot of people have the<br>stereotypical view of what a scientist<br>is maybe they're wearing a white lab<br>coat and safety glasses and they're in a<br>laboratory with chemicals and scientific<br>equipment but scientists are so much<br>more than that<br>some of our scientists work out in the<br>beautiful forest<br>understanding the way<br>these forest systems work and all the<br>other living beings within our forests<br>some of our forests work in the most<br>some of<br>some of our scientists work in the most<br>extreme environments in the world and<br>here we have scientists working in<br>antarctica in the dry valleys studying<br>the<br>climate systems of antarctica<br>we also have scientists who work in<br>caves underground and they're using<br>stalactites and celectites to understand<br>the past climate of the world which is<br>recorded in in the structures within<br>caves<br>or<br>we have scientists that study the ocean<br>who love being out on the ocean and want<br>to understand how the marine systems<br>work<br>or<br>they dive underneath the surface of the<br>ocean and look at life<br>and the biophysical processes underneath<br>the surface<br>so you can see that science is for<br>everyone<br>certainly for all these people here so<br>these are our students<br>on a field trip<br>on the tongariro crossing and you can<br>see how happy they are to be in such a<br>beautiful environment<br>studying this environment and<br>understanding how the system works<br>you might think what is science done for<br>me lately well i'll give you a couple<br>really good examples of where science is<br>really really important in the world<br>today and the first is the obvious one<br>the pandemic so this has created huge<br>change in huge upheaval all around the<br>world<br>in new zealand we're particularly lucky<br>that our decision-making around the<br>pandemic was driven by science and<br>scientific evidence and so here are<br>seven examples of scientists from new<br>zealand who contributed to the new<br>zealand response to the pandemic<br>through their scientific expertise and<br>this has meant that new zealand has been<br>almost completely untouched by the temp<br>pandemic except that our borders have<br>been closed for a little while<br>we are lucky that we have scientists<br>such as these seven people in<br>in new zealand to help us through the<br>the pandemic<br>but in sort of a more longer term issue<br>is climate change<br>and<br>science has an awful lot to offer<br>as we study the earth's climate systems<br>as we try to come up with solutions to<br>this<br>long-term problem of<br>so you could be a scientist<br>and we can talk about the different<br>subjects that you could study as a<br>scientist here at the university of<br>waikato<br>so we have a bunch of subjects and we<br>call them majors<br>that fall within the very broad<br>discipline of science<br>so aquaculture and chemistry earth<br>sciences ecology and biodiversity<br>environmental sciences materials<br>sciences cellular and molecular biology<br>and psychology these are all different<br>disciplines of science that you can<br>study here at the university<br>and then complementing these majors<br>these big<br>scientific subjects<br>are minors so these are smaller<br>groupings of subjects papers to make up<br>subjects and from the list above we also<br>add animal behaviour and biochemistry<br>coastal processes<br>and geology and hydrology but also soil<br>science so you've got a really wide<br>range of different subjects to study<br>um within the bachelor of science so you<br>would choose the right combination that<br>best prepares you for what you want to<br>do in your career after your<br>science science degree<br>so<br>some of these subjects are only<br>available in hamilton and our on our<br>campus in hamilton but aquaculture is<br>available only on our campus in toldona<br>and this is because we can take<br>advantage of the proximity of the<br>beautiful marine<br>ecosystems near tauranga for our<br>students to get really in the<br>environment and really understand how it<br>works so aquaculture is available only<br>in tauranga but you can study<br>environmental sciences both on our<br>hamilton campus and our told on our<br>campus<br>and that's because environmental<br>sciences and aquaculture fit really<br>nicely together and a nice complement<br>so at the university we think it's<br>really important that you<br>transition from studying into the<br>workforce really easily and we provide<br>you with a range of options to help you<br>start your career as a scientist so one<br>of these options is a capstone project<br>this is in your third year for the final<br>year of your degree where you'll work<br>with a group of students on a<br>on a project you'll be developing<br>teamwork skills and communication skills<br>and also problem solving skills in this<br>group<br>so that's one option<br>another option is an undergraduate<br>research project so if you are pretty<br>sure that you want to be a research<br>scientist this is a great option for you<br>in your third year as an undergraduate<br>student to do some real research this is<br>authentic research project so um<br>creating new understanding and new<br>knowledge of our systems<br>and this gives you a little taster of<br>what it's like to be a research<br>scientist<br>before you commit to a postgraduate<br>qualification<br>in scientific research<br>and then if you are pretty sure that you<br>want to start being a scientist in a lab<br>or in the field straight away after you<br>graduate we have options of work<br>placement so this is 10 weeks of work<br>experience it's usually<br>paid and it's in a business or<br>organization that's relevant to your<br>major as a scientist and so these are<br>three options um to allow you<br>flexibility for your the next stage of<br>your career development<br>so a lot of students might be asking<br>well why would i study at waikato why<br>would why would i go<br>to study there rather than a different<br>university and i would offer these five<br>points of difference<br>for you to consider when you're looking<br>at which university you go to<br>in the school of science we have<br>world-class facilities these are<br>cutting-edge research techniques that<br>you can use as an undergraduate student<br>depending on which papers to choose<br>you'll get a chance to be involved and<br>use real research equipment<br>we're really um<br>stressed the importance of hands-on<br>learning so a lot of a lot of scientific<br>techniques require<br>you to be practical and to interact with<br>instruments and the natural world and we<br>offer lots of opportunities both in the<br>lab and in with field trips for our<br>undergraduate students to learn hands-on<br>as i've mentioned we have a number of<br>options to allow you to transition from<br>your studying into your career<br>and these are flexible so we allow you<br>to choose which subjects you like and<br>then<br>choose the next stage of your career and<br>help you prepare for that<br>because our classes are small we offer a<br>personalized experience so your<br>lecturers and your tutors will know your<br>name you won't be just a number among<br>hundreds of students we'll know your<br>name and we'll look after you<br>and really important to us at the<br>university of waikato is that we embed<br>mata roma maori and in our degrees so<br>this is a really important part of being<br>a scientist in<br>aotearoa new zealand<br>now<br>and into the future and it's so<br>important that we put it<br>in prominence within our degree and<br>you'll learn it as you go along but<br>you'll also learn it<br>in a separate paper as<br>in third year<br>okay so we've talked about the degree<br>what about careers there are jobs lots<br>of jobs available for scientists so i<br>had a quick look on the seek website for<br>jobs that require scientists a few days<br>ago<br>and i found 230 jobs more than 230 jobs<br>in new zealand that require science<br>training and more than 60 jobs alone<br>requiring<br>a bachelor of science so let's have a<br>closer look at the kind of jobs that are<br>being advertised right now so perhaps<br>you are one of the people who wants to<br>work in a lab coat with safety glasses<br>in a lab there are jobs available for<br>people like that so here's an example of<br>a job in christchurch working in a in a<br>lab with pathogens<br>or perhaps you're someone who prefers to<br>work with data and works in on a<br>computer so here's a job for a<br>hydrologist modeler<br>with a consultancy company<br>requiring a bachelor of science<br>environmental earth science particularly<br>in hydrology<br>or perhaps you're someone who really<br>would rather be out in the forest<br>there's a terrestrial ecologist job<br>being advertised right now<br>with the hawke's bay regional council<br>where you'd be working with the regional<br>council to help protect our native<br>species<br>from<br>bio<br>biodiversity threats and from invasion<br>talking about invasion of other species<br>here's a really interesting job in based<br>in wellington with the ministry for<br>primary industries looking at<br>biosecurity risk so this would probably<br>be in an office in the middle of the<br>city as opposed to some of the other<br>jobs which are you'd be more based<br>in the regions and you'd be getting a<br>lot of work in the field this one would<br>be<br>i suspect working in<br>the central government as part of the<br>the government so a huge range of<br>different options for jobs<br>when you have a bachelor of science<br>so let's just talk a little bit about<br>what um the degrees that we offer and<br>how that's structured so i've mentioned<br>the bachelor of science a couple of<br>times and it's our it's our main degree<br>it's a three-year degree and you'll<br>study eight papers each year there are a<br>number of papers and they are in the<br>light gray boxes here that are required<br>for the degree and two of them are<br>around numerous science numeracy and<br>then there's fundamental papers as well<br>and you can see in the third year the<br>science and mathematic paper and the<br>work integrated learning paper that<br>career transition paper<br>and then in the red boxes you would<br>choose a subject or a major that you're<br>most interested in maybe it's chemistry<br>maybe it's ecology and biodiversity or<br>maybe it's aquaculture<br>and then you would also choose other<br>subjects now these could be from science<br>and you might like to choose a minor<br>subject from science but they could also<br>be from anywhere around the university<br>maybe you'd like to do a music paper or<br>maybe a philosophy paper that's all<br>possible within the bachelor of science<br>degree<br>if you're really certain that science is<br>what you want to study you might like to<br>consider a double major this is where<br>you choose two main subjects they have<br>equal weighting so perhaps you want to<br>combine environmental science and<br>chemistry<br>or ecology and biodiversity and earth<br>science you can do this with a double<br>major in the bachelor of science<br>our other main degree is the bachelor of<br>science and technology and that has a<br>slightly different structure you can see<br>that in the final year in the third year<br>and that is because we we place more<br>emphasis on the work integrated learning<br>here and we have a science work<br>placement that's worth two whole papers<br>it's a really important commitment to<br>transitioning into<br>a career in science within the bachelor<br>of science and technology<br>you can see that you do the same<br>other papers are identical and you<br>choose a major in exactly the same way<br>but you'd have a<br>larger opportunity<br>to have a work placement and real work<br>experience<br>so i've mentioned this work integrated<br>learning a few times and that's because<br>as a university we're really committed<br>to preparing our graduates for the<br>workforce and so we've got this work<br>integrated learning and i mentioned that<br>there's three options as as a science<br>student you can do a work placement you<br>can do an individual project or you can<br>do a group capstone project this gives<br>you the opportunity<br>to get paid while you study and also<br>provide more practical experience this<br>could be in the lab or it could be in<br>the field<br>there's also the opportunity to build<br>networks with employers and with<br>industry<br>when you're in your work placement or<br>your<br>the other options for the world papers<br>the work integrated learning papers<br>so why choose waikato well obviously the<br>work integrated learning gets you ready<br>for your<br>transition into your<br>paid employment as a scientist i've also<br>mentioned flexible degrees so you can<br>choose subjects and combinations that<br>you like<br>you can also choose papers outside<br>science if you want if you'd like to<br>we have a huge range of scholarships for<br>our students<br>and<br>you'll get to<br>interact with and be taught by<br>award-winning lecturers<br>for a world-class education<br>we really have two wonderful campuses<br>in hamilton and in tulanga and in both<br>cases we've got student accommodation on<br>campus to allow you that real student<br>experience<br>so i really hope to see you in 2020<br>doing a science degree with us at<br>waikato just a reminder of a couple<br>dates scholarship applications close at<br>the end of this month<br>and accommodation<br>applications close at the beginning of<br>october<br>applications to study at the university<br>are open right now so you can apply<br>right now<br>thanks a lot for joining me and i hope<br>to see you next year at the university</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
