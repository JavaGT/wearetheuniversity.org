talking about the<br>scholarship please note that the 21 days<br>left to apply counting down to the 31st<br>of<br>august deadline<br>was correct on the day that i took the<br>screenshot<br>but for current information please check<br>the current scholarships finder listings<br>now i'll tell you a bit about the<br>scholarship<br>if you will qualify for free fees free<br>in 2021<br>you should still apply for all of the<br>fees only scholarships you're eligible<br>for<br>the kotetangata scholarship is a good<br>example<br>fees only scholarships can reduce the<br>cost of accommodation at the university<br>of waikato hall of residence in the<br>first year<br>and or they can help you in your second<br>year and keep that student loan to a<br>minimum<br>this is another example of why you<br>should apply for every scholarship<br>you're eligible for<br>if you're eligible for the koti tangata<br>scholarship only you should apply for it<br>but if you're eligible for six school<br>leaver scholarships you should apply for<br>all of them<br>you're not being greedy you're just<br>increasing your chances of winning one<br>we suggest that you prepare before<br>applying for scholarships<br>if you check the advice on our<br>scholarships finder page you'll know<br>that before you apply you should check<br>the scholarship regulations especially<br>to find out if you're actually eligible<br>for that one<br>there are other things that you can do<br>to make scholarship applications easier<br>for example having documents such as<br>your ncea school leavers results summary<br>if you have to fill out a personal<br>statement form or supply a cv<br>before you do upload those documents<br>it's a good idea to show them to someone<br>who knows you well<br>that person might notice that you've<br>and there's a different personal<br>statement form<br>for each scholarship<br>if you are applying for multiple<br>scholarships and some personal statement<br>for questions or sections are identical<br>you can save time by copying and pasting<br>from another personal statement<br>however<br>please don't upload the same personal<br>statement form to all of your<br>scholarship applications<br>because some personal statements<br>if you upload the same personal<br>statement for each scholarship<br>application you may not be including the<br>information that that scholarship<br>selection panel needs to know<br>and that would severely decrease your<br>now this slide explains the processes<br>for the academic assessment<br>and other references<br>in your online application for school<br>lever scholarship you'll be asked to<br>enter the name of your principal<br>and their email address<br>some scholarship applications also ask<br>you to name<br>the person that you've asked to provide<br>a reference letter<br>sometimes there are even two referees<br>that you need to list<br>name and email address<br>please take care<br>to enter the name of the correct person<br>for example<br>if your school has decided that another<br>senior member of staff is to complete<br>the academic assessment form<br>you should enter that person's name and<br>email address not the principles<br>please also be careful to enter the name<br>and email address accurately<br>if there's a mistake in the email<br>address<br>when you submit your scholarship<br>application<br>and the automated request<br>goes out to that person<br>saying please complete the online<br>academic assessment form it won't reach<br>them because their email address is<br>wrong<br>and please be just as careful when you<br>enter a referee's name and email address<br>for the same reason<br>also<br>some principals or senior staff members<br>and or referees<br>really appreciate it when a student<br>tells them that they're going to apply<br>for a scholarship<br>so that they're not surprised when they<br>receive an automated message asking them<br>to support your<br>some principals or senior staff and or<br>referees also find it helpful if the<br>student gives them a copy of the<br>we also recommend that when you check<br>your my wakato portal<br>do do take notice has the academic<br>assessment been provided yet or has the<br>reference been provided or are you still<br>waiting<br>when it arrives in<br>our team has to record it for it to show<br>up
