10<br>or so minutes is talk to you about<br>psychology what we do at waikato and<br>what it can do for you<br>and how it all works<br>so sit back and enjoy<br>what you can do is you can study<br>psychology via a bachelor of science you<br>can do it as a bachelor of arts or via a<br>bachelor of social science<br>the difference between those<br>are the minors that you can take with<br>psychology as a major so<br>really it's an incredibly diverse<br>discipline<br>and really that allows you to select it<br>and use it<br>in the way that sees fit for you and<br>your purpose<br>that's what is one of the great<br>strengths of psychology<br>often people say what is psychology<br>people find it very hard to even define<br>it<br>and for me psychology is the science of<br>how we act<br>how we react to other people and then<br>how we interact<br>and that goes from how cells in the<br>brain communicate all the way through to<br>how cultures interact with each other<br>so it's very broad discipline and for<br>that reason we have all these different<br>ways in which you can take it as a major<br>and then you can mix it with those other<br>areas that you're interested in in your<br>studies so you might be interested in<br>say ecology<br>so you might do a batch of science or<br>you might be really interested<br>in environmental planning and then you<br>might be focusing on something like a<br>bachelor of social science<br>so whatever it is you want to do you can<br>mix it with psychology<br>psychology is also really a very popular<br>elective for other degrees such as<br>business things like human resources you<br>can see the synergies between psychology<br>and these other disciplines they're<br>quite clear once you think about it<br>things that will change in 2022 include<br>the fact that we're going to have a full<br>minor in kolpapa maori psychology which<br>is a particular strength at waikato<br>and we're also going to have a minor in<br>forensic psychology<br>as well<br>which is about how we understand<br>why crime occurs how to prevent crime<br>and to understand<br>so where can psychology take you<br>a lot of people do wonder about this and<br>so if you decide to do a degree in<br>psychology here at waikato then<br>psychology graduates tend to be<br>in very high demand when contrasted with<br>other undergraduate<br>degrees and that's because you get all<br>of these skills to do with<br>perspective taking understanding other<br>people but also decision making<br>leadership being able to articulate your<br>own position<br>and being able to be analytical with<br>data<br>so<br>you can<br>take roles and things from human<br>resources through to advertising and all<br>sorts of different sectors of employment<br>so psychology graduates do tend to have<br>a high employment rate after graduating<br>and also they tend to have a higher<br>income than other people with a first<br>undergraduate degree<br>and it's for that reason all of these<br>different skills that you pick up on the<br>way<br>with further study though you can become<br>a say registered psychologist or a<br>clinical psychologist and become<br>specialised in different areas<br>so it really depends on what it is that<br>you're focusing on and what your career<br>so why would you come to the university<br>of waikato<br>well actually<br>for me<br>reason number one is the most important<br>of all because it's a genuinely<br>welcoming and warm school okay so we're<br>just a really a nice bunch of people<br>which is very important um but also<br>we're really quite proud of what we do<br>and we're good at what we do<br>so the areas of psychology that we cover<br>at waikato<br>in my view are the most critical to<br>society at this point in time<br>they range from people focusing on<br>aspects of health and well-being in<br>different ways<br>through to understanding cognitive<br>processes and how the mind works and<br>then how perception interfaces with that<br>how do we see things how do we taste<br>things how do we smell things all of<br>that ties together<br>we look at things like environmental<br>psychology so why is it that some people<br>recycle when others do not why is it<br>that some people understand issues<br>related to climate change but others are<br>resistant<br>these are also things that are really<br>quite important<br>we also make sure that small group<br>teaching is retained for all papers uh<br>so that means that if you do do a paper<br>it's going to be something that people<br>are<br>um engaged with um but only you know a<br>few people at third 300 level uh and so<br>that's really great because it means<br>that you have this opportunity to really<br>interact with your peers you're not<br>going to be in a lecture room with 900<br>other students<br>now 300 level papers are really<br>typically more intimate as well which<br>means you get more sort of one-on-one<br>time with um the lecturers you can sort<br>of get to know them it's really quite<br>important<br>um and then underpinning all of this is<br>the fact that research in the school of<br>psychology is just of exceptional<br>quality and this knowledge feeds into<br>our teaching practices so it means that<br>the people that you see at the front of<br>the room delivering those lectures are<br>people who are really top of their game<br>in terms of understanding their<br>discipline<br>so in terms of employment and career<br>pathways<br>there are a number of different pathways<br>to become a recognized<br>new zealand psychology board<br>psychologist<br>in new zealand you can't say you're a<br>psychologist uh unless you are<br>registered as a psychologist<br>so it's a protected a legally protected<br>term so you can't have people just<br>sticking up a sign outside the house<br>saying i'm a psychologist because you<br>know those sorts of people could<br>potentially ruin someone's lives<br>but so here what we have is we have this<br>uh protected pathway<br>and so you can register as a<br>psychologist with the new zealand<br>psychology board<br>now<br>most people think of clinical psychology<br>um we offer that um at waikato<br>and so this is if you're interested in<br>things like interventions and treatment<br>for depression and phobias<br>we also offer community psychology you<br>can become registered by that pathway<br>too this is often field based<br>it's often copper maori focused and that<br>looks at things like interventions in<br>their development and then how to<br>interface with systems to improve them<br>there's also<br>other opportunities so behavioral<br>analysis for example which is about<br>treating individuals and helping<br>individuals that happen to have<br>long-term disorders or<br>say therapy with individuals with autism<br>or learning disabilities in order for<br>them to overcome some of those<br>disabilities so that they they are<br>better at learning for example at school<br>so each of these different pathways<br>gives you different sets of skills<br>but all of them require you know further<br>training after<br>undergraduate study<br>within business and industry<br>lots of people that do psychology end up<br>in marketing not surprising that's all<br>about how to get people to think about<br>what they're going to buy and try and<br>make people purchase things that they<br>may not have thought they might want<br>psychometrics is the measurement<br>of<br>how people think<br>and so<br>psychometrics is increasingly important<br>in business and industry<br>human resources not surprisingly ties to<br>psychology and then actually management<br>and leadership as well<br>many leaders<br>have a background in psychology because<br>of course it means you understand how<br>people think how they work what<br>motivates people how to get your<br>you know your team or the organization<br>behind you if you have a vision and a<br>plan<br>and also things like consumer behavior<br>tie into psychology too lots of people<br>that do psychology end up in government<br>agencies and non-governmental<br>organizations<br>this is in areas related to<br>policy making or being a policy analyst<br>and that's because you do learn lots of<br>skills related to statistics and how to<br>handle numbers in psychology<br>so data analysts are something that are<br>also<br>relatively common with a background in<br>psychology<br>people also end up doing research and<br>teaching<br>so<br>that means people go into academia<br>people like myself<br>or you know focus on the science of<br>psychology<br>and now of course<br>in ncaa levels<br>we also happen to have<br>psychology teaching in schools so that<br>means that you could become a secondary<br>school teacher and focus on psychology<br>which would be beneficial for everyone<br>and then actually there are all these<br>other areas as well so speech and<br>language therapies in the civil service<br>people working in i.t and how people<br>interface with computers and ergonomics<br>that's all psychology<br>okay so if you're going to do a degree<br>in psychology then how it works is that<br>in the first year you take<br>a couple of papers in psychology<br>um and<br>then you have lots of choice in terms of<br>the other things that you'd like to be<br>able to do so only two of those 100<br>level papers will be in psychology then<br>in your second year three of those<br>papers will be in psychology and finally<br>in the third year four of them will be<br>in psychology so you have some elective<br>choice in there as well and some that<br>are compulsory as a function of the<br>particular degree<br>that you're taking<br>so<br>for example if you're doing a bachelor<br>of science there may be some things<br>related to data or mathematics that are<br>required<br>handling whereas if you're doing a<br>bachelor of arts it may be understanding<br>cultures if you're doing a double major<br>that restricts your options in terms of<br>those electives but it means that you<br>can say that you've got a you know major<br>in psychology and also one another<br>discipline<br>such as<br>mathematics or computing<br>and so that can be very beneficial<br>but it does restrict choice in other<br>ways<br>so at waikato university work integrated<br>learning is a new initiative and the<br>idea of this is that actually um our<br>undergraduates go<br>out into the workforce and actually have<br>had some contact with the workforce<br>prior to<br>uh engaging with it after getting their<br>degree the idea that gives you a sort of<br>a foot up um<br>you know it may mean that you might even<br>get paid whilst you're studying<br>depending on the work integrated<br>learning placement that you happen to<br>have<br>and it means you just get some practical<br>experience in psychology that's a very<br>challenging thing to do<br>it doesn't necessarily mean that you'll<br>be doing therapies<br>in fact that's not something we<br>currently offer but what it does mean is<br>that you will have some understanding of<br>psychology in the workplace and that<br>okay so why would you choose waikato<br>well it's to do with work integrated<br>learning options uh the fact we have<br>this very flexible degree structure<br>especially for psychology you can take<br>it in all sorts of different ways there<br>are all of these scholarships that are<br>available for you as well<br>and<br>there our lecturers really are fantastic<br>i'm very proud of the people in the<br>school of psychology and we deliver this<br>top of the range world-class education<br>um and it's a beautiful place to be and<br>to live and to just experience doing a<br>degree<br>there are some key dates for you in<br>terms of scholarship applications and<br>so thank you so much for coming along<br>and for visiting this virtual open day<br>and i hope it's piqued your interest<br>have a look around the website get a<br>good idea of what's available here and<br>you'll really enjoy your
