faculty of law<br>for waikato university<br>now i assume that if you're looking at<br>this video you're considering studying<br>law<br>and one of the things that we find often<br>with our prospective students who are<br>looking at law is that they know<br>that they can go to a number of<br>institutions in new zealand do a<br>bachelor of laws and get qualified to be<br>a lawyer and that a lot of those core<br>components are going to be the same<br>everyone is going to study crimes<br>everyone is going to<br>get the basic basics of legal method so<br>the question is<br>why study law at waikoto so what i'm<br>going to try and do for you in this<br>session here is<br>um start out by looking at some of the<br>things that are unique to our faculty<br>and then drill down into<br>the specifics of our program and our<br>degrees some of that more crunchy<br>practical kind of knowledge that is<br>useful as well<br>so why study law at white cotswold<br>so<br>disputing a faculty of law was founded<br>on three core principles biculturalism<br>law and context and professionalism and<br>all three of these work together to<br>create the unique experience of studying<br>law here at waikato and work to shape<br>our graduates in really specific ways<br>and you'll see that reoccurring as<br>key themes as we move forward through<br>this<br>presentation<br>in terms of what our academics do the<br>kind of unique and specialized knowledge<br>that they bring to the table our faculty<br>has expertise in environmental law<br>modern indigenous governance public law<br>and policy and cyber law and the law of<br>new technologies<br>so we're on the cutting edge of really<br>pressing uh concerns whether that be<br>indigeneity<br>climate issues new technologies that are<br>emerging the law impacts every facet of<br>life and these urgent pressing ones are<br>areas where we excel<br>one of the really interesting things<br>about our faculty as well is that once<br>you're in you're in other institutions<br>in new zealand will take a class of<br>first-year law students but have a gpa<br>restriction on who can proceed into the<br>rest of the qualification we don't have<br>that<br>and the reason that we don't have that<br>is that we as an institution we believe<br>in investing in you<br>our goal here is to teach to educate to<br>help you grow not to uh cut out people<br>who who<br>for whatever reason the institution<br>feels don't meet the<br>cut we were the first llb or bachelor of<br>laws in new zealand committed to<br>teaching tihanga maori<br>we were the first llb in new zealand to<br>make corporate entities and dispute<br>resolution compulsory subjects in order<br>to ensure work ready graduates so this<br>is here where we can return to those<br>founding principles of biculturalism law<br>and context and professionalism<br>literally within the classes that we<br>teach the way that our degree<br>is structured we put our principles into<br>practice tikanga maori<br>is a compuls a core part of all of our<br>core teaching across the degree it's<br>such a relevant and lived<br>facet of life in new zealand how could<br>we possibly teach law without it and<br>similarly corporate entities in dispute<br>resolution those are bundled into our<br>bachelor's program not as options for<br>students to choose but as compulsory<br>aspects because<br>professionalism matters this is a<br>qualification designed to get you ready<br>to be out in the workforce as a lawyer<br>you need to be prepared to engage with<br>engage with business you need to be<br>prepared to resolve disputes<br>we also have the most flexible approach<br>to the study of law in new zealand there<br>are a number of pathways in and through<br>our degree<br>and i'll return to that a little bit<br>later in this presentation for some more<br>details so what to know about our<br>bachelor of laws or llb<br>it's a four-year degree<br>uh and it has three components which<br>we'll unpack in a second<br>as noted this is a professional<br>qualification so the emphasis here is on<br>skills you'll see uh key papers in here<br>such as legal method or dispute<br>resolution<br>uh<br>these are really focused on building the<br>skills that you will need to go out and<br>be<br>a lawyer<br>as i said the degree is four years but<br>has three components and we can split<br>those out really usefully to examine the<br>role that they play in your<br>comprehensive legal education<br>so<br>we've got them here<br>up here in the top left<br>in yellow we have the compulsory law<br>papers so most of these are subjects<br>that are set by the new zealand council<br>of legal education the accrediting body<br>these are the things that qualify you to<br>be a lawyer<br>regardless of where you go in the<br>country if you choose to study law you<br>will do public law and contracts and<br>torts and crimes and landlord and equity<br>in some<br>uh fashion the specific<br>paper breakdown might differ between<br>institution but the<br>need to pass exams in that subject will<br>remain<br>over on the side here we see what we<br>call our non-law electives so it's in<br>here that you could choose to take<br>subjects either out of interest or<br>things to support law or you could even<br>look at taking a second major in a<br>different subject that you really wanted<br>to drill into we see a lot of our<br>students taking uh secondary subjects or<br>secondary majors in areas like business<br>accounting psychology and political<br>science<br>really looking to diversify their own<br>individual approach to what it means to<br>practice law<br>and finally<br>we have what we call our law electives<br>so in your fourth year your final year<br>of the bachelor of laws<br>you will choose from a range of<br>available topics to sort of specialize<br>in areas for your career um you might<br>probably take some core things like<br>legal ethics that everyone sort of needs<br>to take to be a lawyer but then you can<br>drill down and focus on what is of<br>interest to you here is where you can<br>engage with your environmental law or<br>pacific people's law these sorts of<br>subjects<br>but what is it like to study in llb and<br>specifically what is it like to study an<br>llb at waikoto<br>one of the things to note is that this<br>is especially if you're shopping around<br>other subjects here in your virtual open<br>day um studying a bachelor of laws is a<br>little different to other degrees at<br>waikato we still have some year-long<br>papers instead of ones that just sit in<br>the single trimester there's just a few<br>in the first three years that work that<br>way<br>and those core subjects that everyone's<br>required to take often have large<br>end-of-year exams<br>which again is<br>perhaps less common in other areas of<br>the university<br>and the reason for this is that you may<br>have heard in popular culture elsewhere<br>this idea of like setting the bar exam<br>to become a lawyer so in new zealand we<br>don't have a bar exam instead the bar<br>exam is broken up into all of the<br>smaller exams that you take in these<br>specific required subjects so these<br>things<br>make you a lawyer<br>one of the things about that we like to<br>emphasize about studying with us here at<br>te piringa is that we have a really<br>strong student community because of the<br>compulsory and staged nature of the<br>qualification everyone is taking the<br>same papers together and so even though<br>we have quite a relatively large cohort<br>size people get to know each other and<br>because people know each other they can<br>support each other and they can kind of<br>grow together<br>we also have five student associations<br>who run their own events in terms of<br>support for study and also professional<br>uh engagements with members of<br>uh<br>law firms from around the country and<br>they also run key competitions we have<br>our general waikato university law<br>students association we have our women<br>in law association te whaka hiyopo our<br>maori law students association our<br>pacific law students association and<br>brand new as of this year our asian law<br>students association<br>and i highlight that the last one is<br>brand new because what i'd like to<br>emphasize for you here is that our<br>students are active and proactive and<br>are seeking ways to build that student<br>community to make sure that your voices<br>are heard and recognized and supported<br>but what if you don't want to be a<br>lawyer<br>or what if you don't know if you don't<br>know if you want to be a lawyer well<br>we've got an option for you as well<br>so we have a bachelor of arts major in<br>law so rather than the direct full four<br>year bachelor of laws program we have<br>this major under the bachelor of arts<br>and this offers the opportunity to get a<br>strong background in law and legal<br>principles as well as easily pair study<br>with another discipline maybe you know<br>right from the start that you don't<br>actually want to go<br>and practice law but you want to go and<br>work in<br>local government or you want to go be a<br>policy writer down in wellington and you<br>think i actually don't need that full<br>four years of study and all of those<br>very specific uh<br>topics what i really need is grounding<br>in law and maybe i want to do a second<br>major in political science or public<br>policy<br>or social social policy<br>uh the ba is a really great option there<br>put it to put it a different way<br>this also keeps your options open<br>because the first year papers that you<br>take under the bachelor of arts in law<br>are exactly the same as the papers in<br>the bachelor of laws first year which<br>means that you can credit those papers<br>over and in fact passing the first year<br>of the ba in law guarantees entry into<br>year two of the llb so if you're not<br>sure you want to test the waters uh this<br>is also a great<br>first step start out in the bam law see<br>how take that first year of papers see<br>how it works for you you might fall in<br>love with the practice of law and want<br>to pursue it or maybe you figure no i am<br>exactly where i want to be and i'm going<br>what if you live in toronto<br>really great question we are proud to<br>offer legal study via the taurang campus<br>so we currently offer a diploma in law<br>which those of you who are astute and<br>will have looked closely at the llb<br>structure will notice that the papers<br>under it are the same as the first<br>couple of years of the bachelor of laws<br>so we offer it by the toronto campus<br>which is a wonderful beautiful place it<br>contains the first and second year<br>papers of the llb<br>and completing it guarantees entry into<br>the third year of the llb so this like<br>that first year at the ba in law offers<br>a pathway into full<br>legal study<br>students who choose to study via the<br>tournament campus have provided access<br>to lecture recordings of the hamilton<br>lectures and attend in an in-person<br>tutorials for their papers at the<br>tauranga campus with our excellence<br>so this is where i want to return to<br>what i was saying about the fact that<br>our<br>law program is the most flexible in new<br>zealand uh there are so many pathways<br>that you can take to<br>engage with the study of law and you<br>retain the ability to be fluid and<br>flexible with those choices through a<br>large portion of your study so as just<br>noted you can commence in the diploma in<br>law you know maybe you are currently<br>working full-time and you think that<br>picking up this<br>qualification just part-time and<br>chipping away those first few papers is<br>a good option for you<br>as a noted it guarantees you entrance<br>into the llb when you pass those papers<br>so you can flow through in that way<br>obviously you could also just start<br>directly in the llb if you meet the<br>entry requirements and<br>know the path that you want to take<br>as we established before you could<br>commence in the ba in law and you could<br>finish in the ba in law or past those<br>first papers and realize that you<br>definitely definitely want to be a<br>lawyer and credit over into the llb<br>if you stay in the ba in law which is<br>the three-year program you are then<br>eligible for entry into our masters in<br>legal studies so in the same amount of<br>time as just the llb you could do your<br>three yet three year ba in law and then<br>carry on to complete a master's degree<br>which is worth noting is actually open<br>to anyone with a bachelor's degree in<br>any subject<br>with the llb itself every year<br>our top students are invited by<br>invitation to enroll in the llb honours<br>and this is a really valuable<br>accreditation achieving a level of<br>honours in your legal study<br>can open doors for you in the profession<br>it can be a really strong way of<br>standing out<br>as a<br>highly achieving and highly competent<br>practitioner<br>but even if you didn't gain your honors<br>accreditation through the invitation<br>into llb honours you could proceed<br>onwards into our master of laws or our<br>master of laws in maori and pacific and<br>indigenous peoples law<br>to return to our idea that our law<br>program is the most flexible in new<br>zealand the one thing that this diagram<br>does not show is that there's actually<br>another line that connects the llb back<br>to the ba and law in that much as you<br>could start in the ba in law to see<br>whether<br>fully practicing in law is the path that<br>you want to take<br>vice versa is also true if you start in<br>the bachelor of laws and get two years<br>in and realize<br>actually i don't think this is for me i<br>don't feel comfortable and it's a bit<br>daunting to commit to another two full<br>years of study you can credit out of the<br>bachelor of laws over into our ba in law<br>and complete that three-year program<br>instead<br>this map here shows where our tipiringer<br>graduates are operating in the world<br>right now<br>and what i hope you take from this is<br>the breadth<br>of where our graduates have gone i think<br>it would be very easy to think that in a<br>context of a new zealand university and<br>specifically in new zealand<br>university that specializes in such<br>topics as modern indigenous governance<br>that perhaps we're offering an education<br>that is incredibly local and inwardly<br>directed<br>and what i'd like to show you with this<br>image here is that that this is not the<br>case our graduates are highly<br>professional and highly ready to engage<br>with the practice of law<br>or the topic of law<br>globally<br>our graduates have gone on to be judges<br>clerks as supreme court justices<br>recipients of scholarships to read for<br>the prestigious master of laws at<br>cambridge members of law reform<br>commissions in new zealand the pacific<br>islands district court and maori land<br>court judges mps and city councillors<br>partners and firms founders of their own<br>firms the emphasis that we have placed<br>on our three founding goals of<br>biculturalism law and context and<br>multi-governance prepares our graduates<br>from professional life in new zealand<br>and abroad again we teach law and<br>context and what we mean by that is that<br>we don't just teach how law works or<br>the mechanisms of it what we call black<br>letter law we teach it in the context of<br>the world we teach it in the context of<br>society we engage with the role that it<br>plays the purpose that it is for the<br>things that it can do the significance<br>and the ethics of it<br>and those those skills<br>are eminently transferable<br>thank you so much for listening to this<br>talk about what's going on here at<br>tipiringa faculty of law here at waikato<br>university i hope that you're enjoying<br>your virtual open day experience some<br>key dates here for you up on the screen<br>which i'm sure you've seen if you've<br>watched
