accurate.</p><p>maori ki waikato is the name of our our<br>group that we have here roppu is full of<br>staff members that are here to help you<br>i was born and raised in te kwiti went<br>to study at<br>university of waikato in 2014 and i am<br>currently working on the deputy vice<br>chancellor maori office as a programs<br>coordinator for maori student<br>achievement so i run two programs one is<br>called tiahuritanga which is a maori<br>leadership program for our second and<br>third years and a first year transition<br>which we'll talk to you a bit more<br>and i am a student at waikato currently<br>in my last year last semester of my<br>degree so i'm studying bachelor of<br>science and i'm also a mentor for first<br>year science students at waikato calder<br>in the house so we're going to be<br>telling you guys a bit uh firstly what<br>what you your whanau can do to help help<br>your students if they're going off and<br>it can be quite scary especially if<br>they're first and finally going to<br>university uh on what you guys can help<br>so help with so we'll get into it<br>uh so here's our whanau hacks so the<br>first one um is to help your child or<br>your moko<br>articulate themselves for scholarship<br>applications so i know it is very hard<br>for maori people in general to boast<br>about themselves but to crack those<br>scholarships whanau you really need to<br>be helping<br>your child go through the applications<br>write up something fancy make sure<br>they're making themselves sound mean as<br>because i know all of our multifun do a<br>lot of work in the erie and the marae<br>and these schools in the community and<br>it can go unseen so make sure you<br>include all those things into your<br>scholarship applications because those<br>are going to be what's different so<br>please make sure you push your children<br>help them out to do scholarships because<br>they're going to help in the long run of<br>university<br>our next hack is attendance at 454<br>so every semester we have a portfolio to<br>welcome in all our new tawida who are<br>starting that semester and we invite<br>their whanau to come and join as well<br>for a lot of uh toyota and whanau this<br>is their first point of contact with the<br>university and it's an opportunity for<br>toeida to feel like campus is their home<br>away from home so uh yeah really<br>supports<br>alfano and their toyota to attend the<br>prophetic together um a great place to<br>ask heaps of questions especially you<br>know you're handing over your<br>child to the university for us to look<br>after them so it's a great place to meet<br>those people that will be looking after<br>your tamariki<br>super important to make sure that you<br>know your tom nikki feel like they're<br>getting supported from when they're<br>leaving home to their new home here to<br>waikato so another tip is to have early<br>in conversations with the child about<br>what they're good at and what they may<br>be interested in just because<br>a university is a vast range of papers<br>compared to high school so just because<br>you're good at chemistry and biology or<br>high school doesn't mean that you have<br>to do chemistry and biology and<br>university those subjects that you got<br>that you're good at and that you're<br>interested in can actually be expanded<br>into a lot diverse a lot more diverse<br>subjects and papers here at university<br>so make sure you talk to your uh you<br>know your tamaki earlier about what<br>they're interested in and what they're<br>good at so<br>make sure that you know high school<br>you're getting the most out of the<br>potential high school that if you look<br>at it this way you can get the most and<br>a lot more experience out of your<br>university<br>um<br>lifetime because it's a lot different to<br>high school there's a lot more subjects<br>there's a lot more help here you can go<br>deeper into the things you're actually<br>interested in not just stuff you're good<br>at so make sure you head on to the<br>waikato website look up to the papers<br>look up some stuff you're interested in<br>look at the bachelors look at the<br>degrees and see because it's a lot<br>different from high school a lot more<br>opportunities so that's another tip<br>cool so those are a few tips for before<br>university starts uh our next couple of<br>tips are for during university when<br>you're tawidad are actually studying in<br>the undergrad uh and so the first one is<br>to have regular chickens with your<br>toilet uh you know your students you<br>know your tamariki you know what they<br>need and you know how to offer them<br>support so uh be there be there to<br>support them when they need um help them<br>have realistic expectations on the time<br>commitment that university is going to<br>have um and just supporting and being<br>understanding that they might not be<br>able to come home every weekend<br>and by doing that we're helping them to<br>prioritize their school work um because<br>you know we want them to succeed while<br>they're here and if you want them to<br>succeed while they're here as well and<br>you're offering that support then it's a<br>win-win for everybody<br>flowey yes see if there's something on<br>the mariah can't call them up for the<br>dishes let them do the assignments<br>please why no uh when they finish their<br>degree they can come back and do the<br>dishes so the last thing here for our<br>whanau is to celebrate the small wins<br>with your student with your toeida with<br>your tamariki because they can make a<br>huge impact on their life at university<br>i remember my first year that spent<br>weeks doing this assignment took it to<br>my mom and said hey mom i've got a on<br>this do you want to read it she's like<br>no not really and i was like ah you know<br>i just spent all of this time stressing<br>everything put into this one assignment<br>and i was like oh man my mom doesn't<br>even care obviously she does but just<br>those small things and those small<br>celebrations can help uh tamariki you<br>know gain that next level of their life<br>you know the first time they go hey mom<br>i went shopping for the first time hey<br>mama i made my first dinner for the<br>first time i made this then i did my<br>washing like this celebrate with them<br>because those small things um they all<br>add up and when they're saying hey my<br>mom went to all my classes this week<br>giving them a thumbs up not the oh you<br>should be going every week you should be<br>doing this it can be quite tough and<br>then they want us might not want to be<br>calling mom up or dead after for some<br>help so make sure you celebrate those<br>small ones and keep encouraging them<br>throughout our university because it can<br>be a hard space official especially at<br>your first and final so now those are<br>our whanau tips we've got some for our<br>toeida<br>i mean so the first one um this is<br>before you before university starts<br>if you want to stay in the halls<br>if you don't want to stay in the halls<br>you should stay in the horse it's the<br>place to be you get put in a place with<br>heaps of other people um heaps of first<br>years you have ras you have people there<br>ready to help you you don't have to<br>worry about your kai you make your<br>you know you know you're going to get<br>fit every day your washing is all in the<br>one place you can go back somewhere<br>close to university have heaps of<br>friends and have another whanau on<br>campus there's also um<br>maori floors pacifica floors so if you<br>want to be jumping into one of these<br>hall uh floors<br>that's just maori heaps of multi support<br>you can sign up to those so stay in the<br>halls is um yeah a really good start to<br>your university career make heaps of<br>friends sort of boost you in those first<br>few weeks or months<br>of your university life<br>cool our next hack is to sort study link<br>early and early as capital letters for a<br>reason<br>almost every single student will need to<br>deal with study link at some point<br>during their studies<br>for either student allowance or student<br>loan uh or living costs as well and the<br>wait times for study link on the phone<br>and to get your<br>your letters back can be super long so<br>while we recommend getting in and<br>sorting out your study link early um<br>your whanau can help you with that as<br>well there are some forms that um need<br>parents information as well um so get<br>those forms in early um don't put<br>yourself out don't uh start worrying<br>about study link when you're already<br>studying at uni and you're starting to<br>get your first assignments in um sort it<br>out early just get it done whanau and um<br>yeah and you won't be the one on the<br>phone waiting half an hour for them to<br>answer your call<br>if you wait too long on study link then<br>you have to pay late fees at university<br>and you don't want that so make sure you<br>get in there early<br>so and the next tip whanau is what would<br>you do for someone to give you free<br>buddy<br>probably go to work do something crazy<br>all you have to do for this is write<br>down on a piece of paper and apply to<br>your scholarship so applying for<br>scholarships there's a plethora of them<br>outs everywhere you can get them from<br>the ew you can get grants from you here<br>you can get from different organizations<br>if you head on to the waikato page you<br>search up scholarships in the search bar<br>you're going to get a list of all of the<br>scholarships available at this time for<br>the university of waikato go through<br>make sure you're eligible to do it and<br>apply if you're eligible to do any<br>scholarship apply for it you might think<br>oh i might not be smart enough there or<br>you know i'm sort of into the tile stuff<br>it's like an environmental thing but i'm<br>only taking one paper if you're eligible<br>to apply for a whanau apply a lot of<br>scholarships<br>only get a few people applying some of<br>them don't get anyone applying it at all<br>so make sure you apply for scholarships<br>because just when you think you you<br>might not be eligible for it you might<br>not um get it because you're not going<br>to be the best person um it's more than<br>likely that you are the best person in<br>just trying to be too humble so make<br>sure you apply for all the scholarships<br>you can um yeah to make it a bit easier<br>at university<br>cool and our next tip is a little plug<br>for the jump start program so the jump<br>start program is an awesome opportunity<br>um for all toeida especially our school<br>leaders to bridge the gap between high<br>school and university so it's a<br>summer-based program where toyota can<br>take a couple of papers um and that'll<br>contribute towards the undergrad they<br>get to do a bit of bridging<br>between what it's like to study at high<br>school and what it's like to study at<br>university so it's really really good<br>for easing students in so that when they<br>do start their official bachelor's in a<br>semester<br>they're already set and they're good to<br>go they've got the study habits they<br>know what it's like to have a lecturer<br>uh it's just a really good introduction<br>to university like uh life so jump start<br>program<br>get on it<br>my way so that's pre university now<br>we're getting into stuff you should do<br>when you're at university<br>um<br>i'll throw it over to you jess kalpai so<br>we have um orientation weeks for both a<br>semester and b semester depending on<br>when you're looking at starting um the<br>university holds their own orientation<br>weeks and maori um there is a maori<br>orientation week for uh maori toyota as<br>well we encourage you to attend these<br>orientation weeks this is when you can<br>get introduced to the maori roku on<br>campus<br>meet your mentors and other maori staff<br>and see what sort of support and events<br>are out there for maori students in<br>particular and it's a really great uh<br>space where you can meet other<br>first-year maori students<br>yep<br>maori orientation the place to be so the<br>second tip here for uh when you're at<br>university<br>is to if you have the opportunity to<br>take an elective paper another paper<br>outside of your subject at uni you<br>should definitely do so so if you're<br>doing environmental go take a marketing<br>paper if you're doing law go take a film<br>paper you might just find out that that<br>thing's your passion or that one paper<br>is gonna help you add to your university<br>experience because doing a lot more<br>different papers a lot different<br>subjects when you finish university and<br>you have your bachelor's you're going to<br>have a lot more other papers underneath<br>your belt that's going to give you<br>different skills and stuff uh in the<br>industry or wherever you're going to go<br>and apply your degree it's going to help<br>in the future so if you do have a chance<br>to get electives<br>highly recommend taking something random<br>something you really want to do maybe<br>it's like a dance you know they have<br>dance papers you need to have music<br>papers at uni maybe it's like a trio<br>maori course up to you if you have a<br>chance to take an elective i highly<br>recommend it's quite refreshing i think<br>doing it outside of your subject gives<br>your brain a bit of a rest and it can be<br>quite easy i think applying um your<br>knowledge to a different uh subject so<br>yeah if you have the opportunity<br>take a different paper<br>oh kyota and our next tip is to make<br>good friends so that's making friends in<br>your classes in your labs and your<br>tutorials everywhere you go on campus um<br>this is a tip that i share with all my<br>first year toyota that i look after um<br>is to make good friends and good as in<br>records uh and emphasize there because<br>you want to make friends that show up to<br>the classes and show up to the labs<br>they'll be your go-to person if you have<br>that one itchy question that you need to<br>ask and you don't have the time to wait<br>for your lecturers to respond but you<br>know you had a mate in that class they<br>can also help you just to be motivated<br>to show up um yeah so making good<br>friends is super important and it'll<br>actually make a lot of your classes a<br>lot more enjoyable<br>make heaps of friends they're the key to<br>university success so<br>another tip is communication with your<br>lecturers your parents the ras your<br>whanau leaders uh your mentors and<br>making sure that you're responsible for<br>your actions so<br>there's a lot of help that you can get<br>here at waikato and people are here and<br>they want you to succeed but if you're<br>off the radar if you're not contacting<br>anybody then we can't contact you so the<br>main thing is to make sure you're<br>communic communicating straight with all<br>the people that want to help you if you<br>need help just call out and sing we're<br>not going to say oh<br>oh you know you're not good at uni<br>because you're wanting help our whole<br>job is situated around helping you so we<br>just want to get in there and help you<br>so make sure you keep our problems up<br>lecturers tutors you could email all<br>these people you might have the ultimate<br>doctor senior professor so and so that's<br>doing the lead i've researched in the<br>industry and you're like oh the bit of a<br>language i don't want to message them<br>you can email them whatever you want and<br>they have to email you back because they<br>are there to help you so make sure you<br>just keep in contact with everybody and<br>make sure that you're keeping it real<br>it's the number one self you know if<br>your tutor asks you hey how's that<br>assignment going due tomorrow and you go<br>yeah i'm almost done but you're still on<br>the first paragraph of your essay um<br>that prefer if you just said oh hey i'm<br>on my first paragraph then they can give<br>you the right advice to get it done<br>before the next day you know<br>if you say almost i'm not going to go<br>cool sweet as you're going to be in the<br>same position but if you just be honest<br>with them say hey i'm struggling a bit<br>hey could you send me those lecture<br>slides hey i need a bit of help with my<br>referencing or something i haven't done<br>don't be embarrassed just go ask him for<br>help and keep it real because if you<br>don't keep it real you're keeping a fake<br>i don't know what i was going with it<br>oh yeah just a total call that everyone<br>at university wants you to succeed all<br>your lecturers your staff your whanau<br>leaders they all want to see you succeed<br>and uh so yeah communicating with them<br>is is key because they're there to<br>support you and they want to help you<br>and see you be the best that you can be<br>and i'm just to continue with that<br>making the most of every opportunity is<br>our last tip for our toyota<br>and<br>it kind of links with what luke was just<br>talking about uh and i've heard him say<br>as well a couple of times that going to<br>your classes that's the bread and butter<br>of university but there's so much more<br>on offer<br>that can add to your university<br>experience and a lot of that comes from<br>those uh lecturers uh comes from those<br>whanau leaders it comes from<br>um there's so many opportunities for you<br>to attend different kaupapa on campus<br>that<br>are not only uh enjoyable and you'll<br>make friends but um they could be that<br>link that you need when you actually<br>leave university and you're trying to<br>get into a career space um so make the<br>most of every opportunity uh it's not<br>high school um we can't force you to do<br>everything we can have all the<br>opportunities for you but we're all<br>adults here and you have to take those<br>opportunities um yeah so especially for<br>first years there's so much available<br>there's so much on offer and we'll get<br>into that next<br>uh yeah yeah so in terms of<br>opportunities here we have i'll throw<br>back to you jazzy as one of our moldy<br>mentors you're gonna speak to us what<br>the money mental units are<br>cool so like i mentioned earlier i am a<br>mentor for first year maori science<br>students and so every first year student<br>on at waikato has a mentor assigned to<br>them depending on what they study and so<br>we have a really awesome whanau model<br>here at waikato where all our first year<br>students are placed into a whanau of<br>other students<br>um that are also studying similar topics<br>um they'll be led by a whanau leader<br>who would be the mentor so i'm a mentor<br>for a little whanau or here on campus or<br>first year science students um those<br>mentors are there to be your first point<br>of call for any type of advice any type<br>of academic support pastoral support<br>procedural support um course advice if<br>you just aren't comfortable even getting<br>in touch with your lecturer they're<br>there to help with that um yeah so<br>they're really a first port of call for<br>for all sorts of support uh something<br>that i've said before is that whatever<br>support looks like to you that's what we<br>want to offer um and that's really the<br>purpose of our mentoring unit here on<br>campus<br>kiora monumental is the place to be so<br>another port of support uh is our maori<br>students<br>so um here are all the other here it's<br>pretty much and each faculty they have a<br>ropu maori run by students for students<br>it just gives you the extra help that<br>you need at university make some friends<br>getting the same things that you know<br>they've got an environmental one they've<br>got one for maori studies they've got<br>one for<br>science so whatever you're studying<br>there's a support crew there for you and<br>these are the people that have done your<br>papers before they have you know they<br>might be your tutors they've done<br>they've experienced what first years are<br>they're made predominantly of second and<br>third years so you can just ask them<br>honestly oh hey what did you do for this<br>assignment they can give you tips and<br>clues on everything so those are our<br>multi-student<br>plenty plethora of opportunities so the<br>last thing i want to touch on is<br>te kahui pedi so takahi pde<br>is a first year transition program sorry<br>elijah cover his face that's all right<br>um for toei to maori here at university<br>and the first thing is to create a<br>whanau away from your whanau so i know a<br>lot of people travel away<br>from the whanau and they come to waikato<br>and we want to make this another safe<br>place for them to feel like home this is<br>an eew away from their own eew so all we<br>do is get all of our first years<br>together we have<br>we run<br>make sure you guys are all good you're<br>feeling safe at uni you're feeling like<br>this home and then we start getting into<br>workshops and support for you guys<br>really you know who you need to contact<br>we help you with everything and anything<br>you need workshops on referencing apa<br>um how to live how to be an adult<br>everything you need so when you come to<br>being your second year you're the master<br>of your own future and you can do<br>whatever you want to do so we give you<br>all the tools from there other than that<br>um that comes to the end of our<br>presentation the last thing is to follow<br>us on instagram and facebook oh and<br>tiktok we're officially tik tok famous<br>now um<br>this is where all your updates you'll<br>see about the student<br>updates about mental updates about what<br>our teddy is running about te kahui<br>pedia and all the other awesome<br>opportunities we have so uh from me and<br>jesse just want to say a big thank you<br>for tuning in i hope to see you guys<br>next
