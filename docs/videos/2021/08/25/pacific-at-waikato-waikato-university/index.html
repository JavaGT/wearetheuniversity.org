that was 995<br>past water to five parts land to be able<br>to voyage you had to be innovative<br>creative intelligent you had to be a<br>leader and we believe that all our<br>pacific students have this within them<br>as such we have a leadership and<br>excellence program for all our pacific<br>first year students it's called the emua<br>learner leader initiative<br>now the word emua it's a hawaiian word<br>that can be um<br>found in various specific languages as<br>well it's transliteration it simply<br>means to go forward and to lead from the<br>front so for our imua learner leader<br>initiative that we offer to all our<br>pacific first-year students we give them<br>additional academic and additional<br>leadership skills that will really help<br>them in their first year and prepare<br>them to not only survive but thrive at<br>university we have um generations of<br>of families um who have come through the<br>university of waikato we believe in<br>collective success and responsibility so<br>when you come and you're part of our<br>ayinga our<br>we are here to support you to encourage<br>you to reach your goal whatever that may<br>look like our challenge the
