everybody<br>thank you for joining me for this<br>virtual open day presentation<br>my name is dr simon peale and i am the<br>college director of the university of<br>waikato college and it's my pleasure to<br>talk to you a bit about the college the<br>university and the programs that we<br>offer<br>so you'll see on the map where new<br>zealand is located and the university of<br>waikato campus is located in hamilton<br>which is a major city one and a half<br>hours drive south of auckland<br>international airport our other campus<br>so why choose new zealand for your<br>education<br>well the main reason the first reason<br>is quality<br>all new zealand universities are ranked<br>uh in the top 500 in the world there are<br>eight universities in new zealand and<br>they are all high quality<br>it's a safe country in fact it's the<br>second most peaceful country in the<br>world according to the global peace<br>index<br>another good reason<br>is work opportunities many international<br>students are eligible for a three-year<br>work visa after graduation<br>a very important reason is the quality<br>of life in new zealand<br>easy-going lifestyle stunning natural<br>beauty<br>new zealand<br>is a relatively small country with five<br>million people<br>new zealanders are interested in<br>outdoors they're interested in sport<br>they're interested in the rest of the<br>world<br>so in short it's a great place to study<br>employability is another reason why some<br>students choose new zealand<br>because it has a strong economy that's<br>projected to do well in the coming years<br>and has skill shortages in several<br>important areas<br>so the pers post study work pathway is<br>something that many students consider as<br>important<br>because a three year visa after study is<br>very important<br>so let's talk about covert 19. of course<br>it's a big challenge for everybody<br>and it means that the borders are<br>currently closed and<br>visas for new students will not be<br>processed until at least february 2022<br>and so we'll be teaching fully online to<br>those new international students<br>for our students in new zealand we teach<br>face-to-face<br>but for everybody else we'll teach<br>online<br>students will be able to come to new<br>zealand and continue their studies face<br>to face when the borders reopen<br>so to make things easier for students<br>applying we can<br>accept provisional and calculated grades<br>we also accept a range of english tests<br>and we provide full online support for<br>all of our students<br>so i'd like to tell you a bit about the<br>university of waikato<br>as i mentioned before it's located in<br>hamilton the main campus and also in<br>taranga these are in the north island of<br>new zealand<br>12 000 students<br>2 000 international students<br>and the university itself is famous for<br>for certain things it's famous for its<br>management school which is in the top 1<br>of management schools<br>it's famous for its computing facilities<br>it's famous for its commitment to the<br>environment and sustainability<br>and an important feature of many<br>programs at the university is the focus<br>on internships and work placement<br>we know that the kind of work experience<br>will help students<br>in their later careers<br>the cost is also an important factor and<br>new zealand is a cheaper country to<br>study in than some other countries and<br>living in hamilton is cheaper than<br>living in some major cities like<br>auckland sydney or melbourne<br>so here's a picture of hamilton city and<br>the river the waikato river which the<br>university is named after<br>and here's a picture of the campus<br>and it's important to note that the<br>university of waikato is a campus<br>university with<br>that means that it's it's a full<br>living community we have students living<br>in the halls of residence we have the<br>sports facilities recreation facilities<br>all the teaching research facilities all<br>located<br>on one campus which is a good selling<br>point for students who want a<br>the other opportunity for our students<br>is to study in tauranga which is a<br>beautiful city located on the coast<br>with beautiful beaches<br>it's a purpose-built<br>new campus built in 2019<br>which has high class facilities and<br>to go along with the high quality<br>teaching and research tauranga is a<br>fast-growing city for<br>obvious reasons it's a beautiful<br>location<br>and we offer a range of programs at that<br>campus<br>and students starting their studies face<br>face-to-face and tauranga are eligible<br>for fees but siri<br>so<br>as a comprehensive university the<br>university of waikato has many of the<br>areas that you would expect to see in a<br>large university<br>psychology social sciences computing<br>mathematical sciences<br>education<br>engineering health science<br>the management school faculty of law<br>faculty of maori and indigenous studies<br>the university of waikato college that i<br>am the director of<br>and the school of graduate research<br>but let me tell you a bit about the<br>college so the university of waikato<br>college exists to<br>provide students with a pathway into<br>most undergraduate and postgraduate<br>courses that they might want to study so<br>it's an international college<br>with a range of programs for<br>international students including<br>academic english programs<br>standard and accelerated foundation<br>program<br>international diplomas which are the<br>first year of bachelor's degree<br>and a pre-masters program<br>all of our programs are taught by<br>qualified experienced teachers who<br>understand international students and<br>have lots of experience teaching<br>international students<br>we keep our class sizes small so that we<br>can provide individual attention and<br>provide a supportive personal<br>learning environment<br>we have student advisors who speak the<br>key languages that our students speak<br>and we are based in the middle of the<br>campus which means that our students<br>have exactly the same access to<br>facilities as other students at the<br>university all of the students in the in<br>the college are university students from<br>so let's talk about the programs we<br>offer in the college<br>and the first one i'll talk about is the<br>certificate of attainment in english<br>language so this is for international<br>students who need to improve their<br>english language skills in order to get<br>into whichever degree<br>they choose<br>and<br>by completing this course it means the<br>students don't need to do an ielts test<br>completion of our english language<br>program will give<br>entry into degree studies<br>we have multiple intakes during the year<br>so there's always an english language<br>course about to start soon<br>now we teach the academic english<br>program at multiple levels<br>so looking at the bottom first<br>level eight is our highest level that is<br>the level that students must complete if<br>they wish to do postgraduate study so<br>students will study level 8 and go on to<br>a master's degree<br>level 7 gives access to<br>most undergraduate degrees<br>level 6 gives access to our foundation<br>studies program or international<br>diplomas<br>and the other levels below that allow<br>students to progress through each of the<br>levels so that they can get to the level<br>they need to get into the degree that<br>they need<br>foundation studies is obviously one of<br>our most important programs and we have<br>two versions of foundation studies a<br>shorter version for students who have<br>more academic background<br>and<br>a standard version<br>both of these programs have a mixture of<br>compulsory courses and elective courses<br>and combine<br>academic english<br>with<br>those<br>range of electives students can choose<br>based on which degree they want to<br>progress into<br>the short version<br>is one trimester of study five months<br>and the longer version is two trimesters<br>of studies either eight or nine months<br>completion of the foundation studies<br>program will give students entry into<br>all bachelor's degrees in the university<br>international diploma of business<br>is our newest program that we launched<br>at the beginning of this year the<br>international diploma of business is<br>essentially the first year of the<br>bachelor of business plus<br>academic skills and academic english<br>so students who successfully complete<br>the international diploma of business<br>progress into year two of the bachelor<br>of business<br>is the um obviously the business goal as<br>i mentioned before is triple crown<br>accredited which means it's the top one<br>percent of business schools in the world<br>and as i mentioned essentially the<br>international diploma of business is all<br>of the basic bachelor of business<br>courses plus english academic skills<br>development you can complete it in one<br>year 12 months with three trimesters of<br>study which means that you can do the<br>international diploma progress to the<br>second year of bachelor of business<br>now very same thing applies to the<br>international diploma of computer<br>science except that the students who<br>complete this program will progress into<br>the second year of either the bachelor<br>of science<br>or the bachelor of computer science<br>so essentially we have the first year of<br>those bachelor's degrees plus<br>academic and english development<br>and we complete all of that in 12 months<br>three trimesters of study and then the<br>students who are successful in<br>completing the international diploma<br>will progress into the second year of<br>either of those two bachelor's degrees<br>either the bachelor of science computing<br>or the bachelor of computer science<br>coming up later this year we will offer<br>our next new program we will launch the<br>diploma in postgraduate preparation<br>which is our pre-masters program<br>so this is designed to allow<br>international students<br>who don't have a new zealand bachelor<br>degree<br>or the equivalence of a new zealand<br>bachelor degree to progress into<br>postgraduate studies<br>it's a two trimester program eight<br>months<br>120 credit level 7 diploma<br>and it offers an alternative pathway for<br>international students into a range of<br>master's degrees in either business or<br>information technology<br>so<br>in order to enter our pre-masters<br>program you must have completed at least<br>two years of tertiary study and achieved<br>a qualification that is at least<br>equivalent to a new zealand level six<br>uh nzqrf new zealand qualification<br>framework level six qualification which<br>means that a dojo one qualification or<br>an associate degree or an advanced<br>diploma<br>will meet the entry for pre-masters<br>students must also have ielts 6.0<br>if you don't have ielts 6.0 then you can<br>study our academic english program first<br>before progressing into this one<br>so we think this is a really exciting<br>program<br>because it offers an opportunity for<br>students who do not have<br>for example<br>a degree in business to do<br>a master's degree in business by<br>having some previous academic study<br>and then this<br>pre-masters program then they can enter<br>for example the master of business<br>management<br>so scholarships are very important to<br>most students and so<br>there are a range of scholarships<br>available for all the different programs<br>so i won't go into details about all of<br>them because it all depends on<br>the circumstances of the student and<br>what you might be applying for but<br>there are a range of scholarship<br>programs available to support students<br>and for those students who are able to<br>to come to campus when the borders<br>reopen<br>as i mentioned before there are some<br>great accommodation options<br>on campus students can<br>choose between<br>catered halls where all meals are<br>provided<br>you have a private bedroom<br>and you know good for those students who<br>don't want to cook<br>and for those students who want to cook<br>their own food or share with others<br>we have other accommodation options<br>and of course the the price of those<br>is listed also on this slide<br>so we've come to the end of the<br>presentation now and i want to thank you<br>for your time and attention and direct<br>you to the websites at the bottom of the<br>page<br>pathways.waikato.ac.nz is our college<br>website where you can find more<br>information about all of our programs<br>pathways dot waikato dot ac.nz and uh<br>pretty much everything that you would<br>need to know is listed on our website<br>thank you for your attention<br>and i do hope we can see you at
