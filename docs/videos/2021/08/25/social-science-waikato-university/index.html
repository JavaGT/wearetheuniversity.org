accurate.</p><p>hello and welcome<br>my name is bruce curtis<br>and i am the head of school<br>for the school of social sciences<br>and i'm here to provide you today with<br>an introduction and overview about some<br>of the activities you can do in the<br>school of social sciences some of our<br>subjects some of our qualifications<br>and some of the support you can receive<br>when i'm not<br>operating as a head of school<br>i have an office downstairs from my<br>office as head of school where i am a<br>sociologist i'm a professor of sociology<br>and<br>when i'm there i teach and research in<br>the areas of<br>research methods<br>the impact of new technologies<br>how higher education<br>is um going to be restructured or is<br>changing over time and i'm also very<br>interested in<br>a new area of research for me which is<br>the relationship between humans and<br>animals and in particular how that<br>relationship's going to change in this<br>period of time that we can call the<br>anthropocene and proposing's a good word<br>that you uh probably want to familiar<br>familiarise yourself with<br>it refers to an epoch of time or a<br>period of time in which the impacts of<br>humans are the defining characteristic<br>of the planet planet earth<br>so as i've said<br>i'm going to uh carry on in this talk uh<br>and provide you with some overheads<br>about a degree structure um work<br>integrated learning and how you can get<br>some support<br>and then when i've completed that<br>you'll have three or four or five<br>minutes from some of my colleagues dr<br>christina hannah just dr justin phillips<br>professor katrina rowan and dr dan<br>weeges and they're going to talk about<br>their areas of research and teaching and<br>specialisation<br>um dr hannah is going to talk to you<br>about climate change and strategic<br>retreat<br>dr phillips is going to talk to you<br>about potentials and risks of big data<br>professor katrina rowan is going to talk<br>to you about identity gender and<br>sexuality and dr dan wedges is going to<br>talk to you about artificial<br>intelligence and he's calling it ai<br>proofing<br>okay<br>let's start with an overview<br>i think the best place to start is to<br>say<br>the school of social science<br>is a very diverse place<br>where there is lots of potential for you<br>to undertake all different forms of<br>study<br>and uh all different forms of research<br>later on down the line<br>if if we focus on the undergraduate<br>qualifications the main qualifications<br>i'm going to talk to you about today are<br>really about our four of our key degrees<br>or four of our key undergraduate degrees<br>the bachelor of arts the bachelor of<br>environmental planning the bachelor of<br>social sciences and the bachelor of<br>social work so there are four of the key<br>degrees that the vast majority of our<br>students<br>do<br>in the first three or four years at<br>university<br>when we think about those degrees<br>there are a range of subjects you can do<br>those degrees in or actually actually<br>the other way around you can do those<br>subjects in a number of those degrees<br>you can do them in anthropology<br>environment and society environmental<br>planning i won't read the list but all<br>the way from enviro anthropology down to<br>sociology<br>now some of those subjects you can take<br>as majors<br>and i will list those anthropology<br>environmental planning geography history<br>philosophy political science sociology<br>and social policy<br>those majors are<br>subjects that you would get your degree<br>in for example you might do a bachelor<br>of social science in sociology or a<br>bachelor of social science in geography<br>you could also do<br>a bachelor of arts in history or you<br>could even do a bachelor of arts in<br>social policy there's a lot of<br>flexibility there in being able to mix<br>and match between the degrees and the<br>subjects and in particular the majors<br>you can also if you're<br>feeling keen<br>um<br>talk about uh<br>a minor now our subjects are divided<br>into majors n minus and here's a simple<br>looking degree structure this would<br>apply for any of our three-year degrees<br>and if you can look if you look at this<br>outline you can see we have the red<br>colored papers which are the papers that<br>are the majors in your degree<br>and then we have<br>some<br>uh gray colored papers which are your<br>other compulsory papers that we feel<br>that you need to do to be able to<br>complete the degree<br>and then you've got a range of black or<br>dark gray papers which you can either<br>use as electives or free papers or you<br>can do something called a minor now a<br>minor is<br>all the subjects that aren't majors is a<br>simple way of saying it so you could for<br>example have a bachelor of social<br>science majoring in philosophy with a<br>minor in ethics<br>there's a remarkable number of<br>combinations that won't go through all<br>of them um the other option of course is<br>for you to<br>do a double major in your degree<br>and here it's quite a simple sort of<br>arrangement you've got you could major<br>in<br>a ba or a b socks eye of social science<br>say you could major in geography and<br>history or social policy and philosophy<br>or sociology and anthropology there are<br>lots of very common um<br>arrangements<br>this is the best way to get the most<br>value out of your degree i have to say<br>cost you no more money<br>but it means that you can structure a<br>degree and have two majors in your<br>degree<br>so<br>i mean that's an overview that i've<br>taken about<br>two minutes if that to talk about and i<br>don't expect you to be able to<br>grab that immediately<br>we have quite<br>extensive student support available here<br>in the school<br>and the four email addresses down the<br>bottom there<br>uh the key addresses that you should be<br>emailing to if you want any assistance<br>whatsoever<br>in terms of enrolling or in terms of<br>your ongoing participation at the<br>university<br>it's just a simple matter of sending<br>that those four email addresses an<br>inquiry and you will get<br>a pretty much immediate response we have<br>quite a large behind-the-scenes group of<br>people that are there to provide care<br>pastoral support student advice to<br>students and i urge you if you're<br>interested in any aspect<br>of the university to to write to one of<br>those four addresses or to write to more<br>so i've briefly touched upon<br>the degree structure here very briefly<br>of our subjects which have broken up<br>into majors and minors and we've got<br>degrees that you can do those majors and<br>minors in<br>another thing that we have at this<br>university and that we are very proud of<br>and in fact i think we are a new zealand<br>leader in this is something that we're<br>calling work integrated learning<br>work integrated learning is something<br>that is made available to students in<br>their third year of study<br>so it's a couple of years away yet for<br>the for those of you think about<br>enrolling but uh you can this is about<br>making you work ready uh to allow you to<br>build networks to actually move beyond<br>the university<br>context to get a job some of our<br>students some of you might decide that<br>the next step you want to take us for<br>further study and in further study<br>beyond that and in fact aim for<br>a career in academia<br>the majority of students probably will<br>work in a job outside the university<br>context the great majority of students<br>will and this work integrated learning<br>is a way in which we're trying to help<br>you prepare to make those decisions<br>you can do two sorts of work integrated<br>learning activities<br>you can either undertake what we call a<br>work placement where you actually work<br>at the place of work<br>of an employer and you would work there<br>for around about a hundred hours<br>in a trimester<br>uh or you can<br>do a project here on campus at the<br>university um both of these options<br>count towards the<br>qualifications and the points that you<br>need to complete your degree but<br>university of waikato is the only<br>university in new zealand that offers<br>every one of its students the chance to<br>do work integrated learning and i think<br>um<br>we have a little screen here that says<br>why choose waikato<br>i'm supposed hopefully i've ticked off<br>some of these work integrated learning<br>i've talked about a very flexible degree<br>structure<br>i haven't mentioned the huge range of<br>scholarships but they are very extensive<br>we have<br>quite a few benefactors to the<br>university<br>that have set up scholarships that are<br>available different sorts of students<br>and the university puts aside a<br>considerable amount of money to<br>facilitate and help students coming into<br>the university context<br>um<br>and that is really worth exploring and<br>one they might even be one of the<br>questions that you might ask some of<br>those support<br>people that i showed in the uh with the<br>set of emails<br>the other one is award-winning lecturers<br>and their world-class education you're<br>going to hear a bit more about those<br>award-winning lecturers in the sections<br>following me and indeed i think you've<br>got four of some of the best<br>researchers and lecturers in new zealand<br>talking to you after me<br>it's a great campus and we have<br>fantastic student accommodation and<br>we're building that student<br>accommodation all the time we're very<br>keen for students to<br>come to campus stay on campus have a<br>great campus experience it's very much<br>focused about a good university a good<br>student experience<br>um i mean i've got a little phrase about<br>why you'd come to the university of<br>waikato<br>it hasn't made it into our marketing<br>material but i would say that the<br>university of waikato was all about<br>taking the local global<br>and at the same time making the global<br>local<br>maybe that's a bit sort of neat and tidy<br>but i i think that's where this<br>university is<br>leading edge in new zealand that<br>interaction between local and global<br>global and local<br>and i think it's a pretty exciting place<br>okay<br>i have<br>looks like i've actually managed to make<br>it through in the three or four minutes<br>that i was given to talk about here are<br>some key dates for you<br>the main one i guess is that<br>applications are open now<br>so if you're interested in applying go<br>back to those contact addresses that i<br>spoke about four or five slides ago and<br>start emailing those go to the<br>university website uh and start um<br>making your application there<br>uh and um you can see that the uh<br>applications for the halls are open<br>already but they're gonna be able for<br>another six weeks so there's plenty of<br>time to make applications we want to<br>stay in the hall of residence<br>if you want to make an application for a<br>scholarship<br>it would be good to do so as soon as<br>possible<br>our<br>formal closing date for those<br>scholarships is the 31st of august so um<br>i would if you're interested in finding<br>out more about scholarships<br>you should contact those<br>contact emails i gave you earlier on you<br>might be able to hear my cat in the<br>background who's just decided and<br>decided to come sit on my lap anyway um<br>i will say goodbye now i wish you all<br>the best of luck and the next voice you<br>hear should be dr christina hannah who's<br>going to be<br>talking about uh changes in the<br>environment and the notion of<br>strategic retreat thank you very much<br>and very best of luck kia ora koto it's<br>dan vales here from the philosophy<br>program and i'm here to tell you that<br>everything you thought you knew about<br>getting a degree in order to get a job<br>is wrong<br>i don't blame you<br>everyone's been telling you that<br>medicine law accounting business they're<br>the things you need to study if you want<br>to be sure you're going to get a job or<br>a good job after you finish<br>well that's just wrong<br>unfortunately they probably haven't been<br>thinking too much about what's happening<br>with artificial intelligence machine<br>learning and all these other advances<br>that we're seeing around us<br>basically<br>machines especially artificially<br>intelligent machines are very good at<br>following rules remembering lists of<br>things and they're the kinds of things<br>that you'll do<br>in medicine in law and accounting and<br>business<br>they're also very good at discovering<br>patterns and working out what makes<br>people buy certain things just by<br>looking at the actual facts of what's<br>happened because a lot of the<br>transactions are online so that's<br>business covered off accounting is<br>effectively just following rules and<br>applying the rules to some data that you<br>already have a lot of law is just<br>putting the different person's name into<br>a template any anyone can do that a lot<br>of medicine is remembering lists of<br>symptoms<br>and knowing what um<br>condition is likely to be coming out of<br>those symptoms so when you're at your gp<br>and you're talking to them<br>they may be tapping in notes about what<br>you're saying but they may also be<br>tapping in<br>your symptoms to see what webmd has to<br>say about what you might have<br>so when you think about it um artificial<br>intelligence and computers programs are<br>so good at doing all of these things but<br>there's some things that they're not so<br>good at doing and there's some things<br>that they can't do so all of the<br>artificial intelligence machine learning<br>is constrained by certain parameters<br>certain rules and certain goals<br>but who comes up with those goals and<br>those rules well i would say it's people<br>who are good at thinking critically<br>thinking creatively and thinking<br>holistically<br>now these are the kinds of thinking<br>skills that will help you in the kinds<br>of jobs that ai and other forms of<br>technology can't do so i call them ai<br>proof thinking skills critical thinking<br>creative thinking and holistic thinking<br>if you can do those things well you'll<br>be ready to do all the jobs that aren't<br>sucked up by all artificial intelligence<br>and machine learning<br>and they're the kinds of skills that<br>you'll learn when you study social<br>sciences social sciences involve<br>thinking about human values and other<br>values as well as scientific evidence<br>bringing them together to look at<br>complex issues and try and solve those<br>complex issues using multiple methods<br>now importantly<br>who makes the rules and who sets the<br>goals for artificial intelligence and<br>machine learning now that's the kind of<br>thing that they shouldn't be doing for<br>themselves<br>that's the kind of thing people with<br>critical creative and holistic thinking<br>skills should be doing people who have<br>had experience thinking about different<br>values and weighing them up with the<br>scientific evidence to work out what is<br>the thing that we should do here in this<br>complex situation<br>if you study social sciences you'll have<br>those skills you'll have ai proof<br>thinking skills and you'll be ready to<br>hit the workplace and you'll be doing<br>the jobs in which you make the rules<br>rather than the jobs in which you follow<br>the rules so if you want to make the<br>rules instead of follow the rules you<br>should study social sciences because if<br>you just end up following the rules you<br>should know there'll be a machine out<br>there that can do your job a lot better<br>than you and your career may not be a<br>long one kodokoto my name is christina<br>and i'm a lecturer in environmental<br>planning<br>today i will be briefly discussing one<br>of our many research areas that we teach<br>in order to prepare you for working in a<br>changing world<br>as i'm sure you are aware we are living<br>in a state of compounding crises<br>with our health<br>climate ecosystems and housing to name a<br>few<br>humanity's impact on the earth is so<br>profound that we now term this geologic<br>era the anthropocene the age of human<br>it can be overwhelming to hear the<br>evidence of humanity's impact on the<br>planet but this is a story of hope you<br>just have to bear with me for a little<br>bit<br>humans have caused vast extinctions of<br>animals and plants polluted the earth<br>soil and water with plastic<br>made vast bodies of water uninhabitable<br>drain and sealed masses of hectares of<br>land for sprawling urban centres and<br>private transportation<br>global warming is likely to reach 1.5<br>degrees above pre-industrial levels in<br>the next decade if we continue along our<br>current emissions pathway<br>beyond 1.5 degrees of warming we will<br>not be able to avoid catastrophic<br>as environmental planners we aim to<br>protect preserve and enhance the natural<br>unbuilt environments<br>to help address these socio-ecological<br>crises<br>from housing to transport national parks<br>waterways and farmland<br>planners manage how we use and<br>deal with our natural and physical<br>resources<br>however for climate change in particular<br>reducing our impacts will not be enough<br>as much of the warming is cooked into<br>the system already and we are having to<br>adapt to a new normal as you can see on<br>this slide<br>in aotearoa this new normal includes<br>rising sea levels an increase in floods<br>and droughts<br>changing wind and rainfall patterns<br>increased temperatures and more pressure<br>on our ecosystems<br>but rather than succumbing to climate<br>doomism<br>we must use the tools and skills we have<br>available to adapt<br>humans and particularly in indigenous<br>communities have adapted to<br>environmental change throughout history<br>using our forward-thinking strategic<br>planning skills we can reimagine the<br>former nature of our settlements and<br>create opportunities to build resilience<br>strategic retreat is an example of<br>working with rather than against nature<br>by strategically withdrawing<br>unsustainable development from risky<br>spaces we can create buffers for<br>environmental change and ensure<br>ecosystems have space to migrate inland<br>as sea level encroaches on coastal<br>margins<br>whilst relocating homes businesses and<br>infrastructure will require significant<br>sacrifices to change the way we use<br>certain land areas here via retreat<br>it will reduce future emergency<br>management costs and in some cases<br>enable us to restore nature's regulating<br>developing climate resilient pathways<br>creates hope for the future<br>enabling us to create adaptive learning<br>increase scientific knowledge and<br>undertake effective adaptation and<br>mitigation measures and other choices<br>that reduce risk<br>strategic retreat is just one of the<br>many ways to adapt to a changing<br>environment and move along these climate<br>resilient pathways<br>and we look forward to developing your<br>skills to create innovative and adaptive<br>solutions for a more resilient future<br>thanks for listening and if you'd like<br>to check us out on instagram and<br>facebook have a look at planning<br>planning waikato<br>thank you<br>kia ora<br>i'm katrina rowan and i'm going to tell<br>you about three of the subject areas<br>that you might choose within the school<br>gender and sexuality studies is a minor<br>that you can take as part of your degree<br>program<br>in gender and sexuality studies we<br>discuss questions like<br>why do schools struggle to make<br>sexuality education interesting and<br>worthwhile for students<br>if you think back over your years at<br>school i wonder do you have good<br>memories of sexuality education<br>was this topic addressed at school in a<br>way that you found inspiring and<br>informative<br>in many places this topic is hardly<br>taught at all when it is taught it's<br>often not taught well<br>why is this<br>these kinds of questions open up all<br>sorts of opportunities that we can think<br>about in gender and sexuality studies<br>for instance we might explore the<br>implications for how young people are<br>taught about sexuality what are the<br>consequences in societies where these<br>kinds of topics are simply not taught<br>well<br>another example of a question that we<br>address in gender and sexuality studies<br>is how have popular representations of<br>masculinity changed over time<br>think about this for a moment<br>when i say the word masculinity what<br>does it make you think of<br>what is masculinity<br>is it something we do<br>can anyone do masculinity<br>or is it something we are<br>is masculinity the same in different<br>parts of the world<br>researchers have examined masculinity in<br>different times and places and their<br>work helps us to think about the concept<br>of masculinity and how it relates to our<br>in gender and sexuality studies we<br>explore opportunities for empowerment<br>and social change<br>we learn about social movements and<br>ideas such as environmental feminism or<br>intersex advocacy<br>one of the social movements we read and<br>talk about is mana wahine which is a<br>part of maori or indigenous thinking<br>about gender cultural identity and<br>empowerment<br>students who take gender and sexuality<br>studies love the way that this paper<br>makes them think differently about the<br>world around them and about their<br>day-to-day lives<br>we have fascinating classroom<br>discussions and everyone does a project<br>that involves putting some of their new<br>ideas their learning into practice in<br>in the school of social sciences you can<br>also do degrees in sociology or social<br>policy<br>studying sociology at waikato you will<br>learn about how societies work and<br>you'll have the chance to talk about all<br>kinds of social issues with other<br>students and the relaxed and interactive<br>learning environment<br>in sociology we are interested in how<br>social justice issues<br>work as well as understanding the<br>structure of society<br>we focus on thematic areas such as<br>criminology popular culture activism and<br>social change<br>we also teach papers on globalization<br>and on the body and embodiment for<br>example<br>if you choose to study social policy<br>you'll learn about how policy making<br>affects everyone across age gender and<br>culture<br>and you'll learn how to influence policy<br>students who study with us love social<br>policy because they get to debate how<br>social problems arise and what can be<br>done to address those problems<br>studying social policy opens up a wide<br>range of job possibilities for students<br>whether you're interested in working for<br>government agencies or voluntary or<br>community organizations for example<br>i suggest that you check out the social<br>policy papers we teach<br>on topics like health<br>welfare the family<br>or our papers on addressing precarity<br>if you join us studying whether you<br>choose to study sociology social policy<br>or gender and sexuality studies or any<br>combination of these you will consider<br>how different groups in society view<br>social reality and you'll consider how<br>we look forward to meeting you on your<br>journey through study at the university</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
