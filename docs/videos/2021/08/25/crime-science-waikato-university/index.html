ora<br>my name's lisa thompson and i'm a senior<br>lecturer in crime science um i just want<br>to spend the next few minutes telling<br>you a little bit more about crime<br>science and how you can learn more about<br>it in the papers that we offer<br>so our starting point really on crime<br>science is to consider the criminal<br>justice system as a failed experiment to<br>control crime<br>it in some cases it may punish people<br>but it doesn't serve as an effective<br>deterrent<br>so for example this um chart here uh<br>beneath me um this shows the 24 month<br>reimprison rate of australasian<br>offenders released between 2013 and<br>2015.<br>and we can see that you know the rates<br>of reoffending and re-imprisonment are<br>really high across the across the board<br>and if we bear in mind that only a very<br>small proportion of offenders go to<br>prison we can take from that that the<br>reoffending rates are likely much higher<br>than this chart shows<br>and similarly<br>in ottawa new zealand mari have<br>particularly been failed by the criminal<br>justice system<br>despite making up less than a fifth of<br>the population in new zealand they they<br>comprise over half of all uh the people<br>in prison so you can see that there's a<br>huge disparity there<br>so our mission very much is about aiming<br>to reduce crime and increase security<br>and safety of all citizens through<br>multidisciplinary evidence-based<br>research and that's really kind of the<br>crux of what we do<br>firstly we're multi-disciplined because<br>um we cannot just solve um the the 21st<br>century world's um crime problems with<br>just one discipline alone so to take an<br>example cyber crime is one of the<br>fastest growing crimes you may have been<br>affected by it yourself um and<br>firstly it's unlikely that we will ever<br>identify the offenders let alone process<br>them through the criminal justice system<br>so you know criminal justice system is<br>completely redundant there but second of<br>all um<br>to to to create um effective solutions<br>to prevent cyber crime we need to start<br>pulling uh the talents the knowledge the<br>expertise from different disciplines so<br>in cyber crime we sometimes well we<br>often need computer scientists but we<br>also working alongside them we need<br>behavioral um psychologists as well<br>people who understand the types of<br>behavior um that online criminals use um<br>and also we<br>draw from engineering a lot because<br>they're very problem focused and they're<br>about designing solutions so we often<br>work with engineers to think about how<br>can we engineer a safer society and you<br>can do that in all sorts of ways<br>depending on what the crime problem is<br>and we we are very much evidence based<br>and that is that we believe in using<br>data we believe in using um looking for<br>patterns and trends across data and<br>using that evidence to inform how we go<br>about devising solutions and kind of<br>remedies to crime<br>so ultimately we are very unapologetic<br>that we're very outcome focused we what<br>we primarily care about is reducing<br>crime and as a natural consequence<br>reducing victimization which can be a<br>huge um<br>negative impact on people's quality of<br>lives<br>and from 2021 students starting<br>undergraduate degrees at the university<br>of waikato can take them the minor in<br>crime science alongside any other major<br>so for example a popular kind of<br>combination is a psychology major and a<br>crime science minor<br>and i just want to take this opportunity<br>to let you know about a couple of the<br>papers that we've got on offer and in<br>trimester a so the first one is christ<br>eye<br>101 this is very much our capstone paper<br>where we introduce students to the three<br>pillars of crime science and they are<br>the fact that we are all about reducing<br>crime um the fact that we we teach and<br>we train students to think like<br>scientists and we bring disciplines<br>together like i previously said and<br>throughout that paper we also weave in<br>lots of discussions about the ethical<br>and moral dilemmas um associated with<br>different technology that is used to<br>reduce crime<br>uh the second year paper christ sci 201<br>is known as understanding the crime<br>event now it's been established through<br>decades of research that crime is<br>patterned in quite predictable ways so<br>it clusters in time and it clusters in<br>space and it clusters also according to<br>other types of dimensions as well it<br>happens to be that if you can predict<br>something you can prevent it so we're<br>very much focused on patterns and<br>looking at patterns in data and so this<br>paper very much introduces students to<br>how to start exploring patterns in data<br>how to think about them they're gonna<br>students will get a hands-on experience<br>about how to sort of you know visualize<br>crime data in um crime mapping software<br>and also thinking about other types of<br>patterns that can come out data<br>and it's really really interesting<br>and i'll be taking that that paper so if<br>you're interested just go and have a<br>hello i'm professor devin palashik and<br>i'm the director of the new zealand<br>institute of security and crime science<br>here at the university of waikato<br>i really hope you're enjoying the<br>virtual open day so far i'm really<br>excited to tell you about two new<br>subjects that you can study at the<br>university<br>and they are forensic psychology and<br>crime science<br>both of them are taught by staff in our<br>institute along with other academics<br>across the university who are all<br>experts in their fields<br>we're the only university in new zealand<br>to offer of each either of these two new<br>subjects as minors and from 2022<br>you can study them alongside other<br>subjects you may be thinking about<br>majoring in such as psychology or social<br>sciences for instance or computer<br>science perhaps<br>i'm going to tell you first about<br>forensic psychology and then my recently<br>appointed colleague dr lisa thompson<br>formerly from the gildando institute at<br>university college london where crime<br>science was born we'll tell you a bit<br>so forensic psychology<br>is the intersection between these three<br>different systems<br>in fact it's mostly about people and<br>systems which is quite in contrast to<br>crime science as you'll learn shortly<br>so we have psychology the science of the<br>mind and human behavior<br>the legal system which sets the terms<br>for how we should behave and<br>particularly what will happen if we<br>here are some typical forensic<br>psychology questions that show how<br>interesting this subject is<br>why is it that some children end up in a<br>life of crime and others don't<br>do people really confess sometimes to<br>things they haven't done the answer to<br>that is definitely yes and the<br>circumstances in which that happens are<br>quite interesting<br>what is psychopathy something that<br>fascinates a lot of people and that i<br>personally know quite a lot about<br>do we do profiling in new zealand<br>i get asked that really often and the<br>answer is not really in the way that<br>they do with the fbi and mind hunter for<br>instance or the way that it's portrayed<br>on csi and other crime shows<br>so you might have to go overseas if<br>you're thinking about that as a career<br>what makes eyewitness evidence so<br>inaccurate doesn't matter of course it<br>does what are the circumstances where it<br>can be better or poorer<br>how do we know if someone was insane<br>when they did their crime<br>how and when does rehabilitation help<br>people we know quite a lot about when<br>it's effective and when it's not and why<br>that is<br>why are more than half of our prisoners<br>maori this is a very topical kind of<br>topic at the moment is it simply that<br>judges or<br>the probation service are not as fair<br>with them or is it much more elaborate<br>than that with complex<br>causes coming in from multiple sources<br>and lastly here does restorative justice<br>work<br>so next year we'll be offering these two<br>papers if psyc101 introduction to<br>forensic psychology which covers a wide<br>range of topics and then also f psych<br>201 for people going into their second<br>year of study which looks more<br>specifically at psychology and crime<br>and then from 2023 we'll have a third<br>year paper as well in correctional<br>psychological practice<br>so if you're starting university next<br>year by the time you get to your third<br>year of study you'll be able to complete<br>60 points that form a subspecialty in<br>forensic psychology in your degree<br>and one that will make you more<br>employable if you're going on to work in<br>the myriad places across the justice<br>sector where these kinds of knowledge<br>and skills are needed<br>i'd also just like to note that as many<br>of you know maori in particular have<br>often not been well heard or well served<br>by the criminal justice system<br>and are therefore disproportionately<br>caught up in many parts of that system<br>so all of these papers go some way to<br>equipping you with an understanding of<br>the issues challenges and controversies<br>there both from mighty and non-maori<br>perspectives and again these things are<br>increasingly important for employers<br>so what is a minor you might be<br>wondering a minor is effectively four<br>papers which typically include<br>two first-year papers and then a second<br>in the third year paper and i've spoken<br>about three of them<br>already the other first year paper that<br>you'd need to take if you were doing<br>this as a minor can be from a number of<br>different options from psychology and<br>social sciences<br>so why do a minor in forensic psychology<br>well first off it's just a really<br>interesting topic i feel very lucky to<br>have had this topic at the centre of my<br>career for all of it because it's so<br>fascinating and i still think that today<br>so just doing a paper as an elective is<br>a great idea but also you can learn<br>skills that are useful in other areas as<br>well<br>and it will employ your it will increase<br>your employability right across the</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
