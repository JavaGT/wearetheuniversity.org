hello my name is alex<br>o'reilly and i am based in the<br>international office at the university<br>of waikato<br>it is my pleasure to welcome you here<br>today to our virtual open day<br>this session is specifically designed<br>for students who are currently in new<br>zealand and who may be finishing their<br>high school studies and are looking for<br>the next step in their study journey<br>we do have a dedicated session for our<br>online students if you happen to be<br>located outside of new zealand so please<br>check out our virtual open day webpage<br>for a link to that recording session<br>we hope that you will enjoy what we have<br>to talk about in the session which<br>includes what is life like at the<br>university of waikato what are some of<br>our key and popular programs that we<br>have on offer<br>as well as our general student support<br>services and teaching and learning<br>facilities<br>this is your opportunity to ask us<br>any questions that you may have so<br>please feel free to pop your questions<br>in throughout the session and we will<br>answer them as we go along<br>we really hope you enjoy today's session<br>as well as the other sessions we have on<br>offer as part of our virtual open day<br>so first i wanted to set the scene now i<br>know you are already based here in new<br>zealand and you're probably very aware<br>of some of the fantastic selling points<br>that we have in terms of a really safe<br>welcoming and multicultural<br>community<br>however i really wanted to mention about<br>the high quality education system that<br>we have here in new zealand<br>if you follow the qs university rankings<br>closely<br>you will know that all eight new zealand<br>universities are ranked in the top 500<br>in the world<br>this is not an easy feat but it is an<br>example of the top quality education and<br>world-renowned academics and teaching<br>staff that we attract from across the<br>globe<br>of course as a student who completes a<br>minimum of a bachelor degree<br>qualification<br>at a university you will be eligible for<br>a three-year post study work visa<br>following your graduation so if you are<br>intending to look for a long-term work<br>opportunities in new zealand that's a<br>great pathway to that<br>and of course we enjoy a really easy<br>going lifestyle here in new zealand so<br>we have beautiful<br>outdoor setting that we like to<br>encourage our students<br>and staff to take advantage of so<br>there's really lots of opportunity for<br>you to enjoy a great study and life<br>balance<br>employability is always a strong point<br>of discussion and something that we<br>really like to focus on as part of your<br>journey to becoming a student but also<br>understanding what you would like to do<br>after you complete your studies now you<br>may think that<br>that is a long time away<br>you know you think of undertaking your<br>first degree at a university which is<br>generally three years in total and some<br>of you may be thinking about<br>postgraduate study which is study that<br>you complete following your first degree<br>or your bachelor's degree at a<br>university but it is a really important<br>point to focus on<br>and think about what job or career you<br>might like to move into when you finish<br>your study<br>so in terms of providing some<br>information for you in a new zealand<br>context<br>we have a very strong economy<br>and employment across multiple<br>industries is projected to steadily<br>increase over the next few years<br>now we look at a number of different<br>sources<br>when we are providing advice to you as a<br>student and one of those key sources<br>is the<br>skills shortage list which is provided<br>by immigration new zealand<br>within that there are key industries<br>identified as having opportunities for<br>a strong career growth<br>in the coming years and at the moment<br>those areas are identified as<br>construction<br>engineering<br>purchasing and supply<br>health and social services<br>ict<br>or computer science and science<br>so if you are interested in any of those<br>uh areas then we will<br>look at study opportunities to help you<br>move into those careers and it's just a<br>good reassurance that<br>when you get your world-class<br>qualification from the university of<br>waikato you can be relatively confident<br>that there will be a number of different<br>roles within that industry ready for you<br>of course um there is opportunities for<br>you to stay in new zealand and work and<br>that is provided through the post-study<br>work pathway<br>and as mentioned before if you complete<br>a minimum of a bachelor degree<br>or a master's degree which is a<br>postgraduate qualification you will be<br>eligible for a three-year post-study<br>work visa which enables you to work<br>in new zealand and the idea is that<br>while you<br>may enter into<br>you know kind of an entry level role<br>when you first graduate within those<br>three years you would move into<br>a position that is directly related to<br>your degree<br>and of course if you are looking for<br>a further study<br>following completion of your three-year<br>post-study work visa and you came back<br>to study at a university<br>if you study a graduate diploma which is<br>a one-year qualification you would be<br>eligible for a further one-year<br>as i mentioned before we have a number<br>of tools<br>that we use when we support our<br>conversations with students about<br>what<br>industries are either experiencing a<br>shortage<br>or there are opportunities for growth in<br>the future<br>and one of these tools is um designed by<br>mbie it's a government organization in<br>new zealand<br>and it is the occupation outlook tool<br>now this is available both on<br>line on a website but also available as<br>a downloadable app so have a look out<br>for that<br>um<br>through through your phone<br>ability but the occupation outlook tool<br>is um an indicator of not only industry<br>opportunities<br>but also gives you an idea of the income<br>that you would receive<br>as part of that industry so there's<br>three<br>primary indicators through this tool<br>the first being<br>the level of income that you would<br>receive obviously<br>the minus<br>indicates less and the plus indicates<br>more<br>and the fees that you would expect to<br>pay when you are studying<br>and then the job prospects so three<br>examples we have included here<br>for engineering software and accountants<br>you can see that the job prospects are<br>as high as possible across the<br>industries available here in new zealand<br>so that is just another<br>piece of information to take into<br>account when you are thinking about what<br>to study if your intention is to stay<br>now for those of you who may be based<br>outside<br>of the university<br>region i wanted to set the scene<br>and tell you a little bit more about our<br>beautiful cities<br>so the first city and the main city<br>campus is hamilton<br>it is the fourth largest city in new<br>zealand and due to our proximity to<br>auckland it is growing very very fast so<br>if you do happen to travel<br>to hamilton or if you live in hamilton<br>you will see the number of economic<br>developments that are being undertaken<br>this includes new expressways so<br>transport we have<br>a new freight and logistics hub<br>so<br>that is going to be a 20-year project<br>that will bring<br>tens of thousands of jobs to the<br>area and we're also the center for<br>advanced manufacturing and agri-business<br>you may or may not know<br>but we are the host of a global event<br>called the field days<br>and this is a platform which allows<br>businesses to showcase cutting edge<br>technology and innovation and it's also<br>the largest<br>agricultural<br>event of its kind in new zealand<br>um sorry actually in the southern<br>hemisphere so again it's a really<br>important part of our region agriculture<br>it's an important part of our export<br>industry within new zealand and we have<br>a number of different businesses that<br>are based here<br>in the waikato region which hamilton is<br>based within<br>we're also home to leading science and<br>research facilities<br>so another example is we have a company<br>called gallaghers<br>they have their head office in hamilton<br>and they are a global leader in their<br>field<br>they invented the<br>electric fence which is commonly used in<br>the agricultural industry<br>and the pentagon<br>in the us uses their security systems<br>so that's a great example of kiwi<br>ingenuity having a global impact<br>hamilton has one of the highest ratios<br>of scientists per capita<br>in the whole world so if you are<br>interested in science you can be<br>relatively confident that there is a<br>very strong and growing industry here in<br>hamilton<br>and we also have the largest teaching<br>hospital<br>in the southern hemisphere so for those<br>of you who are interested in health<br>sciences or<br>nursing in a postgraduate capacity you<br>can be reassured that there is the<br>just a quick snapshot<br>of hamilton city as you can see it's<br>it's a stunning city um it's very green<br>it's very open we have a beautiful river<br>running through the center which is the<br>waikato river<br>you also know we are the university of<br>waikato so we have strong links<br>to the land<br>and it's a very open space and very<br>comfortable city so there's a lot going<br>for it<br>has everything that you need and it's<br>it's really comfortable for day-to-day<br>living<br>for not only students but also families<br>and and for businesses alike<br>and here is a picture of our campus um<br>in hamilton again you will see<br>it is very large we have the largest<br>campus in new zealand it is 65 hectares<br>in total<br>and that is because we have a number of<br>open spaces so<br>multiple green sports fields we have<br>three lakes on campus<br>and we have all of our teaching<br>learning and student support facilities<br>located in one location so it's a very<br>comprehensive and safe and culturally<br>so our second campus is located in<br>tauranga city<br>now this is located on the east coast<br>uh of new zealand<br>and the taranga city campus is about 1.5<br>hours drive from our hamilton campus<br>so they are very closely related um in<br>terms of their location and also of the<br>study opportunities that are available<br>so most of our popular programs at both<br>the undergraduate and postgraduate level<br>are available at tauranga<br>it is the fifth largest city in new<br>zealand and it is the fastest growing<br>city in new zealand<br>so that means again that not only is<br>there a really diverse and multicultural<br>population<br>but there are a number of industries<br>that are experiencing significant growth<br>a few examples of industries that are<br>doing really well<br>um it is a world-class producer of<br>plant-based foods and that is a<br>testament<br>to the beautiful climate<br>that is available in this region so<br>kiwi fruit which you'll be familiar with<br>95<br>of exports for new zealand are growing<br>in the region where tauranga city is<br>based which is quite um significant and<br>impressive<br>and of course avocado and honey<br>two other um highly popular popular<br>export products are also predominantly<br>growing in this region<br>other leading industries include<br>horticultural technologies so again that<br>is linking back to those plant-based<br>foods<br>marine biotechnology so if you're<br>interested in marine science<br>or conservation or ecology<br>maybe consider taranga as your study<br>destination<br>and also tourism and education so a<br>growing population<br>beautiful population of<br>landscapes and this links to high<br>tourism and also a number of education<br>providers being based<br>in the city<br>it is home to new zealand's largest<br>commercial seaport um again because we<br>export so many of our products<br>globally<br>so even larger than the port that is<br>based in auckland to put that into<br>perspective<br>and for those of you who are more<br>culturally attuned um the national jazz<br>festival is held in taranga which is the<br>longest running event of its kind in the<br>southern hemisphere<br>so this is a aerial view<br>of the city as you can see it's a<br>fantastic<br>coastline city<br>very beautiful and stunning landscape<br>and again a really great place to be to<br>balance both your study<br>and your<br>life<br>in a quick snippet<br>of our tarounga campus this is a campus<br>that was opened only in<br>2019<br>so when you visit<br>it's absolutely stunning the facilities<br>are world-class<br>there's a really fantastic culture and<br>student vibe<br>and a number of<br>different facilities are available<br>really close by to the campus it is<br>based right in the heart of the cbd<br>so really easy just to walk to a number<br>of different shopping centres and cafes<br>if you were to take a break from your<br>study<br>one of our key selling points of the<br>university and something that it's<br>really important to think about is<br>practical opportunities while you are a<br>student<br>now a lot of people have the<br>understanding that university is all<br>about being in a classroom and it's you<br>know you read lots of textbooks and<br>you're encouraged to write lots of notes<br>and yes that is absolutely an element of<br>university but not many people<br>understand how it prepares you in a<br>practical way<br>so our programs are designed to deliver<br>global graduates so people that are<br>ready to solve world problems and this<br>may be that you're based in new zealand<br>solving these problems but a lot of the<br>time our students venture out<br>into a number of different roles across<br>the world and that is what we love to<br>see we love to see our alumni<br>making an impact in different<br>organizations and in different<br>challenging environments<br>we are based on a critical thinking<br>model<br>so it's quite um<br>realistic for you to<br>encourage<br>uh or challenge conversation with your<br>lecturer or your tutor we always want<br>you to ask questions we want you to be<br>confident to<br>read different pieces of work or ask<br>questions for your own understanding and<br>that's something that we really actively<br>encourage<br>but most importantly<br>industry is really closely connected so<br>we have a work integrated learning<br>program uh which is compulsory for most<br>of our program that you may study<br>and we also have a number of different<br>opportunities for both internships and<br>work placements and we have staff<br>dedicated in these areas to help support<br>you for your work integrated learning<br>programs<br>to support that we offer a number of<br>on-campus events<br>we have a dedicated career development<br>services and they host<br>different<br>days such as careers open days<br>industry speed dating<br>and then we have a number of workshops<br>as well that's designed to prepare you<br>as a graduate to<br>look for job opportunities but also to<br>apply and be prepared for when you get<br>to interview stage so there's a lot of<br>different support mechanisms in place to<br>give you and build your relationships<br>with industry before you finish your<br>study<br>and we also have a unique program called<br>the employability plus program and this<br>provides you<br>as a student with valuable volunteer<br>experience so again establishing<br>relationships between yourself and the<br>industry through a voluntary role and<br>this is something that is recognized<br>when you graduate and is listed on your<br>transcript<br>just quickly i wanted to uh set the<br>scene about some different items that<br>you should take into account when you<br>are thinking about choosing a university<br>a lot of people<br>naturally are drawn towards what's the<br>ranking of that university and that sets<br>um sets them up for<br>um<br>you know<br>you're thinking about what what that may<br>mean for you as a student<br>but think about a number of other items<br>that are also important while you are a<br>student this includes your employability<br>when you graduate<br>what internships or practical<br>experiences available<br>do i have<br>the opportunity to study globally at<br>another university while i'm completing<br>my studies with waikato<br>what financial incentives or<br>scholarships are available to me<br>and what accommodation options are there<br>do i want to live on campus do i want to<br>live off campus what is going to create<br>to<br>provide you with a bit more information<br>about the qs world rankings because this<br>is something that you may hear<br>spoken about quite regularly but you may<br>not actually understand how a qs ranking<br>comes to be<br>so for your understanding<br>there are six indicators of performance<br>that make up a university's ranking in<br>the qs spectrum<br>academic reputation<br>citations<br>student-to-staff ratio<br>employer reputation<br>international faculty ratio and<br>international student ratio<br>and those six indicators all carry<br>varying weights so you can see academic<br>reputation for example<br>contributes to 40 percent of the<br>university's total ranking<br>what it does not mean<br>is<br>what quality of teaching<br>what quality of student support pastoral<br>care<br>or individual rankings within your<br>subject choice they're not<br>incorporated in that u.s world<br>university ranking<br>so just think about what is actually<br>important to you<br>what is important for your student<br>journey and your graduation journey<br>and please do your research ask<br>questions get in contact<br>visit the university and its staff and<br>really try and get a true sense of<br>whether a university is the right fit<br>for you and what is important to you as<br>to provide you with a summary of the<br>university of waikato rankings we are<br>ranked at number<br>373 out of the world's best 1300<br>universities<br>so we are not doing too bad when you<br>think about<br>new zealand having eight universities in<br>total<br>versus the number of universities that<br>are available globally<br>importantly<br>we hold the triple crown accredited<br>management school<br>and this is an accreditation that we<br>have held for the longest period of time<br>across all new zealand universities and<br>this places us in the top 1<br>of the world<br>although all of our qualifications are<br>globally recognized<br>if you graduate from waikato management<br>school you can graduate knowing that you<br>carry that triple crown accreditation<br>that gives you a real sense of value<br>alongside your graduation certificate<br>we have a number of globally ranked<br>subject areas across<br>multiple faculties and you can see uh<br>they are listed there and we continue to<br>um have a number of of strengths um and<br>and these rankings continually<br>strengthen um as as the rankings are<br>released each year<br>what i wanted to point back to from my<br>from before was just understanding what<br>is important to you as a student<br>we continually engage with our students<br>to understand<br>how we are doing as a university and and<br>what improvements we could make<br>and we are really happy to know that 93<br>of our students are completely satisfied<br>in all areas of the student experience<br>so just some quick facts about the<br>university of waikato<br>in general we have over 13 000 students<br>which includes over two and a half<br>thousand international students<br>so the great thing is that there are<br>many like-minded students students from<br>uh backgrounds that may be similar to<br>yourself or backgrounds that are vastly<br>dissimilar to yourself but you know that<br>there's a really strong international<br>community at the university<br>and we have dedicated academic support<br>and pastoral care services for our<br>international students<br>so not only is that within your<br>dedicated faculty<br>but also generally as well so we have an<br>international student support office<br>that is there to support you through<br>both any academic challenges or any<br>personal challenges that you may<br>experience<br>our facilities and programs are<br>absolutely world class and we are renown<br>for our expertise in a few particular<br>areas<br>i won't go through these in significant<br>detail but you can see that there is an<br>extensive list<br>of world-class facilities at the<br>university<br>um something that is of really<br>impressive note as we have the largest<br>supercomputer across new zealand<br>we have a cyber security and artificial<br>intelligence<br>dedicated<br>expertise unit so if you are interested<br>in<br>cyber security or computer science we<br>are and have attracted world leaders in<br>this space<br>we have a specialized coastal marine<br>field station so as i mentioned before<br>if you're interested in the environment<br>or marine science and that will give you<br>practical opportunities to look at<br>conservation um in the new zealand<br>environment and ensuring that our waters<br>are in a good position for the years to<br>come if you are interested in musical<br>performance we have a purpose-built<br>concert chamber and performance spaces<br>that have acoustics that are globally<br>renowned and have been<br>tuned to perfection so we have a number<br>of leading uh tutors in the music and<br>performance space<br>for those of you who are interested in<br>the olympic games which was very<br>exciting for us here in new zealand to<br>see our athletes<br>accumulate a number of of medals a<br>number of our olympic athletes trained<br>at our university of waikato adams<br>center for high performance so that's<br>again a testament of the world-class<br>facilities you will have access to as a<br>student<br>as i mentioned before<br>we have a work integrated learning<br>program and all of our undergraduate<br>programs<br>will require students to complete this<br>which is an opportunity for internship<br>and practical experience and a number of<br>our postgraduate programs<br>include this experience as well so<br>connecting you with industry as much as<br>possible<br>and of course if you are interested in<br>uh seeing what opportunities lay abroad<br>we have global partnerships with a<br>significant number of universities if<br>you are seeing what it's like to study<br>abroad and go on<br>an exchange which is normally between<br>six months to one year of your total<br>study time<br>if you are interested in cost and which<br>is usually a significant factor<br>study in new zealand is cheaper<br>than in many other countries and also<br>the living costs in the two cities<br>hamilton and taranga where the<br>university is based is significantly<br>cheaper than a number of other cities<br>not only in new zealand but also<br>so this is just a quick overview of our<br>faculties and schools of study you can<br>see we cater for<br>almost every area<br>in terms of subject offerings and we do<br>have a number of international students<br>within<br>all of our schools<br>and faculty so again you can be quite<br>confident that you will be joining other<br>students<br>not only kiwi students but also a number<br>of international students as well and<br>that creates a really comprehensive and<br>balanced<br>so now i will move into some of our<br>popular undergraduate programs<br>there is obviously a full list available<br>on our website but again if you have any<br>questions about your area of study if i<br>don't cover it today then please feel<br>free to pop it in the q a<br>so the bachelor of arts is a three-year<br>degree<br>it is a significantly flexible program<br>so you can see in the table below that<br>there are a significant number of majors<br>that are available<br>and this means that the faculties that<br>offer this degree are quite varied so<br>you could study within the faculty of<br>arts in social sciences<br>the faculty of maori and indigenous<br>studies<br>or the faculty

also<br>nationally as well and when borders are<br>open there are a number of global<br>opportunities available to you<br>so if you are interested in culture<br>in the humanities in languages or

projects<br>with businesses<br>but you do get that<br>distinct workplace internship in the<br>third year of your qualification so that<br>is one day per week<br>over the trimester<br>again there are a number of different<br>majors available within the business<br>fundamental areas<br>if you are interested in accounting and<br>becoming a chartered accountant<br>then you will qualify with nine

research<br>rankings<br>if you are interested in a<br>higher level qualification but within<br>the same subject areas we do also have a<br>bachelor of management studies<br>available as a

degree<br>this is available in both march and july<br>and there are<br>two specified programs available so data<br>analytics<br>and embedded systems<br>now this qualification is designed to<br>cover a wide range of core computer<br>science topics<br>and technologies now this is across a<br>number of different user faces including<br>web<br>mobile cyber security networks databases<br>algorithms and the user experience<br>we know that this will be a<br>area of significant growth for us<br>in terms of<br>industry roles that are available and we<br>expect this qualification to become more<br>and

opportunities should you<br>all right we are moving into the<br>scholarship space and<br>um you can see there is a lot of detail<br>here so i will try to<br>keep my<br>speaking to<br>a minimum as as possible<br>so we do offer a number of different<br>scholarships for you<br>as an international student and we're<br>really excited to be offering these um<br>in spite of the the current environment<br>where new zealand borders unfortunately<br>remain closed<br>so<br>the first scholarship<br>that i would like to mention<br>for you being based here in new zealand<br>is our onshore fee reduction<br>this is available to you as a new<br>onshore student<br>and you will be eligible for a 20<br>discount for your first one year of<br>onshore study<br>this is an ongoing<br>fee reduction you do not need to apply<br>for it it is automatically applied to<br>you<br>through the<br>enrollment process at the university<br>there are also a number of other<br>scholarships available for example as a<br>school leaver<br>you will be eligible for the<br>international entrance scholarship for<br>school leavers<br>now the great thing about this is this<br>is a very generous scholarship it is<br>a 10 000<br>tuition fee reduction<br>as you will note in the closing date<br>column it will again be automatically<br>applied for you when you apply to the<br>university so as a new zealand school<br>leaver when you submit your application<br>to the university you will be eligible<br>for a tuition fee reduction<br>provided you are<br>enrolling for the first time in a<br>bachelor degree and successfully meet<br>university entrance<br>if you are a high achiever<br>and you receive<br>ncea level 3 with a merit or excellence<br>endorsement<br>we have further scholarships available<br>to you which will be available in the<br>second and third year of your study so<br>something to keep in mind um as you are<br>finishing your studies at a new zealand<br>high school and just something to<br>work really hard towards to to have that<br>extra scholarship available to you<br>we also have<br>a number of scholarships<br>available if you are a current<br>international students so<br>for those of you who are onshore you're<br>probably new to the university but when<br>you do progress into your second year if<br>you are able to maintain a b plus grade<br>average you will be eligible for a<br>tuition fee reduction<br>and if for some reason you unfortunately<br>do not meet university entrant<br>requirements<br>and you decide to study in our pathways<br>college<br>you will also be<br>eligible for a foundation or<br>international diploma scholarship so<br>that's something that is really exciting<br>so lots of different opportunities for<br>you we do have really detailed<br>information available on our website<br>but again if you have any questions<br>so just i briefly touched on it then but<br>we are really<br>fortunate to have the university of<br>waikato college<br>located at our university main campus in<br>hamilton so as i mentioned before this<br>college provides our pathways programs<br>so if you do need any additional<br>academic preparation or english language<br>preparation before you move to your<br>bachelor degree study then this is<br>absolutely an option available to you<br>so students who<br>progress<br>from the college will be guaranteed<br>entry to most degrees upon successful<br>completion of their pathways program<br>the college is there to support you<br>to not only develop your subject<br>knowledge and skills<br>but also to help you become more<br>confident with university life we know<br>it's a really big transition from high<br>school to university and sometimes you<br>just need to gain a little bit more<br>confidence and this is what college<br>staff are really fantastic in doing<br>there is an opportunity to mix with<br>domestic students<br>to improve your english<br>and make local friends so you will study<br>alongside domestic students<br>if you are in those academic preparation<br>classes<br>and the most important thing is that<br>you're immersed in university life from<br>day one<br>you will have access to all of the same<br>facilities and support services as<br>degree level students<br>so what can you study at the university<br>of waikato college well we have a number<br>of programs available to you whether you<br>need some academic preparation<br>or english language preparation<br>so within our foundation programs we<br>have one<br>and two trimester foundation studies<br>this is for students who may need<br>english language support as well as<br>specific subject preparation<br>and we also have our certificate of<br>university preparation which is one<br>trimester in total and use usually for<br>those students who have met literacy<br>requirements<br>our international diplomas are brand new<br>products and really really excited to be<br>able to offer these<br>to our international students<br>they are three trimesters in total and<br>we offer our diplomas in business and<br>computer science<br>and upon successful completion of your<br>three trimesters you will progress into<br>year two<br>of your chosen bachelor degree<br>so this means that although you may not<br>meet university insurance requirements<br>if you meet the requirements for our<br>international diploma<br>you will still finish your bachelor<br>degree<br>within the same amount of time as if you<br>had started your bachelor degree<br>directly so that's a fantastic option<br>for you if you are perhaps a little bit<br>worried about whether you will be<br>admitted to the university directly<br>for that um there are options available<br>within the bachelor of business bachelor<br>of science or bachelor of computer<br>science so they they are the three<br>qualifications that you can progress<br>into upon successful completion<br>and of course we have our academic<br>english program<br>uh the certificate of attainment in<br>english language and that is offered<br>across multiple levels and that will<br>progress you either into a foundation or<br>diploma<br>or<br>probably more likely a degree level<br>study<br>for more information for our programs<br>that are offered at the college please<br>and finally the last topic that i wanted<br>to cover<br>were just a slight introduction to our<br>halls of residence<br>a special note that we provide<br>guaranteed accommodation for<br>international students so regardless of<br>whether you choose to live on campus<br>or you would like to take advantage of<br>one of our off-campus offerings such as<br>homestay<br>we have a support team ready to help you<br>um and we will guarantee your<br>accommodation<br>while you are a student of ours<br>so there are two options in terms of the<br>halls of residence we have both catered<br>and self-catered halls<br>the difference between the two<br>for catered is that all of your meals<br>will be provided so three meals a day<br>seven days a week<br>uh whereas self-catered you will have<br>the facilities available to you to cook<br>your own meals<br>you will always have a private bedroom<br>you will never share a bedroom with<br>another student<br>however you will share a general<br>facility such as our bathroom and living<br>area<br>for our international students most do<br>choose self-catered<br>but particularly for our school leavers<br>it's really nice to kind of settle into<br>university life in that first year and<br>so most of our school leavers domestic<br>or international do choose the catered<br>halls option but it's up to you<br>and completely for your own individual<br>preference<br>and this is just a quick snapshot of the<br>associated costs for our halls of<br>residence so you have the fully catered<br>uh cost per week so again all of your<br>meals are provided and all of the<br>utility bills<br>are covered within this<br>price<br>and then we have the self-catered option<br>uh so food would be in addition to that<br>and at the expense of you as a student<br>and then you can see we do uh offer um a<br>number of activities and support<br>services<br>um which is uh not only activities on<br>campus but also off-campus as well so<br>for example<br>um<br>you and and your your fellow students<br>may go bowling or you may go to the<br>movies or you may go to a local beach or<br>um you may head down to the mountain for<br>a ski trip so there is<br>that associated activity fee but um<br>there is absolutely opportunity for you<br>to<br>um engage and meet lots of different<br>people while you are living at the halls<br>of residence<br>and you can see the different types of<br>facilities that are provided of course<br>internet is as fundamental as a student<br>and that is<br>included in in that cost as well so this<br>is just a consideration to weigh up<br>about what type of experience is<br>important to you<br>and whether you want to have that luxury<br>of of meals being provided or if you<br>would prefer to cook for yourself and we<br>also cater to dietary requirements so<br>that is a question<br>that you will be asked when submitting<br>your application so keep an eye out<br>accommodation options are available to<br>apply now and again we have a lot more<br>information including photos and videos<br>on our website<br>so i hope that has provided you with a<br>summary of what life is like at the<br>university of waikato we are very uh<br>welcoming<br>we're multicultural we're diverse but we<br>create a fantastic student community and<br>culture and really prepare you not only<br>for your study journey but also for a<br>number of<br>career opportunities as well<br>our friendly staff are always here to<br>speak with you so if you decide to be<br>shy today and<br>you want to think about some of your<br>questions and get in touch with us<br>please feel free to<br>do so you can see<br>our website<br>information there which will lead you<br>through to<br>some inquiry forms and one of our<br>dedicated international office staff<br>members will be in touch<br>a massive thank you for<br>visiting our virtual open day it was my<br>pleasure<br>to present<br>this information to you today and i wish<br>you all the best with
