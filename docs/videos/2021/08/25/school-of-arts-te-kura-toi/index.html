day<br>presentation about the school of arts or<br>te kura toi my name is gareth shot and<br>i'm the head of school and i'll walk you<br>through some of the programs in the<br>school some of the different majors that<br>we offer different some of the different<br>qualifications that we contribute<br>towards<br>and give you a little bit of advice on<br>what to choose<br>in terms of your study here at waikato<br>so as i said this is the<br>school of arts presentation and of<br>course when you study at waikato you<br>could study a degree and degrees can be<br>sort of taught across a number of<br>different schools so we're divided into<br>schools and i will talk specifically<br>about the programs that are connected to<br>te kura toy and some of the options that<br>you have available to you so regardless<br>of whether you're interested in a<br>program that's in the school of<br>psychology or the faculty of law or the<br>school of social sciences you can<br>combine that with your study of subjects<br>that are based in the school of arts as<br>well so there are plenty options for you<br>as well<br>so as i said i am the head of school and<br>uh i'm under the school of arts or te<br>kura toy we have a number of different<br>programs so we're quite a<br>wide range wide ranging and diverse area<br>so just to take you through these we<br>have international languages and<br>cultures which you can do specialisms in<br>chinese japanese french or spanish now<br>you can take any language at beginners<br>level um and you could do a minor in a<br>language alongside whatever whatever<br>other major you're taking as well but if<br>you take an international languages and<br>cultures degree you can specialize in<br>one of these languages or two languages<br>and you will have a specific pathway<br>through that particular major depending<br>on which language obviously you've<br>chosen to specialize in we would always<br>recommend if you're doing a ba to<br>consider doing a beginner's language<br>paper alongside whatever else you're<br>studying in order to increase your<br>cultural competency and and your fluency<br>um in terms of you know engaging in<br>intercultural communication<br>and we have a number of very broad<br>papers that will help you with that<br>we also have dance and theater that's<br>largely function as one program that<br>specialize obviously in movement uh<br>creativity ideas of creativity and<br>embodiment who do a lot of production<br>based work and a lot of physical base<br>work as well as theory and conceptual<br>work which is really interesting so<br>currently dance and theater contribute<br>to the bachelor of climate change the ba<br>but also they contribute to the bachelor<br>of communication studies in terms of you<br>know um what is creativity and how to be<br>creative as well<br>so again if this is not a major that you<br>plan to take consider some of the papers<br>that they offer in terms of how they<br>would sort of help you in whatever major<br>that you're taking and you know be<br>complement some of your studies<br>then we have english and writing study<br>so english is one program we have a<br>writing studies program that has a<br>specialism in professional writing as<br>well as creative writing and we have a<br>number of really sort of uh amazing um<br>writers uh practitioners who i'll talk a<br>little bit more about later on in the<br>presentation who will<br>help you with your sort of progress and<br>your development as a writer<br>we have a linguistics program as well<br>um and linguistics in particular offer a<br>number of core papers in the ba which<br>are really interesting around the role<br>of language<br>how language changes and over time<br>and obviously how language features uh<br>around the world as well so again really<br>interesting really relevant if you're<br>doing other subjects such as history or<br>geography or anthropology for example we<br>have a music department now we have a<br>bachelor of music where students can<br>actually specialize in classical music<br>in performance and composition<br>but also music also<br>contributes towards the bacteria of<br>communication so if you're interested in<br>music but you want to combine that<br>with graphic design or media studies<br>then the best major for you to consider<br>would be the media production majors<br>part of the bachelor of communication so<br>you can do music alongside two other<br>creative areas as well<br>if you want only do and specialize in<br>music then obviously the bachelor of<br>music is probably the best option for<br>you<br>and last but not least this is my own<br>program that i teach into is the screen<br>and media studies program and again<br>media can be studies and be studied in a<br>number of different ways at waikato it's<br>one of the most flexible topics or areas<br>or subject areas that we have so you can<br>do in combination with graphic design in<br>the media design major as part of the<br>bachelor of design<br>you can also do it in combination with<br>music and graphic design again within<br>the media production majors part of the<br>bachelor of communication you can do a<br>screen and media major in the ba or you<br>can do a screen and media<br>major as part of the b stock size so<br>there are a number of different ways in<br>which you can combine or choose to focus<br>on media or your media studies<br>media is often taken by students who<br>like to do a double major in psychology<br>in the ba um and english is often taken<br>as a double major with students who<br>often take history as part of the ba but<br>those those two subjects are in<br>different schools so you can see how<br>flexible it is even though i'm talking<br>about a single school as part of this<br>presentation<br>so i'm just going to present just give<br>play a little introduction to the school<br>obviously this presentation and that<br>little clip that you just saw seems to<br>suggest that we're all singing and<br>dancing and while we are the school of<br>arts and there is a strong component of<br>what we do is creative and it's<br>performance based<br>we also obviously cater for students<br>with strong sort of scholarly interests<br>as well and we do research alongside<br>alongside performance as well<br>performance-based research so we do both<br>um and but obviously we<br>are very involved in sort of<br>practice-based research and as a result<br>of that we produce a number of<br>performances in theater and dance and<br>music in particular as well as showcases<br>in screen and media<br>as well as performances of creative<br>writing as well<br>so yes we are all singing and dancing<br>but that's not the full story for us<br>and from the images you can see is some<br>of our colleagues<br>performing so you will actually be<br>taught by individuals who are<br>practitioners in their field as well<br>so you will be taught by composers<br>musicians dancers writers and filmmakers<br>and that's one of the strengths of the<br>university of waikato we don't just<br>teach out of a book<br>objectively about things that we've<br>never done ourselves you get taught by<br>people who are living breathing<br>practitioners and<br>sort of community and national leaders<br>and international leaders in their<br>particular fields which is a real<br>strength to the university one of the<br>things that i would urge you to consider<br>when you're thinking about university<br>study is not just look at the subjects<br>that are available but look who's<br>teaching you and you'll find that if you<br>look at waikato and you look at staff<br>profiles that you're being taught by um<br>you know as i said practitioners who<br>actually are professionals in their area<br>and experts in their areas so you're<br>being taught by some of the best and<br>you're being taught by people who are<br>also sort of doing that kind of work<br>alongside the academic work of teaching<br>and research as well which i think is<br>really valuable in this instance<br>so just to extend on that point you will<br>work with award winners<br>awards being awarded for research<br>teaching and for creative practice our<br>authors we have um<br>practicing authors on the writing<br>studies team<br>community leaders so people who have<br>community trusts who involved in<br>community sort of arts projects<br>well-being projects creativity projects<br>as i've said practitioners are you know<br>throughout the school and renowned<br>researchers so<br>we have scholars here who are doing some<br>really innovative uh original work as<br>well and uh you know are internationally<br>renowned for their research<br>contributions as on top of everything<br>else<br>so just to give you an example<br>catherine chichi is you know we're very<br>fortunate to have catherine and also<br>tracy slaughter on the writings study<br>staff who are you know sort of very<br>highly productive award winners and<br>renowned for their writing studies<br>teaching but also their own practice as<br>well so you get to work you know<br>directly with these individuals when you<br>come and study with us<br>just an example of a different kind of<br>award we've got dr kirsten moffat who's<br>recently awarded the national teaching<br>awards so you've got some excellent<br>practitioners in terms of teaching and<br>delivery and knowledge transfer across<br>the school as well<br>and international recognition as well<br>which is really important so when you<br>look at research and when our research<br>is evaluated at universities we get<br>scored on the basis of whether we have<br>national or international profiles and<br>the majority<br>of our researchers have an international<br>standing so they're making contributions<br>to their fields to their disciplines and<br>so here's just an example of dr william<br>jennings who was recently acknowledged<br>for the research that he does so william<br>is part of the french stream as part of<br>international<br>languages and cultures very very unusual<br>for someone outside france to achieve<br>this award so we're very proud of our<br>staff and their achievements<br>we're also very proud of our students<br>and our graduates and even though we're<br>not vocationally based we are involved<br>in the arts in a number of ways we teach<br>critical skills and important<br>transferable skills throughout all our<br>programs<br>and that does not prevent students for<br>them going into the creative industries<br>in a number of different industries and<br>so just an example there you can see<br>lauren's name highlighted which was the<br>uh you know the end credits on the film<br>mortal engines we are industry-facing we<br>do provide students with skills that<br>they can go into industry-based jobs<br>even though we're not vocationally<br>focused and we find that our students<br>have very high creative thinking skills<br>and create creative problem solving<br>skills which enable them to slot into<br>industry-based uh roles quite easily<br>one of the<br>one of the reasons that we're able to do<br>that so well is the resources that we<br>have available to us at the university<br>of waikato we have the academy of<br>performing arts which provides an<br>international level sort of performance<br>space which allows our students to<br>engage in performances throughout their<br>degrees<br>it provides a professional space with<br>professional lighting professional<br>mixing<br>and allows for rather large audiences to<br>attend those performances<br>we also have a function in television<br>studio so students can get to grips with<br>teamwork in uh in a professional sort of<br>studio environment or a professional<br>studio ecology um that where you know<br>everyone has a quite a distinct role<br>and it's not just about making a product<br>but it's about the process involved in<br>making a product and being professional<br>and knowing what those roles means wrote<br>those roles mean sorry<br>so as i said even though this is a<br>presentation for the school of arts uh<br>we actually teach into a number of<br>different qualifications across the<br>university<br>so we teach into the<br>primarily the bachelor of arts but we<br>also teach into the bachelor of<br>communication with two<br>majors a major in media production and a<br>major in creative media we also have a<br>bachelor of music you can also take<br>music as part of the bachelor of arts<br>but also you can take music as part of<br>the bachelor of communication as well if<br>you want to do that in combination with<br>graphic design or media<br>we're part of the bachelor of design<br>which again is a combination between<br>screen and media and graphic design in a<br>major called media design and we're also<br>part of the bachelor of social science<br>so we have subjects like linguistics for<br>example that sit quite sort of<br>comfortably in social science as well as<br>the arts in terms of the links between<br>social linguistics and anthropology and<br>history for example<br>so those two new majors that i've<br>mentioned are part of the bachelor of<br>communication so they're important to<br>highlight because they they haven't been<br>in existence for for very long<br>prior to the bachelor of communication<br>we had the bachelor of communication<br>studies and obviously the current prime<br>minister is one of the graduates of the<br>bachelor of communication studies so<br>we've recently reviewed and relaunched<br>the bachelor of communication we've lost<br>the studies uh part of the the title and<br>with that we've we've introduced new<br>majors the major media production and<br>the major in creative media<br>the major difference between those<br>majors um the media production major is<br>about people who want to execute<br>different creative practices so people<br>who are interested in sounding to be<br>sound engineers or to be interested in<br>film production or part of the the<br>design team<br>um and so they implement<br>uh creative ideas<br>as part of a team so if you just think<br>about peter jackson and lord of the<br>rings he didn't do everything himself he<br>had teams of people he had graphic<br>designers he had editors he had you know<br>lighting people cinematographers so the<br>major media production is about the<br>people who do those nuts and bolts jobs<br>that make those really interesting<br>projects work on a large scale<br>whereas the major in creative media is<br>more about what what is creativity how<br>do you develop a creative vision how do<br>you creatively<br>problem solve and how do you express<br>that creative idea so it's really for<br>people who have to produce creative<br>responses to you know interesting<br>problems really<br>and that incorporates writing<br>incorporates media incorporates graphic<br>design and it incorporates music so lots<br>of different production options in terms<br>so with us if you come and study with us<br>as part of the ba or the bachelor of<br>communication or the bachelor of music<br>or the bachelor of social sciences what<br>you'll get is a very broad base of<br>knowledge with really transferable and<br>flexible skills the idea is not to give<br>you very subject-specific information<br>that will will only last a certain<br>amount of time but to give you real<br>skills in communication and critical<br>thinking and problem solving that you<br>can take with you throughout life and<br>you can apply them<br>throughout life as obviously society and<br>culture changes<br>so you'll get relevant communication<br>creative composition analytical critical<br>social research problem solving and pro<br>and problem performance skills<br>so really skills that you can apply<br>directly in the world in your jobs as<br>soon as you leave and as soon as you<br>graduate from us<br>i hope this has been interesting<br>obviously this is a very broad sweep of<br>what we do and we and please do get in<br>touch with us and make contact with us<br>you can contact me directly or you can<br>contact any of our programs if you have<br>any more questions about what the school<br>of arts can do for you and how it can<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
