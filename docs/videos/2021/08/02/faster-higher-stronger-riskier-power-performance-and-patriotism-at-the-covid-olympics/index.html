evening to share<br>your thoughts and perspectives on the<br>cobin olympics<br>now we're here to<br>have a discussion with our panelists but<br>it's very much we would love to hear<br>from you too from the audience<br>and to bring you into the conversation<br>so please<br>you can use slido and you can add your<br>questions<br>there you can like other people's<br>questions and those<br>might be bumped to the top of the list<br>and i'll try to ask those at the end<br>to our panelists so we can really uh<br>open this up for uh for a<br>but before we kick off the discussion<br>tonight<br>let's start with an old-fashioned poll<br>can we put our hands up everyone put<br>your hands up<br>if you're excited about the tokyo<br>alright looks like majority<br>excitement but some others not so much<br>so we're gonna<br>um maybe a bit of a divided audience<br>which tells me i think we are going to<br>have a good conversation this evening<br>so everyone on the panel this evening<br>either currently<br>is or was an athlete of some<br>form or another and we all know that any<br>good sporting match begins with a warmer<br>so i thought i'd start with torido<br>tonight with a warm-up question<br>what are you most excited for at the<br>tokyo olympics<br>and paralympics now first<br>i want to paint a bit of a brief picture<br>for us all<br>the new zealand um we new zealand<br>suspect uh<br>sent the largest team that we've ever<br>sent to the tokyo olympics with 211<br>athletes<br>representing arturo and 21 sports<br>almost half of those are women and<br>that's just<br>we've got one more female athlete than<br>we had in rio<br>or just over 30 of the new zealand team<br>are maori<br>and the new zealand team also includes<br>28 paralympians across a range of sports<br>including cycling athletics swimming<br>canoe and wheelchair rugby so across<br>this group and the different forms of<br>expertise we have here i'm sure there's<br>lots to be excited about<br>what are you excited about for the tokyo<br>olympics<br>i'm excited for the surfing<br>yeah to watch the surfing in the um<br>skateboarding the new sports<br>um they've been really exciting to watch<br>definitely and<br>just how it would integrate into<br>um i love the lymphatics because it's<br>the one time<br>when we watch um sport that you get to<br>see<br>lots of minority sports that you<br>wouldn't necessarily<br>normally see on at least on the<br>mainstream tv<br>and but women do get really good<br>visibility um<br>we're so used to the sport on tv being<br>dominated by<br>mansport so it's great to see that and<br>i share mihi's excitement about surfing<br>and i think the<br>skateboarding the women's has just been<br>awesome i don't know if you<br>got to see it yesterday three first<br>medals<br>and they were teenagers um and they<br>weren't from the us<br>um people kind of maybe expected that<br>they were going to be dominant so i you<br>know it was like it went in these<br>underdogs<br>the countries that you don't expect and<br>do well<br>do something i guess i'm excited to see<br>if it all goes to pop<br>or not i think i think given that<br>the issues that have preceded the<br>olympics and the paralympic games and<br>the<br>the issues around vaccinations and<br>bubbles and<br>athletes withdrawing from competition<br>and all the various challenges that<br>cover has thrown up as over the last<br>you know year and a half two years yeah<br>i've been just to see if the olympics in<br>the paralympics survive<br>time will tell jesus how about you<br>i sort of got two perspectives i guess<br>i've got that competitive anxiety<br>because we're going to<br>through those have pretty important<br>funds for running<br>and um and i might have a job at the end<br>of it or not<br>there's a competitive anxiety around<br>what excites me a little bit is the<br>conversations that emerge<br>because of all the things that people<br>have been talking about here<br>the dialogue becomes around the social<br>change<br>that the olympics may follow or lead so<br>i think that's pretty cool<br>thank you ali how about you um i'm<br>probably<br>biased going from trek like clean<br>background so i'm very excited to watch<br>um yeah my teammates and even<br>everyone like that racing um in the<br>track cycling have been<br>um along the journey with<br>um a lot of like girls racing so yeah<br>it's quite<br>inspiring to see my teammates going off<br>and roasting the big games<br>um yeah makes it a little bit more<br>achievable<br>for me i think um yeah just this is<br>probably the first olympics where i<br>actually know<br>a lot of people at the game so yeah for<br>me seeing my friends and<br>fellow teammates at the games is really<br>exciting and<br>yeah pretty new concept for me yeah<br>excited to watch my teammates<br>to have that personal connection yeah<br>and ragland and one of our local<br>surfer labs is as billy steven was at<br>the games and it definitely<br>changed the whole family experience<br>watching when you have to<br>have a local or someone that you know<br>who you see in the street<br>or you your friends come down here yeah<br>what are you doing like belinda i think<br>i'm<br>excited about the smallest board of<br>sport that you get that<br>is made available um but<br>perhaps like rob i maybe wouldn't use<br>the word excitement but i'm interested<br>to see what happens because of all these<br>things that are happening in and around<br>the olympic movement and therefore the<br>games<br>as part of that but it's probably the<br>only time that i get excited<br>or interested in traditional sport<br>yeah i think that leads me really nicely<br>on to my second question around hosting<br>the olympics in the midst of a pandemic<br>which we all know has<br>been very very controversial and while<br>we might be doing relatively well here<br>in aotearoa<br>many other countries are still ravaged<br>by covet they're still<br>recording thousands of deaths per day<br>so why has the tokyo games gone ahead in<br>this context if we look at the history<br>of the olympics<br>the olympics have been cancelled in the<br>past with world war one and world war ii<br>um but the ioc was putting a lot of<br>pressure on<br>on the tokyo organizing committee to<br>host the games despite<br>uh surveys showing between 17 80 percent<br>of the japanese people not wanting the<br>olympics to go ahead<br>because of the risk and burden that it<br>would likely bring to them<br>and their country and we're not seeing<br>it necessarily for much of the media<br>but groups of the japanese public are<br>actively protesting during the games<br>and without the tourists and ticket<br>sales japan's actually going to be<br>losing<br>approximately 1.8 billion dollars from<br>hosting the games<br>one of our colleagues works in the u.s<br>professor jules boykov<br>as a leader in olympic critical olympic<br>studies and he<br>talks about the olympics and that the<br>public pays the private<br>profit and this seems more true in the<br>tokyo olympics than ever before<br>so hosting the games during a pandemic<br>is very risky business<br>with some benefiting more than others so<br>i would like to go back to the audience<br>to see your hands up<br>um how many of you think the tokyo<br>olympics<br>should be going ahead despite the fact<br>that we're still in the midst of a<br>pandemic<br>hands up you think we should be all<br>right interesting<br>thank you so back to our panel now<br>seeing that audience kind of response<br>might sway you a little bit but probably<br>not what are your thoughts on hosting<br>the olympics during a pandemic<br>what are the pros and cons the power and<br>politics involved in this decision<br>for the last 10 years you know it's a<br>big interest<br>and so i can only take the perspective<br>of a critical sociologist and that would<br>be to say that in every games there are<br>winners and losers<br>but behind that as you said with these<br>webs of power<br>and at the end of the day for the ioc<br>this is a way of making money um they<br>make<br>over 70 of their profit by broadcasting<br>rights<br>so from the irc's perspective it's vital<br>the games goes ahead and it doesn't<br>matter if there are no spectators<br>so they're the big winners here they<br>also don't have to<br>pay for any of the additional costs that<br>programs of course<br>all of that is is left to japan so that<br>seems to be a pretty unfair<br>um situation so the japanese people<br>to me are the losers um<br>every games for the last you know<br>right back through history um has<br>cost the host country huge amounts<br>um it hasn't made a profit<br>most of the legacy claims such as<br>it will increase sporting participation<br>in those countries<br>hasn't happened um the london games is a<br>great example of that that was their big<br>claim right<br>so the japanese people you know i really<br>feel for them<br>um they don't want these games they've<br>made it really clear the doctors are<br>saying<br>this is gonna this could be a spreader<br>event i don't know how the<br>athletes feel um i guess i'd say they're<br>broadly in the category of the winners<br>but they are a very small group of<br>people relative<br>to the number of people around the world<br>that have been impacted by kovec<br>so i'm definitely in a camp that i think<br>this is all about making money and i<br>don't think<br>it should have gone ahead anyone else<br>like to add to that extend upon that<br>challenge that i totally agree with<br>belinda um i think i read<br>somewhere um this week that the<br>in the running of the games while<br>there's the the host city has a contract<br>it's the ioc that ultimately has power<br>over whether whether or not that goes<br>ahead<br>and i understand that there's been<br>extreme pressure for that to go ahead um<br>i think<br>if we were to look inwardly at the<br>olympics in the paralympics i think<br>athlete welfare is a very real concern<br>yes they're a privileged view and yes<br>they have access to<br>healthcare and testing but i think we<br>need to ensure that those ethics are<br>protected<br>i think also there's concerns as well<br>about the integrity of the events<br>there's a very long list of athletes in<br>either the paralympics<br>or the olympics that are absent from<br>these games<br>so whether or not it is truly you know<br>the fastest the fastest the highest and<br>strongest<br>is up for debate and so yeah that's<br>that's kind of where i sit now<br>i might with uh just because i can<br>a slightly different perspective but<br>i don't think any games certainly in my<br>lifetime has not had<br>some sort of controversy associated with<br>it<br>and i can go back to lots of people<br>getting killed in mexico in 1968<br>and you can try it all the way through<br>zika virus and companies so<br>the context of the olympics has always<br>been a platform for discussion<br>as to what's going on in society and<br>then the sporting event in this case<br>it's the olympics every four years or<br>five years in this case<br>i think the conversation i've heard<br>today is a little bit<br>separate conversation one is whether we<br>should have olympic games that cost the<br>country<br>a lot of money and false economy since<br>the commercial reality of it<br>versus whether it should be run during a<br>pandemic i think they are<br>quite different conversations<br>i think the proof will be in the pudding<br>at the back end of it because i think<br>we're all playing a guessing game as to<br>what will be the consequence<br>of hosting in a high-risk environment<br>uh the pandemic the olympics<br>dr bruce hamilton's across the new<br>zealand team<br>pretty highly regarded doctor and he<br>said that without doubt<br>he feels very confident that our<br>athletes are safe<br>in that environment dave gerrard came<br>out for some of you will know dr david<br>from otago university came out this week<br>strongly in support of the interventions<br>that they have in place in terms of<br>protecting athlete well-being<br>all of that will play out in the future<br>because we don't really know what's in<br>front of us<br>so i think in the context of that we<br>should unpack the<br>debate into whether the olympics has had<br>to stay<br>versus whether in an event whether it's<br>world war whether it's pandemic whether<br>it's<br>potential viruses whether it's terrorism<br>as to whether an event<br>in this case the olympics should carry<br>on i'll be twixed<br>personally at a normal level i certainly<br>was<br>a month ago but the more i see<br>and the more i hear i think the world is<br>getting back into a new normal<br>and it's perhaps our yellow way of<br>looking at things which are<br>compromising our view of the pandemic<br>and the young books<br>thanks chief i think um<br>watching from the television screen and<br>knowing through bruce hamilton i'm sure<br>it looks like as many precautions<br>that could be taken are being taken uh<br>it does raise another kind of<br>interesting question though<br>as athletes around the world i think 15<br>of the athletes in tokyo are not<br>vaccinated<br>which tells us that 85<br>are vaccinated um and so<br>in many countries the athletes have been<br>prioritized to be vaccinated<br>so they can go and represent the country<br>which you know does raise some quite<br>interesting kind of questions around our<br>priorities and vaccination schemes<br>around the world<br>in terms of prioritizing healthy<br>athletes<br>to go travel um often over the<br>um more vulnerable groups in our<br>communities does anyone have any<br>thoughts on<br>i guess it brings this question of how<br>how important<br>is sport in our society how important is<br>it<br>is it in times of pandemic<br>is it more important i think so<br>yeah i think that um sport has the power<br>to unite<br>communities you know we've all suffered<br>this pandemic<br>and it's been horrific it's horrible uh<br>warranted that new zealand hasn't been<br>as affected as the rest of the world<br>which i think we should embrace but i<br>think that sport<br>brings people together and i think that<br>whilst this olympus is somewhat of an<br>opiate<br>um because of the pandemic that's<br>overlooming<br>but in saying that<br>people get excited and and i think that<br>i feel for the athletes<br>i know a bunch of the athletes that are<br>competing as well<br>and that worked damn hard to<br>to try and peak at the right time and<br>last year they were ready and now<br>they've had to repeat which is<br>as an athlete is so hard because you<br>invest so many hours<br>you know there's that side as well but i<br>do absolutely understand that hey<br>women are pandemic um but i believe this<br>this olympics<br>is about human spirit and i think that<br>this<br>brings the world together in some shape<br>um where we can for a moment<br>um focus on these amazing athletes and<br>support them and look at the wonderful<br>work that they've done to perform<br>out on the world stage so yeah and in<br>terms of the um<br>the vaccination choice thing was that<br>kind of<br>yeah yeah so um i mean i think as an<br>athlete you would do what you need to do<br>to be able to compete at your best when<br>you put<br>so much time and money into um into<br>competing<br>that raises quite an interesting paradox<br>when you consider the paralympics<br>where we know that covert has<br>exacerbated many many health inequities<br>among the disabled community yet for<br>those who are<br>intelligent id pathways talent<br>development pathways performance<br>pathways<br>they're now being fast-tracked and have<br>access to through vaccinations based on<br>the states until the athletes so<br>in many ways it can be quite empowering<br>in that sense so kind of a double-edged<br>sword really<br>and so we've got i think we have to be<br>uh certainly none of my athletes are in<br>the pathway of being<br>vaccinated so i'm lucky that i have 35<br>athletes<br>at the olympics who have been and all<br>have chosen to be<br>vaccinated um so i think we've got to<br>put in context about how many athletes<br>from new zealand are being vaccinated<br>relative to the population have been<br>vaccinated<br>and i think the public good this is part<br>of the conversation that you're raising<br>the public good<br>of them to be different views in the<br>audience based on the number of hands<br>that grew up before<br>the public good associated with<br>seeing our athletes the nationalism that<br>we might get from it or some of us get<br>from it<br>is weighed up against the fact that we<br>might have<br>500 roughly maybe 600 new zealanders<br>being vaccinated<br>in tokyo right now so the percentage of<br>our population potential<br>being vaccinated is a relatively small<br>amount as it is a sidebar issue<br>around when our athletes come back and<br>any iq<br>in a privileged position that they get<br>in iq places<br>they are occupying a very small<br>percentage of the government allocation<br>of miq spaces so again inflated<br>figures around how big a proportion of<br>the population are being impacted<br>either through miq and or injections are<br>i think they're overstating a little bit<br>okay this um it's kind of been mentioned<br>by your absolute blender oh because it's<br>okay<br>i was just gonna say that there was a<br>big<br>international survey the the results<br>came out last week and in fact i was<br>with the sport media class this week<br>looking at it so 22 countries<br>and although japan was the country that<br>at least wanted the games<br>surprisingly um majority at least 60<br>percent of the population<br>thought that the game shouldn't be going<br>ahead which i i was surprised<br>and it would be interesting to see um<br>after the games if it has made people<br>feel better and they do<br>um think it was it was the right thing<br>um and just<br>as i decided in my class so people that<br>are interested in sport<br>a third thought that it should have<br>their thought it shouldn't and a third<br>were pretty unsure<br>but for me i think that the issue about<br>the athletes having dedicated their<br>lives to this is really important but<br>the<br>counterpoint would be we have doctors<br>in tokyo pleading with the government<br>saying that we cannot manage the health<br>situation here and we<br>cannot have anything else to make this<br>get worse<br>and their voice is not getting the same<br>i don't think<br>um airing in the media as<br>it's easy to get behind athletes and get<br>excited and<br>feel their passion but you know<br>um doctors working in hospitals who have<br>been dealing with<br>this pandemic for a long time are so<br>worn down<br>and it's quite common to most olympics<br>leading up to it we hear all the<br>controversies and people are protesting<br>and there's often lots of debate and<br>discussion as soon as the<br>opening ceremonies and then the sporting<br>events begin all of that kind of gets<br>muted by a lot of the media and the<br>narrative kind of changes and we shift<br>our<br>attention so um i think i might<br>transition as to the next question which<br>picks up some of the things that mihei<br>and<br>jeff have just mentioned and hopefully<br>we can comment on this<br>but the the postponement of the games<br>and the impact that's had on those<br>athletes<br>as well as sort of logistics for sports<br>organizations like growing new zealand<br>and many others across<br>the country and around the world i'd be<br>really interested to hear some of your<br>comments on the<br>sort of the what have been the impacts<br>on athletes and so the psychology of the<br>carbon olympics i mean obviously<br>being there and that environment with<br>those spectators all those additional<br>stresses of masking and<br>social distancing while trying to be in<br>your peak performance and representing<br>your country<br>and then obviously the quarantine period<br>and often we talk about<br>um athletes having a post-olympic blues<br>will that be amplified when they're<br>quarantined<br>and having two weeks to not be<br>surrounded by family and just be able to<br>go over and over and over what happened<br>in their heads<br>um it's kind of keen to flesh out the<br>psychology for athletes and the<br>postponed games<br>um yeah i can touch on that i think yeah<br>i've had first<br>first hand experience on um<br>being heavily impacted by the<br>postponement of the games<br>i yeah like you said i'm a part of the<br>new zealand woman's endurance squad so<br>um trap cycling squad so got to see<br>firsthand hand how different people<br>dealt with it with the situation<br>it's obviously an unforeseen event that<br>it was postponed um it's not something<br>that an athlete<br>can mentally and physically prepare for<br>with the flip of a switch<br>365 days is a very long time to keep<br>training<br>um before an event that you're actually<br>uncertain will<br>actually happen um and i think<br>yeah you definitely saw um true<br>characters coming out during that time<br>that year was obviously<br>too long for a lot of people a lot of<br>people um use their lockdown as a<br>reflection time and<br>um retired early um<br>obviously you have to sacrifice a lot<br>for a whole year<br>and for the olympics and um yeah that<br>was<br>obviously a lot for a lot of people i<br>can probably talk on<br>development athletes and the impact<br>ahead on them<br>so with my story i um<br>like when the selection first came out<br>in 2020 i was happy with my position i<br>knew i didn't deserve<br>to be in that olympic team at that time<br>um when the quest went<br>came out as a development athlete i was<br>it was the best news ever because<br>for me that was another whole year that<br>i could train<br>um and prove to myself and decide new<br>zealand that i was good enough to be in<br>that team<br>in a year's time so that's exactly what<br>i did trying my for<br>months and months and months and then<br>the selection policy came out saying<br>that the<br>original team that would have been sent<br>to 2020 will be the team that's into the<br>21 games also which was<br>a pretty tough build as follow um<br>yeah i think and that's probably<br>happened for a lot of<br>development efforts as well um so yeah<br>that that was pretty hard um<br>but yeah i guess for the athletes as<br>well going to the games yeah it's just a<br>really long time<br>to have to train for especially um for<br>cyclists that train<br>usually chasing summers um another whole<br>winter in new zealand um<br>especially turns into groundhog day when<br>you're at the track and running out in<br>the road for three hours<br>every morning so yeah i think<br>definitely a double-edged sword that one<br>yeah things about perspective i think it<br>is really helpful to imagine<br>what it's been like for those athletes<br>trying to prepare for such<br>uncertainty i think there's a whole lot<br>of perspectives that<br>our balance sheet is a whole lot better<br>because we've<br>couldn't run european campaigns so you<br>can always look at it from a<br>banker's perspective but<br>i think the biggest impact on the<br>athletes are going to be the short<br>turnaround between<br>uh taylor and paris i think without<br>doubt there was a lot of learning there<br>was a lot of resilience<br>coaches and athletes i should we just<br>seem to focus on focus on<br>athletes i think the coaches found the<br>coded period really difficult in their<br>own sense because they had no<br>serious ways of establishing whether we<br>were trapping well<br>relative to the europeans which is what<br>we would normally get out of the<br>european summer and all those sort of<br>things so there's all those sort of<br>factors that came into it<br>but for me the learning upside would be<br>far greater than the loss in terms of<br>resilience and<br>adaptability and flexibility those sorts<br>of things so if i look at the positive<br>the real challenge for athletes will be<br>a very very short turnaround<br>between the washout of tokyo and<br>decision-making around retirement and<br>high performance for new zealand<br>government investing in high performance<br>we won't know that until<br>late december early january so we really<br>only have 18 months<br>to paris so you know longer term<br>the impact of the pandemic i think will<br>be more about paris than<br>than tokyo now i've got another question<br>that<br>has come from slido come from the<br>audience which i think kind of built on<br>this athlete experience and i saw<br>something<br>published i think it was today around um<br>we've all heard about the heat<br>right but i think um the impact the heat<br>in tokyo is having<br>on the athletes and i think the study<br>that i saw<br>or the article i saw was around tokyo<br>may have not been completely honest<br>around the potential heat and impacts on<br>athletes<br>so the question i have here is i would<br>like to know the panel's opinion on the<br>wisdom of the olympics taking place on<br>the height<br>of the japanese summer when it can be<br>dangerously hot<br>so i'll kick off really quickly because<br>my first stop here in<br>new zealand i was getting the health and<br>safety tour<br>you know my coaches dragged me into the<br>heat chamber<br>that was a pretty um rustic affair at<br>carapiro<br>and they were training at that stage and<br>and 91 humidity<br>and and roughly 33 degrees so that<br>monitored all the way through so i think<br>the athlete readiness<br>i think compensated because it's not<br>that hot really<br>if you cut to it around preparation and<br>some athletes are suffering in need it<br>was very interesting going back to an<br>earlier conversation<br>the commercial reality of the olympics<br>and the fact that we have two of our<br>swimmers<br>i won't go into the reasons why they<br>don't but they're swimming in the<br>morning<br>uh their finals so they can be broadcast<br>in the united states<br>and so we're compromising performance<br>against commercial reality<br>um because the tv audience in the us has<br>a dominant audience from the commercial<br>reality so<br>i think some of those things are<br>probably more detrimental to<br>athlete wellbeing mental well-being<br>because they're not able to compete at<br>their best<br>and that's not heat-related that's<br>scheduling and<br>commercial reality so there's all sorts<br>of things that go on but<br>our athletes aren't complaining about<br>they they quite enjoy it relative to<br>what they have here<br>rob do you have any comments on that<br>with the power impacts and the heat<br>issue<br>yeah i think it highlights um some of<br>the inequity or<br>the the lack of distribution of<br>resources across certain sports in<br>certain countries you know<br>all the well-funded borrowers or sports<br>will prepare well for me they'll go<br>through heat acclimation they'll have<br>access to heat chambers<br>um whereas for athletes with certain<br>impairments<br>he creates a different response a<br>detrimental response to performance so<br>for athletes who potentially don't have<br>access to those resources those<br>exercise physiology support heat<br>acclimation<br>then yeah they're going into a bit of a<br>sauna without very much practice<br>so yeah it's just not everyone has<br>access to<br>the preparation that would allow them to<br>perform their best um<br>so that's where i think that's what i<br>think it's a really interesting point<br>thank you<br>now i'm going to transition to the next<br>one because it does connect with one of<br>the<br>questions from slido so the tokyo<br>olympics have been quite controversial<br>around a range of new policies<br>including gender categories as we've<br>seen in the case of new zealand<br>weightlifter laura hubbard<br>and it's important to clarify beginning<br>this conversation that laurel has<br>legally qualified to compete in the<br>plus 87 kg olympic women's weightlifting<br>category<br>but her inclusion has triggered a lot of<br>debate across this country and around<br>the world<br>and i should note that we did invite our<br>amazing<br>research expert and transgender health<br>dr jamie beale to join us today<br>unfortunately<br>due prior commitments but i've had the<br>pleasure of working with jamie<br>quite a lot over recent weeks as we've<br>both responded to<br>an array of media queries about hover's<br>inclusion in the olympics<br>but i'm really interested in what the<br>panel thinks about the situation<br>which has obviously been very very<br>controversial over recent weeks and it's<br>i'll jump in here um so yeah when i<br>like i know laurel um and i knew<br>her before she transitioned because i've<br>been in<br>weightlifting for quite some time so i<br>was quite um<br>protective i suppose of her um when<br>people started attacking<br>her when she was given an opportunity to<br>compete<br>so personally i was torn because i knew<br>her and then in the same instance i<br>heard another story from tracy landrix<br>who i also know<br>and she told her personal experience<br>about<br>how she was affected um she's been<br>competing<br>and weightlifting tracy has been<br>competing in<br>weight lifting for over 10 years and she<br>was<br>the top of new zealand top of new<br>zealand fullest<br>for her weight in class category and she<br>got a phone call<br>and said okay all your records have been<br>broken<br>if you want to keep competing at this<br>weight class then you'll need to<br>drop weight and go into a different<br>class category because laura's just<br>broken all your records<br>so as an individual athlete and thinking<br>oh my gosh as a female<br>knowing that this has happened i i feel<br>a bit torn as well so it is<br>it is a bit of a a difficult thing to<br>discuss<br>um but in saying that laurel as a person<br>and transgender<br>are people they are humans and i believe<br>that they should be<br>respected and i don't think it's their<br>fault<br>at all i believe that it needs to be the<br>organizing<br>committee that should put things<br>in place where females such as myself<br>who may compete against someone who is<br>clearly<br>going to be way stronger than than i am<br>um<br>but i think that i for me i think that<br>this structure needs<br>to be put in place um to protect them<br>but also to protect the<br>um the female so i don't know i'm a bit<br>torn here<br>i really am torn i see both sides um but<br>i kind of<br>just sit in the middle and i think that<br>the olympic committee needs to make<br>the decision and have maybe a separate<br>category for transgender<br>women when they get awarded they still<br>compete with everyone but they get a<br>different award<br>um that's just that's i think my<br>perspective<br>yeah i think it's really interesting<br>that<br>that some of the social conversations<br>that we're having across the world<br>and trans and sexuality is not<br>a new conversation but i guess we go<br>back to carlos smith raising the first<br>400 meter running race and we start to<br>represent<br>really ethnic challenges in it we now<br>have the<br>i guess the transitioning athletes and<br>we know that there are two at the ipacs<br>very very silent in new zealand the fact<br>that there's a canadian footballer<br>he's transitioning uh he has<br>transitioned sorry so<br>you know i think the sport is dealing<br>with things which society is really<br>struggling with and we're not equipped<br>i'm not equipped to run new zealand you<br>know we actually have a<br>transition male to female<br>athlete because the person doesn't grow<br>particularly well with all due respect<br>to that person<br>that's not front page of the newspaper<br>so when it's not equipped i don't think<br>to deal with some of those social<br>challenges<br>at a personal level and this is very<br>ill-informed so i hope<br>not to offend anyone i still find it<br>very very interesting that the majority<br>of cases that we're hearing about in a<br>sporting environment<br>are male to female transitioning and i'm<br>concerned about equity for the people<br>who<br>are on the other side of the ledger so<br>you need to protect both sides of the of<br>the balance sheet along with<br>both sides of the equation to ensure<br>that everyone's<br>participating in a fairly safe and fair<br>environment so i just don't think sport<br>is ready for those conversations yet but<br>they're in front of us<br>yeah and it's definitely um going to<br>stay in front of us<br>i think there's one more our transfer<br>athletes the olympics which is<br>the substitute team so<br>i think you're right though what we're<br>seeing um<br>brought to the fore through sport our<br>biggest social issues around our<br>understandings of<br>gender and we've got to think about the<br>history of sport<br>which actually has this long long<br>history of being<br>based on a binary understanding of<br>gender<br>but many parts of society whether it's<br>in education and<br>schools in the workplace we're trying to<br>recognize that gender<br>isn't just a binary anymore so sport is<br>as work some parts of sport are working<br>to reflect that and<br>i can see it's very controversial and<br>difficult for a lot of people but it is<br>it's interesting to see sports<br>organizations trying to<br>to lead here and i think it's been<br>really important to see kerry<br>smith new zealand's olympic committee um<br>you know really being very clear this is<br>a culture of respect and diversity and<br>the team<br>should follow and respect that and i<br>think that's<br>showing some interesting signs of<br>leadership um<br>yeah i mean i agree with all the<br>comments i've made in the sense that<br>it's a really difficult issue and there<br>isn't a simple solution<br>and that is because sport is based on a<br>male<br>female binary and um transgender<br>you know challenges that and we also<br>know in sport<br>we've become increasingly aware of women<br>like caster semenya who<br>is different with a different situation<br>but equally she doesn't<br>neatly fit in terms of physiology she<br>has you know difference of<br>sexual development um and her<br>testosterone does not fit<br>what the international athletics<br>governing bodies<br>consider to be the right amount for<br>female<br>and so i think international sport is<br>going to have to actually get up to<br>speed more quickly<br>um the research is still limited<br>and still conflicts and we don't<br>it seems really know to what extent<br>naturally produce testosterone<br>in women who have differences of sexual<br>development to what extent that gives<br>some advantage there's conflicting<br>evidence<br>in the same way that we don't know for<br>transgender<br>um women the advantage<br>of height through puberty etc so we do<br>need research and that's really<br>important<br>it must be so hard for those individual<br>athletes and we know that some of them<br>are leaving sport because of it<br>um and i don't know if you're aware of<br>the<br>north american skateboarder um leo baker<br>who was selected for the us women's<br>skateboard team<br>and she was in the process of um<br>transitioning<br>to from to become leo and<br>decided that the rules of the drugs<br>and the limits that sport would put on<br>on him<br>was too much and he kind of dropped out<br>so you know that's quite a big deal i<br>think thinking about the welfare of<br>people and the ability to<br>identify themselves in a different way<br>that at the moment<br>the olympics is not able to do it's<br>really interesting how so much of a<br>conversation<br>focuses around testosterone and the<br>levels of testosterone<br>from birth and through the teenage years<br>but really performance<br>is so much more than how many nanomoles<br>of testosterone you've had<br>bodies come in all shapes and sizes um<br>different countries and how much they<br>can invest and their athletes and<br>opportunities the training facilities<br>that they can have i mean<br>sport is never a little playing field<br>so i think it's interesting that we<br>focus so much on testosterone<br>and we unpack that further as these kind<br>of<br>deeply ingrained assumptions around<br>sport<br>men being better at school and so<br>therefore men who transition to women<br>are therefore<br>cheating or trying to cheat the systems<br>there's so much we can unpack in this<br>and it really is a it's a moment that we<br>need to keep talking and<br>and learning because it's not a finished<br>conversation and obviously<br>we need to centralize the voices and<br>experiences of those from the<br>transgender community unfortunately many<br>have been silenced<br>in this conversation because of so much<br>online<br>abuse that they've been experiencing and<br>laurel has been subjected to so much of<br>that<br>so i think um as an athlete and a human<br>being we should be really proud of<br>not only being at the olympics but<br>having to overcome so much<br>difficulty in her life and and the<br>amount of abuse that's out there right<br>now is pretty um<br>disheartening to see that that's part of<br>our country really<br>um but beyond laurel we've seen a whole<br>lot of other<br>controversies around women and sport<br>around uniforms around drug testing<br>um with the us track athlete uh shakari<br>richardson<br>testing positive for marijuana we've<br>seen female athletes excluded for high<br>testosterone levels we've seen the<br>german<br>um gymnastics team wearing full<br>retards to as a way to protest the<br>sexualization of gymnasts bodies there's<br>a lot going on in this space does anyone<br>want to pick this up and<br>run with it exploit use the sporting<br>metaphors<br>how good that's happening that would be<br>my<br>perspective there was another issue not<br>longer a<br>beach volleyball tournament in the<br>norwegian girls refused to wear the<br>bikini set up that they were supposed to<br>wear and<br>decided with a comparable thing to the<br>some will say it's taken too long for<br>the athletes to express<br>their rights as humans to dress<br>appropriately or whatever<br>they're trying to do so again athletes<br>are taking the lead in their own<br>environment now and taking their own<br>accountabilities and perhaps giving the<br>bird<br>to officials who who still are in a very<br>traditional<br>and unfortunately male biased world so i<br>think it's<br>my previous group i had a good fortune<br>to lead with<br>and inclusion team at sport new zealand<br>so we start to talk about you know<br>the rights of the disabled people the<br>gender equity and those conversations i<br>just think it's<br>it's refreshing athletes are taking<br>ownership<br>and wish it would have happened sooner<br>well i guess<br>it identifies a whole system that is<br>built off athletic labor<br>where they don't get to make the call<br>yet who are we watching at the olympics<br>are we excited about<br>all of that that's built off them but<br>they don't get to make those choices<br>themselves<br>i mean i find the marijuana testing<br>absolutely fascinating you know there's<br>there's no<br>know is performance benefit to marijuana<br>other than potentially<br>the reduction of anxiety or performance<br>and i suspect that the outcry on the<br>back of<br>chittarou richardson is it will probably<br>be removed often competition<br>um wider list um just because of the<br>time and expense taken<br>to test for it and catch those<br>individuals who are doing it i would<br>suspect<br>in that individual case when she<br>mentioned that it was<br>to do with recent loss and dealing with<br>that the question would then be you know<br>what's the wrap around support for as an<br>athlete you know<br>you are an elite athlete with a peak of<br>performance you know that it's on the in<br>competition<br>list who is in her in her ear saying<br>now's not the time and so this for me<br>that begs wider questions but i suspect<br>the outcry from people believe that it's<br>removed yeah a lot of the um<br>the discussion the critical discussion<br>around this is the<br>the sort of the policing and regulating<br>of not only<br>women's bodies but brown and black<br>women's bodies who are often<br>those that um are the most<br>policed and regulated by sports<br>organizations<br>does anyone want to pick that up<br>yeah i mean i think that really goes<br>back to<br>the the previous sort of um<br>question or discussion around<br>women like castle sylvania i i read in<br>the newspaper this week that there were<br>two teenagers<br>from namibia who ended up not going to<br>the olympics<br>one was a 400 meter brother i'm not sure<br>about the other<br>um both of them and were<br>found that their testosterone levels are<br>too high to be considered a real<br>woman um both of them had no idea they<br>had high testosterone<br>or did their coaches order their<br>families they weren't coming from<br>wealthy countries where they were<br>had the benefit of um some of the<br>testing and so on that would happen in<br>other places so you know two young women<br>who<br>were up there with the potential to be<br>winning medals um<br>and these rules are not being applied in<br>ways that are<br>equal and fair there's been a lot of<br>debate about<br>how it is women particularly from africa<br>and india who've<br>been targeting through these these rules<br>you know and and it feeds into i think<br>these wider critiques of the olympic<br>movement have been going on for a very<br>long time<br>that it is still run by a bunch of old<br>white dudes basically<br>um you know they're incredibly<br>unaccountable<br>and it's only recently that they changed<br>the rules so that you had to retire<br>after the age of 80. you know it's come<br>down now to 17 or 60. but<br>you know the the ideas that are running<br>it and<br>most of these are it's braced in favor<br>how they get onto these committees i<br>mean<br>a lot of them are not there because<br>they've been talking sport or their top<br>coaches<br>it's actually still the minority that<br>come from the international federation<br>so it i think it's difficult to unpack<br>these questions without recognizing who<br>has the power<br>to set the agendas and<br>the women's volleyball example i mean i<br>agree with you it's great<br>that they're now getting visibility for<br>these concerns but i mean we've been<br>hearing about women's volleyball<br>hating their uniforms from day one you<br>know<br>and and the players say well why don't<br>we have to wear these<br>stupid up the bum kind of things that we<br>can't play in when the men get to wear<br>shorts like why<br>and this game is touted as the gender<br>parity games right<br>that is the overriding message from it<br>so essentially it's the platform for<br>those with female athletes who speak out<br>and that's great but for me it's too<br>little<br>too late and it shouldn't be those<br>athletes that have to change things it<br>shouldn't be these white dudes in power<br>yeah there's two sides not not to the<br>psychology degree by the way<br>about the old white parts anyway but um<br>we're around the show but<br>i guess again we're talking about change<br>and just as in our own workplace<br>if the person at the table is not doing<br>the job that you think<br>they should the workforce rebels<br>and the nurses go out on strike or<br>whatever happens to be<br>so the olympics any sport today that<br>sits on tv<br>is a commercial reality and the primary<br>owner of the property is the athletes<br>if the all blacks don't play the rugby<br>union goes broke<br>and so the power sits with the athletes<br>and the sooner the power is exercised<br>and they build the confidence to do that<br>and increasingly you're starting to see<br>that<br>across codes with player associations<br>and all sorts of things dynamics<br>happening<br>um ultimately the commercial power sits<br>with the athletes i think it comes back<br>a little bit to damien's point though<br>historically and they have not been<br>encouraged to speak up there's that<br>that athlete labor and basically shut up<br>and play you're not supposed to be<br>political and you're not supposed to<br>change the rules and regulations<br>but what we are seeing i think is an<br>interesting moment in time<br>and that social change perhaps has been<br>sped up in sports because athletes<br>are having a voice and technologies are<br>playing a really important part of that<br>in terms of social media<br>they're getting support from<br>international audiences and their fellow<br>athletes and so actually<br>sometimes they might have had a voice<br>and they've complained and often they<br>haven't been<br>heard or they've been slightly dropped<br>from the team in silence in lots of<br>different ways within the system<br>by using social media a lot of athletes<br>who had some of them have huge<br>multi-million followings and are they<br>working together<br>to try to to bring these issues to the<br>to the fore<br>um there's a long way to go though the<br>diocese of that right because they've<br>imposed rules um on the athletes about<br>what they can and can't protest about<br>all the athletes have to sign to say<br>that they<br>you know they wouldn't um use their<br>olympic platform for political purposes<br>you know political um and that could<br>that could<br>be a whole range of things yeah thank<br>you speak on that as well i have a<br>teammate<br>um kirsty james she put in a petition<br>because at the moment with track cycling<br>in a team pursuit you have<br>a team of five and in the actual race<br>itself you run<br>four people and there's um but you can<br>swap and then<br>that fifth rider so in a final there<br>will only be four people on the track<br>and in the middle presentation only four<br>people get medals<br>so if a person if that fifth writer<br>wrote the qualifying but didn't write<br>the final<br>they won't get a medal um so it's<br>not really that controversial um it's<br>not<br>like a huge topic like the transgender<br>or anything like that<br>but a petition was started for that<br>fifth person to get a medal<br>um and it was signed by thousands and<br>thousands of<br>cyclists all over the world and went all<br>the way up to the ioc<br>and for a topic that should not be that<br>hard to change<br>um the just slammed this up<br>um so i think there is power in athletes<br>to speak up<br>um but how far that message can get<br>should be questioned and very good yeah<br>absolutely<br>absolutely i think i might transition to<br>another question now<br>um we are seeing<br>uh we've heard already tonight some of<br>the things that some of our panelists<br>are most excited about<br>are some of these new sports these youth<br>focus sports like surfing and<br>skateboarding<br>and sport climbing and bmx freestyle at<br>the olympic games and i think the<br>surveillance finals are on right now<br>and in paris 2024 we're going to see<br>breakdancing or breaking<br>and we're going to see kite surfing and<br>belinda and i've obviously been<br>researching this for<br>a decade or so now and we know it's much<br>more than about bringing the youth<br>audiences in although that's a big part<br>of it it's also about<br>trying to respond to critiques of the<br>olympics as being elitist<br>they're trying to bring in sports that<br>are more participatory<br>trying to bring in more urban sports<br>we've seen basketball three on three<br>so we've seen a whole you know some<br>changes happening to the program<br>the ioc trying to be a bit more flexible<br>and responding to<br>changing ways that people are<br>participating in and consuming sport<br>be really interested to hear from the<br>panel in terms of what you think about<br>these new sports in the olympics and<br>and what it's sort of signposts in terms<br>of sports organizations like the ioc<br>trying to do things differently<br>or is it more of the same forced into<br>the same<br>package i think some people<br>will be coming to that question in the<br>audience or in general<br>around other sports even sports um<br>and i would be arguing against that type<br>of perspective<br>um but it's funny they're actually the<br>sports i'm the least interested in<br>at the olympics you know um i<br>um you know was taking a look at some<br>gymnastics<br>um believe it or not during work today<br>and you know i'm more interested in the<br>traditional sports and what's happening<br>within those spaces<br>i guess because i know the history of<br>how those sports have come to be<br>at the olympic games and some of those<br>sports<br>and not just the current ones that are<br>entering into tokyo<br>but all of the action sports that exist<br>within the olympic games summer and<br>winter games<br>except for climbing and surfing<br>none of them have entered off the back<br>of their own organization<br>they've been subsumed by a bigger<br>organization an existing one<br>that has already bodies with the ioc<br>someone wants to be in the games<br>they want that profile and what they<br>think might come from<br>being in that space but not all of them<br>do<br>you know the petitions that exist for<br>skateboarding not to be in the olympics<br>and again no<br>but no recognition of what that means<br>and someone else gets to make the<br>decision because ultimately it is about<br>participation in views and therefore<br>money<br>for the broadcasting um so i don't mind<br>that i haven't i've not been<br>contributing to the viewership of the<br>but yeah my i guess my personal<br>interaction to that space makes me<br>really upset with the fact that they<br>have that platform um not because i have<br>anything against me those activities<br>and i love them outside of the games<br>but uh with with the same sort of things<br>happening with parkour in the sense of<br>another bigger body which is the<br>international gymnastics federation<br>claiming parkour as their gymnastic<br>discipline despite our national<br>federations not having the<br>opportunity to have a voice in that in<br>that space<br>and just saying well we're going to do<br>it would you like to work with us and<br>make it happen because it'll be so<br>exciting you get to be at the olympics<br>and most people don't know about those<br>things behind the scenes they just get<br>to see it on tv and<br>decide whether they think they like it<br>or not you've had a pretty unique<br>perspective<br>with park or earth which you're now ceo<br>of and<br>the battle between park or earth and the<br>international park or community and<br>and folk in the whole kind of campaign<br>of we are not gymnastics and<br>that wrestle over power over who who<br>controls and defines<br>the future of this sport and i guess as<br>you were saying we've seen similarities<br>and<br>skateboarding in some of these other<br>oh my goodness um there's so much that<br>can be said i think<br>probably the most relevant thing<br>for me is having spent this past 10<br>years looking at the history of these<br>sports<br>being able to speak to athletes being<br>able to speak to the international<br>federations and also speaking to the ioc<br>as well and watching how things have<br>happened and changing over time<br>i'm more and more of a skeptic<br>and i think the ioc<br>has brought these sports in to try to<br>address<br>the aging um us audience in particular<br>which<br>for the last couple of games has been<br>around age 50<br>and they realize that their product is<br>just not as popular as it was and<br>they've got to do something about it to<br>change<br>um and they're also making a great deal<br>about<br>the gender equity and how they really<br>you know want to have<br>50 of the competitors being women and<br>we're very close to it in in<br>tokyo and these new sports have been<br>part of that but then we go<br>and look at what we've just been talking<br>about the the management of these<br>international federations<br>and the ic themselves you know in most<br>of them they don't<br>get nearly for the 20 well not most<br>that's not true but<br>in many that the ico recommending<br>20 of the boards should be women and<br>these these sports organizations are<br>some of the most male-dominated<br>organizations in the world um companies<br>tend to have much higher numbers of<br>women<br>on the board so if the ic was really<br>serious<br>i think they would be pushing a bit<br>harder in times for example in<br>coaching and leadership um<br>so i think it's a performance um and<br>this is i guess what we say in the book<br>is that<br>they they're using these new sports as a<br>way to try to demonstrate<br>that they are you know moving with the<br>times<br>uh and there's lots of complex<br>things that come from that and i think<br>there'll be some great winners<br>as i said i think women's skateboarding<br>is amazing and that i think<br>will be really beneficial for<br>skateboarding as a<br>culture because women have been really<br>really underrepresented<br>in professional skateboarding they have<br>no sponsorship very little prize money<br>very little opportunity and this is<br>really going to help women who are<br>skateboarders<br>but it's not going to happen everywhere<br>in new zealand<br>we do not have any athletes and that's<br>not because we<br>don't have good skateboarders the ones<br>that were good went off to australia<br>because it became<br>really clear really quickly that there<br>was not a penny of money that was going<br>to come to skateboarding<br>in new zealand in the first two years<br>and they've had a tiny amount of money<br>in the last<br>year and there's no commitment for<br>um the next games yet um and<br>surfing has had a bit of money but very<br>little so<br>there's lots of reasons for that and i'd<br>speak to that<br>the politics of this a lot better than i<br>can but budgets<br>you know they have to be determined over<br>time and<br>and there's lots of other sports out<br>there that are also<br>why not us you know squash has been<br>trying to get into the olympics for<br>a very long time very high participation<br>sport but it's not great tv<br>so it's just not going to get a place<br>that's the reality<br>builder's point about culture in terms<br>of skateboarding and<br>those beneficial beneficial<br>opportunities that come through<br>that visibility of the sport on the flip<br>side<br>the the thing that is attractive to<br>those<br>action sports and as a participant<br>around the culture what that<br>it feels like to be part of a<br>non-traditional<br>action sport alternative sport whatever<br>language you want to use<br>that as a draw card is one of the<br>reasons why the inputs<br>wants those sports to be in the games<br>but in order to make it<br>fit that mold you strip a lot of that<br>culture away<br>to make it fit that program you know um<br>i don't<br>know a great deal of diplomas personally<br>but the model within climbing<br>is something that never existed and you<br>know they brought all those things<br>together<br>um and you know i i<br>i guess i i take um<br>jeff's point about the athletes having<br>that same in terms of you don't show up<br>that doesn't exist<br>um but in our experience with parkour<br>and gymnastics<br>you know they um they just paid all the<br>athletes to come it wasn't even you know<br>their first things weren't real<br>competitions they were showcases<br>it's very hard to make an ethical stand<br>when you're getting free flights and<br>free food and<br>free hotel bookings and so all the<br>initial athletes once they discovered<br>what was happening with gymnastics<br>pulled out but then the second hero said<br>yes<br>and so and then by being able to<br>participate it slowly starts<br>chipping away at all the things that<br>yeah the kind of core community<br>holds deer and i think it is it's<br>in tokyo it's interesting too because<br>surfing skateboarding and sport climbing<br>and bmx freestyle<br>they were very much about this festival<br>environment that was the plan where<br>there was supposed to be elements of the<br>culture there there's just been music<br>there's supposed to be<br>you know the audience is supposed to be<br>able to have a go<br>there's lots of vibe about it there's<br>urban vibe and<br>the park area there but then without the<br>covered olympics without spectators like<br>so much of that wasn't bound to real up<br>being realised so we look at<br>skateboarding the olympics and many<br>might say<br>it stripped the culture of you know from<br>from the sport but actually partly that<br>was<br>that was part of the bigger plan but<br>hasn't been able to be seen there<br>um jeff i think one of the interesting<br>and if we tried to crystal ball going<br>forward<br>a number of the sports that are coming<br>into the olympic program uh<br>are what i would say are recreational<br>activities that are becoming sport<br>now rowing has always been a sport it's<br>not a recreational activity<br>you know what in their right mind would<br>grow up<br>so it's always been a sport so it's a<br>fairly simple one but surfing the<br>predominance surfing in new zealand if<br>we look at stats<br>people's if you ask surfers what sport<br>they play they say we don't<br>we don't play sport we serve we don't<br>play sport we skate<br>so the transitioning nature of a<br>recreational activity which kids have<br>done outside<br>in my world sorry young people since<br>they're kids our young people are done<br>outside the auspices of river and rules<br>and competition structures<br>and now become in sports it'll be really<br>interesting to see how they transition<br>and whether they uptake you know the<br>number of compared to the surface in new<br>zealand<br>you know you start to talk about<br>grommets and some of those things you<br>know you only have 30 or 40<br>servers at our nationals um so really<br>understanding<br>the challenge over time as to whether<br>they grow as sports or whether they<br>really are<br>almost anti-culture and they want to<br>stay in the recreational space<br>and i think it'll be a what we saw with<br>snowboarding for example<br>um very similar and introduced in 1998<br>very controversial and then we've got<br>those that take the olympic path the<br>sport<br>version of snowboarding but the majority<br>of participants it's very much<br>recreational and i'm sure they've seen<br>that same thing and surfing and<br>skateboarding and sport coming those<br>that choose the olympic pathway<br>but the majority that's just the tip of<br>the iceberg and the majority will be<br>recreational participants but you're<br>right that is<br>a big appeal for the ioc is actually<br>activities that people<br>actually do in their everyday lives<br>these what belinda's term<br>these lifestyle sports because their<br>actual participation<br>was quite high but we don't have to<br>actually measure those because they're<br>not going through our formal structures<br>and sport which we<br>which we measure they might measure it<br>by how many supports get solved<br>so it may be a commercial reality for<br>ric i mean<br>as others are the motivation may well be<br>in the untapped market around<br>billabong or whatever happens with the<br>manufacturer<br>in terms of skate cultures that sell<br>product<br>and that's why it's on tv because it'll<br>sell apart indeed so industry<br>the industry have been quite involved in<br>trying to get these thoughts out because<br>they know there's an economic boost for<br>them<br>i was just going to say it's funny<br>though it's almost like they've taken<br>this sport<br>and exactly what um david said you know<br>they've taken the culture out of it the<br>way that<br>i was watching the surfing and i was<br>like this isn't surfing<br>it's just that light culture you know<br>and<br>that felt like it was the sport was<br>colonized of course<br>you know in a way because it was<br>supposed to be a<br>free uh free thing that people go and<br>experience and<br>people watch and get stoked there's this<br>underground<br>um feeling that that was lacking and<br>then<br>and and i was thinking that they could<br>have changed the structure you know they<br>had 20<br>20 um of the top surfers in the world<br>and they could have<br>taken them out on a boat and taken them<br>out to some big surf to really showcase<br>the sport<br>but i think they took the culture out<br>and the same with skateboarding<br>it's like oh this kind of felt um<br>cultureless if i'm being honest so i<br>totally agree with you yeah<br>i really want to know what happens<br>you know the claims that exist are um<br>that have been challenged around the<br>impact of participation post olympics<br>and it's supposed to you know<br>um that was certainly big for london you<br>know the legacy<br>but these activities occur in locations<br>where<br>um whether there's necessity for<br>infrastructure or just the<br>existing environment and what is going<br>to happen to<br>increase the support of those spaces you<br>know with with parkour we're really<br>conscious that what happened with<br>skateboarding<br>was that councils went to build skate<br>parks<br>and then skaters who were trying to<br>skate in the city we're told well no<br>we've built your park<br>go there and escape there you know it's<br>also that in hamilton they've removed<br>the bylaw<br>for that stopped central city<br>skateboarding<br>which is great but you know if<br>if the olympic games is meant to have<br>this boom for cities that are hosting<br>these<br>the games what is the opportunity for<br>you know activity like skateboarding to<br>then have you know<br>um a city council um going oh this is<br>wonderful we're going to make it easier<br>for you to escape throughout the entire<br>city<br>or is it going to be focused on built<br>infrastructure that segregates and<br>isolates<br>people into the spaces and so with<br>parkour we want to<br>explore the world you know our<br>purpose-built spaces are nice to have<br>but that's not our goal but as soon as<br>you take it you put it into these<br>purpose-built<br>obstacles and spaces what's the fallout<br>that happens at the local level<br>and i'm not convinced that it would be<br>great<br>um i'm going to twist this a little bit<br>thank you<br>very important points there around<br>spaces and places<br>um we should know<br>that these new sports have not been<br>included in the paralympics and i've got<br>a question here if i'm going to<br>transition now into the slider questions<br>um should we forget about the<br>paralympics altogether and just continue<br>with this<br>perspective and dialogue<br>no thank you for that um<br>no that is indicative of an abel's<br>perspective the privileging of<br>able-bodied sports competitions mega<br>events over the paralympics and<br>in many respects we might be um at risk<br>of that hit because<br>the dialogue is very much on the<br>olympics with very little<br>um discussion of the paralympics now i<br>suspect that's always the case the<br>paralympics is always the younger<br>sibling if you like it's always a<br>disadvantaged cousin<br>and so but what's interesting is we like<br>to talk about<br>the paralympics in very superlative ways<br>so whilst<br>the paralympics is often left behind in<br>terms of viewing and staging and all<br>these things<br>we like to ramp up the discourse or the<br>systems of language that we use to talk<br>about disability and the paralympics in<br>how empowering and awesome<br>the paralympics is for disabled people<br>well there's not really that much<br>evidence for that<br>um and you know i think about i'm gonna<br>go off on one here sorry i don't know<br>how much time we've got<br>not much and we've got so many great<br>questions in here<br>question no we shouldn't forget about<br>paralympics uh that's the neighbor's<br>so much absolutely awesome questions<br>here thank you to our audience um<br>i am interested just to hold on to it<br>for a little bit the<br>conversation we've had about the<br>olympics relations with karen<br>on a really interesting dialogue that we<br>had a chat about earlier at the moment<br>around uh pararowing versus disabled<br>people growing<br>and they're quite different<br>conversations uh you know<br>20 new zealanders have a disability um<br>but 20 percent of new zealanders aren't<br>eligible to run paradigm<br>so if that makes sense the conversation<br>around inclusion<br>is quite an interesting thing whereas<br>the paralympics is actually quite<br>exclusive<br>from a disability perspective so how we<br>rationalize the debate<br>about inclusion and say directly or<br>whatever happens to be in the<br>olympics i'm really looking forward to<br>the social conversation around<br>this para header stay relative to<br>disability sport<br>and in a more inclusive approach to<br>disability which<br>transition could be sorry transitions<br>quite nicely maybe we can continue some<br>of this next question what are the<br>panel's views of athletes achieving<br>um no that's the wrong question this um<br>there is a continuing disconnect between<br>high performance and grassroots what can<br>high performance sport do<br>to raise the benefit of activity against<br>poor<br>health and vulnerability i think we're<br>kind of getting it that they're a little<br>bit in the disability<br>paralympic issue in terms of high<br>performance versus<br>everyday community physical activity<br>active recreation are we going like this<br>or what do you think i mean well in the<br>paralympics<br>yes so one of the things that<br>particularly international media<br>in the uk they really ramp up around the<br>superhumans<br>okay and these are the athletes that we<br>celebrate<br>they are and it's a derivative of<br>something called super native which<br>is<br>um these amazing athletes who overcome<br>their disability and achieve things that<br>normal people with disabilities couldn't<br>achieve and it's always<br>inspiring to an able-bodied audience<br>look at these amazing<br>disabled people who overcome their<br>disabilities what you tend to find is<br>the disabled community do not in any way<br>connect with that<br>because they do not face or have any of<br>the same privileges<br>that these athletes have and for them to<br>be active they face a multitude of<br>barriers<br>to um whether that be individual<br>attitudes i.e<br>i don't want to coach you social<br>barriers i.e stairs to a<br>stage um or cultural barriers<br>disabled people don't belong in school<br>and so<br>the ways in which we talk about high<br>performance disability sport is<br>necessarily exclusive privileges as<br>religious privileges um<br>there's able disabled and it excludes a<br>whole suede of people<br>we saw the paralympian becky myers last<br>week withdrawal from the paralympics<br>because<br>she was denied um a personal carer<br>she's a deaf-blind athlete what we would<br>conceptualize as highly impaired<br>but the paralympics privileges those who<br>are what what one of my phd students<br>would call the pretty grips the ones<br>that don't look different from you and i<br>um<br>and so yeah the ways in which we talk<br>about valorise high performance<br>disability sport<br>does not have the knock-on effect for<br>the community in the disabled community<br>and their access to sport<br>i argue that elite sport has nothing to<br>do with health<br>you know you want your athletes to be<br>healthy to perform<br>but in that space it's about you put<br>your body on the line often to achieve<br>the result that you want and so there is<br>quite a big<br>disconnect between that and that<br>grassroots experience you know<br>i never participated in any traditional<br>sport or anything at<br>all level but i you know i have broke<br>multiple bones and<br>concussions playing rugby but i've been<br>fitter and stronger than i've ever been<br>through parkour where i've just got to<br>make my own decisions and i haven't had<br>to compete against anyone else<br>so it's really hard to translate that<br>into participation into<br>grassroots consideration i spent<br>as i said stay away from the running<br>conversation because it is<br>primarily a performance orientated sport<br>but<br>the idea is i spend at sport new zealand<br>and a responsibility around growing<br>physical activity really for new<br>zealanders but through recreation and<br>sport<br>relative to the high performance<br>investment so there's always a<br>contestable conversation inside<br>government<br>as to how much and why we invest in high<br>performance versus investing and<br>basically physically 30. the outcomes<br>are completely different<br>and so if we try and draw parallels to<br>so really<br>we're dreaming i think we've gotten<br>enough global evidence now they're going<br>high-performance sport does not really<br>influence<br>physical activity any sustained sort of<br>way so therefore we have to measure<br>outcomes in a very very different way<br>and so not looking at the olympics to<br>expect to knock on effect into the<br>physical activity of new zealanders<br>because<br>the history tells us that won't happen<br>and so we start to look at<br>why do we invest in high performance it<br>might be about nationalism it might be<br>about aspiration<br>it may be it might be about social<br>connectivity go down to the pub and<br>watch the americas<br>maybe not the elephants but go down to<br>swimming or cycling<br>uh there's a motivation here for<br>government to invest in that whereas<br>over here there's a whole health and<br>well-being<br>outcomes that come from physical<br>activity so<br>they're not apples and apples so i think<br>we should treat them<br>in conversations quite separately thank<br>you got another great question here<br>the olympics is criticized for its cost<br>and environmental impact<br>what could or should change to address<br>this and if nothing changes<br>will the olympics die out i know berlin<br>that's a great question um part of a<br>performance of agenda 2020 this is the<br>you know olympics<br>trying to show that they're in the 21st<br>century is sustainability<br>and and this is just completely<br>corporate very much shame there's<br>so much um been written and shown<br>about all the terrible decisions are<br>being made but for me<br>the one that really strikes home is to<br>do with surfing<br>and um there was lots of debate in tokyo<br>whether a surface should be in a wave<br>pool<br>or in the ocean and one of the arguments<br>against the wave pool is the<br>environmental cost<br>and then once surfing was announced in<br>paris<br>there was lots of debate would it be a<br>wave pool would it be in<br>the southwest france beaches no<br>it's going to be in taihiti so the<br>international olympic committee are<br>going to fly or the the<br>national uh olympic flight all their<br>athletes to<br>tahiti to compete and they're going to<br>fly them all the way back to paris<br>for the opening and closing ceremonies<br>i'm sorry but that is not a decision<br>that um that an institution<br>vaguely worried about their carbon<br>footprint could make<br>um i think it's it's just hot air no and<br>i think<br>yes to to answer the question it is one<br>of the things that is going to show<br>even more the crisis that the ic faces<br>in its brand and how it's going to<br>manage it<br>all mega events really are problematic<br>when we think about the environmental<br>flying as<br>athletes and coaches and support teams<br>to parts of the world and flying them<br>all home again<br>the environmental impact of these events<br>as well as the<br>the tourism and the facility they could<br>go on<br>a huge be quite interesting in a few<br>years time the<br>track cycling event in brisbane<br>tucson in brisbane will actually be done<br>in the garage<br>by swift yeah that's right so you won't<br>you know i mean i guess that's where<br>it's interesting how this<br>will evolve the conversation into how we<br>actually play sport going forward<br>now it may not be in the immediate<br>future<br>again the adaptations that will need to<br>be made that will take it to the extreme<br>people won't need to get together to<br>participate they'll be on an air growing<br>there's definitely a whole movement<br>around the future<br>being virtual games that's right esports<br>in these fortunately<br>so i want to thank the audience for<br>those very engaging uh<br>questions there are a lot more i<br>couldn't get through them all but thank<br>you thank you for our parents for<br>responding to those uh<br>excellent questions uh<br>i do want to um before we say our<br>farewells acknowledge<br>the university uh contributions to the<br>games<br>i'm not sure if you know this but we<br>have um<br>an incredible group of our current and<br>recent sir edmund hillary scholars<br>competing at the games<br>and they as certain hillary scholars<br>here<br>they are they're athletic and their<br>academic pursuits<br>are supported when they study with us<br>and i think we've got greg<br>o'carroll an audience who is our high<br>performance student scholarship manager<br>who plays a really key role in<br>in supporting these athletes and<br>pursuing and achieving their<br>all their types and dreams also we have<br>a number of our postgraduate students<br>and our staff<br>who played key roles in doing research<br>to support the health and well-being and<br>performances of athletes and teams<br>attending the games<br>so i just like maybe put our hands<br>together for our<br>so just in closing i want to thank our<br>amazing panelists for sharing their<br>insights and wisdom with us tonight<br>it's been a real treat i've really<br>enjoyed it i've heard many different<br>perspectives from athlete perspectives<br>uh sports administrators sports leaders<br>and obviously<br>um critical academics and i hope<br>the conversation tonight gives you all<br>something to think about<br>as you go out into evening and you<br>either watch the games or you choose not<br>to<br>over the following weeks so on that note<br>however</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
