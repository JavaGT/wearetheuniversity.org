Janice’s career-wide research interest has focused on human perception, from early questions regarding newborn babies’ understanding of speech sounds through to object and face perception. Most recently her work has focussed on the changes in our ability to recognise facial emotions that accompany normal adult ageing, and the implications of those changes for social and cognitive function. Janice joined the Department of Psychology in 1991 and has supervised 40 postgraduate students to completion.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be

and i'm the<br>acting vice chancellor at the university<br>of otago<br>and it's my great pleasure to welcome<br>you all to this special occasion<br>to celebrate janice's promotion to<br>professor<br>it's good to see many of janice's<br>colleagues students<br>and the chancellor but i'd like to give<br>a special welcome<br>to janice's partner sally<br>and her son daniel and his partner<br>becker in melbourne and her family and<br>friends who are<br>joining us from overseas via the virtual<br>live screen live stream so it's lovely<br>that you can all join us<br>inaugural professorial lectures are<br>special occasions where we have<br>the privilege of taking time out of our<br>lives to learn about the many facets<br>of the work of our outstanding<br>colleagues and as some of you have heard<br>me say before<br>promotion to professor at the university<br>is not easily achieved<br>and janice has gone through a rigorous<br>progre process<br>to demonstrate that she is worthy of<br>this promotion<br>a process that involves seeking feedback<br>from external referees across the world<br>and in a moment professor barker's going<br>to<br>provide a formal introduction and<br>explain how professor murray<br>as a psychologist is an international<br>expert in the field of face perception<br>and the effects of aging on social<br>competence<br>but i'd like to add a few personal<br>comments about janice first<br>and particularly her contribution to the<br>janice has developed a vast wealth of no<br>knowledge in her role as associate dean<br>academic for sciences and janus your<br>expertise is recognized not only by<br>colleagues in the division<br>of sciences but also across the wider<br>university<br>and particularly at the boards of<br>undergraduate and graduate studies<br>perhaps more importantly you've<br>graciously shared your knowledge with us<br>and your leadership has been key as the<br>university grappled<br>with maintaining quality teaching and<br>learning for our students since the<br>appearance of covid in new zealand<br>so janice it's been a pleasure working<br>with you congratulations on your<br>promotion<br>and i'd like to invite professor murray<br>uh presa barker<br>curator<br>it is my pleasure to introduce our<br>speaker tonight professor janice murray<br>to give her inaugural professorial<br>lecture here at the university of otago<br>as indicated by professor nicholson<br>janice is one of our newer professors<br>at the university of otago having<br>received a well-deserved promotion<br>and to the position of professor in<br>february of this year<br>janice as you know grew up in canada<br>i'll let her tell her own story<br>but i do have permission to share the<br>fact that in high school she was on<br>the basketball team that won the<br>regional champs<br>quite why she never pursued a career in<br>professional basketball<br>janice's undergraduate degree was from<br>dalhousie in<br>nova scotia which she followed with a<br>master's degree from waterloo the<br>university<br>in ontario followed by a phd at the same<br>institute which she completed in 1986.<br>she came to new zealand for a<br>post-doctoral fellowship at the<br>university of auckland which she<br>followed with a one-year lectureship<br>at auckland before returning to canada<br>to take up<br>an assistant professorship at carleton<br>janice held her position at carlton for<br>three years before finding her true home<br>both academically<br>and literally in dunedin when she joined<br>the department of psychology in 1991 as<br>a lecturer<br>the job offer as she tells it came to<br>her while she was on holiday<br>in the murray family cottage in nova<br>scotia and a message<br>came down from the farmhouse saying that<br>she should call jeff white<br>in dunedin new zealand so she did so<br>from a call box<br>perched on the edge of the atlantic<br>ocean<br>since her appointment in 1991 janice has<br>progressed through academic ranks and<br>reached the present position which we<br>celebrate tonight her research has been<br>focused on human perception<br>and from this she has published 36<br>journal articles<br>her referees for the promotion process<br>all commented on the fact that her<br>research is highly regarded<br>and significant in what's referred to as<br>a crowded field<br>one referee in particular noted her<br>reputation as a sharp thinker<br>as many of us can attest also a<br>knowledgeable expert<br>and a solid experimentalist<br>promotion at otago is never just for the<br>excellence of your research<br>our professors have to demonstrate all<br>around excellence and janice has proven<br>to be<br>a truly excellent teacher in addition to<br>her undergraduate teaching<br>she has supervised seven phd students<br>and seven masters students to completion<br>as well as supervising another 25<br>but of the three areas of academic<br>responsibility it is service<br>where janice has excelled this has not<br>just been university service but outside<br>as well she has served four terms on the<br>editorial board<br>of the psychonomics bulletin<br>from 1998 to 2010 and frontiers in<br>psychology for six years finishing this<br>position last year<br>her service to the university however<br>has been exemplary<br>and in this she has set a very high bar<br>for those who wish to follow<br>starting within her department janice<br>was the honours degree coordinator the<br>double degree<br>advisor undergraduate studies chief<br>advisor position she held for 12 years<br>and her work in providing advice to<br>students gave her an excellent<br>understanding<br>of the intricacies of the degree<br>requirements and so it was fitting<br>that she took on the role of associate<br>dean academic in the division of<br>sciences<br>commencing in 2013.<br>as associate dean academic as brendan<br>here<br>you just want to listen to this janice<br>has been chair<br>or deputy chair and even occasionally a<br>member of more than 20 academic<br>committees<br>work and working parties at the<br>divisional level and another<br>30 at the university level these include<br>her membership of bugs and boggs<br>the health sciences first year board<br>course advising working party and then<br>implementation group<br>chair and deputy chair of the sciences<br>standing committee<br>investigator of academic misconduct<br>cases and academic grievances<br>a position she's held since 2014 and<br>most recently<br>a member of the covert 19 academic<br>impact group and covert 19<br>examination operations group<br>for me personally janice's most<br>significant role<br>has been as deputy pro vice chancellor<br>the workload when i came into this role<br>was high and complex as we were in the<br>middle of a significant amount of<br>organizational<br>change at the university and janice's<br>support through this<br>has been absolutely fantastic and<br>something for which<br>i will be forever grateful we will miss<br>you janice in your retirement but wish<br>you well<br>now it is time to hear about janice's<br>journey in her own words so please join<br>me<br>thank you all very much for coming this<br>evening and it's<br>appreciate the time that you've taken to<br>as richard said i grew up in canada<br>and in a place called anakinish that's<br>where i was born<br>you see there my mother and my father<br>i'm the one on the left<br>in the arms the others is the dog topsy<br>who preceded me<br>not quite sure if i appreciate the look<br>that the dog is giving the new<br>interloper<br>it seems that early efforts to hide my<br>devil character with a under a hat<br>were were largely unsuccessful<br>um so ana ganesh what is that's an odd<br>word anakinish is mikma<br>first nation people name for our town<br>and we don't know because the language<br>the first nation language has evolved<br>whether that means<br>where the bear scratched the branches<br>off the trees or where the<br>five rivers meet we accept both of those<br>anakinish is a largely a town that<br>services a farming community and a<br>fishing community<br>as many places in nova scotia it's very<br>small 5000 people<br>but it had one major plus in addition to<br>the lovely people that lived there and<br>that was the presence of saint francis<br>xavier university<br>so saint of x is a liberal arts college<br>it has produced at least one prime<br>minister and many other interesting<br>people<br>so that meant in growing up uh i got to<br>know a lot<br>of people that were doing very<br>fascinating creative interesting things<br>so our life was full of music and<br>theater and science<br>because of the connections we had<br>through the university<br>um i wasn't the only one in the family<br>and shortly<br>over time i was provided with<br>three brothers and so here we are in the<br>traditional christmas eve<br>shot so many years ago<br>this was a cartoon my mother shared with<br>me a long time ago<br>she felt very disappointed i think that<br>she had not been able to<br>give forth a sister for me and i i'll<br>read it says i hope we don't get any<br>more boys<br>my hands are full with three brothers<br>but they weren't too bad to be a big<br>sister too and as it turns out they all<br>turned out to be quite wonderful<br>individuals and i think<br>we can thank our parents for that and so<br>there<br>is the last time i was with my mother<br>and father<br>in 2019 pre-covet times<br>and our parents were very much of the<br>view that we should do what we want to<br>do<br>and excel in whatever areas we want to<br>excel so we were fully supported<br>in everything that we did we were<br>celebrated when we had successes<br>and we were instilled with the basic<br>values of fairness and generosity<br>so we can all thank my brothers and i<br>can thank<br>our parents for for all that they have<br>what i want to start with tonight in<br>talking about research is infant speech<br>perception<br>and you know why this is important to me<br>will become<br>obvious a little farther down the track<br>why why there so this is the first area<br>of<br>real research interest that i had and<br>speech perception is very important<br>fundamental aspect of us<br>acquiring language and being able to<br>communicate and of course as you can<br>imagine<br>speech perception is fairly complex so<br>for adults<br>if we break take and as an example two<br>consonants<br>ba a b in a p sound and call them ba<br>and pa we can look to see what are the<br>acoustic<br>elements that allow us to make the<br>distinction between those two sounds<br>a boss sound is referred to as a<br>voiced uh sorry from a voiceless sound<br>and a paw is voiced and that has to do<br>with<br>the expression of the consonant coming<br>through the mouth and the vibration of<br>the vocal cords<br>there is a delay in the uh in the<br>timeline of those two elements of those<br>sounds for<br>the uh sound but not the boss m<br>and you can create a nice continuum of<br>acoustic change which is equal equal<br>in magnitude along the very steps of the<br>continuum from a bar to a possum<br>and if you ask people to be able to<br>identify those<br>changes or discriminate the changes<br>along that continuum of acoustic change<br>what you find is that people are only<br>able to discriminate<br>change along that continuum for<br>sounds that they can that are different<br>in their label<br>so for example if it sounds like a ba<br>versus a pa<br>then you can discriminate the acoustic<br>change<br>if you they are different uh sorry<br>the same labels that are used to<br>describe those acoustic changes<br>perceptually you cannot adjudicate those<br>differences<br>so between category you can discriminate<br>and within category<br>you can't so that's the adult<br>categorical perception model<br>which covers a large quantity of our<br>space<br>speech perception ability so the<br>interesting question is<br>when we're born how are we geared up<br>okay can we perceive these important<br>distinctions<br>do we perceive information categorically<br>now this points to one of the tricky<br>bits of being a psycholo<br>psychological scientist you can't just<br>some stare down the barrel of a<br>microscope and you sometimes have to<br>think quite creatively<br>and how you're going to measure what the<br>behavior<br>that you wish to measure in this<br>instance how we're going to find out<br>whether or not<br>babies can perceive<br>speech sounds categorically and this was<br>the invention of the high amplitude<br>sucking procedure and basically<br>there's a pressure transducer and<br>connect it to a<br>pacifier or a dummy and that's placed in<br>the mouth of the infant<br>they suck on the pacifier<br>and they when they do that to a certain<br>level<br>they will receive a sound babies quickly<br>learn<br>that their sucking responses actually<br>control<br>the sounds coming and it's quite<br>marvelous to watch them you can almost<br>see<br>and i'm talking six to eight week old<br>babies you can see the light bulb come<br>on when they go<br>oh yeah and they they look like lis uh<br>lisa's little sister on the simpsons<br>so they will suck furiously until they<br>like everybody else gets bored<br>you know so they will reduce their<br>sucking behavior when they tire of it<br>and when that habituation<br>occurs what takes place is a change to a<br>a sound the sound might be<br>within category sound that adults do not<br>discriminate well<br>or it might be a between category sound<br>which means<br>uh it's a sound with a different label<br>or there might not be any change at all<br>in other words you continue with the<br>same sounds and these are the findings<br>of uh that study that was carried out<br>first by imus sicklin<br>jusic and vigorito rigorito in 1971.<br>and what you can see on that graph and<br>this is an example from our<br>four-month-old infants<br>that infants<br>suck furiously they tire<br>and then when they are introduced to a<br>new sound what<br>does their behavior look like so in the<br>control condition<br>they continue to reduce their sucking<br>behavior there's no change in the sound<br>for the within category so an acoustic<br>difference between the new sound and the<br>old sound<br>but one that in the adult perception<br>would require the same label<br>you find that there is very little um<br>change<br>in the occurrence of the furious furious<br>sucking behavior<br>and contrast that with the between<br>category now the new sound is presented<br>it is a sound from a different<br>perceptual category<br>and lo and behold this the infants are<br>interested again<br>and madly sucking on the dummy<br>so that's the basic finding and<br>that paper was the sentinel paper for<br>studies of infant speech perception it<br>has today<br>over 3 000 citations associated with it<br>and what i want to draw your attention<br>to is the third author of that paper and<br>that is a man by the name of peter<br>jusick<br>and peter uh was a fourth year honor<br>student<br>when he uh participated in in that<br>research<br>so a fourth year honor student had a<br>tremendous experience<br>introducing him to research and he went<br>on to become one of the leading<br>researchers in the area of infant speech<br>perception<br>lucky for me when he finished his phd he<br>took a position at dalhousie university<br>and i arrived there and not very long<br>after he had<br>and like many a student going thinking<br>to university thinking<br>kind of interested in that psychology<br>stuff and you know i think i'll be a<br>clinical psychologist<br>that's not something we've ever heard<br>before is it<br>and and and over time if after a year or<br>so i thought well<br>i'm not sure if that's really my thing<br>and<br>i also went off with around that time<br>to a compulsory course advising session<br>where i met with an academic advisor<br>and i explained you know what my<br>interests were and so forth he said i<br>think you should take this paper<br>uh psychology of language which i did<br>and uh taught by peter jusick<br>and it was the first time i'd ever been<br>challenged and<br>required to actually think he brought me<br>into his lab<br>and as a third year student i became<br>involved in the infant speech perception<br>research<br>and i did my honors dissertation with<br>peter in the infant speech perception<br>lab<br>and that was it i was hooked this is<br>what i wanted to do<br>this is the great interest that i have<br>you know in studying perception how is<br>it that we<br>take that information that we are<br>bombarded with how do we<br>configure it so that we can make sense<br>of it and perceive<br>sounds perceive images and so forth<br>so i ended up as a third and fourth year<br>student with two publications and we<br>looked at things like<br>the measurement of time temporal<br>parameters around non-speech tones how<br>do they<br>how are they perceived by young infants<br>as it turns out<br>perceptually in terms of categories as<br>is was the case with speech sounds<br>so there were clear perceptual<br>categories around<br>the leading lagging simultaneous<br>presentation of tones<br>and we looked at other speech sounds and<br>and<br>um explored the effects of context on<br>uh discrimination of speech sounds so<br>infants are very clever<br>they come into the world capable of<br>perceiving speech sounds<br>they have innate perceptual ability to<br>do so<br>and it's quite striking striking in that<br>the research that was carried out around<br>that time and subsequently<br>showed that regardless of the language<br>environment into which an infant is born<br>they are able to perceive a wide range<br>of sounds that<br>will not occur ultimately in their<br>native language<br>so for example the sounds ra and la<br>which we as english native speakers can<br>discriminate<br>are not perceptible to japanese adults<br>japanese infants can make that<br>discrimination<br>so that capability is present at birth<br>it disappears within the first year<br>usually around eight to ten months<br>and of course reflects perceptual<br>learning<br>so that was my beginning i then as<br>richard said went on to<br>study at to do my phd at the university<br>of waterloo with phil brydon and<br>i began continued my interest in speech<br>processing but mapped it on to<br>laterality how is it that we process<br>information in the two halves of the<br>brain<br>i started developing an interest in<br>object perception while i was there<br>and when i finished my phd i was<br>extremely fortunate<br>to have a postdoc opportunity<br>with mike corbless at the university of<br>auckland<br>i continued to develop my object<br>perception went back to canada for a<br>while<br>and as richard indicated was extremely<br>lucky<br>and blessed to get a job offer<br>here at the university of otago where<br>when i arrived i continued with object<br>perception but then became really<br>interested in what i think is the most<br>fascinating object<br>and that is the human face the face is<br>really an object<br>like many other of the any objects that<br>we have that we can pick up and look at<br>but it has some particularly special<br>characteristics that differentiate it<br>and make it special<br>relative to the other objects non-facial<br>objects<br>and i think humpty dumpty characterizes<br>that<br>well here the the trick problem<br>and this is a his response to meeting<br>allison he's saying i just don't really<br>know if i'm going to<br>know you if i meet you again and she<br>said well generally we use the face<br>and his response is well that would be<br>great if you<br>if you could take a couple of eyes and<br>stick them along the side of your nose<br>that might help me remember who you are<br>because it will differentiate you so<br>that's the problem<br>of face perception we all have on a good<br>day two eyes a nose and a mouth in that<br>particular order<br>so how is it that i'm able to recognize<br>my friend<br>from someone i've never seen before<br>captured well by the face inversion<br>effect is<br>that's an upside down face and<br>many of you will probably recognize that<br>individual<br>but it may have taken a couple of<br>seconds and perhaps some of you aren't<br>even sure<br>uh if i present you with the in the<br>upright face then<br>bam you know that is the prime minister<br>of new zealand<br>this is the face of inversion effect and<br>this this is an effect that is<br>particularly strong<br>in faces if i showed you a car that was<br>upside down<br>you'd be able to recognize it very<br>quickly<br>what the face perception face inversion<br>effect has suggested<br>uh is that what's critical in allowing<br>us to recognize faces<br>is not the individual components or<br>features of the face<br>but rather the spatial relational<br>information<br>about those face components and that's<br>what's encoded in the upright face<br>when we turn a face upside down<br>what results is a difficulty in encoding<br>that spatial relational information<br>and i want to add that that spatial<br>relation relational information is not<br>just simple metrics about distances of<br>eyes to nose and nose to mouth and so<br>forth<br>but that information that's integrated<br>in a more holistic fashion<br>across the face and so when inversion<br>takes place<br>predominantly component information is<br>what we're left with<br>uh in terms of our processing to allow<br>us to recognize<br>faces that's called the dual mode<br>hypothesis first<br>put forth by carrying diamond way back<br>in 1977 but that's a fundamental<br>principle of face processing which<br>hasn't changed too dramatically over<br>time<br>i want to convince you a little bit more<br>of the importance of spatial relational<br>information and<br>here's a shot of me you know just not<br>yesterday but a little while ago<br>and i want to show you what would happen<br>if i<br>white at some of my eyes and blackened<br>some of my teeth you know might have<br>been<br>you know getting up the bottom of a<br>really nasty wreck<br>uh if i invert that view of myself you<br>can still<br>see that grotesqueness or that<br>bizarreness<br>in my face so i haven't changed any of<br>the spatial relational information<br>everything as it should be i've just<br>distorted the individual components<br>contrast that now to another<br>manipulation in which what<br>what's taken place in the image you're<br>about to see is the eyes have<br>been inverted and the mouth has been<br>inverted in an<br>otherwise normal face i'm sure my sons<br>sometimes think that's me on a good day<br>when they're<br>when they were growing up what i want to<br>show you now<br>is what happens if i take that image<br>which looks pretty bizarre<br>so you can see instantly the difficulty<br>there is in perceiving<br>those spatial relations in a holistic<br>fashion<br>across the face and even knowing<br>as you do that the mouth and the eyes<br>are inverted in the otherwise normal<br>face<br>and you can get a sense of something odd<br>it really doesn't look that bad and i'll<br>take that look any day<br>so that's known as the thatcher illusion<br>and that was um<br>documented by thompson way back in 1980<br>called the thatcher illusion because it<br>was<br>depicted in the journal article using a<br>face of margaret thatcher<br>i think most people at that time really<br>liked the concept of a distorted<br>margaret thatcher<br>and what was interesting in that at that<br>time in 1980 of course we didn't have<br>photoshop<br>and the way in which you<br>illustrated that distortion was simply<br>cutting out and flipping out on a<br>photograph the eyes and the nose so you<br>could blatantly see<br>that there was a something that happened<br>to the face but even then when the face<br>is<br>turned upside down uh it is that<br>perception is lost<br>so this is consistent with this idea<br>that we have two types of<br>phase processing one for upright faces<br>where we encode spatial relations<br>holistically<br>and that there is a second type<br>predominantly component when the face is<br>inverted<br>but you could account for that inversion<br>effect by simply saying well<br>maybe it's not a different type of<br>processing maybe it's just that when the<br>face is rotated upside down it becomes a<br>little bit<br>harder to extract the information and so<br>how can we test this idea of there's a<br>difference in type of processing<br>for upright and inverted faces<br>i'm going to show you a little<br>illustration so you can experience the<br>phenomenon<br>of that leads to the another experiment<br>that i'm about to<br>tell you about that will hopefully<br>answer that question so this is just an<br>illustration of<br>a what we'll call our thatcherize face<br>and it's going to be rotated in 15<br>degree<br>steps if one cross that rotation from<br>zero to<br>to 180 degrees it just gets<br>harder to perceive the spatial relations<br>in the face<br>we might expect that it gradually starts<br>looking a little less bizarre<br>if there is actually a shift in our<br>processing<br>we might expect that comes a point where<br>we no longer see<br>the spatial relations within that face<br>holistically<br>and we are left with um the<br>predominantly components<br>in other words there will be a shift in<br>our perception<br>rather than a gradual quantitative<br>change<br>and i think probably most of you will<br>have experienced somewhere between 90<br>and 120 degrees<br>the face all of a sudden started to look<br>okay again<br>it wasn't as bizarre and this is the<br>kind the task that we presented to our<br>participants<br>they were presented with individual<br>faces not neatly in a nice<br>linear rotation as i've just shown you<br>but faces uh thatcherized unaltered<br>faces<br>and component distortion where the eyes<br>have been white and the teeth have been<br>blackened<br>and what you can see there is what i<br>want to draw your attention to mostly<br>is the thatcherized effect<br>so that's the mean bizarreness ratings<br>which we asked our participants to<br>give how bizarre do you think that face<br>looks and you can see at the outset<br>both the component distortion and patch<br>rise faces look<br>pretty weird component distortion<br>get a slightly more bizarre as the face<br>is increasingly brought to 180 degrees<br>but there's a nice linear effect there<br>in the thatcherize phases<br>there is a discontinuity in the function<br>so<br>hopefully reflecting that experience<br>the change occurred so that if you were<br>just plotting a linear function there's<br>a disruption to that linear def<br>function somewhere around 90 to 120<br>degrees<br>so this was a study carried out with<br>emeritus professor now jill rhodes<br>and esther young and esther young this<br>so i want to bring us to the<br>next part of our our talk and my talk<br>and that is does that change with aids<br>does face processing<br>change with age and<br>this is where i bring in the importance<br>of good collaborators<br>so in our department we have people<br>doing a whole bunch of different things<br>in psychology<br>and two individuals professor ted<br>ruffman and professor jamin halberstadt<br>uh uh work in areas that are different<br>from mine and professor ruffman who was<br>interested<br>in development and theory of mind<br>starting to get an interest in emotion<br>recognition<br>and professor halberstadt was interested<br>in social cognition and some elements of<br>face processing<br>so the three of us got together and<br>thought let's play in the sandbox<br>together<br>and from that we produced a very<br>productive<br>good decade of research together and i'm<br>very grateful<br>to them for that opportunity and so what<br>we did first was to take that very task<br>i've just<br>described to you and presented not only<br>to young adults but<br>also to older adults and what's notable<br>here<br>there are a few things but what is<br>mainly notable is first that the older<br>adults<br>show that same discontinuity<br>discontinuity effect<br>so they too seem to lose a perception<br>of the bizarreness of the face around<br>90 to 120 degrees of rotation<br>what's also noticeable is that older<br>adults<br>show lower ratings of bizarreness right<br>across the board and indeed<br>show a greater inversion effect and this<br>suggests<br>that older adults are with age<br>we lose that sensitivity to the holistic<br>configuration of the face<br>that our ability to engage with those<br>spatial relations<br>uh diminishes as we get older<br>you can see that for the older adults by<br>the time the face was rotated 180<br>degrees<br>it was almost looking normal to the<br>older adult participants<br>unlike the case with young adults and<br>that suggests<br>that they are quite compromised that<br>they are<br>fundamentally operating on space not<br>spatial properties but the single<br>faces not only provide us information<br>about identity but they provide us<br>information about<br>expressions how we're feeling<br>and<br>there are identified six supposedly six<br>basic uh emotions anger fear sadness<br>surprise<br>happiness and disgust in a typical<br>experiment you'd be presented with<br>a stationary static image of an<br>individual<br>with an expression on their face and you<br>have to label that expression<br>choosing from the six options<br>a variety of studies some of which were<br>professor ruffman's<br>um demonstrated that our ability to<br>engage in that emotional expression<br>recognition declines with age<br>so there's an age-related change in our<br>accuracy of emotion perception<br>and it looks like this when we have<br>those static<br>full intensity images provided by actors<br>the age<br>adults typically over the age of 60<br>struggle with identification of sadness<br>anger and fear<br>lesser difficulty experience with<br>happiness and surprise but difficulty<br>nonetheless<br>and no difficulty with disgust<br>and that's from a wide variety of<br>research over a period of time that's<br>been demonstrated<br>you might ask well is it just faces is<br>that emotional recognition<br>compromise in older adults exhibit in<br>other forms or modalities of emotional<br>expression<br>you can ask people to detect or identify<br>the emotion in a voice<br>you can ask them to detect emotional<br>expression in a bodily<br>body image through body language and<br>there are some examples there<br>you can ask people to match a particular<br>voice vocal expression of<br>a vocal expression of emotion two faces<br>and<br>match voices also to bodies and we<br>have created a battery motion tasks<br>exactly as described there<br>and what you find here's an example<br>that when you do ask participants to<br>engage in those motion recognition tasks<br>two main findings one older adults had<br>worse recognition<br>than young adults and bad news guys<br>men are worse at recognizing emotional<br>expression<br>than women and so this is some work we<br>did early on<br>uh includes melee dr meleto<br>who is now one of our colleagues and at<br>so that's a basic finding and that's<br>been replicated quite a few times<br>why might that be what is the source of<br>that age-related<br>decline in motion recognition one thing<br>we've been able to rule out is general<br>cognitive<br>decline so that is not responsible for<br>the decline in emotion recognition<br>i will add that all our wonderful older<br>adult participants<br>have suffered no neurological insult<br>they are capable functioning human<br>beings<br>so there are no uh other variables of<br>that sort that could be driving<br>the poor emotion recognition<br>what we think might or the or the<br>explanation that we are<br>most comfortable with shall we say is<br>that there are age-related reductions in<br>brain volume and particularly<br>in the areas of the amygdala or orbital<br>frontal cortex the anterior cingular<br>cortex<br>and the fusiform face area so reductions<br>in those areas<br>are reductions in areas of the brain<br>that are linked<br>to our emotion processing capability and<br>face recognition abilities<br>another possibility and another aspect<br>of change is reduction in<br>neurotransmitters<br>and i'm going to talk about one<br>neuropeptide oxytocin<br>which is a particular neuropeptide that<br>can increase communication in across a<br>range of brain areas involved<br>in emotion recognition including the<br>amygdala<br>and the anterior cingular cortex earlier<br>workers suggested<br>that neuro peptides such as oxytocin<br>when administered<br>to individuals who are less socially<br>able<br>that results in better emotion<br>recognition at least for young<br>adults we reasoned that if the<br>there was a reduction in neuro<br>transmitters in older adults<br>knowing that men have less oxytocin and<br>that older men have worse<br>recognition we wanted to explore the<br>possibility<br>that providing a dose of oxytocin<br>to older and younger adults that the<br>worst group would result in benefit from<br>that<br>oxytocin oxytocin administration and<br>that would be namely<br>our older male adults and that's what we<br>did we had<br>administered oxytocin nasally either<br>or uh half of course the participants<br>received a placebo<br>and the task was to label expressions of<br>emotion<br>following the standard um six<br>emotions this is part of the phd work<br>and what we found is shown there so<br>oxytocin facilitated emotion recognition<br>in the group with the worst recognition<br>it is the men the older men showed some<br>benefit of<br>the oxytocin uh it improved their<br>emotion recognition but notably it did<br>not bring them still up to the level of<br>their counterparts in the young adult<br>group<br>so while oxytocin did help an assist in<br>emotion recognition<br>suggesting that may play a role in<br>the change in adult<br>emotion recognition it certainly would<br>not be described as<br>a definitive answer certainly changes in<br>volume of brain areas and other changes<br>in transmitters reductions and<br>neurotransmitters<br>play a role what i want to turn to now<br>is to talk about the implications that<br>might arise from these changes<br>in our ability to perceive emotion as we<br>get older<br>other day-to-day aspects of our life<br>that might be compromised in some way by<br>this reduction in ability to perceive<br>emotion<br>here are some examples that we actually<br>explored<br>knowing when to stop talking when you<br>wrap it on for a while<br>you might think well i need to be able<br>to be able to pick up those cues that<br>say<br>we're done now i'm really not interested<br>in what else you have to say<br>so perhaps the ability to recognize<br>emotions is related to picking up some<br>of those subtle cues<br>judging appropriate and inappropriate<br>behavior and what inappropriate<br>when people express or engage in<br>behavior that's socially inappropriate<br>some of the information we use when<br>we're<br>deciding whether it is a faux pas or not<br>is<br>the response from the people uh and<br>surrounding that individual who's<br>engaging in<br>potentially uh socially inappropriate<br>behavior<br>so we have to pay attention to what the<br>other individuals are<br>are expressing are they looking<br>displeased are they looking annoyed<br>disgusted<br>are they looking pleased so we have to<br>pick up some of those subtle cues<br>when we're judging appropriate<br>inappropriate behavior and finally<br>telling truth from lies<br>how good can we be at detecting whether<br>or not someone's telling a lie<br>probably have to pick up some pretty<br>subtle cues uh<br>is this person looking uneasy for<br>example<br>so i'm going to just tell you about<br>those the three experiments that address<br>those questions the first one is<br>verbosity<br>stopping talking when you've been<br>talking too much<br>we had individuals come into the lab<br>both old and older and young adults<br>and they were asked to<br>describe or converse with a interview<br>and interviewer<br>we videoed with permission the<br>individuals participating recorded<br>their conversations and the amount of<br>talking that they did<br>and to measure verbosity<br>we could measure the total talk time we<br>also<br>measured the proportion of time the<br>individual spent off topic<br>so did they wander when talking about<br>their mother to talking about their cat<br>or the<br>or the boy down the street and the<br>degree to which they were off topic so<br>how far did they wander off topic<br>and those videos were rated for those<br>components<br>by two independent coders<br>what we found was older adults were more<br>what we also found because we had<br>engaged in an emotion recognition task<br>with our with<br>our participants that<br>the findings that i described you<br>earlier were for the findings from this<br>study<br>older adults had worse emotion<br>recognition and men<br>had worse recognition motion recognition<br>than women<br>particularly fine grain now older men<br>but not<br>older women's verbosity was related to<br>poor<br>emotion recognition so the men who were<br>older men who were struggling with the<br>emotion recognition task<br>were the individuals that tended to be<br>more off topic<br>and wander farther away from the topic<br>than any other<br>faux pas um i'm<br>faux pa that was an easy one<br>we just went to the office<br>and we found many opportunities to<br>get short little video clips depicting<br>inappropriate social behavior<br>our faux pas and a number that we're<br>depicting<br>appropriate social behavior task is very<br>simple for our participants this time<br>just simply rate whether or not on this<br>scale from zero to 100<br>the behaviors and not socially<br>appropriate at all or<br>entirely socially appropriate<br>we also had our participants of course<br>carry out an emotion recognition task<br>finding<br>the usual events that older adults had<br>worse recognition than young<br>and men had worse recognition than women<br>what about our faux pas so there are the<br>faux pas results<br>and what's evident there is that younger<br>people<br>young adults were much better at<br>discriminating<br>socially appropriate from socially<br>inappropriate behavior<br>such that they<br>were more likely to rate the control<br>appropriate behavior<br>as being appropriate and less likely to<br>rate the faux pas<br>as being appropriate relative to the<br>older adults<br>so there seems to be a relation there<br>and what we went on to look at<br>is to look at that relation and we<br>entered in<br>the data for our age group data and<br>looked at how well<br>it would predict the appropriateness<br>ratings of faux pas so remember<br>how the degree to which you say that<br>faux pas behavior is appropriate or not<br>and we found that age group did a good<br>job of predicting<br>the faux pas ratings<br>but when we entered in the emotion<br>recognition variable<br>what we found is that emotion<br>recognition<br>strongly predicted faux pas and uh<br>faux pas perception and engendered or<br>sorry probably<br>rendered the age effect non-significant<br>so emotion recognition fully mediated<br>the age difference in faux pas<br>discrimination<br>caution note of number one this of<br>course is not causation<br>and this is a cross-sectional study so<br>in order to be able to have a little bit<br>more um confidence in the cause<br>and the direction of the effect we would<br>want to see this work<br>replicated in a longitudinal study<br>okay consistent with the idea that<br>people are not picking up those subtle<br>cues of the listeners around them to<br>judge<br>whether or not behavior is appropriate<br>or not<br>third category of question deception<br>telling truths from lies in this<br>instance we had<br>older and adult older and young adults<br>come into the<br>lab and they were asked to express<br>whether or not they<br>what they felt strongly about around 12<br>different issues and as an example stem<br>cell use is ethical<br>once we found out the uh strength of<br>belief in<br>individuals we carve them up into groups<br>uh older and younger adults in equal<br>numbers<br>and ask them to tell a story or answer<br>these questions that you see<br>for issues that they were very much<br>strongly in agreement with<br>versus issues that they were very much<br>strongly not<br>in agreement with with to incentivize<br>our people in their lying state<br>we offered them a nice little monetary<br>prize at the end for the best liar<br>and that seemed to do the job<br>so we filmed these individuals and then<br>shared<br>those um video clips<br>with our older and younger<br>adult participants and ask them to<br>simply say do you think this person is<br>lying<br>or telling the truth the first thing<br>that we found is<br>unrelated directly to the question we're<br>looking at but nonetheless interesting<br>older adults are not very good liars<br>they are relatively transparent as liars<br>and<br>both young and older participants<br>found it easier to differentiate truths<br>from lies<br>when the person relaying the story was<br>an older adult<br>more interestingly for our present<br>question<br>is what was found regarding the ability<br>to discriminate truth from lying and<br>what we<br>found was that older adults are<br>generally worse<br>at adjudicating truths they found it<br>they find it harder to determine whether<br>or not the story is true<br>or the story is false and that again of<br>course is relative to our young<br>participants<br>similarly we looked to see the the role<br>of<br>age group and emotion recognition<br>tasks because of course our participants<br>carried out an emotion recognition task<br>as well<br>and we found that again age group<br>predicted<br>lie detection but when emotion<br>recognition was entered in<br>to the model that wiped out the age<br>group<br>significant effect and emotion<br>recognition fully mediated<br>the older adults worse emotion<br>recognition<br>so that's the bad news okay so as we get<br>older<br>it seems that we are going to<br>reluctantly<br>be not as accurate in our perception of<br>emotion in faces<br>and in bodies and in voices<br>it may get us into a little bit of<br>trouble because we may not be able to<br>have that information readily at our<br>fingertips<br>to do things like detect lies when<br>they're being told<br>when people are wanting us to shut up<br>and when we are<br>adjudicating whether behavior or<br>expression is<br>um socially or in or acceptable or<br>not one thing we wanted to look at<br>and and this will be the positive bit of<br>the talk um<br>was what doesn't sound like it from the<br>title of stereo<br>type threat is<br>is there a possibility that some of the<br>poorer performance we're seeing in the<br>older adults<br>results from the fact that they think<br>they're going to be lousy<br>and stereotype threat is a very real<br>phenomenon<br>evoking negative stereotypes about<br>members of a group<br>results in worse performance on a<br>variety of stereotype relevant tasks<br>easy example is if you tell females that<br>they're about to do a math task<br>and they feel that they are as a group<br>not as capable mathematically than<br>than males they will suffer the<br>consequence<br>and perform worse than if they are not<br>advised of that stereotype<br>so it may well be and we know with older<br>adults that<br>in terms of cognitive ability there is a<br>very much widely held stereotype<br>regarding<br>ability to remember new material or<br>memory tasks<br>as we get older and those do impact on<br>participants performance so we thought<br>we would look to see is there any<br>element of stereotype<br>threat in the findings that we see with<br>our older adults with regard to emotion<br>recognition<br>we crafted three stereotype threat<br>conditions<br>and by we i mean<br>atkinson murray and halberstadt and this<br>was leanne<br>atkinson's phd work<br>we frame the emotion recogni recognition<br>task is a cognitive task as a social<br>task or as a control<br>task and that was really what we shared<br>with the<br>participants when they came in and they<br>served in one of these three conditions<br>and for the cognitive stereotype threat<br>we which we were trying to elicit<br>they were advised to the purpose was to<br>examine people's cognitive ability at<br>different ages<br>both young and old were being tested so<br>that sets up you're going to be pitted<br>against the<br>young folk if you're an older adult<br>participant for the social framing<br>it was the purpose was to examine<br>people's social ability<br>at different ages both young and old are<br>being tested again<br>trying to set up a potential stereotype<br>threat<br>and in the control condition it's the<br>they were advised the purpose is to<br>examine people's ability<br>on various tasks different types of<br>people are taking part so no particular<br>stereotype<br>being created there this time we use an<br>emotion recognition task<br>which i'll refer to as the multi-modal<br>dynamic<br>emotion recognition task this is the<br>gert the geneva emotion recognition task<br>we use the short version version and it<br>consists of positive emotions some of<br>which are listed here<br>and they are produced by an actor but<br>these are dynamic<br>so the actor is given emotional<br>expression let's say<br>pride and they have to express<br>pride within a nonsense syllable so the<br>word has no meaning they have to<br>provide a tone in that word that<br>suggests pride they have to use their<br>body<br>to express pride and they have a facial<br>expression also consistent with<br>that expression of pride so there's<br>multiple<br>information about the emotion<br>and it's presented dynamically as<br>first of all to the stereotype threat<br>did it work<br>were we able to elicit a feeling of<br>threat regarding<br>the various three conditions that we<br>presented the answer is for older adults<br>yes<br>and we know this because after they<br>carried out their experiment and they<br>did their emotion recognition task<br>they were asked to rate were you worried<br>that your ability to perform well on<br>these tasks was affected by your<br>age and the second question were you<br>worried that if you perform poorly on<br>the test<br>the researchers would attribute your<br>poor performance to your age and they<br>had to rate<br>on a scale so what you can see there is<br>that<br>older adults well first of all young<br>adults they didn't care they were not<br>threatened at all<br>yeah meh whatever the older adults<br>felt particularly threatened when the<br>task was framed as assessing cognitive<br>ability<br>so they were more threatened compared<br>to the social condition and the control<br>condition<br>what we found of course was then the<br>question was does that stereotype threat<br>now that we've demonstrated that it was<br>elicited<br>impact on the older adults ability to<br>recognize the expressions that they were<br>presented with in<br>the gert s videos and the answer was<br>it did had no impact whatsoever<br>so older adults felt threatened they<br>felt they might do<br>worse in the cognitive framing<br>but that had no impact on their emotion<br>recognition performance<br>so i think that's in part the good news<br>because it suggests<br>that in a context<br>where they can feel threatened they may<br>be resilient enough to psychologically<br>come<br>come over bypass that threat in order to<br>perform emotionally<br>successfully here are the emotion<br>recognition performance which is the<br>second part of the<br>the good story remember<br>up to this point we repeatedly finding<br>evidence that older adults particularly<br>men<br>struggle with emotion recognition and<br>perform poor<br>relative relative to their younger<br>counterparts<br>in this experiment we saw no difference<br>between young and older participants<br>when identifying negative emotions<br>and indeed in the case of positive<br>emotions<br>the older adults were doing better than<br>the young adults<br>good news for us over 60<br>older adults were indeed performing<br>better why might that be<br>well a couple of things i think one is<br>that we have<br>dynamic multimodal displays used in this<br>experiment<br>so there's a wealth of information<br>available there's a wealth of<br>information<br>around both body void or all three<br>face body and voice and that maybe<br>uh there's a resilience in our<br>perceptual processing that allows us to<br>integrate that information<br>more successfully and so that suggests<br>uh information that we process in our<br>day-to-day lives<br>occur not as a matter of a static image<br>on a screen<br>but involve context that we can perhaps<br>use<br>to overcome some of these difficulties<br>in emotion recognition<br>secondly um with regard to the younger<br>participants<br>being outperformed by the older adults<br>in the positive emotions<br>this is consistent with a theory<br>put forward by carstensen called the<br>social emotional<br>selectivity theory and basically this is<br>the good news story<br>we as we get older the theory is that we<br>become more<br>selective and what we want to attend to<br>and we become selective by<br>looking and attending to things that are<br>positive and make us feel good<br>there's evidence to suggest that that<br>that a positivity effect seeking out<br>positive information<br>impacts significantly on memory<br>performance<br>and perhaps here what we're seeing is<br>some form of that<br>social emotional selectivity in action<br>again<br>signaling that maybe there's a certain<br>resilience that we can recall upon<br>that's the end and i want to finish<br>with some acknowledgments and first of<br>all<br>i would like to acknowledge big d and<br>little d<br>so those are my two sons damian and<br>daniel<br>damien was born after my second year of<br>undergraduate study<br>so he's known nothing but a mother who<br>studies and works<br>academically and little d daniel<br>was born after i did my post-doc so he<br>similarly<br>knows nothing other than a mother who<br>studies and<br>works academically so i'd like to<br>acknowledge their part<br>in being patient with their mother all<br>the way through and allowing me to<br>to engage in doing what i love the<br>woman there is my grandmother and her<br>name is jean murray<br>and she was a remarkable woman<br>and you can probably see how remarkable<br>she is by just looking<br>at the spark and intelligence in that<br>face<br>of a 92 year old woman<br>so she was mighty fine speaking of<br>remarkable women<br>i'd like to thank my partner sally<br>and thank her for walking alongside me<br>each<br>and big thanks to lots of people here<br>and<br>outside this room department of<br>psychology is my home<br>department you can hopefully most of you<br>can see they're fairly exuberant<br>bunch expressive emotionally<br>when good things happened and sometimes<br>when bad things happen<br>and those are so i'd like to acknowledge<br>all my colleagues in the department of<br>psychology both<br>past and present of which we have quite<br>a few past members there<br>i particularly want to thank our<br>professional staff<br>in the department of psychology we have<br>the best technical team<br>in the entire world and we've always had<br>the best administrative team in the<br>entire world<br>they are very much part of what we do<br>and the research that we produce in that<br>department owes<br>a great vote of gratitude to all of<br>those people<br>i want to thank the university of otago<br>for giving me a job<br>and letting me stay here also for<br>us supporting through funding the work<br>that we have done in my lab<br>many projects of which i have not spoken<br>of tonight but i<br>very much appreciate that support<br>collaborators other than the ones that i<br>have<br>acknowledged through the talk tonight<br>which there are many here and overseas<br>research assistants always got to thank<br>the research assistants who come in and<br>do the hard work<br>with us and sometimes don't get much<br>acknowledgement<br>students and i mean all students and i'm<br>including those students that i would<br>teach at undergraduate level the<br>students that come into the lab and<br>undergraduate and our postgraduate<br>students<br>they all have taught me a great deal<br>regardless of<br>the encounters that we have so i'm very<br>grateful to<br>that opportunity to constantly be<br>presented with new ideas and fresh<br>faces each and every day participants<br>they are due a huge vote of thanks and<br>gratitude<br>obviously our undergraduate students who<br>we<br>make use of to participate in our<br>experiments and we do<br>so with great gratitude but i<br>particularly want to thank the older<br>adults who have come into our lab at the<br>university<br>and participated they've freely given up<br>time in their very busy lives i remember<br>some of my students would come in and<br>say i can't get a hold of mrs so-and-so<br>and she wants to come in but she's too<br>busy they had this<br>crazy notion that old people put their<br>feet up and do nothing all day<br>they are very busy people and we've had<br>participants as old as 90<br>years of age come in and and take part<br>in our experiments and they do so<br>because they are<br>curious um yes<br>this has been a great place to work um<br>it's not many<br>instances where you can get up every day<br>and say<br>i'm happy to go to work today this is<br>one of them<br>so that's all from me kiara thank you<br>all for your attention<br>um<br>koto<br>a proud head of the department of<br>psychology<br>i am pleased and honored to be a part of<br>the<br>academic party and it definitely is a<br>party with these people<br>supporting the inaugural public lecture<br>of my longtime friend and colleague<br>professor<br>as janice mentioned i've been i've been<br>privileged to work alongside<br>her for many years both literally<br>because we had our<br>offices adjoining for about a decade<br>and then also figuratively as<br>collaborators<br>so psychology is a very diverse field<br>the american psychological association<br>has some 50 or 60<br>divisions everything from cognitive<br>psychology which i guess you'd<br>probably define yourself as a cognitive<br>psychologist to<br>you know military psychology which i<br>don't know what that is<br>but they're all but and then there are<br>many divisions within divisions so<br>even though we all study the workings of<br>the mind<br>it's also sort of rare to be able to<br>find someone<br>in a relatively small group with<br>sufficiently overlapping and<br>complementary interests and that's why<br>it's been so one reason it's been so<br>gratifying to work with<br>janice and our other uh i don't know if<br>ted is here ted ruffman<br>as janice mentioned um we you know<br>brought our<br>our uh respective backgrounds and<br>expertise together<br>janice brought her knowledge of<br>cognition and face perception i<br>had some background in emotion<br>recognition ted development and theory<br>of mind<br>and together i feel like we created a<br>new academic<br>niche i guess a theoretical pathway from<br>aging<br>to perception to emotion<br>to social deficits and and perhaps also<br>eventually to well-being um<br>what i like about the account that<br>janice presented<br>today is that it uh it reduces a set of<br>seemingly<br>uh complicated and disparate phenomena<br>to a simple<br>mechanism holistic face perception<br>so deception uh verbosity social<br>relationships<br>faux pas um violation of social norms<br>these are all<br>sort of somewhat ill-defined uh concepts<br>uh skills that you know quote older<br>adults<br>tend to struggle with i think it's<br>interesting<br>i put this in quotes because it's<br>interesting that social norms actually<br>make it a little bit difficult to um<br>to sort of put labels to where the<br>boundary<br>between old and young is so it's very<br>easy for me you know i can say like all<br>you young people raise your hands it's<br>no problem but if i<br>say hey old people let you know raise<br>your hands<br>it's a little bit little sort of cruder<br>and thus the you know thus we<br>use the term older adults so<br>don't you're not old it's just you're<br>just a little older than you might<br>otherwise have been<br>when you were when you were younger and<br>actually it's interesting<br>that i noticed that we once we ourselves<br>started to approach<br>the older boundary which is as you've<br>seen as<br>we usually use a 60. um we did start<br>thinking<br>maybe there's a older category even<br>above<br>that so we started and this is actually<br>one of the one of the interesting<br>contributions janice didn't talk about<br>but<br>but we we kind of unusually were able to<br>study more recently<br>what we call i think we call older older<br>adults<br>so as we're approaching the older we're<br>don't worry there's always someone older<br>um okay anyway in any case<br>whatever your age these are<br>these social skills that janice talked<br>about are<br>they're all associated with different<br>perceptual<br>cognitive sociological neurological<br>maybe even evolutionary different<br>accounts but genesis model suggests that<br>they all could arise from the same<br>mechanism um the same thing that signals<br>that someone is lying to you<br>might be this that might be the same you<br>know these are the subtle emotional cues<br>that leak from someone's face these<br>might be the same<br>cues that you know you should be looking<br>for when someone<br>really wishes you would would shut up<br>and<br>um and both of these depend i was<br>um anyway and that's and and um<br>both of those all of these depend on<br>holistic<br>face processing potentially and that's<br>the skill that maybe changes with age<br>that's the<br>i think the key you know fascinating<br>insight<br>um why does holistic perception<br>suffer well you know i don't think we<br>ever<br>fully got to the bottom of that it might<br>be biochemical<br>hormonal neurological changes that janus<br>alluded to could be something even<br>simpler<br>i think i think it was ted<br>who looked at eye tracking studies of<br>older adults and found that older adults<br>are a little bit biased to to look at<br>the<br>mouth people's mouths when they're<br>talking or when they're when they're<br>viewing them and there's<br>um a reason that you can imagine why<br>that might be<br>um and i you know i think<br>that um you know i love the idea that<br>the reason you know i feel increasingly<br>out of step<br>with modern life is just has to do with<br>a simple and correctable<br>hearing loss so of course these ideas i<br>mean these may or may not be true<br>uh but genesis model is clever it's<br>generative<br>and most importantly i think your<br>students<br>and colleagues will continue to test<br>these ideas and that's about the best<br>legacy<br>that an academic can leave so these are<br>the sorts of insights that<br>uh and discoveries that um drive<br>academics in janus<br>as you heard is a born academic uh<br>but unfortunately she's also apparently<br>a born<br>academic dean and the university and<br>sciences division<br>in particular has come to rely on her on<br>your your equanimity um<br>fair-mindedness and attention to detail<br>especially<br>going through the covent period<br>so it's not to say that janice doesn't<br>enjoy this role because i know you do<br>but i want to acknowledge that part of<br>service really is<br>is sacrifice bob dylan<br>said he just turned 80. he's an older<br>older adult himself<br>he said it may be the devil it may be<br>the lord<br>but you're going to have to serve<br>somebody and all of us<br>in this room are grateful that<br>it was we that you served for so well<br>and so long<br>so uh since i am actually am still young<br>enough<br>uh barely to know when to stop talking<br>i'm gonna stop<br>uh stop here i just wanna say janice<br>kappai<br>congratulations on your ascension<br>and thank you for your good work<br>friendship and<br>service um i believe<br>do we have i think we have a gift<br>and um is anyone else speaking besides<br>me okay so we're gonna<br>all right so i guess i'm supposed to<br>invite us invite all of you<br>over to the staff club is that right for<br>canopies probably<br>all right thank you all for coming we'll</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
