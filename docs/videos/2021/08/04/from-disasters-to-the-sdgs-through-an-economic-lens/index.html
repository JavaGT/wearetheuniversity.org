This is also true even in a prosperous country like Aotearoa New Zealand. Professor Ilan Noy will consider how disasters are linked to the SDGs and how economic analysis can help us prepare better for these events, mitigate their impacts, improve recoveries, and thus also contribute to the achievement of the SDGs.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so today's seminar is a seminar that is<br>particularly focused on climate change<br>and<br>the disaster domain more broadly<br>professor ilano is our chair in<br>the economics of disasters and climate<br>change and he will look at disasters<br>through the lens of or through an<br>economic lens but with a specific focus<br>on the sd on the sdgs<br>so<br>the way that we tend to run these<br>seminars there we go sorry that was a<br>bit of a delay<br>is that<br>our speakers who are chairs funded<br>chairs in a particular discipline they<br>don't necessarily talk directly at the<br>research on the sdgs but they relate<br>their extensive research to the sdgs to<br>have a common uh roadmap and a common<br>way of communicating around some of<br>these challenges that affect new zealand<br>as they affect many other parts of the<br>world<br>and<br>elon's presentation will specifically uh<br>make reference to the sdg-1 no poverty<br>sdg 8 decent work and economic growth<br>and sdg 13 climate action<br>but in a quick preview of his<br>presentation i saw i think he might<br>speak to more than just those three<br>which of course is uh it's enriching<br>um so i hand over to<br>elon to talk about<br>the sdgs and disasters through an<br>economic lens thank you very much thank<br>you thank you christian<br>and thank you for um<br>coming can you hear me<br>yeah<br>um my intention is to speak for maybe 40<br>minutes or so and then leave plenty of<br>time for questions<br>but if you want to stop me for a<br>question or a clarifying query or<br>something like that then please feel<br>free to<br>stop me<br>at any time<br>as christian mentioned i'm i'm an<br>economist and i usually apologize for<br>that<br>um but um that is the the lens i'm going<br>to use<br>to talk about disasters uh the link<br>between disasters<br>in this case we have i use this picture<br>because we have a volcano here<br>we have um typhoon as well going on so<br>there's plenty of action there um<br>and then to link between those events<br>like typhoons and um volcanic eruptions<br>now the sdgs as you know<br>include under 17<br>development goals<br>when i try to<br>you know<br>put together this presentation i try to<br>think okay which which of these sdgs are<br>directly relevant to what i do in terms<br>of my work on on disasters and climate<br>change and actually i found it a lot<br>more than than just the three that we've<br>originally<br>highlighted and i actually<br>blocked only three as irrelevant maybe<br>and even those are not strictly speaking<br>irrelevant so i'm not going to go<br>around and already talk all about the<br>about all of these sdgs one by one and<br>and describe to you how<br>um they relate to what i do but rather<br>just give you some uh general um<br>insights or a few insights that i think<br>are<br>irrelevant<br>okay we start actually with number 17<br>um and that's the the idea of of<br>partnership for the ghosts the idea that<br>we need to do this<br>this together<br>um now if we look at um at disasters<br>2015 was a very momentous year not only<br>because<br>we agreed on the sdgs in 2015 but we had<br>three other international agreements at<br>the same year<br>right<br>we had the paris um climate change<br>agreement um agreed in at the end of<br>2015.<br>we also had the sendai conference on<br>this after risk reduction<br>which was uh held earlier in that year<br>in march 2015 in which we signed and we<br>i mean new zealand<br>is a signatory to the sendai agreement<br>uh for disaster risk reduction and we<br>also had the um the financing for<br>development conference in in addis<br>where we also agreed to various<br>benchmarks in terms of how much we<br>should<br>invest<br>in in this<br>this goal for development<br>now i said<br>sort of hinted that maybe<br>we made a lot of promises in 2015<br>and we're not quite on track to<br>fulfilling them to fulfilling those<br>promises<br>um<br>clearly in terms of the sdgs while we<br>possibly were on track before<br>when was it that covet 19 emerged<br>the end of december 2019 or um<br>january 2020<br>we maybe we're on track to do that after<br>the last<br>you know<br>year and a half horrible year and a half<br>we are very far away from the achieving<br>the sdgs but also the other one the<br>other ones i think we are we're not<br>quite doing what we promised we will do<br>in 2015. okay in terms of the financing<br>for development um<br>basically most countries promise to<br>donate at least 0.7 percent of their gdp<br>that actually goes back to the<br>millennium development goals before that<br>we are very far from that we meaning new<br>zealand is far from that<br>but<br>i think new zealand is not even reaching<br>50 percent of that<br>um<br>but most other countries i think there<br>might be three countries in the world<br>who reached that<br>um<br>used to be the uk but now boris<br>johnson's got that um but um it's then i<br>think the netherlands denmark and<br>finland<br>norway maybe<br>um<br>so it's the usual suspects right<br>and<br>in terms of the sendai agreement we've<br>committed to various things around<br>sendai<br>the very basic thing was we commit to<br>telling you how much disaster is<br>damaging our economy<br>um and we haven't even achieved that<br>if we look at what disasters do to the<br>economy of new zealand<br>um or how much damage they reek in new<br>zealand we have no idea so what was the<br>sort of the bill surrounding the floods<br>last week in westport<br>i think we will never know<br>uh because we don't do the accounting<br>for that we don't count that we don't<br>know how much the floods in canterbury<br>in ashburton where<br>how much damage they<br>caused a couple of months ago<br>we don't collect that data we just don't<br>so we don't know so even the very basic<br>thing of just counting so we know<br>whether we are doing disaster risk<br>reduction we're not quite doing<br>um<br>hopefully eventually we will get there<br>in terms of<br>climate change i think<br>anybody who opens the paper you know<br>that we're not quite there in terms of<br>our commitments to the paris agreement<br>not with new zealand but the world<br>in terms of climate action so climate<br>action is part of the sustainable<br>development goals<br>it's kind of a weird<br>goal because it talks about action<br>rather than some kind of a<br>outcome<br>but<br>um i just wanted to show you this<br>because i<br>you know it's the tokyo games are<br>um running now<br>so it's an interesting piece of data<br>that is um what you see there on the<br>graph is the day in which<br>the sakura the cherry blossoms blossom<br>in the main temple in kyoto every year<br>now the nice thing about that is we know<br>exactly when that happened and we have<br>continuous record of that since<br>812<br>okay<br>um so every year's in a since 812<br>they they they record the date in which<br>the cherries blossom in in<br>kyoto so you clearly see that something<br>is happening<br>in the last um<br>in the last century right it's becoming<br>earlier every year<br>okay the cherry blossoms is blossoming<br>earlier every year now if you want to<br>really be a be convinced<br>that something is happening then look at<br>the data for this year<br>this year<br>the peak was in 26th of march<br>that's the earliest it has ever been<br>recorded in kyoto<br>okay the the<br>earliest day and since in the past what<br>is it 1200 years<br>um<br>it has never been 26 of march<br>there were i think a couple of years<br>where it was the 27th of march<br>um<br>about a thousand years ago<br>so<br>where there is something going on<br>okay<br>but for me actually what is interesting<br>about climate change<br>is it's not<br>the<br>average temperature that is going down<br>that is worrying<br>okay and it's not even the average<br>um or or for that matter sea level rise<br>that is going up it's the the fact that<br>the frequency and intensity of extreme<br>events is changing<br>that is the important issue with climate<br>change now here on the um on the slide<br>um i have data from a paper we did on um<br>new zealand floods<br>and we look i don't have the labels on<br>the columns so forgive me for that but<br>that's why i can explain that to the to<br>you so there's a bunch of floods that<br>happen in the last um<br>10 years or so a bit more than 10 years<br>um 15 years maybe these are the<br>costliest floods in the last um<br>15 years but not including the ones in<br>the last couple of years so<br>you know my guess is the one in westport<br>last week would go into this list<br>as some of the costliest floods<br>including and the one in ashburton as<br>well<br>and then this column here<br>shows you roughly what is the<br>contribution of climate change to that<br>to to that event so those events became<br>more likely by about<br>most of them by about 30 percent some of<br>them less some of them more<br>okay i'm not going to get into how they<br>calculated that but anyway i didn't do<br>that that's climate scientists uh people<br>who are much more skilled than i am i<br>told you i'm just a lonely um lowly<br>economist um<br>but then we we look at the damage from<br>these floods and this is only the<br>insured the privately insured damages<br>from those floods<br>we multiply the two and we get this<br>number<br>which is those floods<br>uh uh the climate change footprint of<br>those floods<br>in new zealand<br>in the last 10 years is about 140<br>million<br>new zealand dollars<br>okay<br>these are rough numbers don't you know<br>it doesn't really matter if it's 140 or<br>160.<br>but that's that's the<br>that's the climate change footprint of<br>those floods<br>okay<br>now why am i telling you this because<br>those floods the climate change<br>footprint of those floods is a lot more<br>than for example sea level rises cause<br>damage to new zealand up to today<br>okay i'm just trying to convince you<br>that the important<br>component of climate change for us<br>is the changing frequency and intensity<br>of extreme events and here we're talking<br>mostly about<br>floods strong wind events and droughts<br>all of which are predicted to become<br>more frequent and more intense in new<br>zealand<br>and a lot of the public discussion sort<br>of talks about sea level rise the<br>incredible amount of discussion in new<br>zealand is talking about sea level rise<br>and<br>climate changes if that is the big risk<br>for us<br>that's not that's a big risk for<br>bangladesh and it's a big risk for<br>tuvalu and kiribati but it's not a big<br>risk for us the biggest risk by far for<br>us is those<br>changing frequency and intensity<br>of extreme events<br>okay<br>one more piece of evidence i think<br>that's relevant to this idea of climate<br>action and why we need to do climate<br>action now<br>this is sort of hot off the press from a<br>paper we're just finishing now it's<br>actually not on the press yet it will be<br>on the press<br>it will be it's on the press now it will<br>be off the press soon<br>um<br>this is from uh hurricane harvey<br>in uh houston in the u.s<br>um in 2017. so they had a big event a<br>big hurricane you might remember that<br>that 2017 was a horrible year for<br>hurricanes there was three big<br>hurricanes um irma which went to florida<br>harvey which went to houston and then<br>maria which devastated puerto rico<br>now what we did there is we looked<br>at the contribution of climate change to<br>the flooding that occurred because of um<br>because of hurricane harvey in houston<br>so what you see here there's basically<br>we looked at all the houses in in<br>houston<br>about a million 1.1 million houses okay<br>for each one of them we could classify<br>them whether they were<br>not flooded but a million were not<br>flooded so only a hundred thousand<br>houses were flooded<br>um<br>like i say only with a sort of a<br>a caveat there right um<br>but between those those houses that were<br>flooded there were two types of houses<br>ones that were<br>anyway would have been flooded even if<br>we had no climate change<br>but climate change made<br>that flooding more severe because it<br>increased the level of the water<br>um and those houses that we'd have<br>climate change<br>wouldn't have been flooded<br>there would have been hurricane harvey<br>but with climate change that would<br>without climate change there would have<br>been less rain and therefore less<br>flooding and therefore those houses were<br>not flooded so roughly about a hundred<br>thousand houses were flooded in<br>hurricane harvey roughly half of them<br>were flooded because of climate change<br>the precise number is forty nine<br>thousand and fifty one thousand but<br>let's stick with one half is good enough<br>right<br>and what's more striking about that<br>is that<br>these houses<br>the ones that were flooded were much<br>more likely to be owned by hispanics<br>than um<br>than the houses that were not flooded so<br>the the<br>both the storm and climate change hit<br>the hispanic population<br>disproportionately to their share in the<br>population okay now worse than that<br>relative um generally speaking if income<br>was higher<br>in houston for um<br>homeowners not income sorry the the<br>value of the house was higher they were<br>more likely to be flooded because they<br>were more likely to be living next to a<br>water you know river or or a canal or<br>something like that but that<br>relationship switches when you're<br>talking about um hispanics<br>okay so when you're talking about<br>hispanics the lower income hispanics<br>were more likely to be<br>so hispanics were hit low-income<br>hispanics were especially hit<br>and worst of all<br>um<br>houston and the us in general<br>has this<br>rule that if you are within the flood<br>plain<br>then you should you are required to buy<br>flood insurance<br>so basically most properties within the<br>flood plain have flood insurance and<br>most properties outside the floodplain<br>do not have flood insurance right flood<br>insurance is sold separately from<br>regular insurance so here in new zealand<br>we have<br>all hazards lumped together<br>in the us they separate flood insurance<br>separately for historical reasons<br>so what we find is<br>first of all the maps are not that good<br>so a lot of houses that were<br>in the flood plain did not flood and a<br>lot of houses that were not in the flood<br>plain did flood<br>they did<br>experience flood damage<br>and all the disparity before hispanics<br>is from those properties that are<br>outside the floodplain<br>meaning they were uninsured<br>okay so not only hispanics were more<br>likely to be flooded<br>it's more likely that low-income<br>hispanics were flooded and more likely<br>that low-income hispanics without flood<br>insurance<br>were flooded okay<br>so what i'm trying to tell you is<br>the general message is climate change<br>has a very unequal impact<br>across different groups in the<br>population and we need to drill into<br>that to be able to understand what is<br>going on and if we want to if we care<br>about the sdgs then obviously you're<br>here so you do carry care about the sdgs<br>we need to take that into account when<br>we design policies okay<br>we hope to replicate the same kind of<br>analysis here in new zealand for places<br>like ashburton and<br>um<br>and um<br>in westport<br>um but<br>there's a lot of there's a lot of data<br>that needs that works behind this um<br>this kind of um<br>work<br>okay<br>that's about um um<br>climate action now<br>when i was trying to decide okay what<br>i'm trying to link<br>disasters and disaster you can think of<br>geophysical disasters like earthquakes<br>and mass movements of<br>what they call dry mass movements of<br>soil or volcanic activity or you can<br>think of meteorological disasters<br>whatever type of disaster<br>you want to think about including<br>epidemics by the way it's a disaster<br>like all these other disasters<br>um<br>why why and how are disasters important<br>to the sdgs which and which sdgs i want<br>to most emphasize well i actually want<br>to emphasize mostly one two three and<br>four<br>why because as an economist i think<br>these are the most important ones<br>they're basically the ones that are used<br>by the un<br>when they're doing their human<br>development index right the human<br>development index which you might be<br>familiar with<br>looks at<br>health<br>wealth and education<br>right<br>and basically sdgs one two three and<br>four<br>are are that and sdgs one two three and<br>four are directly impacted<br>okay so how do i know these things first<br>in a survey<br>um<br>public opinion<br>survey international public opinion<br>survey on the sdgs<br>basically the top three<br>reasons<br>that<br>respondents said<br>was<br>a barrier to achieving the sdgs<br>the first two are lack of political<br>leadership and lack of awareness<br>these are kind of for me<br>that are a bit vague<br>and unhelpful<br>um<br>i i once knew a<br>political scientist who talked about<br>um<br>well<br>when when other people say<br>um<br>there's no political will to do<br>something he said it's like the economy<br>is saying there's no<br>the economy is not growing because<br>there's no economic will for it to grow<br>it's meaningless statement<br>okay and when we talk about no awareness<br>or no lack of leadership these are also<br>meaningless statements why is there no<br>lack of leadership why is there no<br>why is there lack of awareness and<br>among people and policymakers<br>so i think these are not very useful the<br>third one is of course what i'm trying<br>to<br>talk to you about<br>okay<br>these major shocks that are the problem<br>with sdgs um with achieving the sdgs are<br>these shocks and we've seen that in the<br>last 16 months<br>right maybe we were on track and we can<br>argue about that maybe we were on track<br>on achieving the sdgs but suddenly we<br>got whacked completely whacked off<br>course<br>uh with with the pandemic<br>okay another sort of piece of evidence i<br>want to try and convince you this is um<br>thanks to um gerald the um the head of<br>the head of your school<br>um<br>so this is the um<br>gdp per capita in the uk in the last<br>bit more than a thousand years<br>um<br>you see something quite striking in this<br>figure right<br>um<br>so it's hard not to notice that<br>something<br>different has happened since the 19th<br>century right<br>now what girol has pointed out and i<br>think is very interesting if you look at<br>gdp growth<br>in the last thousand years<br>okay<br>what's this is the uk right this is the<br>graph for the uk i'm doing it for the uk<br>because it's one of the only countries<br>for which we have gdp growth for a<br>thousand years<br>estimated from various things but you<br>know and it<br>takes some<br>um<br>eat it with a large grain of salt<br>because you know there's a lot of<br>assumptions that go in there but what's<br>striking here<br>um for me at least<br>um is that the big difference what what<br>is happening after the 1800<br>that that led to this dramatic shift<br>okay<br>the episodes of high growth<br>were there even before<br>what's unique after 1800 you don't have<br>these declines these shocks<br>these episodes where you are<br>i don't know if this works and anybody<br>can see it<br>but you don't have these episodes of<br>very large declines in income<br>after 1800 we largely managed to not<br>have those anymore that's the big<br>difference<br>we managed not to have those shocks<br>rather than to grow faster<br>okay that's why the economy of the uk<br>has been growing so<br>since since the 1800s not because it's<br>the episodes of high growth are higher<br>but because the episodes of there's no<br>longer episodes of large declines in<br>economic activity okay so if we can<br>manage to<br>prevent the cost of these shocks<br>these disasters<br>um then we can achieve the sdgs without<br>preventing that we're not going to be<br>okay<br>one sort of another answer why can<br>disasters how come they have this impact<br>on<br>the metrics of the sdg here i'm talking<br>about<br>wealth health<br>and education so the the basic metrics<br>um of the human development index<br>um two potential issues that come up<br>when with disasters um one is disasters<br>sometimes cause<br>a change in the political system and and<br>they um<br>they manage to throw society's um<br>asunder<br>uh in some way and can be very very<br>destructive so oftentimes sometimes<br>there can be beneficial right so some in<br>some instances we have where disasters<br>somehow instituted a change that was<br>positive<br>okay the meiji restoration in japan is<br>an example of that it happened after a<br>series of earthquakes<br>um<br>which led to loss of<br>confidence in in the traditional<br>authorities and led to the meiji<br>restoration<br>or at least that's one interpretation of<br>what led to the major restoration okay<br>but in most cases we see that disasters<br>actually cause the opposite and they<br>cause institutional um change that is<br>very harmful<br>the uh the the<br>the etching there is from the lisbon<br>earthquake in 1755<br>the lisbon earthquake was probably the<br>first international disaster in the<br>sense that it's the first one that<br>generated international aid<br>significant international aid it was a<br>terrible disaster there was an<br>earthquake offshore um<br>offshore in portugal um this was done it<br>was in all saints day in the morning so<br>everybody was at home cooking um<br>of course cooking on open fire the<br>earthquake happens a fire started in the<br>city um so you have the destruction from<br>the earthquake then you have the<br>destruction from the fire everybody in<br>this bond ran to the river down to the<br>river because there was a fire and then<br>a tsunami wave came up the river<br>okay so a terrible um a terrible event<br>which also led to various institutional<br>changes in in portugal initially<br>positive changes<br>um but eventually um<br>reversed completely and maybe even made<br>things um worse for portugal<br>yeah<br>so so one issue is the fact that<br>disasters are a shock to the<br>uh institutions that govern societies<br>and can be very very negative shocks<br>another example maybe of a negative<br>shock is is the iranian revolution<br>in 79 which happened after an earthquake<br>about 10 months before the revolution<br>and a lot of commentators at the time<br>point to the earthquake as the beginning<br>of the revolution in iran if you look at<br>income per capita in iran<br>um afterwards it's probably declined by<br>about 60 to 70 percent<br>um that's a huge decline<br>in in income per capita<br>um<br>the other thing is that<br>earth<br>disasters in general shake<br>our confidence in the future or shake<br>the confidence of a lot of people<br>potentially in the future um<br>example for that<br>um<br>at least in my view is san francisco<br>san francisco used to be the by far the<br>largest city and the most thriving and<br>most dynamic city in california<br>um until it is hit by the 1906 um<br>earthquake<br>so the 1906 earthquake hit there's a big<br>fire all of the area that we now know as<br>chinatown in san francisco gets burned<br>um<br>and<br>at the time they don't really understand<br>earthquakes so plate tectonics is still<br>50 years away<br>in terms of our understanding of why<br>earthquakes happen so people don't<br>understand what's going on and they<br>realize that this area is risky and we<br>see an economic shift in california to<br>los angeles<br>and basically since then los angeles is<br>um is is the sort of the dynamic<br>engine<br>of the state of california and you can<br>you can<br>easily date that shift<br>to that to that 1906 um<br>earthquake so i think without the earth<br>we doubt<br>the 1906 earthquake the map of<br>california would have been very<br>different in terms of where people live<br>where is economic activity it starts to<br>be reversed only in the 1980s and 90s<br>when high tech emerges out of stanford<br>and we get silicon valley you know and<br>all of that and we start to get more um<br>more economic activity in san francisco<br>but you know san francisco in the 1960s<br>was where all the hippies went because<br>it was a very cheap poor place to go<br>um it was much cheaper than la so they<br>went to san francisco even though the<br>weather is much nicer in l.a<br>so um disasters and<br>here we're talking about you know good<br>70's 80 years of negative impact on on a<br>city<br>um so disasters can have those long-term<br>impacts and again if we want to achieve<br>the sdgs we need to worry about those um<br>long-term<br>adverse impacts<br>well in utero exposure um is incredibly<br>important<br>uh we know that from you know child<br>development<br>what happens to a child in utero is very<br>important and<br>the first three years are also very<br>important but we have for example um<br>striking research<br>from uh peru<br>so in peru they had in 1970 they had an<br>earthquake in an area called ankash<br>and what people have done maybe five<br>years ago or so they looked at the<br>census data from from peru<br>and looked at people who were<br>in utero during the earthquake<br>in ankash<br>okay and what they found that these<br>people as adults<br>had less education<br>and less income<br>than comparable groups so comparable<br>groups were people who were born just<br>you know a year or two later in unkash<br>or born at the same time but in other<br>places in peru<br>okay<br>so just exposure in utero to the<br>earthquake<br>um was<br>led to an average one year less of<br>schooling<br>which is very significant and of course<br>corresponding to that lower income<br>okay now the striking thing about that<br>they could also follow the next<br>generation<br>so they could follow the generation of<br>those people who were born<br>to people who were in utero during the<br>ankash earthquake<br>okay<br>so incidentally the anchorage earthquake<br>was in 1970<br>i was born in 1970 so<br>sort of um if i were in peru i would<br>have been in yotora during the<br>earthquake um<br>my kids right basically my kid you can<br> they follow um that generation<br>and that generation if their mother<br>was in utero in ankashi 1970 that<br>generation had half a year of schooling<br>less<br>okay so that impact continued to the<br>next generation why it's not<br>rocket science the by far the most<br>important determinant of how much<br>schooling you get is how much schooling<br>your parents got<br>right<br>uh so when we look across country<br>everywhere that's by far the most<br>important determinant right so if now<br>clearly in interestingly there it's only<br>through the mother if the father was<br>exposed to the uncashed earthquake that<br>didn't matter much but if the mother was<br>in utorrent during the ankash earthquake<br>there her kids<br>would be less educated so this is 50<br>years later<br>we still have an impact from that<br>single um earthquake so again if we have<br>these long-run um concerns<br>uh then<br>you know without dealing with that<br>problem you're not going to deal with<br>the sdgs<br>um<br>there's other issues there's issues like<br>child labor so we know that that<br>disasters push more kids to to uh<br>towards labor uh towards um child labor<br>so again we will have those you know if<br>if a kid is pulled out of school<br>that that is going to have an impact<br>that will last for generations<br>right<br>um<br>in terms in terms of education um and we<br>as i said you know next generation and<br>so on so if we don't deal with these<br>issues of disasters we will have more<br>kids being pulled out of school and we<br>have plenty of evidence i had a phd<br>student for example who did work on<br>indonesia<br>and showed that that<br>educational attainment in<br>um areas that were hit by disasters and<br>indonesia is blessed with various types<br>of disasters<br>volcanic eruptions earthquakes floods<br>droughts everything you can imagine<br>um<br>so<br>if your um community was hit by a<br>disaster your left<br>the average educational attainment went<br>down now averaging educational<br>attainment will<br>go on to the next um<br>generation okay<br>um<br>the picture by the way if you're<br>wondering is my son<br>whom<br>arthur knows um<br>existential risk i think we are we are<br>at least one thing that i sort of um<br>learned from the last i think i learned<br>from the last um 18 months<br>is that we don't we're not very good at<br>thinking carefully about the risks that<br>we are facing we were hit<br>by a pandemic<br>that was<br>perfectly<br>expected<br>everybody anticipated that<br>in<br>sort of scenarios of what kind of<br>pandemic is most likely the highest<br>likelihood event was a coronavirus<br>emerging out of china<br>nothing very surprising about that<br>we have had another coronavirus emerge<br>in 2003 the sars<br>epidemic<br>achilles sars was<br>a lot less infectious<br>a lot much more deadly<br>but a lot less infectious<br>so<br>we have in<br>here<br>um<br>we we didn't expect<br>in terms of economics i think economists<br>have completely<br>missed the ball on this one okay there<br>has been very very very little<br>research in economics about the likely<br>impacts of an economic impact of a<br>pandemic okay actually at one point i<br>went online and checked<br>there's more papers written in economics<br>on baseball than on<br>pandemics<br>much more by the way<br>why because there's a lot more data on<br>and economies like data so so it's a<br>problem we we have all these existing<br>and<br>i note that this pandemic this specific<br>pandemic that has hit us<br>is a fairly mild pandemic<br>it's not very lethal<br>um<br>right it's less than one percent<br>mortality sars was more than ten times<br>as deadly<br>as kovid 19.<br>okay and the other thing from an<br>economic perspective<br>it you know imagine<br>what would have happened to the global<br>economy in global society if we had the<br>same<br>virus the same<br>mortality rate but hitting the young<br>instead of the old<br>the panic would have been<br>much higher<br>um<br>and<br>would have led to all these other<br>consequences i think<br>that would have been um<br>frankly<br>terrible to complica to contemplate okay<br>so the same event just<br>changing the structure of mortality<br>would have um the demographics of<br>mortality would have made a very very<br>big difference<br>okay now imagine of course a similar<br>pandemic with the mortality rate of of<br>of stars and not of uh<br>of course 19.<br>okay<br>so there's plenty of existential risk<br>and i think to some extent we are like i<br>mean the way i see this penguin um<br>he doesn't notice what's coming um i<br>don't know if it's true he might be<br>shaking in his boots but um<br>but that's the way i interpret this this<br>picture and i think to some extent we<br>are not thinking carefully enough about<br>the kind of existential risks<br>we are facing<br>and frankly if we are facing those<br>existential risks<br>we are not going to achieve if we<br>don't exist sdgs become a bit<br>meaningless<br>right um so we need to think about those<br>if we are worried about the sdgs we also<br>need to think about these things and we<br>now know that we had we should have been<br>thinking about pandemics a lot more<br>if we are worried about the sdgs<br>um some kind of<br>um<br>disasters that i you know we can see as<br>potentially um extinction risks<br>solar flares or something or solar they<br>call them solar storms or space storms<br>there can be incredibly damaging to<br>electrical grids<br>okay they might they<br>might not harm anyone but they<br>completely can destroy our electrical<br>grid now imagine our society if we don't<br>most people can't imagine themselves<br>without<br>their phone for an hour<br>imagine no electricity for six months<br>how do we structure our society<br>okay and and<br>solar storms can do that and they have<br>done that in the past so<br>you know electricity networks are around<br>for what a bit more than a century so we<br>didn't have<br>a solar storm that have<br>pulled our electricity but we had some<br>local events so there was one in siberia<br>a few um<br>a few years<br>ago and but it hit siberia who lives in<br>you know imagine the same event<br>happening in new york or some somewhere<br>like that<br>it's it's very difficult to really even<br>comprehend what we will do and what will<br>happen and how people will behave and<br>and and so on<br>and there's other risks that we can<br>think about um super volcanoes is one of<br>them<br>um<br>probably not much we can do about that<br>but solar storms we can do a lot so we<br>can we can have backup systems so that<br>we can<br>um<br>reconstruct our um electricity system<br>quickly<br>if if there is a stolen storm<br>um<br>biological risks and we i mean as i said<br>you know pandemics can be a lot more<br>awful than covet 19. coming 19 is<br>actually quite a multiple them pandemic<br>and the scariest for me at least is ai<br>artificial intelligence<br>we now have artificial um<br>we now have<br>sort of<br>robotic weapons<br>that can um independently um kill<br>i the technology is there<br>we use that all the time all these<br>drones that you know the americans used<br>to assassinate all these people in yemen<br>um<br>right now they are programming those<br>drones to not shoot if you don't if a<br>human<br>operator doesn't press a button<br>um but that's just a choice that they've<br>made to program it this way<br>the technology is there now for someone<br>to produce enough drones to<br>you know<br>um destroy humanity if they want to<br>um<br>the technology is already there this is<br>not<br>certain um<br>there's not some future<br>um risk this is current risk um and<br>we're not we're doing very little to<br>prevent that so all these things if we<br>don't think about them we're not going<br>to deal with the sdgs<br>um so we will we need to keep an eye on<br>those bars because if we are worried<br>about the sdgs<br>um<br>some<br>some optimism i think i need after this<br>um these messages um shakespeare was the<br>first pers uh the first person who used<br>the word disaster in the english<br>language<br>um this is from king lear<br>that we always um blame for our<br>disasters we<br>the the emphasis here is on our<br>disasters we are blaming<br>um the moon the sun the stars<br>um<br>so we are blaming everyone else other<br>than ourselves okay<br>while<br>principally<br>these are all<br>our fault<br>okay now that's a good that's an<br>optimistic message because if it's our<br>fault if these things are because of us<br>then we can do something about them<br>okay if it's just you know the wrath of<br>god or or or<br>as as shakespeare said heavenly<br>compulsion or<br>spherical predominance whatever that<br>means um<br>then then there's not much we can do<br>about it but shakespeare is trying to<br>say no it's not that it's our disasters<br>now that that insight is not<br>um is not new at least in economics it<br>who<br>is a<br>nobel prize winning<br>indian economist<br>he grew up in bengal in the<br>1930s and 40s<br>and he later on in the 1970s<br>um started to looking at the um at the<br>time in bengal when he was growing up<br>there was the bengal famine<br>which was a horrible famine<br>um killed probably between three and<br>five million people<br>um<br>and what he really and when he looked at<br>this event and made a lot of impression<br>of him as a young<br>child he grew up in a prosperous family<br>but he said he saw a lot of the<br>consequences of that famine<br>and what he realized is that<br>at the time of the famine<br>okay<br>well india was a british colony at the<br>time and the british overlords told it<br>to export food<br>okay<br>so for him<br>the famine it used to be thought of as a<br>sort of a<br>natural disaster<br>an event dictated by natural uh<br>forces a drought and so on um what he<br>discovered is no<br>um india<br>yes there was a drought so there was<br>some<br>you know fewer grain available in bengal<br>where he was growing up<br>but um other parts of india had no<br>drought and they were actually producing<br>more grain than in usual times<br>but they were forced to export that<br>rather than ship it to bengal<br>um<br>by the by the british<br>um and what happens in bengal is<br>basically<br>food became too expensive for the poor<br>to buy<br>okay so it's it's an economic event and<br>of course if a famine is an economic<br>event then you can solve it it's not a<br>natural disaster it's an unnatural<br>disaster<br>and and indeed he observed later that<br>india had a famine about every decade<br>during british rule<br>and not a single famine since<br>independence in 1947.<br>nothing<br>okay<br>and it's not as though droughts suddenly<br>stopped in india<br>after 1947.<br>um so disasters are always<br>unnatural events and if there are<br>natural events we can solve them<br>okay so if we are if we can solve them<br>why aren't we solving them<br>um<br>and here there's plenty of research in<br>in what we call behavioral economics<br>um<br>that<br>talks a lot about the ways<br>people humans think<br>um and behave<br>uh which prevents us from<br>oh<br>yes um i've been talking too much um<br>so<br>yeah i'm just going to skip this but but<br>the point is there's all these issues<br>like neopia and amnesia and availability<br>and i can talk more about if we have<br>time for questions we do have a bit of<br>time for questions<br>yeah yeah yeah okay so i will just<br>end with eor<br>um who observed that we haven't had an<br>earthquake lately and that's good we<br>haven't<br>and apologies for um keeping an eye on<br>the time but i suspect there are some<br>questions and we we do have some<br>questions that have come in through zoom<br>from australia and from elsewhere but i<br>would like to start by um<br>offering up the opportunity to ask<br>questions to the room<br>we can go to zoom if that's that's<br>preferred<br>we should be able to bring them up here<br>so the first question that came up<br>which i now can't locate on here sorry i<br>and this question is um<br>given the increasing frequency and<br>intensity of climate change related<br>natural disasters and on the basis of<br>the costs associated with that<br>has there been any study to look into<br>the net saving if any once countries<br>achieve net zero emission zero emissions<br>and the number of years it takes to<br>reach the breaking point given the<br>amount of investment required in the<br>first place<br>no<br>um<br>there hasn't been quantification of that<br>so<br>if you look at the<br>economic estimates of the cost of<br>climate change<br>okay<br>they typically ignore<br>or almost completely ignore the cost of<br>extreme events<br>they just look at the<br>what will be the impact of the change in<br>the average temperature<br>or or what will be the impact of sea<br>level rise okay and they completely<br>almost completely in some cases they<br>sort of add a multiplier there so i<br>think the north house<br>model which is maybe the most<br>well-known model of the economic cost of<br>climate change has adds another 10 or 15<br>percent to their calculated cost<br>associated with extreme weather events i<br>think they are vastly underestimating<br>that<br>okay<br>now<br>um<br>with those estimates which and<br>you know underestimate<br>the cost of ex the climate change<br>associated costs with extreme weather<br>events<br>um<br>the cost for mitigation for um<br>greenhouse gas emission is is the<br>benefit cost is still um clearly on the<br>side of<br>we should be mitigating okay<br>the economist magazine actually just<br>this week came up with a<br>with a scenario of what the world will<br>look like in a three-degree world and<br>they completely emphasize the extreme<br>weather event costs<br>so i think<br>to some extent economies have been<br>looking at the wrong place<br>why have they been looking there because<br>where do you look for the keys you look<br>under the streetlight<br>right<br>that's where the data was that's that's<br>the same reason they<br>do research on baseball um<br>so they they estimate they mis<br>they missed this<br>okay now<br>we only in the last<br>six or seven years have<br>starting to have this quantification by<br>of<br>how much the frequency and intensity of<br>these events is changing okay so we<br>couldn't really do this kind of economic<br>research 10 years ago because the<br>scientists were not there yet in terms<br>of understanding the changing frequency<br>and intensity now they are now we can do<br>this kind of um<br>analysis<br>thank you and yes i thought there might<br>um<br>you said right at the beginning that we<br>don't actually know the cost of<br>a lot of these<br>um<br>i mean the public finance act really<br>requires government to estimate that on<br>the balance sheet each year and i think<br>the local government equivalent probably<br>does as well it doesn't necessarily come<br>from private sector damage and it may be<br>that they're just<br>that's the fiscal cost<br>you're talking about the fiscal cost<br>well the fiscal cost now i'm interested<br>in that the balance sheet costs<br>the reduction in essay<br>but that'll be related to the fiscal<br>cost<br>so i haven't<br>seen<br>estimates of specific events<br>no you have to go into the<br>into the balance sheets to see what you<br>can see there but what i was going to<br>say was<br>in the<br>infrastructure<br>30-year strategy that we're doing from<br>the infrastructure commission<br>we have tried to quantify<br>the impact on extra required<br>infrastructure as a result of<br>anticipated extra climatic abuse it's<br>quite significant but of course that's<br>endogenous in one sense as well because<br>it does depend technologically on what<br>is possible and what we develop over<br>that time as well particularly with<br>regard to so-called green infrastructure<br>you know natural ways of draining<br>waterfalls and things like that<br>yeah<br>okay<br>would you like to respond or could we<br>squeeze in one more question yeah please<br>yeah but just just to clarify for for<br>for ellen um so what i'm i'm arguing is<br>there hasn't been there isn't we are not<br>doing<br>careful accounting of how much we are<br>actually spending there might be<br>projections<br>um about how much we are likely to spend<br>um as<br>not just fiscal not just fiscally but<br>generally in in this side the only sort<br>of<br>data we have is from the insurance<br>council how much insurance is is paying<br>private insurance and we also have the<br>public insurer<br>um<br>but<br>and each you know some some units in<br>government have their own<br>you know<br>um and that ta for example has their own<br>numbers for for the network of roading<br>and how much did that but we don't have</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
