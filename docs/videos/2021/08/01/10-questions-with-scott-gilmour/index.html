otago<br>and today we have the pleasure of<br>welcoming scott gilmore successful<br>entrepreneur angel investor<br>and founder of the non-profit i have a<br>dream<br>charitable trust in new zealand now<br>scott the first question<br>we're interested in is what did you<br>actually study at university and how did<br>your degree<br>prepare you for the real world i did a<br>be calm<br>back in the mid 70s and uh loved it<br>and it's given me a springboard for the<br>rest of my life actually i went on and<br>did<br>an mba when i lived in the states but<br>yeah the bcom was just a good grounding<br>for the rest of my life<br>uh so scott you have been quoted as<br>saying university can be powerly<br>formative<br>otago woke me up intellectually socially<br>and emotionally<br>why did otago have such a profound<br>effect on you as a student and after<br>graduation<br>well you have to realize felicia i come<br>from of cargill so anything's going to<br>be an upgrade from that right sorry to<br>all my individual friends<br>no but you know you leave home at the<br>age of 18 and you come to otago<br>you stay in the hall of residence and<br>you go flatting and it's<br>it is an intellectual awakening doing<br>classes but it's also a social awakening<br>you you're exposed to different people<br>different points of view<br>and and it's um it's a great grounding i<br>think it kind of<br>takes the edges off some kurds it builds<br>out the character it does a lot of<br>development of any individual that comes<br>here<br>you are a founding member of the ice<br>angels network now the next question<br>we've got<br>is how do you how did you form this<br>network and why is it important<br>look it's uh it's a very important group<br>to have because<br>startup companies especially in the tech<br>space need growth capital<br>you know i don't know if you've studied<br>this in your courses yet but the stages<br>of funding uh<br>you know first yourself your mortgage<br>your home you spend your savings or<br>whatever<br>then you hit the three f's friends<br>family and falls<br>and then you go to angel if you need<br>more growth capital<br>you get retired or active investors<br>to come and help and it's not just money<br>but it's mentoring and support<br>and resources and networks so there were<br>some<br>sort of informal angel networks in<br>auckland when i'd come home from the<br>states<br>and i met a few key people uh like andy<br>hamilton<br>and others and we formed the auckland<br>ice angels<br>in the early 2000s and it was a great<br>experience and we've seen since then<br>tens hundreds of millions of dollars<br>being invested in start-up companies<br>uh who has been a significant business<br>mentor mentor for you and why<br>look i've had many mentors over my life<br>and and i think that's important for<br>both my career and any young person or<br>even older people<br>you're having a mentor or somebody<br>that's<br>that's wise and that you can access for<br>support and they can give non-judgmental<br>advice<br>i would say my first mentor was dad<br>actually he was a successful businessman<br>and he was the one that actually got me<br>into computers it was kind of like that<br>movie you know<br>dustin hoffman and the rain whatever<br>that movie was where the guy said<br>plastics<br>well my dad said computers and i went in<br>and started selling for burrows when i<br>came out of my<br>otago training so uh that and then<br>various<br>managers over the course of my career i<br>worked at intel for 12 years which is a<br>full of really smart hard-working people<br>and it's not just older more you know<br>senior people<br>your mentors can be in your network or<br>even people that report to you<br>there's wisdom distributed throughout<br>society throughout an organization<br>and i think it's important and you<br>realize as more as you get older<br>to access that pool of wisdom yeah for<br>sure<br>thanks scott so following on from that<br>what attributes do you actually look for<br>in<br>graduate recruits look uh i've done<br>as much hiring in new zealand myself as<br>extensive as some of my colleagues<br>but you know what you're looking for is<br>a well-rounded person<br>and because it's nowadays in most<br>companies or non-profits or<br>government organizations whatever you're<br>running you want people that contribute<br>to a team output and you need lots of<br>skills to contribute to term output<br>communication is absolutely key so you<br>can be so smart but if you can't<br>write or talk to your teammates it's<br>going to be hard<br>right being out there be able to<br>advocate<br>part of communication as well being able<br>to network being able to<br>research data analyze data present data<br>manifold skills so that's what you're<br>looking for<br>and some some of these things are come<br>from your training<br>some come from your personality okay<br>thank you uh what should students be<br>doing to enhance their skill set for<br>employment<br>outside of achieving good grades well<br>that leads on from the last answer is<br>there's so many things in life that we<br>can do to make ourselves better<br>more rounded more complete people and<br>more able to contribute to a group<br>outcome right so<br>joining a sports team i would argue is<br>very important you know being able to<br>become<br>less selfish and more part of a team<br>ethos as<br>a skill for any place you're going to go<br>in life<br>being pushing yourself from new<br>boundaries is good<br>so if you've never been skiing or<br>tramping or rowing<br>or whatever these things are give it a<br>shot and i think the university here is<br>great you know when<br>my kids came through are looking through<br>this the hall and saying gosh look all<br>these clubs you can join<br>what a fantastic opportunity to broaden<br>your horizons you don't need to stick at<br>it but you should give it a go<br>how do you measure achievement and why<br>look i think um and again things evolve<br>as you get older right when<br>when you start out in life you're single<br>then you get married then you have a<br>family<br>and we tend to look inwards at those<br>points you know<br>how's my career going how much am i<br>earning can i afford a house can i<br>afford a car<br>can i afford a good school for my kids<br>but then as you get older you think<br>you know there's more to life than just<br>my own insular world or my own whanau<br>so living in a community contributing in<br>that community i think is very important<br>as we go forward what is one piece of<br>advice that you would like to share with<br>soon to be otago graduates<br>enjoy your time here make sure you<br>thoroughly<br>go out and experience everything you can<br>and then bottle that up and take it with<br>you and carry that enthusiasm you have<br>as a student<br>into your life and i think that's a key<br>here be enthusiastic about life<br>go out and do great things because<br>everybody can do great things<br>thank you very much for your time scott<br>you've been giving us some really good<br>insights<br>thank you it's been lovely to meet you<br>both and i wish you all the best in your<br>careers yeah thank you so much for your<br>time</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
