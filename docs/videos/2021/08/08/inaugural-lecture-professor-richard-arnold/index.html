inaugural<br>professorial lecture of richard arnold<br>professor of statistics and data science<br>in the school of mathematics and<br>statistics<br>my name is professor grant guilford vice<br>chancellor of tahereh victoria<br>university of wellington<br>new zealand's globally ranked capital<br>city university in new zealand's top<br>ranked university for the intensity of<br>high quality research<br>it's my pleasure to host you all this<br>evening<br>i'd like to briefly introduce professor<br>arnold before handing over to him to<br>deliver his lecture<br>richard has carved a fascinating path<br>throughout his academic career<br>and this journey gives him a singular<br>perspective on his areas of interest<br>professor arnold began his academic<br>career focusing on astronomy<br>completing his bachelor of science in<br>astronomy with first class honours and a<br>master of science and theoretical<br>physics<br>with distinction at the university of<br>canterbury<br>he went on to complete his phd in<br>astronomy at the university of cambridge<br>he was a european space agency external<br>fellow<br>and european union human capital and<br>mobility postdoctoral<br>research fellow at the observatory<br>located at leiden university in the<br>netherlands<br>and his research at that time centered<br>on the structure of galaxies and the<br>orbits of stars within them<br>he then discovered statistics<br>initially in the field of environmental<br>risks to health and was so taken with<br>the field he decided to pursue it as his<br>primary area of focus<br>he completed a second master of science<br>this time in statistics<br>and operations research at taharingawaka<br>and worked as a mathematical<br>statistician at statistics new zealand<br>before returning to our university in<br>2001<br>to take up his role as a statistics<br>lecturer<br>he became a professor of statistics in<br>data science in 2019<br>professor arnold has attracted<br>significant research funding for his<br>work applying a statistics perspective<br>to a diverse range of research topics<br>including fisheries geophysics and<br>cluster analysis<br>he has made very significant<br>contributions to his field<br>through books and journals and has<br>written influential reports for a number<br>of government<br>agencies he is dedicated to<br>communicating his research with the<br>wider public and has participated in a<br>range of public talks aimed at<br>demystifying<br>statistics it's also been the new the<br>television new zealand election night<br>statistician<br>for four general elections<br>richard has contributed widely to the<br>school of mathematics and statistics<br>including his deputy head of school and<br>program director for both statistics<br>and data science he has lead the<br>development of the curriculum for the<br>data science undergraduate major<br>and has been a strong advocate for and a<br>participant in<br>the university's academic mentoring<br>program<br>he is an enthusiastic postgraduate<br>supervisor and uses his diverse<br>knowledge to supervise a wide<br>in this lecture professor arnold will<br>discuss some of the statistical<br>questions he works on<br>including seismology clustering and<br>reliability<br>he will reflect on his own journey from<br>astronomy to statistics and will explain<br>how statisticians<br>think about the world and why their<br>thinking seems to be so different to<br>everyone else<br>he will comment on the growing presence<br>and significance of statistics<br>in the modern age alongside the paradox<br>of public distrust<br>and evidence please join me in welcoming<br>this is a very difficult lecture to<br>write<br>there's so many different types of<br>people here so many different interests<br>so many different parts of my life are<br>represented<br>thank you to my parents for coming<br>through we flew from christchurch to<br>wellington<br>through that storm this morning at one<br>of the most exhilarating landings<br>as ever thanks to my husband julian<br>for being himself<br>um<br>i didn't know quite as i said what what<br>to include in this lecture so what i'm<br>going to do is i'm going to dance around<br>through various different aspects of<br>my journey of the research that i've<br>done and<br>what it's meant to me and and also i've<br>had the unique experience of<br>transferring myself from one discipline<br>to another and that's been<br>that is always something that's exciting<br>and informative and surprising<br>so that's how i came to my title um i<br>i'm distracted by shiny things new<br>things<br>and um consequently my my inbox is too<br>full<br>my list of things to do um too big<br>but it never stops me uh feeling joyful<br>about what i do<br>so before i start this is a question<br>my husband should have known that he was<br>looking puzzled he's from birmingham<br>well i dare say the building on the left<br>wasn't there when<br>when you were a child um the reason i'm<br>saying this is because i never really<br>thought this this lecture would ever<br>happen i want to<br>tell you a little story about that i<br>mean 1994 i was there with my parents at<br>this meeting the british association of<br>neurological surgeons<br>uh despite appearances i am not a<br>urological surgeon<br>my father however is and um uh the cross<br>keys you can see there are the cross<br>keys of saint peters and peter of the<br>rock the rock upon which the church was<br>built<br>and this is a pun this is the the rock<br>this is uh this is how your logical<br>system<br>uh identify themselves and i'm wearing a<br>tie with those same cross keys and from<br>that same association i stole this type<br>from my father some time ago<br>but i wear it not as a urological<br>surgeon but because the cross keys are<br>also the symbol of laden<br>the city i spent four years in um but<br>what some something very significant<br>happened to me<br>my mother and i my mother is here as<br>well um we went to the accompanying<br>persons<br>program i'd never done that before um<br>but we also went to the the conference<br>dinner very formal affair<br>toast to the queen and then you can<br>smoke<br>gentlemen may only remove their jackets<br>after permission of the mc<br>um but was sat next to an elderly polish<br>professor who said this<br>and i didn't believe that i was i said<br>yes<br>of course you can come to my<br>neighborhood i didn't believe<br>not not that he was perhaps not likely<br>to make it but<br>um for other reasons but that i it's<br>it's quite a thing to be asked to be a<br>professor not to apply to ask to be a<br>person be<br>then be granted the right to be a<br>professor and it really was something<br>that i<br>i don't take for granted in the<br>slightest i'm very grateful to the<br>people who've helped me along the way<br>and not to be performative about this<br>but as a straight not straight gay white<br>guy<br>i nearly said it as a white guy<br>cisgendered let's say that<br>um but who had a room to study in with a<br>desk and a quiet time living in a<br>peaceful country that wasn't at war<br>there are so many doors that i walked<br>through that i didn't realize were even<br>doors<br>so i i don't take that for granted<br>and think about the people who are not<br>able to stand here the way i am<br>um but i did as as grant just said um<br>start at the university of canterbury<br>doing astronomy<br>um and that was that was a truly<br>wonderful thing i did actually start off<br>in the engineering program that switched<br>to astronomy and kaelin murdoch once<br>said this to me<br>so kayleen the the the younger sister of<br>the soon-to-be<br>vice chancellor of the university of<br>otago and i we did physics honors<br>together<br>and she came in agitated state to the<br>honors room one day saying i think i'm<br>going to be time warped and what she<br>meant by that<br>is if i was transformed a thousand or<br>two thousand years back in time<br>what could i really tell them and when<br>you start to get deeply into a subject<br>like physics you realize how little it<br>is you know<br>even after studying years of it you<br>realize how little could you possibly<br>communicate to another what use would<br>and when i think about the dizzying<br>things i learned as a student<br>actually this wasn't as a student but<br>this is probably the most dizzying thing<br>i have ever come to know<br>the theory of natural selection i really<br>can't have everything i think is the<br>thing that is most extraordinary<br>that human knowledge has led to um<br>these of course the galapagos finches um<br>but if you if you want to get astronomy<br>in a phrase<br>a dizzying phrase this is the one that<br>does it for me<br>sun is a star and all the stars are suns<br>you stop and wait and think you're so<br>far down the line of what it means to be<br>an astronomer<br>and and the excitement that that brings<br>who knows what these equations are does<br>anyone know<br>put your hands up does anyone want to<br>shout out the answer<br>maxwell's equation so as a physicist at<br>a certain point you study<br>electromagnetism and you learn these<br>these formulae and um<br>that is quite a moment it's another of<br>those really amazing moments when you<br>put together the electric field of the<br>magnetic field and<br>the way they originate and the way they<br>vary in time and you realize that that<br>gives you<br>light and the<br>american institute of physics put out a<br>t-shirt<br>so i nearly bought but it was a little<br>geeky i mean you like the idea but then<br>you think<br>but but another dizzying thing is when<br>you you know the following year you<br>learn<br>the theory of relativity and you learn<br>relativistic quantum<br>quantum mechanics and relativistic field<br>theory<br>and suddenly these these equations<br>collapse into a form that looks like<br>that it is so beautiful when you watch<br>it happen<br>um deep into a subject you take a step<br>that is<br>that is dizzying so that that that's one<br>of the most remarkable things that i<br>ever saw as an undergraduate<br>um was was those equations when they<br>were first written up in front of me<br>um it's glorious when you see these<br>equations show how time and space<br>mix and how electricity and magnetism<br>really do<br>mix together and they are<br>indistinguishable from one another<br>and so much follows from that<br>um but here's something that um you can<br>prove<br>um some something dizzying that you can<br>prove about<br>something fundamental if you were to get<br>time warped at least 2500 years because<br>if you do any less than that aristotle<br>needs to beat you to it<br>so you can show that the earth is round<br>by<br>going to you looking up the sun going to<br>alexandria<br>and then 850 kilometers away to<br>aswan i was saying as it was um down the<br>nile in a north-south line<br>and you put up two sticks of equal<br>height<br>and you measure the shadows that they<br>cast<br>and you realize that the sun is at a<br>different elevation on the summer<br>solstice<br>in both places um and you realize that<br>then that the angle between the<br>the rays as they come down over the<br>stick is 7.2 degrees<br>that must be the angle at the center of<br>the earth between alexandria and<br>and if you do a very simple calculation<br>you basically derive divide 850<br>kilometers by 7.2 degrees converted to<br>radians<br>you get something which is extremely<br>close to the true radius of the earth<br>so if you are ever called upon to to be<br>time-warped and you want to prove<br>prove something surprising to to people<br>who are<br>around you you can do that and you can<br>do it in new zealand so<br>the districts from alexandria to us one<br>is about the auditions from auckland to<br>cheviot so not quite to christchurch<br>and this will help you if you meet a<br>here's another quote i've built this<br>talk around quotes<br>so here's a quote there's an empty quote<br>and this empty quote means a lot to me<br>um and i'm gonna explain why so jerry<br>gilmore was my phd supervisor<br>i went all the way around the world to<br>to have a new experience<br>and i ended up being supervised by<br>someone from christchurch<br>that was jerry gomer um so my my studies<br>were about<br>the faint very ancient population of<br>stars<br>that um that exist around this galaxy so<br>this is a disc galaxy our galaxy would<br>look like this if we were<br>and it collapsed from a massive gas<br>cloud<br>billions of years ago there were no<br>stars at that time the stars were<br>forming as that gas cloud collapsed this<br>is there were stars that forming<br>in that cloud spherically and those<br>stars are still alive today or some of<br>them<br>and they plunge in and out of the disk<br>rather than the younger stars like our<br>sun<br>which go in regular circular orbits<br>around the disk<br>these stars plunge in and out like<br>they're like a gas<br>they rush past each other and my uh my<br>thesis was about those stars in our own<br>galaxy<br>a particular subset of them and this was<br>uh<br>the biggest graph in my thesis so it was<br>um the x axis here is brightness so<br>fainter to the right<br>brighter to the left<br>and this is the velocity towards or away<br>from us<br>and the thing that that we noticed was<br>this group of stars<br>which were seem to be co-moving and<br>and it possibly indicated something<br>about the way our galaxy had formed in<br>the beginning<br>but the for perhaps rather than being<br>really chaotic it was clumpy<br>and that was a question at the time my<br>supervisor jerry is<br>being on the gaia project which has done<br>a mapping in 3d<br>velocities and space of the almost the<br>entire galaxy i'm a little bit too<br>scared to go and look at these five<br>stars<br>and see whether i got the answer right<br>or wrong i did actually think about it<br>and download the catalog the other day i<br>didn't have time to<br>lucky for me possibly didn't have time<br>to analyze it<br>so this became um one of my first more<br>significant papers<br>that attracted interest<br>um the story of the empty quote<br>so this is a a picture of the william<br>heschel telescope<br>on the canary islands and that's where<br>the data in that graph were taken that's<br>where they're observed<br>to get time on a telescope you write a<br>proposal and that goes to a committee<br>and they allocate you time and you get<br>your time and you go there<br>and if the sahara has had a<br>storm has happened to me and fired up a<br>whole lot of sand at high level and the<br>sky is yellow from<br>from horizon to horizon during the day<br>you're not going to see anything at<br>night<br>indeed we didn't and it was until the<br>first month of my<br>fourth year of my phd that i finally saw<br>the sky<br>at this telescope and this is the this<br>is the william herschel telescope it's<br>4.2 meters in diameter<br>reflecting telescope it's been well<br>superseded in size<br>since then but to get there you fly from<br>from<br>from luton unfortunately to<br>it's a small place for those of you who<br>have been to<br>luton airport um we fly to the canary<br>islands<br>and and i did that and then you fly to<br>tenerife<br>south and then you take a a trip to<br>tenerife north and that you get your<br>plane to<br>to palma so this is on on uh where the<br>observatory is<br>so so during this fire arrived and i<br>decided to idly look through my list of<br>objects and i realized i made a mistake<br>and i'd selected<br>all the wrong objects right so there's<br>all the wrong target objects so<br>they were not the correct stars that i<br>needed to so this was<br>a moment that i had um i was there on my<br>own<br>and in this hotel there it is<br>the very one um and suddenly i thought<br>i have to fix this i think i can fix<br>this you know we're observing the<br>following night i've got to get<br>to la palma so um of course you have to<br>to fly to la palma then you have to take<br>a taxi from the airport<br>to the residence on the on the uh<br>slopes of the mountain near the<br>observatory and then you have to get a<br>fiat panda which is<br>there's a fleet of them that the<br>arbitrary and get into one<br>before you can finally drive to the<br>building and get to the machine room so<br>this is the machine races the telescope<br>control room<br>i don't know if any of you have had<br>moments like this where you're just<br>thinking<br>i need time to contract i need to get<br>there i need to be there i cannot think<br>about anything any other thing<br>and so i thought well i'm going to<br>download across<br>the nascent internet this was very early<br>and download my uh the rights the right<br>set of objects from<br>back from cambridge unfortunately<br>telefonica<br>put a spade through<br>the the cable that can read the data<br>to the observatory so this was needless<br>to say somewhat<br>problematic um so i thought aha<br>well so this isn't going to work but i<br>wrote when i was packing<br>i had decided to put the magnetic tapes<br>in my bag now i had a moment<br>when i thought these are heavy objects<br>these magnetic tapes<br>there will be an uplink there when i get<br>there i don't need these magnetic tapes<br>they're<br>very annoying i won't put them in i<br>thought i'll maybe<br>so moral always put your magnetic tape<br>in your<br>i said i had it with me so i was able to<br>load it up<br>this is the way we used to do this it<br>was a copy of all my software<br>that i was going to need to reselect the<br>objects unfortunately<br>it didn't read it so i was panicking<br>again i got<br>lectured by the sisters administrator<br>about having done a verified backup and<br>then<br>you should go and verify that<br>everything's been copied correctly so i<br>always would do that but a different<br>machine did finally work<br>thank goodness and so i was able to<br>upload my software<br>reselect the objects and we were ready<br>in time<br>and all of this time my supervisor<br>jerry said nothing he sat on the far<br>side of the machine<br>room he didn't berate me or questioned<br>me had confidence in me that i could fix<br>it<br>and that absence of it of speech<br>absence of any kind of um<br>doubt that this was going to work out<br>that is what i valued from that moment<br>i'm grateful<br>to this day um to him for that<br>so easy i hope she is she not<br>so um it is magic<br>so i was i i met louise she was working<br>at the ministry education we talked<br>about policy analysis analysis<br>as you do in new worlds at least<br>miramanu welts is a hotbed of<br>discussions about policy analyst<br>analysis um anyway it is it is a magical<br>statement<br>that that you can take a small sample<br>and know something about the world this<br>is something<br>i'm not talking about my transition into<br>statistics clearly and this is<br>this is one of the magical things about<br>it um<br>and of course this led me into uh<br>something grant mentioned that i<br>i was the election night forecaster at<br>television new zealand<br>and there are two types of forecasting<br>one is a mugs game and one is not<br>this is the mugs game before election<br>day<br>interpreting opinion polls now life is<br>not as bad as people make out when they<br>talk about opinion polls<br>it's um opinion polls have had an<br>unfair and unfairly bad uh<br>wrap recently especially what happened<br>in the u.s and so on<br>the results are not as inaccurate as<br>they seem to be and in new zealand<br>particularly<br>we don't have a shy trump effect we have<br>a very high turnout in our elections<br>um we don't have the the incredible<br>um polarization exists in other<br>countries now<br>our political opinion polls are pretty<br>reliable<br>and of course what happens in those and<br>this is the magic is that you you have<br>the population of interest<br>you take a sample from it and the sample<br>resembles the population not exactly<br>but close enough if you do your sampling<br>correctly<br>you will get an answer that's close<br>enough<br>for your purposes do it badly of course<br>you'll get nonsense<br>but do it well and you'll get a good<br>answer what i did<br>was partial count of the actual vote so<br>this is<br>part way through the election election<br>night broadcast<br>which always starts at 7 pm on the<br>saturday of an election the<br>election counts start coming in the<br>election<br>the electoral commission puts on our<br>website and the media<br>outlets have got fast feeds to download<br>them and we get a a<br>account of how many people actually<br>voted<br>so um this is what it looked like<br>and i want to it's nigel nigel here<br>no he's not so nigel roberts on the<br>right was the person who got into<br>actually was meegan clarks megan clark<br>so nigel no so the the producer of the<br>tbnz program came to nigel because he<br>was a political<br>um political commentator he came to<br>meegan because he was someone he knew<br>megan came to me because he said<br>they need to find a new model for a<br>reason i'll explain megan came to me<br>uh recruited me in so i got got uh<br>involved in the 2008 election<br>nigel then the following election<br>bhagadov i was left on my own<br>doing this without his experience um<br>anyway i was i was mentally pleased<br>never to be asked a political question<br>on those broadcasts<br>um only a statistical one anyway and<br>that's sharon ferguson in the middle<br>she was this marvelous graphics operator<br>and reporter who helped<br>us through that broadcast anyway the<br>reason<br>we were asked was because this had<br>happened in 2005 i don't know if you<br>remember this<br>so from from 7 pm onwards we get the<br>partial count of the vote<br>in the new zealand election and<br>national is always ahead at the start<br>for for various reasons<br>um the principle reason being it's a<br>small polling places that get counted<br>first they they tend to be rural they<br>tend to vote<br>national and therefore the national<br>count is higher at the start<br>and always the game that the<br>statistician has to play is estimating<br>how far down the national vote will drop<br>from the account it's because the<br>polling places<br>are not reporting in random order<br>there's information<br>in the order in which they report and<br>that's what has to be corrected for<br>um television new zealand unfortunately<br>at about 9 p.m had decided that was it<br>it wasn't going to drop any further and<br>they called it for national and had to<br>reverse<br>their prediction so<br>so i when i was recruited i looked<br>looked into this uh subject and there is<br>a small literature on<br>forecasting elections and i found this<br>this warning<br>some people have seen this before it's<br>still a chilling warning<br>right so we can all agree if we're<br>economists or whatever we're forecasting<br>so this is this is what i i read on<br>the unmasking is swept so immediately<br>you're called on it right because you're<br>you're there<br>doing your professional thing and you've<br>so this is this is this was my um<br>my yes this is how i approached this<br>subject<br>um okay so i i steeled myself and got<br>into this game so there we are setting<br>up on<br>um for the election night broadcast<br>um and there i am<br>so those of you who perhaps knew me<br>during this time perhaps you didn't<br>realize<br>how flattery it was um i've done this<br>election four times and<br>every single time there's been a<br>significant significant technical<br>difficulty<br>and the last time i did it i had my head<br>on the desk thinking i cannot fix this<br>and the reason is the software is almost<br>impossible to test before you run it on<br>the night<br>um so you need to have a programmer<br>there<br>um ready to fix things if if you've<br>suddenly realized that some<br>communication isn't working and it<br>wasn't but um i realized i was being<br>paid to do this so i lifted my head up<br>and tried to make it work okay so this<br>is this is what actually happened on<br>2008. so<br>there was the count it dropped and<br>here's my prediction so it was flat<br>across<br>early on um we were able to predict<br>correctly the<br>the outcome the election so that was<br>with a confidence interval that nicely<br>um shrunk down to the truth so so that<br>that the model worked really really well<br>because of course there was no need for<br>i can take him okay so that that carry<br>on says here's 2011.<br>but unfortunately it's got no fun<br>anymore so this is 2017.<br>the reason it's got no fun is that the<br>new zealanders vote early now<br>in huge numbers so um in this election<br>2017<br>46 voted in advance in 2020 was 69<br>right so i was i i didn't even get a<br>phone call in 2020.<br>i don't think it was worth it in 2017<br>for them to call me about 20 20.<br>there's just no points anymore that game<br>is gone and tvnz were the last ones<br>trying<br>tv three didn't bother or instead didn't<br>martha is looking surprised um<br>i don't know if i'm paraphrasing what<br>you said martha but we were discussing<br>um some aspects of a phd student's<br>analysis and um<br>martha and her student and math was in<br>geophysics and is a fantastic<br>collaborator um when i collaborate with<br>her she<br>provides the geophysics and i provide<br>the statistics<br>um but it is clear that when when<br>statisticians talk to people who aren't<br>statisticians<br>there is a language deficit on both<br>sides<br>often um and part of it is caused by the<br>way that statisticians think and the way<br>that we<br>um we approach what we the<br>uh we approach our job um<br>so i thought i'd spend a little time<br>talking about how we see the world<br>so so i as a physicist coming into<br>statistics decided that<br>i needed to think about what the subject<br>was and whether<br>i could understand it in any systematic<br>way and i decided that<br>the uh the statistic all of statistics<br>in fact could be reduced to this<br>question<br>why isn't everything we've measured<br>exactly the same as every other thing<br>and there'll be two reasons it's<br>variation there'll be things that we can<br>measure<br>and things we can't and a statistician's<br>job is to do as best a job as possible<br>of incorporating the systematics so this<br>might be thing<br>something like in a health study<br>incorporating<br>asian sex perhaps or socio-demographic<br>factors or genetic factors or something<br>things we can measure and know about<br>and all of these when included they<br>remove the variation that's<br>left in the data and then finally we're<br>left with everything else things we<br>can't measure which are the life course<br>of those individuals<br>um particular diseases they may have had<br>and recovered from that have depressed<br>their immune system in ways we could<br>never even guess that<br>that variation is never going to be<br>discoverable and that's um<br>and that's what we spend our time<br>worrying about<br>so this is how we do it so<br>statisticians write down the<br>characteristics of<br>every possible world that could exist<br>you could say it's an overstatement in a<br>sense it is but but the way we do this<br>in a functional form<br>in the mathematical forms we say here<br>are all the things<br>that could make up the world this is the<br>way the world could be<br>in all possible forms and then we did we<br>we consider all the possible<br>observations that could come from all of<br>those possible worlds we do that<br>separately and that<br>the constellation of observations is<br>quite is quite different<br>from from these different worlds some of<br>the worlds are similar<br>lead to similar observations some to<br>very different observations<br>then we go out and we observe the world<br>we observe a red dot in this analogy<br>and then we look at the possible<br>observations we've seen we find which<br>possibilities match what we<br>what we've seen and then we go back and<br>we match them back to the worlds<br>that could have generated those<br>observations<br>so we start with all possible worlds<br>then all possible observations of all<br>possible worlds<br>and then we sieve that through the data<br>we've actually collected<br>and then we decide at the end of that<br>which is which world is most likely to<br>be the one we're living in<br>that's how we do it it's not more<br>mysterious<br>than that is that mysterious<br>i've done a bad job haven't i i missed<br>you at all<br>all right i want to be rude about<br>statisticians and physicists now and i<br>have a right to because i've been on<br>both sides of the fence<br>so i've got great respect for of course<br>both disciplines um<br>how many physicists have come a few<br>statisticians<br>so um physicists are super confident<br>about what they can do<br>they can write down a model for anything<br>they've got great<br>um great mathematics but they're very<br>cavalier about it<br>mathematicians might agree that um<br>so when i'm learning physics we the the<br>lecturer will be running on the board<br>saying have you guys come across this<br>before<br>and we'll go no and then it's roughly<br>like this and although<br>they'll do a crash bang very fast uh<br>derivation of some<br>um some result using mathematical<br>methods that<br>eliminate all the possible um difficult<br>cases<br>but physicists don't learn statistics or<br>at least they didn't maybe they do now<br>but i don't think they do because i was<br>just asked by a physicist<br>to help create a statistics course for<br>physicists<br>statisticians in the other on the other<br>hand<br>have a dizzying tool in their hands and<br>that is a theory of probability and it<br>is immense<br>it is fantastic the the the structure of<br>the reasoning that you can carry out<br>with probability theory<br>is is astounding the simplification you<br>can<br>simplifications you can make when you<br>construct a probability then a<br>conditional probability don't worry<br>about the details<br>they are it is it is tremendous<br>it clarifies problems it simplifies them<br>it enables the inference that i was<br>talking about before<br>associations has been many said many<br>times they play absolutely everywhere as<br>i have done and they don't seem to mind<br>if there's no causal model which<br>bothered me when i got into epidemiology<br>which this association will do<br>on we go<br>and they don't they but they think a lot<br>about counterfactual so the things that<br>could have happened but didn't and<br>that's what my earlier<br>graph was about and that there is a<br>the reasoning that comes the inference<br>that comes from knowing about<br>the worlds that never took place that is<br>uh<br>that's where the power of statistical<br>inference comes from<br>big criticism they don't really care<br>about the units like centimeters<br>kilograms whatever<br>um they don't seem to have noticed these<br>there is a huge amount of truth in this<br>statement<br>in fact in fact it is the averaging over<br>multiple observations that give<br>statistics it's real power<br>the smoothing out of variability from<br>one observation to another this is where<br>we see the real signal<br>one observation is no good to us we need<br>many many and they<br>uh they smooth out that variability and<br>then we get the signal then we get the<br>answer then we get<br>the insight except sometimes it doesn't<br>it's not as easy as that and i just want<br>to give you an example<br>so in directional statistics which is a<br>tiny field<br>but a fun one so i imagine you've got<br>three directions of the wind<br>one coming from the north one coming<br>from the eastern one coming from the<br>northeast and you average zero degrees<br>that's north 45 degrees<br>and 90 degrees you get 45 degrees you<br>get the red dot<br>this is very very simple right but just<br>shunt that<br>is everyone with me like 45 degrees yes<br>very good<br>i just shunt the northerly a little bit<br>to the west and it's now at 355<br>degrees and the average jumps down to<br>the south<br>for what is obviously a very dumb reason<br>and that's the location of zero on the<br>circle but the problem is you cannot put<br>zero everywhere you want it so it's<br>always away from the data you've got<br>it's always<br>there's going to be a mess somewhere you<br>have to use different methods and<br>this is the the first and motivating<br>example that takes you into directional<br>statistics<br>directional statistics are bound they're<br>all over the place um<br>i'll give you an example of a couple of<br>them so<br>if you wanted to carry out statistics on<br>the orientations of these objects on the<br>left<br>that wasn't the word i was thinking of<br>but i'll take it<br>or on the right that's diopside so it's<br>a crystal it's got a cubic structure<br>highly symmetric if you're if you're<br>doing an electron back scattering<br>experiment where you're measuring<br>the orientations of lots of little cubes<br>which is effectively what the surface of<br>that object looks like<br>um the fact that they're ambiguous you<br>can that object that<br>the orientation of a cube saying it's<br>pointing that way is actually the same<br>as it pointing that way or that way or<br>reflecting it or 48 different<br>orientations are equivalent if you allow<br>for<br>reflections and and the simple methods<br>of statistics just don't cope<br>you have to do something better and<br>that's what my work in directional<br>statistics has been about with one<br>the motivating example was this one it<br>turns out earthquakes<br>are very highly directional so an<br>earthquake<br>as many in this room will know is when<br>we have a fault that ruptures it slips<br>so we have a planar weakness<br>and a block moves in one particular<br>direction<br>so the block seems to be moving upwards<br>but it's just as well to say the other<br>block was moving downwards so we have an<br>ambiguity<br>the patch of earth patch of rock that's<br>splitting which has been glued together<br>by molecular bonds it's just<br>tiny micro level effect chemical effect<br>they break and it ruptures maybe no<br>bigger than the front of this lecture<br>theater<br>and you can get an enormous effect<br>earthquakes of course are driven<br>so so this is a case where directional<br>statistics actually<br>are highly relevant because you can't do<br>the analysis without taking into account<br>um and that that led to some work with<br>john towne and on<br>and others on mapping the stress<br>tectonic stress so this is the crushing<br>stress um caused by the grinding of the<br>technology plates<br>that causes the earthquakes in new<br>zealand this is a tactile<br>stress map of new zealand more data in<br>the north island more earthquakes there<br>more going on<br>big ones still in the south uh so this<br>worked with john town and<br>but led to work different work with<br>martha<br>um so i've also posted a picture there<br>so<br>distractibility this wasn't the only<br>thing i ended up doing<br>i've i've had a very fruitful<br>collaboration with these two women with<br>ayakawa and stefan kacova<br>on reliability theory at lower<br>right you can see a schematic of a<br>complex system<br>like an aircraft or a computer or<br>a car engine where components<br>represented by the circles<br>are failing and damaging each other as<br>as they age<br>and so we we developed models for for<br>this kind of change over time<br>so this is an application of<br>of um survival analysis<br>but in a complex system where we have<br>multiple shocking happening between<br>different members and parts of a system<br>clustering is a<br>quite a group of us in in a school<br>working on<br>clustering finding things which are<br>similar to each other from data<br>unsupervised clustering so at top right<br>there these these colored dots are<br>clusters of trolls where the<br>composition of the trawl um was similar<br>so the same mix of different types of<br>fish and the interest here is to know<br>which kinds of<br>environmental conditions these clusters<br>like and as the environmental conditions<br>change which ones of them are going to<br>migrate southwards to find warmer waters<br>and retreat from the the um the much<br>warmer waters<br>to the north as will happen over time<br>there's a picture of miriam ihof there<br>because<br>the directly above her is an analysis of<br>structures<br>in in different englishes and and in a<br>particular<br>variety of english from the caribbean<br>looking at grammatical structures same<br>mathematical models<br>very different application lots of fun<br>so miriam may not remember saying this<br>but this is the<br>you do remember it this is this is<br>this is the way i came to know miriam<br>because miriam came was introduced to me<br>by dallas<br>sim our uh then um universal university<br>statistical consultant<br>and her take was i'm bored with the way<br>that linguistics is being done in my<br>my field i would like to see different<br>methods<br>i'd like to see different um and<br>exciting ways of treating the data that<br>yield more insight and that is a<br>motivating question when someone comes<br>in to say i want to do something<br>different<br>um that's the shiny object that i'm i'm<br>often chasing<br>so here are other things that have<br>distracted me in recent times so we<br>we've there's more on on on linguistics<br>at top right so these are those uh<br>speakers in south auckland with<br>different um<br>different making different vowel sounds<br>um bottom left<br>there is covid modeling um which is<br>happening now i'm very<br>pleased to be contributing to two<br>strands of<br>modelling of covert rest risk<br>narcotics anonymous is a an organization<br>i've contributed to in the surveys of<br>themselves<br>and i'd just like to say what a<br>fantastic thing it is to work for an<br>organization<br>that is so optimistic about the future<br>it's the belief<br>that everybody can can be well is um<br>is reason enough to be involved um and<br>other other organizations as well<br>rainbow wellington i was chair<br>um forecasting lightning strikes is<br>something that's likely to happen<br>sometime soon and and we may be starting<br>up with a met service<br>i don't know who said this to me but i<br>guess we're all saying it to each other<br>and this<br>this is this is the motivating<br>um question so<br>how on earth has the world got to the<br>point where<br>someone would even think of writing a<br>billboard of that sort<br>and carrying around and feeling that<br>that was telling someone something that<br>they didn't already know<br>and it's quite it is quite an<br>extraordinary thing to reflect on<br>um so we<br>live in a strange world with strange<br>beliefs taking place<br>um all the time we've seen<br>um a number of<br>very bizarre beliefs which are motivated<br>or driven<br>by ideas which which seem completely<br>illogical but of course of the person<br>and all this in a place when we're<br>shouting at each other<br>that are completely unproductive and i<br>assert that there is too much bad<br>faith reading of other people's work<br>there's far too much<br>taking someone's statement and taking to<br>the extreme<br>and finding the the worst possible<br>interpretation of what someone has said<br>or the word that they've used and not<br>um<br>we have we have we have to deal with<br>this in a climate when<br>our leaders or many of them are setting<br>and and they're bad actors as well<br>trying to to<br>change our minds about elections and<br>trying deliberately trying to distort<br>our viewers views of the world um<br>and so for the statistician for the<br>applied scientists<br>it is distressing that the reason logic<br>and evidence don't seem to matter<br>and that was that that<br>the provision of a well-reasoned<br>argument supported by evidence<br>seems not to be enough um<br>and so oh no sorry<br>so this was my first first real taste of<br>that um<br>i was involved with the an evaluation of<br>the effectiveness of the meningococcal b<br>vaccine<br>and this was the picture was taken by of<br>me by a journalist and that was<br>the um caption so i was at the ministry<br>of health<br>sat next to some people i have hey yeah<br>almost everybody i picked out is not<br>here so maybe<br>oh they are yes very good thank you for<br>coming<br>so this is another terrifying moment i'm<br>mostly much younger<br>there um<br>so there were there were people very<br>hostile to this program hostile to the<br>idea of vaccinations and mass<br>vaccination<br>and um that was quite something to be<br>emailed by anti-vaxxers<br>and have them demanding the contents of<br>my hard drive<br>um therefore um<br>work with te puna matatini um<br>rebecca priestley and i have uh a funded<br>project which i'm very pleased to start<br>that will start next<br>next year on the public mistrust of<br>science and fake news specifically in<br>new zealand we're interested in<br>um what goes on in new zealand and new<br>zealanders heads and and how this has<br>all got so bad<br>and we are hiring anyone so an msc party<br>scholarship is available<br>that's it um i'd like to thank now again<br>if just a few people i like thanks my<br>parents<br>obviously my husband's my sister to my<br>sister my two brothers are not here but<br>my two sisters are i can see one and i<br>can't see the other<br>oh there we go nieces and nephews um<br>um my friends like to sanctify chance of<br>the provost<br>and in advance dave harper who is under<br>no pressure<br>now as he delivers a bunch of thanks um<br>my colleagues<br>um in vic<br>my um the colleagues in the<br>school office and the faculty office<br>especially you do<br>such wonderful things a special shout<br>dawn and nicholas start my day every day<br>with a latte and<br>like a clearing of my email i'd like to<br>also<br>thank my collaborators here and<br>elsewhere my students<br>are being inspirational keeping me<br>working<br>i like to think of the table and that's<br>a group of people that i was introduced<br>to<br>very early on hey megan warren<br>um laurie i'm gonna go i'm gonna forget<br>some people don't have<br>uh there are a whole lot of people that<br>from across the university that gave me<br>a very rich introduction to university<br>life<br>i'm extremely grateful to them different<br>strokes wellington<br>the uh wellington's lgbt swimming<br>club we have members here i'm very<br>grateful for you<br>for being here so thank you thank you<br>for coming taking this time out to<br>listen to me<br>so<br>right the last part i've just asked<br>richard to stand up the front and look<br>awkward for the last 10 minutes<br>we are right on time so he's going to<br>get 10 minutes with us vice chancellor<br>professor arnold julian<br>richards parents friends guests<br>all welcome now my my name is dave<br>harper i'm the deputy<br>pvc for science<br>health engineering architecture and<br>design innovation<br>and i think richard has the rare<br>distinction of being having been in<br>two of those faculties in the last two<br>weeks<br>you're part of the university you<br>understand um<br>it's my honor and it really is to<br>deliver the vote of thanks<br>for tonight's lecture so let's just do<br>that cure richard thank you<br>we could end there and some of you may<br>want me to richard probably does<br>but really to do richard and his talk as<br>service tonight requires a little bit<br>more<br>so first some context to be appointed as<br>professor requires somebody to be<br>excellent in many different ways<br>research yes but also a leader of<br>international standing<br>commitment to excellence in education<br>respect from peers and demonstrated<br>leadership<br>in the broader aspects of the university<br>and a contribution to society<br>it's not just about research so<br>richard's appointment to professor of<br>statistics and data science in 2019<br>represents not only a personal<br>achievement for him but also an<br>indicator of his leadership<br>in one of the most rapidly evolving<br>domains of knowledge<br>some of which he's touched on tonight<br>now professor guilford said something i<br>noted quite alarming in his introduction<br>and i'm going to quote they've got to<br>laugh richard will explain how<br>statisticians think about the world and<br>why their thinking seems to be so<br>different from everyone else<br>now having sat through many inaugural<br>lectures such a comment would normally<br>lead us to all to have pretty<br>underwhelming expectations of what<br>followed however that would have been a<br>mistake and i think<br>the applause when richard came in<br>signals the respect and the knowledge<br>that people have about what an<br>excellent speaker is i saw that<br>a number of years ago so long ago i<br>can't actually remember i'm not sure<br>richard remembers<br>i was hosting some regional outreach<br>event in new plymouth i think<br>and we'd lined up several lecturers to<br>give the 10 minute inspirational<br>speech i didn't choose richard<br>um he was recommended to me on the<br>advice of others who had seen him speak<br>in introductory statistics lectures or<br>some such<br>now he was up against people talking<br>about climate change cures for cancer<br>antarctica<br>you name it and the title well i don't<br>remember the title of his talk<br>but the topic of his talk was something<br>to do with the application of bayes<br>theorem to the exchange paradox<br>again if you didn't know what he was<br>going to do you would have been pretty<br>underwhelmed<br>but and i'm not lying he he was the most<br>engaging talk of the evening apologies<br>if anybody else gave talks that night<br>and received the most positive feedback<br>and you've seen why tonight<br>it just shows that richard illustrates<br>you can't just judge a book by its cover<br>i mean in a positive way<br>um if you can<br>fake it that way i've known richard 20<br>years he's used to me<br>um now perhaps it's a reputation as an<br>excellent communicator or perhaps it's<br>simply a sign of how many people like<br>richard<br>but we started not just off with an<br>applause tonight um but we started off<br>in a much much smaller room<br>now who would have thought again let's<br>just give some context<br>a title a lecture titled a distractible<br>astronomer learns about some statistics<br>on a mid-winter midweek cold<br>windy wellington evening we would have<br>more people than there are seats in here<br>so it's evidence richard of<br>what people think of you in a positive<br>way we're not that desperate after<br>covert and so forth<br>they've come to see you but instead of<br>being rude about richard although i will<br>return to that i should<br>turn to honoring his impact um<br>and leadership in the research domain<br>it's supposed to be slightly serious i<br>counted well over a hundred publications<br>in a cv covering a vast array of topics<br>he's touched on that<br>thankfully i'll name some of them a<br>prospective study of the effectiveness<br>of<br>uh new zealand mendricot meningococcal b<br>vaccine<br>slightly more dodgy title estimating the<br>prevalence of schizophrenia amongst<br>new zealand maori a capture recapture<br>approach<br>only statisticians would use that in the<br>title<br>and one that i now understand<br>given how you started your talk the<br>title being<br>is testicular cancer and occupational<br>disease of firefighters<br>the connection to urology i'm guessing<br>um<br>and we heard tonight about many other<br>collaborations and problems he's worked<br>on<br>the positive impact of his research is<br>is is<br>shown in many ways not just the<br>publications um he hasn't even mentioned<br>the literal millions of dollars him and<br>his collaborators<br>have attracted for really good research<br>and he was recognized by his peers<br>when he was awarded the 2019 statistical<br>association<br>little john research award now the best<br>science stems no pun intended from<br>clever insight curiosity<br>a focus on problem solving and bringing<br>together different perspectives richard<br>achieves this and you saw that again<br>tonight<br>his analytical expertise is crucial in<br>enabling science<br>to be accurate and honest and i think<br>that's a there was a<br>message in one sense that richard was<br>conveying towards the<br>end there we're filled with information<br>around us all the time<br>and the information that we produce<br>whatever the research domain is<br>heavily reliant on being good and having<br>authenticity<br>and the sort of skills that richard has<br>brings that to it<br>so thank you richard for being a<br>champion of scientific success there was<br>some thank yous in this by the way it<br>was a<br>thank you speech helping us make sense<br>of the world around us<br>indeed it might be rich's ability to<br>communicate that highlights yet another<br>strength<br>he's an amazing teacher and educator so<br>he's great at research he's also a great<br>teacher<br>at this point for those of you who've<br>enjoyed my 10 minute speech before<br>i would normally read out a few quotes<br>from students however recognising<br>richard's area of expertise i thought<br>he'd appreciate something slightly more<br>quantitative<br>now those of you in the room who who are<br>affiliated with the university will know<br>that we asked<br>people's students to rate their lectures<br>on a whole lot of different questions on<br>a<br>one to five scale one is outstanding by<br>the way that's the good score<br>and i can state with confidence although<br>i'm not sure i'm actually supposed to<br>buy hr but i'm going to<br>that an analysis that i performed over<br>the last five years<br>student evaluations showed that<br>richard's overall effectiveness score<br>the big one<br>is 1.1 with a modal score of one put in<br>perspective<br>most students think richard is<br>outstanding<br>okay<br>and i'm not making up data either<br>just in case you're worried but there's<br>another one that i actually think is<br>more important his attitude<br>towards students that's that question<br>rating is one<br>that means every single student<br>effectively rated him as outstanding in<br>his attitude towards them<br>i think that's amazing and i've seen<br>some amazing in a different way<br>evaluations of this now being a<br>professor is not just about being<br>internationally recognized research it's<br>not just about being a great teacher<br>it's also about inspiring others via all<br>sorts of means your communication<br>generally<br>now a number of years ago i had the<br>privilege of hearing the late sir paul<br>callahan<br>speaking actually to a crop of new<br>professors and<br>in this very building as it happens and<br>he noted that the latin origin of the<br>title professor came from<br>profess so in other words to declare<br>publicly<br>now richard is truly somebody who's<br>willing to go the extra mile to publicly<br>share or profess his knowledge and views<br>that's what makes him not just a great<br>statistician an educator<br>but also ensures that he has positive<br>impact<br>so thinking of public declarations or<br>professorials or something<br>richard has shown himself to be quite<br>willing to profess in many different<br>ways<br>i will now go on to the third component<br>of being a professor<br>now there are some professors and due<br>respect to some in the room<br>um who you never see them leave their<br>offices you just have to go and check on<br>them occasionally to make sure they're<br>still with us<br>there are other professors you never<br>want to hear from again<br>but richard he's something else he's a<br>professor who contributes to the life of<br>the university<br>he engages intellectual debate and<br>curiosity<br>i can say fully i've checked this as<br>well um<br>100 100 attendance at academic board<br>his fingerprints i wish we were actually<br>in the council chambers are literally<br>engraved on the microphone for questions<br>in the um in the council boardroom where<br>we hold academic<br>board meetings outside of the university<br>he's also<br>contributed to the community via<br>interviews you've heard the commentary<br>on elections<br>he's tweeted about past employers don't<br>worry vice chancellor not the university<br>don't worry wasn't the ministry of<br>health um i'll stop the guessing game<br>and has been chair as you heard of<br>rainbow wellington<br>his impact on the community has been<br>quite impressive as as much as<br>impressive i think it was his academic<br>success<br>it didn't take me much research and i'm<br>really pleased that he had<br>quotes i didn't see richard's speech<br>before he gave it because now it's going<br>to be<br>turned on him i found a quote from<br>richard<br>2017 september issue of stuff<br>he was asked on his views on<br>maybe you should take your hat off i'm<br>not sure when richard was lasted or he<br>addressed but anyway<br>he is quoted as saying and we'll take it<br>therefore as fact the only thing that's<br>relevant is what<br>is on your head and what they do to it<br>it doesn't matter what's happening<br>that is a quote from richard so in the<br>physical<br>we're getting there and so in the<br>physical realm richard is a little bit<br>of a statistical paradox himself he's<br>spoken about paradoxes<br>on the one hand he admits he that<br>domestic tasks like hitting a nail with<br>a hammer or gardening and beyond him or<br>at least he says to julian<br>but although he admits that backstroke<br>remains a mystery<br>he has been successful in terms of<br>serving as the captain of different<br>strokes wellington<br>so he's a bit of an enigma or a paradox<br>himself<br>but more noteworthy are his physical<br>achievements in the dancing domain now<br>not many people maybe in the room know<br>this i'll give you two examples<br>he was a part-time salsa instructor in<br>the netherlands during his post-op to<br>make ends meet<br>maybe he will show us how but one that<br>we're<br>more intrigued by is that he was invited<br>to dance in a conga line behind stephen<br>it's it's a whole different talk i think<br>okay on a personal note um moving<br>towards the end now i've known richard<br>as i say for<br>maybe close on 20 years it's hard to<br>know what point we<br>came across each other in the university<br>um i respect him hugely<br>i think the attendance tonight shows how<br>much people not just in the university<br>but broadly<br>respect him as well we all know that<br>he's a lovely person<br>he's a great colleague he cares about<br>the people about him he cares about his<br>students<br>he cares about his colleagues and the<br>community and he cares about this<br>institution we call victoria university<br>of wellington<br>so we're really very fortunate to have a<br>member of the community and as a<br>professor<br>at this university so finally the thank<br>you on behalf of the<br>academic community on behalf of your<br>actual family<br>on behalf of everyone here i thank you<br>for your talk<br>and i wish you every success in your<br>if you keep it going it just feels more<br>awkward it's quite good<br>um so we're finished with the formal<br>part of this evening because of time<br>constraints and i've gone on way too<br>long we don't have time for questions<br>but we do have and i'm looking at leah<br>over there um<br>refreshments richard will be really<br>happy to entertain people with answering<br>questions and<br>showing his prowess with salsa or<br>whatever it is maybe we'll do a conga<br>line<br>um and leah you somebody's yes<br>in the common room uh follow the doors<br>and you will find it<br>um anyway um travel safely tonight thank<br>you again</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
