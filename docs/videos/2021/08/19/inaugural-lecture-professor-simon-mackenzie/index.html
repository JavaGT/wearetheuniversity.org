the<br>wellington faculty of humanities and<br>social sciences<br>my name is professor grant guilford i'm<br>vice chancellor of taharingawaka<br>victoria university of wellington<br>new zealand's globally ranked capital<br>city university and new zealand's top<br>ranked university for the intensity of<br>high quality research<br>it's my very great pleasure to host you<br>all here today<br>i'd like to briefly introduce professor<br>mckenzie before handing over to him to<br>deliver his lecture<br>simon received his bachelor of laws with<br>first class honours and diploma in legal<br>practice from the university of<br>edinburgh after which he worked as a<br>litigation lawyer for several years<br>before coming back to academia<br>completing his master's in<br>criminological research at the<br>university of cambridge<br>he then made his way over to the side of<br>the world completing his phd in<br>criminology at the university of<br>melbourne<br>he first became professor of criminology<br>law and society at the university of<br>glasgow in 2012<br>an exceptional achievement only eight<br>years after finishing his phd and the<br>recognition of how quickly he<br>established his status as an<br>internationally recognised scholar<br>in that same year he traveled to<br>taharangawaka for his first for the<br>first time<br>as a visiting scholar and in 2016 he<br>returned to our university becoming<br>professor of criminology in the school<br>of social and cultural studies<br>professor mckenzie has written edited<br>and contributed to a very significant<br>number of books and journal articles<br>his early book based on his phd research<br>going gone regulating the market in<br>illicit antiquities won the british<br>society of criminology book prize for<br>the best first book in 2005<br>and since then he has gone on to win<br>several other awards for his work<br>simon studies white collar crime and<br>organized crime in his and his most<br>recent book transnational criminology<br>published last year<br>poured together these fields through his<br>work on the underworld of the global<br>economy researching a variety of forms<br>of international

journal of crime and justice and<br>the australian and new zealand journal<br>of criminology<br>professor mckenzie has attracted strong<br>research funding throughout his career<br>from a variety of sources including<br>prestigious national research councils<br>government agencies the eu and the<br>united nations<br>this current project is funded by the<br>european research council and it<br>includes the research you will hear<br>about this evening<br>here at taharia professor mckenzie's<br>wide ranging knowledge and skills have<br>been a tremendous asset to the school of<br>social and cultural studies he was the<br>director of the institute of criminology<br>from 2017 to 2019<br>and was made head of the school in<br>2020 he is a passionate lecturer and<br>postgraduate supervisor and is known for<br>his dedication to guiding the next<br>generation of criminology scholars<br>in this lecture professor mckenzie will<br>explore cryptocurrency scams and<br>criminology<br>a sprawling and eclectic alternative<br>financial system has developed in recent<br>years<br>selling cutting edge techno investment<br>schemes that are complex and high risk<br>crime control is almost entirely absent<br>from this new crypto economy and it is<br>full of scams<br>professor mckenzie will discuss some of<br>the scams currently taking place in<br>cryptocurrency markets and show that the<br>classic old social routines of criminal<br>deception are flourishing in the new<br>online economy<br>please join me in welcoming professor<br>mckenzie<br>everybody for coming along<br>to listen to<br>a story about uh<br>and crime<br>um<br>it's an inaugural i've got some<br>inaugurally type<br>thank yous to say but i'm going to leave<br>them to the end because i don't want the<br>beginning to be boring<br>but i'm going to break that rule at the<br>beginning to say welcome family<br>it's not every day you get to lecture in<br>front of your phone not even not every<br>day it's never<br>never before never again<br>probably<br>so welcome to them the kids are looking<br>forward to finding out how lambos get on<br>the moon<br>so<br>let's get right into it<br>this is from uh<br>the uk daily mail<br>in the year 2000<br>to just 20 years ago<br>and um<br>the daily mail was my<br>parents<br>drug of choice i think we would say<br>mind-altering substance perhaps of<br>choice<br>when i was growing up so i joined the<br>ranks quite early of people who<br>doubted everything they read<br>it was quite good<br>academic training<br>and<br>it turns out the internet wasn't a<br>passing fad<br>it's become quite a big deal actually<br>and one of the things that it's done is<br>it has introduced<br>amongst many other things<br>a market a financial market<br>online in<br>um<br>cryptocurrency we'll call it crypto for<br>sure from now on<br>so this is where two of my research<br>interests come together white-collar<br>climate organized crime as grant said<br>particularly in relation to markets and<br>in this lecture we'll look at financial<br>markets one particular emerging<br>financial market and crypto<br>and<br>also the reason why i've chosen this as<br>an inaugural lecture is because it fits<br>with one of my methodological interests<br>as well my prime methodological interest<br>which is ethnography<br>so criminologists use lots of different<br>techniques in order to interrogate crime<br>there's statistics there's experiments<br>sometimes<br>interviews lots of interviews<br>ethnography is about getting<br>involved in the scenes where the crime<br>happens trying to get as close to the<br>crime as possible understanding it in<br>its own terms<br>learning by doing not obviously doing<br>the crime but doing in the sense of<br>being a part of the scene where the<br>crime is happening and so you learn<br>the emotions at play and the feelings<br>and the<br>and what's relevant to the people who<br>are in and around the space<br>so that's what we're going to do tonight<br>we're going to talk about ethnographic<br>research on crime in relation to one<br>particular<br>subculture within the economy which is<br>cryptocurrency trading we're going to<br>look at the life<br>of<br>the crypto trader<br>and what we'll find is that we've got<br>bleeding edge technology here<br>and an emerging financial marketplace<br>but<br>um<br>the crime emerging with it is really not<br>particularly new scams are very old<br>social routines drawing on classic<br>themes of confidence and deception and<br>so what first appears perhaps to be a<br>super advanced cyber crime actually<br>turns out to be best understood as just<br>the latest installment in a long social<br>story<br>the protagonist of which is the con<br>artist<br>so i'm going to talk about three things<br>today cryptocurrency scams and memes<br>and memes are these internet jokes these<br>little pictures<br>and they're mostly the same the picture<br>doesn't change but the caching changes<br>uh they are endlessly repeated in<br>cryptocurrency forums they're traded<br>like almost like currency themselves<br>and the reason i'm including these is<br>is twofold really firstly because i want<br>to do that ethnographic thing of giving<br>you a feel for<br>what it's like to be in the<br>cryptocurrency trading space and memes<br>is a is about the best way i can think<br>of to do that<br>um and secondly a more sort of<br>intellectual reason they helped me to<br>make a point which is really one of the<br>underlying themes of the whole lecture<br>which is about classic structure and<br>endless variety<br>and i'm going to suggest to you that<br>cryptocurrency and also scams have the<br>same thing that memes have which is a<br>classic basic structure to them several<br>sort of core themes<br>an endless variety in which they<br>manifest themselves<br>in the world<br>the guy the old guy is called uh hide<br>the pain harold and his story is that he<br>was one of these stock catalogue<br>photograph models and and<br>he was told just to do a sort of smile<br>that would use it go for anything use it<br>for any catalogue and he signed off on<br>that thing saying you will use it for<br>whatever you like<br>um and the internet didn't take long to<br>determine that he seemed to be hiding<br>some sort of deep inner anguish<br>with that smile<br>and<br>uh and so he became hide the pain harold<br>he was quite upset about it for a bit<br>and uh and now he's got into it he's<br>sort of going on the joke so he thinks<br>so um<br>we'll come to see that the that theme<br>represents cryptocurrency scams<br>and therefore scams can be scammed in<br>crypto in particular it can be thought<br>of as a kind of meme crime a basic<br>architecture of social deception played<br>out over and over again in glorious<br>variety thousands of minor tweaks on a<br>few major underlying criminal routines<br>but let's not get ahead of ourselves<br>let's start at the beginning<br>of my beginning in relation to all of<br>this anyway a picture of the scene it<br>was<br>january 2018 and sally had gone away for<br>three nights i think it was to australia<br>and she'd taken the oldest with her and<br>left me with the two wee ones who were<br>about one and three at the time so i was<br>putting them to bed at<br>about 7 30 or so like a responsible<br>parent and then i had the rest of the<br>evening to myself<br>and the devil makes work for idle hands<br>and so on the first night i was reading<br>the newspaper and i came across a story<br>about a cryptocurrency called ripple<br>and the reporter was saying that ripple<br>was the new bitcoin<br>and i didn't really know much about the<br>old bitcoin at that point i i knew a<br>couple of things probably the same sort<br>of things that everybody knows<br>um<br>i knew that it had gone up a lot in<br>value and i'd missed out on it<br>like everybody has uh here it is going<br>up to<br>60 60 000 per bitcoin recently<br>and the second thing i knew relatedly<br>was the story uh by the bitcoin pizzas<br>uh in 2010 this 22nd of may 2010 a<br>software developer called laszlo<br>went to papa john's and placed a 30<br>pizza order and paid in bitcoin and<br>bitcoin at the time was uh about a third<br>of a cent and so he paid 10 000 bitcoin<br>and on the 22nd of may every year after<br>that the crypto community comes together<br>to have a bit of a laugh about how much<br>those pieces would have cost in today's<br>bitcoin money<br>and this year going past it was about<br>400 million dollars<br>so those are expensive pieces<br>so i was reading about ripple in january<br>2018 and<br>to say the least i was intrigued<br>um i thought i'll just look into it just<br>that way you do i'll just find out a bit<br>more about it<br>and so i spent the next few nights<br>finding out more about it it was kind of<br>pretty complex at the time it was quite<br>hard actually to work out what it was uh<br>how to get it<br>and to cut a long story you can see how<br>the story is going to end can you<br>because it's not going to be i didn't<br>buy any<br>from the end of the lecture um i bought<br>some and i got to that point where i<br>thought i'd just put so much time into<br>this now i might as well get some<br>um<br>and so i did<br>uh<br>i bought some ripple you can imagine the<br>conversation i had to sally when she<br>came back from<br>from australia<br>you'd be like what you you sent some at<br>the time you couldn't getting the fiat<br>money getting your your money into<br>crypto was actually quite a difficult<br>thing to do you had there was a sort of<br>nefarious that wasn't nefarious until i<br>said but it seemed quite under under<br>under the radar peer-to-peer sharing<br>network you had to send your money off<br>to someone and they would send you<br>bitcoin back so i sent my money off<br>through this network to some dude in<br>hong kong<br>and um sally was like what you've sent<br>that money off to hong kong<br>and<br>so<br>i i said there'll be a lot about memes<br>there'll be a lot about memes um one of<br>the memes that you've probably come<br>across if you exist on the internet is<br>how it started how it's going<br>here's a<br>here's how it started<br>this is ripple<br>ripple went up<br>um<br>from about half a cent<br>in the 2017s<br>to uh over three dollars it went up over<br>600 times so if you'd put a thousand<br>dollars in when it was half a cent you'd<br>have 600 grand a couple of years later i<br>at 3.10<br>and i was looking at this and thinking<br>this is the investment i've been looking<br>for in my entire life it just goes up<br>i'm gonna start i could go on about it<br>but i've done some visuals for you to<br>help you to understand what was going on<br>so<br>i said we're going to say we're going to<br>look back on this this is going to be an<br>auspicious day the day that i pressed<br>that send button and<br>bought that ripple<br>so that's how it started this is how<br>it's going i do look back on it<br>there's actually a lot of memes for that<br>because as it shakes out i bought not<br>only at the top of ripple i bought the<br>top of everything<br>the entire crypto market collapsed in uh<br>early mid 2018<br>descended into this<br>mire<br>and<br>so there's like the paint world again<br>smiling through the trouble<br>um<br>yeah<br>everything just fell apart<br>the previous chart that i showed you<br>about bitcoin was the logarithmic scale<br>i'll show you again oops there it is<br>which is the um<br>it goes up by a factor of 10 and it kind<br>of masks the massive volatility involved<br>it makes it look like bitcoin's just<br>grinding up over the years which overall<br>it kind of has been the reality the<br>proper skill you want to look at is the<br>linear scale which is like that<br>you get these enormous parabolic bull<br>runs and crashes<br>interspersed with huge periods of<br>massive stagnation where basically<br>nothing much happens and people give up<br>and projects die they call it crypto<br>winter<br>so i entered crypto winter after 2018<br>um<br>in a state of reasonable disgust about<br>my participation in the whole thing i<br>and i deleted the app from my phone and<br>didn't really check it and every now and<br>again sally would say how's the crypto<br>going<br>oh yeah it's going well yeah<br>are we bitcoin millionaires yet<br>no no not yet<br>not yet give it time<br>um<br>and then as you can see from the chart<br>it all came roaring back in late 2020 um<br>and we're all back in the game i say<br>we're all back in the game i'm not back<br>in the game as much as i should be<br>because um out of all of the top crypto<br>currencies<br>one of them got sued by the securities<br>and exchange commission in the united<br>states which has massively suppressed<br>the price it's something like an ongoing<br>joint ice jaundice situation where it's<br>just sort of never-ending litigation<br>and that cryptocurrency was rebel so<br>lucky old me so i didn't quite make it<br>back to the top but um but lots of other<br>people did and the reason it went up as<br>much as it did was the d5 summer of<br>2020.<br>what on earth was that<br>well<br>i'll explain it<br>in my 2018 foray into the market um<br>when you wanted to buy cryptocurrency<br>you had to do on a centralized exchange<br>this is a centralized exchange<br>centralized exchange is owned by<br>somebody or some company<br>and it matches up buyers and sellers it<br>looks quite complicated it kind of is i<br>suppose but the reality of what it's<br>doing is that it's a bit like a foreign<br>currency exchange or a stock market<br>exchange the green people want to buy<br>the red people want to sell you tell it<br>if you want to buy something or sell<br>something at a certain price it'll wait<br>until somebody wants to do the other<br>side of that trade and it'll pair you up<br>together<br>job done um<br>in the d5 summer d5 for decentralized<br>finance as opposed to centralized<br>finance<br>and the decentralized finance summer of<br>2020 uh decentralized exchanges came<br>onto the scene dexes<br>and a dex unlike a centralized exchange<br>is pretty much fully automated nobody<br>really runs it somebody sets it up and<br>it goes on automated algorithms and<br>smart contracts it basically runs itself<br>it's decentralized nobody's in charge<br>here's an example of a decentralized<br>exchange it looks much<br>more basic this is one called uniswap<br>which is a pretty basic sort of token<br>swap interface with a nice picture of a<br>unicorn<br>and<br>these taxes don't match up buyers and<br>sellers in the way that centralized<br>exchanges do in order to make swaps they<br>need a thing called a pool of liquidity<br>in other words they hold the tokens and<br>if you want to buy the tokens from them<br>you're buying from the decks directly<br>rather than pairing up with any other<br>person behind the scenes<br>so<br>where's the liquidity pool come from and<br>the dex where where do the tokens come<br>from that it uses<br>well two places firstly a person who<br>launches a cryptocurrency will<br>put the tokens into the decks to allow<br>it to trade with them<br>and secondly it comes from us the<br>traders we can loan our tokens into the<br>decks<br>why do we do that well every time<br>there's a swap happening somebody trades<br>we get there's a little fee that's<br>levied a transaction fee and we get a<br>little cut of it so you're a liquidity<br>provider you give your tokens you lend<br>your tokens to the decks to allow it to<br>have that liquidity pool that it can use<br>so<br>since one of the main tenets of<br>decentralization is um open source<br>coding<br>immediately upon anything being launched<br>it's forked or copied<br>and this happened with unit swap it was<br>copied by sushi swap and taco swap and<br>burger swap<br>and<br>pink the really popular one pancakes on<br>why are they all to do with food i don't<br>know<br>um i think it starts off somebody does a<br>food thing just at random and then<br>everybody else following that seems to<br>go<br>the food thing's working let's let's<br>just go with the food<br>pancake swap is a good example of of the<br>the incredible vortex that's happened<br>around d5 and what has happened the<br>whirlwind opportunities for an<br>investment i'll tell you kind of roughly<br>how it works so<br>pancake swap there's a swap interface<br>like there was with uni swap you'd be a<br>liquidity provider you can loan your<br>tokens into pancake swap and it will<br>give you in return<br>a thing called an lp token which is like<br>a marker for the tokens that you have<br>lended into the platform you've got your<br>lp token or tokens you can then do a<br>thing with that called yield farming<br>where you put it into the yield farm on<br>pancake swap and you get interest a rate<br>of return which is paid in cake<br>which is the native token of of pancake<br>swap<br>if you're starting to think this is all<br>sounding a little bit wild and crazy<br>let's add another layer to it one of the<br>other things that you can do and defy<br>is if you happen to have a pet rock<br>or a crypto punk<br>crypto punks were given away for free in<br>2017 you could have downloaded one for<br>nothing it would now be worth<br>millions of dollars<br>uh so it's not unthinkable that you<br>might have one i don't um or pet rock<br>even which is worth a hundred thousand<br>uh still a bit mad still uh i don't have<br>any um but if you did happen to have one<br>of these things you could go to uh<br>another bit of d5 which is a<br>collateralized lending platform<br>and you could put up your<br>um<br>rock actually it's a basically what it<br>is an nft it's a there's a whole other<br>talk about nfts but it's a picture of a<br>rock essentially a jpeg of a rock so you<br>lodge a jpeg of a rock with<br>the lending platform and it will lend<br>you money based on the perceived value<br>of that jpeg of the rock which is<br>further for that particular rock a<br>hundred thousand<br>if it's a responsible landing platform<br>it will give you maybe 25<br>there are also irresponsible landing<br>platforms and defy because nobody really<br>controls the space they don't give you<br>an under collateralized loan they'll<br>lend you more than the value of your<br>rock<br>which i think we can all agree is<br>already quite overheated in terms of of<br>its valuation so you might get anywhere<br>from twenty five thousand dollars to<br>150 000<br>uh and you've lodged your rook with this<br>lending platform you take that money you<br>put it in pancake swap pancake swap<br>gives you an lp token you put lp token<br>back into the yield farm and pretty soon<br>you've turned a rock into cake and<br>you're loving it it's great and you've<br>forgotten<br>where<br>the rock was and where the money came<br>from and you've got to pay back that<br>loan at some point in the future but you<br>don't care because it's all good because<br>you're rolling in cake<br>and it sounds ridiculous but cake's<br>worth a lot of money now<br>and pancake is worth a lot of money now<br>the total value locked in pancake swap<br>in other words the value of all of the<br>crypto tokens that people have invested<br>in the platform through all these<br>various mechanisms is nine billion<br>dollars<br>now by comparison<br>anz is new zealand's biggest kiwisaver<br>scheme they've got lots of little<br>kiwisaver versions under the whole anz<br>brand but if you take every kiwisaver<br>thing that anz does the total value<br>locked in that is 11 billion us dollars<br>so anz kiwisaver 11 billion pancake nine<br>billion almost as much<br>kiwisaver's been going since<br>2007<br>i think 14 years or so pancakes been<br>going since late last year and it only<br>actually got popular earlier this year<br>it's going ballistic<br>now the next question i guess is um<br>what kind of uber sophisticated and<br>farsighted investor<br>is doing this arbitraging of rocks and<br>cakes and uh and all this sort of stuff<br>uh surely there's some sort of entry<br>requirements for for this and the<br>frightening answer is because it's<br>decentralized there isn't anybody can do<br>it<br>in principle defy is about removing the<br>institutional barriers to access to<br>finance so you can do all of this<br>without a credit check without<br>any sort of bank as an intermediary<br>without character references<br>and the risks are huge<br>obviously<br>and in d5 the risks are all yours<br>because in a decentralized economy<br>you're completely in charge of your<br>money and your trades there's nobody<br>looking out for you there's no customer<br>service desk that you can phone up if<br>something goes wrong<br>you're under 16 welcoming you are<br>using money that you can't afford to<br>lose well that's not such a great idea<br>but it's going to be treated exactly the<br>same as anybody else's money it's<br>basically an active trading market where<br>anyone can enter and the requirements<br>seem to be hey you've got a computer b<br>your risk<br>assessment threshold is somewhere<br>way out in the left field<br>if you<br>send the money to the wrong address<br>is gone you're not getting that back<br>if you um<br>surrender possession of your tokens to<br>the decks in the way that you're doing<br>when you're doing all of this you're<br>giving your lending your tokens to the<br>decks<br>if that dex gets hacked if it implodes<br>for some reason it liquidates it goes<br>bankrupt anything happens<br>game over<br>um<br>back on the centralized exchanges if you<br>remember those<br>you used to have to if you wanted to<br>list a token you used to have to go<br>through sort of vetting pro it wasn't a<br>severe vetting process but there was a<br>process for getting listed you had to<br>get some sort of approval to get listed<br>on a dex because nobody's in charge<br>anybody can make a token and anybody can<br>list it and so if people are listing<br>hundreds of tokens a day and a massive<br>proportion of those are at the moment<br>scams and there's really no restriction<br>everyone's looking for moonshots<br>there's big established projects they're<br>they're referred to um in a sort of<br>absurdist stock market jargon uh<br>uh thing as blue chips<br>like bitcoin and ethereum and they're<br>going to go up in value you would think<br>but they're not really going to go up in<br>as quickly<br>as you need in order to get<br>your gazillions what's going to happen<br>is that you need to try to find<br>the gems among the many hundreds of tiny<br>projects that are just starting out<br>because those are your moon shots those<br>are the ones that are going to<br>potentially go from nothing to<br>exponentially massive in a in a<br>reasonably short space of time you would<br>hope<br>and<br>around that little bit of the market the<br>bottom bit of the market there's a lot<br>it's not a demure kind of hype<br>it's quite a crazy kind of hype<br>it's hugely risky and speculative it's a<br>bit like gambling on penny stocks<br>a large number as i say of those little<br>start-up things that you're going to try<br>and invest in are going to be scams<br>traders refer to these<br>low-cap speculative coins as coins<br>cover your<br>ears<br>and<br>you ape into them in the language so you<br>ape into a coin if you are<br>desperately trying to basically gamble<br>on the fact that this thing is going to<br>shoot up in value<br>there's i can see some some people start<br>giggling at this and that's because i<br>know that you're basically involved in<br>this sort of stuff right<br>so you recognize the the language that<br>i'm talking about<br>um<br>so that's that's seen as being a high<br>risk high reward due gen activity djing<br>being short for degenerate which is what<br>you are if you take part in crypto speak<br>in this sort of uh highly highly<br>speculative end of an already highly<br>speculative market<br>um degenerate it sounds quite pejorative<br>but actually it's more of a sort of term<br>of endearment as it's used in in the<br>crypto world world degenerates<br>so<br>the longest running meme in crypto is of<br>course the lambo if you catch a moonshot<br>maybe you'll get enough money to be able<br>to buy a lamborghini<br>lambos are going to the moon they're on<br>the moon and what you buy when you get<br>to the moon<br>there's even a website where if you've<br>got some bitcoin you can put it in and<br>they'll tell you what kind of lambo you<br>but will you get your lambo on the moon<br>by opening into coins<br>this is the question well<br>you can try but there's a lot of hurdles<br>to overcome first<br>and one of them is to try to avoid<br>becoming the victim of crime so let's<br>start i'm gonna start with three<br>examples in general to show you how<br>tricky this market is to navigate<br>as an investor and these three examples<br>will show<br>three things firstly market abuse is<br>normalized secondly you can lose money<br>very quickly and you'll come to expect<br>that as part of the normal course of<br>trading if uh if you're trading in<br>crypto for any sort of length of time<br>and thirdly the main method of crime<br>control is looking out for number one<br>and uh having your wits about you<br>there's no real sort of official<br>type of of crime control to speak of in<br>the space so let's look at the first one<br>of those the normalization of market<br>abuse<br>there are whales in the market so-called<br>whales who have<br>very very large numbers of<br>any given token<br>and<br>this chart here is uh i think called<br>true bit<br>and you can see it's kind of trending up<br>and like there's a green grind up there<br>and then just before may the fourth<br>there's a big green line that goes<br>straight down from the top right down to<br>the bottom<br>and what's happened there is that a<br>whale<br>who's got a huge number of the tokens of<br>by in a way that i wouldn't go into<br>has decided once it's got up to a<br>certain price he's going to dump it and<br>so he dumps all of his coins at the top<br>and it crashes the price doesn't crash<br>it all the way down but it crashes it a<br>good bit down<br>other traders will have set<br>trailing stop losses maybe five or ten<br>percent trailing behind the price as it<br>is what that means is that if the price<br>goes down their tokens will be<br>automatically sold just like stock<br>market stock losses to try and protect<br>you against those sorts of losses so if<br>the whale sells all of his coins and<br>dumps through those stop losses all<br>those tokens get sold as well and that<br>dumps the price even further at this<br>point all the regular joes like me i was<br>watching this as it happened look at it<br>and think oh my god this is going to<br>zero this is just going straight down<br>and it was a massive red line<br>down the middle of the screen and you<br>saw you try and panic sell everything<br>you just got to get out before it goes<br>to it goes to zero<br>um i didn't manage that because my<br>computer interface froze up because so<br>many people were trying to sell out of<br>it so i didn't even fortunately in the<br>end as it turns out i didn't manage to<br>do it um<br>so so yeah the price dumps incredibly<br>quickly through this manipulation<br>but um the line's not not red it's green<br>why is it green well because it went<br>right down from 1.40 to 20 cents and at<br>the bottom the whale that sold at the<br>top fought back in again<br>took all the money that he'd got at the<br>top this was like five minutes ago<br>bought back in at the bottom<br>exponentially increased over six to ten<br>times the number of tokens that he owns<br>in the thing it goes shooting back up<br>again he's basically taking the tokens<br>off all the panic sellers like me as<br>would have been but didn't quite manage<br>it and then after that normal normal<br>trading resumes<br>um<br>so this kind of manipulation is it sort<br>of hangs over the market and the the<br>feeling for minnow traders is that<br>um<br>you're being thrown around on these sort<br>of waves of other people's trades that<br>you can't even think about getting close<br>to with the sort of volume that you're<br>talking about<br>and<br>so you come to terms basically with the<br>fact that the market is manipulated<br>and that kind of manipulation is<br>important context for understanding<br>it dilutes the outrage or the surprise<br>that you feel<br>if<br>you become a victim of some sort of<br>criminal event because you are anyway<br>thinking that the market is full of<br>people who are deliberately deploying<br>underhand tactics in order to try to<br>maneuver you into bad trades<br>so you don't quite feel so um offended<br>by the whole thing<br>if if manipulation veers into very<br>serious criminality<br>point number two the normalization of<br>sometimes projects just give up<br>the developer and the marketing guys<br>sort of say<br>what the hell with this um<br>but we've had enough we'll sell all more<br>stuff<br>and that's the end of it<br>the first time this happened to me i<br>thought like can they do this is this is<br>this allowed<br>well yeah apparently they can um here's<br>an example of one that happened to me<br>you um come home from work and you see<br>that the chart has just gone through the<br>floor and you think oh god please say<br>the chart's broken and then you go and<br>search around on twitter or the telegram<br>so i find out what's happened and you<br>get a message like this the future is<br>quite dark<br>and we're abruptly ending and uh and so<br>that's it game over end off i think i<br>so<br>there are a multitude of ways that if<br>you exist in crypto space for any length<br>of time you can encounter catastrophic<br>loss<br>um and you have to countenance that as a<br>possible outcome because<br>it's always there hanging over you again<br>that's important context for scams<br>because<br>having come to expect some instances of<br>very serious loss as part of the whole<br>normal course of trading when scams<br>occur their importance sort of fades<br>into the background of that<br>finally<br>in this trifecta of sort of contextual<br>things for scams<br>there's no real crime control in the<br>market and you've got to look out for<br>yourself this is a nice project called<br>soul starter there's a a startup<br>blockchain that's very popular in trendy<br>called solana and everybody's been<br>waiting for the soul starter project and<br>here it is and we're all buying in lots<br>of buys<br>um great so let's get stuck in<br>and um more people keep buying after you<br>and the price goes up and then at some<br>point you get to the point where you<br>think well safety first i'll take a bit<br>of profit off the top here i'll sell<br>sell something just to to<br>make sure that i'm i'm not got<br>everything riding on this and you go to<br>sell and you find you can't sell because<br>it's a scam it's a scam token and the<br>developer has programmed it so that you<br>can buy it but you can't sell it<br>and that's why that's all buys usually<br>in any sort of regular trading it would<br>be interspersed with red cells and so<br>then you go because there's no sort of<br>chat interface in the charting mechanism<br>you're going to have a bit of a look<br>around and you find the real soul<br>starter on twitter and on telegram<br>saying um we haven't launched yet be<br>careful there's a lot of scams out there<br>so we've got a few wild west things<br>building up here don't we in relation to<br>crypto we've got rampant price<br>manipulation we've got projects getting<br>liquidated at a moment's notice we've<br>got cyber crimes to do with the way the<br>technology can be exploited<br>we're building a picture of a space<br>without too many rules in which scammers<br>find ideal victims people with<br>a pretty loose risk radar who know that<br>the market is seriously manipulated<br>they're not really expecting fairness or<br>good behavior from everyone else people<br>who are used to losing money and who<br>treat it as just part of the regular<br>grind of being in the market<br>uh<br>a space where people dream of lambos on<br>the moon and they chase the latest hype<br>where they're not going to call the<br>police because<br>uh they're used to this sort of<br>pervasive dodginess and they have a<br>sense that there's there's no point in<br>reporting any of this sort of stuff<br>and to cap it all as if that's not<br>enough you've got the anonymity of the<br>internet which means that in these chat<br>forums i'm talking about<br>the developers the scam developers can<br>get right up close to you they can talk<br>to you they can persuade you to give<br>them your money in various different<br>ways and then they can disappear and<br>it's all pseudonymous you'll never know<br>who they were you'll never know where<br>they were<br>they can just disappear into thin air i<br>was looking for a<br>slide to encode to sum up the anonymity<br>of the internet and um<br>and then this morning uh a good one<br>popped up on one of the crypto forums<br>i'll just have a drink of water and i'll<br>yes<br>so the scene is set for scams to<br>flourish let's take a look at some of<br>them i've i've split the scams up into<br>um<br>into three categories advanced fee fraud<br>rug pools and first and best dressed and<br>i've got two examples of um of each of<br>them<br>now let's look at the giveaway scam to<br>start off with the most<br>basic thing a scam has to do is to seem<br>legitimate if you can spot it as being<br>an obvious scam then you're not really<br>going to<br>take part in it for the giveaway scam<br>the way that people seem legitimate is<br>they uh set up fake twitter accounts in<br>the names of big crypto influencers and<br>players<br>and<br>um<br>they'll say that they're going to do a<br>giveaway in order to try to promote<br>crypto you send them one bitcoin they'll<br>send you five back whatever<br>the variant of it is and you send them<br>the bitcoin you never see it again<br>so<br>one of the things you find when you look<br>at the twitter handles of some of the<br>big influencers is that they're pending<br>to their twitter hand these are the<br>legit guys i'm not giving anything away<br>this is this i don't think i'm i'm<br>nobody's giving anything away um and if<br>somebody's trying to give you something<br>then it's a scam<br>so the giveaway scam is a form of<br>advanced fee fraud which is a category<br>of crime that covers uh any sort of<br>myriad version of the same basic premise<br>i've got something valuable to give you<br>uh so to release it send me a payment<br>you send me a little of something i'll<br>send you a lot back if you think back to<br>the days before<br>effective spam filters you used to get<br>all those emails from people that were<br>constantly wanting to give you money and<br>they had a trust fund somewhere and they<br>would need just a small amount of money<br>to unlock the legal fees to<br>that was advanced fee fraud um and the<br>giveaway scam in crypto is of the same<br>time<br>and many scams and the giveaway is a<br>good example we have an offer that seems<br>to be too good to be true i'm sure you<br>know the the consumer awareness advice<br>which is if it seems too good to be true<br>it probably is it's very hard to live by<br>that advice though um as a human being<br>because temptation gets the better of us<br>sometimes and it can outweigh reticence<br>and rationality and so if the offer<br>seems beneficial enough<br>a lot of us will<br>persuade ourselves that it's legitimate<br>just because we so desperately want it<br>to be so<br>and<br>so we change reality to fit with what<br>we'd like to believe instead of doing<br>what we should do which is change what<br>we believe in order to fit reality<br>the old scam literature calls this the<br>triumph of hope over experience<br>offers are also sometimes made to be<br>time sensitive<br>um you're given the idea that if you<br>pass up the chance somebody else will<br>jump in and and so thank you very quick<br>now um quite obviously i guess<br>time sensitive offers are hardly limited<br>just to scams in crypto or scams<br>anywhere else time limited offers are<br>everywhere in the consumer world it's<br>quite a well-used persuasive technique<br>and<br>that kind of dilutes your capacity to<br>identify scams because if that sort of<br>stuff is everywhere in conventional<br>society maybe this is a legitimate offer<br>maybe this person does want to do a<br>giveaway maybe this is a time sensitive<br>i better jump on a quick situation<br>that's that's legit<br>so there's three core scams uh core<br>themes of scams to get us started an<br>appearance of legitimacy an offer that<br>seems too good to be true and a time<br>pressure<br>and uh the latest high-profile case of<br>this happened when elon musk was on<br>saturday night live which was i think<br>may of uh<br>of this year and<br>at the time that elon went he was the<br>guest host on saturday night live and<br>he's quite a big fan of bitcoin he's<br>been promoting dogecoin and other<br>cryptos as well<br>and uh some scammers went into his<br>twitter feed they set up fake saturday<br>night live<br>accounts and they pointed people towards<br>this giveaway page where they said elon<br>musk is giving away bitcoin and you give<br>him<br>one bitcoin he'll send you 10 anything<br>you send basically you'll multiply by<br>10. i found out about this because some<br>per guy in the uk was in the papers<br>because he'd sent off 10 bitcoin hoping<br>to get 100 back so that was 400 000<br>pounds that he just sent off<br>into into nowhere<br>this guy is the the unlikely looking<br>billionaire owner of<br>uh one of the biggest cryptocurrencies<br>called cardano and he gives these kind<br>of live stream updates to all of his<br>followers about what's happening with<br>the project every week or so he's<br>actually giving this update live<br>streamed but he's not giving it there<br>he's giving it on his own website and<br>the scammers are pulling the live stream<br>in real time through to their own<br>website sticking it in this thing with<br>gifts all around it and offers to um to<br>do giveaways in order to try to entice<br>you into thinking that charles hoskinson<br>is going to give you some cardano which<br>of course he's not<br>and we're not learning you would think<br>that the more this happens the more<br>people would get wise to it but actually<br>it's just getting worse and we're the<br>figures of 2021 i mean we're only um<br>halfway through 2021 so a<br>fear of course that that's going to get<br>a lot bigger<br>before the years out<br>so that's an example of a scam where you<br>the victim think you've get an amazingly<br>good deal you're too good to resist you<br>can't too good to think rationally about<br>but there are other scams where that<br>desire to get the best side of a bargain<br>goes even further where you're prepared<br>to cheat or you're prepared to take<br>advantage of someone<br>to get the good end of the deal<br>and the cry for help<br>is one of those scams<br>i've got robert redford here doing the<br>cry for help way back when<br>see if you can work out<br>give it to me please get you with a<br>knife i use a title man you need a<br>you wonder by the law or something no<br>are you nuts carrying a water on like<br>that in a neighborhood like this no<br>wonder

holding out on them<br>my wife got sick and i had to pay the<br>bills i wasn't holding out on them stuff<br>i've always been looking for the money<br>before but this guy in the game<br>all right will you ain't a tough guy in<br>the world that's kind of frisky there<br>where to which way is mason 20 block<br>south<br>what's so funny<br>i just made the world's easiest five<br>grand<br>so that's the cry for help scan the<br>scammer finds some sort of vulnerability<br>asks for your assistance<br>you decide that you're not going to help<br>him you're actually going to rip him off<br>and you think you're ripping him off but<br>actually he's ripping you off<br>this is the<br>crypto version of the cry for help scam<br>there's two things you need to<br>understand in order to make sense of the<br>way this all works firstly<br>you keep your cryptocurrency in an<br>online wallet it's like an app on your<br>phone or a little thing in your browser<br>it's a bit like internet banking<br>you look at it it looks like like if you<br>look at internet banking it looks like<br>your money's there but your money's not<br>there your money's in the bank well with<br>um crypto it looks like your coins are<br>in your wallet they're not there it's<br>just an interface to see your coins are<br>on the blockchain somewhere<br>and every wallet is backed up with a<br>seed phrase a passcode<br>so you can recreate the wallet anywhere<br>with the seed phrase if you want to have<br>it on your laptop and on your<br>desktop then you just download the<br>software put the seed phrase in on your<br>laptop you've made the wallet there<br>it'll show you all your coins because it<br>has the same access to it than anything<br>else does if your computer blows up you<br>can get a new computer you can download<br>the software put the c phrase in<br>and uh it's all good so the one thing<br>that you know in crypto the first thing<br>you learn is you never tell anyone your<br>seed phrase because if they've got your<br>seed phrase they can download the<br>software they can put the seed phrase in<br>they've got your access to your wallet<br>they've got access to your tokens<br>and you're in a bit of trouble<br>so here we have apparently<br>a victim in a chat forum saying<br>something's wrong with my wallet can<br>somebody help me here's my seed phrase<br>the second thing you need to know<br>in order to understand the scam is<br>obviously people then look at that and<br>if they're mean-minded they think i'm<br>gonna steal this crypto so they put the<br>seed phrase into the wallet they make<br>his wallet on their computer they find<br>that they can't steal the crypto because<br>and this is the second thing you need to<br>know<br>um on a blockchain like ethereum you<br>need to have a small amount of gas to<br>pay the transaction fee if you want to<br>move any coins around or do any swaps or<br>anything you'll have a small amount of<br>ether which is the base currency in your<br>wallet in order to make it all work and<br>this guy has loaded up his wallet with<br>ten thousand dollars in this case of<br>crypto but no ether so you can see it<br>you can't steal it<br>easily fixed all you need to do is send<br>some meter into the wallet for the gas<br>then you can take it out but he's made a<br>bot that monitors the wallet every time<br>any ether goes into the wallet it<br>immediately pings it out to his own<br>wallet so<br>the cry for help you think you're<br>stealing his crypto he's stealing your<br>ether<br>and because all this is on the<br>blockchain you can<br>look at the transactions that go through<br>these wallets because the blockchain is<br>all public this is that wallet this is<br>page one of page three of six 284<br>transactions at the time that that<br>snapshot was taken and you just need to<br>look at the ins and outs not really<br>anything else it's just ether in ether<br>ether any throughout there were loads of<br>people who were trying to steal this<br>guy's crypto<br>rock pools the slow token rug sit well i<br>mean to start off with let's just say in<br>terms of things with a long history exit<br>scams rock pools are a thing that's got<br>a long history uh pulling people into a<br>good standing investment and then taking<br>all the money and running that's a<br>that's a pretty old uh routine<br>so<br>um<br>what happens is that the developer who<br>has launched a new token has actually<br>kept a whole load of the tokens for<br>himself he's got maybe 80 of the tokens<br>probably and he's sold 20 of them you<br>might not know that he's only sold the<br>20 percent<br>and while you're buying<br>he's selling<br>and he's selling over a long period of<br>time it's like a slow puncture in a<br>balloon<br>so you're basically buying the tokens<br>that he's selling over time it's never<br>going to come back up because he's got<br>so many of these things it's just going<br>to end in zero eventually it's just a<br>matter of time before it does<br>and he's in the telegram group and he's<br>chatting away while he's stealing your<br>money<br>and this is what irving goffman called<br>cooling the mark out in a paper that's<br>become a classic in criminology cooling<br>the market was the process of staying<br>with the victim during and after a scam<br>and<br>trying to make sure they didn't call the<br>police<br>so the way con artists would do this was<br>through what goffman referred to as<br>cooling them out or in other words<br>helping them adapt to failure and<br>educating them in the philosophy of<br>so the scammer would persuade the victim<br>that maybe it was an unfortunate mishap<br>and the surefire money-making scheme had<br>gone wrong somehow and he knew the risks<br>and and um he only had themselves<br>himself to blame should chuck it up to<br>experience and move on with life that<br>sort of thing<br>and this process of cooling out is<br>everywhere in society again like the<br>consumer um high pressure sales<br>situation if you've ever been told by a<br>girlfriend or a boyfriend that it's not<br>you it's them then you've been cooled<br>out<br>uh if you've ever phoned up to try to<br>get a refund for your washing machine<br>and they said well you know they'd be a<br>lot more expensive if you made them<br>properly these days nothing's supposed<br>to last for longer than three years and<br>maybe it's an opportunity to get a new<br>one and you know<br>cooling out is everywhere and crypto<br>scammers are experts in cooling out<br>they'll be in the chat and they'll be<br>telling you that the dip is just early<br>buyers selling they'll be saying that it<br>pumped a lot at the beginning and it's<br>kind of natural that there's a bit of a<br>dip they'll say there's loads of other<br>successful tokens out there that have<br>gone on to great things and in the<br>beginning they dipped you've got to have<br>diamond hands not paper hands in other<br>words<br>scared money doesn't make money you've<br>got to hold on and get through it and<br>all the time they're selling the grind<br>out from underneath your feet<br>and eventually it'll become clear that<br>it's not going to recover and they might<br>say well crypto's risky and everybody<br>knows that and they'll say<br>i was heavily invested in this and i've<br>lost as much as anyone<br>and there'll always be other<br>opportunities so let's just go and look<br>for the next moonshot try and make it<br>all back so the idea of cooling out is<br>as relevant to crypto crimes in 2021 as<br>it was to the con games 100 years ago<br>and then there's fast drugs or liquidity<br>pools<br>now<br>this is where your<br>knowledge of pancakes and unicorns and<br>token<br>tokens and defy swaps come you remember<br>that don't you yeah of course you do<br>that mechanism creates a rug opportunity<br>and so here's how it goes a developer<br>will make a public sale of their token<br>and in order to put liquidity in a pool<br>you need to put in if it's ethereum say<br>let's call their token that they're<br>selling rug they're selling a rug token<br>and so they'll put a matching amount of<br>of rugged ether in the liquidity pool<br>now you want to buy rug<br>you pay an ether<br>you take out some rug you want to sell<br>the rug back<br>sell the rug back get some ether in<br>return in the early stages of any cr any<br>sale what's going to happen is<br>everybody's going to be buying rug and<br>everybody's going to pay an ether to buy<br>the rug<br>at some point<br>there's so much ether in that liquidity<br>pool and if it's not locked up there's a<br>technical way you can lock it up but it<br>doesn't always happen the developer<br>who's the one who put it in can just<br>pull it all out<br>take everything away with them massive<br>exit scam and that's the kind of chart<br>you get<br>this is this is a guy called war on<br>ruggs who was like a vigilante type who<br>prior to this<br>had gone around twitter sort of auditing<br>his unofficial self-appointed auditor of<br>projects that might be scams and he<br>would alert people to the fact that some<br>things might be scammed so he was kind<br>of a<br>seemingly a force for good and then he<br>launched his own token a couple of<br>months ago and he rugged it<br>and if you read down the bottom he's<br>saying<br>since we can't do anything and there's<br>no regulation in place i decided to show<br>you so you understand that you should<br>stop being a clown and aping into<br>anything<br>hopefully after this you don't trust<br>anyone anymore<br>i i guess i mean i should say i'm not<br>with these burning elbows and everything<br>remember i'm not really i'm not trying<br>to make light of this this is a very<br>serious amount of money being lost in<br>all of this these crypto memes are<br>crypto memes i'm not<br>going away from this lecture thinking<br>that was quite interesting but man he<br>wants to spend a lot of time making<br>those dragon gifts i i didn't i didn't<br>make them they're uh<br>they're the work of of the crypto market<br>itself<br>so<br>um<br>this is some on-chain analysis where<br>people were looking at the number of<br>rugs in 24 hours 3003 transactions of<br>total liquidity removal<br>an address that's literally spending all<br>day<br>minting coins and potentially<br>netting six figures by rug pulling<br>innocent bystanders<br>and then somebody's a bit rude about the<br>and yeah there's memes about it of<br>course<br>um<br>i mean i suppose you do get hardened to<br>it the more it carries on<br>but<br>bear in mind what i said earlier about<br>the opportunities that are down at a<br>very low level<br>people apping into things it's very hard<br>to tell in the early stages of tiny<br>crypto tokens there's no information<br>really to let you know whether something<br>is legit or whether it's a rug it's<br>incredibly hard to tell<br>the temptation to get involved is huge<br>and so<br>um<br>there's lots of money pouring into it<br>and it's very tempting for developers to<br>to rug it when they see that amount of<br>i don't know what mouse farm tokens are<br>there's so much going on that sometimes<br>you can't really keep track of it i<br>think you can farm anything these days<br>mice cake<br>it's all part of the same thing but<br>there's no one to hold your hand in<br>crypto<br>the pump and dump<br>there's a saying<br>in the old scam literature that we can't<br>cheat an honest man<br>here's<br>telegram routine<br>there's been a mistake in my change all<br>right long lasting honest man want to<br>return somebody no i'm sure coke brag<br>about it i'm only five feet eight for<br>percent i mean i'm shorting my money no<br>mistakes rick the fight i have towards<br>leaving the window you're dishonest<br>dishonest<br>me shack shadrach and the pentagon you<br>cheated us how you imbued my honor<br>my 80 year old<br>lick box said just before the sprung the<br>trap he said you can't cheat an honest<br>man<br>never give a sucker and even break or<br>smarten up a chump we want what's coming<br>to us i'm gonna get it too you are yeah<br>you too yeah come on give it to us you<br>so you can't see an honest man never<br>give a sucker and even break or smarten<br>up a jump well it's not it's just not of<br>course true that you can't cheat an<br>honest man<br>but there's a diluted version of that i<br>mean in some cases the scam revolves<br>around that the cry for help scan that<br>we saw revolves around the idea that you<br>can't cheat an honest man if you hadn't<br>tried to steal his crypto he wouldn't<br>have been able to steal your ether<br>um in pump and dumps we see a slightly<br>diluted version of that idea which is<br>that<br>you think the deal is loaded in your<br>favor when in fact it's loaded against<br>so here's trump's pumps and dumps<br>i don't think it's actually donald trump<br>but who knows possibly<br>and what they're doing is they're saying<br>that they're going to pump a coin<br>they ramp it up with a countdown they<br>get all of their followers and telegram<br>heated in expectation and the idea is<br>that when they announce the coin<br>you jump in the coin pumps and you make<br>lots of money<br>except that's not what's really<br>happening what's really happening is<br>that they've been buying the coin<br>already a long time before they pump it<br>and when you buy it supposedly on the<br>pump announcement what you're doing is<br>providing them with extra liquidity in<br>other words they've bought low and they<br>want to sell high they need someone to<br>sell to<br>well that's you<br>and so you're buying<br>their coins as they're selling them out<br>and what you see is these incredible<br>pumps the call there was made at six<br>o'clock i couldn't get six o'clock<br>because it only does it an hour so i've<br>got 540 there so actually the point at<br>which you knew to buy that coin you're<br>almost up at the top of the peak anyway<br>and they've been buying it all the way<br>up and they're selling it into that pump<br>right up to the top where it gets to a<br>point they think right now it's the top<br>we're going to<br>let it all go<br>you think you're getting pumped you're<br>actually getting<br>dumped<br>and that's the visual representation of<br>what's happening to you there um one of<br>the things that makes it so successful<br>is a thing called the gambler's fallacy<br>where you tend to think that you are<br>quite close to winning it and maybe you<br>should try again so the gambler's fast<br>if you play the fruit machines you get<br>you're looking for three cherries you<br>get two cherries and you got a pineapple<br>but the third cherry was just there it<br>almost came down you're so close you<br>should try again well this one<br>it has that same sort of mechanism about<br>it you were so close you just needed to<br>get in a bit earlier and maybe you would<br>have made some more money and so they<br>end up extorting<br>from the same clientele in tranches over<br>and over and over again it's not even a<br>one-hit scam it's something that goes on<br>and then finally perhaps the classic<br>the ponzi scheme<br>pretty old routines ponzi schemes a<br>ponzi scheme is an investment vehicle<br>that pays out existing subscribers using<br>proceeds received from new recruits it's<br>inherently unstable for that reason they<br>always fall apart in the end<br>but the profits made by those who are<br>first through the door are made at the<br>expense of those who come later<br>and in spring 2021 earlier this year<br>there was a rash of tokens meme based<br>tokens that<br>purported to sort of reinvent finance by<br>calling themselves auto staking and<br>basically what happens is they're not<br>really doing anything other than every<br>time there's a transaction they take a 5<br>or 10 transaction fee and they<br>redistribute that transaction fee to<br>existing holders of the token using<br>the coins that they've got at their<br>disposal so you buy in and you get more<br>coins the more people buy in and<br>hopefully the thing gets<br>bigger and bigger<br>just like the dexes were all food<br>related these ones are all animal<br>related<br>mostly dogs<br>i guess if it's not broke don't fix it<br>i pulled a road map for one of these to<br>show you just exactly what sort of thing<br>you're dealing with often if it's a<br>legit crypto project there'll be a road<br>map which has milestones on it they'll<br>publish that for investors so you might<br>want to sort of think about looking at<br>that if you're thinking about investing<br>maybe they're going to make some<br>technology or um or build a bridge to<br>conventional finance and they'll have<br>these sort of phases here's the phases<br>of a<br>of a dog ponzi phase one<br>make a website<br>get listed you have to get the listings<br>of those<br>charts that i've been producing if you<br>don't get listed there'll be no chart<br>nobody will be able to find you there's<br>no real<br>vetting process for getting listed as<br>more just like you that you join so make<br>a website get listed commence heavy<br>marketing phase two<br>continue heavy marketing telegram<br>members telegram members<br>phase three continue heavy marketing<br>this is 100 marketing there's nothing<br>else going on here besides marketing<br>um<br>there was i think it was jfk's dad joe<br>kennedy who uh<br>famously said<br>um if the shoeshine boy is giving you<br>stock tips it's time to sell everything<br>if there's<br>dog ponzi schemes being advertised in<br>times square in new york<br>it's time to get out of the crypto<br>market i saw this<br>i didn't get out of the crypto market<br>i should have and the alarm bells were<br>ringing<br>and it didn't work<br>so there's a sort of accelerated<br>capitalist logic about these ponzi<br>schemes the weird thing that happens is<br>that the more that people recognize<br>what's going on and now people have<br>pretty much started to recognize what's<br>going on it turns into gambling and<br>you know that the only way that you're<br>going to win is by front running<br>everybody else you've got to get in and<br>out really quickly before the whole<br>thing collapses but everybody knows that<br>now so everybody's trying to front run<br>everybody else so what you get is these<br>huge initial pumps in the first few<br>hours and then massive dumps that just<br>go down into nothing loads of people<br>lose lots of money some people win some<br>money in the early stages but it's that<br>sort of pushing forward of the timeline<br>i mean crypto's a very accelerated<br>so here's the conclusion new technology<br>new economy<br>familiar criminal routines we've stepped<br>out of the world of conventional finance<br>and we've found a lot that's new but we<br>haven't really found much about the<br>scams that's new have we what we found<br>is more like endless variations on old<br>themes of enticement deception<br>confidence tricks<br>like d5 which itself has classic themes<br>and endless variations<br>the pancakes and the unicorns and the<br>sushi and what have you and like memes<br>too which circulate in a constant<br>evolving stream of repetition and slight<br>alteration criminal fraud here has<br>become a defined meme repeated ad<br>nauseam in a vortex of permutations of<br>some common basic roots and so if you<br>are pumped and dumped or if you're rug<br>pulled or if you ape too late into a<br>ponzi token if you send bitcoin to an<br>address in the hope of getting more back<br>or if you fall for a honeypot cry for<br>help scam<br>you are part of an old story of crime<br>and deception<br>that's been playing out since long<br>before cryptocurrency was the hot new<br>money-making scheme<br>old wine and new bottles you might say<br>are plus orange or maybe<br>our crypto dj and friends would say<br>same different day<br>now if you go home tonight and tell<br>people that you went to a professorial<br>inaugural election the conclusion was<br>um if you if you can bear with me for<br>two more minutes<br>if anyone wants to leave that's fine<br>please do please do i realize i've gone<br>a little bit over but i'd like to do a<br>couple of acknowledgements i'd like to<br>say<br>um thanks to the university and to all<br>the wonderful people who work here and<br>of course my friends in the school of<br>social and cultural studies and the<br>institute of criminology<br>excellent scholars and and teachers and<br>fun and rewarding places<br>to be academic<br>the second acknowledgement is the<br>european research council who provided<br>the funding that supported the research<br>and my colleagues on the wider project<br>that this is a small part of they are<br>dona yes and annette hubstrate and<br>diana berzina at the universities of<br>maastricht and cape town<br>and then i want to<br>mention and thank four academics who've<br>been particularly influential in my<br>career peter young was the professor who<br>first taught me criminology at edinburgh<br>university and as grant said i went on<br>to be a lawyer for three years after<br>that until i realized that i really<br>wanted to be a criminologist so i went<br>back and speak to peter<br>by whether it's possible to be a<br>criminologist as a profession and he<br>said yes sure it is and uh you should go<br>to cambridge which i never would have<br>thought of and he said you should apply<br>for a scholarship to cambridge and<br>here's the forums to fill out as well<br>and so thanks to him this all happened<br>um an amazing sort of early support show<br>of support and then at cambridge i met<br>ken polk who would be my phd supervisor<br>he was visiting from melbourne at the<br>time and he said you should come to<br>melbourne and do a phd and so i did and<br>he taught me all about white collar<br>crime<br>and um<br>the end<br>of the phd i told him that sally and i<br>were going to move back to london<br>and he said you should go and see penny<br>green<br>who was the professor of criminology at<br>the university of westminster at the<br>time<br>and<br>so i did go to see penny green and turns<br>out she was looking for a lecture in<br>criminology and criminal law so she gave<br>me my first job in academia and um penny<br>is somebody who<br>personifies<br>the<br>link between social justice and<br>criminology she was i always kind of<br>knew it<br>but um she really did it the idea that<br>criminology can change the world for the<br>better um i think that's uh something<br>that the penny sort of lives by she's<br>never<br>the head of the international state<br>crime initiative<br>um after that i went to keel university<br>i was a lecturer there for a little bit<br>uh there's too many people there to say<br>hi to so if anybody's watching the video<br>hello and and um thanks for all the fun<br>times and then at glasgow for i was<br>there for 10 years before i came here<br>and i worked with michelle berman now<br>michelle berman obe<br>who<br>as well as being a fantastic scholar has<br>inspire other people to be their best<br>she sets up structures that allow other<br>people to succeed it's a very selfless<br>and clever thing to do and she certainly<br>did it for me she<br>she<br>is a large part of the reason why<br>what success i've had i've had<br>and so i want to<br>tell these people that they are valued<br>and to<br>acknowledge them and tell them that i'm<br>basically now spending<br>most of my career trying to pay forward<br>the kindness and the generosity that<br>they showed to me<br>um thoroughly decent human beings and<br>and good friends<br>now<br>i didn't become a bitcoin millionaire<br>but<br>i did get a lambo<br>good evening i'm professor sarah leggett<br>i'm the dean of the faculty of<br>humanities and social sciences te<br>wahanga<br>and it's my privilege this evening to<br>offer the vote of thanks on behalf of us<br>all to professor simon mckenzie for his<br>excellent inaugural lecture as professor<br>of criminology at taheringawaka victoria<br>university of wellington<br>professor simon mckenzie is an<br>internationally renowned expert in the<br>field of global illegal markets his<br>groundbreaking scholarship has advanced<br>both a practical and theoretical<br>understanding of global criminal trade<br>from trafficking in drugs and arms to<br>the illicit trade of wildlife diamonds<br>and antiquities<br>through to the extreme harm caused by<br>the terrible reality of human<br>trafficking<br>but this evening simon has taken us into<br>a new realm of illicit trade and<br>transnational criminal activity with his<br>analysis of the scams currently<br>flourishing in the new and alternate<br>financial system that is the crypto<br>market<br>simon's insightful and entertaining<br>inaugural professorial lecture this<br>evening has given us all a glimpse of<br>the high-tech potentially high-yield yet<br>undoubtedly high-risk world of crypto<br>this is a world that is or at least was<br>until this evening very unfamiliar to me<br>and i imagine too many people in the<br>room tonight so we've all learned a<br>great deal simon from your inaugural<br>lecture and we're immensely appreciative<br>a relatively new and a highly<br>technological space the unregulated<br>global economy that is the crypto market<br>is a space of speed volatility and<br>opportunity seemingly rife with<br>manipulation and deception<br>the growth of crypto trading via<br>decentralized exchanges with the lack of<br>regulation facilitates deceptive and<br>criminal activity from low-level scams<br>and fraud to tax evasion and money<br>laundering<br>simon has introduced us to some of the<br>schemes new schemes such as the pump and<br>dump and rig pools and schemes that<br>maybe were more familiar to us<br>but what's more simon's lecture this<br>evening has given us a fascinating<br>insight into the whole new language and<br>culture that have emerged from crypto<br>trading that he has helpfully translated<br>for us from the shilling of coins to<br>moon shots from blue chips to coins<br>terms probably necessitating this<br>translation<br>the need to consider pumpamentos of a<br>project from fomo and of course through<br>to the ultimate aspiration of the lambo<br>this is a world that for many of us is<br>new unfamiliar modern and seems both<br>complex and somewhat intimidating<br>but what simon has argued in his<br>illuminating inaugural tonight is that<br>this world and its associated practices<br>of deception is not really so new nor<br>innovative that the deception and scams<br>in the market<br>are versions of age-old criminal ruses<br>and considering the impact and harm of<br>these scams<br>i think simon's own words from his<br>earlier book on transnational<br>criminology are pertinent<br>there simon describes trafficking as a<br>form of morally indifferent capitalism<br>suggesting that in a generally hostile<br>and uncompassionate world criminal<br>markets are underpinned by a<br>globalization of indifference in which<br>crime and the harm caused by illegal<br>markets is compartmentalized overlooked<br>in a similar vein simon has spoken this<br>evening of the way in which the scams<br>and deception and crypto trading have<br>become normalized are considered to come<br>with the territory in this unregulated<br>wild west and that traders are expected<br>to take personal responsibility for the<br>implications of their activity in this<br>market<br>we're therefore also grateful to simon<br>for highlighting this because thanks to<br>tonight's inaugural lecture if we should<br>choose to venture into this unregulated<br>speculative world we'll be forewarned to<br>be alert to djinn plays to look out for<br>whales to not just succumb to fomo and<br>to avoid aping too late as we navigate<br>the complex crypto market<br>so thank you simon for sharing these<br>insights this is fascinating and highly<br>informative work and your inaugural has<br>i think highlighted for us that we are<br>extremely fortunate to have such an<br>internationally renowned scholar here as<br>professor of criminology after heading a<br>walkout victoria university of<br>wellington<br>it's now my pleasure to invite everyone<br>to stay and join us for refreshments in<br>the foyer outside the lecture theatre<br>but before we adjourn there please join<br>me in thanking our simon mckenzie again<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
