font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>heart attacks occur due to blockages in<br>the arteries to the heart<br>this is the leading cause of death and<br>harm to people worldwide<br>heart surgeons have been performing<br>bypass grafting operations to treat this<br>problem for over 60 years<br>surgeons have found that using the<br>arteries from the forearms and the<br>arteries from inside the breastbone last<br>longer than the veins from the legs<br>however surgeons disagree as to the best<br>way to arrange these arterial grafts for<br>a particular patient<br>now imagine if you had blockages in the<br>arteries to your heart and one surgeon<br>would arrange your grafts in one way<br>another surgeon would arrange in another<br>way and yet another surgeon will do it<br>another different way<br>now your bypass grafts are only going to<br>last if there's enough blood flow going<br>down them and if there's not they're<br>going to fail and you could end up with<br>another heart attack or you could even<br>die<br>currently there's no good way to predict<br>this ahead of time<br>in my research i created a computer<br>model that could predict flows down<br>bypass graphs and classify each grafting<br>option as being<br>unsatisfactory satisfactory or optimal<br>i then looked at 12 grafting<br>configurations used by surgeons around<br>the world<br>of which three are shown on the slide<br>behind me as you can see from the top<br>right hand corner of the slide the third<br>option is the most complex as it's based<br>on only a single inflow<br>i then asked 16 heart surgeons 1 6 of<br>whom eight were senior experts and eight<br>junior novices to select their preferred<br>grafting option for each of five<br>different patients<br>and what i found was that each surgeon<br>tended to select the exact same drafting<br>configuration for each of the five<br>patients thereby representing a<br>one-size-fits-all approach<br>i also found that surgeons who were<br>using the complex configurations like<br>the third one shown on the slide behind<br>me well they were selecting lots of<br>unsatisfactory crafting configurations<br>however after seeing the computer<br>model's predictions<br>the majority of surgeons changed their<br>unsatisfactory grafting selections to<br>satisfactory ones or even optimal ones<br>interestingly the novice surgeons were<br>actually better than the experts at<br>selecting the optimal graphing<br>configurations under the influence of<br>the computer model<br>therefore in conclusion my research has<br>shown that computer aided decision<br>making for heart bypass surgery leads<br>the selection of better grafting options<br>for patients that will ultimately last<br>longer in the long term<br>now i ask you<br>imagine you had blockages in the<br>arteries to your heart<br>what would you prefer to mend your<br>broken heart<br>thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
