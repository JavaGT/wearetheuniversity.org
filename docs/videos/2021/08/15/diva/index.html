But this is very time consuming.<br>I remember myself,<br>having to collect this data on an Excel spreadsheet.<br>And if a patient later on came in with a complication,<br>I needed to go back and put that information in. <br>It was a lot of work, and I just didn't have enough time. <br>What you need is everybody helping you collect the data, so we created DIVA.<br>DIVA captures each patient admission automatically from<br>the hospital systems. The registrars input data at key time points,<br>such as after an operation and after discharge. When they log into DIVA,<br>they have a dashboard to keep track of which records to complete.<br>Then once a week, I log into DIVA check the completed records<br>and sign them off.<br>Because everyone in the team is contributing,<br>it's pretty quick and simple.<br>This is what I love about DIVA: You can get your logbook<br>at the click of a button. And from this,<br>you can see how you're doing, <br>when infections, anastomotic leaks, mortality.<br>You can select cases for a discussion<br>at M&amp;M meetings.<br>You can even generate custom data extracts for important research questions.<br>Over the last 30 years here at the University of Otago,<br>DIVA has been and continues to be developed by surgeons, for surgeons.<br>With DIVA you'll instantly comply with college requirements, you'll save<br>time and you'll be able to say exactly what your figures are.<br>Getting DIVA is easy. The next step would be to contact<br>us and we one of the surgeon's can show you how it works.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
