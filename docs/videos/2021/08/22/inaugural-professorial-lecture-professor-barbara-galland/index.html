While the mechanism(s) remain elusive, many hypotheses generated from her studies supported the adoption of safe sleep practices, that we now know are vital for protecting our little ones. That research enabled her to develop expertise in sleep health and sleep-related breathing disorders in children. She has advanced the field in several aspects of paediatric sleep measurement and built an evidence base around childhood snoring linked to learning deficits that support the arguments for early intervention. A growing demand for expertise in sleep research is matched by her multidisciplinary practice, currently with many University of Otago collaborators across Health Sciences and Sciences. Barbara greatly values these collaborations and her role in research. She has mentored more than 30 postgraduate students to complete their degrees.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be

barbara's promotion to<br>professor<br>it's good to see many of barbara's<br>colleagues and friends here but i'd like<br>to give a special welcome to barbara's<br>family<br>her husband alistair and her two<br>children brittany and roscoe have come<br>down from auckland to be with us<br>her<br>brother murray from dunedin<br>and i'd also like to welcome professor<br>dawn elder and associate professor<br>angela campbell from the university of<br>otago wellington it's lovely that you<br>so inaugural professorial lectures are<br>wonderful opportunities for us all to<br>take time out to learn about the<br>research that our outstanding colleagues<br>do<br>and also to hear about their journeys to<br>becoming a professor<br>and some of you have heard me say before<br>that promotion to professor at the<br>university of otago<br>internally is not easily achieved and<br>barbara has gone through a rigorous<br>process to demonstrate that she's worthy<br>of this promotion which you are and<br>a process that involves seeking feedback<br>from external referees across the world<br>and i've had the pleasure of reading<br>some of those referees comments<br>so barbara your referees talk of you are<br>being announced have having of having<br>outstanding contributions in the fields<br>of sudden unexpected death and infancy<br>and the impacts of sleep disorders on<br>children's health<br>in the area of sudden unexpected death<br>and infancy barbara's work has<br>contributed to evidence-based guidelines<br>that have resulted in a decrease in<br>death rates internationally<br>and barbara is also recognised as a<br>leading authority in pediatric sleep<br>research<br>so although barbara is a research<br>professor she's also actively<br>contributed to teaching in the<br>neuroscience and the medical programs<br>and<br>her colleagues talk about her being<br>highly knowledgeable professional and<br>approachable<br>and i also know from my daughter who has<br>was fortunate enough to work with<br>barbara for a short period that she also<br>does a great job of looking after her<br>team<br>so barbara congratulations on your<br>promotion<br>i'm really looking forward to your<br>lecture and i'd now like to invite<br>professor sue romanian to give you a<br>i'm robin subramaniam i'm the dean of<br>the otago medical school it gives me<br>distinct pleasure to introduce barbara<br>galland today for her inaugural<br>professorial lecture<br>barbara graduated from<br>the department of physiology and<br>university of otago with a<br>natural science first class honors<br>and then went on to do phd in the<br>department of pharmacology and completed<br>since 1989<br>she has remained<br>in the then department of pediatrics<br>which eventually became the department<br>of women and children's at the dunedin<br>school of medicine<br>she was a junior research fellow<br>research fellow senior research fellow<br>from 1989<br>to 2012<br>and in 2013 she was promoted to<br>associate research professor<br>eventually she was became a full<br>professor this year<br>barbara's research focus<br>is children's sleep health she has<br>published more than 120 articles<br>and presented more than<br>160<br>conference proceedings<br>she mentored more than 30 postgraduate<br>students<br>to complete her their postgraduate<br>degrees<br>she she served on<br>numerous numerous dunedin school of<br>medicine committees<br>health research council<br>as well as national science challenge<br>working party<br>and finally many editorial boards in the<br>field<br>it gives me<br>true pleasure<br>in congratulating barbara on behalf of<br>the otago medical school<br>its students<br>its staff<br>and alumni<br>congratulations barbara<br>let me introduce her talk she's going to<br>discuss<br>first her journey before she started her<br>research carrier<br>and then<br>follow on to discuss the importance of<br>child health in their sleep disorders<br>eventually she will focus on the future<br>perspective in this field<br>please kindly welcome<br>thank you very much for that lovely<br>introduction<br>greetings everybody<br>thank you for coming along today i<br>um<br>my background is<br>dunedin is where i live now i'd like to<br>acknowledge the manafenua of this region<br>naitahu<br>the<br>sinclair beach is my sea<br>that i'm most affiliated with and<br>first of all i just want to dedicate<br>this lecture to my mother gwitha gilland<br>who died about 12 days ago now<br>she was 95. she was going to be here<br>sorry she wasn't going to be here<br>because she was too frail<br>but she certainly told everybody about<br>it so she was certainly with it right to<br>the very end<br>so just a bit about my background so i<br>was um born third child to boyne and<br>gwithagaland<br>my father died in 1997. and this is my<br>grandmother nana who was a special<br>person in my life as well so these three<br>people very special and that's me and<br>you can see i still have trouble<br>so i was born in cheviot which is around<br>120 kms north of christchurch<br>as a baby<br>we shifted up to upper upper atia murray<br>my father was the headmaster of one of<br>the schools country schools up there<br>and i spent a lot of my early childhood<br>years there before we shifted south to<br>dunedin where dad started at um<br>was actually balaclava school it was<br>called bar street school so he started<br>right at the very beginning with that<br>then he went on to dni uh sorry<br>i had two older brothers who took great<br>care of me and one of them's here today<br>and the other one i think is on zoom<br>zooming in from napier<br>um this is in later years you can see<br>now that i'm the i'm i've got control in<br>this photo here and the first one<br>they're looking after me but that's<br>definitely um<br>things have turned around<br>i was married to alistair in 1992 and we<br>had two children brittany and roscoe who<br>are both here today they've come down<br>and this is them just this this year<br>both of them live in auckland and<br>they're both in the profession of law<br>even though both aleister and i i<br>was encouraged them to do science and<br>alistar discouraged them from doing law<br>and they both ended up doing laws so<br>in terms of my education so i started<br>out at operation school and i'm pretty<br>sure that that's my little my classroom<br>right here<br>um<br>and then we shifted south to waikeri<br>school and one of the um<br>things that one of the notable things<br>that happened there was when in my<br>career school my mother was quite taken<br>aback when we shifted from the country<br>through to a city my mother got a note<br>from the infant mistress to tell to say<br>that barbara needs to wear shoes to<br>school<br>so it was actually probably a really<br>idyllic life i think up in those early<br>days in in the country<br>i went to bell mcewen school then to<br>otago girls high school and to otago<br>polytechnic i did my new zealand<br>certificate in science and the polytech<br>was actually when i was i left school i<br>worked for six years as a technician<br>which is probably what is equivalent to<br>an assistant research fellow<br>um i'm sorry i'm more sorry a research<br>assistant these days<br>and i worked in the welcome institute<br>and in surgery department<br>then i went to university and i did a<br>bachelor of science and honours and<br>my<br>supervisor pat craig happens to be in<br>the academic party today so that's very<br>special<br>then i went on to pharmacology to do my<br>phd in pharmacology<br>under the supervision of<br>professor associate professor gary<br>blackman<br>in a study around e-waste reactivity and<br>a guinea pig model of asthma this was my<br>first publication and what was notable<br>about that was it was actually accepted<br>the first bounce it didn't come back and<br>researchers will understand that that's<br>phenomenal<br>it's never happened to me before and<br>it's probably never happened to many<br>other people i'm it was actually really<br>due to the meticulous nature of gary's<br>supervision anything that went submitted<br>was absolutely spot on<br>and so that was wonderful to have that<br>as my first publication<br>in 1989 i joined the department of<br>pediatrics as<br>what was department of pediatrics and<br>child health at that time<br>at the uh towards the end of the<br>1990s<br>we joined obstetrics and gynecology and<br>department of pediatrics and child<br>health joined to become the department<br>of women's and children's health and<br>this is a photo that some of you will<br>recognize that it was<br>held at glenn fallock we had a retreat<br>that was the beginning of the joining of<br>those departments it was a wonderful<br>time and you may recognize i think<br>there's a few people in the audience<br>so my research career has covered a lot<br>of disciplines and a lot of disorders<br>all of them under the banner of sleep<br>health<br>sleep health has really become a popular<br>term<br>since this article was published by<br>daniel busse from the university of<br>pittsburgh in 2014<br>really it's taken sleep which was really<br>very much focused on sleep medicine<br>and drugs and<br>sleep disorders turning it into a focus<br>really on<br>the disease state<br>you see in this diagram here<br>bringing it into sort of more population<br>health<br>looking at these two the parents and<br>this just need to get a bigger bed is<br>probably how they need to improve their<br>sleep health<br>but what's happened with this is that<br>actually sleep has become really really<br>popular and that's why i've got so many<br>disciplines so many conditions that we<br>study because it's a bit like<br>cardiovascular health it's actually it's<br>been framed like that and so dealing it<br>at a population level<br>everybody wants sleep these days<br>it used to be just nutrition and<br>activity and now sleep is the obviously<br>a really important pillar of health i<br>was always in the sleep field there's<br>not that many sleep researchers in um at<br>otago so it's actually we<br>and we're training a whole lot more so<br>but it's certainly been a very very busy<br>the um<br>article written by daniel busay was<br>actually updated it was more on adult<br>adult sleep and<br>lisa melzer from denver in colorado she<br>updated this um the child sleep health<br>and this article here pediatric sleep<br>health it matters and so does how to how<br>we define it<br>i was privileged to be asked to write<br>the editorial for that and i um<br>twisted the arm of my uh clinical<br>colleague dawn elder to help write that<br>so it was um that was just very recently<br>so just to begin with um<br>one of this ques question that was posed<br>to us by acc in a contract that we won<br>by tender was how much do children sleep<br>how often do they wake and for how long<br>seems a simple question but actually at<br>the time there were very few studies<br>that had actually answered this was a<br>longitudinal studies<br>there's some there was some attempt at<br>pulling<br>pulling the data together<br>but at the end of the day there was not<br>that information there and acc wanted<br>that information because they were<br>obviously helping a lot of families that<br>had children that needed that were<br>waking up a lot during during the night<br>and these were children with brain<br>injury at the time<br>so we published and this is actually<br>probably my biggest publication in terms<br>of contribution to the field of sleep<br>health<br>it was a meta-analysis so we've got lots<br>of metrics in that in that paper um so<br>it's really been used an awful lot in<br>the in the sleep health field<br>it was actually somebody for some reason<br>decided to go to stuff and actually um<br>find out how much we the contract was it<br>was ten thousand dollars and<br>um there was quite a a you know sort of<br>but at the end of the day it was a huge<br>amount of work and nobody had done it<br>and actually it's actually<br>acc allowed us to publish the data as<br>well and it's led to 542 citations so it<br>was a big<br>big contribution to this area of sleep<br>health and it is um<br>it is cited a lot in in the field<br>so now i'm just going to take you on my<br>journey research journey starting from<br>infants through the toddler preschool<br>child and teen sleep this is not<br>in chronological order at all but it's<br>just taking it through those different<br>so to begin with infant sleep<br>so my early research was in sudden<br>unexpected death in infancy sori is also<br>known as cot death or sids and some of<br>you may also know it as crib death<br>between 1979 and 1982 there were 3.8<br>deaths per thousand live births and this<br>is the graph of what happened<br>country-wide so you can see that in down<br>in dunedin and timaru invercargill we<br>had the highest rates at that time<br>the new zealand dare study that<br>many of you probably remember was<br>launched by<br>professor ed mitchell in auckland<br>and many<br>pediatricians and researchers across the<br>country in the different areas barry<br>taylor was involved here as well as<br>sheila williams<br>this study identified three main risk<br>factors and was really the first in the<br>world to actually identify particularly<br>that the prone sleep position was really<br>dangerous so sleeping on the tummy<br>as well as maternal smoking and not<br>because my background was in physiology<br>i<br>was involved in in the very early<br>studies in terms of looking actually<br>what might be going on with these babies<br>particularly the babies that were<br>sleeping on their tummy we follow the<br>hypotheses as what's called the triple<br>wrist model that sids may occur when<br>there's an intersection of the<br>vulnerable infant a critical<br>developmental period<br>and the outside stressor<br>so the babies that i've studied over my<br>time have been we've been looking at the<br>vulnerable infant in terms of sleeping<br>prone maternal smoking small for<br>gestational age methamphetamine i spent<br>a bit of time about three years going up<br>to auckland once a week on studies with<br>working with<br>professor ed mitchell<br>and babies who'd been exposed to<br>methamphetamine and utero<br>the critical developmental period was<br>around age we also<br>looked at critical times in terms of the<br>different sleep states whether they're<br>in dream sleep or in deep sleep<br>and the stresses that we were looking at<br>were really rebreathing their own<br>exhaled hair so the air so that the baby<br>lying prone is capable of actually<br>re-breathing and in their own own breath<br>and also excess beddy the ba the baby's<br>sleeping in the adult bed under those<br>heavy duvets and there was quite a focus<br>also on overheating at this time with<br>the many babies that were dying<br>this is the team<br>this is barry taylor<br>rachel<br>sayers he not look different now he's<br>not he's<br>he's not here<br>um rachel says um and angela campbell<br>who's here from wellington and this is<br>the late david bolton<br>he was from physiology department and he<br>was a great guy to have around and and<br>so in terms of rebreathing their own<br>exhaled hair this was um really started<br>with work that david bolton did and<br>actually was a summer student chris<br>creswell worked over the summer this<br>part this publication actually is cited<br>a lot but we started with a um a<br>mechanical model in terms of working out<br>how much carbon dioxide would accumulate<br>this was like an artificial lung<br>hydrated and we were able to work out<br>exactly what the re-breathe potential<br>might be of a baby sleeping face down<br>and<br>lots of different bedding surfaces we<br>did we did you know the long-haired<br>sheepskins and really flat you know hard<br>hard surfaces etc<br>leading to this publication that<br>re-breeding expired gases from beating a<br>cause of cot death<br>i was really surprised when i was<br>looking through google to actually<br>find that<br>baby manufacturers are still advertising<br>sheepskins so this is actually very very<br>recent looks like the baby's the child's<br>sleeping prone here<br>they're not for sleeping on i mean i'm<br>just just really amazed we had so many<br>babies that died sleeping on sheepskins<br>face down it's quite incredible that<br>they still advertise it they don't<br>actually advertise them for sleeping<br>often though you'll see a baby lying the<br>other way but this photograph i found<br>quite annoying<br>right so in terms of<br>studying how<br>babies might be influenced by this<br>rebreathing with david bolton's<br>experience and respiratory physiology<br>and this was actually part of angela's<br>um most of angela's phd in fact in this<br>in this field<br>um we had the baby sleeping in a cot<br>like here this is a perspective hood<br>over it and this just is a light cloth<br>that comes over this so we're able to<br>build up the gaseous environment just a<br>mild asphyxial stimulus to see what<br>would happen with the babies and what<br>they generally should do is actually<br>increase their breathing it's a<br>homeostatic protective response and wake<br>so we<br>use this re-breathe testing and testing<br>the babies when they are actually<br>sleeping<br>prone and supine and what we what we<br>found was that<br>um<br>most of the babies they increased their<br>breathing which we um sorry but the<br>protective response<br>um<br>sorry that's the other way around that<br>they had a poorer breathing response<br>when they were actually prone when they<br>were face down so that was compromised<br>but what was increased was actually<br>their waking so they were actually doing<br>exactly what we would expect them to do<br>if they had poor breathing that would<br>stimulate them to wake up<br>when we looked at maternal smoking there<br>was not much in that at all but there<br>was a small number of babies with poor<br>protective responses that actually<br>didn't respond<br>at all in terms of their breathing or<br>their waking in response to that<br>stimulus it was just a small number but<br>it was more than the babies from from<br>came from a non-smoking background if<br>you like<br>the other area of wrenches was actually<br>changing their blood pressure because<br>there is um hypotheses around babies<br>might just all of a sudden have to<br>respond to a drop in blood pressure<br>whether that's due to the fact that<br>they're overheated<br>um or getting a getting a fright type<br>thing when they're sleeping so um<br>the way to do that is actually tilt them<br>to an angle of 60 degrees quite quickly<br>bring where these pram the baby's<br>sitting in a jolly jumper bring them to<br>70 degrees quite quickly that drops<br>their blood pressure<br>and the protective response of that is<br>um that the blood vessels and and the<br>legs should constrict and the heart rate<br>should increase trying to get that blood<br>pressure back up to normal so that<br>compensatory response<br>what we found was with the prone sleep<br>position and again<br>versus the supine that the reflex<br>response to that was actually poorer in<br>both of those so that was probably one<br>of the most significant findings in the<br>field in terms of the cardiac reflexes<br>involved<br>so the findings did suggest that that<br>prone sleeping position suppresses<br>normal cardiac reflex responses<br>we're unable to of course go on and test<br>that but it's just pure hypotheses<br>around what might be going on that these<br>babies weren't responding as well when<br>they were in the prime sleep position<br>there was in 1990 the public health<br>campaign<br>some of you may remember this<br>with judy julie bailey judy bailey was<br>the mother of the nation<br>and she<br>did a lot of tv advertising particularly<br>promoting changing babies from sleeping<br>on their tummy to sleeping on their back<br>also the campaign was around promoting<br>breastfeeding and discouraging smoking<br>and you can see the figures here so<br>these are the deaths<br>up until 2000. so the number of deaths<br>per thousand live births<br>the campaign was in 1990 there was a<br>probably an awareness in the community<br>of what was going on all these babies<br>were dying and the new zealand cocktail<br>study had been well publicized and so<br>there's a drop even just before that<br>campaign and over time those drops<br>have come down we're still incredibly<br>high at point seven deaths per thousand<br>live bursts in terms of the most<br>up-to-date information that we've got on<br>there so there's about 40 to 50 babies<br>dying in new zealand still each year and<br>we still have the one of the highest<br>rates in the world<br>so this drop in um<br>in in suri was actually really<br>worked extremely well for pakiha because<br>we hit our babies<br>most of the babies were sleeping in<br>separate cots and it was easy just to<br>change that sleep position<br>it didn't resonate so much with maori<br>and pacific families who um bed sharing<br>is very much a part of their culture<br>the new zealand cot death study did<br>identify beer cheering it came a little<br>bit later in terms of being a high risk<br>factor when the infant was very young<br>but also when the bed sharing um was<br>associated with the mother<br>smoking so the messages were very much<br>like very much focused on if you're<br>sleeping with your baby and you're<br>you're a smoker<br>not to be<br>sharing the bed with your baby<br>in 1995<br>i<br>went on my sabbatical<br>with alistair and brittany at the time<br>she was two we went via a lab in<br>california to bristol to look at this<br>issue of bed sharing and set up some<br>studies around the bed sharing<br>physiology<br>i worked with professor peter fleming in<br>bristol and dr andrew cecchenko and<br>these are just some photos from the this<br>is the californian lab we didn't have a<br>computer at that that point this is the<br>old grass recorders that some of you may<br>recognize<br>and this is a this is mother latina<br>mother sleeping with her baby in the<br>setup around uh this is polysomnography<br>for sleep this is now the bristol lab we<br>were looking at uh we had the<br>um computerized system there and you can<br>see that's focused on a baby cot there<br>so monitoring remote monitoring this is<br>me setting up baby<br>um and this is the time in bristol there<br>was we went spent a lot of time watching<br>the balloons in bristol and the lovely<br>surrounds there<br>when i came back to dunedin we set up<br>the bed sharing studies and this was<br>with sally baddick<br>who's now professor at otago polytechnic<br>and she did her entire phd on this so<br>again we've got barry and the late david<br>bolton and myself this is at a<br>graduation ceremony this is at the time<br>when you had drinks after the graduation<br>ceremony it doesn't happen anymore<br>used to be a wonderful time actually<br>so and so there's a lot of the studies<br>there's a lot of the video studies so<br>the the babies were set up in the bed<br>and<br>a lot of her work was around describing<br>um the environment the the number of<br>there's a lot of really positive things<br>in terms of positive interaction with<br>the babies<br>promoting breastfeeding when they were<br>sleeping with their babies but there<br>were also some babies getting under the<br>bedding this is you know heavy duvets<br>and also the potential to re-breathe<br>they're<br>exhale<br>exhaled ears so a little bit like the<br>baby sleeping pro<br>prone into a sheepskin in terms of the<br>amount of gas that built up so she was<br>able to measure all of that<br>and described a lot of what the micro<br>environment around the bed hearing<br>situation<br>you can see in these photos here so this<br>is she studied about 40 cot sleeping<br>babies against 40 bed shearing babies<br>it's caught sleeping baby here and this<br>is getting completely under the bed<br>clothes here as well as the bed sharing<br>completely under bed clothes so it was<br>actually happening in both<br>both situations but<br>she certainly made a huge contribution<br>to the literature in terms of describing<br>bed sharing<br>from there<br>from from these studies and a lot of<br>work in the suri area safe sleep has<br>become the message<br>and within the maori community there was<br>the introduction of these the wahakura<br>so the flex baskets<br>and this is really not my story to tell<br>at all and it's really um professor<br>david tiffany leech who's<br>kindly lent me this photo and sally's<br>story in terms of the wahakura and and<br>for the whanau who use the wahakura so<br>this this provides a safe sleep place<br>the baby can sleep on the bed but<br>separate from them from the parents not<br>getting under the duvets<br>and these have certainly really been<br>welcomed amongst the maori community and<br>the pepe pods is another uh derivation<br>of this and some hospitals actually now<br>give out these little peppy pods<br>to um to<br>hire families that that want to sleep<br>with their baby in the bed but keeping<br>that separate separate space excuse me<br>so it would be remiss of me not to<br>actually um put up the messages around<br>safe sleep since this is a public<br>lecture<br>so this is nicely framed in terms of<br>pepe so the top four ways of preventing<br>suri so placing the baby in his own bed<br>and<br>baby bed and the same room as the parent<br>of caregiver eliminating smoking and<br>pregnancy and also<br>smoking in the home and smoking in the<br>car as well which is um you know we<br>always<br>used to<br>know in smoking days you know didn't<br>really think about the car but it's a<br>really close environment<br>positioning baby flat on their back to<br>sleep face of clear keeping that face<br>clear is paramount<br>encouraging and supporting exclusive<br>breastfeeding and gentle handling of<br>baby<br>so the mechanisms for city still remain<br>elusive despite all our work we've<br>written up a lot of reviews on on this<br>topic<br>and i was delighted to be able to do a<br>book chapter recently um was invited to<br>do this but this time i twisted dawn's<br>arm to actually take the lead on this so<br>there was another publication from dora<br>myself that just came out this year in<br>another study in infants that i just<br>want to talk about this is really<br>belongs to professor rachel taylor and<br>barry taylor who are pis on this<br>particular project<br>um but i'm certainly had a huge<br>involvement in terms of the sleep side<br>of things<br>this is a prevention of overweight and<br>infancy the poi study<br>we focused on food activity and<br>breastfeeding and sleep so the rationale<br>for sleep is that short sleep or poor<br>quality sleep is linked to high risk of<br>overweight and obesity in childhood<br>it seems natural to focus on food and<br>activity and breastfeeding as as a<br>preventative thing in infancy but the<br>sleep was actually a really new part of<br>all of that<br>so in this study there were 802 pregnant<br>women randomized to one of four groups<br>for a two-year intervention and there's<br>four arms here so we've got the food and<br>activity the sleep<br>um then we combine that as well and and<br>a control group<br>and what this study showed was that the<br>risk of infants falling into the obese<br>category<br>actually halved in those who received<br>the sleep intervention at two years it<br>was quite a surprising finding this was<br>exploratory data<br>around the sleep<br>side of things<br>there's another study in the united<br>states that also showed a similar thing<br>so it was really it was quite intriguing<br>we still don't actually know the<br>mechanism for it<br>but this is the data on the standardized<br>bmi z score up to two years now we<br>followed them up at three and a half<br>years and there's still a difference in<br>the bmi z scores at three and a half in<br>five years<br>we are just studying them now at 11<br>years of age so i guess it's a watch<br>this space to see what happens if it can<br>be sustained at all<br>it was just a really mild intervention<br>the<br>intervention happened<br>antenatally so we were<br>giving sleep education to parents<br>mothers and fathers<br>before the baby was born and then um<br>three weeks and and then up to six<br>months and some children got an<br>intervention for problematic sleep um<br>but basically it was considered a very<br>mild one but it obviously had some<br>effect on on terms of<br>the parenting and and the weight<br>so that's yeah just to watch the space<br>for this and i guess probably in a<br>couple of years time we might have the<br>data from that or in a year's time<br>so just moving on to toddler sleep now<br>this age group presents particular<br>challenges so bedtime resistance<br>stalling and calling out<br>i was a calling out i definitely was a<br>calling out i mean always calling out to<br>my dad i want another drink of water<br>you might have your own little stories<br>night wakings um the parent actually<br>having to be there while the<br>um they<br>child toddler falls asleep nighttime<br>fears and nightmares<br>sleep walking in and sleep<br>tears peak in this preschool age group<br>one of our studies that we did some<br>qualitative research was actually<br>interviewing mothers about problematic<br>sleep and there really was not much in<br>the literature about this at all and<br>this quote here from one of the mothers<br>kind of sums it all up saying i'm way<br>more cranky and less tolerant and need<br>less and need more nurturing rather than<br>feeling i've got heaps of resources to<br>just shout i can certainly relate to<br>that um with one of my children at that<br>time<br>um<br>uh so<br>so the impact on children's problematic<br>sleep um was really um framed in terms<br>of the emotional responses so mother's<br>even feeling guilty about it shame<br>confusion frustration and defeat<br>and then the impact on daytime<br>functioning exhaustion moodiness poor<br>concentration it's a really difficult<br>time the top the toddler sleep period<br>a kiss a consistent bedtime routine does<br>appear to help with many preschooler<br>problems sleep problems<br>but i do acknowledge that's a very<br>westernized view and it's not<br>necessarily doesn't necessarily resonate<br>with all families when routine is not<br>something that<br>can happen within with a number of<br>families<br>but if we're looking at pre-sleep<br>routines we really don't know what the<br>routines are and very very difficult to<br>measure so we have this preschool cam<br>study underway with one of my<br>phd students who's also a pediatrician<br>dr lauren miller<br>and we are studying these babies at um<br>sorry babies i've got the wrong group<br>the toddlers um they're wearing a gopros<br>here so we can actually get this point<br>of view<br>information from video in terms of what<br>they're doing and we code for that and<br>can describe<br>um the the pre-bedtime practices and<br>then linking that with what happens with<br>their sleep as well so we measure their<br>sleep uh quite a bit with wrist watches<br>so we measure that objectively so<br>the pilot studies have been done for<br>this and we're about to launch the full<br>studies of this so it's actually it's<br>quite intense of intensive work but it's<br>going to yield a lot of<br>really valuable information for this<br>around this age group another difficulty<br>with<br>this age group is sleep disorder<br>breathing and just for the purposes of<br>this lecture i'm going to call it<br>snoring it is on a spectrum from just<br>simple snoring right up to where the<br>airways are obstructed with obstructive<br>sleep apnea<br>so<br>you can see the prevalence in this data<br>here at three and a half years it<br>increases and then it falls off it falls<br>off quite a bit right up to about eight<br>nine years of age that's because the<br>main reason for obstruction is the<br>tonsils and or the adenoids<br>and as the child grows the airways<br>become bigger in relation to these<br>structures so by eight or nine years of<br>age it can just resolve naturally you<br>can see it even dropping off as<br>as the children age here one of the<br>um<br>symptoms is mouth breathing<br>and<br>you can see this<br>little boy here who's actually my one of<br>did have his ad noise out and it was all<br>resolved but the mouth breathing is very<br>much a part of all of that and he was<br>obviously overheating too at the time<br>when he was having that sleep and and<br>that's you know it's another feature too<br>they're putting a lot of work into their<br>breathing um<br>while he's sleeping<br>so now i'm going to morph a little bit<br>from the toddler uh preschooler into the<br>child's sleep as well<br>so a lot of our studies have focused on<br>this snoring so<br>in this particular study we wanted to<br>know actually what happens over four<br>years and this was a survey of 459<br>parents that we were able to study it<br>at both three and seven years of age in<br>that uh group 13<br>of them were snorers and over time what<br>happens was that um<br>57 of those were still snoring by age 7<br>and 45 43 had actually stopped snoring<br>only four percent were actually treated<br>and the others just naturally resolved i<br>said those airways growing with that<br>we take the um the what happens to the<br>non-snorers the majority remain as<br>non-snorers but there are a few that<br>actually do start snoring over those<br>intervening four years<br>so what happens when snoring is treated<br>this particular publication was one of<br>probably about four or five<br>right at the beginning of the interest<br>in<br>behaviour and attention in children<br>linked to snoring<br>and in this particular study where it<br>was a before after treatment study<br>children aged 4 to 11 years<br>they were going through having their<br>adenoids and tonsils out we measured<br>behavior via parent report and attention<br>to tasks during doing one-to-one<br>assessments and both of these things<br>improved following treatment<br>now there's been many many studies since<br>and randomized control studies too which<br>are kind of the highest level of<br>evidence that actually<br>that actually confirm these particular<br>study findings<br>why is that the potential reason is<br>probably<br>there's some fmri studies around this as<br>well the breathing pauses they lower the<br>blood oxygen levels there's lots of<br>waking and destruct disruption to the<br>sleep structure and it's believed that<br>the frontal lobe is actually<br>preferentially affected by this and you<br>have all of these problems with behavior<br>and attention to task coming through<br>with it<br>so we've studied<br>pretty much<br>all of these areas in the course of our<br>work with snoring but one of the areas<br>that has really received the least<br>attention is learning<br>so<br>myself<br>working with libby shaunicy who's our<br>expert in the academic performance side<br>have set up a lot of studies in this<br>one of the<br>things that we did was actually<br>pull the data together from the<br>literature in terms of snoring and<br>academic performance and combining that<br>public data on what we call a<br>meta-analysis<br>pulling all of that information together<br>practical interpretation was from that<br>data was that you take in snorers and<br>the non-snorers and all these this is<br>language arts is actually reading<br>writing and um i can't remember the<br>third one um reading writing and yeah<br>and<br>math and and science the practical<br>interpretation was um spelling that was<br>a um practical interpretation was that<br>the um<br>the snorers uh were<br>were actually performing about 12<br>below if you took any kind of grade<br>average any type of report with that so<br>really confirming that<br>that there is some link between<br>snoring and academic outcomes most of<br>that evidence was from cross-sectional<br>studies so that's at one point in time<br>we wanted to know what happened over<br>time<br>and this was set up was the beer study<br>breathing education and readiness for<br>school study now in this study we had 85<br>controls and 85 snores each one of them<br>was matched by age 6 deep index<br>and the bmi status and we've studied<br>these this group we had about over 90<br>retention up to 80 years of age we<br>studied the cognitive development their<br>behavior<br>and these one-to-one assessments with<br>numeracy and literacy<br>i've just been up just summarize the key<br>findings here there was an awful lot of<br>publications that came out of this<br>because there were lots of sidearms of<br>information that we published on the way<br>but the main ones really that the<br>children with a snoring history at age<br>three<br>um<br>when they turned age eight they did have<br>poor performance on some of the literacy<br>skills and some of the numeracy skills<br>if their<br>snoring was treated their reading was on<br>par with their peers but they did still<br>have lower performance in some of these<br>measures of academic performance<br>the math side of things was actually<br>completely unaffected so it was more<br>around the reading<br>and and some of these listening skills<br>the findings from the study really<br>highlight the importance of treating<br>early to optimize a child's learning<br>so what happens with academic<br>performance after treatment so that's<br>after treatment with adenotonsillectomy<br>we have with sarah mason one of our phd<br>students she conducted a pilot study of<br>20 cases matched to 20 controls they<br>have to be tightly matched in terms of<br>the age and their sex we tried as much<br>as possible with the instructional group<br>in their bmi status and just being a<br>pilot i've just put the<br>main uh this key results here<br>there was nothing in the numeracy but<br>with the literacy again we found that<br>and this is pulled data from two<br>measures before treatment baseline<br>before treatment<br>and then the percentage growth so<br>children's learning obviously is growing<br>all the time so really looking at the<br>trajectories of these and these are our<br>preschoolers<br>showing the trajectories of these<br>one-to-one assessments with literacy<br>skills and the cases showing more growth<br>in that just a small number of those<br>this was just in the preschoolers the<br>school-aged children we didn't pick up<br>anything at all<br>but one of the rcts so they're the ones<br>that actually again i said the highest<br>level of evidence there are<br>at least two randomized controlled<br>trials studied<br>done throughout the world one in the<br>united states and one in australia they<br>have to be multi-center trials um they<br>take a take a long time a huge amount of<br>money involved with that the two trials<br>that have been published actually have<br>did not really focus on literacy they<br>showed all of those changes with<br>behavior and attention there were some<br>school factors that the parents that the<br>teachers were reporting that were showed<br>that was some improvement in that<br>with our particular studies we um<br>with libby's work we use measures that<br>are quite sensitive to<br>to um treatment effects and so we can<br>study these learning over a short period<br>of time most of the other measures are<br>actually much more global things around<br>parent report of education etc so we're<br>in a nice position to be able to study<br>these these more sensitive measures we<br>did it one stage try and go for a trial<br>with hrc but we didn't get anywhere with<br>the feasibility but i think if anything<br>i think this particular area<br>is really interesting and there's<br>certainly some very early studies that<br>showed<br>some<br>gains in this<br>academic side<br>so<br>in terms of looking at those with low<br>other studies had actually shown that<br>the prevalence of snoring in children<br>that actually struggling academically is<br>high and so you can see what would<br>happen there for the treatment of that<br>these might actually be the target<br>ones to treat<br>in 2015<br>we had national standards at that time<br>where the teachers rated whether the<br>child in their class was above at below<br>or well<br>below<br>their peers in terms of performance with<br>reading maths and writing and these were<br>the levels uh 22<br>below or well below par<br>in 2015 for reading etc<br>so using that information we uh<br>conducted a large survey called the<br>study was called the sea lion study then<br>um sleep in early learning in our<br>neighborhood in a thousand one thousand<br>six hundred and twenty two aged six to<br>ten years six to ten years<br>we were looking to see if the in new<br>zealand the prevalence of snoring is<br>higher in those struggling academically<br>or not<br>they're not<br>at the odds of poor school performance<br>using those categories but this was<br>actually parent report<br>showed that<br>one point there was a 1.9 fold increase<br>in those for reading<br>writing and math so those struggling<br>academically<br>were<br>a lot of those with sleep disorder<br>breathing were at increased risk of poor<br>academic performance in those particular<br>measures<br>the importance is this is that these<br>children may benefit most from most from<br>tree treatment so they may be the target<br>ones in terms of the clinicians looking<br>at<br>um you know who should who would benefit<br>most<br>but certainly there's a lot to do around<br>that area but<br>the other side of it is that um the<br>treatment is not uh not cheap of course<br>it's it's and it's not without its risk<br>so i just want to acknowledge the<br>researchers on on that study so we had<br>um<br>we had four<br>phds go through with that particular<br>study there<br>it's a different species there are<br>the main feature is that unlike this<br>cartoon here they actually do become<br>increasingly nocturnal<br>there is a different biology driving<br>this sleep melatonin is one of our<br>hormones that actually<br>regulates the timing of our sleep and<br>this black one here is typical of<br>a child<br>or even an adult just shifted slightly<br>but with um adolescence by the time they<br>reach puberty it all shifts so that<br>their timing of sleep they prefer to go<br>to sleep later shifts along also they<br>prefer to wake up later in the morning<br>of course they have to go after school<br>in the morning same time as everybody<br>else so their sleep duration is<br>shortened there's also a reduced drive<br>for them to sleep as well as there's two<br>areas of biology that are that are<br>affected<br>so asking a teenager to wake up at seven<br>in the morning every day of the week is<br>like asking an adult to wake up at four<br>o'clock in the morning if you've had<br>teenagers or got teenagers yourself you<br>might might be able to<br>connect with that or they wake up if<br>they do wake up they're super cranky<br>sometimes<br>we've in the adolescent field we've<br>published a handful of studies<br>it's becoming more of my interest now<br>than it was in earlier days in earlier<br>days it was actually really difficult to<br>recruit adolescents for um for studies<br>but we've started paying them more and<br>we find them that they start flocking<br>um<br>one of the studies that probably is used<br>the most is this very first one here<br>where we actually did uh<br>do a survey and finding out about<br>adolescent sleep it's been very very few<br>surveys done over the years<br>um in in new zealand um<br>and so this one uh what we've done here<br>is actually use the recommended hours of<br>sleep for an adolescent is eight to ten<br>hours seven might be okay and out to 11<br>might be okay<br>working out the prevalence of poor sleep<br>in these children and<br>what it equated to that there was only<br>uh<br>38<br>plus 12 whatever that is i could work<br>that out um<br>we're actually um<br>in the recommended hours but<br>you know some of these 10<br>14 15 16 were actually sleeping below<br>those hours and 31.7<br>less than seven hours of sleep a night<br>mean sleep duration was the eight hours<br>which is at the lower end of the<br>recommended<br>34 were taking a long time to go to<br>sleep and 50<br>said they had poor sleep quality<br>and that was actually stronger in<br>females than males<br>so there are myriad uh adverse<br>consequences of poor sleep and i've just<br>noted uh<br>important ones around here car accidents<br>poor school performance etc um the<br>obesity link and then this poorest<br>psychological health<br>and mental health around that so this is<br>a really big area in terms of the risks<br>of<br>children being sleep deprived<br>adolescents being sleep deprived risk<br>taking in substance abuse there's an<br>awful lot of literature linking all of<br>these things<br>strategies to intervene<br>can be around establishing a bedtime<br>routine<br>addressing exposure to light so taking<br>you know<br>screens and things off the trials in<br>that area haven't actually been that<br>successful<br>individual sleep education programs<br>we've done some work in that area<br>cognitive behavioral therapy and later<br>school start time so later school start<br>times is the one that i'm really<br>interested in the moment and we're<br>actually setting up a program of<br>research on this so really this<br>addresses<br>the<br>this clash of strong forces where the<br>teenager wants to stay up late into the<br>evening but the school start times<br>actually put a break on that there's<br>only one school in new zealand that<br>actually has taken note of this and<br>that's wellington high school they've<br>had later school start time since 2016<br>and they still have that today so the<br>senior students start at 10 30 in the<br>morning<br>and<br>there are some schools starting to do<br>one day a week like that now that does<br>set up a bit of a variable sleep pattern<br>but really<br>it really builds on recommendations from<br>the american caddy academy of pediatrics<br>but in america a lot of the schools<br>start at 7 30 in the morning now they've<br>just shifted in california they've<br>passed a law that no schools can start<br>before at 8 30 in the morning<br>so we're actually we're way ahead of the<br>use because none of our schools start<br>before 8 30 but many of our kids are<br>still sleep deprived so still a lot of<br>work to do around this area and actually<br>next month we're going up to wellington<br>high school we're doing a lot of work in<br>terms of measuring these children's<br>sleep and measuring their mental<br>well-being as well and comparing that to<br>other schools that don't have um<br>that have the normal school start time<br>so i think it's really a really<br>interesting area and i'd really like to<br>get some traction on this it's um but<br>there's an awful lot to consider because<br>you know changing school start times<br>affects whole communities and and<br>families<br>so just a little bit to finish off in<br>terms of the adolescent side of things<br>so we have um a whole program of<br>research around wearable cameras looking<br>at pre-bedtime activities and in sneaky<br>bedtime<br>screen screen use with cameras these are<br>still cameras here that measure<br>capture photos every five seconds or so<br>wearable video cameras and also the<br>stationary video camera here as well<br>um and this is a sample of the sort of<br>data that we're collecting um you can<br>see with our just still photos we're<br>picking up you know food and then what<br>happens at the end of it if these are<br>taken every few seconds we get a huge<br>amount of data there's also a huge<br>amount of coding and i take my head off<br>to all the people who are doing all the<br>coding with us it's it's really<br>intensive work but really um really<br>really rich data that we're getting from<br>this and this is uh from one of one of<br>our studies<br>um this is the video information there's<br>a teenager um the sort of things that<br>they're doing and you know with these<br>cameras on front so you know they're<br>playing all these video games<br>chess i know that one<br>um<br>you know reading comics so you get this<br>really really rich information you can<br>link to that there's that likes they're<br>hitting likes likes all the time<br>i can't see any names on there thank<br>goodness<br>okay so there's a lot of work going on<br>in that area we did and and you know<br>over time be able to sorry read some<br>more results around this so i just want<br>to finish up a little bit on um<br>just<br>making the point that getting to<br>professor level is not just about the<br>research i'm obviously a research<br>professor but<br>service is a huge part of my of my work<br>and not just the internal service but um<br>serving on these boards the australian<br>sleep association and um<br>editing for journals so i'm actually an<br>editor on a couple of these journals<br>here um<br>frontiers in psychiatry actually needed<br>for the sleep disorder part of part of<br>all of that so an awful lot of stuff<br>work has to be done on service<br>teaching<br>so these<br>i do teach in the neuroscience program i<br>teach also<br>case group tutorials so these are my<br>lovely students and and that i enjoy<br>meeting every week and you see this is<br>my teaching time because it was at<br>5 49 last thursday so we're having a<br>teaching tomorrow instead i do a little<br>bit in the fifth year as well on on<br>sleep in in surrey as well<br>so i just want to acknowledge my main<br>collaborators<br>elizabeth shaunicy we've had a great<br>collaboration for years and it's been<br>wonderful<br>with her expertise and<br>academic<br>learning side of things and mine on<br>sleep and then also associate professor<br>patrick dawes who's the ent surgeon on<br>all of these studies really value his<br>contribution<br>to these studies as well<br>prof barry taylor of course he um<br>very much early on with the city um he's<br>provided a lot of opportunities for me<br>and i thank him enormously he's away at<br>a conference at the moment<br>um the late david bolton i mean he was<br>just marvelous to have he was really<br>really intellectual um<br>uh respiratory physiologist and we miss<br>him dearly<br>professor rachel taylor i've really<br>enjoyed the collaboration with her i<br>started collaborating with rachel<br>probably quite later in the piece really<br>when that poised study started with<br>those infants and they're overweight and<br>obesity but we have a huge collaboration<br>a lot of this work particularly the<br>adolescent sleep<br>with those cameras is actually<br>is very much a lot of rachel's work as<br>well so i look forward to a few more<br>years of that collaboration<br>um and of course our biostats people<br>are always part of this<br>um of the research and i acknowledge<br>sheila williams andrew gray and dr jill<br>hazard on the bi-state side just another<br>collaboration that i haven't even had<br>time to mention but i really i work a<br>lot with<br>associate professor ben wheeler who's<br>also away at a conference at the moment<br>and all of these lovely people and type<br>1 diabetes are the new technology that's<br>been used for glucose control so we're<br>doing a lot around sleep in the children<br>and the parents with the advances in<br>technology there so i really acknowledge<br>and valuable<br>uh value that collaboration<br>uh just finally uh<br>children and their fine are involved in<br>this research first and foremost many<br>ras and arfs<br>and staff of women's and children's<br>health and dsm the many postgraduate<br>students and i've just listed the ones<br>that at the moment but there's an awful<br>lot that have gone before these people<br>the funding<br>i'm sure i've missed some off there but<br>a lot of different funders particularly<br>the university of otago research grants<br>i always say that i'm the champion of<br>small grants rather than the big grants<br>and they've certainly provided a lot of<br>funding finally thank you all for<br>i'm mike steigle i'm the head of<br>department of women's and children's<br>health and i'm fortunate enough to have<br>professor glenn in my department and uh<br>um<br>i'm honored to to thank her for giving<br>this this excellent lecture this evening<br>and<br>quite a bit of insight into the<br>importance of this research and research<br>that a lot of us don't really think much<br>about is pediatric and child and<br>adolescent sleep<br>but the impact this research has saved<br>lives the impact internationally<br>of<br>professor glenn's work has saved<br>countless lives and it's not just in new<br>zealand but around the world and if you<br>think about<br>many of us doing research<br>how much of it has that much of an<br>impact and saves that many lives<br>i don't mind doesn't<br>so i think that's an incredible<br>accomplishment and and looking at the<br>impact on<br>the other age groups with sleep health<br>the mental health and the effects on<br>teaching and learning for<br>uh<br>for our children and our adolescents the<br>impact of this research over her career<br>has been remarkable she's dedicated um<br>her career to<br>to this field and has really had an<br>incredible impact not just in new<br>zealand but internationally and she's<br>not slowing down as she showed in the<br>later slides using technology and and i<br>know when you take these photos every<br>five seconds and you take this video you<br>end up with<br>countless amount of<br>data that someone has to unt so she and<br>her group are working at contextualizing<br>this culturally as well as to what does<br>this mean for different cultures and<br>this will be impactful around the world<br>as sleep researchers look at<br>um the future using technology and what<br>does all this data mean and unteasing it<br>and improving the health of our children<br>and adolescents<br>um<br>and the one thing that<br>barbara mentioned it toward the<br>end end of her talk<br>as outstanding of a researcher she is<br>she's an even better postgraduate<br>supervisor i think she is without
