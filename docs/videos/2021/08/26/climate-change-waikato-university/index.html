lane i'm an<br>atmospheric chemist and the deputy dean<br>here at tiakama tuatua school of science<br>at the university of wakato today i'm<br>going to talk to you a little bit about<br>climate change and our brand new<br>bachelor of climate change degree<br>so at the heart of climate change is the<br>greenhouse effect<br>sunshine comes down to the earth<br>and is absorbed by the earth now some of<br>that energy gets re-irradiated back into<br>space as heat<br>and that heat is able to be absorbed by<br>some of the molecules that are present<br>in earth's atmosphere we call these<br>molecules so-called greenhouse gases<br>and these are things like carbon dioxide<br>methane nitrous oxide and so on<br>now over the past 150 years or so the<br>concentration of these greenhouse gases<br>has significantly increased in earth's<br>atmosphere this is mostly due to the<br>combustion of fossil fuels to produce<br>electricity to drive our cars to produce<br>different products and so forth<br>and so as the concentration of those<br>greenhouse gases has increased so too<br>has the temperature of the earth because<br>more energy is being trapped and held in<br>into the<br>atmosphere now a lot of you will have a<br>pretty simple idea of climate change in<br>your mind like this and i want to<br>convince you firstly today that climate<br>change is so much more than just global<br>warming<br>firstly when we think about global<br>warming the word global implies that we<br>have an equal effect that is occurring<br>everywhere around the earth and that<br>everybody's kind of contributing to the<br>problem globally as well<br>and that's not really not the case we<br>know that some parts of the world are<br>experiencing warming that's up to twice<br>as fast as other parts of the world<br>particularly in<br>like the arctic region and we also know<br>that in parts of say<br>pacific island neighbors some of those<br>regions where they're very low-lying<br>countries that they're going to<br>experience the effects of climate change<br>much more readily than other parts of<br>the world that live in higher uh<br>altitudes and so this this raises some<br>interesting and important social justice<br>questions about<br>emissions that are coming from countries<br>that are relatively low but they're<br>going to experience a disproportionate<br>effect from climate change<br>now with climate change as the<br>temperature of the earth increases the<br>rate of evaporation for water into the<br>atmosphere increases as well so this<br>means that our atmosphere holds onto<br>more water and you may have heard of the<br>old adage of what comes up goes up must<br>come down and that's certainly true when<br>we think of weather as well so as more<br>water enters into the atmosphere that<br>means there is more water available to<br>fall down to the atmosphere and so as<br>the climate changes as as the<br>temperature increases we expect to see<br>more extreme weather events and more<br>frequent extreme weather events<br>now that has a knock-on effect into our<br>entire financial sector<br>things like insurance are fundamentally<br>about taking a bet as to whether a<br>certain activity is going to take place<br>and so as we have increased<br>extreme weather events our insurance<br>premiums are going to rise and that has<br>a cascading effect into mortgages and<br>lending and our entire financial sector<br>climate change is also significantly<br>affecting our ability to produce food<br>from regions of the world where they're<br>receiving too much rain and that's<br>causing flooding and other damage and<br>challenges for for crops and for animals<br>we also have regions of the world that<br>will be experiencing extreme dry<br>conditions because the changing wetter<br>weather patterns means that less<br>rainfall is going to fall in those<br>spaces<br>some key crops things like cherries<br>require a certain number of frost days<br>for fruiting to be really bountiful and<br>so as the climate changes different<br>crops are going to be able to be grown<br>into different regions<br>the increasing concentration of carbon<br>dioxide in the atmosphere also means<br>that there'll be more carbon dioxide<br>that is driven into and absorbed by the<br>oceans<br>now as the oceans absorb carbon dioxide<br>it causes them to become more acidified<br>the ph lowers and this is really<br>challenging for small mourinho<br>organisms<br>things like plankton and also larval<br>stages of<br>shellfish and other species are causing<br>a knock on effect through our entire<br>marine ecosystem threatening our<br>aquaculture and our fisheries industries<br>so from this quick description you might<br>be starting to get a impression that<br>climate change is really complex and<br>that's certainly true it affects all of<br>the different facets of the world around<br>us<br>but the solution to climate change is<br>incredibly simple<br>we need to reduce our greenhouse gas<br>emissions there is no other option<br>when people talk to you about different<br>approaches<br>to battling climate change what they are<br>talking about are either band-aid<br>solutions where we attempt to deal with<br>a symptom rather than the underlying<br>cause<br>or attempts to somehow have our cake and<br>eat it too<br>or some sort of a rational discounting<br>of the future pretending that the<br>current situation is actually quite fine<br>but it's really not<br>um there's this quote from elon musk<br>back from 2013<br>that i really think beautifully<br>summarizes the situation so musk says<br>well we're running the most dangerous<br>experiment in history right now which is<br>to see how much carbon dioxide the<br>atmosphere can handle before there is an<br>environmental catastrophe<br>and you might be thinking well hey this<br>is elon musk he's the ceo of tesla he's<br>trying to convince people to buy more<br>electric vehicles so that he can make<br>more money<br>this is just some sort of environmental<br>grandstanding but it's really it's<br>really not<br>and i think<br>one figure does a great job of trying to<br>explain just how<br>varied and how changed our current<br>climate really is<br>um this is a plot that shows the<br>concentration of carbon dioxide that's<br>been in earth's atmosphere over the past<br>800 000 years or so and this is data<br>that has been collected from an ice core<br>in antarctica about 3.1 kilometers worth<br>of ice where there are tiny air bubbles<br>that are captured and trapped and within<br>those we can look at the composition of<br>the air<br>what we see is that the concentration of<br>co2 in earth's atmosphere has gone up<br>and down up and down up and down<br>from about 180 parts per million to say<br>280 parts per million so up and down up<br>and down now this natural process is a<br>very well known uh is a very well known<br>phenomena<br>and if you think back to the greenhouse<br>effects that i talked about at the<br>beginning of this little session<br>this is because the earth doesn't quite<br>go around the sun in a perfect circle<br>there are times where we get a little<br>bit closer to the sun and a little bit<br>further away from the sun which causes<br>the temperature of the earth to increase<br>a little bit and to decrease a little<br>bit and this is principally what we see<br>in this data when the earth gets a<br>little bit warmer the oceans warm up and<br>they release carbon dioxide into the<br>atmosphere and we see a spike in co2 and<br>when the earth gets a little bit colder<br>the co2 then gets reabsorbed back into<br>the oceans now this happens over a very<br>long time period hundreds of thousands<br>of years but we have this up and down up<br>and down cycle and when you look across<br>close to the present day you can see<br>that the concentration of co2 was going<br>up and up and up and then if you look at<br>this previous pattern you might<br>reasonably expect it to start to drop<br>back down again okay and that is what<br>should be happening right now we are<br>getting a little bit further away from<br>the sun on average and so the earth<br>should be getting a little bit cooler<br>and so the concentration of co2 should<br>be decreasing<br>but it's not<br>we have managed to massively overcome<br>that natural cycle such that the<br>concentration of co2 is over 408 parts<br>per million now<br>well over the value that it has ever<br>been<br>in the last 800 000 years or so so we<br>now i said to you that<br>the solution to climate change was<br>simple and that's certainly true but we<br>shouldn't confuse something that is<br>simple with something that is easy to do<br>and this is fundamentally why i believe<br>that we haven't seen large change in<br>society's behavior to combat or address<br>concerns around climate change<br>now you might be starting to despair and<br>you might be starting to think well what<br>on earth can i do this problem looks<br>pretty big<br>we keep seeing ipcc reports coming out<br>telling us that the climate is getting<br>warmer and warmer and that we have less<br>and less time to do something so what<br>can you do<br>i want to suggest there are three things<br>that you can do as an individual<br>firstly develop your own understanding<br>of climate change science<br>the science isn't actually particularly<br>complicated in terms of understanding<br>the general effects of climate change<br>and global warming so get a good<br>understanding of climate change science<br>and then with that good understanding of<br>climate change science you can start to<br>make good personal choices to reduce<br>your own emissions right opt for the low<br>carbon option when you're purchasing a<br>product or choosing to travel or<br>choosing to move around<br>the world the third thing you can do is<br>to expand your circle of influence so<br>it's not just about changes that you can<br>make for your personal emissions but<br>that you can join the workforce of<br>tomorrow as a climate informed employee<br>and you can start<br>advocating and making decisions uh for<br>your organization that you work in and<br>how they can chose to reduce their<br>greenhouse gas emissions<br>now to prepare you for the workforce of<br>the tomorrow we have created our brand<br>new bachelor of climate change degree<br>and this is what we believe is the next<br>step in what is necessary to see real<br>change in society to take up the<br>challenge<br>that climate change presents for us<br>so this bachelor of climate change it's<br>a world first it is only available here<br>at the university of wakato and what it<br>does crucially is it allows you to study<br>to become an expert in a wide range of<br>different subjects that are necessary as<br>we attempt to develop solutions to<br>climate change so you'll become an<br>expert in one of a range of different<br>specific existing subjects that are<br>relevant and necessary for climate<br>change you will also develop a very<br>broad understanding of climate change<br>across its different scientific social<br>cultural and economic dimensions<br>lastly the bachelor of climate change<br>degree from a design point of view<br>incorporates matsuranga maori throughout<br>the degree structure<br>and you will learn how people exist as a<br>part of the natural world and not<br>separated from it<br>there is a fantastic maori wakatoki here<br>oranga<br>which in short says you know when the<br>world when our environment is well it is<br>healthy uh that is also a scenario that<br>people will be well people will be<br>healthy<br>so the bachelor of climate change degree<br>is like any bachelor's program here in<br>altera new zealand it's a three-year<br>program and here at the university of<br>wakuto you will take eight different<br>courses in each of those three years of<br>the degree and those are represented by<br>the 24 white boxes that are in front of<br>you<br>now through the core of the degree are<br>these grey papers and this is where you<br>will develop that really broad and<br>holistic understanding of what climate<br>change is<br>you will learn about the scientific<br>aspects you'll learn about how arts and<br>activism is related you will discover<br>how<br>climate change impacts and affects maori<br>and indigenous peoples<br>to a disproportionate effect in many<br>cases<br>you'll understand how the climate is<br>going to change and how we can adapt to<br>some of those uh<br>impacts<br>and then lastly you'll learn in terms of<br>how we can try to address climate change<br>what mitigation strategies are in place<br>you can then uh select one of as i said<br>a wide range of different majors these<br>are represented by the yellow boxes that<br>you can see here on the screen<br>and this<br>is the selection of majors that are<br>available for our bachelor of climate<br>change now these are um there are some<br>majors that you would expect things like<br>ecology and earth scientist earth<br>science but there are also things like<br>economics<br>there's philosophy there's public<br>relations sociology strategic management<br>and this is because we need people<br>throughout the workforce in many<br>different sectors of society who are<br>both fantastic economists but they also<br>understand climate change or they're<br>fantastic in political science but they<br>also understand uh climate change<br>lastly with the degree you have seven<br>elective slots where you can choose<br>papers from across the entire university<br>so this really allows you to shape your<br>degree<br>now to finish up with your degree in<br>climate 301 this is the last of the<br>compulsory papers for the degree<br>you'll get the opportunity to work with<br>an external organization<br>you will go out in groups<br>multi-disciplinary groups of five or six<br>students and what you will do is an<br>assessment of that organization's<br>emissions and you will try to develop a<br>low carbon strategy for them to consider<br>implementing<br>this will really give you the skills and<br>experiences that are going to be<br>necessary as we try to work together<br>towards a target of net zero emissions<br>now to conclude this little session i<br>want to talk to you about some of the<br>unique challenges we have here in<br>aotearoa you might be tempted to think<br>that hey climate change is a global<br>problem and so maybe people in other<br>countries can do something about it<br>but what's really important to realize<br>is that aotearoas greenhouse gas<br>emissions are very different than other<br>parts of the world this figure over to<br>the left shows you the breakdown of our<br>emissions into different sectors and<br>then you can see that almost 50 percent<br>of our emissions come from the<br>agricultural sector<br>when you look at other countries this<br>percentage is typically around 15 to 20<br>percent which shows us that agriculture<br>is something that we really need to<br>think about<br>how we do smarter here in aotearoa and<br>this is principally because we produce a<br>lot more food than we consume as a<br>nation and so we need to not cut our<br>food production right this is not saying<br>we need to massively slash and reduce<br>what we're doing in the agricultural<br>sector but rather we need to look for<br>smarter solutions we need to try and<br>produce beef or milk or whatever we<br>might be trying to do as efficiently as<br>possible in terms of our emissions<br>the second thing is in terms of our<br>electricity generation so here in<br>aotearoa most of our electricity around<br>96 of it comes from renewable energy<br>sources already<br>other parts of the world<br>they might only be operating at 10 15 20<br>of renewable energy and so when you look<br>at a strategy for another country they<br>might say hey we're going to shut down<br>all of our coal-fired power plants we're<br>going to replace those with renewable<br>energy sources and that's a really<br>viable strategy for those countries to<br>consider reducing their emissions but<br>here in aotearoa we don't have that much<br>capacity that is fossil fuel driven at<br>the moment to be able to cut so that's<br>not going to be an effective strategy<br>for us<br>however one thing that is unique for us<br>is the very high proportion of our<br>emissions that come from the<br>transportation sector so you might have<br>wondered why the government has focused<br>on a on<br>a move to increasing the proportion of<br>electric vehicles here in aotearoa new<br>zealand and that's because about 20 of<br>our emissions come from the transport<br>sector and of those about three quarters<br>come from passenger vehicles uh driving<br>around our nation's roads<br>so this is an area where we've got an<br>existing technology solution we do have<br>electric vehicles the question really is<br>around their affordability<br>and our ability to<br>change the infrastructure here in<br>aotearoa so that we can effectively<br>charge them at different spots around<br>the country<br>so we have a technology solution but the<br>issue we have is an economic and a<br>social one as to how we might roll out<br>and use electric vehicles to a much<br>greater extent<br>okay so that's it uh if you want to find<br>out more about the bachelor of climate<br>change uh to consider studying it here<br>in 2022 uh feel free to scan this qr<br>code or go to wakato.ac.nz<br>slash go<br>climate and i would encourage you to<br>take up the challenge of addressing our<br>emissions<br>you know that this is something that is<br>within our hands it takes individual<br>action and it takes uh students choosing<br>to take up their place in the workforce<br>as a climate change informed employee so<br>that's it that's all i've got to say<br>today<br>thank you very much for watching this<br>session<br>and i would love to see you here at the</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
