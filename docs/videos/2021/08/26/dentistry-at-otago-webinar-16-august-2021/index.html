hear from a couple<br>tonight and taught in internet<br>internationally recognized teaching<br>facilities<br>founded in 1907 it is new zealand's<br>national center for dentistry and is<br>ranked in the top 50 dental schools in<br>the faculty has a long and remarkable<br>history of education research and<br>service to the community<br>a purpose rebuild has seen a fully<br>operational<br>200-share clinical services building<br>patients are provided with oral health<br>care that is supported by the most<br>modern equipment and materials seen<br>the faculty of dentistry's dental<br>clinics undertake over 60 000 patient<br>there are large spaces for teaching<br>students simultaneously<br>such as in an operating theatre<br>three surgical surgical procedure rooms<br>and areas for viewing scans and<br>radiographs<br>students are trained to use the most<br>common electronic patient records<br>software in australasia with many<br>private practices also using a similar<br>version<br>this allows graduates to keep up with<br>any future digital developments in<br>dentistry<br>the new dental building is one of the<br>world's highest tech dental hospitals<br>sir john walsh building houses<br>pre-clinical and research laboratories<br>meeting areas and staff and student<br>of course a university dental school is<br>more than simply bricks and mortar<br>the faculty of dentistry at this<br>university of otago has a team of people<br>who are the leading edge of their<br>profession and who have an international<br>reputation for excellence in research<br>education and clinical service<br>the faculty is also fortunate to be able<br>to attract many internationally renowned<br>scholars<br>who either choose to spend their time<br>undertaking research at the facility<br>or who are invited to visit the<br>university<br>the faculty of dentistry offers a<br>friendly environment for undergraduate<br>a second new outplace clinic in auckland<br>was opened in 2020<br>the clinical center in south auckland<br>allows students to obtain experience<br>that build on the education and training<br>in dunedin and deliver the in the finest<br>oral health care for the new zealand and<br>that shows the state of art technology<br>patient smile<br>the tutor smile but<br>the students smile<br>and so when you're in a new facility you<br>know everyone just feels really good<br>the dental school here at the university<br>of otago is new zealand's only dental<br>school the national centre for the<br>industry<br>i chose otago because it was ranked<br>really high one of the highest dental<br>schools in the world<br>in second year it's a lot of sort of<br>foundation stuff that you need to sort<br>of focus on third year you transition<br>into the clinics and you already have<br>sort of a complement of patients that<br>you're responsible for and then in<br>fourth year you spend a lot of time<br>learning about all the different<br>specialties that give us the spectrum of<br>what you can do with this degree<br>there's opportunities to work<br>in hospitals there's opportunities to<br>work in defence<br>as an academic to work in general<br>practice<br>to study to become a dental specialist<br>it's an opportunity to care for people<br>to provide<br>treatment to interact with individuals<br>in a way<br>that's quite unique<br>we are after all surgeons<br>so we do surgical procedures in the<br>mouth the students are becoming<br>experienced in the very latest cutting<br>edge equipment means that when they<br>graduate from the university of otago<br>they head out into practice very well<br>prepared they're very attractive to<br>employers because they know about the<br>technology they know how to use it it's<br>part of the integrated workflow<br>and that sets them apart from<br>students from most other schools<br>actually<br>i would now like to introduce you to mrs<br>allison meldrum who will talk about the<br>bachelor of dental surgery and how<br>dentistry is a challenging profession<br>and very highly rewarding thank you<br>as you can see from the slide here that<br>dentistry is much more than teeth it<br>involves<br>social interactions it involves<br>understanding it involves a holistic<br>approach it demands good communication<br>skills it demands empathy sympathy and a<br>passion for what you're doing you have<br>to believe in what you want to do<br>we're lucky at the faculty of dentistry<br>that we have other disciplines and other<br>programs that we teach with the bachelor<br>dental technology and the bachelor of<br>oral health<br>there is some integration between the<br>programs not a lot but the good the big<br>large common room that we have allows<br>the students to interact into that<br>common room area and have a lot of fun<br>now you can see here that we talk about<br>how dentistry and the curriculum is<br>divided it's got three themes that go<br>through it<br>and these three themes are named and<br>with papers called dent papers they go<br>dent<br>261 which is the dentistry in the<br>patient dent 262 which is the biological<br>biomedical sciences<br>and then dentistry dent<br>263 which is the dentist in the<br>community and as you go up each year the<br>papers go up to three four<br>and<br>five and the programs are such that they<br>link both vertically and horizontally in<br>your first year most of the emphasis is<br>on the biological sciences where you do<br>oral biology some pharmacology anatomy<br>and physiology this is a big paper and<br>it demands a lot of you<br>your clinical paper is an introduction<br>to the clinical environment to diagnosis<br>to examination and the management of<br>patients a lot of the time is spent in<br>our fantastic simulation clinic that you<br>can use<br>but it's also getting to know techniques<br>getting to understand as<br>dr suarez said in the first video that<br>it's we're surgeons we do surgical<br>procedures so getting to use your<br>instruments to getting to use your hand<br>pieces getting to manipulate around a<br>small little hole that's the mouth<br>you also have to<br>understand the ethics of dentistry and<br>be able to communicate those ethics and<br>public health<br>dentistry concerns that we have and<br>that's the third year papers<br>and as you go through you get more<br>complicated with your and more and the<br>clinical aspect increases in its point<br>value and its time commitment and you<br>get better skills you learn to<br>do different things in your third year<br>you're in a clinic that's a general<br>clinic in your fourth year<br>you have clinics that um you get rotated<br>out into going to oral surgery<br>to oral<br>medicine to pediatric dentistry into<br>orthodontics so you're trying to link<br>all your different skill sets into that<br>and in your final year<br>you have a basis that you are trying to<br>link all this knowledge and you have<br>your clinics<br>in general practice<br>also in your final year you have a<br>clinical placement that you can do the<br>clinical placement is usually at our<br>satellite clinic here in dunedin<br>called takaika<br>and you go and spend<br>a rotation period through there where<br>you see<br>people of<br>maori or pacific island or low<br>socioeconomic groups or refugees student<br>patients that<br>need<br>treatment and they get treated in a<br>different way<br>and that it's a more private practice<br>emphasis at this takaike clinic<br>also we have something that's becoming<br>more and more important to the<br>university's interprofessional education<br>and interprofessional collaboration<br>and in second year next year we're<br>bringing in a bioethics into<br>professional communication and in third<br>year we have a non-communicable disease<br>and professional education moderate<br>module that<br>links all the health science professions<br>medicine dentistry pharmacy<br>physiotherapy oral health to develop<br>patient care and understanding so we all<br>understand that patients are not treated<br>and you can see here the different<br>entrance pathways that we have if you<br>want to come in from health sciences<br>first year you must do health sciences<br>first year at the university of otago<br>and you can see the requirements that<br>are here for<br>australian year 12 qualification ncaa<br>levels<br>the applications for health sciences<br>our entrance pathways are slightly<br>health sciences which i've explained to<br>in a graduate pathway that and because<br>you've got a degree from overseas<br>you'll come under this the alternative<br>category<br>and if you come<br>sorry i'll start that again but you must<br>have the equivalent of health sciences<br>first year to be able to enter this<br>pathway<br>the deadline for this is the 15th of<br>september all the information is on the<br>website and they're really good<br>guidelines about how to apply and what's<br>required of you<br>the advantage of having our degree as<br>victoria said earlier was that<br>we're internationally recognised<br>a number of my colleagues have worked<br>overseas<br>i've worked a lot overseas too<br>and<br>you can graduate and you can apply for<br>registration both with our new zealand<br>dental council and the australian dental<br>board<br>and you have that advantage although<br>you're registered here sometimes if you<br>want to practice in other parts of the<br>world you might have to apply for<br>registration or sit their registration<br>thank you so much alison<br>i'm now going to introduce you to<br>associate professor sun young ma<br>she started her bachelor of dental<br>surgery at otago and is now a leading<br>expert in the area of dental implants<br>for patients as a specialist<br>prosthodontist<br>as the associate dean of postgraduate<br>studies<br>associate professor ma will explain how<br>you can advance your professional career<br>or pursue a career in dental

for<br>that you contact him or her and find out<br>whether they are interested in taking a<br>new candidate after establishing some<br>kind of contact then you can move on<br>building your research

students who got<br>australian residency citizenship you<br>will be paying the equivalent of what<br>new zealand students study other either<br>undergraduate or postgraduate<br>so we do have undergraduate scholarships<br>for domestic and international students<br>any international student that's coming<br>from high school<br>into health science first year will be<br>automatically given 10 000 new zealand<br>dollars for a tuition rebate<br>and then when students are in health<br>science first year and you've applied<br>for the bachelor of dental surgery<br>we've got the health

one off scholarships<br>per year<br>we also have postgraduate scholarships<br>for<br>deep dent and phd<br>for the universe these both because<br>these are both university of doctoral<br>scholarships<br>um if you are um lucky to uh get the<br>scholarship this isn't automatically<br>given to you<br>um it is merit-based<br>uh you will be given uh new zealand 27<br>000 stipend per annum<br>plus the tuition fee waiver up to 36<br>months capped at the domestic rate<br>and for those that are doing phd which<br>is non-clinical<br>you even if you're an international<br>student you will pay the same as a new<br>zealand domestic fee that's why that's<br>not not a mistake it's around 10<br>right now i'd love to introduce you to<br>violina<br>violina is from indonesia and is<br>currently in her third year of the<br>bachelor of dental surgery<br>fiolina arrived in 2018 to complete the<br>otago pathway program<br>and came through health science first<br>year<br>competing for a place into second year<br>of the<br>bachelor of dental surgery program<br>currently in her third year fiolina is a<br>unibuddy<br>and you're more than welcome to contact<br>her directly through our website on the<br>international page i'll hand it over to<br>you really now<br>so hi everyone<br>i'm fiolina so i'm here to speak<br>for the undergrad student perspective so<br>i think so far my experience here at the<br>otago<br>faculty of dentistry is very enjoyable<br>and<br>i've also received quite a lot of<br>support from the teaching and the<br>administrative stuff as well<br>in terms of that the lecturers and the<br>clinical tutors<br>here they encourage us to think<br>critically<br>and they also encourage us to apply all<br>different um<br>aspects so theories that we learn in<br>second year so that we can<br>so that it can be relevant to<br>clinical dentistry and i think the<br>best part of it is that they are also<br>very approachable so it is really<br>gratifying when i can you know<br>say to my peers back home that i can<br>respectfully and comfortably email my<br>professors when i have queries without<br>feeling overly intimidated so personally<br>as an international student this has<br>become one less of a barrier<br>studying abroad<br>and then<br>another best part of studying here is<br>probably the level of clinical exposure<br>that i get so in every week<br>we get<br>three sessions of clinics with real<br>patients as third year student and<br>another extra simulation clinic per week<br>just to practice on new things<br>and then<br>this is very different to<br>what we have back home in indonesia<br>because i had a chat with a friend<br>a graduating dentist back home and then<br>that they told me how they have to<br>recruit it or find their own patients<br>and they have to buy their own handpiece<br>and materials like impression materials<br>so<br>unlike here which i'm very lucky to be<br>in everything's provided and the<br>patients have been triaged so that<br>they're suitable for level of<br>difficulties depending on what year<br>you are as a student so<br>it is really nice to be able to learn<br>how to work systematically from the get<br>go so that<br>i can build this habit so that i can<br>implement this workflow later after i<br>graduate<br>and<br>why i decided to go<br>with otago instead of<br>any universities abroad<br>is because when my parents and i were<br>discussing about studying abroad<br>we agreed that i should really<br>experience a whole new culture at once<br>and that's how we're set on<br>new zealand<br>so yeah and i really like it here<br>because um it's quite quiet though it<br>has its vibrant days from the student<br>cultures so it's um 50 50 of everything<br>and i think my parents feel more at ease<br>too knowing that kiwis are super<br>friendly so that i wouldn't have too<br>much of a difficult time reaching out<br>for help if i ever need to<br>thank you so much it's wonderful<br>i'm sure there'll be lots of questions<br>that these students will be wanting to<br>ask you<br>okay<br>now i'd love to introduce you to abe abe<br>is originally from jordan and he's also<br>been living and studying in dunedin<br>since 2018<br>uh currently studying a doctor of<br>clinical dentistry in prosthodontics<br>and abe will tell us what it's like to<br>study at otago as a postgraduate student<br>thank you victoria for the introduction<br>um i'll start with why choosing what i<br>love at other universities so i joined<br>otago based on<br>the previous deal of the dental school<br>recommendation professor<br>professor paul branton who was the one<br>of the external examiners in my final<br>year bob exam<br>back in jordan<br>um so i met him he told me about otago<br>he was he worked in the uk and also new<br>zealand he told me that i was um<br>as good as<br>the uk universities or even better yeah<br>so check um the episode i go the degree<br>is really great it qualifies you to work<br>at least in new zealand australia and<br>maybe in canada not sure about that we<br>have to check um<br>and also after completing the declining<br>degree you can<br>apply for the membership of royal<br>australian college so in some parts of<br>the world like in middle age for example<br>this membership is<br>really strong<br>on your cv it's stronger than the degree<br>itself sometimes yeah so<br>yeah so immediately after getting the<br>degree you can get that membership<br>yeah so overall the<br>excellent reputation of the title the<br>strength of the degree and also um<br>the<br>friendly nature of the people<br>um motivated me to<br>choose to talk over the universities<br>also talk about the<br>support and the clinical exposure that<br>are saved here<br>based of my based on my personal<br>experience so in terms of the<br>clinical support our survivors are<br>already<br>i'd say the best yeah best in the field<br>they're experts they're known worldwide<br>they have<br>good clinical skills good communication<br>skills they're very helpful to most of<br>the time in their offices so you can<br>easily approach them um discuss with<br>them<br>um<br>any questions and we have the staff<br>offices and the clinics on the same<br>floor so the student<br>supervisor interaction is<br>very easy and efficient<br>in terms of research we have the<br>graduate<br>research school therefore<br>workshops<br>every month lots of workshops and<br>statistics softwares writing everything<br>so if you're not<br>i'm sure about any aspect of your<br>research you can always<br>get more than excellent support in these<br>aspects in terms of the<br>clinical exposure um while the number of<br>patients that you get to treat might not<br>be as high as other universities but i<br>can guarantee that you will you will<br>learn to treat patients the right way<br>for me<br>i'd brain uh learn to treat patients<br>right away one patient right away rather<br>than treating 50<br>the wrong way or just so<br>always<br>quality over quantity<br>yeah<br>um yeah and that's it for me look at<br>this oh that's really interesting<br>so are you nearly at the end of your<br>yeah i don't know<br>last time yeah yeah<br>so you're are you going to stay on<br>i have to go back to jordan as i have<br>signed a contract they pay the tuition<br>fees<br>i go back right first you'll study two<br>years<br>then maybe after that i can<br>come back<br>thank you so much it's really<br>interesting<br>okay now we're going to open it up to<br>um everyone that's listening to the<br>webinar i'm sure there are some<br>questions and answers one thing i didn't<br>do at the start is i never told you that<br>our wonderful colleague<br>lauren hall is in the background and<br>she's been<br>looking at the chat and answering some<br>of your questions<br>lauren has there been um a few questions<br>coming in yeah i think um some really<br>good questions um a couple of things<br>just around the different pathways so<br>the graduate category and the<br>alternative category um i've also had a<br>question here which i'm wondering if<br>someone wants to to answer i haven't<br>replied to yet<br>but it's just looking to see whether new<br>zealand has a commonwealth supported<br>place<br>for students where<br>the government pays part of the fees so<br>i'm not sure um that might just be to do<br>with australian permanent residents but<br>maybe if you could just talk about how<br>australian residents are treated um if<br>they're studying here in new zealand for<br>tuition purposes<br>yeah so if you're on uh you've got<br>citizenship<br>basically you are deemed the same as a<br>new zealand domestic student<br>so you're not paying those international<br>fees that you saw on the slide you apply<br>you still have to apply the same<br>deadlines that were shown for the<br>different categories<br>but you will<br>basically be paying new zealand domestic<br>fees<br>with the commonwealth scholarship you<br>would have to look into research for<br>that whether and also sort of the<br>australian financial aid as well<br>in new zealand we call it um<br>study loans don't we<br>study link but so the equivalent in<br>australia i suggest if you want to come<br>and study at otago to contact the<br>equivalent in australia and just find<br>out sort of what financial support that<br>the government can give you<br>yeah great um we've got one more that's<br>just come in<br>um can a student with a bds degree and a<br>pg certificate in health science join<br>masters in dentistry in otago and um is<br>there any credit for a student in that<br>situation<br>so you can definitely apply to do<br>master's degree in dentistry if you have<br>bds plus the postgraduate certificate<br>there is no cross credit for your points<br>if that's what the<br>attendee is asking<br>yep so it's a bra it's a separate<br>program um depending on which master's<br>program you're doing as well whether<br>it's income dent or master in the<br>industry which has two endorsements<br>aesthetic dentistry and aurora health<br>great thanks<br>um great we had another question come in<br>and it's just generally around the<br>allocations um or places available for<br>the bachelor of<br>dentistry and through the different<br>pathways as well so obviously<br>undergraduate versus alternative and<br>things like that<br>we have 60 domestic places<br>then of those<br>the majority goes to two-thirds goes to<br>health sciences first year the other two<br>third goes to the alternative category<br>we have up to 35 international places<br>and<br>that depends on what category the<br>student applies in and whether they meet<br>the<br>great it's quite good olds isn't it<br>international it is<br>so we've got a question here about the<br>bachelor of dental technology<br>so the question is can high school<br>leavers apply straight away um for this<br>program or they need do they need to go<br>from health science first year and then<br>apply for it so what's the pathway for<br>they can apply straight away great<br>provided they've got<br>chemistry<br>and a background because they have to do<br>health sciences first year chemistry and<br>physics<br>the other thing too<br>for that student when you are applying<br>you want to apply you'll probably look<br>for bachelor of dental technology you<br>won't be able to find the program online<br>under application what you're looking<br>for is<br>health science undergraduate program<br>that's right click on that in your<br>application so all applications are<br>online it's called the evision portal<br>you'll be able to find it on the website<br>so if you're interested in oral health<br>or dental technology click on under<br>undergraduate health science profession<br>and then you'll see<br>once you're in there it'll say dental<br>technology oral health alternative<br>graduate and that's the way you go<br>actually on that note um i actually had<br>an email come in of a bachelor of oral<br>health student who's currently at aut<br>will be finishing their<br>degree<br>interested in now coming and doing the<br>bachelor of<br>dental<br>dental surgery um<br>what category should they choose well it<br>depends on how long they<br>come in as a graduate but they need to<br>have the alternative of health sciences<br>first year okay it's alternative and and<br>or equivalent<br>and aut<br>bachelor of oral health program is not<br>the equivalent of health sciences first<br>year<br>they don't have physics papers in it<br>okay so they need to have the physics<br>the public health<br>the hubs papers and things like that<br>right and they would um apply for<br>alternative categories undergraduate<br>categories and degrees where they've<br>been out for longer than three years<br>okay<br>all right so those deadlines are the<br>15th of september<br>so we've had a couple more questions um<br>come in around application processes so<br>um i've got a couple of questions one<br>around what the waiting is for ucat in<br>the application process<br>the waiting is it i can't tell the<br>weight and what the waiting is at the<br>moment because it changes each year<br>and<br>they have to pass<br>certainly the situation judgment test<br>and is a different percentage for each<br>of those different categories and we<br>don't know that until we've got all the<br>results in at the end of the year<br>and<br>the the ucat also helps us select the<br>number of students that we will<br>interview<br>right so actually that leads to the next<br>question what are the requirements to<br>i guess apply for an interview i guess<br>students if they're successful will be<br>invited to interview um and if those<br>requirements aren't met but you've still<br>got a student who's interested what are<br>they what are the options from there if<br>the student<br>has applied for an interview<br>yeah or they've been given offered an<br>interview<br>if they're overseas and then obviously<br>if they're in australia they won't we<br>would arrange a zoom interview<br>and then that would go into the mix of<br>all the other things and if the student<br>gets a good interview score then it goes<br>on gpa great but if they don't meet the<br>requirements before that they wouldn't<br>be invited to an interview they wouldn't<br>no<br>say the student is doing health science<br>first year and they didn't get a place<br>into dentistry yes what would you<br>suggest are the options if they still<br>want to be a dentist but just didn't get<br>through what are some of the options<br>they had to do a degree and apply the<br>graduate category way<br>so they would need to do that<br>and and then they would be very careful<br>to look at to see how<br>the points are allocated to the<br>different levels of the degree so they<br>try and get the best<br>gpa<br>and<br>there are different points and that's on<br>also on the website about how we<br>allocate second g and third year papers<br>you know 211 and 300 level papers get<br>allocated at a higher level than 100<br>level papers<br>um i was just thinking too say we've<br>you've got a<br>student that's halfway through their<br>bachelor of dental surgery at an<br>australian university and just with<br>what's happening who wants to come over<br>yeah no we have no pathway to transfer<br>except students through other programs<br>i've got a couple more questions here um<br>swan is around the master of oral health<br>so for students doing that program would<br>they get registration to work as a<br>dental hygienist following that no it's<br>not a registrational program they have<br>to be registered as<br>either a hygienist a therapist or a<br>dental therapist<br>great<br>i've got another question here um<br>for a student who's potentially um<br>studying in adelaide at their uni<br>foundation year and they're in the<br>dental stream<br>what was the what's the eligibility like<br>for coming into health science first<br>year and then obviously applying for for<br>dentistry is that possible<br>i suppose this they're talking is this<br>similar to foundation here is that yeah<br>pathway at a bender part and so they'll<br>just apply for self<br>health sciences in the past yeah 13th of<br>december don't they close yeah so yeah<br>so you'd apply for health science first<br>year program<br>and um so yep and you've got until about<br>the 10th of december to apply for that<br>oh by the way all our applications are<br>free too you don't have to pay for it<br>because i've heard that if you apply to<br>some australian universities there's an<br>application fee at otago no it's free to<br>one thing i didn't mention earlier on is<br>that there is actually an opportunity<br>for students in their fourth year to do<br>a bdsc honors<br>to do that they've got to get at least<br>enabler a<br>minus mark and their fourth in their bds<br>fourth year papers and it's a similar to<br>the fifth year in that<br>the elective paper is part of the<br>research and they do have to do another<br>research proposal paper<br>at the end of their fourth year start of<br>their fifth year<br>but it's quite an exciting opportunity<br>and there's up to eight places for bds<br>violina are you<br>going to go to the auckland<br>clinic in your final year are you<br>thinking you're doing that are you going<br>to stay in dunedin yes actually i'm<br>considering i'm going to the clinic so i<br>mean to auckland clinic so last semester<br>break<br>i actually went up to auckland to see<br>what it's like um the dental school<br>there so i actually quite like it<br>because it's kind of a compact version<br>of what we have um in dunedin<br>and um<br>i've heard a lot of positive reviews<br>from the previous students that have<br>done their um final year in oakland so<br>yeah unless unless something happens i'm<br>pretty sick<br>i'm going to open yeah it's both worlds<br>yeah exactly the university city and<br>then the big the big smoke<br>city<br>yeah<br>great<br>my dad said that<br>since you're already in new zealand<br>might as well just experience everything<br>that you can so<br>yeah great<br>and abe um<br>what's like the support for post-grad<br>like and i'm not talking you've talked<br>about the academic support<br>but um is there also sort of clubs and<br>societies or or a postgrad yeah<br>i'm a little bit of an introvert side<br>okay yeah that's right i'll be the right<br>person to answer this question yeah<br>but yeah<br>have you come by yourself uh with my<br>wife right and has she<br>found it comfortable here she's a<br>dentist oh is she yeah<br>so she's yeah she's<br>very happy here and she tried to um<br>start uh to study here but we're waiting<br>for a scholarship from georgia but we<br>couldn't get it so<br>yeah<br>that she's a dentist so yeah okay is she<br>working then no<br>because she has to um sit for the<br>registration exam<br>and then after that she<br>applied for losses and then yeah yeah<br>oh before too early you said you weren't<br>too sure if our degree degrees<br>recognized in canada but it definitely<br>is yeah yeah yeah yeah<br>the registration exams in canada though<br>it's just like it gives you a pathway to<br>sit there register yeah but i think it's<br>really shortcut like not<br>compared to other degrees maybe<br>not sure<br>not exactly sure but i think all the<br>information are available on the<br>um canadian dental association maybe<br>is your daughter's school age or she<br>just little oh no i have a<br>five month old oh five month old oh okay<br>i'll just go to save because i thought<br>it was a kiwi<br>that's so sweet<br>yeah because of course if she's from you<br>know school age um as you're doing a a<br>doctorate they can just come in and and<br>any international students with children<br>it's just domestic fees which is really<br>nice as well<br>yeah very nice yeah awesome<br>congratulations thank you fabulous<br>we've had a couple of other questions<br>come in um allison i'm going to pass<br>this um<br>first to to you which is just around the<br>advanced standing um pathway to come<br>into the bds program so could you just<br>outline what what are the requirements<br>what would you consider the really<br>important things um and how do things<br>like a gpa and the ucat<br>and work experience things like that<br>influence their application<br>it definitely does influence their<br>replication because we do look at gpa of<br>their degree also we look at the<br>understanding of what<br>that they've shown some evidence of<br>looking about dentistry in new zealand<br>and understanding the dental program at<br>the faculty<br>and at the continued professional<br>development that they've kept up and<br>that there<br>and it hasn't been years and years since<br>they graduated<br>as a dentist from their own and to apply<br>they have to have graduated from<br>a dental school outside new zealand and<br>australia so it has to be an<br>international dental school<br>great thanks very much and we've got<br>another um question that's come through<br>how many years should i study for<br>masters in community dentistry and is it<br>clinical or non-clinical<br>so master of community industry is a<br>non-clinical<br>program and same<br>work experience also is required so<br>approximately two to three year work<br>experience<br>violina um as an undergrad<br>you i'm just<br>thinking about accommodation and the<br>residential colleges that we have at<br>university of otago there's over 14 to<br>choose from very similar to university<br>of melbourne and university of sydney<br>that's a very collegial colleges do you<br>just give a quick sort of overview to<br>any undergraduate students how you found<br>the college that you were in like i mean<br>how did you find it when you were living<br>in the college and little just a little<br>bit about it<br>yeah so i actually went there during my<br>second year<br>and i think it's a great way to make<br>friends because<br>most of the students that got into the<br>college would have been first year<br>students and<br>it's a good way to make friends because<br>everyone's<br>just new to the university and<br>everyone's on the same boat and then you<br>get to express your interest as well<br>whether you're really good at sports<br>then you can play for the inter-college<br>sports or the inter-college art<br>performances<br>and<br>and i think the best thing out of um<br>living in the residential college is<br>that that's where you find your<br>flatmates for the following year so um<br>that's what happened to me right now i'm<br>i'm flatting with my um<br>friends that i made from the residential<br>college so<br>yeah<br>yeah i've heard that a lot people um<br>make friends for life coming from the<br>college which is yeah which is great<br>cool and also um part of and it didn't<br>say part of that ten thousand dollar<br>vice chancellor's international<br>scholarship is also guaranteed<br>accommodation as well but it's really<br>important that if you want to go into a<br>college or we have uni flats university<br>flats you must get your application in<br>by the 30th of october because they're<br>incredibly popular with new zealanders<br>as well as with international students<br>that are currently in new zealand in<br>australia<br>one other question that's just come<br>through around um registration so<br>could someone outline what the<br>procedures are for an overseas dentist<br>or someone who's studied overseas to<br>actually get registration to practice<br>here in new zealand there's two pathways<br>there's the pathway of sitting our<br>registration exams<br>or having your<br>degree individually assessed<br>and the dental council does that the<br>university has nothing to do with that<br>that's all dental council<br>great<br>one thing that we didn't mention is that<br>at the dental school there's a really<br>proactive dental students association<br>it's really interactive<br>it<br>it covers all aspects of it it<br>covers both the social aspect<br>the support pastoral care aspect and<br>also it has lots of educational aspects<br>with it and it has a proactive<br>group that will look after you and why<br>you agree with me yeah yeah<br>sorry i don't know why we didn't think<br>of saying that first of all it's um<br>and it's elected body and<br>also we have a<br>we had different year<br>we have a for the bds we have a bds2<br>bts3 bds4 bds5<br>year group and we have student<br>representatives on all those groups that<br>can give feedback and support and get<br>changes and<br>if they've got concerns so<br>you made the comment that<br>the professional staff are caring and<br>easy to access and that's another way<br>that that can be documented and the<br>students can get feedback<br>okay well it looks like that's sort of<br>uh the end of our question and answer<br>session<br>i just want to thank everyone to um that<br>has been at this webinar i was going to<br>say tonight but you might be listening<br>to it from home tomorrow um so thank you<br>everyone for<br>coming along to this and for everyone<br>listening i hope you found this<br>incredibly useful<br>um information<br>um please don't hesitate to contact ask<br>otago<br>if you've got any questions if you need<br>any sort of<br>wanting to know how to apply<br>um if you're<br>if you're from<br>australia and an international student<br>then they'll be brought through to the<br>international office<br>and we can answer those questions for<br>you and if you're an australian domestic<br>or new zealand domestic listening<br>university also can help you with your<br>questions as well so thank you very much<br>and we hope to see you either in 2022 or<br>2023<br>thank you very
