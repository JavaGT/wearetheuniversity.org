uh<br>today um myself and ruby will be<br>discussing our programs and what it's<br>like to study here with the division of<br>education um<br>and yeah enjoy<br>so the first thing i'm going to talk<br>about are the areas that you can study<br>within the division of education so we<br>offer the following undergraduate<br>degrees so we do a bachelor of teaching<br>and this is offered in primary and early<br>childhood education<br>and then we also offer<br>the graduate diplomas postgraduate<br>diplomas and masters of teaching and<br>learning which are our one-year<br>programs<br>all of these allow you to qualify as a<br>teacher um and they're all<br>specific for different areas so if<br>you've already done a degree you'd want<br>to do one of our one-year programs and<br>if you're new to the university you're<br>going to be looking at doing a bachelor<br>of teaching<br>we also offer a bachelor of social<br>sciences and you can major in digital<br>learning education and society and human<br>development within that<br>so where can a bachelor of teaching take<br>you so<br>when you choose a degree there's lots<br>and lots of opportunities within that um<br>and you're going to be studying to be a<br>teacher<br>and it can also lead on to further<br>studies so we've got masters of<br>education master of educational<br>leadership counselling and then<br>educational management as well<br>so once you've finished your teaching<br>qualification you can move on to one of<br>these master's programs if you're<br>so why choose waikato so<br>the really cool thing about our programs<br>is that we have<br>a collaborative university school<br>partnership so this is when our students<br>go into schools and they spend one day<br>per week<br>in the school in the classroom so ruby's<br>actually going to tell us about that<br>because she is experiencing that at the<br>moment ruby do you want to expand on<br>that every week we go into a classroom<br>you<br>have a mentor teacher there who's kind<br>of your first point of contact you learn<br>a lot from them you ask questions<br>you get to know the students in the<br>classroom which is really awesome and<br>you get to see how the theory that<br>you're learning in your lectures and in<br>your tutorials applies to<br>the actual classroom environment which<br>is really cool cool awesome so this is<br>something that is featured in all of our<br>programs including our one-year programs<br>as well so everyone gets to experience<br>that classroom and environment so once<br>you graduate you're ready and prepared<br>to find a job in the classroom we've got<br>some really great graduate success<br>and a lot of our students end up in jobs<br>within those schools they've gone to<br>throughout the programs or also around<br>new zealand<br>and you can also study this in hamilton<br>in tauranga and also online so we've got<br>options<br>for anyone no matter where you are<br>so where can a career in teaching or<br>education take you so most people would<br>obviously see the obvious which is<br>primary intermediate or secondary school<br>teacher but there are actually a lot of<br>other areas as well so you can go into<br>educational policy a learning consultant<br>we have people who specialize in<br>disability<br>you can go on to be a social worker a<br>counsellor an educational consultant and<br>you might even develop the curriculum<br>so if you're interested in education but<br>you're not too sure you want to be a<br>teacher this is where our bachelor of<br>social sciences comes in<br>so you can choose from these three<br>majors education society human<br>development and digital learning and<br>this is teaches you about the theory of<br>education um and not exactly just being<br>in the classroom but other pathways<br>through that a lot of our<br>students do a bachelor of social<br>sciences and then go on to do one of our<br>and these are the key dates so if you're<br>applying for a scholarship you want to<br>apply by the 31st of august hall<br>applications open on the 1st of august<br>close on the first of october and then<br>also our applications to study at<br>waikato are open now um to study to be a<br>teacher you do have to go through a few<br>extra processes so you've got to write a<br>personal statement<br>have two referees and then also do a<br>literacy and numeracy assessment and<br>come for an interview so we always<br>encourage you to apply early just to get<br>through these steps before the course<br>begins<br>cool so now i've just got a few more<br>questions for ruby<br>as she's experiencing the class um in<br>the course so i'd really like to get her<br>perspective so i've got a few questions<br>what has been the highlight of the<br>course so far for you<br>i would say that the highlight<br>will always be being in the classroom<br>with the kids they are just wonderful<br>they have a way of making your day<br>and they bring your learning to life and<br>so while i'm<br>teaching them and learning to teach i'm<br>learning so much from them as well and i<br>love being in a collaborative<br>environment all the energy<br>yeah just a really really cool place to<br>be awesome and that's the really great<br>thing about the programs everyone will<br>get to experience the classroom<br>and why did you choose to study to be a<br>teacher<br>um i've always felt a calling<br>to teach<br>um i can only describe it as it being<br>intrinsic<br>my parents are teachers and so they've<br>always encouraged me in that<br>but i love people and i'm really<br>fascinated<br>by<br>the way that teachers<br>can use their influence to enhance the<br>mana of<br>the future<br>generations is just really beautiful<br>cool and what advice would you give<br>someone who's looking at becoming a<br>teacher or going to study<br>i would say<br>try and find<br>or take up every opportunity you can to<br>teach so whether that's<br>taking dance lessons in your community<br>whether that's<br>becoming a swimming instructor whether<br>it's coaching<br>take opportunities to teach those<br>younger than you<br>older than you<br>any opportunity where you can<br>be learning and growing in<br>your profession<br>that you want to pursue awesome thanks<br>ruby thanks for joining me today thank<br>you all for visiting our virtual open<br>day if you have any
