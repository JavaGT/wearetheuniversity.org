zealand's largest<br>hiding in trees in the cliffs are<br>hundreds of burrows stuck by grey-faced<br>petrol<br>grey-faced petrol are a winter breeder<br>which is quite unique for new zealand's<br>sea bird species<br>when most seabirds are finishing their<br>nesting and returning to sea at the end<br>of summer grey phase petrol are just<br>starting to arrive for the first time in<br>autumn<br>so these birds arrive on mass at their<br>colonies at night get ready for the long<br>breeding season coming up for the rest<br>of the year<br>when we're going out for a night's work<br>at a colony we'll arrive just as the sun<br>sets<br>and that's the same time the birds start<br>returning and just as it gets pitch<br>black the birds will be landing on the<br>ground<br>the call we use to attract in the birds<br>is called war whooping and it<br>effectively sounds<br>like an indian call you might have made<br>as a kid and this is a really<br>attractive call to the bird they come<br>right up and they land on the ground<br>where you are<br>it's really easy to pick up these<br>greyface petrol because they have the<br>classic<br>problem of most species on islands which<br>is they don't have a predator defense we<br>can just walk up to these birds and pick<br>them up<br>but we have to look after them still as<br>they're really fragile so once we've got<br>this bird in the hand<br>we'll put a new ring on it if it doesn't<br>already have one<br>and then what we do is we just put a<br>little line of twink on its head so that<br>when the birds are scrabbling around on<br>the ground over the rest of the eave we<br>don't have to catch these ones again<br>grizzled veteran because they'll keep<br>that mark on the head<br>for about a week or two before it gets<br>washed off from their foraging at sea<br>the kind of habitat these birds like are<br>really exposed coastal headlands which<br>can have a lot of wind around them<br>and a lot of trees hanging over cliffs<br>take off spots<br>they tend to like these 30 degree slopes<br>uh which you're a human is kind of<br>comfortable walking on but you wouldn't<br>a lot of times we'll end up using the<br>zebra detection dog that will really<br>greatly increase our chances of finding<br>seabirds particularly in this<br>challenging environments<br>where it's very dense and there may be<br>the graphics petrol nest in a burrow<br>under the ground which they dig out<br>themselves and some of these burrows can<br>be<br>over a meter long what's going on it's a<br>bird but because they also lay this<br>single egg and nest in this borough it<br>makes them very vulnerable to predators<br>such as rats<br>or stones the university of auckland is<br>working with council and community<br>groups<br>to identify nesting burrows so they can<br>work out how to protect them<br>so we're collecting a lot of data on<br>these birds by banding a lot of them<br>working out where they travel at sea by<br>tracking them with tracking<br>devices at sea and bringing all of that<br>together to identify colonies the<br>priority sites for conservation in the<br>waitakere ranges<br>and then working with the community<br>groups and the local council<br>to get that predator control installed<br>so that we can see these<br>birds returning to the mainland for the<br>in a backyard the local team have<br>discovered a wood pile with a burrow<br>as it's very near to houses it's in<br>danger of disruption by cats and local<br>wildlife<br>so james has set up a wildlife camera to<br>monitor comings and goings<br>during the day it's a hive of activity<br>with all sorts of wildlife triggering<br>the camera<br>but at night the real action starts with<br>the female greyface petrol<br>when the birds return to lay their egg<br>that egg is laid at the end of july<br>so when this egg is laid the parents<br>will take shifts incubating it for a<br>week or two<br>swapping over and then the moment that<br>chick hatches<br>it's left unguarded it's at this stage<br>that the chicks the most vulnerable to<br>predation<br>great news in the okura burrow is an egg<br>with the petrols literally living<br>amongst them it's really crucial to get<br>the local community involved in<br>protecting these species<br>the parents come back about every week<br>or two to feed the chicks<br>and that involves them going for long<br>journeys out to sea where they can<br>sometimes fly as far down as the<br>sub-antarctic islands of new zealand<br>over a week to collect food<br>to feed the chick it takes a really long<br>time for their populations to recover<br>because the adults live for 30 40<br>maybe even 50 years they only have one<br>egg each year<br>and one chick which they try to raise<br>and<br>and it takes five years before that<br>chick even comes back and breeds for the<br>first<br>time<br>there is good news from our borough<br>camera<br>a healthy chick is hatched and is being<br>looked after by one of its parents<br>but in time the chick will have to be<br>left alone so its parents can both hunt<br>the local bird rescue centre has just<br>had a different greyface petrol chick<br>handed in<br>we do get adults in that's not unusual<br>especially storm wrecks<br>but having a chick come in not only is<br>it thrilling for us but it's it's a bit<br>of a first for us as well<br>we know that he was found in a garage in<br>pihar<br>by people who were moving in to stay<br>there for the week<br>and he was then reported to the rangers<br>who came over with him<br>from pihar to us so we really don't know<br>a lot of his early history it's a bit of<br>a mystery<br>we see a significant level of admissions<br>that are brought in by the cat most of<br>those animals will go on and die<br>and that is the sad part about it but of<br>course any wild<br>animals such as the mustelid family<br>predators<br>unlikely to take the prey and kill them<br>so we don't actually get those ones in<br>here<br>worrying news the chick has disappeared<br>and james is interviewing local<br>volunteer vicki<br>to understand what exactly happened i<br>checked the camera card and took it home<br>loaded it on the computer and to my shop<br>horror sadness there was<br>basically bypassed the traps went<br>straight to the burrow<br>and came out with this fluffy<br>chick in its jaws<br>and the chick it was quite<br>upsetting to see it was obviously<br>trying to escape wriggling squiggling to<br>get away<br>the ferret disappeared off camera<br>and i'd say a certain death for the<br>chick<br>within days of the chick dying<br>one of the adult birds returned and<br>it was filmed sitting at the entrance of<br>the burrow<br>just sitting looking around looking<br>perplexed i'd go so far as to say<br>looking a bit forlorn actually<br>uh wondering where's my chick<br>this sad story is a reminder of how<br>important it is to control<br>and eradicate predators we're not going<br>to be able to conserve grey-faced petrol<br>across the whole waitakere ranges<br>without the support of the public<br>and in particular that's through<br>community groups that are willing to<br>step up and protect<br>the grey-faced petrol colonies that are<br>on their local land<br>it's about everyone being involved and<br>doing their bit by putting out a<br>predator trap<br>and checking how many seabirds they have<br>breeding in their backyard<br>listing out for their calls at night and<br>so by having this<br>project bringing together all of these<br>different stakeholders<br>it's a really exciting time to imagine<br>what the future of waitakere<br>conservation for seabirds might look<br>like<br>thankfully this year a new trick was<br>raised in albarro<br>it's shared its baby plumage and is just<br>grey phase petrol are a really<br>charismatic species it's really<br>great to be able to call them in and<br>hear them make a little attractive<br>noises<br>back and then you you pick them up and<br>they're really quite gentle in the hand<br>and let you handle them and put a band<br>on them and<br>it really feels like we're working in a<br>partnership with them to restore the<br>land back to them<br>and everyone can see better conservation<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
