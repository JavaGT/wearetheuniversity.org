ecosystems<br>function please join me in welcoming<br>professor bell to the podium<br>thank you very much everybody um i guess<br>i have to apologize before i start for<br>those of you just came to see me in the<br>in the robes<br>um unfortunately the the robes were a<br>bit warm for me um<br>it's a real pleasure to see so many<br>people here tonight and um i'd really<br>particularly like to thank george from<br>coming all the way from taranaki<br>and some of our friends from coming all<br>the way over the hill from the y rapper<br>and of course my my family over there in<br>the in the background<br>um it's a real pleasure tonight to get<br>the opportunity to tell you<br>about my research over the last 20 years<br>or so focused on sponges<br>it's not very often apart from amongst<br>other sponge nerds that i get to talk to<br>people<br>about sponges so i really appreciate<br>so um i want to kind of go go back a bit<br>and start my spongy story tonight where<br>things<br>all spongy started for me i mean that's<br>a place that's quite a long distance<br>away probably as far away from new<br>zealand as you can get<br>and this is a lockham marine nature<br>reserve which is a small semi-enclosed<br>sea lock on the southwest coast of<br>ireland<br>and it's well known globally for being a<br>really rich biodiversity hot spot<br>it's only very small in size it's only<br>about one kilometer long and about 0.75<br>kilometers wide but extends down to more<br>than 50 meters in places and it has a<br>whole range of underwater submarine<br>cliffs<br>now lochine has a kind of unusual<br>geomorphology<br>such that you can see in the top corners<br>the picture of a narrow kind of tidal<br>channel that connects the lock to the<br>open atlantic coast<br>open atlantic ocean and this uh this<br>connection with the open atlantic ocean<br>creates an unusual flow regime with<br>unlock iron<br>and what we get is a really fast what we<br>get is a really unusual series a series<br>and really unusual different habitats<br>from one side<br>of the the lot to the other because of<br>this unusual geomorphology in this deep<br>site<br>we see that there is a gradient of flow<br>and sedimentation as we move from the<br>east to the west across the lock<br>which means we get a really wide range<br>of habitats within a really small area<br>so areas over on on the the eastern side<br>are really current swept and you get<br>lots of suspension feeders good light<br>penetration and lots of algae<br>but as we move across to the western<br>side the areas between it become much<br>more sedimented<br>and much more kind of turbid and what<br>would appear to be<br>um not a great environment as i said<br>this<br>um this site is a is a really well known<br>for its biodiversity<br>but one of the things that when i first<br>visited the lot back in 1998<br>that really took me was the diversity<br>and abundance of sponges in these<br>habitats<br>and particularly in areas where you<br>might not expect these kind of animals<br>to be particularly abundant<br>and what particularly took me was the<br>way that there are all these different<br>environments yet all these different<br>sponges appeared to<br>persist in all of these different<br>environments i was really interested as<br>a kind of young<br>undergraduate as to what was allowing<br>these organisms to survive<br>in these really quite different<br>environments<br>but i guess before i say anything else<br>about sponges i i don't want to make an<br>assumption that anybody in the audience<br>knows what a sponge is<br>so i should tell you what a sponge is so<br>sponges<br>are considered to be some of the oldest<br>multicellular organisms on the planet<br>they're i don't like to use this word<br>but they're very simple<br>metazoans they are basically a<br>collection of a few different cell types<br>and their body system is based around<br>our architecture of<br>water canals so the whole sperm is a few<br>different cell types that are arranged<br>in such a way<br>that the water can circulate through the<br>sponge tissue<br>now sponges have these specialized cells<br>that are characteristic of the phylum<br>and which are called koanocytes and it's<br>the quantosites that are responsible for<br>creating the current that flows through<br>the sponge<br>now sponges generally can can conform<br>all sorts of sizes and shapes we get the<br>giant barrel sponge which can be this<br>kind of<br>diameter maybe even this height and<br>through to little tiny little weeny<br>patches and i've been kind of interested<br>now what you're looking at here is a is<br>a sponge feeding this is in<br>real time courtesy of one of my phd<br>students who provided this video for me<br>and what you're looking at<br>is we've basically dyed the water around<br>the sponge uh with fluorescein and<br>you're looking at the sponge pumping the<br>water<br>that's been that's all surrounding it so<br>one of the primary things that sponges<br>do in the marine environment<br>is they are responsible for sucking in<br>large quantities of water<br>so this sponge is probably about the<br>size of half of your fist and it will<br>suck in and process its own body volume<br>probably in about 10 or 15 seconds so<br>it's really efficient and can<br>suck in really large amounts of water<br>now the critical reason<br>thing that that's really important for<br>is that<br>this water contains loads of particles<br>lots of food particles<br>carbon in all sorts of different forms<br>so that includes things like<br>phytoplankton includes things like<br>bacteria<br>and when it gets sucked into the sponge<br>the sponges are super efficient at<br>capturing those tiny particles<br>so there's all this water floating<br>around in the ocean that's got all this<br>stuff in it all this carbon in different<br>forms<br>and sponges are sucking in that water<br>and stripping out that particles<br>and both my own research groups work and<br>that other people in the world<br>have shown that these particles can be<br>removed with up to 99 efficiency<br>so they're really really good at doing<br>this<br>um back in the day probably 20 or so<br>years ago<br>this movement of movement of carbon to<br>the<br>the sea floor by sponges was thought to<br>be their kind of main functional role<br>and they were<br>responsible for kind of sucking up all<br>of this carbon and moving it to the sea<br>floor<br>however we now know from um again work<br>by my own group and from others across<br>the world<br>that this isn't really the end of what<br>happens to the the carbon story for<br>sponges<br>what you're looking at here is a<br>time-lapse photography in case you<br>hadn't guessed this is a<br>you know these are the the sad things i<br>get my students to do is take time-lapse<br>photography<br>of a essentially sessile organism and<br>but that's really interesting we've done<br>this on quite a few different sponges<br>and that seems to be where the really<br>interesting things actually happen<br>but what you're looking at here is a<br>sponge that we've time lapsed over a two<br>or three hour period<br>and you can see that there are what look<br>like worms crawling around all over the<br>surface of them<br>they're not worms they're a type of type<br>of sea cucumber<br>and what these worms are doing are<br>crawling around and we think they're<br>mopping up all of the mucus<br>that is combined and capturing sediment<br>all on the surface of the sponge<br>so they're moving around picking up all<br>of the the mucus that that's floating<br>around<br>in addition to this what people have<br>found is not only do sponges<br>suck up all of this carbon but they also<br>release carbon<br>those kawanasite cells that i talked<br>about a minute ago those ones that are<br>responsible for creating the water<br>current in sponges<br>they wear out really quickly and because<br>they wear out really quickly the sponge<br>gets rid of them as kind of detritus or<br>fecal material if you like<br>and all those little fish and things<br>that you see that are rocking up<br>occasionally they dub in and dub out<br>they're feeding on all of these<br>particles that the sponges are exuding<br>and you've got this kind of flow of<br>material this flow of energy<br>through the sponge whether the sponge is<br>transforming this energy<br>and making it available to other<br>so in addition to having this functional<br>role of basically sucking in water<br>stripping out the particles and<br>distributing this carbon on the seafloor<br>sponge sponges also do an<br>other range of important things the<br>first of these is that they provide<br>habitat for a whole range of other<br>species<br>so if you chop open a sponge you'll find<br>that all sorts of different organisms<br>are living within that little sponge<br>you'll find that there'll be worms<br>there'll be crustaceans<br>little crabs all sorts of shrimps and<br>things live inside the sponge<br>so they form their own little<br>biodiversity hot spots and the reason<br>that that's important is because those<br>small things get eaten by other stuff<br>they also have a really important role<br>in what we call bar erosion so<br>bioerosion is the biological breakdown<br>of<br>of rock material and usually we think<br>about this in the context of coral reefs<br>so our corals are the primary organisms<br>that are laying down lots of calcium<br>carbonate<br>it is organisms like sponges that are<br>actually<br>breaking down that calcium carbonate and<br>if those two things get out of balance<br>so the sponges break down more calcium<br>carbonate than what the corals make<br>then you end up with a situation where<br>the reef solely disintegrates and breaks<br>away<br>and we have seen examples of that across<br>the world they're also an important food<br>source for different organisms there are<br>lots of things that eat sponges<br>not so much actually in new zealand<br>waters but in the tropics there are lots<br>of<br>fish and lots of nudibranchs that<br>primarily feed on sponges<br>and the other really important role that<br>we're just starting to understand<br>is the ability for sponges to form<br>relationships with symbiotic organisms<br>now we've known for a really long time<br>that they do that but what we haven't<br>realized until quite recently and one of<br>my phd students rama has been finding<br>out<br>is that these photo symbols can actually<br>produce carbon that not only produces<br>food for the sponge<br>but under some circumstances there's<br>enough carbon to then be released<br>into the into the environment and then<br>form food for other things like microbes<br>so these sponges are what we call<br>facilitators of primary production<br>that is the the the animal the sponge<br>has<br>organisms in them typically<br>cyanobacteria that are photosynthesizing<br>like plants and producing carbon for the<br>sponge and to be released to the<br>external environment<br>for these functional roles these things<br>that sponges do to be important<br>requires something else and that is for<br>sponges to be<br>abundant in marine environments if<br>they're not abundant then these<br>important things that i'm telling you<br>are important for sponges<br>don't really matter and what i've found<br>throughout my<br>20 years of looking for sponges in all<br>sorts of weird and wonderful places in<br>the world<br>is that sponges are a really important<br>and often dominant component in<br>many marine ecosystems what you're<br>looking at here is a video<br>kindly captured by the remotely operated<br>vehicle that was purchased for us by<br>by george looking at the benthic<br>communities that you find<br>down about between 60 and 90 meters and<br>pretty much all of those little colorful<br>patches that you're looking at<br>i'm not going to say not all of them but<br>pretty much all of those colorful<br>patches and these branches that you can<br>see<br>are examples of sponges they have a<br>really wide range of biodiverse<br>really wide range of morphologies but<br>they're really abundant once you go down<br>below sort of 20 meters or so<br>and the graph that you're looking at<br>here which will be on your left<br>is a depth distribution graph looking at<br>the abundance of major groups of benthic<br>organisms as you descend with depth of<br>the poor knights and hopefully what you<br>can see is that sponges all of those<br>debts<br>the poor knights and lots of other rocky<br>reef environments around the country<br>are occupying somewhere between 40 and<br>50 of the available substrate<br>and the graph to the to the right shows<br>some data from a slightly shallower reef<br>except in the taranaki region<br>and you can see in these environments<br>sponges occupy somewhere between<br>kind of 15 to 15 to 25 percent the<br>available substrate<br>in pretty much most of the places in the<br>world where i've worked with the<br>exception<br>of some of the atolls in the central<br>pacific sponges nearly always<br>are a minimum of about 10 percent but as<br>you go deeper they tend to get much more<br>abundant<br>and just to demonstrate that this isn't<br>just the case for new zealand<br>and and sorry george you may not have<br>realized but at some point we we did<br>take the rov to indonesia<br>um i'm not sure if i told you about that<br>or not um but we also wanted to have a<br>look to see what these deep water<br>environments look like out on a tropical<br>coral reef and we were some of the first<br>actually to explore<br>the indonesian mesophotic reefs i mean<br>this is a kind of graphical<br>representation of what we found in the<br>shallow waters on a coral reef<br>you find lots of coral but once you get<br>down below about 50 meters<br>you get large barrel sponges and they<br>basically dominate the environment<br>so sponges become a much more a much<br>more<br>important and dominant part of the the<br>maroon ecosystem with depth on coral<br>reefs<br>most of my talk i guess if you read my<br>abstract was about sponges taking over<br>and it's worth just highlighting at this<br>point here that for most coral reefs<br>once you go down below 30 or 40 meters<br>sponges already are the dominant feature<br>of those reefs anyway<br>so it's more more a case of those those<br>sponge domination actually moving a bit<br>so my group a couple of years ago<br>embarked on a really large-scale<br>uh global review of sponge ecology to<br>try and understand<br>a bit more about the kind of global<br>nature and global patterns in sponge<br>biodiversity<br>any of my students in the room who are<br>involved in that review will remember<br>what a terrible terrible nightmare it<br>was and how long it took<br>um but one of the things that one of the<br>aspects of sponge ecology we tried to<br>collect the information for<br>was you tried to under try to collect<br>the information that was available on<br>the abundance of sponges across<br>different environments<br>and surprisingly it was very difficult<br>to get comparable estimates of sponge<br>abundance<br>across different parts of the world what<br>you're looking at here the numbers<br>actually represent the number of studies<br>for different biogeographic regions<br>for percentage cover on the bottom and<br>the number of sponge patches<br>on the top and hopefully again what you<br>can see is that for most of the places<br>where data were available<br>again they're pretty scant um sponges<br>occupy between norton 20 meters<br>somewhere around the 15 10 to 20 percent<br>mark<br>um so they're they're generally a pretty<br>pretty dominant feature<br>as we go slightly deeper than 20 meters<br>the amount of data is actually<br>really quite sparse to compare with and<br>most of that that we have actually comes<br>from my work and again<br>they um they generally increase in<br>abundance<br>so there are three primary things that<br>my<br>my group at victoria work on um the<br>first of these really stems from my<br>initial work back at lockhein<br>and that's a kind of traditional<br>ecological approach trying to understand<br>the factors that control<br>the biodiversity of sponges and what<br>controls those patterns through time and<br>space<br>secondly i'm really interested in what<br>sponges do so their functional roles in<br>marine ecosystems<br>so you know this filtering thing that i<br>told you about had a lot of students and<br>a lot of people working over the years<br>and trying to figure out just how<br>important that is in different<br>ecosystems<br>and finally what i'm going to focus the<br>rest of my talk on tonight is trying to<br>understand<br>how environmental degradation impacts<br>sponges and what that might mean for<br>now a lot of my work over the last 10<br>years or so is kind of centered around<br>this central idea and this<br>a central hypothesis that there may be<br>potential for sponges to become<br>a much more abundant feature of marine<br>ecosystems particularly tropical<br>ecosystems<br>than what they currently are and this<br>was an idea that i put forward with<br>with simon and a collaborator in<br>australia<br>nicole dr nicole webster and we proposed<br>based on some of our early experiments<br>and some of our observations from<br>different parts of the world<br>the sponges could become a potentially<br>more dominant feature of<br>marine ecosystems as you can imagine<br>there was a a lot of pushback to this<br>people didn't like this general idea and<br>i should say at this point<br>i'm not saying that this is a good thing<br>okay but humans are on a trajectory<br>where coral reefs are still<br>very much being degraded so it's really<br>important to understand what the<br>outcomes of us<br>continuing along those pathways may be<br>particularly given there are so many<br>people who are heavily reliant on<br>reef environments for their daily<br>protein requirements and<br>and other resources so i'm going to talk<br>a bit around this kind of general<br>hypothesis and the evidence that we've<br>got<br>to support this for the rest of my talk<br>so as i say we all kind of know what<br>trajectories of coral reefs look like<br>we often see pictures on tv um and they<br>show<br>and when you look at the data it's<br>pretty um it's pretty<br>convincing that coral reefs are in major<br>decline um<br>sadly most of that decline happened<br>quite some time ago in most locations in<br>the world particularly in the caribbean<br>but this degradation continues today and<br>it's really important that we keep<br>focusing on that<br>now prior to um myself simon and nicole<br>suggesting that sponges could be a<br>really dominant feature of marine<br>of coral reef ecosystems the current<br>paradigm or the<br>predominant paradigm in the literature<br>was that when corals die<br>those environments get completely<br>dominated by algae algae is the thing<br>that supposedly comes along<br>and that's what's written in all the<br>textbooks there are lots of papers about<br>it and there are lots of examples where<br>algae<br>do take over however there are also lots<br>of places in the world where<br>corals have declined and algae has not<br>taken over and in fact other organisms<br>like sponges have actually flourished<br>instead of the algae taking over<br>and the reasons for those are a whole<br>different talk<br>for the first bit of evidence i kind of<br>like to look at and i should say i'm i'm<br>probably well i'm completely<br>unqualified to actually talk about this<br>is thinking about if you're going to<br>think about what might happen in the<br>future<br>a good place to start with that is to<br>think about what happened in the past<br>and look at the<br>geological evidence for sponge roost in<br>the past<br>and as it happens there is actually<br>quite a lot of evidence in the<br>geological record<br>that there are periods in various<br>stratographic sequences around the world<br>where corals were doing really really<br>fine and then all of a sudden those<br>coral beds are replaced by beds that are<br>dominated by sponges<br>and i i have to admit here um has been<br>pointed out to me by several geologists<br>that these sponges are actually quite<br>different to the ones that we see today<br>back in the back in the day so 200<br>million years ago or so the sponges that<br>you found<br>on these kind of environments were ones<br>that could actually fire could actually<br>form a kind of consolidating restructure<br>and the ones that we find today can't do<br>that at all so these were able to<br>persist as a kind of thick geological<br>record and actually make you know reef<br>type structures along with other<br>organisms<br>so if you look back in the past there's<br>certainly evidence that sponges have<br>persisted<br>at times where corals were were<br>compromised<br>a particular occasion of this was about<br>200 million years ago<br>at the transition between the triassic<br>and jurassic which interestingly is also<br>thought to be<br>characterized by periods of ocean<br>acidification this was one period<br>where there are lots of sequences across<br>the world where corals have been<br>replaced by sponges<br>but i'll slightly move further forward<br>where i feel a bit more comfortable<br>and a bit more within my comfort zone<br>talking about these changes<br>i've been um super lucky over the the<br>time of my career to visit lots of<br>different places across the world<br>um and in a number of these different<br>locations i guess maybe i've sort them<br>out because i'm a sponge biologist<br>but there are quite a lot of examples<br>where reefs have changed from<br>ones that are dominated by coral to ones<br>that are dominated by sponges and i just<br>want to pick up<br>a couple of those just to you know kind<br>of hopefully support my argument<br>now the first of these examples is a<br>place called palmyra atoll<br>so palmyra atoll is probably one of the<br>most amazing ecosystems marine<br>ecosystems anywhere in the world<br>um it's in the central pacific it is uh<br>a national monument<br>it is an amazing biodiversity hotspot<br>and is described as one of those places<br>on the planet that has a<br>true intact trophic structure and what<br>we mean by that is it's got sharks it's<br>got manta rays it's got dolphins<br>everything you would imagine in a jack<br>cousteau film from 40 50 years ago<br>this place has basically got it there is<br>corals that are as large as this area<br>down here<br>they're huge they've been growing for<br>thousands of years<br>so we were lucky enough a group of us<br>from victoria university a few years ago<br>to be part of a kind of<br>a club or consortium which was funded by<br>the moore foundation<br>to go and visit palmyra and study these<br>ecosystems<br>um although palmyra and its outer reefs<br>is this amazing kind of oasis<br>for for marine life it has a quite a<br>dark history<br>and it's not all isn't quite as it seems<br>when you first first read about palmyra<br>so during world war ii palmyra was um i<br>don't say invaded that's probably the<br>wrong word<br>but in fact was occupied by the by the<br>u.s military<br>with plans to use it as a forward<br>launching base for attacks in the<br>pacific<br>and when they arrived in palmyra they<br>decided to make one or two changes and<br>one of the things they did is they<br>dredged all the lagoon<br>so the lagoons probably would have been<br>fairly shallow with lots of nice<br>branching coral<br>and they dredged all of that out the way<br>so that they could build a road all the<br>way around<br>that kind of wasn't enough i guess it<br>got you know it got boring driving all<br>the way around so then they put some um<br>some causeways across the atoll to uh<br>so they could go from from one side to<br>the other and they also blasted this<br>channel in at the bottom corner there<br>you can see what looks like a man-made<br>structure<br>and that is that's a blasted channel<br>into the lagoon so they could take the<br>supply<br>vessels in so what you can see from the<br>picture in there was one of my first<br>dives in the lagoon in palmyra<br>and you can see that in the back there's<br>a kind of ammo crate and then there's<br>some small<br>unexploded thing um in in the lagoon<br>palmar is kind of littered with all of<br>this old stuff which americans have<br>spent<br>millions and millions of dollars trying<br>to clear up quite a lot of<br>um so while everybody else was out<br>looking at these fantastic reefs all<br>around palmyra<br>um i spent a lot of my time in this<br>really horrible<br>looking lagoon area where it was really<br>sedimented hardly any coral you could<br>hardly see anything you wouldn't know if<br>a tiger shark was behind me<br>swimming around having a look to see if<br>anything had taken over that space by<br>corals<br>i should say that i wasn't the only<br>person from the vuw team<br>jonathan gardner at the top there who<br>also spent most of their time looking<br>around in these really interesting<br>turbid environments<br>but what we found is lots of these hard<br>rocky areas<br>were actually now dominated by sponges<br>so i had a<br>a a phd student ingrid nap he's now<br>working over in hawaii<br>she um she did a whole lot of survey<br>work trying to understand the ecology of<br>these sponges in palmyra<br>and what you're looking at here is this<br>graph at the top just shows the<br>abundance again as a area occupied of<br>sponges<br>different areas in palmyra all across<br>the lagoon and you can basically see<br>that the area occupied is something like<br>30 to 40 percent<br>of the available substrate if you<br>compare that with immediately outside<br>palmyra on the main reef there<br>sponges are only about one percent of<br>the cover okay so you could argue well<br>maybe these sponges have always been<br>there<br>maybe you know these sponges you know<br>aren't<br>isn't a new thing well i guess my<br>argument back would be well firstly this<br>is a coral atoll<br>so the substrate that the sponges are<br>growing on is coral<br>so at some stage there must have been a<br>coral reef environment there<br>secondly and importantly is most of the<br>dominant sponges that now live there are<br>actually non-native to palmyra that is<br>that they didn't evolve<br>and live in palmyra originally they have<br>come from somewhere else in actually in<br>the atlantic not in the pacific<br>so we know at some point in time maybe<br>it could have happened prior to<br>the military incursion or occupation<br>we know at some point in time there were<br>likely coral reefs or there were coral<br>reefs here<br>the second place i'd like to talk a<br>little bit about is one of my other<br>long-term study sites and in indonesia<br>and this is the wakatobi marine national<br>park<br>an area where i've been lucky enough to<br>work for the last 20 years or so<br>trying to understand um a little bit<br>about the sponge ecology there<br>and this is one of those places where<br>the more you learn the the less you<br>actually learn there's<br>there's so much to learn um the wakatobi<br>is it lies at the center of the coral<br>triangle so it's an area of extremely<br>high biodiversity<br>not just for sponges but basically for<br>anything but unfortunately like um<br>a lot of um countries in in asia it's<br>under extreme threat from a whole load<br>of anthropogenic impacts<br>the park itself has something like 100<br>000 people that live in it<br>and many of those people are directly<br>dependent on reef resources for their<br>for their daily food and for building<br>materials and things<br>so it means that these reefs have<br>undergone some major changes and shifts<br>over time<br>and this is some data from a phd student<br>not one of mine<br>but one from the university of essex a<br>little bit not quite before my time<br>but looking at the changes in coral<br>cover at six locations in the wakatobi<br>marine national park<br>between the period of 2002 and 2007 and<br>hopefully what you notice is at some<br>point between 2004 and 2005<br>the coral cover showed a really massive<br>decline and it's interesting to know<br>is nobody knows why that is nobody knows<br>what caused that<br>and scientists only spend a very short<br>period of time there so nobody knows<br>directly what that that cause was<br>um interestingly that then that then<br>continued and back in 2016<br>um i went back with a group of students<br>and we went back to all of these sites<br>and re-surveyed them to see if coral<br>cover was increasing decreasing or<br>staying the same<br>and unfortunately what we found is that<br>the coral cover continues to decrease in<br>the wacky tobit<br>now i wanna i want you to focus on one<br>site in particular<br>and that's the site at the very end of<br>the graph which is labeled sam<br>and that stands for sampela now sunpella<br>is a really interesting site<br>its coral cover was around 20 to 30<br>percent about 15<br>20 years ago and now its coral cover is<br>down to about five percent<br>now this site is really close to a human<br>settlement<br>and that human settlement appears to<br>have had a major negative impact on this<br>environment<br>the environments here are very<br>sedimented a bit like in loch iron<br>highly turbid bit like in loch iron and<br>these environments are<br>pretty much dominated now by sponges we<br>hadn't measured changes in the abundance<br>of all the sponge species over time<br>in this particular site but we have<br>measured the abundance and have a lot of<br>information for one particular sponge<br>which appears to be the dominant one<br>that is now found in<br>in some pellet this is um lamellar<br>dissidia herbaceous this<br>is this uh this is a photosynthetic<br>sponge so it's one of these sponges that<br>i talked about<br>earlier on that has photosynthesis<br>living within its tissues and provides<br>provides a sponge with food now one of<br>my phd students spent his whole three<br>years looking at this species because we<br>wanted to know<br>or we had an inkling that maybe this<br>species was increasing in abundance over<br>time<br>and you're looking at here data in the<br>abundance so the percentage cover again<br>of this sponge species at four different<br>sites and hopefully what you notice is<br>it's really abundant at sampela<br>and the reason that the abundance of it<br>decreases with depth is because it has<br>this reliance on this photosynbar so<br>more depth equals less light less<br>photosynthesis<br>if we compare the abundance of this<br>species with what i measured back in<br>2003<br>and this was the the first euro into the<br>wakatobi<br>um we collected the day in slightly<br>different way so it's not 100 completely<br>comparable but it's pretty comparable<br>we can see that between this time the<br>sponge has increased in abundance by<br>about sort of fifteen twenty percent<br>over a kind of ten fifteen year period<br>um andy<br>tried to have a look or did have a look<br>at the changes then in the abundance of<br>this sponge over a much shorter time<br>period<br>and what you're looking at here is the<br>percentage cover again of this same<br>species<br>over a much shorter period of time<br>between 2013 and 2015<br>and what you can hopefully see the the<br>hoga reef is a reef nearby some pellet<br>where<br>coral cover is still quite high whereas<br>sampela is this degraded reef and<br>hopefully what you can see is the<br>trajectory is still going up<br>still um there's still plenty of bare<br>space that's still available at sunpella<br>and we think that this species is<br>increasing such that<br>it's going to keep taking up that space<br>until there's none left<br>when you swim across this site sunpella<br>as well as this species there are<br>sponges pretty much everywhere there are<br>huge large bowel sponges which have<br>higher densities here than anywhere else<br>there are big branching sponges all over<br>the place<br>roof<br>so the next bit of evidence that i want<br>to talk about um<br>if as i'm suggesting sponges are going<br>to do better in the future<br>at the expense of corals this requires<br>them to<br>have greater resilience to certain<br>environmental stresses than what corals<br>do<br>and i want to talk a little about some<br>of the work that we've been doing<br>looking at the impacts of environmental<br>stress on sponges<br>and particularly to um to local scale<br>impacts<br>and we've done quite a lot of work with<br>sedimentation<br>and that's partly because we seem to<br>find a lot of sponges in really highly<br>sedimented environments<br>such as in loch iron like i talked to<br>you about at the beginning and also at<br>this site sampela in the wakatobi<br>and also in palmyra sponges as organisms<br>that feed on lots of water<br>and taking lots of particles might<br>actually seem not that well suited to<br>live in<br>really sedimented environments because<br>you might think that that sediment might<br>block up all of their water chambers but<br>that doesn't seem to be the case<br>so we've done a whole load of<br>experiments on a range of different<br>species looking at the ways in which<br>they deal with sediment<br>this was some work done on the giant<br>barrel sponges so these are the if there<br>was such a thing as a charismatic sponge<br>then this would probably be it i'm not<br>sure that<br>there are such a thing as charismatic<br>sponges but you know as i say if there<br>were<br>this would be it um and we did a whole<br>lot<br>a whole lot of experiments where first<br>of all we dumped a whole load of<br>sediment into the sponges<br>and to simulate kind of sediment falling<br>from above and we'd go back<br>and it wouldn't be there and everyone<br>was a bit puzzled<br>as to how a sponge was getting rid of<br>this sediment that we dumped inside it<br>until we use the time lapse photography<br>again what you're looking at here is the<br>inside of a barrel sponge we've added<br>some sediment<br>and what the sponge does is it produces<br>all this mucus which basically binds all<br>around the sediment<br>and then gets carried out in the exhale<br>and water current from the sponge<br>like you saw in that picture of the<br>sponge in the tank and that's what<br>you're looking at it all kind of<br>flocculates together with the sediment<br>and that then gets washed out when the<br>density of it becomes low enough to be<br>carried in the water<br>we've also done a whole load of<br>experiments where we've exposed sponges<br>to<br>sedimentation concentrations in the<br>water column and<br>consistent really with what we found for<br>sponges in<br>new zealand as well we find actually the<br>sponges don't really care<br>they appear to have greater energy<br>consumption probably as a result of<br>producing mucus<br>but they don't really seem to be that<br>we've also done sediment experiments on<br>this sponge lamella dicidio this is the<br>sponge that's increased in abundance at<br>this site in the wakatobi<br>and what we did with this species is it<br>lives in a sedimented environment<br>so you might imagine that actually it<br>would be really bad for this species to<br>have sediment on its upper surfaces<br>because it's got these symbionts which<br>need light and so what we did is we<br>exposed the sponge to sediment on its<br>surface we<br>dumped sediment on top and we basically<br>watch what happened and what you're<br>looking at here is a graph showing how<br>the spa how the amount of sediment<br>changed over time on this sponge<br>and what it basically does again is<br>produces large amounts of mucus which<br>binds all together with all the sediment<br>and then sloths off the top of the<br>sponge<br>um we have found that this is a<br>relatively energetically expensive<br>process so when we first dump the<br>sediment on the sponge he doesn't seem<br>to like it<br>and its energy consumption completely<br>stops then over time it starts to<br>produce this mucus and this mucus<br>uses up energy in the sponge and and<br>basically produces this mucus<br>and this continues over time then as we<br>reach the end of the experiment it's got<br>rid of all the sediment its energy<br>expenditure drops again<br>to match what it was at the start of<br>experiment so these but the key here is<br>that these processes are energetically<br>expensive for the sponge<br>so if they live in sedimented<br>environments they're producing mucus<br>this mucus costs them energy which means<br>they've got less energy to invest in<br>other processes like reproduction and um<br>and growth<br>it's not just sediment that we've<br>exposed sponges to to be honest we've<br>we've started to expose when just all<br>sorts of different<br>all sorts of different stresses and we<br>find a pretty<br>similar response in most cases in that<br>they seem to be particularly<br>tolerant to a whole range of different<br>things so i've had a student working in<br>mauritius<br>who was exposing sponges to increased<br>levels of nitrogen and phosphorus<br>and that's because in mauritius they<br>have large plantations of um<br>sugarcane and that sugarcane requires<br>lots of nutrient inputs<br>and here we were concerned that these<br>lagoon sponges around mauritius might be<br>really negatively impacted by that<br>however we exposed all those sponges to<br>nutrients and they just go<br>yeah they're just not bothered at all<br>they seem to be really tolerant to these<br>things<br>in contrast we know that both sediment<br>and nutrients are generally<br>quite detrimental to corals i should say<br>because i know there are coral people in<br>the room that that's not the case for<br>all corals but in general corals don't<br>like increased levels of nutrients or<br>um the kind of final bit of evidence i<br>want to talk about is the potential for<br>sponges to<br>deal with larger scale impacts and those<br>particularly associated with climate<br>change<br>particularly ocean acidification and<br>temperature<br>i was lucky enough and i consider it<br>luck because i'm still waiting for the<br>second one i was lucky enough to be<br>funded by<br>marsden a few years ago to study the<br>impacts of ocean acidification on<br>sponges<br>and particularly to understand their the<br>impacts so their responses<br>trying to identify some of the<br>mechanisms if they were able to deal<br>with responses to sediment<br>so to climate change and also to look at<br>some of the things that might be<br>impacted if sponges became a more<br>dominant feature of these<br>these environments i was lucky enough to<br>work on the australian institute of<br>marine sciences national sea simulator<br>um while we at victoria have a an<br>amazing<br>coastal ecology laboratory this is kind<br>of next level it's specifically designed<br>to simulate all of the different<br>environmental conditions that you might<br>want to manipulate<br>if you're running experiments on<br>organisms and making those conditions<br>as natural as possible so as well as<br>exposing sponges to<br>increase temperature for example you can<br>fluctuate you can<br>you can simulate fluxual fluctuations as<br>a result of seasonal changes in<br>temperature as well so you can<br>kind of add on a couple of degrees to<br>what a sponge might experience over a<br>long period of time<br>and we expose sponges to a range of<br>different conditions<br>obviously we expose them to what we get<br>now so that we could compare<br>how they might respond to different<br>climate change scenarios<br>and these are just details of the the<br>different ph's and different<br>temperatures that we expose sponges to<br>which represents different projections<br>as far as the ipcc<br>scenarios go we worked on a whole range<br>of different species ones that are<br>mostly common on the great barrier reef<br>but also ones that are common at<br>different places across the world as<br>well<br>and obviously you can imagine i've got<br>um dreams and rooms of data from uh from<br>from three years of study and it's all<br>going to boil down to just this one<br>one graph from me um there were loads of<br>really cool things that we found out<br>part of this project but one of the<br>things there are a few things that were<br>unexpected<br>the first thing we found that was<br>unexpected is we<br>we exposed adults and sponges sponge<br>larvae<br>to different temperatures and different<br>nasty treatments and we found that<br>nearly always the larvae of sponges were<br>more tolerant than what the adults were<br>and we don't know why<br>the other really interesting thing kind<br>of is is demonstrated quite quite well<br>by this graph<br>now this is uh this species here<br>carteria spongy foliations is a species<br>that occurs across the indo-pacific<br>it's uh kind of become one of our model<br>species we're working on in the lab<br>it's a phototrophic species again so it<br>has cyanobacteria which live within its<br>tissues and are providing<br>carbon and food and what you're looking<br>at is the response of this sponge to<br>different treatments of ph<br>and temperature and the response<br>variable that you're looking at so<br>what we measured was the amount of<br>necrosis so how much of the tissue had<br>gone bad<br>and how much of the sponge had actually<br>bleached so it lost its colour<br>because the photosymbols which are<br>living in its tissues have been lost<br>if the sponge gets unhappy similar to<br>corals then they kick out their symbols<br>and on the bottom you've got uh so if we<br>can move the mouse on the bottom here<br>you've got the<br>three different temperatures<br>representing the different ipcc<br>scenarios<br>and for each one of these temperatures<br>we reduce the ph and expose sponges to<br>these different ph's<br>remembering that 8.1 is current and 7.6<br>is the really bad scenario<br>and it's worth noting that most people<br>think that the 7.6 scenario is the one<br>that we<br>might still be heading for if we don't<br>stop what we're doing<br>but hopefully what you notice here and<br>consistent with pretty much all the<br>other stuff that we've done with<br>ocean acidification on sponges and<br>consistent with what other people have<br>done across the world<br>if temperature stays the same and the<br>ocean becomes more acidic sponges pretty<br>much don't care<br>again showing a high level of tolerance<br>again for most coral species we know<br>that that that's not the case<br>if we ramp up the temperature a bit we<br>find that at the lower ph we do start to<br>see some tissue<br>necrosis and some tissue damage once we<br>get to<br>the 31.5 degree temperature so which is<br>quite an extreme climate change scenario<br>um that's a pretty high temperature for<br>for most organisms<br>we see something that we found that was<br>that was what we thought at least was<br>really interesting<br>if the temperature gets to 31.5 degrees<br>and<br>and the sponges experience normal ph<br>then<br>all the sponges basically died in the<br>tanks they all just melted when horrible<br>however as we reduce the ph and this is<br>bear in mind this is what we're<br>expecting as a result of climate change<br>changes reduce ph and increase in<br>temperature we found that<br>it was actually a kind of mitigating<br>factor for the sponge<br>so if you expose them to high<br>temperature they die but if you expose<br>them to high temperature<br>and reduce the ph at the same time they<br>show much higher levels of survival<br>and we believe this is some interaction<br>between the sponge and the symbiont that<br>enables it enables it to tolerate these<br>really extreme conditions<br>and we found this was consistent across<br>our phototrophic species that we looked<br>at<br>i should say i'm still waiting for my<br>second mars and grant to understand the<br>exact mechanism of this<br>um but it was probably one of the most<br>interesting and unexpected findings<br>and and supports this idea that sponges<br>may at least tolerate<br>future conditions a bit more than corals<br>so the final thing i just wanted to<br>touch on before i finished um<br>was really what this might mean for the<br>way that the coral reefs actually<br>function<br>and that's kind of where where work has<br>got to for me<br>and i guess it's slowed down a bit due<br>to covid and not being allowed to<br>to travel to these tropical places<br>anymore but as well as understanding if<br>sponges are actually going to be there<br>for for some of the time in the future<br>um it's also worth starting to think<br>about what things they might influence<br>on coral reefs<br>now all of these functional roles which<br>sponges have<br>and do if their abundance changes then<br>all of these different processes are<br>going to be influenced<br>i want to talk about really two<br>different processes that we think are<br>going to be<br>particularly influences and some of my<br>phd students in the audience will<br>recognize some of their pictures<br>stolen from their phd thesis thanks albu<br>um so one of the things that<br>um that we are concerned about is that<br>if we shift from not necessarily you<br>know all the corals going but if we<br>shift from a reef that's dominated by<br>more sponges and corals do we maintain<br>the same level of habitat complexity<br>now habitat complexity is like that<br>measure of how<br>complex the roof looks is there lots of<br>spaces are there lots of gaps are there<br>lots of you know structure and<br>three-dimensional shapes to the reef<br>and we know reason that that's important<br>is that we know that biodiversity and<br>reef productivity<br>are really correlated with habitat<br>complexity get much higher reef<br>productivity more species in areas where<br>there is more spaces and the reefs more<br>complex<br>and that makes sense because there's<br>more places for things to live and alby<br>um abby did some really cool 3d<br>photogrammetry<br>where he basically created 3d models of<br>different reef structures<br>some areas where places were dominated<br>by sponges some that were dominated by<br>corals<br>and was able to assess what the holes in<br>the reef might look like it might seem<br>like a crazy thing to do<br>but the reason is is we wanted to know<br>if there was space for all the animals<br>on a reef to live<br>what he found was sponge dominated reefs<br>would still create quite<br>big holes so big fish could shelter from<br>their predators and hide away at night<br>and but he also found that there are a<br>much smaller number of smaller holes<br>and you might think oh why is that<br>important why does it matter if there's<br>no small holes<br>whereas the small holes that are the<br>ones where all those small fish that<br>everything else<br>eats live so if you lose those small<br>holes then there isn't so much food for<br>all of those other things to<br>feed on so if reefs do transition to a<br>more spongy dominated state<br>doesn't necessarily mean that there<br>isn't going to be any food for people to<br>eat<br>but it probably means that there's going<br>second surprise graph i can see charlie<br>somewhere in the audience i've seen her<br>walking before<br>this is from another one of my phd<br>students work is recently completed um<br>and she was really interested this is<br>going back to that reef in sampela<br>that's become kind of a model system for<br>us and trying to understand<br>what the impacts of a sponge-dominated<br>reef might be since we've got one to<br>work at<br>and charlie was using stable isotope<br>analysis which are kind of powerful<br>tools<br>looking at the ratio between common and<br>rare isotopes and particular elements<br>to tell us something about the trophic<br>structure so the food web relationships<br>of different organisms on roofs and<br>the different food sources of which<br>things so the different food sources and<br>what things feed on<br>and what charlie found one of the things<br>charlie found lots of really interesting<br>things in this wreath but one of the<br>things that charlie found<br>is each one of these dots or each of the<br>different colors represents a different<br>fish<br>and each one of these these dots<br>represents the stable isotope<br>composition for carbon<br>which is used to identify the things<br>that things have been feeding on<br>and nitrogen which is gives us an<br>indication of where things are in the<br>the kind of<br>food web trophic structure so each one<br>of these dots represents an individual<br>fish<br>for uh for a different type of fish and<br>what we found is that the<br>sponge-dominated reef<br>is most things had a much wider spread<br>of their data<br>suggesting that they have to feed on a<br>much wider range of things on<br>sponge-dominated roof<br>sponge-dominated environments than what<br>they do on a high coral cover<br>environment<br>she also found that the overall range of<br>carbon sources<br>for most species were much smaller so<br>the things that they had available to<br>eat there weren't so many of in these<br>sponge-dominated reefs<br>but the the things that lived there had<br>to then go and forage much<br>much more for those those things<br>so hopefully we're still at an early<br>stages of trying to understand what<br>these sponge-dominated reefs might look<br>like<br>and how they they might actually<br>function but what it does mean is that<br>there are major implications for<br>the um the the fish that they'll support<br>and the overall productivity that<br>they'll support and it will change<br>compared to<br>to ones that are dominated by corals<br>um so thanks again for um for listening<br>to me talk about sponges for a bit but<br>just uh<br>i guess a few key points i i i didn't<br>want to overwhelm you with how amazing<br>and important i think sponges are i<br>think<br>you know they have a really important<br>range of functional roles in marine<br>ecosystems<br>and although i tell people that lots<br>most people you know listen a little bit<br>in deeper water environments these<br>things are super abundant they are<br>really really important they're you know<br>important supporting fish they are<br>providing nutrient recycling all these<br>free services<br>and in most places they're not protected<br>and they need to be protected<br>um i presented some evidence to support<br>that sponges may be one of the more<br>dominant organisms on reefs<br>and i think you know there is increasing<br>evidence that they are<br>more tolerant to many corals<br>than the sponges are more tolerant than<br>corals to many different environmental<br>stresses<br>but that isn't necessarily a good thing<br>the key thing that we're finding out as<br>we look at how these reefs function<br>with sponges as a dominant organism is<br>that they're going to be less productive<br>than the ones that are dominated by<br>corals so we need to preserve the corals<br>as much as i would perhaps you know like<br>more research filling to work on sponges<br>i'd be quite happy to see sponges at<br>their normal level on a coral reef which<br>is you know somewhere between five and<br>ten percent<br>not fifty to a hundred percent the other<br>thing to bear in mind is that while<br>sponges might take over from corals<br>it will essentially be a short-lived<br>thing so they might persist for several<br>hundred years<br>but if there is no the sponges are<br>living on the coral that's dead<br>so as things break down that coral<br>that's dead there will eventually be<br>nothing for the sponges to live on so<br>they're not going to last you know<br>indefinitely<br>the other final point i'd like to make<br>is a lot of my research is focused on<br>kind of what we call local scale impacts<br>things like sedimentation and nutrients<br>there's an awful lot of focus in the<br>literature and in the media<br>about our thinking about climate change<br>impacts which are really really<br>important<br>but we mustn't also forget those local<br>scale impacts things like sedimentation<br>nutrients all those things that we can<br>actually control ourselves or we can<br>control at a country level and don't<br>necessarily need international<br>agreements for<br>thanks very much i would just before i<br>kind of finish up just like to<br>to say thank you i'm not going to go<br>through everybody's name don't worry i<br>know people<br>dying probably for a glass of wine about<br>now um but i i<br>i just really really like to really<br>really like to highlight and say thank<br>you to<br>all of my students all of the work that<br>i've done wouldn't been possible without<br>the<br>the large number of phd students who all<br>have done amazing things have been super<br>cool to work with over the years<br>um i'd also really like to thank all the<br>various funders up there<br>i really appreciate that and a whole lot<br>of key collaborators both within<br>victoria<br>and um overseas you're listed up here<br>and and you know who you are if you're<br>in the audience<br>or you know you're watching it back on<br>the video um but thanks very much for<br>all of your help and support<br>it's um really means a lot to me and i<br>guess finally um<br>i'd like to thank my family um i'm<br>hoping that john and poppy will be<br>super keen sponge biologists um and i<br>i'd particularly like to<br>to thank claire and and apologize for um<br>every time i've come back from a trip to<br>some fantastic place and she says have<br>you got any great pictures and i go you<br>know i've got loads of great pictures<br>unfortunately then she realizes there's<br>4 000 pictures of sponges<br>and sometimes the spa same sponge from<br>lots of different angles which you know<br>she particularly likes particularly<br>likes those ones<br>but thanks very much and it's been a<br>the province chancellor of the<br>wellington faculties of science health<br>engineering<br>architecture and design innovation and<br>it's my great<br>great pleasure to give you the vote of<br>thanks to professor<br>james bell for tonight's lecture<br>teherangawaka is known for its focus and<br>expertise<br>on the impacts of climate change and<br>equally<br>the wellington faculty of science has a<br>strong international reputation<br>in marine biology professor bell's<br>research is<br>at the forefront of both of these and<br>we have heard tonight as he continues to<br>make a huge contribution<br>to global understanding of a sponge<br>ecology and the impact of human activity<br>on our oceans<br>professor bill's work shows the<br>importance of keeping an eye<br>on what's going on at the bottom of the<br>sea<br>and how important sponges can be in<br>illuminating this<br>he has shown how these ancient animals<br>are<br>major components of benthic communities<br>globally<br>and fascinatingly how they are often<br>more resilient to human mediated<br>stressors compared to other ethnic<br>organisms<br>the global scale changes we are seeing<br>on coral reefs across the world<br>are resulting in changes in the dominant<br>fauna<br>professor bell's research tells us that<br>sponges could be potential future<br>winners<br>in coral reef environments already his<br>work has<br>identified a number of reefs around the<br>world where sponges have become the<br>dominant fauna<br>and shown how these shifts to<br>sponge-dominated reefs<br>will cause major changes to the way in<br>which coral reef ecosystems<br>function given that a billion humans<br>rely on coral reefs for resources such<br>as food<br>the impact and importance of his<br>research is very clear<br>as the vice chancellor has noted<br>professor bill's contribution goes<br>beyond his decades<br>of leading research he is a dedicated<br>and innovative teacher<br>and program director and has a strong<br>positive impact on the study<br>and careers of many young people he has<br>made<br>and continues to make an invaluable<br>contribution to the school of political<br>sciences<br>and the wider university community<br>james it has been a pleasure to<br>congratulate you on<br>a fantastic inaugural professorial<br>lecture i would like to invite<br>everyone to join us in the common room<br>outside for some refreshments<br>but before doing that please join me in<br>thanking james again for a fantastic<br>lecture</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
