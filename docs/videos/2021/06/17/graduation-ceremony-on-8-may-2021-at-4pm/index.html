speaker<br>dr gemma gigan an evolut evolutionary<br>biologist and virologist<br>gemma is a senior lecturer in the<br>university's department of microbiology<br>and immunology and is also an associate<br>scientist at the institute of<br>environmental science<br>and research this year she is co-leading<br>a project in which<br>genomic sequencing is used to track the<br>evolution of the covet 19<br>virus and its transmission chains within<br>new zealand<br>dr gigan is from scotland and would have<br>enjoyed that<br>song and graduated<br>bsc bse honours degree<br>from the university of strathclyde in<br>glasgow<br>followed by a phd from the university of<br>otago<br>she then traveled to the united states<br>where she worked with a group at new<br>new york university on hiv research<br>before winning a post-doctoral<br>fellowship<br>from the university of sydney<br>she later established her own research<br>group at macquarie university in sydney<br>before moving back to new zealand in<br>early march 2020<br>just prior to the national lockdown<br>during the lockdown she juggled the care<br>of her then one-year-old daughter<br>as well as a busy schedule of research<br>dr gigan has recently been awarded a<br>rutherford<br>discovery fellowship from the royal<br>society of new zealand<br>please join me in welcoming dr gemma<br>gegan<br>chancellor vice chancellor members of<br>the university council<br>my colleagues and to the proud families<br>and friends<br>and to you for most people their final<br>year at university<br>is the most challenging one but for you<br>well it was the year that the world<br>stood still and it will be remembered in<br>history<br>as the year of covet 19. you have<br>graduated during unprecedented global<br>pandemic<br>it was caused by a virus that jumped<br>from wildlife into humans and quickly<br>swept the world<br>it caused the world to lock down it led<br>to healthcare systems being overrun<br>and it has caused devastatingly high<br>rates of mortality and morbidity<br>but in new zealand we took a different<br>path we were told to stay home to save<br>lives and that's what we did<br>and in doing so has meant that we can be<br>here today to celebrate together we can<br>be here in 3d<br>when most of the rest of the world faces<br>record numbers of reported cases and<br>deaths and even<br>more inevitable lockdowns so let us<br>focus on what can become of our<br>experiences through this extraordinary<br>year in history<br>let us focus or try hard to find the<br>silver linings<br>i too am part of a cohort that graduated<br>during a notable year in history<br>that was a global financial crisis but<br>that seems a bit insignificant in<br>comparison<br>but nevertheless the post university<br>paths were somewhat uncertain back then<br>and for me while well navigating the<br>unknown<br>i had absolutely no idea what i wanted<br>to do as a fresh young graduate<br>i was eager for adventure so i decided<br>to leave my home<br>small small home town in scotland and<br>move to the furthest away place possible<br>dunedin<br>i also decided it was going to be much<br>easier to stay at university rather than<br>leaving base reality so i undertook a<br>phd here at otago<br>i often think back to that time that in<br>circumstances were different<br>easier perhaps maybe i wouldn't have had<br>a strong desire to escape<br>and i wouldn't have come to this<br>extraordinary place on earth i now call<br>home<br>and i wouldn't have met my kiwi husband<br>or had our kiwi daughter<br>and i wouldn't have met those lifelong<br>friendships that um<br>while flatting as a student when it was<br>colder inside than out<br>and i wouldn't have had that vital<br>mentorship that i experienced here at<br>otago<br>i wouldn't have gained the<br>qualifications that allowed me to take<br>up research positions around the world<br>first in new york and then in australia<br>working with world-class researchers at<br>the forefront of my field<br>i wouldn't have gained those invaluable<br>experiences that would<br>eventually allow me to find a path to<br>come back here<br>to the university of otago and i'm<br>really just at the beginning of my<br>research journey<br>my research interest lies in<br>understanding how viruses evolve<br>viruses are perhaps the best examples of<br>evolution by natural selection<br>where their evolutionary processes can<br>often be so rapid they can be seen in<br>real time<br>darwin would have loved viruses i study<br>virus evolution on both the macro<br>evolutionary scale<br>where viruses and their hosts have<br>co-evolved for hundreds of millions of<br>years<br>and at the microevolutionary scale where<br>a seemingly novel virus jumps a species<br>barrier<br>and emerges in a new host and how it<br>might then evolve where it spreads<br>in populations through space and time so<br>in late 2019 when we were making plans<br>to move back to otago<br>i had a fleeting moment of panic about<br>what i should work on next<br>little did i know about the next few<br>years we were all about to experience<br>looking at the pandemic through a lens<br>of an evolutionary biologist<br>allowed me and my colleagues to see the<br>value in sequencing the genomes of the<br>virus to better inform our response to<br>coven 19.<br>i think it's fair to say that genome<br>genomics has played a starring role in<br>new zealand's response<br>and everyone in new zealand knows now<br>knows the term genomic sequencing<br>but when i was sitting where you are now<br>i can tell you i didn't have a clue what<br>i was going to do<br>i didn't know that i would be working at<br>the forefront of the response to a<br>global pandemic<br>but i could see where i could have some<br>value this year we will remember the<br>lockdowns the disruption<br>the fear and the sickness but if we<br>search for those silver linings<br>most of all there is an incredible<br>transformation in enthusiasm for science<br>we are just 16 months into the worst<br>global pandemic in 100 years<br>but science has enabled over a million<br>coronavirus genomes to be sequenced and<br>shared to track new variants in real<br>time<br>science has informed the development of<br>cutting-edge vaccine technologies<br>and science has aided mathematical<br>models to understand the virus's<br>trajectory that informed our elimination<br>strategy in the first place<br>in short and i hate to quote matt damon<br>some 20 years from now when you're<br>running your world-class scientific<br>research institutes or you're the ceos<br>of the world leading companies<br>you will tell your students and your<br>employees how you graduated during the<br>pandemic<br>and the resilience that you learned from<br>this experience<br>is a secret to your success you have<br>shown how to overcome uncertainty and<br>because of this<br>you'll be a better scientist than those<br>who have come before<br>the pandemic has changed the world but<br>you who graduated during this time in<br>history<br>are the ones who are best equipped to<br>lead us into this change<br>you have the opportunity to lead us into<br>the new post-pandemic age<br>so as variants and vaccines dominate our<br>lives this year<br>i urge you to use your education and see<br>where you can add some value<br>you don't have to know yet what you will<br>do or where you will do it or how you<br>will do it<br>just know that as you navigate this<br>uncertain time<br>opportunities exist for you that you<br>probably don't even know about yet<br>but you can seek them out and you can<br>remake this world congratulations and<br>thank you very much dr giggin for your<br>thoughtful and engaging address this<br>afternoon<br>we've enjoyed hearing about your<br>personal and research journeys<br>our graduates have displayed qualities<br>of adaptability and resilience<br>which have been necessary when dealing<br>with so much disruption<br>we trust that they are able to see the<br>silver linings<br>and take advantage of opportunities in<br>the post-covered world<br>which will be characterized by<br>uncertainty<br>complexity and constant change<br>i ask you please to join me once again<br>i also wish to thank the acting vice<br>chancellor<br>professor nicholson and our academic and<br>professional staff<br>at all of the universities campuses<br>we wish to thank them for their<br>outstanding contribution<br>to ensuring our students benefit from<br>the emancipatory power<br>of an excellent university education<br>thank you also to our staff for their<br>tireless work<br>during the pandemic ensuring that the<br>university continues to maintain<br>its teaching research and outreach<br>programs<br>the university council was very<br>conscious<br>of the empathetic and collegial way that<br>all staff have supported our students<br>and their colleagues during the alert<br>levels<br>i invite you to join me in expressing<br>our appreciation<br>to our extraordinary staff<br>to you who have graduated or received<br>diplomas<br>i offer the congratulations of the<br>university on your new status<br>and i welcome you to its full and<br>permanent membership<br>i charge you by the common bond that now<br>unites us<br>henceforth to cherish the good name and<br>reputation of the university<br>and to strive for the advancement of<br>knowledge<br>and the extension of understanding<br>i trust that in your different vocations<br>your lives may be fruitful of good<br>to yourselves into those among whom you<br>live<br>on behalf of the university council i<br>thank you all<br>for sharing in the celebration<br>particularly those of you who have<br>traveled<br>long distances to be here i wish you<br>the academic handsome guardians will now<br>be sung<br>the words are printed inside the back<br>cover of the graduation booklet<br>please stand for the ansem and remain<br>standing as the academic procession<br>retires<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
