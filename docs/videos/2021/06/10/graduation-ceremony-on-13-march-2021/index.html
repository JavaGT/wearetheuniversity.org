english the<br>words are printed inside the back cover<br>of the graduation<br>i call on the public orator to present a<br>candidate<br>there are aspects of our university life<br>that have deep historical roots<br>one of these old and cherished<br>traditions is the granting of honorary<br>degrees<br>for centuries universities like otago<br>have preserved the right to grant<br>honorary degrees<br>for one important reason it is the<br>single ceremony<br>that allows the university to most<br>clearly state the values and ideals it<br>wants to uphold as an institution<br>it allows us to recognize an outstanding<br>individual<br>who has displayed professional endeavour<br>compassionate action<br>intellectual innovation and reflection<br>and courageous leadership<br>today we honor our outgoing vice<br>chancellor professor harleen hayne<br>as someone who has lived up to the very<br>highest values we aspire to<br>every vice chancellorship is shaped by<br>two things<br>the character of the individual who<br>holds that office<br>and the uncontrollable nature of the<br>particular moment in history that they<br>encounter<br>when professor hayne was appointed vice<br>chancellor of the university of otago in<br>2011<br>she had already had a career marked by<br>outstanding achievement and leadership<br>her national contribution was recognised<br>by being made an officer of the new<br>zealand order of merit in 2009<br>for services to research a celebrated<br>scholar<br>head of the department of psychology<br>then a deputy vice chancellor<br>she was a popular choice to take the<br>next step and in doing so<br>also happened to become otago's first<br>professor hain took up the position at<br>an especially challenging moment in our<br>collective history<br>her first challenge was the christchurch<br>earthquake<br>by mid 2011 the sheer breadth of the<br>necessary recovery effort was becoming<br>apparent<br>including for our own campus staff and<br>students in christchurch<br>she reflected on taking up the role of<br>vice chancellor in the following way<br>beginning a big leadership role in a<br>crisis enabled me to see exactly what<br>this institution is capable of<br>that the people the staff the students<br>were incredibly strong and resilient<br>the christchurch earthquake was only the<br>first of a series of crises and<br>challenges<br>that defined the decade of her<br>leadership including a demographic<br>downturn in the number of school leavers<br>the lagging effects of the global<br>financial crisis and difficult<br>on campus other challenges emerged<br>including the theft of exam papers<br>a shooting threat serious injury or even<br>loss of student lives<br>often in deeply distressing<br>circumstances then the terrible events<br>of the mosque attacks<br>and more recently the bomb threats that<br>shut down graduation ceremonies in 2020<br>in the words of one university leader<br>it's hard to imagine<br>a similar period of such relentless<br>challenges for the university<br>given her own assessment of our moments<br>of crisis reveal the strengths and<br>weaknesses<br>of the university as an institution this<br>unprecedented decade of trial confirmed<br>something else<br>it revealed that we've been blessed with<br>a remarkable leader<br>the vice chancellor has been the<br>architect encourager<br>and executor of a profound demonstration<br>of the capacity of a university to<br>respond<br>to be resilient to recover and to<br>compassionately and intelligently lead<br>if the vice chancellor has been an<br>outstanding leader in times of crisis<br>there is another dimension to her<br>leadership that must also be recognised<br>and celebrated<br>professor haine has engineered a<br>transformation in the way this<br>university engages with<br>and supports students other university<br>leaders describe this<br>as the hain doctrine that students must<br>be at the center of the actions concern<br>and care<br>of university management this approach<br>was strongly informed by her own<br>research into adolescence and<br>risk-taking<br>her experiences as a very<br>student-focused teacher and is the<br>parent of two remarkable daughters<br>who grew up in the campus environment<br>throughout her career she has been a<br>champion of the university as a living<br>community for staff and their families<br>then as vice chancellor she made a<br>powerful commitment to the idea<br>that our students needed to be drawn<br>into a deeper community<br>when asked about what she considers her<br>most important achievement as vice<br>chancellor<br>she picks out one particularly telling<br>moment<br>the tragic death of sophia christani and<br>the eventual signing of the sofia<br>charter<br>which represents the culmination of a<br>community-based approach to student<br>well-being<br>the charter only became possible because<br>of the previous nine years<br>of engagement in relationship building<br>by this vice chancellor<br>with ousa the north dunedin community<br>police<br>emergency responders and the city<br>council<br>it stands as a poignant legacy to the<br>life of one talented young student<br>but it is also a potent signifier of the<br>hane doctrine<br>that the central concern of university<br>life must be healthy<br>happy high achieving students<br>as she leaves us the fruits of her<br>leadership are becoming abundantly clear<br>we are currently experiencing an upsurge<br>in student enrolments<br>the university has arrived in 2021 and<br>the strongest financial position<br>of any university in australasia and the<br>university's reputation as an<br>intellectual leader has been hugely<br>enhanced<br>all this happened in the midst of the<br>covert pandemic<br>because under professor hayne's<br>direction the university has found its<br>strengths<br>rather than its weaknesses when<br>responding to a crisis<br>professor harleen hayne has led us<br>through a tumultuous decade in our<br>history<br>in it she helped reveal us to be a<br>university with huge resilience<br>and a very promising future as a<br>student-centered institution<br>but she also revealed herself to be a<br>remarkable leader<br>fiercely intelligent hugely energetic<br>and at heart someone who cares who<br>deeply cares about this university<br>and everyone who is part of its<br>community she has changed the way in<br>which we think about what is possible<br>in a university leader and created new<br>pathways for others to follow<br>but above all she has broadened the way<br>in which we think<br>and act as a community<br>recognition of all that she has done for<br>us we honor her now<br>chancellor i have the honour to present<br>for graduation in the degree of

award of this honorary degree<br>today<br>and i am incredibly privileged that i've<br>been given the opportunity to share some<br>words with you<br>now i'm going to begin my remarks today<br>with a bit<br>of a confession as many of my colleagues<br>know<br>i am a chronic weeper<br>i cry not only at weddings and funerals<br>but i also cry during the singing of the<br>national anthem<br>or when i happen to stumble across the<br>university of otago commercial on<br>television<br>i cry not only when i am sad or happy<br>but when i am grateful proud or moved in<br>some way<br>now some of you might think that my<br>tearful disposition is a product of my<br>gender<br>but i'm not entirely sure that that's<br>the case<br>i come from a long line of weepers<br>both my father and my brother have never<br>been ashamed to cry<br>our family has always believed that<br>tears are good for the soul<br>that they signal to others that what is<br>happening<br>is important in some way now i'm going<br>to do my very best to hold myself<br>together during this speech<br>but given how important today is for all<br>of us<br>i make no promises that it won't all end<br>in a puddle<br>over the last 10 years i've had the<br>pleasure of attending well over 100 of<br>these graduation ceremonies<br>in preparation for each ceremony it was<br>my job<br>as the vice chancellor to select the<br>guest speaker<br>in my written instructions to those<br>speakers<br>i always told them that they should aim<br>to speak for no more than 10 minutes<br>and that they should leave graduates<br>with a message that would stick with<br>now that i'm standing on this podium i<br>think i owe more than 100 graduation<br>speakers a<br>huge apology it is impossible<br>for anyone to say anything to you right<br>now<br>that will stick with you for a lifetime<br>the best that any of us can do is to say<br>something that touches your heart<br>right now in this particular moment<br>so that's what i'm going to try to do<br>today and along the way<br>i will offer some very gentle advice<br>that might be helpful<br>as you embark on the next phase of your<br>my first heartfelt message goes out to<br>the family and friends who are here<br>today in support of our graduates<br>i know exactly how you feel right now my<br>own<br>brilliant and beautiful daughters are in<br>the audience today<br>and i clearly recall the overwhelming<br>sense of pride that i felt when i<br>watched them cross<br>the stage at their graduation ceremonies<br>so on behalf of the university of otago<br>i want to thank<br>you from the bottom of my heart for<br>entrusting your young people to us<br>we have done our very very best to<br>provide them with a world-class<br>education<br>but we've also tried to support them as<br>they've taken their final footfalls to<br>adulthood<br>i certainly hope that each and every one<br>of you here today<br>spend some time relishing the amazing<br>sense of pride that you feel<br>and i wish you the very very best for<br>your family celebrations<br>after this ceremony concludes<br>now my primary heartfelt message is for<br>our graduates<br>you are here today as folks who have<br>already graduated in absentia<br>but who felt that this ceremony was so<br>important<br>that you wanted the full in-person<br>experience for that<br>i thank you and i'm absolutely delighted<br>to share it with you<br>in addition to the december security<br>threat many of you have had multiple<br>graduation ceremonies cancelled due to<br>the pandemic<br>over the last year coveted 19 has<br>wreaked havoc<br>on new zealand and the rest of the world<br>we have all felt<br>fear and frustration many people have<br>lost loved ones or their livelihood i<br>think we can all agree<br>that much of 2020 was challenging<br>but as i've reflected on the year i<br>realized that the pandemic has also<br>taught me some really valuable lessons<br>first it reminded me of the importance<br>of physical and psychological contact<br>with the people in my life<br>during lockdown i really miss seeing and<br>spending time with my staff<br>my students my friends and my family<br>as children we are all taught to hold<br>hands and stick together when crossing<br>the street or crossing a river<br>but coveted 19 reminded me that even as<br>adults<br>we need to hold hands and stick together<br>so as you go forward on the next phase<br>of your journey<br>i would strongly encourage you to hold<br>hands and stick together<br>form teams in your workplace and<br>community<br>make it your mission to find common<br>ground with people around you<br>in doing so don't be afraid to share the<br>stories of your life with the new people<br>that you meet<br>not only the stories of joy and success<br>but also your stories of heartache and<br>failure<br>the scars that life has left on your<br>heart have undoubtedly made you a better<br>and more empathetic person don't shy<br>away from telling those stories to<br>others<br>and make time and space for others<br>to share their heartfelt life-changing<br>the second lesson that coveted 19 taught<br>me is that we should all count our lucky<br>stars that we live in a country where<br>knowledge is valued and respected<br>one hallmark of new zealand's response<br>to covet 19 is that it has been<br>evidence-based<br>and much of that evidence has been<br>provided by academic experts here at the<br>university of otago<br>so as you go forward don't ever be<br>afraid to use your knowledge<br>you have received a world-class<br>education here at otago<br>use it daily use it not only in your<br>workplace<br>but also use it to solve problems in<br>your community<br>your country and the rest of the world<br>going forward teach your children and<br>your grandchildren the value of<br>knowledge<br>reminding them that knowledge is the key<br>to overcoming prejudice and injustice of<br>finally covet 19 taught me<br>that i am braver and stronger than i<br>ever<br>imagined i must admit<br>that when i walked out of the clock<br>tower on the eve of our level 4 lockdown<br>i was terrified i had no idea<br>how this university a university that<br>has built its reputation on an in-person<br>collegiate experience<br>was ever going to survive physical<br>separation<br>and online learning i was well aware<br>that it was entirely possible that at<br>some point during lockdown<br>we wouldn't be able to make payroll<br>but in the end we not only survived<br>we thrived in the pandemic professional<br>staff moved<br>mountains so that we had what we needed<br>to do our jobs<br>pastoral care staff looked after<br>thousands of students who remained in<br>our care<br>academic staff quickly mastered new<br>teaching platforms<br>and gave countless hours of extra<br>tuition to students<br>while they were also homeschooling their<br>own children<br>and you our students adapted quickly to<br>a new way of learning<br>and you did better in 2020 than you did<br>so as you go forward in your own life in<br>your own career take this lesson with<br>you<br>do not be afraid of life's challenges<br>although we are slowly moving our way<br>through the challenges of covet 19<br>there will always be new challenges<br>ahead and when they come<br>remember you are braver and stronger<br>than you ever<br>imagined when i reflect on what i<br>learned<br>during the pandemic i am struck by the<br>parallel<br>between my lessons and the classic<br>children's film<br>the wizard of oz growing up i loved that<br>movie<br>i've probably seen it more than 20 times<br>as a child i was captivated by the<br>dramatic<br>shift from black and white to color as<br>dorothy was transported from kansas to<br>oz<br>i loved glenda the good witch and i knew<br>all the words of a soundtrack that has<br>as an adult however i have learned other<br>things from the wizard of oz<br>that three things that we all seek are a<br>warm heart<br>a wise brain and the courage to face our<br>fears<br>these are the things that the tin man<br>the scarecrow and the lion were seeking<br>from the wizard<br>what they learned on their journey<br>through oz was that they had these<br>things all along<br>for me the value of love wisdom and<br>courage<br>has been underscored by our experience<br>with covet 19.<br>in order to survive and to thrive we all<br>needed a warm heart<br>a wise brain and the courage to face our<br>fears<br>i also learned that what i was looking<br>for down my own yellow brick road<br>was right there in front of me all along<br>but the other fundamental message of the<br>wizard of oz is also not lost on me<br>today<br>with a click of her ruby red slippers<br>dorothy reminded all of us there's no<br>place like home<br>as you have heard today i have literally<br>spent half of my life here<br>at the university of otago otago is my<br>home<br>but like many of you i am about to<br>embark<br>on a brand new and somewhat scary<br>journey<br>far far far away from home<br>but as i go i will take with me all of<br>the important lessons that i have<br>learned<br>at this fine university<br>in closing as all of us prepare for the<br>next<br>phase in our life's journey i know that<br>we will continue to need<br>warm hearts wise brains and the courage<br>to face our fears<br>no matter where we go next we should<br>also remember<br>just as dorothy taught us there's no<br>place like home<br>i wish you all the very best for a<br>heart-filled<br>wise and courageous future and please<br>know that like me you will always have a<br>home<br>tena tenetato<br>katoa<br>thank you very much vice chancellor for<br>your
