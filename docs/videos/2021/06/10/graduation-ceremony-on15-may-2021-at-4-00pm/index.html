your<br>wonderful achievements<br>and congratulations to whanau and<br>friends who are celebrating with you<br>today<br>either here in person or from afar<br>a special shout out to those who have<br>overcome adversity to be here today you<br>know who you are<br>those who are the first in your family<br>to graduate with a university degree<br>and to our phd graduates who have<br>received the university's highest degree<br>today<br>and to my wife linda and eldest daughter<br>ali<br>graduates you are now part of only 6.7<br>percent of the population of the world<br>who have a university education that<br>figure<br>6.7 percent has an interesting tourism<br>parallel that is very important to the<br>future of the industry in aotearoa<br>since the late 1970s the global airline<br>industry has successfully recruited<br>100 million frequent flyers<br>yet it is estimated that only six or<br>seven percent of the global human<br>population<br>has ever flown in an airplane most of<br>the growth in global tourism in recent<br>decades has been driven<br>by increasing air travel demand in the<br>most wealthy societies<br>the uneven distribution of air travel<br>consumption also arises<br>within those societies in the us and the<br>uk<br>for example 70 percent of all flights<br>are consumed<br>by only 15 percent of the population<br>in a world threatened by climate change<br>the injustices of air travel have become<br>glaring<br>those who fly a lot contribute<br>disproportionately to climate change<br>which most impacts the most vulnerable<br>who never fly<br>flight shame could there should<br>therefore come as no surprise<br>something has to change and tourism<br>destinations will be challenged to<br>respond<br>of course this was all prior to the<br>covert pandemic and we know<br>that covert has changed to everything<br>you are the covered<br>generation of graduates well done you've<br>had to be very adaptable<br>in fact covert has forced upon us change<br>that<br>in many cases we knew was necessary and<br>overdue<br>so why did we wait for a crisis my first<br>word of encouragement is to be an agent<br>of positive change<br>every day use your education to<br>challenge the status quo<br>don't wait for a crisis it's<br>hard to talk about tourism to this<br>audience at this time<br>prior to covert graduation was a point<br>in time when many students headed off<br>overseas to take on the world<br>by denying us all the pandemic has<br>reminded us<br>just how important travel and tourism is<br>to us it's in our dna<br>quite literally unfortunately tourism<br>can be a destructive force<br>we have probably all seen tourism at its<br>worst in different places<br>but tourism can also be a very powerful<br>positive force it allows us to seek out<br>distant horizons<br>tourism at its best is about connecting<br>with people in place<br>allowing us to develop deep connections<br>and understandings<br>in 1989 linda and i graduated and headed<br>off on an oe<br>after work in the uk through the summer<br>of 1990 we headed off with our backpacks<br>to explore the continent<br>where we eventually made our way to<br>chanakali and then across the straits to<br>gallipoli<br>it is really difficult to imagine what<br>the anzacs faced on the morning of the<br>25th of april 1915<br>until you've stood on the beach at anzac<br>cove<br>we scrambled up through the gullies and<br>the trenches and we stood<br>on the ridge at chonak bear where we<br>could see the dardanelles in the far<br>distance<br>when we walked in the hill 60 and lone<br>pine cemeteries<br>it soon dawned on us that many of the<br>ages engraved on the headstones<br>were our age 22 years many were younger<br>to this day particularly on anzac day<br>those experiences<br>remind us to count our blessings so my<br>second word of advice<br>is to count your blessings every day<br>12 years later in 2002 i visited<br>antarctica<br>to observe tourism operations in the<br>ross sea region<br>i'd read all about the age of<br>exploration and was familiar with the<br>competing accounts<br>of scott's fateful polar expedition of<br>1910 to 1912.<br>i'd been convinced by roland huntford's<br>book the last place on earth<br>which portrays scott as incompetent when<br>compared<br>unfairly in many ways to his norwegian<br>polar counterparts<br>when i visited scott's head at cape<br>evans which is full of incredible<br>artifacts left there over a century ago<br>i was transported back in time i can<br>remember being alone in the hut<br>and half expecting a figure from the<br>past to open the hut door and walk back<br>in at any moment but the real eye-opener<br>for me<br>was when we flew up to the polar plateau<br>from a tiny speck of a helicopter i<br>looked down on the vast glaciers below<br>bear in mind that the beard more glass<br>here is 200 kilometers long<br>a labyrinth of yawning bottomless<br>crevasses<br>i tried to imagine anyone trying to haul<br>sledges up that mighty glacier<br>in such challenging conditions it was<br>both awesomely beautiful<br>and awesomely intimidating that forced<br>me to reconsider what i'd read<br>and i gained a whole new respect for all<br>of those early antarctic explorers<br>that experience reminds me to never rush<br>to judgment<br>so thirdly formulate your own views and<br>reach your own conclusions<br>but be cautious in your judgments until<br>you are confident<br>today you are graduating with more than<br>a degree<br>because of the certain qualities that<br>make otago graduates unique<br>otago graduates a product of products of<br>a university town<br>with a campus that's the envy of many<br>universities around the world<br>residential colleges and beautiful<br>architecture but you're also the product<br>of the so-called otago experience<br>in the final year of her geography<br>degree my daughter completed a really<br>interesting group research project<br>that addressed this question do otago<br>undergraduate students<br>still identify with the scafi culture 97<br>of the students they surveyed said that<br>they absolutely did<br>to students themselves that meant having<br>fun<br>enjoying yourselves together named flats<br>the hour of power cold flats<br>being constantly cold two minute noodles<br>probably cold the zoo<br>castle street helping each other and<br>making friends<br>these are aspects of the student<br>experience that are absolutely unique<br>to otago for me the last of these two<br>the two last of these points strike a<br>particular chord<br>i've worked at otago with many students<br>who have gone on to impressive careers<br>some have years later recounted little<br>things that i did to help them<br>things that i had long forgotten and<br>significant things<br>things that cost me absolutely nothing<br>other than perhaps a few minutes of my<br>day<br>i can say in all honesty hand on heart<br>that the highlights of my career at<br>otago have been celebrating the<br>successes<br>of students who i worked with and may<br>have helped a little bit along the way<br>it is a little known fact that otago<br>students offer help and contribute<br>enormously to the community while living<br>and studying in dunedin<br>i didn't realize that otago is the only<br>university in new zealand<br>where students organize a relay for life<br>last month student relay raised close to<br>110<br>000 dollars that is phenomenal<br>after the event it emerged that one<br>student ran over 100 kilometers during<br>the relay<br>the cancer society thanked him with a<br>forty dollar super<br>market voucher and a voucher for a<br>massage<br>no doubt he deserved that after running<br>a hundred k's<br>he immediately donated the vouchers to a<br>person at daffodil house who was<br>receiving cancer treatment<br>so fourthly keep helping others the help<br>that you offer will never be forgotten<br>help given is often repaid many times<br>over<br>in ways that you would never expect that<br>has certainly been my experience<br>otago has enriched my life in countless<br>ways but i think the thing i most value<br>is the lifelong friendships that i made<br>here as a student<br>a study from the warwick business school<br>published in 2008 found that the benefit<br>of having a good friend<br>from a happiness and life satisfaction<br>perfect perspective<br>is equivalent to an extra 85 000 pounds<br>in annual salary<br>that is an extraordinary figure but it<br>doesn't surprise me<br>i couldn't put a price on the<br>friendships that i made as a student<br>studying at otago so finally<br>treasure the friends that you've made<br>here if you're as lucky as i have been<br>they will add many layers of richness to<br>your life<br>seek out distant horizons and cherish<br>those that you attain<br>enjoy the journey and congratulations<br>professor heim i sincerely thank you for<br>your insightful<br>and compelling graduation address this<br>afternoon<br>the broad canvas of your address covered<br>not only helpful<br>and encouraging advice to our newest<br>graduates<br>but also informed by your own<br>scholarship and research<br>the significant challenges confronting<br>us in the 21st century<br>these require our graduates and
