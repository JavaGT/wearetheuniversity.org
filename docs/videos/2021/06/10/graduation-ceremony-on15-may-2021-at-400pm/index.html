to invite professor heim to deliver this
afternoon's
congratulations graduates on all of your
wonderful achievements
and congratulations to whanau and
friends who are celebrating with you
today
either here in person or from afar
a special shout out to those who have
overcome adversity to be here today you
know who you are
those who are the first in your family
to graduate with a university degree
and to our phd graduates who have
received the university's highest degree
today
and to my wife linda and eldest daughter
ali
graduates you are now part of only 6.7
percent of the population of the world
who have a university education that
figure
6.7 percent has an interesting tourism
parallel that is very important to the
future of the industry in aotearoa
since the late 1970s the global airline
industry has successfully recruited
100 million frequent flyers
yet it is estimated that only six or
seven percent of the global human
population
has ever flown in an airplane most of
the growth in global tourism in recent
decades has been driven
by increasing air travel demand in the
most wealthy societies
the uneven distribution of air travel
consumption also arises
within those societies in the us and the
uk
for example 70 percent of all flights
are consumed
by only 15 percent of the population
in a world threatened by climate change
the injustices of air travel have become
glaring
those who fly a lot contribute
disproportionately to climate change
which most impacts the most vulnerable
who never fly
flight shame could there should
therefore come as no surprise
something has to change and tourism
destinations will be challenged to
respond
of course this was all prior to the
covert pandemic and we know
that covert has changed to everything
you are the covered
generation of graduates well done you've
had to be very adaptable
in fact covert has forced upon us change
that
in many cases we knew was necessary and
overdue
so why did we wait for a crisis my first
word of encouragement is to be an agent
of positive change
every day use your education to
challenge the status quo
don't wait for a crisis it's
hard to talk about tourism to this
audience at this time
prior to covert graduation was a point
in time when many students headed off
overseas to take on the world
by denying us all the pandemic has
reminded us
just how important travel and tourism is
to us it's in our dna
quite literally unfortunately tourism
can be a destructive force
we have probably all seen tourism at its
worst in different places
but tourism can also be a very powerful
positive force it allows us to seek out
distant horizons
tourism at its best is about connecting
with people in place
allowing us to develop deep connections
and understandings
in 1989 linda and i graduated and headed
off on an oe
after work in the uk through the summer
of 1990 we headed off with our backpacks
to explore the continent
where we eventually made our way to
chanakali and then across the straits to
gallipoli
it is really difficult to imagine what
the anzacs faced on the morning of the
25th of april 1915
until you've stood on the beach at anzac
cove
we scrambled up through the gullies and
the trenches and we stood
on the ridge at chonak bear where we
could see the dardanelles in the far
distance
when we walked in the hill 60 and lone
pine cemeteries
it soon dawned on us that many of the
ages engraved on the headstones
were our age 22 years many were younger
to this day particularly on anzac day
those experiences
remind us to count our blessings so my
second word of advice
is to count your blessings every day
12 years later in 2002 i visited
antarctica
to observe tourism operations in the
ross sea region
i'd read all about the age of
exploration and was familiar with the
competing accounts
of scott's fateful polar expedition of
1910 to 1912.
i'd been convinced by roland huntford's
book the last place on earth
which portrays scott as incompetent when
compared
unfairly in many ways to his norwegian
polar counterparts
when i visited scott's head at cape
evans which is full of incredible
artifacts left there over a century ago
i was transported back in time i can
remember being alone in the hut
and half expecting a figure from the
past to open the hut door and walk back
in at any moment but the real eye-opener
for me
was when we flew up to the polar plateau
from a tiny speck of a helicopter i
looked down on the vast glaciers below
bear in mind that the beard more glass
here is 200 kilometers long
a labyrinth of yawning bottomless
crevasses
i tried to imagine anyone trying to haul
sledges up that mighty glacier
in such challenging conditions it was
both awesomely beautiful
and awesomely intimidating that forced
me to reconsider what i'd read
and i gained a whole new respect for all
of those early antarctic explorers
that experience reminds me to never rush
to judgment
so thirdly formulate your own views and
reach your own conclusions
but be cautious in your judgments until
you are confident
today you are graduating with more than
a degree
because of the certain qualities that
make otago graduates unique
otago graduates a product of products of
a university town
with a campus that's the envy of many
universities around the world
residential colleges and beautiful
architecture but you're also the product
of the so-called otago experience
in the final year of her geography
degree my daughter completed a really
interesting group research project
that addressed this question do otago
undergraduate students
still identify with the scafi culture 97
of the students they surveyed said that
they absolutely did
to students themselves that meant having
fun
enjoying yourselves together named flats
the hour of power cold flats
being constantly cold two minute noodles
probably cold the zoo
castle street helping each other and
making friends
these are aspects of the student
experience that are absolutely unique
to otago for me the last of these two
the two last of these points strike a
particular chord
i've worked at otago with many students
who have gone on to impressive careers
some have years later recounted little
things that i did to help them
things that i had long forgotten and
significant things
things that cost me absolutely nothing
other than perhaps a few minutes of my
day
i can say in all honesty hand on heart
that the highlights of my career at
otago have been celebrating the
successes
of students who i worked with and may
have helped a little bit along the way
it is a little known fact that otago
students offer help and contribute
enormously to the community while living
and studying in dunedin
i didn't realize that otago is the only
university in new zealand
where students organize a relay for life
last month student relay raised close to
110
000 dollars that is phenomenal
after the event it emerged that one
student ran over 100 kilometers during
the relay
the cancer society thanked him with a
forty dollar super
market voucher and a voucher for a
massage
no doubt he deserved that after running
a hundred k's
he immediately donated the vouchers to a
person at daffodil house who was
receiving cancer treatment
so fourthly keep helping others the help
that you offer will never be forgotten
help given is often repaid many times
over
in ways that you would never expect that
has certainly been my experience
otago has enriched my life in countless
ways but i think the thing i most value
is the lifelong friendships that i made
here as a student
a study from the warwick business school
published in 2008 found that the benefit
of having a good friend
from a happiness and life satisfaction
perfect perspective
is equivalent to an extra 85 000 pounds
in annual salary
that is an extraordinary figure but it
doesn't surprise me
i couldn't put a price on the
friendships that i made as a student
studying at otago so finally
treasure the friends that you've made
here if you're as lucky as i have been
they will add many layers of richness to
your life
seek out distant horizons and cherish
those that you attain
enjoy the journey and congratulations
professor heim i sincerely thank you for
your insightful
and compelling graduation address this
afternoon
the broad canvas of your address covered
not only helpful
and encouraging advice to our newest
graduates
but also informed by your own
scholarship and research
the significant challenges confronting
us in the 21st century
these require our graduates and our
community of scholars
to engage actively in addressing social
economic environmental and cultural
issues
which involve our shared humanity
you have also urged our graduates to
endeavor to be agents of
positive change on a daily basis
and to challenge existing paradigms and
attitudes
while participating in civil society
i also extend our congratulations to
your wife
and daughter on their graduations today
i invite you to join with me once again
and thanking professor haim
for his outstanding graduation
on behalf of the university council
i wish to thank the acting vice
chancellor professor helen nicholson
and our academic and professional staff
at all of the universities campuses
throughout new zealand
for their outstanding contribution to
ensuring our students benefit
from the emancipatory power of an
excellent
university education
thank you also to our staff for their
tireless work
during the covert 19 pandemic ensuring
that the university continues
to maintain its teaching research
and outreach programs the council was
very conscious
of the empathetic and collegial way that
all
staff have supported our students and
their colleagues
during the alert levels i invite you
to join with me in expressing our
appreciation
to you who have graduated or received
diplomas
i offer the congratulations of the
university on your new status
and i welcome you to its full and
permanent membership
i charge you by the common bond that now
unites us
henceforth to cherish the good name and
reputation
of the university and to strive for the
advancement of knowledge
and the extension of understanding
i trust that in your different vocations
your lives may be fruitful of good to
yourselves
on behalf of the university council i
thank you all
for sharing in the celebration
particularly those of you who have
traveled long distances to be
the academic anthem gowdy amis will now
be sung
the words are printed inside the back
cover of the graduation booklet
please stand for the answer and remain
standing as the academic procession
retires
you
