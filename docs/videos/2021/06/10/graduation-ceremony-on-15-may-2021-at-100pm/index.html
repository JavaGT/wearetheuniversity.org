thank you very much for that wonderful
performance
in 2005 the ayman cleric chair in our
studies was established at the
university of otago
in recognition of the rich scholarship
involving
irish history literature and culture
the current holder of the chair is
professor sonja tannen
originally from dublin professor tannen
graduated from the university college
dublin and was awarded a government
government of
ireland postgrad doctoral fellowship
which she completed at trinity college
dublin
she joined the university of otago in
2019
and is co-director of the center for
irish and scottish
studies professor tannen's research
interests are principally modern irish
history
with a focus on social and gender
politics
she has published widely in these areas
her most recent research is the study
irish and arteroa mapping the irish
community
and people of irish heritage in new
zealand
which was funded by the irish department
of foreign affairs this is the first
contemporary national project which aims
to record the number of irish-born
people
and people of irish heritage and with an
affinity for ireland
living in new zealand it is a very
impressive study
it gives me great pleasure to invite
professor sonya tannen
to deliver today's graduation address
tina tennocotto tenacoto tenekoto katoa
chancellor vice chancellor members of
council
colleagues graduates family and friends
in the words of the great irish poet
seamus heaney
who was much quoted in the american
presidential election last year
i strive for what he intended when
addressing students at harvard
university
i rise to rise to the occasion and not
disgrace my art or nation
for this indeed is a notable occasion
and i am deeply honored to have the
privilege to address you today
when considering what i could say that
may have a lasting
impact on you a task not to be taken
lightly
i reflected back to my own graduation
which was 13 years ago
and i have to admit i don't remember the
graduation speeches
so i thought instead what would i like
to have known that day
i was the first member of my family to
go to university
and graduating with a phd was certainly
a new experience for us all
i made sure to get extra tickets and
brought my parents my brother
my grandmother and they were
exceptionally proud
as i know all of your family friends and
colleagues
are of you today but it was years before
i appreciated exactly why they were so
proud
when i overheard my parents boasting to
their friends
they didn't mention what i studied how i
did in my exams
or what my dissertation focused on as a
family from a strong working-class
heritage
they're proud of how i navigated the
path to graduate
i returned to further education as a
mature student
through an outreach programme run by
university college dublin
i initially went to lectures in the
evening after a full day's work
running my own small cafe so of course i
struggled to pay bills and to manage
time
but i did manage and continued with
post-graduate studies through a
scholarship scheme
and this is what my parents remain proud
of today
the challenges i overcame are what i had
forgotten
by the day of my graduation while i sat
in a hall
not as decadent as this one it has to be
said
my thoughts were on my future where i
would go next
not on how i had got to that place i was
in a rush to move to the next stage
without taking time to fully appreciate
what i accomplished
this is what i would like you to take
away from today
an appreciation of what you have
accomplished
and how you got to this place for you
will all have faced
challenges in pursuit of your degrees
the path to graduating is not an easy
one
challenges come in all shapes and forms
some of you will have experienced
financial difficulties
struggled balancing family commitments
encountered health issues
work conflicts and for many people
experiencing self-doubt in their own
abilities
you as a graduating class this year
faced
extra challenges with the outbreak of a
global pandemic
you adjusted to a different way of study
often working in cramped conditions
shifting to online lectures and exams
zoom supervisory meetings
and navigating new ways to access
research
all the time with uncertainty in the
background
concern for a family perhaps in other
countries
or for the future but you all rose to
overcome these challenges
and now you sit here triumphant
you are among only a small number of
graduating classes from across the globe
that can safely come together with your
peers family
friends and lecturers to celebrate in
this way
this is a challenge that you overcame as
part of a much bigger team
across new zealand as prime minister
ardern calls team
5 million everyone in this room
and many more of your loved ones beyond
these walls
commend you but it is vital to remember
and to appreciate
that you did overcome these challenges
because life
is full of challenge and this is not a
bad thing
this is not a warning this is what makes
life
and living exciting when you face
challenges
in whatever path you next take remember
what you have already achieved
and always be mindful that others are
facing their own challenges
while i sat at my graduation i did not
dream that one day i would be standing
here speaking to you
on this occasion when i was offered this
position
myself and my wife charlotte embraced
the opportunity to travel to the other
side of the world
just less than two years ago it was a
challenge
but one that was proved to be worth
taking
the opportunity to live in this country
and research and teach irish studies at
the university of otago is an
extraordinary one
and highlights the way that education
can offer us new opportunities
and how education has the power to bring
communities
and countries closer together new
zealand
and ireland have extraordinary
connections and part of my work is to
highlight our collaborations
which is particularly important during
this global continuing global crisis
the importance of our connected
histories can be seen here today
with the singing of the new zealand
national anthem for that song was
written by irishman
thomas bracken deputy vice chancellor
professor tony valentine has researched
his extraordinary life
bracken was orphaned at a young age and
sent to family in australia
where he was put to work he emigrated to
new zealand in 1869
settling in dunedin he became a
journalist
a politician and a poet of some
distinction
often writing under the most irish of
pseudonyms paddy murphy
in 1876 his five stanza poem god defend
new zealand was set to music
and first sung on christmas night at a
concert in queens theatre
here in dunedin bracken undoubtedly
faced many harsh challenges
and circumstance led him to this place
where he excelled and forever left his
mark on this great nation
but my work has led me to research the
contemporary contemporary position of
the irish in new zealand
and the findings were published with a
forward by the president of ireland
michael d
higgins and this forward highlights the
value of academic scholarship
which has the power to enhance
cooperation
between our two small nations at this
difficult time
president higgins notes the strong
collaborations between
new zealand and ireland and advises how
new and ongoing challenges must now be
addressed
drawing on the best of the new morally
engaged scholarship
that values social cohesion and places
ethics at its core
as we continue to emerge from this
pandemic crisis
rebuilding shattered lives societies and
economies
we are doing so ever more mindful of our
interconnectedness
and our interdependence a point of
wisdom spelled out in the phrases of our
respective native languages
erska akala awareness
this new morally engaged scholarship the
president higgins holds so dear
is now in your hands it would be remiss
of me to end without quoting from
another great irish poet
and there are many to choose from but i
would like to use the words of one of my
favorites
for he is not only the president of
ireland but michael d higgins is also a
fine poet
when ireland was forced into lockdown in
march last year
president higgins made a national
address when he read one of his poems
titled take care which i hope
encompasses
my message to you today in the journey
to the light
the dark moments should not threaten
belief requires that you hold steady
bend if you will with the wind the tree
is your teacher
roots at once more firm from experience
in the soil made fragile
you're a gentle jew will come and a
stirring of power to go on towards the
space of sharing
gaurav mila maguev agus cohort just over
thank you and a huge congratulations to
you all thank you very much professor
tennant for your
engaging and moving graduation address
you have shared your story and touched
on the reality of the many challenges
that have arisen for today's graduates

global pandemic i know your words will
have encouraged them to reflect
on how they might continue to overcome
challenges
and how they might take advantage of
collaborative opportunities
which will come their way both during
their careers
and their wider lives also i wish to

for your significant engagement with the
community
