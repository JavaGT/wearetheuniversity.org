medicine i'm<br>assuming because you're watching this<br>video<br>so i'm here to tell you what is it like<br>to be a medical student<br>and come to otago university well<br>if you choose to come here and you get<br>in<br>you will discover that the medical<br>course is an<br>incredible journey through challenges<br>and experiences<br>that you will not even know you are<br>going to have at this point<br>that i can give you an outline about<br>what it's going to be like for you<br>and you can think about it and think is<br>this for me<br>and if it is put your application and<br>when<br>the time comes so what do you do when<br>you come to medical school well first of<br>all<br>if you're coming from school usually you<br>come to medical school via health<br>sciences first year so it's a really big<br>very pressured year where you get to do<br>lots of science stuff<br>and at the end of that some of you will<br>get into medicine<br>once you're in medicine the pressure is<br>a little bit less actually<br>because you're here we're not going to<br>throw you out unless you do something<br>very bad very naughty or you don't get<br>the marks so<br>most of you do get through it's not to<br>say it's a cruise<br>it is certainly not that you work jolly<br>hard<br>but you have an awesome time you learn<br>so much about what it means to be a<br>person<br>what it means to be a doctor and what it<br>means to be a patient<br>you will have a ball so first two years<br>you're in the university you're doing<br>what's called the early learning<br>medicine course<br>and that involves things like anatomy<br>biochemistry<br>a little bit pathology physiology<br>those sorts of things plus a course<br>called<br>early professional education now this<br>one is really important<br>because i tutor in it i know quite a bit<br>about it<br>and it's a really cool course which<br>teaches you<br>about how to become a doctor because<br>this is training you for a career which<br>is a<br>profession so there is a whole vast<br>range of things you've got to learn<br>about how to be a doctor<br>after third year you have the options of<br>doing a research year<br>you can also do a double degree in<br>arts you'll you can do a double degree<br>in science if you're that way inclined<br>and then come back into med school in<br>year four years four five and six of the<br>clinical years so these are the years<br>where you are attached to medical<br>teams and work with medical teams and<br>learn on the job rather like an<br>apprenticeship<br>at the same time though you have to be<br>responsible for a lot of<br>learning uh you have to do your own book<br>work and study work<br>and be very self-directional so the<br>people who succeed in medicine<br>are self-disciplined and are able to do<br>that self-directional work<br>after six years you then graduate and<br>then become a first-year health surgeon<br>and then a second year health surgeon<br>and from that point on<br>you can then choose specialisations so<br>it's a long course because if you decide<br>that you are going to specialise<br>and almost everyone does and general<br>practice is a specialization in<br>its own right most people are knocking<br>on 30 before they've actually finished<br>all the training they need to do so it's<br>not a lightweight<br>commitment however it's a fascinating<br>one and if you choose to do it<br>i don't think you'll be disappointed ah<br>kiara my name is sean i'm<br>a sixth year medical student this year<br>at the university of<br>otago i chose to<br>study medicine at otago because<br>well for a couple of reasons actually<br>it's really close to home for me so i<br>live in tiana<br>i really like dunedin and the fact that<br>it's such a<br>bustling community and it's really<br>vibrant um<br>and the medicine course itself as well<br>is<br>is um really good i've really enjoyed it<br>so far<br>um it's full of<br>i mean there's such a variety of things<br>that you get to do<br>so obviously you start with um with<br>health sciences<br>um first year so that's what i did and<br>then i went<br>through from health sciences first year<br>to just study medicine<br>and once you're in medicine you<br>basically have a bunch of different<br>subjects which<br>you need to study at the same time so<br>things like pharmacology<br>just the study of and drugs and how they<br>work<br>and medications and things like that<br>things like anatomy and the study of how<br>the body is made up<br>and then physiology how the body works<br>and<br>things like pathology and diseases and<br>things that can go wrong with the body<br>if that makes sense and<br>the variety for me is something that<br>keeps me<br>active all the time and i really enjoy<br>that<br>and then once you hit fourth year you do<br>your clinical years so you're based in<br>the hospital<br>and i really enjoy the fact that you get<br>to see<br>such a variety of different patients and<br>talk to so many different people from<br>all over the country and all over the<br>world</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
