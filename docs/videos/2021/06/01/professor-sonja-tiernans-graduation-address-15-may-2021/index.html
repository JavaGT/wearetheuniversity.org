council<br>colleagues<br>graduates family and friends<br>in the words of the great irish poet<br>seamus heaney<br>who was much quoted in the american<br>presidential election last year<br>i strive for what he intended when<br>addressing students at harvard<br>university<br>i rise to rise to the occasion and not<br>disgrace my art or nation<br>for this indeed is a notable occasion<br>and i am deeply honored to have the<br>privilege to address you today<br>when considering what i could say that<br>may have a lasting<br>impact on you a task not to be taken<br>lightly<br>i reflected back to my own graduation<br>which was 13 years ago<br>and i have to admit i don't remember the<br>graduation speeches<br>so i thought instead what would i like<br>to have known that day<br>i was the first member of my family to<br>go to university<br>and graduating with a phd was certainly<br>a new experience for us all<br>i made sure to get extra tickets and<br>brought my parents my brother<br>my grandmother and they were<br>exceptionally proud<br>as i know all of your family friends and<br>colleagues are<br>of you today but it was years before<br>i appreciated exactly why they were so<br>proud<br>when i overheard my parents boasting to<br>their friends<br>they didn't mention what i studied how i<br>did in my exams<br>or what my dissertation focused on as a<br>family from a strong working-class<br>heritage<br>they're proud of how i navigated the<br>path to graduate<br>i returned to further education as a<br>mature student<br>through an outreach programme run by<br>university college dublin<br>i initially went to lectures in the<br>evening after a full day's work<br>running my own small cafe so of course i<br>struggled to pay bills and to manage<br>time<br>but i did manage and continued with<br>postgraduate studies through the<br>scholarship scheme<br>and this is what my parents remain proud<br>of today<br>the challenges i overcame are what i had<br>forgotten<br>by the day of my graduation while i sat<br>in a hall<br>not as decadent as this one it has to be<br>said<br>my thoughts were on my future where i<br>would go next<br>not on how i had got to that place i was<br>in a rush to move to the next stage<br>without taking time to fully appreciate<br>what i accomplished<br>this is what i would like you to take<br>away from today<br>an appreciation of what you have<br>accomplished<br>and how you got to this place for you<br>will all have faced challenges<br>in pursuit of your degrees the path to<br>graduating is not<br>an easy one challenges come in all<br>shapes and forms some of you will have<br>experienced financial difficulties<br>struggled balancing family commitments<br>encountered health issues<br>work conflicts and for many people<br>experiencing self-doubt in their own<br>abilities<br>you as a graduating class this year<br>faced<br>extra challenges with the outbreak of a<br>global pandemic<br>you adjusted to a different way of study<br>often working in cramped conditions<br>shifting to online lectures and exams<br>zoom supervisory meetings and navigating<br>new ways to access research all the time<br>with uncertainty in the background<br>concern for a family perhaps in other<br>countries<br>or for the future but you all rose to<br>overcome these challenges<br>and now you sit here triumphant<br>you are among only a small number of<br>graduating classes from across the globe<br>that can safely come together with your<br>peers family<br>friends and lecturers to celebrate in<br>this way<br>this is a challenge that you overcame as<br>part of a much bigger team<br>across new zealand as prime minister<br>ardern calls team<br>5 million everyone in this room<br>and many more of your loved ones beyond<br>these walls<br>commend you but it is vital to remember<br>and to appreciate<br>that you did overcome these challenges<br>because life<br>is full of challenge and this is not a<br>bad thing<br>this is not a warning this is what makes<br>life<br>and living exciting when you face<br>challenges<br>in whatever path you next take remember<br>what you have already achieved<br>and always be mindful that others are<br>facing their own challenges<br>while i sat at my graduation i did not<br>dream that one day i would be standing<br>here speaking to you<br>on this occasion when i was offered this<br>position<br>myself and my wife charlotte embraced<br>the opportunity to travel to the other<br>side of the world<br>just less than two years ago it was a<br>challenge<br>but one that was proved to be worth<br>taking<br>the opportunity to live in this country<br>and research and teach irish<br>studies at the university of otago is an<br>extraordinary one<br>and highlights the way that education<br>can offer us new opportunities<br>and how education has the power to bring<br>communities<br>and countries closer together new<br>zealand and ireland have extraordinary<br>connections<br>and part of my work is to highlight our<br>collaborations<br>which is particularly important during<br>this global continuing global crisis<br>the importance of our connected<br>histories can be seen here today<br>with the singing of the new zealand<br>national anthem for that song was<br>written by<br>irishman thomas bracken deputy vice<br>chancellor professor tony valentine has<br>researched his extraordinary life<br>bracken was orphaned at a young age and<br>sent to family in australia<br>where he was put to work he emigrated to<br>new zealand in 1869<br>settling in dunedin he became a<br>journalist<br>a politician and a poet of some<br>distinction<br>often writing under the most irish of<br>pseudonyms paddy murphy<br>in 1876 his five stanza poem god defend<br>new zealand was set to music and first<br>song on christmas night<br>at a concert in queens theatre here in<br>dunedin<br>bracken undoubtedly faced many harsh<br>challenges<br>and circumstance led him to this place<br>where he excelled and forever left his<br>mark on this great nation<br>but my work has led me to research the<br>contemporary contemporary position of<br>the irish in new zealand<br>and the findings were published with a<br>forward by the president of ireland<br>michael d higgins and this forward<br>highlights the value of academic<br>scholarship<br>which has the power to enhance<br>cooperation<br>between our two small nations at this<br>difficult time<br>president higgins notes the strong<br>collaborations between<br>new zealand and ireland and advise us<br>how<br>new and ongoing challenges must now be<br>addressed<br>drawing on the best of the new morally<br>engaged scholarship<br>that values social cohesion and places<br>ethics at its core<br>as we continue to emerge from this<br>pandemic crisis<br>rebuilding shattered lives societies and<br>economies<br>we are doing so ever more mindful of our<br>interconnectedness<br>and our interdependence a point of<br>wisdom spelled out in the phrases of our<br>respective native languages<br>erska akala awareness<br>this new morally engaged scholarship the<br>president higgins holds so dear<br>is now in your hands it would be remiss<br>of me to end without quoting from<br>another great irish poet<br>and there are many to choose from but i<br>would like to use the words of one of my<br>favorites<br>for he is not only the president of<br>ireland but michael d higgins is also a<br>fine poet<br>when ireland was forced into lockdown in<br>march last year<br>president higgins made a national<br>address when he read one of his poems<br>titled<br>take care which i hope encompasses my<br>message to you today<br>in the journey to the light the dark<br>moments should not threaten<br>belief requires that you hold steady<br>bend if you will with the wind the tree<br>is your teacher<br>roots at once more firm from experience<br>in the soil made fragile<br>your gentle jew will come and a stirring<br>of power to go on towards the space of<br>sharing<br>gaurav mila marquez agus cohort just all<br>four<br>thank you and a huge congratulations to<br>you</p></main><footer
