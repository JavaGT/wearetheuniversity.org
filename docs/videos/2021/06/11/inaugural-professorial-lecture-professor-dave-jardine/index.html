to see so many people here i<br>wish you'd all come to the wednesday<br>grand rounds i wish we had a<br>an audience like this but welcome uh<br>we uh i'm going to tell you a little bit<br>about<br>um i guess how i came to be standing<br>here<br>it's not it's it's not all it's not all<br>about me i mean if it was about all<br>about me it would be a very long<br>talk uh so it's also about<br>colleagues friends family who have<br>helped me along the way um<br>the first thing i'd like to do we'd like<br>to do a waiata<br>so i want to introduce to my family i've<br>got my two daughters here<br>claudia and maddie and ruth my wife<br>and we also have two other<br>okay well dr cole won't be singing with<br>us but<br>um anyway we'll just that's that's fine<br>so um<br>i'd like to do the waiata now so ben can<br>and and you can join in by the way we'd<br>you get up job<br>away<br>oh<br>thanks for that um<br>so uh didn't were you singing okay okay<br>okay fine so um<br>yeah so this this talk that i'm supposed<br>to be doing<br>uh i've um<br>as i said it's not all it's not all<br>about me it's about the people who help<br>me along the way<br>and um i think you'll find it quite an<br>interesting story<br>uh<br>um yes so as i say it's about me<br>but there are a lot of people who help<br>me along the way so first of all<br>starting with my parents i was lucky<br>enough to have<br>to have two loving parents this is my<br>father jim<br>and my mother jan is here today she's<br>everyone<br>and and both of them took a real<br>interest in what i did<br>and um yeah uh you know you<br>it's very it's very difficult to thank<br>parents for all that they've done for<br>you over the years<br>uh as some of us will discover um this<br>is<br>um this this is just a shot to<br>to just to illustrate to you where they<br>came from this is a photo from hawke's<br>bay<br>they were both both my parents were upon<br>hawke's bay uh<br>and this is from the mahia peninsula and<br>this fishing was big there<br>um they were from what i would call the<br>like the post-war generation so their<br>parents were<br>involved in the great war which as you<br>know was probably the worst thing that<br>ever happened<br>to everyone and my this is one of my<br>grandfathers he came back and he was a<br>general practitioner in wairua northern<br>hawke's bay and i don't know what<br>happened when he came back to wairoa<br>but he this is a photo of the i think<br>the wairoa<br>city council or whoever it was you can<br>you can sort of see that then in hawke's<br>bay cross-dressing<br>and uh transvestism were accepted as<br>they are now<br>in hawke's bay uh this is the this is<br>where we grew up as kids this is a gut<br>this is the garden in rotorua which<br>which jim and jam put<br>a lot of work into and no photo uh<br>anywhere<br>ever does this garden justice you can<br>see um the lake behind it this beautiful<br>beautiful place<br>and jan's only just managed to drag<br>herself away from it<br>to go and live in auckland and every<br>every year in the blossom season that's<br>invaded by these huge<br>fat tuis that we will always remember<br>what did we do as kids well we sound on<br>the lake<br>um and<br>caught big fish yeah so this is uh this<br>is<br>uh my little sister sarah she didn't<br>become a nurse by the way she was just<br>you know<br>or whatever and and she got into this<br>photo as well she got in she gets into a<br>lot of photos<br>uh and we had great holidays up north<br>um then this is these are my other<br>sisters this is my older sister pip<br>who now lives in auckland and trained as<br>a lawyer and this is katie who's a<br>nurse in the royal melbourne we had<br>and and we also were lucky enough to go<br>on skiing holidays and then those<br>and the north islanders as you probably<br>are aware they ski on active volcanoes<br>this is what they do<br>and you can see we're all wearing<br>and um yeah that's that's that's some of<br>us with a random cousin<br>who i won't tell you about this is the<br>only member<br>uh my my siblings i haven't mentioned my<br>brother hamish who's a winemaker in<br>hawke's bay he's the only one of us who<br>ended up back in hawke's bay<br>um and in rotorua primary<br>we<br>yeah so in rotterdam primary we were a<br>bit outnumbered<br>uh we we were aware that we would we<br>perhaps looked a bit different from some<br>of our classmates but we were we were<br>very much included<br>we were taught an awful lot all our<br>teachers were married so we learned a<br>lot about<br>local history local custom and playing<br>rugby of course<br>when i got old enough i went to i was<br>lucky enough to go to university<br>um to this institution<br>uh and uh students where are the<br>students by the way<br>where are they are they here oh yes<br>they're here good so students in those<br>days<br>you could get this card here which<br>allowed you to fly<br>half price on any air fight any flight<br>within new zealand not overseas not to<br>the islands or you know not to australia<br>but you could<br>fly around new zealand and<br>of course you can't do that now okay<br>right um and this is a<br>this is a um student party in dunedin<br>um some i i would what i would um say<br>paul is although this this<br>does look a little bit uh disorderly a<br>lot of the a lot of the people in this<br>some of them um they've all they've all<br>actually they've all actually achieved<br>the ones that have survived have<br>achieved<br>and including some academics<br>um yes so and<br>eventually i uh about after a few years<br>as a student i managed to get into<br>medical school arthur morris and i<br>started off together in microbiology as<br>has been said<br>and uh after we uh we went to this we i<br>think we turned up at this big building<br>opposite<br>this is a actually this is a new photo<br>but uh<br>when arthur and i started this this was<br>a brand spanking new hospital<br>this was um you know about 1978 or<br>whatever but now of course it's going to<br>be taught that's going to be torn down<br>we we were we were such good um medical<br>students that<br>the uh dean of the medical school<br>allowed us time off to play<br>in the capping band which then was a<br>highly gifted group of musicians in fact<br>there's only one musician in this group<br>here and that is uh rob maxwell who's<br>also here today he was a clarinetist<br>it's amazing<br>how a good clarinet can carry 12 other<br>instrumentalists<br>students do you know this pub this is in<br>port chalmers<br>i hope you hope you don't know this pub<br>this is uh so again this was towards the<br>end of quite a big day<br>um these these uh this group of um of<br>instrumentalists<br>uh although we don't we've not been<br>asked to play at alumni<br>meetings we would very much like that<br>invitation<br>um and we still do low you know although<br>this is<br>rather unofficial we still do gather<br>every five years and<br>we we regard ourselves actually as great<br>uh also when i was a student i was lucky<br>enough to work for this man mark brown<br>mark is a nurseryman now in dunedin he<br>didn't like students<br>well he's quite an outspoken man and he<br>told me he didn't like students it<br>didn't help when i was late on the first<br>day of work<br>but i worked from for most the time i<br>was down there<br>and we agreed at the end of it that we<br>would go fishing<br>and when i started my first year in<br>invercargill i remember getting a bit<br>bogged down and mark just arrived<br>and said we are going fishing and we've<br>done that every year for the last 40<br>years<br>i was also lucky enough to have an<br>elective as a training intern and i went<br>to california<br>and i worked for richard thompson<br>here he is with his wife dusty and his<br>kids and dusty's parents<br>he was a general practitioner what they<br>call a family doctor and he was a<br>fantastic role model<br>and i still i still um managed to meet<br>up with him occasionally and he's a bit<br>of a musician as well he plays a squeeze<br>box<br>and then um as dave said i went to<br>england and this is the royal berkshire<br>hospital<br>i didn't know an awful lot about the<br>royal berkshire hospital<br>it's in reading which is on the m4 it's<br>got a very good orthopedic department i<br>think<br>um and the only thing i knew about it<br>was that<br>douglas barter had his legs cut off in<br>the in the<br>the royal barks so um kind of<br>kind of interesting uh so<br>um and i met i met a block called nick<br>sawyer who's also an excellent teacher<br>he was my<br>senior reg and we got on very well and<br>he encouraged me to carry on with<br>hospital medicine just to sort of try<br>and bring a little bit of science into<br>this talk<br>uh at that stage when we were in the<br>working in coronary care unit in reading<br>these we were recruiting patients for<br>these studies<br>and it's quite interesting just to think<br>about this because the isis one was<br>looking at atenolol a beta blocker<br>affecting for the first time survival in<br>hospital after an acute heart attack<br>this was the first drug<br>that had actually been shown to save<br>lives following an acute mi<br>and it was followed by the isis 2 study<br>which looked at aspirin and<br>streptokinase and that we were<br>recruiting for those studies then<br>up until then patients who came in for<br>their acute myes they were put in bed<br>they stayed in bed for about a week they<br>were given morphine and oxygen<br>and they had about a 10 in-hospital<br>mortality<br>also on the coronary care you know my my<br>this person and i remember as<br>a uh probably a little bit<br>up myself um senior house officer i<br>suggested to the nurse<br>that she might like to adjust the oxygen<br>on the patient<br>um and she said she wouldn't so<br>so i was that was a bit it was a bit<br>difficult for me<br>um so anyway i invited her out and we<br>got married about two years later<br>um in abingdon in the uk and<br>thereafter ruth actually she and<br>she encouraged me to do hospital<br>medicine she could see that i enjoyed it<br>i hadn't actually realized it myself and<br>she encouraged me to do teaching<br>and uh in return these were two huge<br>things for me<br>uh in return um i suggested to that new<br>zealand of all the places in the world<br>new zealand was the best place<br>to live and so i encouraged you to come<br>out to new zealand with me<br>and so then you see then i had to find a<br>hospital<br>that was you know that was attractive<br>you know a nice<br>modern looking hospital with a you know<br>with a<br>with a good sort of atmosphere about it<br>this was this was christchurch<br>hospital when we first came here and we<br>came back<br>um so this is actually where i think<br>parkside is today this<br>building's completely gone so we're<br>talking 1989 here<br>um and yeah<br>yes okay so christchurch hospital you<br>can see that the cars the cars are a<br>little bit stodgy aren't they<br>yeah 1980. and<br>in the hospital i might say although it<br>looks a bit<br>um boring there was a very good<br>registrar teaching program then<br>established by bridget robinson and<br>that's that teaching<br>program still exists today and so that<br>was the main attraction for coming back<br>in the hospital was this triad<br>that and this was my first job um so<br>this was the nephrology department and<br>um<br>yeah they were quite interesting they<br>sort of ruled they they ruled a lot of<br>things<br>they they they all they played cricket<br>except for richard which never played<br>qriket<br>um but this is um calvin lynn ross<br>bailey<br>and richard robson um and they were they<br>were<br>very very jealously looked after their<br>patients even when they were admitted<br>under general medicine they always came<br>and took them over<br>ross had a very good survival rate with<br>his transplants<br>but that was before peter seized and i<br>and he taught us a lot um he he taught<br>he took us to the races<br>um he taught us how to gamble on horses<br>um<br>and he um he had a very good taste in<br>tires some of you probably mostly don't<br>know about anything about this<br>uh and his wife lizzie actually gave me<br>a whole lot of his ties because she<br>wanted to get rid of them<br>and um he also taught me to write up<br>cases and so that's where i started<br>i started writing basically because of<br>ross<br>the other thing was that<br>kelvin apart from having the best hair<br>in the department<br>kelvin what peter seizes and i noticed<br>was that calvin often walked around with<br>a keyboard<br>and he was seen walking to the<br>outpatient's clinic to do a clinic with<br>this<br>keyboard well you know this was 1999 it<br>turned out he was using a computer<br>so we we laughed at him you know we<br>laughed at this and he snapped<br>he snapped and i remember he said to<br>peter he said<br>anyway things change ross bailey always<br>took a ninja to my health this is my<br>blood count that i had to do at some<br>stage and he uh<br>that's<br>that is his writing yeah so<br>he was the other person i met who ross<br>introduced me to was um steve chambers<br>steve was the new infectious disease the<br>only infectious diseases physician at<br>the time<br>uh and i went to work for him on ward 27<br>with irie where's iri so ahri so we were<br>i think we're the only ones here<br>so um so we worked on 27 and<br>by that stage uh it was about 10 years<br>since the start of the aids epidemic<br>so um i'd seen the start of it when i<br>was in america but it took 10 years to<br>get here when it got here<br>10 beds on board 27 were<br>in stage hiv patients<br>and they received amazing care from<br>from steve i learned a lot from him and<br>that was a very sad time but um very<br>very stimulating time um what i then i<br>then thought well there must be another<br>hospital that i've got to go and work in<br>you know i've worked in christchurch for<br>a while<br>i wanted to go somewhere a bit more<br>glamorous so<br>um down the road in kashmir which is a<br>sort of a more should we say a more<br>fashionable part of christchurch<br>this was this late art deco building<br>that we<br>that we worked in it had most of the<br>medicine actually most of the medicine<br>was done in<br>in those days at pmh uh and the cars<br>were a little bit more<br>upmarket i don't even know if that's the<br>right car actually i'm moving on hamburg<br>and i i then i i work for professor<br>hamer dukram who's with us here today<br>and ian crozier whose usual is down the<br>back<br>and they taught me they sort of got me<br>into invasive cardiology catheter work<br>pacemakers all sorts of interesting<br>things echo cardiography<br>and it was great that was my advanced<br>training when hammered found out i got<br>the exam he said<br>excellent jardine now the work starts<br>so so that was what we did<br>and he had been working with eric espina<br>and um gary nichols<br>on heart failure and uh<br>the there was a lot of work going into<br>the<br>green ninja tension system at that stage<br>but also<br>um we started thinking about sympathetic<br>activation and heart failure and that<br>was where<br>a lot of research was heading so<br>i hadn't really concentrated much on the<br>sympathetic nervous system and i'm not<br>going to try and explain to it to you<br>because i just haven't got the time<br>but uh it's it's really a very clever<br>system of nerves that that sort of runs<br>throughout the body that controls things<br>that we only have sort of partial<br>conscious control over and these are<br>things like sweating<br>blood flow to muscles um lots of lots of<br>sort of different things<br>and it's always or often in opposition<br>to<br>the vagus which sort of acts against it<br>so our lives are governed<br>by these two nervous systems that we<br>don't really have much<br>control over the sympathetic nervous<br>system why is it called the sympathetic<br>nervous system it's a difficult one<br>i don't know why um it was thought when<br>that when the anatomists first saw these<br>little sympathetic nerves going out to<br>all the different organs<br>they thought that these nerves were sort<br>of acting sympathetically with each<br>other to control<br>body parts and so i think that's how it<br>got it got its name<br>um whereas the vagus vagus is<br>a wanderer so this vagus nerve goes<br>everywhere throughout the body<br>and tends to counteract the things that<br>the sympathetic nervous system does<br>so how do i explain this so um the vega<br>this this is a dog this is a vagal<br>looking dog all right<br>so relaxed um probably just eaten a meal<br>because the vegas helps us eat and<br>digest things maybe just about to go to<br>sleep vegas helps us sleep everything's<br>nice and relaxed and that's the vegas<br>right<br>this is a sympathetic dog this is a<br>sympathetically charged dog<br>and these are the two nervous systems<br>that work in in opposition to each other<br>most of the time<br>um and um but but probably from my point<br>of view the interesting thing was that<br>this sympathetic nervous system most of<br>it<br>actually is in the spine rather than the<br>brain but it actually controls<br>um all of the arteries and the veins in<br>the body so what it does is it<br>these little nerves when we for example<br>when we stand up and when we exercise<br>when we do things<br>they have the ability to regulate the<br>flow to different parts of the body they<br>can tighten up the arteries and tighten<br>up the veins<br>or they can relax so our veins and<br>arteries are constantly<br>under the control of these little<br>sympathetic nerves they're quite useful<br>things<br>and the important uh chemical or<br>transmitter<br>at the end of this these sympathetic<br>nerves that act on the arteries and the<br>veins<br>is noradrenaline which sounds a bit like<br>adrenaline doesn't it and it's<br>essentially<br>it's quite similar it's like a stress a<br>stress hormone you need it when you're<br>either for fight or for flight as they<br>say<br>and so you need this these sympathetic<br>nerves with this noradrenaline<br>yes anyway so then i was interested<br>in articles that looked at control of<br>these of these nervous systems<br>the vagus and the sympathetic<br>particularly um the articles from iowa<br>this<br>is um an article that caught the<br>francois abud was the author<br>and and he described how these news were<br>controlled and the control system<br>um is quite interesting<br>as i say the nerves control these little<br>sympathetic nerves control the arteries<br>and the veins<br>and how tight they are and how how how<br>much they constrict down and how much<br>they expand<br>and these these are of course the<br>arteries are all through the body so the<br>nerves run<br>all through the body yep and they're<br>controlled by<br>a feedback system all right uh and there<br>are little pressure receptors<br>in our big arteries that are constantly<br>uh if you like reading the blood<br>pressure reading<br>the pressure of the blood inside our<br>arteries and feeding back<br>to the nervous system into the spine and<br>then<br>regulating these blood vessels so if the<br>pressure is going up<br>these things sense it and they send<br>signals to<br>relax the blood vessels and keep the<br>pressure everything is designed to try<br>and keep the pressure<br>uh constant very clever system<br>we also read about this man um<br>barcraft henry barcraft he did quite<br>interesting experiments on his medical<br>students<br>which hamilton and i thought would be<br>quite interesting to do but<br>we didn't he he basically<br>sat them in a chair and bled them until<br>they fainted<br>um the reason you may ask why do this<br>well he noticed that<br>in airaid casualties in the second world<br>war that when patients were bleeding to<br>death<br>the sympathetic nervous system could<br>hold the blood pressure<br>for so long and then it just seemed to<br>die it could it could maintain blood<br>pressure for so long<br>but then not and likewise the heart rate<br>would increase while the patient was<br>bleeding<br>and then not and what what barcroft<br>decided was that what you know when the<br>sympathetic nervous system<br>gave up all the blood vessels just<br>relaxed and<br>we vasodilated which is just really what<br>you don't want to do but that was his<br>theory<br>so what we what we did was we basically<br>tilted patients<br>and the human the human being you don't<br>actually have to bleed a human being to<br>make them faint<br>as we all know um you can have to stand<br>you can stand in a hot room<br>for too long lecturing to people<br>um which i have seen happen by the way<br>um the reason that we<br>we're the only animals who faint and the<br>reason we faint is because we can pull a<br>lot of blood on our legs<br>we've got quite muscly legs compared to<br>other animals<br>a dog never faints because it can't it<br>just hasn't got the<br>the muscle bulk in its legs for the<br>blood to pull into<br>so it's a uniquely human condition and<br>so essentially that was what<br>um ian crozier and and hamilton and i<br>did we set up this<br>model where we tilted patients<br>especially patients with a fainting<br>tendency<br>recorded their blood pressure and<br>with particular interest as to what<br>happened at the time that the system<br>collapsed in other words when<br>they fainted and the brain switched off<br>so these graphs can be a little bit<br>difficult to read i'm not going to<br>get too carried away here but what i<br>want the the the shaded columns are<br>people who faint and can you see that<br>after a certain length of time<br>so here they are they get tilted up<br>about here they get tilted<br>sorry go back they get tilted and then<br>after a certain length of time um<br>they faint uh and that's the fainting<br>point there can you see the blood<br>pressure there has dropped<br>to about 60 and we're all about the same<br>if our mean blood pressure falls to 60<br>we all faint<br>we're all the same and and the heart<br>rate tends to fall as well<br>and what we noticed we were measuring<br>just about every<br>neuroendocrine hormone known to man on<br>these in these patients we noticed<br>that the the noradrenaline level you<br>know at the time<br>of the faint it seemed to actually drop<br>so so this would suggest that our<br>sympathetic nerves were failing us<br>you know there was less sympathetic<br>nerve activity there was less<br>noradrenaline leaking out into the blood<br>and it was failing us just when we<br>needed it when our blood pressure was<br>falling<br>and so we went back to the think tank<br>our saturday morning research meetings<br>and we we didn't see a vasodilation in<br>these patients<br>uh there was this fallen noradrenaline<br>and so we decided we needed a better way<br>to actually monitor the sympathetic<br>nerve activity that meant actually<br>recording the nerves directly<br>yes so that that was a big that was<br>quite a big decision<br>guna waleen um was the father of<br>of nerve recordings and he was swedish<br>and he had recently<br>visited um australia and he he worked<br>with this man murray isla who is like<br>the um he's mr sympathetic nervous<br>system<br>he works in the baker institute uh and<br>i went to hammond let me go and work in<br>his laboratory for a few weeks and i<br>learned this<br>quite difficult technique of recording<br>sympathetic nerves<br>so um we use this nerve simply because<br>it's easiest to get at and this is<br>called the perineal nerve and it's just<br>behind the knee<br>just here so um and we do it on an awake<br>patient so it's not a<br>particularly pleasant thing to do to<br>someone to stick a needle in their nerve<br>um so i went and looked at a few dead<br>bodies first to make sure i knew where<br>the nerve was<br>um and yes put the needles in the<br>trouble with the nerve is it carries not<br>only sympathetic<br>fibers but it carries you know motor<br>fibers to work the muscles and sensory<br>fibers to<br>take sensation from the skin it takes a<br>whole lot of different nerve fibers not<br>just the ones that i wanted<br>so it was quite a technique to find<br>these nerves<br>and i used this as a an iowa nerve<br>traffic analyzer don't ask me how it<br>works you just<br>plug the needle in and it amplifies it<br>and then<br>rectifies it and integrates it and you<br>end up with a nerve signal<br>and so what i want to do is i just want<br>to show you this nerve signal because<br>this is one of the major things that<br>i sort of became a little bit obsessed<br>with<br>for a number of years and i want to play<br>you what the what these sympathetic<br>nerves<br>sound like<br>see that they sort of come and go see<br>that<br>so i could i could listen to that all<br>day now<br>are you ex are you all excited by this i<br>can see you ah<br>so anyway moving on so um but that these<br>are the nerves that that basically<br>vasoconstrict uh blood vessels in our<br>bodies and and allow us to maintain a<br>constant blood pressure when<br>we suddenly stand up and all the blood<br>starts pulling in our legs<br>so i'm going to show you very quickly<br>some recordings so um<br>these are these are obviously not moves<br>they're still shots this is a blood<br>pressure tracing<br>and we recorded every every heartbeat<br>these are this is continuous blood<br>pressure over about a minute can you see<br>that this is someone lying down<br>and this is their sympathetic nerve<br>activity<br>all right and this is their ecg which is<br>just monitoring their heart rate<br>and then you stand them up right and can<br>you see<br>the the blood pressure becomes it stays<br>the same but it becomes a bit more<br>variable<br>and these nerves really take off all<br>right and they take off<br>really quickly um this is because this<br>system is so fast you know the the the<br>barrow<br>receptors can pick up the sudden change<br>and this is just showing you this is<br>someone who's<br>um yeah who's lying down and then going<br>to a standing position and this is how<br>quickly these nerves kick in can you see<br>that<br>when you're lying down there just<br>cruising along that nicely and then<br>this system is really quick and this is<br>what this is what keeps us<br>conscious when we stand up and it's so<br>fast that even if if you have like an<br>extra beat like we all have ectopic<br>beats from time to time you know extra<br>powerful heartbeats that we feel and<br>when that happens there is usually a bit<br>of a pause between heartbeats<br>and during that pause can you see blood<br>pressure falls quite low<br>and look at these bursts these bursts<br>come in straight away these big powerful<br>bursts to try and keep the blood<br>pressure<br>up but what happens during a faint well<br>here it is so this is about two minutes<br>before a faint this is the blood<br>pressure here<br>you can see the blood pressure gets<br>quite variable and then it<br>falls down and the patient becomes<br>unconscious at this point<br>and these nerves can you see they<br>actually conk out they conk out when we<br>really need them<br>yeah not only that but sometimes the<br>heart conks out as well<br>so um again you would expect the heart<br>rate to increase when the blood pressure<br>but in this person who fainted and was<br>unconscious<br>for i think about a minute um the heart<br>stopped<br>for about 30 seconds we see this<br>occasionally usually in young people<br>but 30 seconds is quite a long time<br>watching a monitor<br>when you've had a well patient you know<br>on the tilt table<br>you started off with a well-patient and<br>then they're a systolic<br>um anyway hammered was fine with it so<br>you know so we we did these experiments<br>um and we we<br>of course what we wanted to do was get a<br>series of patients and look at<br>what the nerve activity did um this this<br>is just<br>showing you blood pressure again falling<br>and someone who's fainting<br>heart rate falls but always after blood<br>pressure it's always a late event<br>it doesn't cause the fall and blood<br>pressure<br>and nerve activity does fall but it<br>doesn't fall<br>early and this was the big puzzle<br>because we thought well yes the blood<br>pressure's falling<br>but we would expect that the nerve<br>activity to fall off<br>before the blood pressure fell because<br>we thought we assumed that the nerve<br>activity was controlling blood pressure<br>this was quite interesting and also<br>again there was no vasodilation we were<br>looking for the phase of citation in the<br>arms<br>and uh didn't see it so it was some<br>yeah kind of odd just to show you that<br>yeah that the<br>the um the blood pressure was falling<br>before the nerve activity<br>so we were a bit puzzled what why was<br>the blood pressure falling<br>it didn't seem to be vasodilation it<br>didn't seem to be a change in the heart<br>rate<br>and it turns out um it was due to a<br>fallen cardiac output and it wasn't<br>stroke volume it was actually it wasn't<br>um right it was actually stroke volume<br>and um yeah so cardiac output was<br>falling<br>several minutes before the faint and we<br>to do these these experiments we had to<br>measure cardiac output each minute<br>um during uh tilt table testing which<br>was also<br>quite difficult and this is just to show<br>you that yes as cardiac output falls<br>this is several minutes before the faint<br>you can see patient is they're not<br>actually vasodilating the cardiac output<br>and the stroke volume are falling<br>and the reason that stroke volume is<br>falling is because all the blood is<br>sitting in these big saggy veins<br>what we tend to forget is that most of<br>our blood at any point in time is<br>actually in the veins<br>in other words the little vessels that<br>bring the blood back to the heart<br>yes and so as humans when we stand up we<br>get a lot of this pooling<br>and so eventually if we stand for too<br>long or the room's too hot<br>or we're in a spa pool and we suddenly<br>stand up all the blood just seems to sit<br>in these veins<br>and cardiac output falls and we faint<br>that's probably the mechanism these<br>veins do have nerve they do have<br>sympathetic nerve supply<br>so there is some sympathetic nerve<br>control over them but obviously not<br>enough<br>in some of us to prevent us from pulling<br>blood and from fainting<br>and this is work done by julian stewart<br>in new york who showed that all the<br>blood<br>guts right in the gut all the blood's<br>pulling here some in the legs but mainly<br>all right so um and it's most important<br>that this blood supply in the gut is<br>under control and this is just to show<br>you<br>the extent of sympathetic nerve<br>innervation of the gut there are a<br>huge number of sympathetic nerves<br>controlling blood flow in our gut<br>100 million neurons the only other organ<br>in the body that has more neurons than<br>that<br>is the brain so a lot of physiologists<br>call<br>the gut the second brain so i believe i<br>i think that um these<br>uh nerves are under sympathetic control<br>but of course<br>um it may be that that fainters have<br>slightly set more saggy veins maybe<br>other reasons as to why they faint<br>uh and with these two uh gentlemen water<br>wheeling who's in amsterdam<br>and julian stewart we've um worked out a<br>an explanation<br>our explanation for uh fainting in these<br>individuals<br>so ah they're veins veins are under<br>control and um which reminds me of a<br>song<br>um and claudia i'm gonna ask you to<br>sing us what's the name of the song<br>um<br>you're good i'm pleased to learn the<br>control<br>i don't want to change<br>um while this was happening i went to<br>hospital<br>and i was um there for five years this<br>is the timber hospital cricket team<br>um i was in automatic selection for this<br>team because i played in the<br>christchurch<br>hospital team<br>well i think we played um two games i'm<br>not sure how many um<br>one of the things i had to do when i was<br>hammers registrar was organise<br>the indoor cricket team at that stage<br>our indoor cricket teams were sponsored<br>by drug companies<br>and astrazeneca the makers of atenolol<br>were very keen to sponsor us<br>but hamad didn't didn't want them<br>because they wanted us to be called the<br>beta blockers<br>so that wasn't you know that wasn't<br>really his<br>way he was more of a an aggressive<br>batsman so um<br>the other the competing uh drug company<br>was bayer bayer pharmaceuticals<br>and uh at that stage their drug was<br>knifing [ __ ] but we didn't really want<br>so anyway we were in timaru and this is<br>my son max who's not here today he might<br>be<br>zooming you know we're missing you max<br>he max has always been the philosopher<br>of the family and<br>um in into meru he actually wrote a<br>little<br>sort of like a diary of what we were<br>doing and it sort of<br>reminded me a little bit of how hectic<br>it was being in timaru<br>and you know coming up to christchurch<br>on a regular basis<br>so um this is this is a special book dad<br>got a special book about hearts<br>um my mom's coming back then dad is<br>going to christchurch to a meeting<br>then he's coming back and then it's<br>going to be claudia's<br>claudia's birthday she's going to be two<br>at the start of the year i'll be six and<br>dad will be 41. that was that's actually<br>right that's right<br>bunsey the dog will be three keith will<br>be 10 and the house will be nine years<br>so anyway so we decided we should come<br>back to christchurch and have chickens<br>we had a lot of chickens um other<br>people's chickens moved in with us as<br>well chickens we didn't want<br>um but then i thinking about this i was<br>thinking more about this<br>nervous system how much how much longer<br>am i running out of time<br>i've got hopefully a bit more time<br>so i wanted to see how the system could<br>be affected by disease that was the next<br>thing<br>so um because as you can see i was sort<br>of you know i was really keen on the<br>system and the way it controlled<br>sympathetic nerves<br>but also of course higher centers can<br>affect the sympathetic nervous system<br>and there are pathways from the brain<br>going down and controlling our<br>sympathetic nerves which live in the<br>spine<br>and so that meant experimenting on<br>registrars<br>um uh and here you can see a very<br>uh willing um registrar christina who<br>was<br>um this is what we call the cold presser<br>test where you put the hand into ice<br>it's pretty uncomfortable and you watch<br>the blood pressure go up<br>and the blood pressure of course is<br>being driven up by these nerves<br>even more unpleasant is if you put ice<br>on your face and that's that's the<br>diving reflex<br>which i also which christina also uh<br>volunteered for<br>she did so and here she is so the ice<br>goes on to the face<br>um i think about here uh and can you see<br>can you see the the nerves just the<br>sympathetic nerves just take off<br>and drive the blood pressure up right<br>and also<br>what's interesting at the same time the<br>heart slows down<br>remember these are the nerves that are<br>meant to stimulate the heart and<br>increase the heart rate but what's<br>happening here is the vagus<br>the vagus is coming in and actually<br>firing at the same time as sympathetic<br>nerves so it's<br>sort of an interesting reflex and it's a<br>very primitive reflex all the animals<br>all the<br>mammals have got it birds whales dive<br>down<br>slow their heart down while they're<br>foraging around on the<br>looking for whatever they what are they<br>feet<br>krill yeah so whales have got this<br>reflex and they use it to their<br>advantage<br>um i don't know what the advantage is in<br>humans<br>so anyway it's interesting vagus and<br>sympathetic acting together<br>also if you happen to be recording the<br>sympathetic nerves as we were during<br>this was during a tilt test<br>the patient has a seizure right what<br>happens then<br>so we're not talking about a faint here<br>we're talking about you know a sudden<br>electrical discharge from the brain<br>quite a different reason to lose<br>consciousness and this patient<br>while we were recording happened to have<br>what we call<br>a partial seizure so that's not all the<br>jerking of the arms and the legs because<br>that would have meant the the experiment<br>would have been<br>destroyed um i would have lost all the<br>recordings but this<br>this patient just went slightly detached<br>and a bit unconscious and had what we<br>call a sort of a partial seizure<br>but while this happened can you see his<br>blood pressure just went absolutely<br>through the roof<br>and it was sort of triggered by a<br>discharge of these sympathetic nerves so<br>this was<br>presumably an electrical discharge in<br>the in the brain that was affecting<br>the sympathetic nerves in the spine this<br>is the only recording of sympathetic<br>nerves<br>i also had a glider pilot who was coming<br>in to land in his<br>in his pilot and he fainted as the<br>glider<br>landed so he allowed me to do a tilt<br>test on him and he fainted during the<br>tilt test<br>which was good um but while he was<br>recovering from the faint and this is<br>his blood pressure recovering he told me<br>he was getting these<br>bursts of electric current he could<br>actually feel the um the the<br>uh the nervous activity bursts of<br>nervous activity<br>um going down his legs and they were<br>they were these were bursts of<br>sympathetic<br>huge bursts of sympathetic activity and<br>can you see that they were slightly<br>driving his blood pressure up each time<br>that was kind of interesting and then we<br>had<br>other patients this patient had a had a<br>stroke this stroke<br>affected the feedback pathways from the<br>barrier reflexes into the brain<br>and basically what happened was there<br>was no feedback so the sympathetic<br>nerves just went completely<br>up yep and just very a lot of<br>sympathetic<br>discharge can you see that he's got like<br>a nerve burst with every heartbeat<br>my registrar said to me this man's had a<br>stroke but he looks like he's<br>he's got a pheochromocytoma because he's<br>just sweating and he's just got this<br>awful blood pressure and<br>in a sense it was sort of like a fio<br>it's just that it was it was sympathetic<br>nerve activity out of control<br>uh and another man who had a who had<br>radiotherapy after a brain tumor had the<br>same sort of thing<br>um too much sympathetic nerve activity<br>when these pathways<br>are interfered with and we we saw it<br>also in other patients<br>other cancer patients and this was a<br>patient of bridget robinson's<br>who had a paraneoplastic syndrome and<br>problems with<br>the barrier reflex pathways and too much<br>nerve activity<br>and another man with porphyria and<br>porphyria is<br>um porphyria is just a condition where<br>the<br>breakdown products of hemoglobin<br>hemoglobin synthesis are released into<br>the blood and they<br>are neurotoxins all right so<br>you've probably heard of there are very<br>i think there were various royal<br>members of the royal family who meant to<br>have had porphyria and various famous<br>people<br>um and they can go mad and it's because<br>um the porphyrins are neurotoxins and uh<br>yes so he and and this patient this is<br>when he had recovered from his attack of<br>porphyria and this was during you can<br>see his<br>his nerve activity is is is uh much<br>greater<br>and the the only other time when we were<br>able to see<br>um that the heart that you could<br>actually stop the heart<br>so during a faint we'd seen this during<br>a severe faint<br>was this maneuver which is um<br>carotid sinus what we call carotid sinus<br>massage where you actually<br>massage the vagus in the neck<br>and for those of you who are star trek<br>fans you'll be aware that mr spock used<br>this maneuver on a number of<br>people i think aliens as well as humans<br>and if you massage the neck<br>you can in some patients you can stop<br>the heart<br>right not only do you stop the heart but<br>you also stop the sympathetic nerves<br>yeah so spock<br>he was onto it that was good um<br>but i wanted to find out more about the<br>heart and this takes me to<br>the studies that we did here on sheep<br>you can't<br>study sympathetic nerves supplying the<br>heart and a human<br>you would not get that through an ethics<br>committee<br>i don't think and so i knew that there<br>was a group here led by professor mark<br>richards<br>professor chris charles and miriam<br>rademaker they were studying<br>they had a heart failure model in sheep<br>and these sheep were recorded on the<br>third floor of our medical school here's<br>a sheep<br>having its heart recorded but what i<br>wanted to do was try and record its<br>sympathetic the sympathetic nerve supply<br>to the heart<br>so the heart also has these sympathetic<br>nerves going to<br>regulating the heart rate how strongly<br>it pumps<br>yes but to do that i first had to go to<br>australia again i had to go back and<br>to the howard flora unit here and i met<br>these two<br>men who were very helpful clive may and<br>um robin mcellen who's robin's an<br>electrophysiologist you can see he's<br>laughing in this photo because<br>when i arrived i arrived with my nerve<br>traffic analyzer that i'd taken as hand<br>luggage on the plane<br>i didn't want to put it in the luggage<br>part of the plane<br>he thought that was hilarious and anyway<br>he he sorted out<br>we used the human recording system that<br>we'd used on<br>all the humans in new zealand we<br>so to find these little sympathetic<br>nerves it was difficult because they're<br>not big<br>they run from the spinal cord to the<br>heart that's that's a photo of a sheep<br>heart which we<br>found from an atlas in the basement of<br>the howard flora unit<br>these are the little electrodes we used<br>you need to make the electrodes longer<br>obviously so they can<br>go from the skin into the thorax of the<br>animal these are quite tricky and<br>they're quite tricky to make<br>and the nerves the nerves are small and<br>basically<br>invisible without an operating<br>microscope so<br>i had to we had to get an operating<br>microscope to do that<br>this is the aorta and this is the heart<br>and these are the nerves<br>so um and to stick the to stick the<br>needle in the nerve and to hold it there<br>we use super glue yeah<br>so that the system was that chris<br>charles and i worked out<br>um was that um chris would do the<br>anesthetic on the animal<br>uh where is it where is he yeah he would<br>do the anesthetic<br>then he would um perform the operation<br>of thoracotomy<br>um and then i would sort of breathe in<br>uh about an hour later or two hours<br>later and stick these needles in the<br>nerve and then breeze out and then he<br>would do everything<br>and um that was that was sort of<br>partly how it went and then the and then<br>it would be<br>monarch this ship would be monitored by<br>this is mel forester who was our<br>technician at the time but later rachel<br>aston and<br>the sheep would recover from the<br>operation<br>and we would record uh for about two<br>weeks<br>um and as you can imagine not all<br>recordings worked because this is this<br>is quite difficult practically difficult<br>but we we got what we got was<br>sympathetic nerve activity directed to<br>the heart and this was really exciting<br>we hadn't there hadn't been recordings<br>of this nature in a large animal in a<br>large conscious animal before<br>so here it is it just looks like human<br>sympathetic nerve activity<br>can you see that and when you drop the<br>blood pressure by giving the animal<br>a drug to drop blood pressure can you<br>see the bursts increase so it was<br>controlled just like just like our<br>sympathetic nerves we're no different<br>from sheep<br>in this regard<br>and yes you can block these nerves with<br>clever drugs and when you block the<br>sympathetic nerves at the ganglia<br>they give out so this was just showing<br>the other thing that we noticed<br>with these animals that if you gave the<br>sheep a heart attack<br>was that sympathetic nerve activity<br>increased<br>so this is this is an animal before the<br>before the heart attack immediately<br>afterwards and then a few days later and<br>can you see<br>that if you look at these different<br>panels the sympathetic nerve activity is<br>increasing<br>so now we had um you know a sort of a<br>model for<br>how sympathetic nerve activity increased<br>following a heart attack and why<br>drugs like atenolol might be quite<br>useful because we the general thought is<br>that sympathetic activity is bad for the<br>heart<br>too much sympathetic activity is bad<br>makes the heart<br>have funny rhythms drives the blood<br>pressure up increases the work the heart<br>has to do<br>yep and so we this just summarizes that<br>work showing how sympathetic nerve<br>activity increased in a number of<br>um animals after a heart attack uh and<br>then some of the animals<br>they like humans um when they have the<br>heart attack they suddenly die<br>and the common time to die following a<br>heart attack is within an hour or two<br>and some animals actually did this and<br>this is one such animal<br>here's the sympathetic nerve activity<br>the heart attack occurs here<br>and this is about 30 minutes later can<br>you see there's a sudden<br>increase in sympathetic nerve activity<br>and then<br>fatal arrhythmia so<br>we we looked at a number of animals and<br>but we found that there wasn't a<br>dramatic increase<br>in the and the number of bursts um<br>but the burst size seemed to increase in<br>animals<br>who were if you like susceptible to<br>having these arrhythmias<br>yeah so um<br>we also noticed that um when you give<br>the animal<br>uh certain drugs uh this is baseline<br>activity<br>atropine is commonly used in our<br>coronary care units to speed the heart<br>up when it's going too slowly<br>and that it does increase some<br>sympathetic nerve activity of the heart<br>quite interesting and even good old<br>atenolol when you give a tennolol<br>you drop blood pressure and sympathetic<br>nerves<br>try to act to counteract that so you<br>actually increase sympathetic nerve<br>activity to the heart<br>when you give the animal a beta blocker<br>it's a bit scary isn't it because<br>but we were giving beta blockers to all<br>of our patients in coronary care<br>but the reason that a tennile protects<br>or did protect these patients is because<br>it's blocked all the the receptors<br>in the heart itself so this increased<br>one thing we did find uh we looked<br>around for certain hormones and drugs<br>that could actually decrease this<br>cardiac sympathetic nerve activity and<br>we found a hormone which is called<br>urocortin<br>which if you give it to an animal it<br>actually over time<br>it actually decreases cardiac nerve<br>activity and this was quite exciting<br>because we thought well this could be a<br>form of treatment<br>for patients with acute mi acute heart<br>attack<br>and this is just showing how you record<br>this is eurocotton 2<br>how when you give it it doesn't work as<br>a vasodilator<br>so you tend to drop the blood pressure<br>when you give this to the animal<br>but surprisingly the nerve activity does<br>not increase so here was a drug that was<br>causing vasodilation<br>but not an increase in nerve activity so<br>this was<br>kind of exciting so we thought the<br>logical thing to do then was to inject<br>it into a human<br>and so we started to look around for<br>someone<br>and this man mark richards put his hand<br>up<br>as he was in charge of everything so we<br>this is wandy chan who was working as<br>the senior registrar at the time<br>and in fact we we injected into a group<br>of volunteers including dr cole was he<br>back is he gone<br>there is including dr cole uh we<br>injected into him<br>and so you can see again you get this<br>drop in blood pressure when you inject<br>this urochord into<br>and you get yeah an increase in heart<br>rate<br>just as what happened with the sheep but<br>unfortunately<br>um we didn't see a sustained fall in<br>cardiac<br>and sympathetic nerve activity remember<br>we weren't recording cardiac sympathetic<br>nerve activity in<br>humans we were recording it from the leg<br>well we could do that though dr cole we<br>could arrange for that<br>so this was a little bit disappointing<br>but but nevertheless an interesting<br>result<br>and just to show you unfortunately the<br>zoom thing is<br>blocking there but this is mark richards<br>and now mark richards as you all know<br>he's a man who who runs on sympathetic<br>nerve activity right<br>so um and these are his look at his look<br>at his nerves he's he's he's putting out<br>you know a pulse of<br>a burst of activity just about for every<br>heart rate no surprises there<br>right um chris charles<br>yeah pretty much the same<br>not bad yeah so here his this is his<br>uh so what about dr cole<br>so you know dr cole at least on the<br>surface you know<br>quite a little bit more more relaxed and<br>more um sort of<br>in control of things he looks he looks<br>relaxed<br>he's quite you know quite happy with<br>what's happening<br>he looks like he's on something i don't<br>know<br>um um<br>david cole so here's his nerve it's<br>actually probably just as just as<br>frequent and just as big as<br>the other i almost said competitors<br>they're not competitors they're subjects<br>in this<br>in this experiment so we dr cole was<br>quite pleased to get through all this<br>tact um we didn't tell them about all<br>the side effects<br>but these were reversible to a degree<br>and we found that yeah after a year or<br>and made a full recovery yeah so that<br>was good all in the name of science<br>good so and in general benson um<br>david cole and i've been working<br>together for years in general medicine<br>we've shared the same office<br>i don't know for how long and we've<br>always<br>believed that it's a lot of general<br>medicines about communication<br>the handover meeting in general medicine<br>is just an illustration of how this has<br>changed dramatically over the years<br>there's a lot of teams now involved<br>there's a lot of patients coming in<br>and my pet nightmare has always been<br>that a patient will fall between<br>fall between the teams but now the<br>registrars have got such a good system<br>that we don't see this we we do have<br>um a service manager who manages to<br>oversee all these things<br>and who has been fantastic for us dave<br>nicholl<br>and this this is the pie competition so<br>we do run an annual pie competition you<br>can see<br>here dr pithy accepting the trophy<br>on behalf of general medicine yes on<br>behalf of general medicine<br>from the gastro gustatory department who<br>really are you know they don't really<br>know about pies uh<br>and this is this this has been going on<br>now for i think<br>15 years or so there are other pie<br>champions here in the audience<br>um including including my neighbor phil<br>watts who<br>i don't think there were pies in the<br>elizabethan times but anyway he<br>he does that so as i say in gen med we<br>are we are a kali<br>a collegial department uh my challenge<br>with my teaching has always been to try<br>to um<br>yeah i guess translate all the work on<br>sympathetic nerves blood pressure<br>control<br>to the patient so when the students see<br>the patient at bedside they understand<br>what's happening<br>when that patient stands up is that you<br>know their heart rate's going up<br>their sympathetic nerves are all<br>contracting the blood pressure staying<br>the same<br>what's happening during heart failure<br>when sympathetic nerve activity is<br>inappropriately increased what's<br>happening in the hypertensive patient<br>why is that patient got low blood volume<br>so all these things that you can look at<br>at the bedside<br>you can apply a lot of the physiology<br>that i've discussed with you<br>today and it's actually a very<br>satisfying thing to do and i think the<br>students<br>the other thing that we're very strong<br>on is continuity of care these days what<br>what happens is that there are a massive<br>number of patients coming in<br>um and there are various models whereby<br>a patient comes into the emergency<br>department and they<br>and they go under a certain doctor and<br>then they change and they get<br>sort of handed over between several<br>different teams of doctors and then<br>three days later they get discharged<br>and the discharging doctors really know<br>nothing about what's been going on<br>we're very strong on trying to keep that<br>patient under the same team<br>so that we get to know the patient and<br>so that registrars understand<br>what our decisions are all about so<br>we're very strong on that as well<br>that's about all i've got to say i i've<br>probably gone over time<br>i want to thank as i say i want to thank<br>everyone<br>here who's helped me over the years<br>the including<br>research technicians who are too many<br>ready to name<br>but also teaching administrative staff<br>including diane taylor and fran barrett<br>who have been<br>or some people need more organizing than<br>others shall we say and i am one of<br>those people<br>um uh and finally<br>when you've done all the research and<br>you've got all your data<br>together um you've actually got to take<br>it to someone<br>um a statistician right because if you<br>don't<br>get the statistics done you're never<br>ever going to publish anything<br>and so i've been lucky enough to<br>work with mr data yeah you can see he's<br>got that cold analytical sort of look to<br>him<br>he's going to sometimes skeptical yeah<br>skeptical of your figures<br>um but i've been lucky enough to work<br>with chris<br>chris frampton um who's been very has<br>been a<br>major help to me so and without chris i<br>wouldn't have been able to<br>do studies grant<br>applications papers anything in fact my<br>life would have been a lot easier<br>without chris franklin<br>so thank you and especially i want to<br>thank ruth again<br>my wife who's down here as i said she<br>made big sacrifices to leave her family<br>and come out<br>and live in new zealand she's brought up<br>three fantastic children<br>she's always supported me in my teaching<br>and clinical work not so much<br>my research because research eats into<br>family time and i totally<br>my name is richard geary i'm here at<br>department medicine it's my job to wrap<br>things up with regards to<br>what david said today i first met david<br>in 1993 david you and my mentor on<br>cardiology probably<br>remember and you told me about neck<br>suction which was a device that we put<br>around the neck<br>to change the pressure in the product<br>science i believe<br>my 17 year old son came home recently<br>with a different example<br>so since time uh

long<br>period of time driving the<br>department of medicine for the the<br>hospital uh<br>playing a huge role there and then<br>there's also the teaching role that<br>you've got in the family the balance is<br>all there<br>is there's a huge generation of doctors<br>who are out there right now<br>who owe you a huge debt of gratitude for<br>the leadership that you've shown the<br>teaching that
