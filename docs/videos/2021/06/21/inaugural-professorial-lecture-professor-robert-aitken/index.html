The first is marketing to children and, in particular, the ways in which commercialisation and the promotion of materialistic values can negatively influence the nature and experience of childhood. The second is in relation to sustainability and (over) consumption and how (and whether) areas such as corporate social responsibility and business ethics can reconcile the tensions between business imperatives to make a profit and social concerns to protect resources; in particular, what are the barriers that make it difficult for people to consume sustainably and what can businesses do to help overcome them.<br><br><br>First delivered 1 June 2021.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my

to the<br>life of the university and the wider<br>community<br>he was head of the department of<br>marketing for more than seven years<br>and has forged strategic relationships<br>with new zealand marketing departments<br>through the new zealand head of<br>department network<br>he was elected to the national executive<br>of the australian new zealand marketing<br>academy<br>in 2017 and such has

this<br>evening it's really wonderful to<br>to see you all here i'm just going to<br>say a few words by way of an<br>introduction uh for professor aiken<br>so professor robert aiken joined the<br>department of<br>marketing as the acting vice chancellor<br>has said in 2000<br>coming from the university of exeter<br>where he taught media communication and<br>cultural studies<br>robert's interest in how the media and<br>marketing work<br>to privilege particular areas and how<br>culture influences their reception<br>and affects behavior continue to inform<br>his teaching and research here at<br>otago robert has a deep interest in<br>education and commitment to providing<br>the environments in which people learn<br>most effectively so it's no surprise<br>that he's<br>as the acting vice chancellor has said<br>one of only three lecturers<br>in the otago business school to have<br>received the university's highest<br>teaching excellence award and in rob's<br>case that was in 2009<br>he's featured several times as a top 10<br>finalist in the iusa<br>annual teaching awards and as it's been<br>said<br>one of only four new zealand recipients<br>of the australian and new zealand<br>marketing<br>academy's emerging marketing educator<br>award<br>now robert's interest in and commitment<br>education is reflected<br>in his roles as chair of the<br>undergraduate committee<br>in the business school and director of<br>the undergraduate teaching<br>and learning committee in his department<br>committed to staff and student<br>development rob<br>has recently initiated the otago<br>business school<br>early career staff development program<br>and he has supervised over 50 research<br>students in his career<br>now rob's current research focuses on<br>two major<br>two major areas the first is marketing<br>to children and in particular<br>the way in which commercialization and<br>the promotion<br>of materialistic values<br>influencing influencing the nature and<br>experience of childhood<br>the second area is in sustainability and<br>consumption<br>and how areas such as corporate social<br>responsibility<br>and business ethics can reconcile the<br>tensions between business imperatives to<br>make profit<br>and social concerns to protect resources<br>on these and many other topics robert<br>has published over 80<br>papers with many in top-ranked journals<br>he has delivered invited lectures on<br>these and other topics in latin america<br>north america india europe and elsewhere<br>now in 2006 robert helped to establish<br>and develop the otago forum which<br>addressed the shifting idea of service<br>dominant logic and this is considered to<br>be one of the most influential changes<br>in our understanding of marketing in the<br>last 25 years<br>as the acting vice chancellor has said<br>robert has been the recipient based on<br>this and other work of the<br>european association for consumer<br>researchers<br>best film

this<br>appointment in particular has given<br>robert the ability an opportunity to<br>contribute his research expertise<br>and social business commitment to<br>championing the rights of consumers<br>and he is currently also of course the<br>president of the australia and new<br>zealand marketing academy as has been<br>said already<br>and that's the leading regional academy<br>of

on<br>the topic of<br>well thank you very much um tenecotto<br>tenecotto tenococho katoa<br>slanjabar um thank you very much for<br>your lovely welcome and thank you for<br>coming<br>um to travel hopefully<br>i think is my take on robert louis<br>stevenson's<br>um poem of um better travel hopefully<br>than to arrive because i think it's most<br>most important thing is about how you<br>get there the way you get there not so<br>much about getting there<br>well unless it's on a plane to<br>wellington of course in which case i<br>think to get there safely is probably<br>the most important thing<br>but generally speaking i think it's<br>important to learn the experiences of<br>all the people that<br>you've come into contact with along the<br>way and i am so pleased and proud and<br>humbled by the people around me here<br>today<br>as well as all my friends and relatives<br>overseas but it's so nice to have people<br>here<br>each and every one of you who i've<br>worked with or i've got to know has kind<br>of helped me along the way so<br>for that i'm eternally grateful<br>um okay so i was going to start off<br>playing some music<br>because i think music can say a lot of<br>things but i was told there's no<br>you can't play music because it's um<br>copyright the copyright issue so<br>okay well in that case i'll sing i think<br>that's quite a different way of starting<br>but<br>my experience of singing is not too<br>positive um thank you to mrs saunders<br>who was my<br>intermediate school music teacher who<br>had a famous reputation<br>for her school productions<br>and her choirs i remember being in the<br>first class of hers<br>bellowing at the top of my voice<br>jerusalem you can't really sing<br>jerusalem slowly or quietly<br>and she would come around and say things<br>like well bit slower or a bit louder or<br>quieter um but she tapped me on the<br>shoulder and she said could you go and<br>read to the juniors<br>um so i won't be um i won't be singing<br>any songs but my reading is quite good<br>so for that i do have to to be grateful<br>i think it's important before you start<br>to be clear about your expectations<br>um my expectations um<br>hopefully um to travel hopefully um and<br>they are that<br>it's been quite an interesting<br>experience trying to think about how to<br>put together a story about my life and<br>um i've tried to piece some things<br>together mostly around the things that<br>have influenced me and continue to<br>influence me<br>and i'm also aware that according to you<br>know jean-luc goddard every<br>every good story has a beginning and<br>middle and end but not necessarily in<br>that order<br>so i'm going to make this quite an<br>interactive session really i think every<br>time someone says to me this is an<br>interactive session i go oh no i'd like<br>to leave<br>anyway this is going to be interactive<br>in the sense that i'm going to tell you<br>my story<br>and it's up to you to try and make sense<br>of it in your own sense<br>so this is not a passive sit back and<br>listen this is like oh okay maybe how<br>does that fit<br>um i think somebody else once famously<br>said that<br>you don't really know what you're going<br>to say well unless it's a speech or a<br>a pre-rehearsed statement you don't<br>really know what you're going to say<br>until you say it<br>so i'm actually as interested in as i<br>before i start<br>i did that once before and someone said<br>well when you could just get on with it<br>i said well<br>this is it um anyway um<br>i think it's important to when you're<br>trying to understand the character and<br>where you've come from and what you've<br>gained and what you've<br>learned and according to charles dickens<br>the way to understand the character is<br>by what people say<br>what they do and what other people say<br>about them so i'm going to start off<br>just by reading out a couple of things<br>from my students<br>from student evaluations just to kind of<br>set the scene<br>robert is a fantastic lecturer i love<br>robert's lectures<br>oh so that's all the stuff i've been<br>writing actually what they<br>what they really what they really<br>honestly said was<br>i like robert's lectures especially when<br>there's only a couple of these i'm not<br>going to go on too why does he have so<br>many slides<br>and not use half of them<br>i love his lectures but his rants annoy<br>me<br>and my favorite one because i think this<br>sums up my attitude to education in<br>general<br>he just asks too many questions and<br>doesn't provide a single answer<br>so there won't be any answers tonight um<br>but as i tried to tell my students<br>um these are not tangents it goes off on<br>too many tangents they're not tangents<br>tangents i don't know they just go away<br>these are digressions<br>these are digressions that hopefully<br>enable them to see what i'm trying to<br>say in a range of different ways<br>but i will try and stick to the point uh<br>this evening um<br>i'm going to start with my childhood<br>even you know<br>that is the beginning and particularly<br>to one of the two people on my dedicated<br>presentation tonight my dad<br>um who i know most people start off by<br>talking about the people who helped them<br>along the way<br>well i'm going to talk about my dad and<br>well firstly we need to recognize that i<br>have a mixed parentage<br>my father and his his family are from<br>scotland<br>and my mother and her family are from<br>england<br>and so it's been quite an interesting<br>upbringing to recognize the different<br>cultural influences on people's lives<br>and even though it's the same country it<br>is not the same culture<br>and so although i know mostly the<br>stories of bannetburn<br>and stirling bridge and preston pans<br>and i have almost no idea what my mum's<br>family did<br>during those kind of periods every<br>family gathering<br>would be embroidered<br>and and fused with songs from scotland<br>so<br>the flower of scotland and loch lomond<br>there will be battles between kenneth<br>mckellar and cliff richard<br>and so i've had to live a kind of rich<br>experience of different cultural<br>influences<br>but i have to say if it wasn't for my<br>dad<br>i would have been way less productive<br>i would have been much happier to sit on<br>the couch and read or go out and play<br>football<br>or spend my time watching movies and<br>watching tv but oh no<br>um that wasn't good enough for him his<br>kind of strong<br>protestant work ethic meant that i had<br>to get up early<br>i had to feed the birds i had to get the<br>coal in<br>like to clean the stuff around the<br>fireplace<br>i had to get a job as soon as i was old<br>enough i could ride my bike everywhere<br>so i do have to thank him in a way for<br>the way in which he and cr you know and<br>celtic and enculturated those values<br>into my<br>life and my experience and my<br>expectations um<br>so i have to thank him for my work ethic<br>for his values about doing the right<br>thing always doing the right thing<br>always trying to help people always<br>trying to be generous even though um<br>they weren't my mom and dad weren't<br>particularly well off<br>um the fact that he was very resourceful<br>was very<br>innovative he was very creative um he<br>was our<br>our kind of area where we lived in he<br>was a backyard vet so people bought all<br>their kind of<br>animals and birds and things for him to<br>to to fix and to help<br>and so um i will just talk a little<br>about that<br>environment in which i was born and grew<br>up in a town called swindon<br>in the beautiful county of wiltshire and<br>as you can see i guess from some of<br>those pictures there<br>that swindon wheelchair has a<br>remarkably kind of rich history um<br>it's got the stone age it's got the iron<br>age it's got the bronze age<br>um it's got the romans i don't mean i<br>don't mean they're all still there i<br>just mean it's<br>it was part of this kind of history um<br>and then it's called in<br>moving into the 21st century um the 20th<br>century 19th century the railways<br>um it's a kind of confluence of the m4<br>and the great western railways with<br>enormously famous<br>railway um carriage building works a bit<br>like hillside<br>um it was a market town so i could um<br>get the sights and the sounds and the<br>smells of the countryside even though<br>we're in a town<br>um it's got avery which is the unsung<br>major stone stone age kind of relic<br>it's got stonehenge of course i've<br>actually climbed over pretty much all of<br>those stones because when we were at<br>school in swindon<br>one of our annual trips was out to a<br>place called devises to look at the<br>museum and then onto stonehenge and in<br>those days we were allowed to climb all<br>over them so i've actually been on the<br>altar stone<br>and of course now you can't get anywhere<br>near it and thank goodness<br>but i have a kind of rich and intimate<br>knowledge of some of these areas i'm<br>pointing out there's also silvery hill<br>the biggest man-made um kind of monument<br>unknown monument nobody has any idea<br>what it's for<br>from the stone age presumably the<br>white horse several white horses which<br>go back into the stone age as well<br>and my own particular areas of interest<br>were marlboro forest<br>savannah forest depicted and a couple of<br>pictures there and<br>fishing so i was always out with my dad<br>in the countryside fishing fishing<br>hunting camping tramping birding so i<br>developed what i would consider to be a<br>rich<br>connection to nature and if you<br>are fishermen or fisher people or have<br>any connection to the countryside you'll<br>know that to fish<br>effectively you really need to<br>understand the life cycle of a trout<br>you need to know what they feed on where<br>they sit in the river why they sit there<br>what feeds on the things that the trout<br>feed on so whether you're looking for<br>stone flies or mayflies or caddis lava<br>you need to know that kind of life cycle<br>so without being taught it<br>in a kind of formal way i kind of<br>learned to understand the kind of web<br>the eco web of all the connections and<br>if you mess around with this bit<br>you're going to mess around with that<br>bit so even though i wasn't conscious of<br>those things in that<br>sense in that way it's<br>stuck with me so i when i talk about my<br>um work on sustainability a bit later<br>um hopefully that you you'll be able to<br>see the connection but what i learned<br>from all this was<br>these early days was my love of nature<br>the importance of connections and i<br>became a vegetarian and joined the hunt<br>saboteurs<br>so my connection to the nature continued<br>to be in a much more kind of positive<br>sense<br>um okay i'm now going to talk a bit<br>about some of the things that influenced<br>me i've just<br>again during this process trying to pick<br>out these key moments or key things<br>from all the books i've ever read how do<br>you choose one or two or three that kind<br>of stick in your mind or made it made a<br>difference<br>well there's a collection there and i<br>want to just draw attention to a couple<br>of things i'm not going to go through<br>every one of them<br>you'll be pleased to hear but the things<br>that have given me my<br>access to nature were the most simple<br>straightforward books that you could get<br>hold of<br>so i have to say the lady bird series of<br>books<br>particularly what to look for in winter<br>what to look for in spring what to look<br>for in summer and what to look for in<br>autumn<br>gave me this beautiful picture of what<br>could be out in the countryside<br>and the kind of detail of the observer's<br>book of birds and the observer book of<br>nests and the<br>observer book of eggs enabled me to<br>recognize and identify<br>and also to help protect them<br>so i was lucky to have gain that kind of<br>interest<br>another area of interest that is<br>depicted on here is that for some reason<br>having spent so much time in the<br>countryside having understood some of<br>the folklore and the ways in which<br>animals and birds and plants and trees<br>and butterflies work and mingle<br>i wanted to run away so one of my aims<br>of the trial was to run away and live in<br>and i came across this book brendan<br>chase<br>which i read about 10 times about this<br>story of these boys who left of<br>a family um for a whole range of<br>different circumstances they weren't<br>you know they weren't they weren't<br>wanting to do it but they chose to do it<br>um so i tried to follow that so i spent<br>a lot of time trying to make dens and<br>you know live off the land as<br>so to speak um my other interests also<br>from the birds and animals i was<br>interested in was a book called cares a<br>kestrel for a knave<br>both the book and the film had a massive<br>effect on me when i was a young lad<br>i wanted to be a falconer um i started<br>reading all the books about falconry and<br>what you do and how you do it<br>a number of times it's mentioned in<br>shakespeare for example it's a very<br>it's a medieval kind of sport i've kind<br>of a kind of grand sport in many ways<br>um some of the language that we use<br>today comes from falconry<br>things like fed up or<br>wrapped around my little finger or under<br>the thumb<br>uh or hoodwinked or baited breath<br>they're all<br>falconry terms so also i'm trying to<br>make a tenuous link here to my<br>increasing<br>um however rather than just reading<br>about it i thought well i'll actually<br>try to do it because i mean sometimes<br>you don't know if you know something<br>until you try and do it<br>um so i read the books on falconry i<br>made the jesses they're the kind of<br>leather strips that you put around the<br>bird's legs<br>that then attach to a swivel which you<br>can hold on your hand or<br>attach to a perch i made a hood<br>i made a leather glove what i was<br>missing of course was a falcon<br>fortunately um i was able to obtain a<br>jack door<br>now a jack door it's a bit like a magpie<br>in fact it's the australian version of a<br>jack jaw<br>and so i kitted this jack door out with<br>its<br>jesse's and its hood um<br>and wandered around like this look it<br>looked quite impressive really<br>um but what i really wanted to do was to<br>get to a point where i could see some<br>quarry<br>like a pigeon flying or a starling or<br>something and i could<br>unhood it and and it would just kind of<br>stay there really<br>just stay there for ages so even though<br>i learned the mechanics<br>i never got quite all the way through to<br>actually doing<br>um what i really wanted to do um which<br>brings me to another part<br>of this early childhood experience and<br>that is my engagement<br>with consumption consuming<br>products um and<br>i've just got a couple of examples here<br>of how i was entirely<br>there's a link there later um i'll<br>remind you<br>um so the first one was<br>buying some jeans my family were not<br>um keen on buying expensive jeans<br>they would buy them for the local co-op<br>where you've got a discount<br>um actually a very kind of<br>community-minded organization in those<br>days but anyway<br>um so let's just say that a pair of<br>jeans in tesco's were<br>five dollars and a pair of levi's with<br>25 there's no way i would get a pair of<br>levi's except for my brother<br>who has looked after me all my life<br>really so thank you dennis if you're<br>watching<br>um but in those days<br>it sounds like i'm 400 years old in<br>those days<br>you had to buy your jeans shrink to fit<br>you couldn't buy them to fit you to buy<br>them two sizes too big<br>i was already pretty small so even their<br>smaller size would have already been<br>several sizes too big but anyway<br>i was determined you know i was at the<br>same kind of time that i was kind of you<br>know<br>starting to or starting to stop wearing<br>short trousers and starting to be a bit<br>more interested in you know<br>the fact they were you know there were<br>other creatures apart from boys<br>so i wanted to look quite cool in a way<br>so anyway so my brother bought me a pair<br>of jeans<br>two sizes too big as um as it says on<br>the<br>on on the label if you want to buy some<br>jeans you've got 30 waste you buy 34.<br>okay well how do you shrink them well<br>how you shrink them there are there's<br>only one way are those tight in those<br>days<br>well when you went away on your own you<br>have to put them on and sit in a bath<br>and they shrink honestly this is what<br>happened<br>so okay so i kind of was waiting for a<br>time when my mum and dad would go out<br>um and then i filled the bathroom but<br>i didn't know whether you put hot water<br>or cold water or<br>warm water what what'd he do so i went<br>for kind of warm water<br>um put my jeans on got in the bath<br>uh what how long do you sit there for i<br>mean do you watch them shrink<br>how do you know when you've lost two<br>inches<br>anyway i was must have been in there<br>half an hour um<br>and we were in in our house we there was<br>a toilet in the bathroom the same room<br>and then i heard the door going my<br>family coming home<br>okay what do i do what do i do what do i<br>do my dad was you know very straight<br>laced<br>guy didn't really think about fashion or<br>doing anything which was any different<br>um<br>slightly kind of military view i suppose<br>of how things should be you buy things<br>to fit or you sew them to fit you work<br>it out yourself anyway<br>i hear that here the footsteps up the<br>stairs he comes into the bathroom<br>goes to the to the loom um and i can<br>still remember<br>today the look of him looking down here<br>and then<br>looking over at me in the bath with<br>these jeans on<br>but anyway they never ever fit they<br>didn't fit<br>so i was completely sucked in by the<br>advertising and the marketing<br>and by the kind of sense in which i<br>wanted to be cool like<br>you know like other people so that<br>didn't work<br>um so my second example of<br>my engagement with marketing is<br>on the razor comb i got to that point<br>around a similar time when<br>i didn't want my dad to cut my hair<br>anymore especially with those little<br>hand clippers a bit like shearing<br>clippers i wanted to wanted a haircut<br>but we wouldn't pay for me to have a<br>haircut i didn't have any money um<br>so i saw an advert for a razor comb and<br>all you do with a razor comb is you just<br>comb it that's what you do<br>it's really easy it's straightforward<br>doesn't take very long well there you go<br>that isn't actually me but that is what<br>and the last example um is<br>one of the worst things you could do to<br>me as a kid and one of the worst<br>punishments was to make me stay in if<br>you don't use your toll robert you're<br>staying<br>if you're not by seven o'clock you'll<br>stay in bed all day it's like oh okay<br>so get up early and i want to go out and<br>when it's raining when it's tipping down<br>the rain there's nothing you can do<br>then you get to watch tv so i do<br>remember this very clearly<br>this example um being sat on a really<br>rainy horrible cold day in my um<br>lounge me kneeling on the floor watching<br>the tv i think i was watching cowboy<br>which i used to love you know i think it<br>might be cheyenne or<br>um lone ranger or something but anyway<br>um<br>now my sister was sat on the couch<br>reading a book<br>so my mum comes in and looks you know<br>with her look<br>it's one of those looks um says robert<br>what are you doing<br>someone watching tv why why are you<br>watching why are you doing something<br>useful<br>why are you wasting your time watching<br>tv why don't you read a book like your<br>sister<br>it's like well because you know this is<br>a cowboy i like cowboys do something<br>useful and just sit there watching tv<br>wasting your time<br>read a book yeah yeah but she's read<br>that book like 10 times it's like you<br>know<br>fifth form at mallory towers she knows<br>every word in there it's not<br>active it's not learning anything it's i<br>don't know what it's doing<br>but my point in mentioning that was that<br>throughout my life there's been a sense<br>in which doing certain things<br>like for example watching tv um watching<br>any form of media is like oh it's not<br>really quite as good as<br>reading or doing something a little bit<br>more refined and sophisticated<br>so i have a bit of a history of trying<br>to fight against some of these things<br>anyway i'm going to conclude this little<br>part of my formative<br>development from by reading um<br>from a e houseman's uh shropshire lad<br>i'm reading this because it's something<br>i read at my dad's funeral<br>it was a kind of sense of the end of<br>childhood<br>the war had taken place and things had<br>changed<br>also it's the title of one of my fa all<br>time favorite plays by dennis potter<br>which is called blue remembered hills<br>and into my heart an heir that kills<br>from yon far country blows<br>what are those blue remembered hills<br>what spires<br>what farms are those that is the land of<br>lost content<br>i see it shining plain the happy<br>highways where i went<br>on a much more positive note um moving<br>into the second part of my<br>presentation um i think one of the<br>things<br>i learned and gained was to see<br>the beauty and hope and mystery and<br>wonder and<br>interest and curiosity and experience in<br>everything you do<br>every tiny little thing you don't need<br>to do massive great big things<br>doing massive great big things is good<br>but you can understand<br>what those things might be from the<br>smallest of experiences<br>um and so this part of my life<br>is a bit more i'm going to call it kind<br>of summative in a way<br>where some of the ideas that started to<br>form much more strongly in my mind<br>became more and more important and again<br>from that whole mass of things i've read<br>that we've all read<br>many chosen these four because i think<br>they represent for me an enduring<br>sense of the indomitable spirit of man<br>the capacity for<br>great things but also the ability to be<br>destructive um and i was very very<br>taken when i read john steinbeck's the<br>grapes of wrath<br>and for those of you don't know it just<br>simply it's an epic story of a<br>family's struggle from the dust bowl<br>of oklahoma to the promised land of<br>california<br>where grapes grow and peaches grow and<br>it's a it's a land of milk and honey<br>but not really not really 150 000<br>migrants from<br>the dust bowl to california<br>um and their journey their pilgrimage<br>along the way where they meet people who<br>help them people who get in their way<br>people who steal from them<br>people who injure them it's a great i<br>think a great tribute to man's<br>by man i mean all of us capability<br>and resilience um to keep going and it<br>ends with what i would consider to be<br>the most powerful ending to a story i've<br>ever read<br>both tragedy and hope and i hope that<br>might be enough to interest you to read<br>it<br>so i won't tell you what happens um that<br>intense kind of experience is also<br>represented in the works of joseph<br>conrad<br>who i you know studied at quite some<br>length<br>and particularly heart of darkness which<br>will be familiar to you those people who<br>watched apocalypse now on which it was<br>based<br>but heart of darkness was also based on<br>a short story called outposted progress<br>where comrade experienced the horror<br>of what could happen when you were taken<br>away from society's kind of mores and<br>laws and just left with absolute power<br>to do whatever you liked to whoever you<br>liked<br>so that was you know quite stunning<br>really um<br>my interest in this capability<br>obviously represented in lord of the<br>flies which is<br>on the one hand a boy's own story about<br>kids who get<br>and we understand that they were not<br>going to be rescued so they're going to<br>be there they have to kind of make a<br>camp they have to work out how to all<br>organize themselves how to order<br>themselves who's in control who makes<br>decisions how they're going to get food<br>what they're going to do with it who<br>gets the opportunity to make those<br>decisions and we end up with two<br>opposing sides one led by a guy called<br>ralph<br>who i guess represents the sense of<br>consensus and democracy and cooperation<br>and collaboration and working together<br>and jack who represents well you know<br>we're bigger than you we're stronger<br>than you so we will decide what happens<br>here<br>um so yes it's a story of boys working<br>out what to do on an island but it's<br>also a sense<br>of how we maybe deal with<br>people who don't agree with us um in<br>general um and of course<br>bury my heart at wounded knee which is a<br>heartbreaking story<br>to provide a different perspective on<br>things i thought i knew about but<br>actually when i read those kinds of<br>books<br>realized that i knew nothing really and<br>still trying to find out<br>so a number of influences there and now<br>my academic influences or that had the<br>way they translated into academic<br>influences became increasingly<br>interested in culture<br>and how culture works what influence it<br>has it's one of those words that sounds<br>straightforward<br>and easy and we all kind of understand<br>it and of course we do in a way we're<br>all part of it we all contribute to it<br>but according to raymond williams it's<br>the most complicated and complex word in<br>the english dictionary<br>has so many different ways of<br>understanding it i became<br>really interested in meaning making how<br>do you make meaning how do you make<br>sense of things how do you take an idea<br>or an event and construct it in such a<br>way that<br>people can understand it or can people<br>can be persuaded by it<br>um i was interested in how the mass<br>media<br>works to represent ideas um<br>some ideas more than others how to<br>privilege privileges certain ideas<br>and in what way interested in the the<br>way we perceive things john burger's<br>ways of seeing<br>um given the the cultural associations<br>that we have with most things<br>um and probably most importantly the<br>notion of hegemony<br>um gramsci's view that actually to kind<br>of make sure that people<br>kind of work together whether they want<br>to or not you have to create<br>or you have to use things like the mass<br>media to create some kind of sense of<br>consensus<br>you have to make assumptions taken for<br>granted<br>natural so that whoever has access to<br>power<br>is able to represent power in such a way<br>who are at the other end of the power<br>system um think well that's the way it<br>should be<br>that seems fine what's wrong with that<br>that's that's the way it should be<br>um and i'm just trying to find a couple<br>of discourses that might<br>represent that and i'm only going to<br>choose two one of them is happiness<br>satisfaction and sex appeal are imminent<br>that means can happen any minute and<br>available the next purchase<br>so that's all you need um and<br>um and the good life how do you get the<br>good life the good life is consists of<br>buying stuff<br>so um these are i would argue<br>contemporary assumptions taken for<br>granted<br>prevalent<br>okay and that has was developed into my<br>interest<br>in the work excuse me of the birmingham<br>center<br>for contemporary cultural studies um<br>established by richard hoggart<br>um in the early 60s um joined by<br>raymond williams a bit later and some of<br>the more critical<br>and and in particular the idea of mass<br>culture so i've always enjoyed<br>interested in mass media but about mass<br>culture<br>um and looking at the ordinary everyday<br>lives of people<br>rather than the fr levis classical canon<br>of these are the things that are good<br>for you<br>like ballet and opera and classical<br>music<br>and classical books which are all fine<br>and good but they<br>kind of represented the classical canon<br>of what<br>is great about civilization and what<br>wasn't represented<br>was the ordinary everyday and often<br>extraordinary experiences of ordinary<br>people<br>and that became fascinating to me<br>because i came from ordinary people<br>it's just a working-class family that<br>you know<br>tried to do the best that it possibly<br>could with a limited means<br>and so when i started reading this stuff<br>and i started reading how<br>there's a shift to recognizing the<br>importance of understanding everyday<br>um activities like you know like like<br>being in a motorcycle<br>group or um you know being whatever<br>musical genre you like there are kind of<br>rituals and ways in which you kind of<br>recognize each other and the ways in<br>which you kind of<br>celebrate each other so whether it's<br>music or clothes<br>whether it's about the resistance to<br>some of the more<br>more expected cultural behaviors whether<br>it's resistance<br>through unionism for example<br>and the ways in which the media kind of<br>represent these things all became<br>a kind of mix of how i was trying to<br>interpret<br>some of my childhood some of my more<br>formative and summative reading<br>to understand how i can try and work a<br>way through<br>doing something about some of these<br>things during this period as well i came<br>across the work of<br>basil bernstein you'll be familiar with<br>his work as a sociologist on um<br>looking at looking at the performance of<br>kids in schools why do some kids perform<br>well in schools and others not<br>um and of course the prevailing idea was<br>well it's kind of genetic you know you<br>like the other inheritance it's like<br>natural nurture there's a big debate<br>going on at the time um and he was<br>interested he was asked by the<br>department of education to look into why<br>are these kids here<br>in these schools not doing so well is it<br>because they're not very bright<br>is it because we need to provide more<br>resources um is it because the<br>teaching's not very good<br>what is it and the idea was that well<br>actually you know<br>kids from the working class areas so i'm<br>just<br>using that's a stereotypical term but<br>kids from the kind of<br>working class families tended<br>not to do so well in schools<br>their achievement wasn't as good up to a<br>certain level<br>um their behavior quite often wasn't<br>that good and if you get behave if you<br>get people misbehaving<br>because they're not achieving then it's<br>a vicious cycle whereas<br>it seems that people from more middle<br>class backgrounds<br>um seem to do better just generalizing<br>these are just generalizations<br>so he did an enormously extensive study<br>of the<br>performance of kids across the uk<br>um and one of the things he decided to<br>look at<br>was well what's the language environment<br>what's the communication environment<br>of these different cultures should we<br>call them<br>and you know i'm sure we might<br>already kind of understand that language<br>is the key transmitter of values<br>cultural values<br>political values social values communal<br>values whatever<br>so looking at language might be a kind<br>of a starting point at least<br>and so what he came up with as you will<br>be familiar with is the<br>notion of restricted code and elaborated<br>code of language it's been<br>it's been refined in a number of ways<br>since um<br>and added to but it was quite i think it<br>was quite kind of groundbreaking in its<br>time<br>and also fitted quite well with my<br>interest in<br>recognizing and celebrating different<br>types of culture but anyway<br>restricted code is characterized by a<br>number of<br>things like um it's usually usually a<br>lot of<br>instructions a lot of um demands<br>a lot of yes no closed questions<br>um there is no recognition of the<br>of the the codes that are being used<br>it's just this is what we do and this is<br>how we do it<br>um whereas the elaborated code is much<br>more open it's much more about questions<br>it's much more about exploration it's<br>much more about not really being sure<br>but we will try it out<br>we'll try and work these things out it's<br>full of adjectives and edit<br>and adverbs this one over here was<br>mostly nouns or verbs<br>i know it doesn't sound very important<br>but actually when you think about what<br>is the experience of those languages it<br>starts become more interesting<br>but anyway these are the two codes you<br>came up with and then he analyzed of<br>course<br>the language culture of schools<br>and well you know the language culture<br>of a school<br>is much more like the elaborated code<br>than it is the restricted code<br>and so kids quite often found it quite<br>difficult<br>to come from this fairly limited<br>use of language into an environment<br>where they were expected to be expansive<br>and explorative and<br>innovative and creative in their<br>languages these kind of kids<br>found that much easier in that early<br>stage<br>so what happened was that this was one<br>of the pieces of research that led to<br>much more formalization of early<br>childhood of early<br>education to provide much more of a kind<br>of level playing field before you<br>started to get<br>into into learning more complex things<br>now it's not to say that the elaborated<br>code is richer or better<br>than they are than their restricted code<br>because i come from what i would say was<br>a restricted code background but we had<br>songs and poems and<br>people telling stories all the time<br>but in general there was this kind of<br>ways in which<br>um language was used quite differently<br>so um the last thing i want to talk<br>about in this<br>area is because of my interest in<br>popular culture and<br>this is also almost entirely for hamish<br>spencer's<br>one of the things that richard hoggart<br>and his contemporaries at the birmingham<br>center for contemporary cultural studies<br>did was to look at the ordinary everyday<br>experiences of people<br>so they looked at things like wrestling<br>they looked at things like darts they<br>looked at like things like<br>bingo they looked at greyhound racing<br>they looked at<br>all of those kind of everyday activities<br>well<br>what resonated with me was pigeon racing<br>and i remember talking to hamish<br>um quite some time ago about pigeon<br>racing and he said one of the things<br>that people had said to him because he<br>is a biologist and you know a zoologist<br>in fact was that they couldn't<br>understand how pigeons knew where to go<br>when they were racing how do they know<br>where to go how do they like to get<br>there<br>well of course they don't go in there<br>are they<br>they get taken there they're just flying<br>back<br>they come back home they're called<br>homing pigeons that should have been a<br>bit of a<br>bit of a giveaway really um but anyway<br>um<br>so my dad raised pigeons that was one of<br>his kind of passions in<br>in addition to being a backyard vet and<br>a woodturner<br>and an inventor and somebody made me get<br>up early in the mornings he also had<br>pigeons and it was my job to feed the<br>pigeons and on a saturday on the race on<br>friday sorry on the day before the race<br>day unless it was an overseas<br>day which case it would be wednesday but<br>let's just say it's friday it's my job<br>to go with my dad down to the pigeon<br>club at the working men's club<br>in swindon at that time there was<br>something like 87<br>000 registered pigeon fancying clubs in<br>the uk<br>now there are thirteen thousand anyway<br>um<br>and it's my job to help basket and ring<br>the pigeon so you get a pigeon<br>you have to kind of put a rubber ring on<br>its leg and the rubber ring has a number<br>on it and your number's against your<br>name<br>and then it goes into a basket and then<br>the baskets come into a big container<br>and the container drives away and then<br>at<br>12 o'clock on the dot on saturday<br>morning they all get let off<br>they all fly back as quickly as possible<br>pigeons come into the loft as that one<br>on the top right corner does<br>um i take the ring off the pigeon's leg<br>i put it in the brass thing which is<br>just under the pigeon picture of the<br>pigeon and i put it in the clock<br>and press the button and it clocks the<br>time<br>so it's you know quite a simple process<br>absolutely fascinating i think now<br>um because in the same way that to<br>understand fishing you have to<br>understand what it feeds on where it<br>lives and what it does but to understand<br>pigeons you have to understand<br>um what time of the year they it's best<br>to send best to send them when they're<br>breeding how do you get the colors are<br>some colors better than others for<br>example<br>that my dad would never have a white<br>pigeon in the loft because you know they<br>never flew as good as blue ones<br>there's a whole culture around the<br>colors my dad taught me how you worked<br>out the genetics<br>of pigeons so if you had a red checker<br>with a blue checker you might end up<br>with a<br>mosaic or a you know a blue hen or<br>something in the same way that you know<br>when you're looking at breeding animals<br>you can<br>work out what colors you want um and<br>why i just mentioned in addition to the<br>fact that it was a something i<br>grew up with and then recognized it<br>through the<br>work of um richard hogg well actually<br>this<br>this is a this is a serious it could be<br>a serious academic study<br>of why people do it and what are the<br>rituals and ceremonies and<br>anyway last just last year that pigeon<br>there was sold<br>for that amount of money so<br>it's not just a trivial thing is it if<br>it's worth that amount of money<br>okay and the last one is the<br>one that i guess out of all of them had<br>the biggest effect on me<br>rachel carson's um silent spring<br>initially the name was because of her<br>fear that where she was living there<br>wouldn't be any more birds singing in<br>the morning<br>because they're all dying from<br>pesticides and poison<br>so she was the i think she was the one<br>who made<br>in the environment put the environment<br>on the map<br>she was the one who started the<br>environmental movements she was the one<br>who provided the scientific evidence of<br>what was happening<br>and was the one who bore the brunt of<br>the big petro<br>chemical companies who were producing<br>the poisons and pesticides especially<br>ddt that she<br>wanted to get rid of so um i am greatly<br>indebted to<br>even though it's an apocryphal you know<br>dysfunctional vision um<br>it did lead to i think strengthening my<br>resolve to try and do something<br>so this is the this is the reflective<br>part<br>um and i think as a teacher that is my<br>job<br>i'm not saying i've got a gift i've<br>found what i'm interested in<br>and now i'm trying to get other people<br>interested in it and i'm trying to say<br>why<br>so why marketing i mean i've already<br>given you some examples of why marketing<br>didn't actually work very well for me<br>why on earth<br>would i move into marketing well you<br>know so i've got a background in<br>understanding work in the media in<br>meaning making in<br>consumer behavior and understanding<br>culture um<br>marketing needs and works with all of<br>those things so i thought<br>even though it wasn't a normal um<br>trajectory had enough things i could<br>make a contribution<br>um but when i started reading some of<br>the textbooks in marketing<br>i noticed that pretty much all the<br>language was about warfare<br>um there's like targets or the front<br>line or make a killing<br>um or you know um price war<br>so whoa forward this subject has some<br>way to go really where are all the<br>metaphors about<br>family or gardening or<br>like an ecosystem none of them<br>i have to say there's more than that<br>happening now<br>and also the shift in marketing of the<br>last few years<br>partly in relation to the service<br>dominant logic that<br>robbie mentioned was an emphasis on<br>relationships you know businesses want a<br>relationship with us they want to create<br>some kind of loyalty<br>you know about loyalty schemes um but i<br>always think well if you<br>if you kind of want some kind of loyalty<br>from your customers you have to<br>give something so i you say to my<br>students<br>actually i think the relationship should<br>be based on the same kinds of ways in<br>which you would judge a personal<br>relationship<br>so then the way you would understand<br>what personal relationship is worth it<br>is like<br>so either is the person you're related<br>with are they honest are they truthful<br>they're transparent are they open<br>and if so then maybe that's gonna work<br>so does business do that<br>how far does business go if it wants a<br>relationship<br>how far does it go in providing the<br>environment within which<br>those i might wanna have a relationship<br>with a company um<br>so um so i'm i thought marketing would<br>be<br>a good place to start um<br>and i guess the most important bit was<br>that<br>if marketing and in many ways<br>possibly reasonably if marketing is<br>responsible<br>for getting us to this place<br>couldn't it also have the capacity to<br>get us out of it<br>if it can if it can persuade and<br>convince<br>and encourage people to do these kinds<br>of things surely<br>it can be used to get us out<br>of that situation which is why um<br>i thought marketing would be quite a<br>challenge um and it would also enable me<br>to teach you would<br>enable me to teach marketing from an<br>eco-friendly systemic kind of point of<br>view<br>it would enable me to talk about<br>frugality and voluntary simplicity<br>and the ways in which people conserve<br>and are resilient and can recycle and<br>that would be a perfect opportunity<br>a perfect opportunity to deal with this<br>situation we're in i'm not going to<br>spend too much time going through the<br>details of this just enough to frame how<br>i've kind of<br>dealt with my concerns with what's<br>many many of you will have seen these<br>kinds of representations of the earth<br>systems either the social systems or the<br>earth systems<br>on every possible count we are losing<br>or increasing our likelihood of losing<br>the resources we need on every single<br>measure<br>um what we need is to recognize that the<br>present global system<br>um isn't working so we really need a<br>massive transformation<br>of the way things are structured but i<br>can't do that so i have to work out<br>okay so what what can i do to kind of<br>help um<br>one of the things i'm interested in<br>trying to um<br>deal with are some of the contrasts on<br>this slide<br>so moving and increasingly trying to<br>work with students to understand<br>what the implications of being a<br>shareholder<br>are in comparison to being a stakeholder<br>and what does that mean<br>and what role can they play in that much<br>more interested in<br>moving beyond measures of gdp as they're<br>normally done and we're getting some way<br>towards that with putting well-being<br>into some of our measures<br>um moving from a linear<br>method of production and consumption to<br>a much more circular one<br>and i guess one of the most important<br>ones having a long term rather than a<br>short-term view of things so alongside<br>that have been the development of the<br>united nations<br>sustainability goals and although people<br>complain there are too many of them<br>um there are fewer than there used to be<br>so i think that's a step forward<br>um and they're still on the agenda so we<br>still can pick off some of it<br>i think that for us in uh<br>in the areas of sustainability the fact<br>that we've got a dedicated<br>um sustainable development goal number<br>12 responsible production consumption<br>gives us the license<br>gives us the encouragement to start<br>developing plans to how we might<br>approach that in terms of our research<br>so that has been a great boost and also<br>in the school of business as you'll know<br>we have the sdgs as a strategic<br>imperative<br>we are signed up to a number of<br>organizations that are also trying to do<br>that so there is a<br>of course there is a ground swell um in<br>trying to change things<br>we take some issue with the united<br>nations who are we<br>but we take some issue um<br>the people i work with with the united<br>nations view of sustainability being<br>uh dependent on three equal pillars<br>um the social pillar the environmental<br>pillar and the economic pillar we think<br>that's not going to work<br>what you have to have is we have to have<br>the environment as the number one<br>underpinning for all of this and the<br>economy is just a tool<br>to enable sustainability of a society to<br>develop<br>so we think there needs to be a rethink<br>of that<br>um just a quick look at where new<br>zealand's doing this is the early days<br>um so we think we're really good at all<br>of these kind of things but if you look<br>at<br>number 15 well if you look at life on<br>land and life underwater we are not<br>doing too well<br>how does that fit with you know the pure<br>clean green<br>reputation that we have<br>so we have a long way to go<br>but um we are making a step<br>these are just some defining statements<br>that we have used to<br>frame the research network for<br>sustainable business that<br>robin mentioned these are the kinds of<br>things that we think<br>actually make it impossible for us to<br>continue<br>doing what we're doing and so we set up<br>this network<br>to try to pull all the resources<br>of people around us to work alongside<br>the center for<br>sustainability which is doing a<br>fantastic job of looking at the major<br>areas of<br>energy and power and transport<br>but we thought well we need to focus on<br>some things that we could do something<br>about<br>and what we decided to focus on was the<br>consumer<br>the role of the consumer we should have<br>some expertise and experience<br>and ways in which we might be able to<br>make some kind of influence<br>so we divided um our<br>ideas into answering these kinds of<br>questions<br>um with a view to hopefully<br>increasing the ability and the<br>opportunity for consumers to<br>consume more sustainably we know for<br>example that<br>30 percent of consumers when they're<br>interviewed say that they would like to<br>consume<br>sustainably but actually only about<br>three percent do so<br>why is that apart from social<br>desirability by us that we know<br>is a has an effect why is that such a<br>massive gap why is there such a massive<br>attitude behavior gap so these were some<br>of the things that we wanted to<br>look at um how do you motivate people<br>who are not already<br>behaving cons sustainably to be more<br>sustainable<br>um so we found some the model of course<br>which<br>suggests that there are some ways here<br>that we could work on what you know<br>what's the information that people need<br>what are the barriers that people<br>are up against um what are the<br>cultural influences so we<br>took the opportunity to work<br>to provide some questions in the new<br>zealand lifestyles<br>study that rob lawson started back in<br>the late<br>1970s not quite up there with the<br>dunedin study<br>in many ways but comparative in the<br>sense of<br>what people think and feel across new<br>zealand so every five years<br>we do this um study of representative<br>study<br>of the people of new zealand and try and<br>categorize them into<br>looking at their behaviors their<br>attitudes their opinions their<br>consumption habits<br>to see if we can segment the new zealand<br>population<br>and and the more that we can try to find<br>some commonalities<br>amongst some of these segments the more<br>efficient and effective we might be able<br>to be<br>in promoting these kinds of behaviors so<br>it's a very simple idea in many ways<br>and it's been extremely valuable for the<br>department i think and for individuals<br>within the department to have<br>this kind of resource and this kind of<br>data available<br>the latest one that is run by leah<br>watkins will be being published in the<br>next couple of weeks<br>um and there's uh i think there's an<br>interesting segment that's emerged in<br>this one<br>and you know i i know what goes on tour<br>stays on tour so it's not public yet but<br>it's the what we're calling the new new<br>the new new zealanders<br>and for the first time seeing a segment<br>that is<br>anti-discrimination anti-materialistic<br>much more accommodative of more liberal<br>views<br>and sense of how people and communities<br>can work um<br>of a certain age group and a certain<br>kind of educational background so it's<br>like whoa<br>okay so this kind of assimilation this<br>mixing<br>maybe is starting to happen<br>anyway before we could carry on we<br>needed to find out who we were working<br>with so one of the groups that we came<br>up with was what we called the<br>they were called in the literature<br>conscious consumers we've called them<br>conscientious consumers because<br>conscious is kind of being aware of<br>something conscientious<br>is probably doing something about it so<br>we were thinking well what is it that<br>motivates people to do this stuff<br>is it their moral foundations um<br>is it is that there is the values which<br>underpins<br>why they do what they do so we<br>did some research on trying to work out<br>okay what are the relationships between<br>people's moral foundations their<br>political beliefs and their likelihood<br>or not<br>to engage in sustainable behavior<br>and just simply without going through<br>all the details i mean<br>the more liberal left you may not be<br>surprised to hear<br>are more likely to consume sustainably<br>the more right leaning right<br>are less likely to unless it seems<br>it's more moving towards being<br>compulsory or<br>that there are some kind of external<br>incentives to do it or that there is<br>some recognition<br>of that behavior now why this is<br>important again is because well<br>as marketers that should give us some<br>ways in which we might<br>work out how we might promote those<br>kinds of behaviors to those kind of<br>people<br>rather than do the scatter shot<br>generalized appeals most of which<br>don't work one of the other barriers<br>that we identify was<br>and you again this is one of those<br>things that you if i asked you<br>to come up with a list of five things<br>that stop people from consuming<br>um sustainably you probably come up with<br>the same list so in some ways this is<br>confirmatory but for us it was quite<br>incisive because it enabled us to focus<br>on one of the things<br>that we thought we could do something<br>about which is encouraging businesses to<br>provide more information<br>in a free market for a free market to be<br>free you have to have equal access to a<br>whole range of<br>resources and information is one of<br>those resources<br>and so when companies are saying that<br>they're being sustainable they're<br>providing this well<br>really are they providing the amount of<br>innovation the type of information what<br>kind of information do<br>consumers actually need so a we<br>identified that they want information<br>they've got enough knowledge about the<br>issues they know the issues<br>by and large but what they don't know is<br>how they can do something about it<br>through their product<br>consumer choices and increasingly we're<br>finding that consumers are using their<br>consumption as a kind of proxy for what<br>they believe in<br>more and more consumers are buying<br>things from companies who they think<br>are doing the right thing that is one of<br>the trends that<br>i think we could we've recognized over<br>the last few years so<br>um we can't really get companies really<br>to<br>do much about price or convenience or<br>availability but we surely<br>should be able to encourage them to<br>provide the kinds of information<br>um that their consumers want<br>um a couple other projects that<br>um been developing alongside<br>the conscious consumers one is firstly<br>the<br>literacy project we were astounded<br>by unicef's figures when they were doing<br>the global<br>survey into building our future um<br>children and the sdgs to find that new<br>zealand kids were<br>pretty low almost the lowest<br>in their knowledge of sustainable of<br>their relationship between<br>sustainability<br>consumption and the environment and so<br>they<br>we developed developing a project which<br>is going to try and increase the degree<br>of literacy<br>of kids in schools<br>as a way of starting this process and if<br>it's a circular process you have to<br>start somewhere<br>and just recently relatively recently um<br>completed the<br>back casting project the envisioning<br>project quite simply<br>you know if you can't imagine what the<br>world is going to look like how do you<br>how you how do you<br>possibly get there um so on the one hand<br>we know that young kids are not<br>very familiar with sustainability and<br>its implications what about tertiary<br>education<br>what about kids and students at this age<br>what do they know<br>well we were really surprised to find<br>that they were actually not just very<br>knowledgeable<br>but actually very concerned about making<br>some kind of a difference<br>they felt that education was central<br>they felt that the government was<br>central<br>they felt that technology would make a<br>difference not provide all the answers<br>which i think is a common<br>misunderstanding um and they felt that<br>the community<br>would provide some kind of leadership in<br>working towards a more sustainable<br>future<br>and so we asked them about you know okay<br>imagine 50 years you have to do 50 years<br>rather than 10 years because if you do<br>10 years or<br>15 years it's kind of too close to<br>what's happening now if you do 50 years<br>you have to make a bit of a jump<br>so okay 50 years time what would life be<br>like in terms of<br>housing and food and clothing and travel<br>and from that from those ideas<br>the idea is that we would then work<br>backwards to work out what needs to be<br>done<br>like what kind of policy changes what<br>kind of government intervention what<br>kind of government incentives<br>need to be done um we are just now<br>working on this<br>project um there was a call from the<br>planetary health um<br>aim of the the lancet for looking at the<br>the implications<br>of of um having a non-sustainable<br>economy and but one of the one of the<br>items within it was well what about<br>where does consumption fit what is<br>materialism fit<br>what is the relationship between<br>materialism which is the desire for more<br>and more<br>products or possessions and<br>the mental health for example the<br>self-esteem for example of people who<br>can't afford them<br>if you have a constant bombardment of<br>advertising things to people who can't<br>afford them and let's just say some of<br>those people might be more vulnerable<br>they might be older they might be<br>younger what<br>effect does that have so it's not just<br>the physical stuff<br>that has been looked at we're looking at<br>okay so what are the psychological<br>sociological<br>cultural impacts of that kind of<br>constant expectation of having to<br>consume more and more which brings me to<br>my pet subject<br>so one of the things one of the research<br>projects that we were particularly<br>pleased about because this was a<br>a great example i think of the fusion<br>between what's important to teach<br>and what's important to research so some<br>of you will remember<br>back in 2013 fonterra launched a free<br>milk in schools<br>project a pilot project up in northland<br>to begin with<br>mostly in low decile schools and then as<br>the project<br>seemed to be quite successful they then<br>expanded out for the rest of the country<br>so now well not now because they've just<br>stopped it but up until relative<br>recently<br>you could get free milk in schools okay<br>so that sounded like a really good idea<br>um<br>but of course as researchers we have to<br>go yeah well that's that sounds good<br>and the mass media representation of it<br>the support for it the encouragement was<br>absolutely overwhelmingly positive<br>um the biggest philanthropic<br>contribution to new zealand society<br>ever 10 million dollars a year that<br>fonterra was giving to schools<br>of course overwhelming support for such<br>a project<br>but when you start to think about it<br>and when you think about the context it<br>provides a number of interesting issues<br>for students to consider<br>one of those quotes about too many<br>questions i suppose but one of the<br>questions is so<br>why are they doing this what might be<br>some of the reasons i mean some of them<br>were<br>quite explicit when fonterra did make it<br>clear they wanted to make a contribution<br>um to the community um however if you<br>just think about fonterra's history the<br>recent<br>relatively recent history they they were<br>involved in a number of unpleasant<br>examples of<br>adulterated milk in china that led to<br>the death of some children they had to<br>do a massive global recall of their<br>products<br>because of suspected tampering with<br>some of the production lines um<br>there was quite clearly a decline in<br>milk sales<br>um and i guess if you add those up there<br>was a sense in which there's<br>some kind of public relations<br>and at the same time there was quite<br>clearly<br>a move towards the intensification of<br>dairy<br>in new zealand so<br>not saying any of this is good or bad<br>just saying well actually there's some<br>questions here that we really should ask<br>and then you think okay so that what<br>they're doing is providing free milk in<br>schools<br>um so as an actor philanthropy one of<br>the characteristics quite often<br>of philanthropy is it's anonymous well<br>this was fonterra's<br>anchor milk in schools<br>it was quite clearly labelled as were<br>the fridges it was kept in<br>as were the waste paper baskets they<br>were chucked away in so<br>it's a branding exercise in many ways<br>if it's a branding exercise if it's<br>marketing in schools is that a good<br>thing<br>we already have some concerns about the<br>commercialization of childhood<br>the constant barrage and bombardment of<br>advertising products<br>throughout the whole about life but<br>certainly at childhood<br>level is that our kids at that age this<br>is primary school age are they able to<br>recognize the difference between a brand<br>and marketing exercise um and<br>just a genuine offer of help<br>at what age they become more critical<br>certainly from all the research that we<br>looked at<br>not until later than this if it's<br>provided in schools is that a way of<br>legitimizing it or endorsing it because<br>we look to teachers and schools to<br>so there were a number of issues that we<br>considered to be worth<br>exploring and i think overall what we<br>kind of felt was that well firstly<br>the milk was going mostly to those<br>decile schools low decile schools are<br>mostly the ones with children whose<br>healthy eating habits may not be as well<br>developed as others their<br>obesity levels are much higher so is<br>milk the right<br>product for people in those situations<br>which isn't done the question<br>according to the american medical<br>association it isn't<br>whose role is it to provide a healthy<br>start to the day<br>is it the government's role is it a<br>parent's role is it a commercial<br>company's role<br>and what is the relationship between<br>commercialization and education anyway<br>so we were able to use what we got from<br>this research to inform some teaching<br>and to ask the kinds of questions<br>that any critical engagement with any<br>phenomena<br>any experience we were suggesting should<br>be asked<br>that teaching of that with the quote<br>which says no ethical<br>moral social or spiritual justification<br>that's pretty powerful<br>anyway um<br>so how does all that affect or influence<br>or have anything to do with my other<br>role<br>in a number of organizations well as<br>both helen and robin pointed out i'm a<br>proud member of consumer<br>organization um and have been able to<br>influence not massively what it does<br>because i'm<br>just the chair of the board i just<br>mostly do go through the minutes<br>um but every time we have a strategic<br>development day um i am able to make<br>some impact<br>um in how they might shift the emphasis<br>so you will have noticed<br>i'm going to take all the credit for<br>this of course um there's been quite a<br>shift in their<br>campaigning over the last few years um<br>much more about pushing um things like<br>free range you know what<br>what do we mean by free range what you<br>know what does it mean what are the<br>implications<br>um everybody will be aware of the<br>sunscreen debacle<br>this is advertising and marketing saying<br>that these products do these things<br>a bit like the razer comb really well<br>maybe it's just the way i used it but i<br>mean maybe it could be used properly but<br>this is a sunscreen this is the people<br>are relying on this to give them the<br>kind of protection<br>that they need particularly for children<br>how is it that in the 21st century we<br>have a we have some major companies<br>still<br>promoting products that don't do what<br>they say they will do<br>and we've had the examples recently of<br>neurofen you know being<br>550 000 for saying actually if you've<br>got back pain<br>you should take this one if you're<br>feeling a bit low should take this one<br>you've got a headache you should take<br>this one if you've got a period pain you<br>take this one actually they're all the<br>same<br>but they're all priced differently how<br>can that be<br>so you do need a watchdog light consumer<br>and like i said i'm very pleased to be<br>and our interest in providing<br>information<br>recycling and packaging<br>has been able to be translated into some<br>of the issues that are being<br>investigated by consumer and so these<br>are all current<br>current campaigns with a view i hope to<br>kind of changing some of the ways in<br>which we do things<br>on one level it's about changing<br>behavior on another level for the<br>sunscreens for example it's about<br>changing changing the law<br>where are the standards for these<br>kinds of products at the moment there<br>aren't any standards<br>we rely entirely on a company to tell us<br>what's in them and what they do<br>um and one i'm really very pleased to be<br>part of is their recent<br>development of the built to last<br>campaign started in america as their<br>kind of right to repair<br>is now one of the major elements of what<br>consumer does<br>trying to encourage companies to move<br>away from some kind of planned<br>obsolescence which of course increases<br>the<br>opportunity for more and more production<br>and more and more consumption they go<br>hold on a minute we should have the<br>right to repair it<br>those little labels on the back of your<br>technical advice that says if you<br>actually if you come within five<br>meters of this the warranty will be um<br>disallowed<br>you're not allowed to unscrew anything<br>um<br>is well how does that fit with a kind of<br>innovative resourceful<br>resilient way in which we might kind of<br>keep things going<br>um and the last one i will mention on in<br>relation to a consumer is<br>again you know if we're trying to help<br>more people make better choices then we<br>need to provide them better information<br>and so we have got this um<br>relationship with the electricity<br>commission or authority<br>where we actually get a certain<br>percentage we get 25<br>for every person who goes on to power<br>switch to check<br>their power bill to work out what the<br>comparative costs are<br>from all the providers in the country<br>to work out what's the best is are they<br>on the best plan<br>we're working at the moment to try and<br>disentangle some of those plans because<br>it's quite hard sometimes to<br>work out just how much you're paying for<br>power if you've got your you know your<br>telephone and your<br>you know video and whatever video that<br>dates me a bit doesn't it<br>just pretend i didn't say video or your<br>digital device<br>um all wired into the same things or not<br>wired of course<br>um to enable people to make those kind<br>of choices we're still we're trying to<br>do the same with broadband<br>to provide people especially the people<br>who need it most<br>um with access to that information<br>however<br>the biggest group of people who<br>subscribe because it's a membership<br>organization there is no government<br>funding for consumer<br>i know this does sound like an advert so<br>i try not to make it seem too much like<br>an advert um<br>it's a subscription list but the most<br>most of the people on the subscription<br>list<br>are people who probably could afford<br>most of this<br>so how do we extend how do we extend<br>the opportunity to get this information<br>to a much wider group of people<br>and that's hopefully where some of my<br>experience and expertise might be useful<br>because we are struggling our membership<br>because they are comprised of a certain<br>age group of people shall we say um are<br>not<br>increasing how do we increase the<br>numbers of people at this end<br>how do we sustain should we sustain a<br>subscription model<br>we have one thing to sell really and<br>that is information<br>how do you sell information in this way<br>um<br>so that's what i'm kind of working on on<br>the next strategy meeting<br>we are pretty much getting close to<br>things now<br>all right i just saw somebody nodding<br>i'm not supposed<br>now no i don't think so um um<br>as i said uh hogman a you know i have my<br>scottish family<br>singing scottish songs and my uncle alec<br>reciting um<br>is there for honest poverty but i've<br>always it's always been at the back of<br>my mind that poem especially the last<br>verse where it says i'm hoping<br>that you know one time the optimism for<br>the future is that we do<br>kind of share things we do come together<br>we do work more collect<br>collectively and collaboratively um and<br>so<br>to robbie burns i have a great deal of<br>debt um<br>we the other the other element of hope<br>um<br>is that we belong to the future earth<br>global network people led by professor<br>maury cohen who's made a massive<br>impact um on looking at production and<br>consumption<br>around the world so we're very planned<br>proud to be part of that um<br>and although we can try and work on some<br>elements of consumer behavior<br>change attitudes beliefs opinions<br>at the same time what's happening and<br>you'll have seen in the news over the<br>last couple of days where some<br>governments around the world are being<br>taken to court by their<br>communities from failing to provide the<br>kind of care and<br>custody that they think they deserve<br>so is there an opportunity for this to<br>be developed through legislative<br>change as well through government<br>intervention or to changes to the law<br>and i'm very proud of the fact that the<br>wanganui river was one of the first<br>natural resources in the world to be<br>given citizenship status<br>which may have some lasting effect on<br>how the resource of a river<br>and so this is my last not my last slide<br>but almost my last slide um<br>which i think might be sort of but it is<br>time really to<br>say thank you to the people who have<br>particularly helped me<br>along the way um i'm going to start with<br>and my closest friends um so so and so<br>sorry this is a long list<br>but it's uh it's a bit i've been waiting<br>for actually<br>i don't mean because it's at the end i<br>mean because it's the people who are<br>mean most to me<br>so i'd like to give my grateful thanks<br>to dennis my brother for looking after<br>me through all his life<br>to jackie and stewart for looking after<br>dennis dave my son who's working as a<br>royal society for the protection of<br>birds warden um<br>in the biggest

aiken for his<br>excellent<br>lecture today professor aiken<br>has outlined to us the many influences<br>upon his research<br>and his academic journey in particular<br>the impact of his twitching<br>his interest in nature and his desire to<br>uncover<br>a holistic understanding of our<br>relationship with nature<br>rob has outlined his vast research<br>experience<br>and his contribution to business and the<br>community<br>and in particular the not-for-profit<br>sector<br>through his roles with age concern and<br>more recently<br>consumer new zealand it is very clear<br>the significant contribution that he has<br>made<br>rob has covered several of his research<br>themes in the lecture today<br>for quite some time<br>his passion for sustainability and<br>questioning the role that marketing<br>plays<br>is evident with his call for the need<br>for transformation<br>and transformative changes is how and<br>how we produce and consume things<br>with an extensive background in consumer<br>behaviour<br>rob has researched what motivates and<br>drives people to consume<br>sustainably and ethically what the<br>barriers are<br>to sustainable consumption and the role<br>and the importance of information and<br>marketing messages<br>and media and assisting consumers to<br>make sustainable choices<br>rob spoke of his research specifically<br>around ethics<br>and marketing and in particular the<br>fonterra<br>and the milken schools campaign<br>ultimately raising the question<br>around the role that marketing plays in<br>getting us into<br>and then out of trouble<br>it is very typical and fitting for<br>professorial lectures to focus on<br>research<br>but as many of you know the promotion 2<br>professor<br>requires sustained outstanding<br>leadership<br>around research service and teaching<br>and i believe that rob has consistently<br>demonstrated<br>all three rob's passion<br>for teaching is evidenced by his<br>numerous<br>and enviable teaching awards<br>rob's ability to communicate with<br>students<br>to encourage critical thinking and<br>application<br>and his all-round good humor and warm<br>personality<br>has driven his success and imparting<br>knowledge<br>to our large undergraduate and smaller<br>postgraduate classes<br>since embarking on his career as an<br>academic rob has<br>always been an effective popular<br>and engaging teacher so rob is an<br>excellent teacher he's an excellent<br>researcher<br>and yet he still finds time to be an<br>overall great citizen<br>within and outside the university<br>i've already mentioned his roles in age<br>concern and consumer new zealand<br>but until this year alongside those<br>positions<br>rob was our head of department for seven<br>years<br>it was a little gasp in the audience<br>when i said that<br>it's a long time to be in the role and<br>rob held that position<br>during a significant period of change<br>within the university<br>a challenging time for anyone but<br>especially for a head<br>rob was an excellent leader for our<br>department<br>stimulating and driving curriculum<br>development and research initiatives<br>and i think i speak for all of the<br>department when i say there was not one<br>time<br>when rob was too busy for us or in any<br>way<br>unapproachable his door was always open<br>his advice<br>words of wisdom and support at the ready<br>rob you are a people person it's no<br>wonder you ended up a professor of<br>marketing<br>since marketing is all about people and<br>value<br>and relationships your academic<br>contribution<br>is undoubtedly significant your work has<br>made a difference<br>in consumer behaviour in marketing<br>ethics<br>and sustainable consumption and your<br>service<br>contribution to our department division<br>university and community is<br>and alongside all of this i want to<br>personally thank you<br>as my colleague my mentor
