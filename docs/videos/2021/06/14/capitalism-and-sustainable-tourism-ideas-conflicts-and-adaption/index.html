However, this reimagination is often based on utopian ideals that are difficult to attain and doomed to fail. Utopia itself means ‘no place’. So, how can the future of tourism reconcile these utopian ideals with realistic perspectives? Is the future just a return to the past where unsustainable growth is the norm? What will regrowth or degrowth look like? What is the outlook for mass tourism from a sustainability perspective? How can we manage the worst of unsustainable behaviours? Right at the heart of these questions is the role of capitalism and business as a tourism system. We bring together a thinker, a leader, and a researcher who will delve into these questions to find answers.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be

speakers<br>and share this webinar on behalf of the<br>tourism group at victoria university of<br>wellington<br>today's topic is about capitalism and<br>sustainable tourism<br>this is of course a timely topic for<br>tourism scholars and<br>policy makers as we all know prior to<br>kovid 19<br>the tourism industry was among the<br>largest<br>and fastest growth activities worldwide<br>however the pandemic has dramatically<br>changed the policy context<br>of the tourism industry so<br>looking beyond the immediate challenges<br>that the travel industry is currently<br>facing<br>to minimize the the negative impacts of<br>the crisis<br>and foster safe travel many destinations<br>are nowadays exploring the opportunity<br>to rebuild or to<br>reimagine tourism and fast track<br>the move to more sustainable tourism<br>development<br>so this sustainable<br>vision for the future of tourism<br>is often based on utopian ideals<br>that are probably difficult to to<br>achieve<br>and do to to fail so<br>we have prepared a few questions to our<br>guest speakers<br>so our guest speakers will be covering<br>this topic and the questions<br>that we will be asking our guest<br>speakers to answer<br>are the following how can the future of<br>tourism<br>reconcile these utopian ideas<br>with realistic perspectives will the<br>postcovid<br>19 world be a return to the past<br>where tourism growth for development is<br>the norm<br>or are we going to rebuild a new models<br>of tourism development that is<br>characterized by<br>degree for livability which is more<br>focused on<br>the concept of community quality of life<br>and the principles of sustainable<br>development<br>how can we manage the worst<br>of unsustainable behaviors in the<br>context of<br>a balance between these two<br>paradigms so to answer these questions<br>we are fortunate to have three<br>distinguished<br>guest speakers from the uk and new<br>zealand<br>our first speaker is jim butcher who is<br>joining us<br>from the uk jim is a reader<br>at canterbury chris charles university<br>in the uk jim is an expert<br>on tourism and policy and he's a<br>defender<br>for the benefits of masteries<br>his topic is about<br>where's my jetpack a high-tech<br>future for leisure travel our second<br>guest<br>is chris roberts who is located in<br>wellington<br>chris has been the chief executive of<br>tourism industry aitaroa since 2014<br>his career includes journalism<br>working at the parliament and several<br>other corporate<br>positions chris presentations<br>would be about the role of the customers<br>in the future of trees and finally our<br>last guest speaker is rachel singleton<br>who is a prg researcher at ulster<br>university in the uk<br>rachel's research seeks to increase<br>pro-environmental beach user behavior<br>by using psychology and user centered<br>design<br>so her presentation would be about the<br>value of<br>the beach so each guest speaker will<br>have 10 minutes<br>a recorded version of this webinar will<br>be<br>available a few days later to all<br>participants<br>at this webinar and<br>people who are participating to to this<br>webinar are<br>able to ask questions at any time<br>you have just to use the chat function<br>and the<br>question and answers and as attendees<br>you are<br>also able to upvote the questions<br>indicating<br>which ones are most popular so<br>after the three presentations i'll be<br>selecting some of the most popular<br>questions<br>for our guests so that's all<br>i have to say at this stage so the floor<br>is now for gym to start<br>thanks okay thanks very much monday<br>thank you<br>um hopefully this will address the<br>questions when we're in<br>one way or another um where's my jet<br>pack sounds like a deaf question but<br>it's a question i think that we all<br>should be legitimately<br>uh asking at the moment it's the title<br>of a satirical book by daniel h<br>wilson he looks at the many futuristic<br>technologies optimistically featured in<br>science fiction<br>uh but and futuristic thinking but thus<br>far not delivered<br>read your little excerpt from it this is<br>um he talks about this book called skype<br>port a science fiction book written by<br>curt seodomak published in 1959<br>actually before the moon landings took<br>place<br>and this is a little excellent what is<br>this thing that's so revolutionary and<br>so daring<br>fantastic and at the same time logical<br>he looked steadily at lee his eyes<br>brightened as if an inner light had been<br>turned on<br>lee glanced at the architect and the<br>girl he found response in their faces<br>i need your assistance in building a<br>hotel in outer space<br>he said artlessly okay so<br>this was before buzz aldrin and neil<br>armstrong walked on the moon but they<br>were talking about moon hotels<br>okay we don't have them we don't have<br>them yet but it's worth noting that<br>thomas cook did set up a register<br>for people who wanted to be the first<br>people on the moon in 1954<br>which was even before the book was<br>written so that does<br>um indicate a certain ambition optimism<br>you might say naivety<br>and so on but certainly for some people<br>at that time<br>to adapt to well-known saying even the<br>sky was not the limit<br>so we don't have space hotels yet but<br>there are a lot of ideas that have one<br>way or another<br>uh come through from science fiction and<br>visionary thinking about the future<br>but just for a minute never mind the<br>future what about the past the<br>historical imagination<br>uh is very important i think to think<br>about where tourism<br>how it's developed in the past and judge<br>where we came from in order to get a<br>handle on how things may develop in the<br>future<br>in fact modern history has witnessed<br>remarkable innovations that would have<br>seemed futuristic<br>uh just a generation or two before they<br>actually became commonplace you know all<br>of these things<br>that developed over the last 200 years<br>that we take for granted<br>at one time or another were incredible<br>new<br>futuristic unthinkable<br>so imagine for example laborers in late<br>18th century britain<br>they would not have imagined that their<br>children would be taking trains from<br>industrial cities like manchester to<br>resorts on the coast like morkum that<br>would have been unbelievable that would<br>have been futuristic<br>that would have been beyond the limits<br>that people felt that you could<br>that you could go if you like think<br>about the package holiday revolution of<br>the 60s onwards where the masses flew<br>abroad<br>by jet propelled aircraft to places that<br>if they'd been abroad at all they would<br>have visited with a military<br>kit bag and a gun in world war ii in the<br>pre-jet<br>era this would this would have been an<br>extraordinary thing and certainly<br>would have been extraordinary today<br>grandparents for example<br>in the early 1900s cars were deemed to<br>be an incredible thing<br>um in the 1950s and 60s of all things<br>in britain motorways were celebrated<br>and eulogized about when the m1 was<br>built in the 1960s<br>of a weekend most of the traffic on it<br>was people just driving because<br>they wanted to drive on a motorway<br>because it was such a fantastic<br>new innovative uh thing of course we<br>don't seem to<br>we don't look at motorways in the same<br>uh same way today really<br>uh probably the kind of opposite uh way<br>but there it is people had a fascination<br>and a pride in<br>of all things the motorway<br>but i think those of us who are positive<br>about the incredible legacy of mass<br>tourism should not see ourselves only as<br>history takers from the past<br>but also as history makers for the<br>future able to conceive of the tourism<br>transformed once again<br>and i think what some of the science<br>fiction and the apparently mad cap<br>schemes remind us<br>of is to challenge something called<br>presentism<br>presentism normally refers to judging<br>the past<br>through the preoccupations of the<br>present when people look at history<br>through the eyes of the present but it<br>can also mean<br>doing something similar with regard to<br>the future<br>trying to envisage the future but<br>constrained by an inability<br>to think beyond the present levels of<br>technology<br>the present culture that we live in the<br>present form of social organization<br>and we become trapped in the present and<br>able to break out of that thinking<br>so this is where the futurology and the<br>science fiction come in<br>not necessarily so we dream of jetpacks<br>and moon hotels<br>although why not but really as a prompt<br>towards future-oriented thinking<br>we can imagine futures free from the<br>limits of the present<br>or at least prepared to push back those<br>limits we can imagine the use of<br>technology as an extension of trends<br>that are around now<br>this happens in science fiction a lot<br>and usually ends up in dystopian<br>directions<br>societies in which typically technology<br>comes to control us<br>or through which we lose a part of our<br>humanity or<br>high-tech societies in the aftermath of<br>nuclear war<br>but it can also be about imagining the<br>use of technology<br>free from the social arrangements and<br>culture we have now in a very positive<br>way in other words not dystopias<br>but utopias and i think that utopian<br>thinking has a lot to be said for it in<br>i think it is worth noting in passing<br>that there is a great deal of discussion<br>about technology and tourism<br>but it seems to me a great deal of it is<br>very much about personal technology<br>um and biometrics<br>the internet of things all of these kind<br>of things which are incredible<br>innovations<br>and are revolutionizing trouble already<br>of course there are critiques of that<br>emily thomas in a recent book on the<br>philosophy of travel<br>uh says that for all the great things<br>these bring as it does<br>mean wherever we go in the world every<br>one of us pretty much<br>is looking at the same screen looking at<br>the same google map<br>getting the same algorithm generated<br>advertisements<br>hinting where we might or might not go<br>but let's just leave that to one side<br>but a great deal of talk about tech a<br>great deal of innovation but i'm really<br>talking more about<br>transport getting us places<br>infrastructure civil engineering<br>investment that kind of thing so what<br>has all this got to do with capitalism<br>well i think a lot of the debate today<br>about tourism<br>uh postcode and regardless of that is<br>shaped by this presentism by these kind<br>of low horizons<br>where is the expansive future uh who's<br>talking about that whereby the 80 odd<br>percent of people<br>who do not travel internationally are<br>increasingly able to do so<br>what about imagining a society where the<br>east african coast<br>is as accessible for sun seekers as the<br>spanish costas<br>and what about a society where<br>sub-saharan africans<br>enjoy the sort of wealth and transport<br>infrastructure<br>possibly featuring elon musk's hyperloop<br>and drones to trans people from town to<br>airport both of those by the way exist<br>as prototypes already how about that and<br>them using that all on route to the<br>spanish costas on holiday themselves<br>i think it's the case that modern<br>capitalism lacks an inspiring vision of<br>a technologically informed<br>future there is a there is a<br>painfully slow development of new forms<br>of transport<br>i think in the time it's taken britain<br>not to build any runways<br>china has built probably approaching<br>three figures worth of airports and that<br>perhaps tells you something about the<br>stagnation of capitalism<br>in some of the more advanced countries<br>talking of china which may be regarded<br>as an exception<br>they're building what are known as<br>horizontal skyscrapers that resemble<br>something out of blade runner<br>um but without the dark post apocalyptic<br>vibe<br>without the replicants but probably with<br>so that's all well and good but it seems<br>to me that<br>critics of capitalism um may be actually<br>more limited still<br>in their outlook so we have a capitalism<br>that's<br>not particularly dynamic in many<br>respects but the critics are more<br>limited still<br>rather than demanding a tourism industry<br>that contributes to a society<br>that can systematically address poverty<br>and the<br>immobility that we that's associated<br>with poverty in the last parts of the<br>world<br>instead a lot of the opponents seem more<br>intent on coming to terms with those<br>limits<br>so one of the big talking points<br>certainly in the universities and i<br>think to a degree outside is de-growth<br>degrowth seeks of course de-growth in<br>other words<br>less growth in fact negative growth<br>and all that means um the growth also<br>holds a very dim view of the legacy of<br>growth mass tourism is typically<br>criticized<br>as having gone too fast in two great<br>numbers<br>and too far as well<br>so um in tourism terms this reverses the<br>trend i talked about earlier<br>um the trend to increase leisure<br>mobility and to view this as part of<br>social progress<br>it's now viewed in a rather dim<br>light with a lot of doubt and a lot of<br>angst<br>so this to me seems to be a sort of<br>radical huge acceptance of the limits<br>economic and cultural of our<br>contemporary society and it doesn't<br>challenge the presenters and i talked<br>house according to the world health<br>organization more than doubled the<br>number of people<br>who are at risk of starvation but d<br>growth is actually advocating a slim<br>down industry<br>steak staycations and really what<br>amounts to eco austerity<br>this to me is a pretty degraded<br>discussion of what's to be a new normal<br>it's one based upon caution and fear of<br>the environmental and cultural negatives<br>of growth and they exist and i don't<br>deny that<br>but it's dismissive of the potential<br>cultural and environmental benefits<br>of that growth and also um<br>it's accepting of the stultifying limits<br>of our society as it's constituted today<br>so the critical school is something of a<br>false critique<br>but it wasn't always thus i think that<br>capitalism's<br>critics in the past did have a more<br>optimistic<br>and more expansive view of what was good<br>and what was possible<br>in terms of economic growth and it<br>providing for people's wants and needs<br>for example both karl marx and john<br>maynard keynes<br>in the um 20th century had a vision of a<br>society<br>technologically informed that freed<br>people up to have more leisure time<br>and better able to develop themselves as<br>individuals<br>but i wanted to just kind of come to a<br>close here<br>by quoting something that was written by<br>bayard rustin<br>who um it's written in 1967<br>perhaps a slightly more optimistic<br>period than the one we live in<br>uh today in some respects and<br>um he was a civil rights activist and a<br>socialist<br>and here's what he wrote about leisure<br>and tourism in his time<br>my working-class constituents have their<br>own version of the environment which is<br>equally valid<br>and which calls for economic growth they<br>want lower housing densities and better<br>schools and hospitals<br>they want washing machines and<br>refrigerators to relieve domestic<br>drudgery<br>they want cars and the freedom they give<br>on weekends and holidays<br>they want packaged tour holidays to<br>majorca<br>even if the this means more noise of<br>night flights<br>and eating fish and chips on previously<br>secluded beaches<br>why should they not enjoy the sun and<br>they want these things<br>not because their minds have been<br>brainwashed and their tastes contrived<br>by advertising<br>but because these things are desirable<br>in themselves<br>so it seems to me if we're talking about<br>capitalism and we're talking about a new<br>normal and we're talking about critiques<br>of the way things are<br>um the success of any particular<br>critique<br>or alternative resides in its ability to<br>provide the things that<br>are as rusting said desirable in<br>themselves<br>and this is where i think we can do a<br>lot better we can go<br>further faster in great numbers if we<br>choose to do so<br>but it will require a little bit of<br>imagination<br>thank you thanks jim<br>thanks monda uh kyotato everyone<br>uh pleasure to be with you i've been<br>asked to talk about<br>the role of the customer in in the<br>rebuild<br>of tourism and i think the key issue<br>here is<br>who actually has the power and greatest<br>influence is it the operator<br>determining what product and service<br>they want to deliver where and when and<br>how<br>is it the government determining the<br>boundaries of<br>behaviour and the types of permitted<br>or encouraged activities ways of doing<br>things and the taxation<br>contribution that it requires so<br>government both as a steward<br>making sure that the tourism system is<br>operating<br>to some predetermined goals and that all<br>the participants have the right<br>incentives<br>information and the capability to play<br>their respective<br>roles in that system and the government<br>as an actor itself in the tourism system<br>directly through its investments and<br>interventions<br>such as the provision of infrastructure<br>and funding a<br>national tourism organization to address<br>market failure<br>is it the community determining what<br>sort of visitor activity it wants<br>happening in its backyard<br>and how it wants to protect its<br>environment and its community values<br>and is this community represented by<br>local government<br>representatives or is it a more<br>localized genuine community voice<br>or is it the visitor different visitors<br>with<br>different motivations to travel and with<br>different expectations<br>of what experience they will have and<br>the services and products that they wish<br>here in new zealand altearoa in recent<br>years the visitor or customer<br>has largely been excluded from the<br>debates around what sort of tourism do<br>we want<br>it's been fairly well presumed that the<br>new zealand tourism product is<br>so compelling that attracting visitors<br>is not really the key issue<br>even though the taxpayer does spend 112<br>million dollars a year through tourism<br>new zealand<br>marketing to those international<br>visitors<br>instead the focus has been on managing<br>or even reducing visitor numbers<br>protecting the environment hearing that<br>community voice<br>addressing social license concerns<br>fixing infrastructure deficits and<br>identifying new funding models new taxes<br>here at tourism industry in aotearoa we<br>believe we need to take<br>a balanced scorecard approach so our<br>tourism sustainability commitment<br>launched in 2017 sometimes seems a life<br>ago<br>a lifetime ago now has been widely<br>adopted by operators<br>large and small the tsc has<br>12 business level commitments across<br>four areas the environment the community<br>economic and visitor<br>no one area in the framework is given<br>more prominence than another<br>all need to be healthy and progressing<br>for the whole to work<br>at both an enterprise level and a<br>destination level<br>but in the wider public conversations<br>the visitor is so often taken for<br>granted or even somewhat demonized<br>the part of the system we obviously need<br>but somehow<br>we would prefer to do without perhaps<br>just send us your money and you can stay<br>at home<br>however as we gradually emerge from the<br>devastation wrought on global tourism by<br>the pandemic<br>where does the true power lie is it on<br>the supply side<br>new zealand is not alone in having a<br>public and government discussion about<br>building back better about reimagining<br>tourism about reshaping the future<br>those same conversations are happening<br>worldwide<br>but is the tourism recovery largely<br>going to happen<br>to us regardless<br>there will of course be some significant<br>supply side issues<br>two of the most important being when and<br>under what conditions governments<br>open their borders and then when and how<br>airlines<br>will provide services but could not the<br>single<br>biggest factor by some considerable<br>distance<br>be the desire of people to travel again<br>and where those desires take them<br>each traveller will make a personal<br>decision about where they go and when<br>it might be a business decision or a<br>desire to connect again with friends and<br>family<br>or to attend an event if it's a leisure<br>trip<br>they'll consider the usual factors when<br>deciding where to go on holiday<br>with an enhanced layer of safety and<br>risk management<br>there is only so much any destination<br>can do to manage this return of tourism<br>everyone can agree they want high value<br>visitors<br>even though no one can agree on a<br>definition of what a high value visitor<br>actually is<br>open sky agreements mean that pretty<br>much any airline can fly to a country<br>like new zealand<br>once they've secured a landing slot at<br>the airport<br>and met a few other requirements they<br>can then sell tickets on those planes to<br>anyone they want and as long as those<br>ticket buyers<br>meet new zealand's entry requirements<br>they are free to come<br>the government largely through its<br>national tourism organization<br>can try to market a target the marketing<br>messaging at certain types<br>of visitors those considered more<br>desirable<br>but this will likely only have an impact<br>on the fringes<br>a customer will make their choice based<br>on a range of factors<br>quite unique to them and that marketing<br>may or may not be one of those<br>influencing factors<br>so visitors will return in all shapes<br>and sizes<br>and the market will respond to those<br>visitors and provide the services and<br>products that they desire<br>for all the idealistic thinking our<br>ambition<br>and our genuine ambition to build a more<br>sustainable tourism future<br>these positions will most likely be<br>overwhelmed by the major drivers<br>demand plus affordable and convenient<br>travel options<br>that will deliver visitation in an<br>organic way<br>the customer has the greatest influence<br>and i expect<br>we will find that we have much less<br>control over what happens as tourism<br>rebuilds<br>thanks chris so we moved from the<br>the supply side to the demand side<br>and then now rachel is going to<br>to talk to us about the role<br>good morning and good evening depending<br>on where you're sitting right now i<br>am joining you from belfast where i'm<br>halfway through my phd<br>research at ulster university i'm<br>delighted to have this opportunity to<br>share with you<br>my approach to ensuring in a rapidly<br>changing landscape<br>that we sustain the value of the beach<br>to move from the limitations of either<br>that<br>unattainable space of utopia or from the<br>realm of unbinded and<br>unsustainable growth moving instead<br>towards something that seeks an everyday<br>reality<br>of sustained enjoyment of our beaches by<br>tourists<br>next slide please my approach<br>recognises that the continued provision<br>of those derived values<br>enjoyed by beach visitors plays an<br>integral part in sustaining our beaches<br>tourism offering<br>beach tourism has been described as the<br>largest tourism trade<br>but up to 97 of the economic value of<br>beach visits could be lost<br>through lower cleanliness standards<br>this reflects the finding that the<br>quality most valued by beach users is<br>clean sand and<br>clean water add to this the research<br>that shows that a doubling of litter<br>on a beach would lead to a 60 decline in<br>the length of style by tourists<br>alongside the current newsworthy<br>observations of soaring litter at our<br>beauty spots here in northern ireland<br>and<br>i'm quite sure elsewhere and we're faced<br>with a growing threat to sustainable<br>tourism<br>my approach focuses on beach user<br>littering<br>behavior and trying to change it<br>i'm going to introduce you to my two<br>study beaches and the first of which is<br>valley walter and then tarella<br>here in northern ireland and i'm going<br>to describe the approach that i'm taking<br>and to share with you what i've learned<br>so far<br>and how this can be used to inform<br>decision making that includes<br>so how am i approaching this well<br>by creating a methodology that blends<br>user-centered design<br>and the combi behavior change framework<br>in trying to understand what it is that<br>influences beach lettering behaviour<br>in beach users and identifying what will<br>reduce this with this i'm exploring<br>exploring behavioral enablers behavioral<br>inhibitors<br>as well as beach derived values that<br>influence behavior and i aim to use this<br>understanding<br>to inform a preliminary intervention<br>design<br>to reduce lettering throughout<br>this process i focus on the humans<br>behind the behavior<br>impacting on our beaches and i do this<br>with deliberate<br>direct engagement with these beach users<br>my research objectives are um if you<br>would go forward one slide please um<br>under i think that we're a wee bit out<br>thank you yeah<br>that's great thank you to understand<br>through the user engagement built into<br>user center design<br>what it is that influences each user's<br>lettering behavior<br>to define things and patterns as their<br>eyes so that this can inform the<br>co-design<br>of behavior change interventions to<br>identify<br>the intervention functions and behavior<br>change techniques<br>that are likely to be effective in<br>changing lettering behavior<br>to design and prototype an intervention<br>that can be applied<br>to targeting lettering behavior with the<br>potential to extend this<br>to implementation at other beaches in<br>northern ireland and<br>further afield and finally to measure to<br>measure<br>the usability of the intervention<br>through user testing<br>all of this is with the overarching<br>ultimately of ensuring that the beaches<br>value is retained<br>and that those derived values that are<br>enjoyed by its users<br>are sustained now understanding how<br>we can better sustain the immense<br>tourism offering of our beaches begins<br>with i believe better understanding what<br>this value comprises to the users<br>i started by reviewing literature that<br>outlines that considers<br>and that measures this and have<br>concluded that sex drive<br>values exist i think you're going to<br>need to go backwards for this one please<br>thank you that's perfect so with<br>northern ireland's tourism<br>um it's valued in economic terms<br>at 968 million and there are around<br>600 thousand trips taken annually in a<br>very small place<br>um by domestic tourists to northern<br>ireland's beaches<br>economic value is undeniably one facet<br>of our beaches and their tourism<br>offering<br>that said that's by no means the extent<br>of the value of reaches<br>there are five other derived values<br>identified through my research<br>the first being ecosystem and life<br>support value<br>and this is the dependency on nature in<br>order to live<br>then we've got aesthetic and landscape<br>value and<br>with landscapes being an integral part<br>of the natural environment it's<br>unsurprising<br>that they're considered a key pillar of<br>tourism<br>then we've got well-being value and<br>that's in the physical<br>mental and social space this is to such<br>an extent<br>that linking nature with domestic<br>tourism is considered central<br>to exploiting the potential for public<br>health initiatives to enhance<br>visitor well-being then we've got<br>interconnectedness value<br>and by that i mean a sense of connection<br>to something greater<br>a system of sorts as opposed to a siloed<br>existence<br>and finally spiritual and sacramental<br>value and in short<br>that's that sense of transcending the<br>everyday<br>i believe that understanding this helps<br>with identifying what drives speech<br>visits<br>and what if compromised threatens our<br>now i i mentioned that my work is user<br>centered<br>and in this context the users include<br>those employed in managing and those<br>concerned with maintaining the beach<br>whether through policy practice or<br>legislation<br>and then those recreational users<br>spending leisure time on the beach<br>i believe it's important to bring both<br>professional and recreational users to<br>the table<br>so that i can learn from their insights<br>their lived experiences<br>i've now completed 17 professional beach<br>user interviews<br>and i'm in the process of analyzing the<br>data and already<br>i can see that these values are<br>reflected in what are<br>at this point very preliminary insights<br>but i do look forward to delving deeper<br>my work<br>offers three key contributions the<br>theoretical<br>is identifying and seeking to fill a gap<br>in research regarding<br>the multidisciplinary approach and to<br>understanding<br>beach litter behavior and by that i mean<br>tourism<br>environment psychology and design<br>the methodological um and that's<br>that with this research i'm trying to<br>introduce and test a novel<br>blended methodology that integrates<br>design<br>and behavior change to understand user<br>behavior<br>and to inform the design of a behavior<br>change intervention<br>and practical providing a rigorous<br>and tested approach to providing new<br>ways for public sector agencies<br>and and others to experiment with<br>consumer relevant<br>that is<br>it's a space that doesn't require the<br>user to have awareness of sustainability<br>as a prerequisite<br>um it understands that um<br>green attitudes don't<br>aren't necessarily required for<br>pro-environmental behavior<br>and final slide please monitor i<br>started my research in september 2019<br>and six months later northern ireland<br>like much of the world<br>was in lockdown based in the department<br>of hospitality and tourism management<br>i was one of many wondering what the<br>future held<br>for colleagues in the tourism industry<br>and<br>naturally i also wondered and worried<br>about how relevant this left my research<br>14 months on and some initial emerging<br>insights from this first set of<br>interviews includes repeated<br>observations<br>of increased engagement in the beach<br>environment<br>increased numbers of visitors and<br>increased litter<br>there is extensive investment of time<br>money and labor and yet<br>those people responsible for managing<br>our beaches are faced with<br>increasing challenges where visitor<br>behaviors are concerned<br>now my research starts by bringing<br>psychology and design into the mix<br>the existing tourism and beach<br>environment realm<br>and keeping the beach user at the very<br>heart of it<br>and and this is from initial scoping<br>right through to<br>the design of a behavior change<br>intervention<br>we are undoubtedly faced with a rapidly<br>changing landscape or sustainable<br>tourism is concerned<br>and to address the rapidly evolving<br>challenges<br>i believe we would benefit from greater<br>insight<br>into the human behaviors of play and<br>from better understanding<br>of user needs so that we can meet them<br>i'm starting by accepting as i said that<br>behaving in a pro-environmental way<br>doesn't always happen due to<br>traditionally green<br>attitudes um or intentions<br>that the same person who recycles<br>may sometimes leave cigarette butts and<br>dreams<br>but litter bins can have a perverse<br>effect on lettering<br>i've started by seeking understanding<br>of what the beach brings to its users<br>the value<br>that they derive from it i'm working to<br>identify<br>what drives decision making whether that<br>be in<br>policy design beach management<br>operations<br>conservation local community and next<br>i'm conducting observation of user<br>behavior on the beaches<br>followed by interviews with those<br>recreational beach users and<br>and finally a sample of these users will<br>participate in the co-design<br>and the testing of this behavior change<br>intervention and and that's informed by<br>all of this<br>now my study aims not simply to<br>prototype<br>behavior change intervention but to<br>prototype a methodology<br>for approaching sustainable tourism<br>challenges<br>by taking an iterative approach<br>it allows for learning to be applied and<br>for the direction to be revised with<br>this learning<br>and it starts from the assumption that<br>better understanding through better<br>engagement with our tourists in general<br>and in this case beach users<br>professional and recreational in<br>particular<br>leads to better outcomes there are<br>two certainties here the first is that<br>we are<br>facing unprecedented change<br>and the second a constant is that at the<br>heart of tourism now<br>and always our people<br>i believe that we design for change<br>better<br>when we work alongside these people when<br>we learn from them<br>and we share the tackling of these<br>challenges with those humans whose<br>behavior<br>we're focusing on thank you<br>oh thanks rachel and good luck with your<br>phd<br>and we look forward to to reading the<br>outcomes of<br>your results so it's clear that<br>for you consumers are in the heart of<br>the<br>changes that we could expect in the<br>future<br>so now we'll be taking the questions<br>from<br>the floor i do have<br>i did receive a couple of questions<br>before we started this webinar the first<br>one<br>is from a consultant<br>in sustainability in tourism in europe<br>and his first question<br>is the following do you see a relation<br>between the awareness of a carbon<br>footprint<br>of a traveler and his or her social<br>economic behavior in the destination so<br>this is the first question i repeat<br>do you see a relation between the<br>awareness<br>of a carbon footprint of a traveler<br>and his or her social economic behavior<br>i could have a go at responding to that<br>monda<br>we hear a lot about the more conscious<br>traveler<br>and and those who deeply<br>care about sustainability but if you<br>look at<br>some of the of the existing schemes<br>for example offsetting your own travel<br>on a on a<br>on a plane uh most most of those<br>voluntary schemes run by airlines<br>um uh have about at best about seven or<br>eight percent<br>of passengers ticking the box to offset<br>their travel<br>so while it's an opt-in currently and<br>there's no<br>um no one i don't think is yet operating<br>an opt-out<br>carbon offsetting scheme there is<br>still only some travelers who have the<br>sustainability awareness<br>but certainly those travelers are seen<br>as desirable<br>by a market like new zealand and their<br>behavior once they get here<br>they are likely to be wanting an<br>authentic<br>experience um they may well<br>expect the services and products they<br>use to be<br>delivered in a sustainable way so<br>it is it is a market segment it's still<br>a small market segment it's<br>sometimes you would get the impression<br>that it's now the dominant approach<br>of the visitor i'm sure it will grow<br>further but it's<br>it's still just a relatively small part<br>of the overall market<br>thank you chris yes please jim<br>yeah just just briefly a comment really<br>i i think the whole carbon footprint<br>discussion is very very interesting one<br>um<br>one thing that it does is it it presents<br>the issue of<br>of carbon emissions at the level of<br>consumption<br>to an individual so the individual's<br>supposed to act<br>and reduce their carbon footprint and<br>that's going to solve the problem<br>i think there's there's some problems<br>with individualizing such an important<br>issue<br>as reducing carbon emissions in in that<br>way<br>first of all you have to question<br>whether it is really ethical because<br>as consumers it's very difficult to be<br>ethical<br>you don't travel to save the environment<br>but by virtue of not traveling<br>somebody doesn't get paid you know<br>you've got you can't win you can't have<br>it<br>this is a problem that will be and is<br>being addressed and<br>solved not quickly enough by<br>through technology i mean it's not<br>beyond the realms of possibility that<br>within<br>a few generations that will will be able<br>to<br>with the right kind of investment and<br>technology and commitment of course<br>that we will be looking at the prospect<br>of carbon you know relatively speaking<br>carbon free<br>flying you know all of these things are<br>being developed the prototypes are there<br>in the spirit of what i was saying<br>earlier in my talk you know we tend to<br>live in the presence and<br>of course carbon emissions are a massive<br>problem in the present but whether they<br>can be resolved simply by looking at<br>the current level of technology and and<br>encouraging consumers not to travel<br>and that damages economies i i think a<br>much better bet<br>is to really encourage uh you know<br>the innovation and and progressively<br>decouple<br>growth from carbon emissions and<br>i think one of the very exciting things<br>is for our students and for ourselves<br>um in our lifetimes this is something<br>that we can you know<br>thanks jim the second<br>question is from thailand and<br>someone is asking how can tourism<br>providers<br>reconcile the need for tourists to<br>return to thailand<br>without conflicting with the significant<br>majority of local people<br>who are much fearful<br>for coveted<br>for us here in the tourism industry in<br>new zealand we've made it very clear<br>that the safety of the local population<br>is the number one priority and those<br>decisions need to be made by the health<br>experts<br>guiding the government and so<br>borders should not open if there is<br>risk significant risk to the local<br>population<br>and governments<br>then need to work with their communities<br>to give them the reassurance that when<br>they take those decisions to open<br>borders that they've assessed all the<br>risks and they're managing the risks<br>last thing tourism wants is to be<br>blamed for uh risking the health of<br>of of the local population so i'm sure<br>that<br>situation would also apply in thailand<br>and anywhere else<br>and tourism industries are very also<br>sure are very careful<br>to be seen not to be putting the dollar<br>ahead of of the health of their<br>communities<br>so we've always been very clear the<br>decisions on when<br>new zealand opens up to other countries<br>is for the government to take<br>guided by health advice in in taking a<br>risk<br>based approach and keeping the risk as<br>low as practical um<br>and if that's done then when the borders<br>do<br>open then the community should be on the<br>whole<br>supportive and welcoming of those<br>visitors coming back<br>comments yes yes um<br>i also work within the northern ireland<br>government um<br>and that role involves some of the<br>transmission<br>and behavior advice um i'm a behavioral<br>scientist there<br>and i think that what has come across is<br>the importance of<br>very clear messaging that people receive<br>and a great degree of consistency<br>um and and in order for that<br>for that to that sense of safety um<br>and and a degree of predictability when<br>it comes to what measures<br>um need to be undertaken in order to to<br>protect yourself<br>and knowing in advance how that's likely<br>to impact as<br>somebody going into another country or<br>another jurisdiction<br>and being able to almost work through<br>that process in advance<br>can lead to greater confidence and i<br>appreciate i think the question was from<br>the other side of things um tourists<br>coming into the country<br>um but it's just something that's that's<br>also relevant<br>um for for tourists too to travel<br>elsewhere<br>okay thank you so<br>the third question is from<br>new zealand what are the dangers<br>of the growth from the perspective<br>of the sustainable development goals of<br>the u.n<br>so what are the dangers of de-growth<br>from the std's perspective<br>ah we can't hear you we can't hear you<br>okay okay sorry the dangerous degrowth<br>from the perspective of the sdgs well<br>in in general let me let me just briefly<br>address it in<br>in terms of the dangers of degrowth in<br>terms of development<br>um i think that there are different<br>things here and<br>i understand when rachel's talking about<br>d growth she's talking about<br>policies and things that you know at the<br>level of the beach or the locality<br>i'm i i was generally referring to<br>d growth as a development philosophy<br>which is<br>very popular amongst geographers and<br>tourism geographers and other academics<br>and the argument of d growth as a<br>development philosophy<br>is that the world should literally grow<br>that the world is too global the economy<br>should shrink become more localized<br>reliant on local resources and that<br>would include things like<br>you know people being more rooted in<br>terms of<br>of tourism and i think that the growth<br>is absolutely<br>disastrous for the sustainable<br>development goals<br>um it takes economies backwards<br>it um flies in the face of economic<br>principles like the division of labour<br>um comparative advantage and so on<br>and it has been rightly described by<br>commentators like lee phillips<br>and branco milanovich ex-world bank<br>economist as<br>and i really can't stress enough how<br>much i am<br>against the current fashion for talking<br>up d<br>growth in tourism absolutely individual<br>policies at a local level can make a<br>great deal of sense<br>small-scale tourism eco doesn't they can<br>make sense in this time in this place<br>and so on but as a development<br>philosophy um<br>it it it's it has you know this is a<br>debate in development economics and so<br>on but<br>in my opinion it would be devastating<br>and<br>just bear in mind you know we're just<br>coming out hopefully of of kobe 19.<br>um i actually don't think we fully<br>comprehend<br>the horror of<br>of that in our own societies it's been<br>bad enough<br>but um i think the effect<br>you know in certain parts of the poorer<br>parts of the world economically poorer<br>parts of the world<br>are absolutely terrifying and of course<br>many of those societies don't have the<br>economic capacity to furlough workers<br>that kind of thing<br>a lot of hospitality employment is in<br>the informal economy<br>and there's been nothing to fall back on<br>so i want growth absolutely growth<br>i don't want growth at all costs<br>and i don't want unplanned growth and<br>just link to one of the other questions<br>i think that was on the<br>web here i think the really key thing<br>about growth is to try and bring it more<br>closely under democratic control<br>and you see the demands for that in<br>cities like barcelona and amsterdam<br>but there are very few people i can tell<br>you in the developing world<br>favoring d growth for kind of obvious<br>reasons<br>thanks thank you thank you jim<br>chris would you like to make comments<br>from new zealand's perspective<br>about this topic<br>no i think jim covered that quite well<br>but so i'm happy to<br>leap on to that one of the next<br>questions yes<br>yes so this is the yes<br>this is the question can you see the<br>question yes yeah<br>perfect so yeah so christopher<br>yeah there's a question there about um<br>capitalism being a driver of tourism<br>development<br>but focusing in the past mostly on the<br>economic benefits of the visitor<br>rather than rather than the well-being<br>of the community<br>i do agree with that and we need to have<br>a better balance<br>one thing we're in discussions here<br>currently with<br>tourism new zealand the government's<br>marketing agency<br>is around defining uh what we mean by a<br>high value visitor<br>and as i said earlier every country<br>wants to attract high value visitors but<br>very few are able to define what they<br>mean by that<br>and in the past it's generally been<br>about someone who spends a lot of money<br>i think what we're really talking about<br>or we need to talk about is a high<br>quality visitor and that's not just<br>about<br>the money they spend it's about the<br>attitude they bring with them<br>to the place they're visiting it's<br>about the time of year they travel it's<br>about where they travel it's about the<br>type of activities they<br>undertake it may well be about their own<br>carbon<br>footprint uh you know what impact do<br>they have on climate change and getting<br>to that destination<br>um how do they travel once they're there<br>so we're starting some work on<br>on a far broader definition of<br>of what this uh desirable<br>traveler looks like what is this high<br>value or high quality visitor<br>and it has to go way well beyond the<br>previous definitions<br>of a visitor who spends a lot of money<br>oh thank you thanks chris chris there is<br>another question<br>with regard to new zealand i don't know<br>whether you can see the<br>the question here can you see<br>this the one about uh our control over<br>visitor arrivals<br>yes so obviously where we sit on the<br>planet we do have more control over<br>visitor arrivals than some other<br>countries and that's<br>one factor why new zealand's been so<br>successful in managing covert<br>could we use the question asked could we<br>use tourist visas to shape<br>the return of international tourism i<br>my belief is not really unless we<br>took some radical steps and damaged our<br>international relationships<br>to a serious degree<br>we have long standing arrangements that<br>allow<br>60 plus countries that come here without<br>a visa<br>and so we have no control over who comes<br>from those countries<br>and then from the other countries that<br>do require visas<br>there's some fairly standard<br>requirements that they have to show<br>essentially to show that they can<br>support themselves and they will return<br>to that country<br>of origin after they've been here as a<br>visitor<br>you you could attempt to use the border<br>to control who comes<br>by by requiring a visa from everyone<br>and requiring some sort of evidence that<br>they<br>will um again come back into the spend<br>will spend lots of money while they're<br>here<br>but i think the potential risk to<br>country to country relationships would<br>be massive if we started trying to<br>oppose those conditions on other<br>countries<br>and the potential for um reciprocal<br>actions by those countries and we've<br>seen that before<br>a few years ago new zealand decided to<br>require south africans to get a visa<br>before coming to new zealand and<br>previously they did not require a visa<br>south africa responded within days and<br>required visas from new zealanders going<br>the other way<br>um so you have to be very careful about<br>international reactions<br>uh if you try to use the border as the<br>tool<br>to manage uh the types of visitors that<br>apologies i said jim this might be<br>question for you can you see the<br>question<br>sorry um i can see a lot of questions<br>did you have one in mind<br>yeah how can we encourage sustainability<br>within the eco-tourism<br>destination when economies in developing<br>countries are struggling<br>economically from the impact of covet<br>19.<br>yeah okay um i know the person asking<br>this question<br>so um okay<br>it's an interesting question i mean i i<br>guess what lies behind<br>the question is is the idea that because<br>of kobe 19<br>rural communities will be really<br>desperate for economic development and<br>therefore may not<br>um pay so much attention to the form of<br>that economic development<br>and ensuring that it's sustainable and<br>so on<br>um i i don't have a clear answer to that<br>necessarily i mean i<br>i think one of the things about<br>ecotourism is<br>in rural areas is that it can be a very<br>good innovative<br>of of bringing the degree of wealth<br>not a great deal of wealth but a degree<br>of wealth to rural communities<br>and benefiting the economy in that way<br>and so on but um<br>i don't agree that ecotourism<br>eco-tourism should have the sort of<br>fated status as<br>a sustainable form of tourism that it<br>has you know there is this kind of idea<br>that ecotourism is almost regarded as a<br>development philosophy<br>for for rural development because it<br>does bring together<br>conservation and development sort of<br>symbiotically<br>and therefore is regarded as sustainable<br>development<br>um the the problem with ecotourism<br>is is that um as a development<br>philosophy<br>it kind of says to communities you you<br>can bring tourists and you can have a<br>degree of wealth based on that<br>but then it stops you know that then it<br>then the development is<br>limited because of the um notion<br>that um you know the environment should<br>not be changed and therefore<br>um you know it kind of<br>promises development also kind of puts a<br>sort of conceptual cap on how far<br>uh that that can go so i guess if my<br>answer um tia<br>is um i wish the community's<br>good luck in trying to leverage economic<br>development<br>um on in the form of eco tourism but<br>also well beyond that<br>because as you know yourself rural<br>thailand in the north especially<br>um would benefit economically a great<br>deal<br>from better transport links you know<br>from infrastructure<br>um in order to develop tourism and other<br>industries<br>as well and and uh you know<br>localized ecotourism projects are one<br>thing but infrastructure that links the<br>local to the national and the<br>international<br>i think are actually more important as a<br>form of development<br>so um i look forward to those<br>developments as well as<br>not instead of the important ecotourism<br>projects that i know that you're<br>very passionate about thank you<br>thanks jim i think we're richard it's 10<br>15 and we<br>we we mentioned that we will finish at<br>10 15. i'm sorry if i<br>i wasn't able to cover all the questions<br>so on behalf of the tourism group i<br>would like to thank you for your<br>contributions to this seminar especially<br>for people who are currently in uh in<br>europe so it's a bit late for you it's<br>11 15 i think you know 11 15<br>p.m your time i think so thank you for<br>for being with us<br>uh thanks uh chris for uh<br>your contribution from a new zealand<br>perspective so on behalf of the tourism<br>group i would like to thank you<br>for uh for for for this contribution and<br>um<br>just would like to advise um<br>the participants that we have a webinar<br>uh no it would be no sorry a seminar and<br>not webinar<br>that will be organized on the 29th of<br>june at victoria university from 1 to 2<br>p.m<br>and the speaker<br>is one of our former phd student hiker<br>who will be joining us from university<br>of<br>from oakland university aut in in<br>in auckland so thank you again<br>for for jim for rachel and chris for<br>your contributions<br>and thanks abby for organizing uh<br>this webinar for us so have a lovely<br>day chris have a good evening uh jim<br>and rachel and hopefully we will see you<br>as a participant to our webinars or<br>seminars next time
