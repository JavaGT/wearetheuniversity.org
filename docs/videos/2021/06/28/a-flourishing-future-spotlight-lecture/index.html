So, it’s important good public policies for wellbeing which enable and support this to happen are created. But how do we ensure that policies designed to improve the wellbeing of society and people address any inequities and are sustainable to ensure intergenerational wellbeing for all?<br><br>In this public lecture, Sophie Handford (Councillor, Kāpiti Coast District Council) and Professor Girol Karacaoglu (Head of School of Government, Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington) discuss what must be done to ensure that public policy improves and sustains intergenerational wellbeing.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically

thank<br>melanie lauren and leah from our<br>marketing team for making this possible<br>and i'm also delighted that sophie<br>hanford<br>was able to join me in this lecture<br>because<br>she is the future and i'm the history<br>sophie is the<br>counselor from capitol court district<br>council she<br>will have more to say about yourself<br>know that<br>and i'm the head of school of government<br>at victoria university of wellington<br>topic of the presentation is can public<br>policy improve and sustain<br>intergenerational well-being my answer<br>is an<br>emphatic yes but a highly qualified yes<br>because if we are going to achieve this<br>aspiration<br>i advocate and propose that<br>it requires a radically different<br>approach to the design<br>and implementation of public policy<br>one that requires imagining big<br>large but thinking<br>and doing small extremely well<br>and making sure that those small things<br>that are done very well are properly<br>connected and scaled up<br>so they have the impact that's required<br>of them<br>i'm delighted to share the conversation<br>with sophie<br>because whatever we propose and pursue<br>towards improving<br>and sustaining intergenerational<br>well-being<br>requires her generations deep<br>engagement with both the processes<br>involved<br>and the outcomes that we aspire to<br>achieve<br>one big theme is process matters as well<br>as<br>outcomes indeed my main motivation for<br>participating in this joint lecture<br>is to provide wider background and<br>context for just 10<br>minutes as well as publicity<br>in the exceptional work sophie's<br>generation<br>are doing while also giving her an<br>opportunity to highlight<br>the kind of support she and her<br>generation<br>need in order to succeed for the present<br>and the future<br>the intellectual origins of the approach<br>i outline here<br>can be found in the book small is<br>beautiful<br>a study of economics as if people matter<br>published in 1973 by ernst<br>schumacher the title smallest beautiful<br>came from a principal espoused by<br>schumacher's teacher<br>leopold core advancing small<br>appropriate technologies policies and<br>polities<br>as a superior alternative to the<br>mainstream<br>ethos of bigger is better<br>and that book was written and became one<br>of the most influential<br>books ever in a context exactly like<br>ours<br>where there were severe broader<br>environmental social economic and<br>political pressures mounting around the<br>world<br>achieving sustainable intergenerational<br>well-being<br>requires as i said as much focus<br>on processes as well as outcomes<br>by way of analogy i<br>show the following picture which i have<br>stolen from professor ottmar winkler<br>in a brilliant book he's a statistician<br>he refers to it<br>as a macroscope as distinct from a<br>microscope<br>this image is a composite of many small<br>rectangular pictures although each of<br>them<br>may represent micro phenomena that are<br>important in their own contexts<br>together they form a larger picture that<br>is quite different<br>from the many small pictures that<br>compose it<br>like color stones composing a mosaic<br>while this joint picture is not very<br>sharp<br>the intention of the image is clearly<br>discernible<br>in an analogous manner individual<br>isolated facts and acts of communities<br>across society together form the<br>respective environmental<br>social political and economic phenomena<br>that matter for our collective<br>well-being today and into the distant<br>future<br>the challenge is how do we aggregate<br>and support them there are thousands and<br>thousands of<br>uh community activities going on<br>even in our small country i'll give one<br>or two examples and um<br>sophie will of course develop her own<br>work<br>uh very briefly one of them is coming<br>from wellington<br>it recently established mental health<br>and well-being commission<br>has reached out to hundreds of community<br>activities trying to find out what they<br>are doing on mental health<br>and trying to aggregate and connect them<br>the people's project in hamilton and<br>taranga<br>deal with homeless people in very<br>effective ways very frustrated<br>that they have not had the support to<br>enlarge and<br>upscale that we have in nelson<br>the tetarihi intergenerational strategy<br>the strategy has been culminating in<br>thinking analysis and work that has been<br>convened by the waikato incorporation in<br>partnership<br>with councils ewe local business<br>regional development agency and so on<br>to try to bring all of them together to<br>imagine a different<br>future that will be helpful for future<br>generations<br>and there are many many more examples i<br>can give<br>all these efforts around new zealand<br>that are very much focused on engaging<br>with communities towards building<br>resilience<br>in the social political environmental<br>and economic domains<br>have revealed one major gap<br>at present there is no institutional<br>infrastructure<br>in new zealand that connects and<br>aggregates<br>these efforts towards learning from each<br>other<br>as well as exploring ways of increasing<br>scale and impact<br>and by connecting raising the<br>possibility of<br>accessing more funds<br>nor do we have the equivalent of what<br>works well-being in the uk that<br>separates what works and what does not<br>work<br>in all these community trials so that we<br>can support and scale up<br>and fund what works we have a micro<br>image of it<br>in the form of our impact lab it's a<br>very small<br>ngo kind of experiment but it can be<br>easily scaled up if we have the<br>imagination<br>going back to the figure on the screen<br>it is critical to note<br>that the image that will emerge from the<br>collection of thousands of such<br>spontaneous self-organizations<br>spontaneous self-organizations as<br>michael pollani refers to them<br>cannot be predetermined you cannot<br>predetermine the picture that will<br>emerge<br>nor should we try to predetermine them<br>if we genuinely believe that people have<br>the right<br>and communities to live the lives they<br>value today and into the future<br>the distinctive role of public policy<br>that is focused on<br>enhancing well-being in a sustainable<br>well the way<br>is to set up governance structures that<br>will allow the aggregated image of these<br>thousands of community efforts to evolve<br>sustainably into the indefinite future<br>without pre-design that is without<br>predetermining<br>the ultimate shape or destination or<br>what will happen<br>the focus of public policy in that<br>context<br>changes from direction from the center<br>to nourishment and support to enable<br>people and communities to live the lives<br>they value<br>this is the radical difference between<br>policy making<br>with a social planner mentality<br>the mentality in new zealand for as long<br>as we can remember<br>and a gardener mentality which is what<br>i'm advocating<br>having said that although we cannot<br>prejudge and predetermine the picture<br>that will emerge from these thousands of<br>activities<br>the gardener has a very distinctive role<br>it is to keep an eye on the health of<br>the garden<br>making sure that its vital signs are<br>looked after<br>and no critical boundaries are crossed<br>i represent the well-being garden that<br>the public policymakers should be<br>watching<br>from the moon or from the silos of<br>wellington<br>in the part in this particular way with<br>the corners<br>being the vital signs that we need for<br>sustainability<br>such as environmental quality social<br>cohesion<br>and on it goes those are the key<br>systemic outcomes<br>that we should be monitoring and we<br>should make sure<br>that we don't cross them while at the<br>same time<br>we are investing what's in the middle of<br>the diagram<br>which i refer to as ecosystems which are<br>all focused on building resilience<br>if we do that then the garden expands<br>the playground expands<br>and we have more space to play and live<br>and pray and enjoy ourselves without<br>this can be achieved through a set of<br>complementary investments<br>in the ecosystems that sit right in the<br>middle<br>all focused on building resilience<br>having two dimensions<br>power to absorb pain and power to bounce<br>back creatively from the shocks<br>this is where process becomes critical<br>none of these ecosystems can be<br>strengthened in a sustainable well<br>way without deep effective and enduring<br>community<br>engagement towards building resilience<br>however nor can they be achieved without<br>appropriate<br>macro level investments of the sort that<br>the infrastructure commission and its<br>likes should be monitoring and<br>supporting<br>legislation infrastructures looking<br>across and saying what kind of<br>legislation say resource management act<br>what quality standards should be imposed<br>on water across the country<br>across health services across education<br>wi-fi to support connectedness and on it<br>goes<br>that's the mind frame what can i do to<br>support<br>at the macro level the kind of<br>activities that are<br>we have some governance challenges to<br>support these and i enumerate them and<br>then i'll pass them on to sophie<br>have as it happens the future of local<br>government review that provides a<br>brilliant catalyst<br>initiated in april 2021<br>for reimagining the interaction<br>between local and regional on the one<br>hand<br>government and its communities as well<br>what systemic institutions do we need to<br>create to help us develop a holistic<br>view<br>of all the community level initiatives<br>that are going on in new zealand<br>with a view to connecting and supporting<br>them appropriately<br>what monitoring evaluating and reporting<br>mechanisms do we need<br>to put in place to ensure that the<br>collective impact of these changes<br>is just and viable just in other words<br>fair<br>equitable and viable in other words we<br>don't cross any of the vital boundaries<br>in in support of intergenerational<br>well-being<br>i am not hallucinating such an<br>institution exists<br>in wales the future generations<br>commissioner<br>what are the distinctive but<br>complementary roles of central and local<br>governance<br>in this context towards ensuring genuine<br>and comprehensive community<br>engagement as distinct from consultation<br>the dpnc have issued a document about<br>community<br>and if you read it it's all about<br>consultation they miss it<br>it's not about engagement which is the<br>critical issue<br>not only vertical but also horizontal<br>engagement<br>in identifying and prioritizing local<br>and finally what funding mechanisms and<br>supporting accountabilities<br>do we need to put in place to ensure<br>that these initiatives are properly<br>resourced evaluated and scaled up<br>if successful and shut down if not<br>think of the participatory budgeting<br>charter of scotland<br>and in our backyard brilliant work<br>principal advisor new zealand treasury<br>ken warren<br>just published his paper on our website<br>institute of governance and policy<br>studies<br>designing a new collective operating and<br>funding model<br>in the new zealand public sector so we<br>can appropriately fund<br>such initiatives without compromising<br>accountability or fiscal discipline<br>to summarize i firmly believe<br>that sustainable intergenerational<br>well-being is absolutely possible<br>however unless we have a change of<br>mindset<br>we have it in an imagination and we are<br>able and willing to think and do things<br>differently<br>it simply will not happen thank you<br>my name's sophie and as skiro perfectly<br>laid out the challenges<br>and now handed it over to me to somehow<br>describe to you and depict to you<br>the vision for the solutions in 15<br>minutes i don't think i'll be able to do<br>that but i'll give it my best shot<br>from talking through some of my<br>experiences what i've learned from those<br>and how i think we can better strengthen<br>intergenerational relationships but also<br>strengthen relationships across<br>communities for change<br>so from primary school till now and i<br>will continue to hopefully be curious<br>that's one of the traits that i think a<br>lot of us well i've even found this now<br>being on council i'm kind of you start<br>to lose it because you get so<br>focused on all of these details around<br>you<br>and staying grounded in your curiousness<br>your curiosity<br>and also your why has been an extremely<br>important thing for me to learn but when<br>i was 12 i remember<br>very vividly my parents getting a letter<br>in the mail from our local council<br>essentially setting out this challenge<br>right in front of them<br>and this leader said look you live by<br>the beach<br>climate change sea level rise you're<br>going to need to think a little bit<br>about<br>your property you're going to need to<br>think of it about where you're living<br>right now<br>and i have this vivid memory of them<br>sitting around the table when i was 12<br>and i asked them a question<br>about what was in this letter i was<br>curious and they started to explain it<br>to me and i just felt this kind of sense<br>of fear almost this<br>paralysis by fear rippling through me<br>going<br>this is this is my future yet i have not<br>been<br>told about this i haven't been asked<br>about what i think<br>about climate change about sea level<br>rise about what we can do to fix it why<br>not<br>and so i invited my local mp to speak to<br>my class at 12 years old and put that<br>question to him<br>very simply i said look what are you<br>doing<br>to protect my future as a young person<br>to protect this collective planet that<br>we share that's our home<br>and he said something along the lines of<br>well that question would be better put<br>to our climate minister<br>maybe you should ask him and i thought<br>no<br>nope sorry i'm not taking that because<br>actually<br>if i feel the sense of fear i'm part of<br>your community so you you're answerable<br>to me and to my generation too so that<br>kind of then<br>led me down this path of trying to be<br>curious<br>trying to understand why we're in the<br>situation that we're in and what i can<br>do to be a part of the solution<br>in high school the same thing got<br>involved with ecoaction group and<br>started trying to do my bit<br>and found little opportunities too but<br>when i left high school i thought well<br>i'm not actually going to go to<br>university because<br>i don't know what i can study that will<br>give me<br>any more than what i already kind of<br>know we need to do and we just need to<br>get down to doing<br>the mahi to doing the work i think a lot<br>of us<br>are grounded in and understand what<br>needs to be done so<br>just as girl said what's actually<br>stopping us<br>and i think mindset is a lot of that<br>and also getting caught up in a whole<br>lot of process<br>and getting caught up in a whole lot of<br>stuff that actually when we<br>strip things down what is actually<br>needed<br>to get us to the outcomes that our<br>communities and our planet so<br>desperately need<br>not for us without us that's how a<br>little bit how i felt<br>sitting around the council table being<br>the only counsellor under 40<br>and we're talking about our long-term<br>plan we're talking about a vision for<br>carpeting<br>in 20 years but i'm the only person i'm<br>20 now and the only person under 40<br>that's sitting around that table being<br>able<br>to vote and really have a say about our<br>long<br>term vision we only had one primary<br>school submit to our council and that's<br>because the resources weren't put aside<br>to have that engagement with schools but<br>instead<br>that money was put towards engaging with<br>businesses was put towards engaging with<br>residents associations was put towards<br>engaging with groups like that<br>but long-term planning how can we have a<br>conversation about long-term planning<br>when we do not have not only the future<br>of our country and our world<br>at that table but i would also encourage<br>you to think of young people<br>as the here and now too we're all the<br>here and now<br>we're all here in this present moment<br>which means we all have a responsibility<br>but also an opportunity to be a part of<br>the solution<br>so so i guess what kind of grounds me<br>and all of that is my why<br>and as we scale up and as we have<br>conversations about how<br>things need to look in the future how<br>processes need to<br>look need to look to deliver public<br>policy that's suited to our people<br>our diverse communities and our planet i<br>encourage you all to think of<br>why for you this is a really important<br>plight<br>and fight to be involved with so my why<br>is wanting to know and say that i did<br>absolutely everything in my power to<br>ensure that the world we're passing on<br>is one that's livable beautiful and<br>sustainable<br>one where balance between us and the<br>environment is restored<br>so i'd encourage you to think of your<br>why as we have these conversations these<br>quite challenging conversations<br>about how we do scale up and also how we<br>scale back<br>i think too we talk a lot about scaling<br>up growing things<br>you know focusing on where we can get<br>more resource from to put it somewhere<br>else<br>but actually what i found and i'll touch<br>on a few stories is that simplicity<br>i truly believe is beautiful and similar<br>to what girl said as well<br>looking at those small pieces of the<br>puzzle<br>is beautiful and mindset can shift all<br>of that<br>so back in 2019 at the beginning of 2019<br>a few friends<br>friends and i got together and we said<br>okay we've got this kind of<br>fear that we feel deeply in our hearts<br>and our souls about the kind of future<br>that we'll be passing on to the next<br>generation<br>how can we do something about it so we<br>rallied a few of our friends and started<br>the school strike for climate movement<br>here in new zealand and very quickly<br>and without a whole heap of money um<br>without a whole heap of<br>of kind of support in the beginning and<br>actually with quite a bit of pushback<br>from<br>from people in in our communities and<br>from people who we actually needed the<br>support of<br>we managed to mobilize 170 000 people in<br>september that's 3.5 percent of our<br>entire population<br>for climate justice we organized that<br>strike on less than two thousand dollars<br>we managed to have a network of about 40<br>people across the country having only<br>met each other once<br>and all of that we were able to do on<br>zoom i never thought it was possible<br>probably many of you would have never<br>said that was possible if a group of us<br>from the age of ages of 8<br>to 21 were here in front of you saying<br>we want to organise<br>a strike for climate justice and we want<br>to mobilise<br>tens potentially hundreds hundreds of<br>thousands of people<br>but we did it and there were<br>eight-year-olds involved with that they<br>had just as much<br>of a say and actually they had<br>incredible things to bring to the table<br>because they represented their own<br>perspective<br>and their own viewpoint but we kept it<br>real simple<br>we just said look if you want to be a<br>coordinator for your region go for it<br>here are some resources but you know we<br>trust you just make it happen<br>so we kept it real simple team of all<br>ages little budget<br>completely new movement council the team<br>that i had that helped me to get elected<br>to council<br>none of them could even vote for me they<br>were either too young<br>or didn't live in the ward in which i<br>was running and i won by more votes than<br>both candidates had<br>combined and so no one would have said<br>that was possible but we knew that we<br>wanted to try<br>and we knew that if we just kept the<br>campaign simple a simple message but a<br>message that had truth and was grounded<br>in a why<br>and that we could clearly articulate and<br>that we had a vision<br>you know we didn't know how far we could<br>go but we thought we could go pretty far<br>and we we believed in that and so now<br>i'm actually on council<br>and i'm finding that there's there's so<br>much noise<br>there's so much talk and there's there's<br>so much<br>it's so dense all of the information<br>we're receiving it's so dense and all<br>the conversations are two and there are<br>elements of that which i love<br>but i also think back to how much has<br>been achieved and how much will continue<br>to be achieved<br>by small groups of people with not a lot<br>of resource<br>who are just truly passionate about what<br>they<br>do and so i say all power to those<br>people and all power to those groups and<br>all power to the knowledge<br>that they bring because that was<br>something i was met with a lot<br>by people who were older than myself we<br>did a whole lot of door knocking on my<br>council campaign<br>and the main thing i was met with was i<br>was either<br>oh how old are you and i was like oh i'm<br>18.<br>oh what are your credentials what have<br>you studied you know what kind of<br>real world experience do you have and<br>actually<br>i i kind of almost thought to myself<br>well i've<br>i've come up against some pretty<br>challenging things<br>and there are lots of young people who<br>have and<br>especially being a young person in this<br>day and age with the impacts and the<br>kind of<br>um i guess effects of technology and the<br>density of information too available to<br>us at the<br>tip of our fingers and social media and<br>this age of comparison<br>i kind of just said you know what i<br>actually do have<br>valid experience so i think part of this<br>is about young people<br>kind of being able to stand in that and<br>go yes we do have<br>we are we are valuable we are valid in<br>this conversation<br>listen and that's what i'm finding in<br>council is i do have to exert that<br>otherwise i will just continue to be<br>pushed to the sidelines but i'm not<br>willing to let that happen but<br>we do need to make sure these spaces are<br>prepared well<br>so that young people are in they're able<br>to contribute in the way that i think we<br>best know how i best know how anyway<br>so how do we collectively and<br>intergenerationally<br>move forwards and scale up<br>this is a big question a very big<br>question<br>i think we're aware of what needs to<br>happen<br>we're aware of potential ways that we<br>could<br>we could scale up and there's there's<br>real<br>kind of excitement and hope i think that<br>comes from that<br>i think it's easier than we think i<br>think it's just all about priorities<br>because we have a limited amount of time<br>a limited amount of energy<br>what do we actually want to prioritize<br>and that's truly up to us<br>we hold all of the power and that's<br>something that we can forget<br>is that actually in these crises that<br>we're up against the climate crisis<br>the youth mental health crisis as a<br>society we actually hold<br>all control so so what what really is<br>stopping us in terms of youth being<br>involved in these conversations and<br>for them to really happen<br>intergenerationally we need to trust<br>that young people have solutions that<br>young people have<br>valid and valuable knowledge and<br>understanding to bring to these tables<br>and we also need to learn<br>i think how to better pass the mic and<br>how to better<br>create and seed opportunities for people<br>who<br>who might not have the same perspectives<br>as us<br>but knowing that that'll in turn help<br>the end goal<br>and the outcome in the end we need to<br>invite people to the table we need to<br>bring people into the movement we need<br>to<br>truly think of this as our collective<br>home and not just a home of one<br>generation<br>not just a home of one race not just a<br>home<br>of one specific demographic but actually<br>we all<br>are sharing the space like we are right<br>now we're sharing sharing the space<br>to scale up we need to focus on the why<br>because you can believe in the why and<br>if we want to bring people in<br>and be able to scale up our collective<br>effort and momentum<br>then people need to understand why and<br>what they're getting<br>to be a part of and the vision and the<br>dream needs to be solved and that's why<br>i think<br>gerald's incredible well-being garden is<br>a great first step to that because you<br>can see it<br>so often we talk about well-being we<br>talk about uplifting people's money we<br>talk about<br>enabling we talk about empowering people<br>what does it look like<br>and so i think we need to have that<br>dream<br>that vision that we can help to sell to<br>people<br>we need to step into our own individual<br>responsibilities as well<br>because i think that individual<br>responsibility<br>individual responsibility individual<br>action is all part of collective action<br>so if collectively we want to move<br>forwards we have to be<br>taking steps in our own kind of life<br>and within our own world view to make<br>sure that we are<br>able to see the world through a lens<br>that recognizes<br>the perspective and the<br>the vibrancy that every every person<br>brings to the conversation for the most<br>part though<br>i'm sure that many of us do know why we<br>do<br>what we do and i truly believe though<br>that to move forwards and to scale up<br>we do just have to strip things back a<br>little bit<br>we actually just need to go okay what<br>are we what are we not going to do<br>to be able to move move us forward<br>what processes actually aren't helping<br>us to achieve any of these<br>key indicators for wellbeing maybe<br>they're<br>you know causing detriment maybe they're<br>not but what are what aren't actually<br>assisting us<br>so for me thinking about how we move<br>forwards<br>and scale up i am only i only bring one<br>perspective<br>to this and i recognize too<br>that there are many people of many ages<br>who would have their own<br>kind of belief or understanding of what<br>moving forwards and scaling up even<br>looks like<br>but i think we need to like i said learn<br>how to better pass the mic and create<br>space for solutions that might be<br>different to ours<br>and whether that's you know better<br>understanding<br>how to do that um whether that's<br>better understanding how to enable<br>others whether that's understanding<br>how to focus and communicate our own why<br>whether that's figuring out what youth<br>movements are happening in your<br>community and going how do i support you<br>actually reaching out to them and asking<br>whether you can hear what they have to<br>say and how you can better support them<br>i think it's a journey for all of us and<br>to collectively and intergenerationally<br>move forward though we need to know<br>and hear from a variety of people within<br>what kind of ancestors do we want to be<br>there are massive conversations at the<br>moment<br>as garrow mentioned too the local<br>government reform the future of local<br>government<br>there's conversations about our<br>long-term plan about long-term plans<br>across many districts<br>in aotearoa and this is a question i'm<br>constantly asking myself<br>because i think if we're truly if we're<br>truly thinking intergenerationally<br>we have to think about the legacy that<br>we will be leaving to the generation<br>that inherits this planet from us<br>because<br>i sometimes get into this mindset of<br>going okay well i'm here right now<br>and i can make a difference and it'll be<br>great because then<br>when i bring people maybe into this<br>world then they will be able to enjoy<br>this planet that we've all created and<br>that vision that we've had and that<br>we've had the willpower to actually<br>create<br>but there's life beyond that hopefully<br>there's generations that will follow for<br>you know hopefully<br>hundreds thousands of years if we're<br>able to get the planet in shape before<br>then<br>but if in our own minds we believe that<br>things are possible<br>i believed i truly believed that the<br>school strike for climate movement could<br>be powerful and we've shown that we were<br>and that we will continue to be<br>i didn't know if i could get elected to<br>council but i knew i just had to try<br>and sometimes we just have to to try and<br>just to know why we're doing things and<br>to know the importance of it because we<br>don't have long to be a good ancestor<br>we only have a limited amount of time on<br>this planet and<br>if we truly want to to do what we can<br>now's really the only moment<br>so things things will be hard and<br>things are challenging but again i think<br>keeping it simple<br>and being able to stay grounded in our<br>why is<br>is one of the only ways that we're going<br>to move forwards because otherwise we<br>just keep on<br>adding to this this kind of dense<br>environment of information and<br>the anxiety that people already feel<br>about the current state of our world<br>without a vision to move forward i don't<br>think that's going to get us anywhere<br>so if we can all be a part of creating<br>that in some way shape or form<br>what that looks like i think is a<br>combination of you know indigenous<br>knowledge who have<br>people who have known how to live and<br>balance with the planet for many many<br>years<br>in conjunction with the voices of young<br>people who<br>who have this kind of i've found anyway<br>sitting alongside young people who<br>who think beyond constraints and that's<br>what we need to do that's the way we<br>need to be thinking<br>keeping it simple but allowing ourselves<br>to think beyond constraints<br>so i found that hard to answer and hard<br>to process in my own mind but hopefully<br>that's given you<br>some things to think about there's so<br>much that's possible we just have to<br>believe it<br>and we can truly be good ancestors if we<br>believe and understand the ways of doing<br>that and there are many<br>so i would just encourage you all to<br>step into the responsibility the<br>responsibility that we have to do that<br>and yeah kia kahan that journey and<br>support one another<br>and across generations i can tell you<br>that it's in our best interests as young<br>people and also in yours<br>for us to be a part of this journey<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
