congratulations<br>savor this special moment with your<br>friends and families and<br>be proud of yourself<br>you know it's a real privilege for me<br>today to be giving this speech to you<br>and it's a wonderful thing that we can<br>actually meet together<br>in the midst of a global pandemic<br>and i must say that the covert 19<br>pandemic has influenced what i'd like to<br>in the middle of 2019 i had a phone call<br>from my dean<br>asking me to take over the task of<br>chairing the university's pandemic<br>planning group<br>this will be two short meetings a year<br>focused on ticking a few boxes<br>even you can do it philip he said of<br>course none of us had any inkling<br>of what was to come over the next months<br>at one point last year i almost hit a<br>wall many weeks of interactions<br>every day around covert 19 in my role<br>absorption into a ministry of health<br>process that became complicated<br>and having to engage the media<br>i found myself craving space and time<br>out<br>after wondering whether this was a sign<br>of weakness<br>i came to realize that the very best<br>leaders<br>always find time for reflection<br>this is why today i want to encourage<br>you<br>to stop and think if you're going to<br>succeed<br>you need to develop the ability to stop<br>and think<br>sir isaac newton said if others would<br>think as hard as i did<br>then they would get similar results when<br>asked how he discovered the law of<br>gravity he replied<br>time and again it's been demonstrated<br>that you don't need to be a genius<br>to make a difference in the world also<br>many of the greatest<br>achievements have had nothing to do with<br>money<br>being smart and rich can actually get in<br>in 2001 i secured a job at the british<br>medical research council research unit<br>in the gambia in west africa<br>this unit which employs around 700 staff<br>has been conducting world leading<br>research mainly into infectious diseases<br>for the past 75 years<br>soon after i started at mrc i went over<br>to the labs<br>and met an immunologist<br>roger brooks had been sent out from<br>oxford to set up the immunological<br>assays<br>for the trials of the first new tb<br>vaccine to be evaluated in human since<br>1921.<br>he was sitting at his desk and was<br>pleased to meet me<br>as we finished chatting i asked him<br>roger<br>what's that graph on your computer<br>screen<br>he proudly took me through a bar chart<br>showing<br>ali spot readout from 10 household<br>contacts<br>of a person with tb disease and<br>proceeded to pronounce each of these<br>as infected or not infected as he moved<br>along the graph<br>i said roger how do you know if they're<br>infected or not<br>he explained that each spot on his ali<br>spot assay<br>signaled interferon gamma released from<br>a single t cell<br>in response to stimulation with two<br>highly specific<br>tb antigens he said if spots<br>clearly appeared then the person was<br>certainly infected<br>i found this fascinating but i explained<br>to roger<br>that i thought we could apply some<br>epidemiological tools<br>to really prove that this test was the<br>real deal<br>before long roger and i were regularly<br>meeting around the table<br>just talking epidemiology and immunology<br>to each other<br>we came up with a new way to evaluate a<br>test for tb<br>infection of those with no symptoms of<br>disease using what we called a<br>reproducible gradient of exposure<br>we used basic integrated thinking about<br>the properties<br>of the pathogen and the properties of<br>the test<br>to come up with a hypothesis that a<br>positive test wouldn't actually last<br>very long<br>and designed a cohort study to test and<br>prove our hypothesis<br>we discovered that 40 of those who were<br>positive when we first met them<br>had a negative test three months later<br>and we came up with many other studies<br>trying to link observation<br>with mechanism and with our<br>collaborators we published a whole raft<br>of articles in many of the world's top<br>journals roger and i practiced stopping<br>and thinking<br>every friday afternoon we never actually<br>scheduled the time<br>we just both appeared around the table<br>and because we knew so little about each<br>other's specialist area<br>it was just fine to ask the most stupid<br>of questions<br>without any sense of embarrassment<br>one thing that i learned at the mrc unit<br>in the gambia<br>is that integrated thinking which i<br>define as thinking that bridges<br>different disciplines is crucial<br>to solving many of the challenges that<br>we face in the world today<br>but here's the problem such integrated<br>thinking<br>is actually more rare than it has ever<br>been<br>this is at least partly because we've<br>become so specialized<br>that we don't know how to talk to each<br>other<br>while at the same time people are<br>stopping to think<br>less than they ever have we can't talk<br>to each other about complex problems<br>and we don't make time to talk to each<br>other<br>this toxic combination has led to a very<br>dangerous<br>situation in the world today we are in<br>desperate need of some things that we<br>are not stopping to think about<br>you can see how this is played out in<br>covert 19 disasters across the world<br>even in country with some of the world's<br>most celebrated super specialists<br>providing advice<br>covert 19 has exposed an inability of<br>many specialist experts<br>to stop and conduct basic integrated<br>thinking<br>in the presence of a challenge of any<br>level of complexity<br>and their inability to overcome their<br>own preconceptions<br>covert 19 has exposed how bad things<br>have got with our selection of leaders<br>it has exposed the willingness of some<br>people to peel their own agenda<br>and misrepresent the truth even at the<br>potential cost of thousands if not<br>millions of lives<br>we in the health field have a sober<br>responsibility<br>always to put the health of the patient<br>and the health of the population first<br>even if it costs us personally<br>and covert 19 has exposed at least in<br>some countries a lack of concern for the<br>most vulnerable in the population<br>and we in new zealand have demonstrated<br>a lack of concern for those in other<br>countries<br>who are worse off than ourselves<br>so why are these things relevant to you<br>as you go from here<br>showing on social media that you<br>graduated today<br>looking smart beautiful and happy<br>these are all fine but i want to<br>encourage you to commit<br>to being a person who stops and thinks<br>you can start right now stop and think<br>how privileged we are to be here today<br>stop and think how special it is to have<br>your supporters watching on<br>those people who only ever want you to<br>go well<br>stop and think about the history of<br>these great dunedin buildings the<br>intentions of those who settled here<br>and how they're still reflected in the<br>city and the university today<br>stop and think about who you need to<br>forgive<br>who you need to stand up against who you<br>don't need to be bothered about<br>what you should stop and what you should<br>begin<br>but most of all learn to find the time<br>in your life to stop and think as a<br>habit<br>many people say i can't afford to take<br>time to stop and think<br>the obvious response to that is you<br>can't afford not to<br>for the sake of yourself but also for<br>the sake of those you care for and those<br>you will lead<br>in the future the world needs people who<br>can fix<br>things that other people say can't be<br>fixed<br>who can change things that other people<br>say can't be changed<br>may you go out from here knowing always<br>that you have something to offer<br>katoa<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
