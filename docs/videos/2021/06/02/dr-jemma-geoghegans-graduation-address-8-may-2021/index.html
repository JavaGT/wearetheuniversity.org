families<br>and friends<br>and to you for most people their final<br>year at university<br>is the most challenging one but for you<br>well it was the year that the world<br>stood still and it will be remembered in<br>history<br>as the year of covet 19. you have<br>graduated during unprecedented global<br>pandemic<br>it was caused by a virus that jumped<br>from wildlife into humans and<br>quickly swept the world it caused the<br>world to lock down<br>it led to health care systems being<br>overrun and it has caused devastatingly<br>high rates of mortality and morbidity<br>but in new zealand we took a different<br>path we were told to stay home to save<br>lives and that's what we did<br>and in doing so has meant that we can be<br>here today to celebrate together<br>we can be here in 3d when most of the<br>rest of the world<br>faces record numbers of reported cases<br>and deaths and even<br>more inevitable lockdowns so let us<br>focus on what can become of our<br>experiences<br>through this extraordinary year in<br>history let us focus<br>or try hard to find the silver linings<br>i too am part of a cohort that graduated<br>during a notable year in history<br>that was a global financial crisis but<br>that seems a bit insignificant in<br>comparison<br>but nevertheless the post um university<br>paths were somewhat uncertain back then<br>and for me while well navigating the<br>unknown<br>i had absolutely no idea what i wanted<br>to do as a fresh young graduate<br>i was eager for adventure so i decided<br>to leave my home small small home town<br>in scotland<br>and move to the furthest away place<br>possible dunedin<br>i also decided it was going to be much<br>easier to stay at university rather than<br>leave and base<br>reality so i undertook a phd here at<br>otago<br>i often think back to that time that in<br>circumstances were different<br>easier perhaps maybe i wouldn't have had<br>a strong desire to escape and i wouldn't<br>have come to this extraordinary place on<br>earth and i call home<br>and i wouldn't have met my kiwi husband<br>or had our kiwi daughter<br>and i wouldn't have met those lifelong<br>friendships that um<br>while flatting as a student when it was<br>colder inside than out and i wouldn't<br>have had that vital mentorship that i<br>experienced here at otago<br>i wouldn't have gained the<br>qualifications that allowed me to take<br>up research positions around the world<br>first in new york and then in australia<br>working with world-class researchers at<br>the forefront of my field<br>and i wouldn't have gained those<br>invaluable experiences that would<br>eventually allow me to find a path to<br>come back here<br>to the university of otago and i'm<br>really just at the beginning of my<br>research journey<br>my research interest lies in<br>understanding how viruses evolve<br>viruses are perhaps the best examples of<br>evolution by natural selection<br>where their evolutionary processes can<br>often be so rapid<br>they can be seen in real time darwin<br>would have loved viruses<br>i study virus evolution on both the<br>macro evolutionary scale<br>where viruses in their hosts have<br>co-evolved for hundreds of millions of<br>years<br>and at the microevolutionary scale where<br>a seemingly novel virus<br>jumps a species barrier and emerges in a<br>new host and how it might then<br>evolve where it spreads in populations<br>through space and time<br>so in late 2019 when we were making<br>plans to move back to otago<br>i had a fleeting moment of panic about<br>what i should work on next<br>little did i know about the next few<br>years we're all about to experience<br>looking at the pandemic through a lens<br>of an evolutionary biologist allowed me<br>and my colleagues<br>to see the value in sequencing the<br>genomes of the virus to better inform<br>our response to coven 19.<br>i think it's fair to say that genome<br>genomics has played a starring role in<br>new zealand's response<br>and everyone in new zealand knows now<br>knows the term genomic sequencing<br>but when i was sitting where you are now<br>i can tell you i didn't have a clue<br>what i was going to do i didn't know<br>that i would be working at the forefront<br>of the response to a global pandemic<br>but i could see where i could have some<br>value this year<br>we will remember the lockdowns the<br>disruption the fear<br>and the sickness but if we search for<br>those silver linings<br>most of all there is an incredible<br>transformation in the enthusiasm for<br>science<br>we are just 16 months into the worst<br>global pandemic in 100 years<br>but science has enabled over a million<br>coronavirus genomes to be sequenced and<br>shared to track new variants in real<br>time<br>science has informed the development of<br>cutting-edge vaccine technologies and<br>science has aided mathematical models<br>to understand the viruses trajectory<br>that informed our elimination strategy<br>in the first place<br>in short and i hate to quote matt damon<br>some 20 years from now when you're<br>running your world-class scientific<br>research institutes or you're the ceos<br>of the world leading companies<br>you will tell your students and your<br>employees how you graduated during the<br>pandemic<br>and the resilience that you learned from<br>this experience<br>is a secret to your success you've shown<br>how to overcome uncertainty<br>and because of this you'll be a better<br>scientist than those who have come<br>before<br>the pandemic has changed the world but<br>you who graduated during this time in<br>history<br>are the ones who are best equipped to<br>lead us into this change<br>you have the opportunity to lead us into<br>the new post-pandemic age<br>so as variants and vaccines dominate our<br>lives this year<br>i urge you to use your education and see<br>where you can add some value<br>you don't have to know yet what you will<br>do or where you will do it or how you<br>will do it<br>just know that as you navigate this<br>uncertain time<br>opportunities exist for you that you<br>probably don't even know about yet<br>but you can seek them out and you can<br>remake this world congratulations and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
