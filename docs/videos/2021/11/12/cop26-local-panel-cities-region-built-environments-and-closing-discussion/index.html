am<br>facilitating this session<br>representing<br>the commonwealth human ecology council i<br>shall call it czech<br>and the people at czech who are<br>presently at cop in glasgow<br>reporting to you every day<br>very delighted to meet the speakers this<br>morning<br>and i'd like to say<br>kia ora and<br>welcome<br>uh everybody and i'll just<br>make a few general points then about<br>cities before we start<br>adaptation<br>to climate change<br>is particularly linked to urban poverty<br>because the urban poor are the most<br>vulnerable to climate change in many<br>things<br>they live very often in situations that<br>are more<br>risky<br>um either on the water's edge on flood<br>plains or perhaps in areas that are<br>likely to be affected by landslides that<br>says set off by heavy rains<br>in planning and improving and adapting<br>cities<br>we need<br>to<br>consider<br>how<br>human health and well-being cannot be<br>separated from the impacts of climate<br>change<br>we have to note<br>that many urban communities<br>in many countries<br>have been able to develop their own<br>strategies for dealing with the impacts<br>of climate change because governments<br>have failed to assist them<br>and what we need<br>is integrated thinking<br>the interlinking of environmental and<br>social polities<br>the integration of action and attention<br>to the delete deep detailed delivery of<br>actions particularly in areas where you<br>have<br>differing local social situations<br>differing<br>abilities to<br>move around and respond to<br>things we need to think carefully and<br>that<br>leads us to the idea that<br>we<br>have to<br>combine<br>what we might call top-down approaches<br>from central governments and regional<br>governments and bottom-up approaches<br>from communities<br>and we have to integrate the<br>activities<br>of<br>uh<br>everybody from individuals and i can't<br>over emphasize individual responsibility<br>our founder of the human ecology council<br>was very strong and that ngos local<br>communities<br>local governments private enterprises<br>regional governments and national<br>governments<br>and<br>this<br>is where we<br>all these complex<br>factors<br>um we therefore<br>need<br>in these discussions<br>to think<br>how<br>we blend<br>our local knowledge<br>with the assistance that comes from<br>higher levels and we're very fortunate<br>in having people who represent<br>the national government<br>the local communities local<br>organizations and community groups this<br>evening<br>could i now please<br>invite<br>dr<br>gaurav<br>to<br>make his presentation<br>uh i expect most people know<br>that<br>dr sharma is the mp for hamilton west<br>and i'm very glad dr sharma to have you<br>here this evening<br>we're glad to hear you<br>sure and thank you ian<br>um<br>everyone my name is gaurav sham i'm the<br>member of parliament for hamilton west<br>electorate in new zealand<br>and what i was just saying before was i<br>was just doing a big tip<br>which is basically a a maori tradition<br>uh where we talk about our uh<br>inheritance you know we talk about our<br>heritage uh where we come from i guess<br>uh because that kind of decides and<br>gives you an example of where we are<br>heading and i think a lot of the<br>conversation today about climate change<br>is focused around that<br>before we can talk about you know what<br>it is that we can do around climate<br>change we need to know uh what it is<br>that we have already done and what it is<br>that we actually haven't been able to do<br>so as far as uh you know the new zone<br>government is concerned i'm incredibly<br>proud<br>to be part of<br>a government that has you know taken<br>climate change very seriously uh and in<br>the last four years uh the labor<br>government has done uh you know more<br>than any of the other governments have<br>been able to do uh in this sector and a<br>lot of it is obviously<br>been born out of necessity uh because of<br>the times we live in you know the the<br>climate crisis is nearing it is already<br>here<br>and we need to act on it<br>i just wanted to quickly share some of<br>the things that the government has been<br>able to do<br>in the last four years leading up to the<br>the cop 26 summit<br>um so starting with uh when we came into<br>government four years ago we ended new<br>offshore oil and gas exploration<br>uh we passed the zero carbon act and<br>became one of the first countries to put<br>the one and a half degree<br>celsius global warming threshold into<br>our primary legislation<br>we established the climate change<br>commission<br>and we've now got our<br>pre-emissions budgets lined up<br>uh we've overhauled the emission trading<br>scheme and put a lid on emissions for<br>the first time uh we actually started<br>planting a billion trees uh and invested<br>1.2 billion dollars uh in what's called<br>jobs for nature program so that is<br>around um creating jobs which are<br>helping look after our environment<br>uh we invested a billion dollars<br>into buses trains cycling and walking uh<br>infrastructure here in hamilton we've<br>just invented invested 90 million<br>dollars to restart a train which hasn't<br>existed for uh many decades and it just<br>means we've got a new way of<br>transporting people between our biggest<br>city auckland uh and hamilton uh where<br>i'm from<br>uh we're investing in<br>ev charging infrastructure around the<br>economy<br>we've started to replace the entire<br>entire government fleet<br>with our zero emission vehicles<br>we brought in vehicle emission standards<br>for new imports for the first time in<br>new zealand<br>we brought back the mandate to include<br>biofuels in the petrol uh which we'll<br>still be using uh until everybody you<br>know transitions to uh<br>an electric fleet<br>uh we're instead of a new energy<br>research center in taranaki uh which is<br>part of new zealand uh to kick start the<br>hydrogen economy uh we're helping<br>businesses to switch to clean energy<br>with government investment in the<br>carbonizing industry fund uh we're<br>starting to replace our own core boilers<br>in schools and hospitals and<br>universities with clean alternatives<br>we've started the building for climate<br>change program<br>to cut emissions from building and<br>construction and i'll come back to it in<br>a bit<br>we've invested in warmer tv homes we've<br>doubled climate change<br>related aid to pacific countries<br>we declared a climate emergency and<br>committed the public service to carbon<br>neutrality by 2025.<br>we also became the first country in the<br>world to legislate for a price on<br>agriculture emissions<br>and we're currently building the world's<br>only farm level of mission measurements<br>management and pricing system<br>we introduce<br>a legislation to require all listed<br>companies in large financial<br>institutions to report on their<br>climate-related risks um so a lot of<br>things have been done leading up to this<br>cop 26<br>summit but i uh but i think there's a<br>lot more that can be done and you know<br>when especially talking about building a<br>construction seat<br>uh one of the things you were talking<br>about ian was that you know everything<br>is interlinked<br>uh in my previous life uh before i<br>became a member of parliament i was a<br>medical doctor in the community<br>uh and and you know i just saw how<br>housing can affect people's health in<br>causing asthma you know how bad<br>transportation uh can affect people's<br>health in different ways so so the<br>building sector is not any different<br>from any other sector we need to make<br>sure you know there is good public<br>transport uh we need to make sure that<br>there are packs available for people to<br>exercise we need to make sure that the<br>construction<br>industry itself uh is in utilizing<br>materials that's you know adding more uh<br>to the carbon emissions uh but it is a<br>very interconnected system<br>and i think the part of the problem has<br>been that uh often the policies have<br>been very patchwork uh people in<br>governments often focus on one side and<br>then forget the the completely different<br>part of uh the interconnected system<br>um but things are changing and one of<br>the you know practical examples i wanted<br>to give you was uh of uh scion which is<br>a research institute uh in uh in new<br>zealand in rotorua<br>and what they've done is uh for around<br>local climate change issues they've<br>developed a new this beautiful<br>three-story building uh it's got a<br>double skin facade which provides heat<br>recovery in winter uh with its colored<br>glazing panels<br>and then this internal building cavity<br>which regulates thermal gains during<br>summer time<br>and then they've got you know natural<br>ventilation they've got solar shedding<br>they've got led lighting<br>all sorts of things that are involved in<br>reducing the ongoing and running costs<br>but also in terms of helping<br>you know with their sort of uh climate<br>change impact<br>uh most of the building is actually<br>constructed with wood<br>uh and even though you know the building<br>wasn't designed to be negative using<br>wood instead of the alternative<br>construction materials have meant that<br>you know they've been able to reduce the<br>uh greenhouse gas emissions and fossil<br>fuel uh consumption during the<br>production uh and building of this uh of<br>this beautiful building uh and what<br>we've learned from that is you know like<br>you can have a really beautiful<br>architectural building but you can also<br>do it in a more sustainable way<br>and in a way that it's not just that<br>one-off construction but also the<br>maintenance of the building<br>and similarly um new zealand parliament<br>is now looking at building a new annex<br>and and they've all gone actually to the<br>science building in rotorua to learn<br>from what they've been able to do<br>in this fair<br>um so i guess as far as um you know the<br>um<br>uh the the challenges ahead are<br>concerned you know there's a lot that is<br>being done but uh but i do abolish that<br>there is more to be done and we're just<br>in the first steps um and time is<br>running out uh you know our commitment<br>towards 2015 and 2030 uh it's not too<br>far down the road with 2022 almost so<br>uh eight to nine years before uh we're<br>gonna be<br>uh you know judged on our impact uh as<br>well um but that's all i've got to say<br>for now and if there's any questions i<br>can take it towards the end of this<br>session thank you so much<br>it's<br>nice to have confirmation<br>that<br>as usual new zealand is leading the<br>world by a good example<br>i hope you can get the building<br>regulations<br>to<br>insist that all new buildings<br>have<br>their own power generation from solar<br>panels and they have proper insulation<br>to cut down energy<br>consumption and so on it's amazing that<br>we don't keep abreast of the technology<br>availability to improve building<br>regulations but thank you very much for<br>the moment<br>can i now please uh move on to<br>rupert kiara rupert<br>i<br>understand that<br>you're a man<br>with similar interests to mine<br>my children remind me that when they<br>were young i would go out into the<br>countryside for a trip and i'd always be<br>stopping to fill bottles of up with<br>dirty water to find out what what was<br>being carried down the streams and i<br>think your your work you are very<br>practical environmentalist<br>solving problems keeping us healthy<br>we're looking forward to hearing what<br>i'm a principal scientist at<br>another crown research institute in new<br>zealand called niwa national institute<br>of water and atmospheric research<br>and i work in the aquatic pollution<br>mitigation group which is based here in<br>hamilton and i work with a very talented<br>group of scientists<br>in the in the freshwater and estuary<br>centre specifically looking at the<br>causes and effects of water quality<br>degradation and much of our work is is<br>relevant for cities in the in the built<br>environment we have projects looking at<br>urban storm water<br>and and specifically heavy metal<br>leeching off of roofs and toxicity to<br>aquatic life<br>um and of course with climate change and<br>increased rainfall in places that will<br>be exacerbated um we're looking at uh<br>demonstrating<br>um i guess techniques for for measuring<br>water quality in in real time most of<br>our water quality measurements at the<br>moment are just grab samples that happen<br>maybe once a week or if we're lucky um<br>you know hourly<br>but to have these in in-stream<br>real-time technologies that will tell<br>you as as water quality varies on a<br>minute-by-minute basis is is really<br>really going to revolutionize the way we<br>can<br>look at the world and and how we can um<br>mitigate some of the problems that that<br>are happening and that's relevant not<br>only for protecting aquatic life but<br>also for recreation in terms of how<br>swimmable our our waters are again if we<br>have big flood flows that<br>generally brings in a lot of<br>contamination and if we can know that uh<br>in real time that will be helpful<br>we have a specific project here in<br>hamilton at the uh manga called tukutuku<br>it's an urban research<br>hub which is looking at the peacocks<br>it's an urban new urban development<br>which is going from ring fields<br>through to<br>new new housing development and we're<br>monitoring the impact of those streams<br>as that urbanization uh<br>takes effect and how we can minimize the<br>um the the impact on the both the<br>organisms that live in those streams and<br>also the quality of that of that water<br>and alongside that we have um new models<br>that are being developed that will<br>enable us to predict<br>the water quality uh<br>under various scenarios of of<br>urbanization and and particularly how<br>climate impacts are going to have an<br>effect on that<br>and overarching a lot of our work we<br>have these um larger sort of<br>pollutant load models that enable us to<br>assess<br>and predict<br>what climate change may do and different<br>changes in land use will have as<br>consequences to our rivers in estuaries<br>just turning more to my<br>particular focus<br>in research is really looking at<br>treatment of wastewaters<br>and<br>we have a program that is looking to<br>develop more efficient and<br>cost-effective and<br>but but natural green technologies to<br>solve some of our pollution um issues<br>that are uh coming out of our cities<br>and uh we work with with industry<br>stakeholders but particularly um maori<br>partners across new zealand and uh a<br>central part of this project is actually<br>to<br>integrate maori knowledge matarona mori<br>uh with our cutting-edge scientific<br>innovations and i think um<br>you know<br>we can learn a lot from the far more<br>holistic worldview that that maori have<br>um and by integrating that with our<br>science and there's there's a couple of<br>points i pick up on that there's one the<br>uh um the role that maori have as<br>kaitiaki tanga<br>as custodians and guardians of the<br>environment um<br>secondly the the the maori worldview the<br>tamannaah to why<br>the uh the interconnectedness of<br>everything so that the health of our<br>waters<br>is<br>highly relevant to the health of our<br>environment and then the health of us<br>as people and uh it's it's wonderful<br>that that um<br>philosophy is being uh embraced by our<br>government policies and essential fresh<br>water<br>um and then finally just the<br>intergenerational view that maori have<br>of the you know of the consequences of<br>things we do today and not just<br>how we look at it in two to three years<br>time it's how we're going to affect<br>things for our next generation so<br>leaving a legacy and all of those are so<br>important<br>in this at this time of of great change<br>so a major climate change issue for many<br>of our towns and cities<br>are<br>greenhouse gas emissions and a lot of<br>the greenhouse gas emissions<br>um<br>from towns and cities the main ones<br>could well be from their wastewater<br>treatment plants so<br>it's a highly relevant issue to to look<br>at ways in which we can minimize<br>emissions<br>um a lot of those come from methane and<br>nitrous oxide and interestingly at the<br>uh the copper 26 summit<br>there's now<br>a climate change agreement to reduce<br>global retain emissions by 30 by 2030<br>which is a big step up from the current<br>10 by 2030 so this will require<br>you know<br>international and nationally led<br>approaches um<br>partnerships to address how we might<br>mitigate and adapt to some of these<br>climate change um challenges across the<br>whole wastewater sector and i think<br>although i'm going to talk about the<br>wastewater sector this this you know<br>obviously would um<br>um transpose to every other sector uh to<br>do with our urban environments um we we<br>have some pretty large knowledge gaps<br>um around emission data for wasteful<br>treatment processes that we need to sort<br>out um we need to identify much better<br>control measures and develop new<br>technologies<br>which is going to require more<br>investment in research but also training<br>and and particularly education education<br>of our public of our communities<br>of of uh where did where do things go<br>when you flush what are the consequences<br>of putting this um down your toilet um<br>and and how does that affect um the the<br>health and the quality of water in our<br>streams and rivers<br>um but in many cases we do have<br>uh knowledge and we do have tools to<br>start addressing some of these issues<br>today<br>and uh picking up on one of the ends<br>points again is that it's our individual<br>responsibility to start to take action<br>all of us are involved in this this is a<br>global situation and we can all do our<br>part<br>and hopefully uh we'll get to a point<br>where we can transition to an energy and<br>climate neutral<br>cities and and particularly wastewater<br>and we may well be able to transform our<br>wastewater treatment plants<br>into resource recovery centers where we<br>recycle carbon nitrogen and water um for<br>thank you<br>thank you very much rupert that's a<br>brilliant suggestion to end on the way<br>we actually make the wastewater plant a<br>key element of the circular economy<br>which is increasingly necessary to have<br>in our minds when we make all these<br>plans to adapt for to climate change<br>thanks very much and now i think we're<br>who i believe you have<br>had some interesting<br>problems<br>of<br>environmental damage<br>coping with the<br>difficulties caused by natural processes<br>hitting<br>urban areas and<br>you've had to make some<br>strong<br>community action to<br>set things in<br>on a better path i look forward to<br>hearing and i'm sure we all do hearing<br>what you say here aura<br>traditional village in the heart of our<br>so from making two on the coast uh to<br>almost to stretching to<br>mount uh<br>we're five minutes<br>from brutal central city here in our par<br>we have three marae and we're boarded by<br>the utah stream and lake rotorua<br>and i will go<br>i will go into a few of the<br>issues we've<br>dealt with<br>that they were raised earlier i just um<br>i'm terrible climate change<br>coordinator um at tower lakes trust<br>and<br>i'm also a member of the tower of<br>climate change working group<br>who under the umbrella of the tarot<br>lakes trust partnered with scion and<br>developed taraki kulpu the town of<br>climate change strategy um<br>which we launched on october 1st and<br>before i<br>share um<br>some quoted about the style of living in<br>land use desired by the eu i thought i'd<br>just give you a little bit of background<br>um about the strategy<br>so um channel lakes trust our post<br>treaty of waitangi settlement entity are<br>responsible for the management of 14 of<br>the 17 chanwa lakes in our district<br>in 2018 um<br>tara experienced flooding at little<br>waihee on the coast a tree went through<br>the dining room roof at one of our marae<br>during a storm event<br>taha stream flooded<br>the local community there and coastal<br>erosion caused a landslide scattering<br>koi or the remains of ngati fukui<br>ancestors onto the beach at makitu<br>these all happened um in 2018 and at the<br>teleworld lakes trust agm<br>that year<br>um a lot of the whanau<br>raised the issue of climate change and<br>said who's talking about it you know<br>the climate change is here but here we<br>are really starting to feel the impacts<br>um what we're going to do about it<br>um telematics trust<br>as i said are responsible for the<br>management of our lakes<br>they said<br>they responded by saying yes you know we<br>we're watching the climate change<br>impacts on the lakes um with<br>for example um<br>warming water levels and the impacts on<br>tonga species<br>but<br>in terms of the wider impacts on the ewe<br>um<br>we are happy to facilitate a hui um for<br>anybody who's interested so tara alex<br>just did that<br>and just<br>opened um the hui for anyone who was had<br>any type of interest in climate change<br>from that the tarot climate change<br>working group was formed<br>and we partnered with scion<br>and teleworld lakes trust<br>too as i said put together the strategy<br>to research and put together the<br>strategy<br>from that six priority areas were<br>highlighted by our whanau and hapu these<br>were food and water security and<br>sovereignty energy security and<br>sovereignty biodiversity land use change<br>in practices circular enterprise and<br>economies and the last one adaptation<br>planning and resilience building which<br>also includes our cultural<br>infrastructure such as our power our<br>marae urupa our burial grounds<br>because the impacts of climate change on<br>these effects our identity our culture<br>our everyday lives<br>so that's just a little bit of<br>background on the strategy<br>from our conversations we were able to<br>put together a vision<br>um of teruah whanau and hapu in this<br>time of climate change and i'd just like<br>to share that with you now our rivers<br>and lakes are clean we can drink from<br>them swim in them water our gardens from<br>them and our families can once again<br>supplement our meals and show<br>manakitanga to our manuhiti by providing<br>fresh water clean water on tables that<br>are marae<br>our tourist food basket where our fresh<br>water meets timon and nuyakiwa the<br>pacific ocean at makitu and little<br>waihee is restored and protected through<br>appropriate land use within catchment<br>growing harvesting and eating our own<br>nutritious kay is a normal part of our<br>children's lives we eat fruit from trees<br>growing on front lawns like we used to<br>harvest vegetables from home and<br>community gardens to supplement our<br>family meals our whanau and communities<br>eat predominantly locally grown food<br>and our food systems allow the easy<br>sharing of craig amongst ourselves with<br>other hapu and diwi and between other<br>communities across all taoroa<br>our wetlands and indigenous rainforests<br>are rebuilt<br>our lands forests and waterways are pest<br>free our indigenous ecosystems are<br>thriving and our tolerance species<br>flourishing<br>the connections between our communities<br>and our natural environment are<br>re-established<br>we live amongst restored natural<br>landscapes in our villages towns suburbs<br>and city we grow and gather our own dona<br>medicine and actively spend time in<br>nature as part of everyday living<br>whether for relaxation fun exercise<br>healing learning or while performing<br>green jobs as part of an established<br>green economy<br>all land use is determined with the<br>health and well-being of our soils<br>waterways and indigenous ecosystems<br>prioritized<br>in areas with access to geothermal our<br>whanau and communities use our lafa<br>lgsm to heat our homes cook our food and<br>bathing<br>every rooftop has solar panels and we<br>share power with our neighbours and<br>across our communities based on need<br>our harbour and ewe utilizes the wind<br>water and sun across our lands to<br>produce extra power for our marae and<br>other collective usage<br>our whanau including those displaced by<br>climate change live in healthy homes on<br>our papakainga lands<br>lotsura city and suburbs are supported<br>by green biophilic water sensitive<br>infrastructure and have been reshaped to<br>support carlos communities with easy<br>access to all necessary services and<br>amenities such as schools shops<br>playgrounds and green spaces<br>other places of significance such as<br>waihikapu and cultural heritage sites<br>are recognized and respected<br>our people work for our own early owned<br>and operated businesses making up food<br>and resource circular economies at muda<br>and community level<br>there is no waste in our environment we<br>reduce reuse repair rebuild refurbish<br>resell recycle and compost everywhere we<br>learn<br>live work gather and play<br>our families understand the changes that<br>climate change may bring they're<br>emotionally and spiritually prepared for<br>change<br>our communities are safe from rising<br>rivers lakes seas and the changing<br>weather<br>they are resilient adaptive ready to<br>work together to mitigate any impacts<br>and are prepared with emergency<br>management strategies and appropriate<br>resources this is the future vision of<br>in the words of<br>our climate range working group convener<br>nikki douglas<br>what we need now is for government and<br>the climate change commission to reflect<br>the interests of power enable<br>participation of hubble in theory in the<br>co-design and co-delivery of initiatives<br>and a commitment to investments and<br>initiatives led by hapuni we<br>are ready we'll focus outcomes focused<br>and<br>the ideal partner<br>thank you<br>thank you so much that's a beautiful<br>example of community<br>resilience and recovery<br>and response to<br>some pretty disastrous events and and<br>the really<br>positive<br>there are ways that can<br>uh allow us to deal with<br>the future hazards<br>and as well as doing that<br>we know how to<br>live a lifestyle that does not<br>add to the problems we already have in<br>the environment thank you so much for<br>that<br>now<br>sorry excuse me<br>jamie<br>toko if you would be so kind as to<br>tell us about uh what you have been<br>doing<br>um<br>professor<br>so my background is<br>this community<br>for<br>my interest is obviously with the<br>environment<br>and how we can prevent uh destruction of<br>our land<br>uh further prevent destruction of our<br>land so<br>from a commun community perspective<br>um<br>low socioeconomic communities<br>through the climate uh demise uh the<br>environmental demise is very minimal in<br>my opinion um and that will be because<br>um<br>low income to next to no income earners<br>um<br>don't contribute to the environment in<br>such a way as if they<br>were a lot more wealthy<br>although very low income to know and<br>communists we can be assured that the<br>environment will<br>still feature on their list of what<br>matters to them the most<br>and um there's something that we've seen<br>over the years uh they<br>they're happy to have a kai and as long<br>as they've got a roof over their head<br>and they've got a clean drinking water<br>um also from a maori perspective being<br>in the modern women's wealthy league for<br>many years now<br>um<br>the environment the environment has<br>always been is that leilani said it's a<br>um<br>so the environment has always been an<br>important component of how we live our<br>lives<br>um<br>as i appreciate what<br>what can be done for climate change<br>dr gurav<br>in new zealand by this government it<br>still falls short of the very simplest<br>solutions that can be<br>rectified on a daily basis now i'm<br>talking about the likes of<br>fonterra and farming<br>and just those guesses and<br>the unrecyclable<br>products that these<br>those type of organizations big<br>businesses use so we struggle to<br>comprehend that major players that<br>produce unrecyclable products<br>by the millions<br>continue to do so<br>until we can see some progress in these<br>areas we will continue to have<br>devastating impacts on our environment<br>applause in<br>the innovative parikuri initiative<br>community groups that tirelessly push<br>environmental issues<br>but they can only go as far as their<br>putia goes uh<br>how much funding they get<br>to<br>do to um<br>sees rivers and forests and it's so<br>beautiful to hear that we can swim in<br>our rivers downtown<br>and<br>where<br>some places in new zealand we can't do<br>that<br>this is instilled in us by our tupuna<br>and passed down to our grandchildren<br>we do our fair share of environmental<br>policing<br>to such a degree that building our own<br>infrastructure using our own land and<br>resources<br>is an integral position that we know<br>will work and be beneficial for our<br>whanau for the future<br>um and just in closing on there called<br>it all uh it is up to us<br>but unfortunately not everyone is on the<br>same walker<br>we ask that we remain resilient<br>and strong to do everything we can<br>to prevent further deprivation and<br>thank you so much<br>it's very<br>good to hear<br>how<br>your communities are<br>really trying to<br>live with their traditional concerns for<br>the environment but coping with all the<br>stresses that the modern world<br>imposes<br>on our on individuals on people on<br>families and of course on the<br>environment i<br>think there<br>is a tremendous<br>need to<br>really<br>cut the rate of consumption<br>we've seen<br>some figures<br>very recently<br>of how<br>all these billionaires like<br>the head<br>of<br>facebook amazon and so on how they spend<br>in<br>more<br>carbon emissions<br>than<br>the poorer parts of the city and i think<br>this differential<br>needs to<br>change as well it's part of the social<br>reform that has to sometime come in we<br>can't have<br>so many people<br>so few people very wealthy people<br>responsible for so much environmental<br>damage<br>now i'd like to turn to<br>victory<br>young<br>and ask you to talk about some of the<br>excellent work i understand you've been<br>doing<br>on the council and<br>i'm very<br>glad to be here today thank you so much<br>for the opportunity<br>and today i'm going to talk a little bit<br>about<br>um the community trust to papanui<br>indoley community trust that i'm the<br>deputy chair of<br>and and i'm going to talk a little bit<br>about<br>three initiatives that we have<br>currently been doing and<br>these are all connected to how we can<br>um make an impact on climate change so<br>just a little bit of background about te<br>papanui indali community<br>so<br>we feel that the community<br>of te papanoi have been kind of left<br>behind<br>for a long time<br>and we've been classified<br>as the second highest area in new<br>zealand for poverty and deprivation<br>so<br>our trust<br>the primary focus of our trust initially<br>was just to try and<br>help our community<br>with their health and well-being<br>so<br>we've worked very hard with the council<br>with funders with everyone and we've<br>we've seen big changes in our community<br>which has been fantastic<br>so<br>one of the things that we've been doing<br>is<br>firstly we went to the hamilton city<br>council and we said<br>outside of our building there is a big<br>park a large park<br>so we've asked the city council and they<br>have agreed to give us some trees to<br>plant around the edges<br>of our field of our land<br>because<br>not only will it<br>beautify the land<br>it'll also we want fruit trees that will<br>provide food for our people so our our<br>families our kids can come and pick<br>whatever fruit they need<br>from the trees that will be provided and<br>that's one of the things that we we've<br>been working on because trees are good<br>for the climate and good for the year<br>um living in a city of course you know<br>there's a lot of air pollution and<br>there's a lot of<br>children in our community that have<br>things such as asthma so hopefully we're<br>planning to make a difference by having<br>these fruit trees<br>planted<br>sometimes this in the next few months or<br>early next year<br>so that's one of our first projects and<br>we were really delighted that the city<br>council agreed to help us with that<br>the second<br>project that we've been working on<br>is that we decided that it was important<br>for our urban<br>community to learn some of our mato<br>ranga maori<br>in terms of planting so we have run some<br>workshops<br>on kumara planting and growing<br>and they have been so successful we've<br>been asked to<br>do them again<br>so<br>we will look at doing that next year<br>because kumara is one of our<br>important<br>plants and it's important for feeding<br>our people as well<br>so we would like to reintroduce our<br>maori knowledge<br>to our<br>whanau that<br>are working with now but also to our<br>children<br>so that brings us to the third project<br>that we've been working on and that is<br>that we've been<br>hoping and trying to get some funding<br>for a maracai a community garden<br>and now we have received some funding<br>so<br>we've had our ceremony because<br>we like to do our ceremonies with our<br>elders and everybody attended<br>and we've had the turning of the sod and<br>we're ready we're ready to<br>to develop this<br>maracai community garden<br>and<br>one of the exciting things about having<br>this community garden is not only can we<br>feed our people but<br>how people can learn<br>about<br>having gardens themselves our rangatahi<br>will help build the garden our elders<br>will come and talk about<br>traditional methods of gardening and<br>food production<br>and our little ones<br>will be able to<br>learn how to plant<br>things and pick<br>vegetables or whatever they choose to<br>and then our next aim or dream is to<br>get that model of gardening into all of<br>these homes so that everybody can grow<br>their own garden as well<br>so<br>i think that<br>by giving our people<br>the<br>the um education about our ancestral<br>knowledge<br>in terms of food production that's one<br>tiny step<br>forward<br>we have a lot of other plans but in<br>terms of climate change we've still got<br>a long way to go there's a lot of things<br>that we can do<br>we're teaching we have a<br>after-school<br>leadership course for our young children<br>and in that we teach them about<br>recycling we teach them about<br>you know um<br>healthy<br>healthy food we teach them all sorts of<br>things that they can take home<br>as well take home to their parents<br>and we hope that<br>this will continue<br>as well into the future we've got big<br>plans next year as well but<br>you know small steps and we we've seen a<br>huge<br>a change in our community for the better<br>um the children are happier everything<br>seems to be doing very well<br>so<br>we will continue on this journey<br>thank you all it's been very interesting<br>and i've got a lot of great ideas<br>that i will take back to the to the<br>trust and we'll see what else we can do<br>to help us<br>for looking at the past as maori<br>do we look at the past we look at the<br>present and then we look at the future<br>and how we can help our whanau and our<br>children move forward<br>teach them about what they can do to<br>help the climate and help our people so<br>thank you all kia ora<br>koto<br>thank you so much<br>thank you dr sharma i know he's had to<br>to leave us um<br>i really appreciate<br>you telling me about this community work<br>the development of gardens it parallels<br>in some ways some of the things that are<br>happening in the<br>less fortunate districts of manchester<br>and our neighbor city liverpool<br>i i remember<br>that<br>we had<br>a national wildflower center in<br>liverpool and there were these great<br>grassy areas around<br>tower blocks of social housing<br>when they planted<br>wildflowers<br>on in that grassland that made it<br>attractive people came down from their<br>flats and talk to each other and the<br>local doctors said that their health<br>improved enormously because they had<br>more social interaction<br>with the flowers as the catalyst that<br>got them going<br>growing crops having<br>urban gardens<br>shared gardens or your own garden if<br>you're lucky enough this is so important<br>and yet<br>the greenery<br>is helping take up<br>co2<br>it's all<br>contributing it's doing actions that<br>give multiple benefits<br>and that<br>is is really good to hear about<br>well i think<br>as time is marching on and bex has to<br>get things<br>ready in the next 20 minutes or so<br>could i thank you all very much indeed<br>for your contributions<br>can i say i admire<br>the hard work going on<br>in<br>communities preparing for climate change<br>and it's good to exchange the knowledge<br>and i hope that exchange will go on and<br>such initiatives will be supported by<br>local government<br>and<br>by national governments to<br>facilitate<br>this<br>policies for<br>surviving the climate change that my<br>generation people before me<br>have<br>caused<br>for present and future generations<br>i'm thinking at the age of 84 about my<br>grand<br>children's children and what a world<br>they will have if people aren't taking<br>the sensible sorts of actions we've been<br>talking about tonight thank you all for<br>your contributions<br>the university of waikato is proud to<br>introduce the world's first bachelor of<br>climate change for the people who know<br>there is no planet b<br>gain the skills needed for the jobs of<br>tomorrow<br>contribute to a fundamental shift in the<br>way we do business and go about our<br>lives<br>explore how ma tauranga maori can bring<br>perspective to the most pressing issue<br>of our time<br>apply now and carve a career where<br>so<br>thank you for joining us<br>and for being part<br>of this local<br>initiative<br>in the global context or is it a global<br>initiative<br>with a local context<br>whichever<br>our wrap-up today<br>features firstly<br>our vice chancellor<br>then we have<br>ian douglas<br>from the<br>manchester in england<br>margaret evans<br>of the commonwealth human ecology<br>and then myself<br>tom rua<br>associate professor<br>of the faculty of maori indigenous<br>studies<br>and then we'll end with our<br>karakia as we started<br>this time let's<br>please turn<br>and<br>share with ian<br>and some of his reflections<br>on what we have been doing over these<br>last few weeks<br>and perhaps<br>something of what we might be doing<br>thank you<br>very much tom and my<br>congratulations to all concerned but<br>particularly to margaret and to you<br>for a tremendous<br>set of<br>sessions<br>in the commonwealth human ecology<br>council<br>we were very anxious to<br>participate fully in<br>cop26 and<br>we heard via the grape line that the<br>more names we put forward for people to<br>attend the bigger the chance we would<br>have of having a handful of places<br>we hoped of course that conditions would<br>permit people<br>to come from distant countries from all<br>parts of the commonwealth but<br>unfortunately as it turned out with all<br>the travel restrictions and visa<br>difficulties and so on<br>those members of czech<br>who went<br>to<br>who have been in glasgow<br>came just from the uk so it's been<br>wonderful to have this opportunity of<br>communicating with people in<br>new zealand<br>uh about what has happened in glasgow<br>and particularly for me to<br>join<br>the sessions here and learn so much<br>about<br>the<br>innovative things<br>that have been happening<br>in this country<br>i'm impressed by<br>the general<br>understanding of the problem of climate<br>change<br>and the<br>uh<br>activity at all levels<br>today we heard from a member of<br>parliament about what the government had<br>been doing and in many ways<br>the government<br>was taking uh a lead among the world's<br>nations<br>on the other extreme we heard about what<br>different<br>maori communities had been doing in<br>hamilton and in other places and this<br>diff<br>whole different scales of discussion<br>different skills responsibility<br>different levels of involvement<br>really showed the way we have to go<br>forward<br>the way we have to go forward<br>is<br>to<br>work together<br>the whole thing about<br>climate change<br>has been<br>and and it's been here with us<br>for almost 40 years that we've been<br>talking about it is getting people to<br>realize that we all<br>in some way or other<br>are<br>responsible<br>for<br>the things that lead to climate change<br>some people much more than others<br>but we're all in one way responsible and<br>we all<br>have the responsibility<br>to do something<br>or more than one thing about it<br>uh<br>this week<br>we've been inundated with words and<br>pictures<br>about cop26 and illustrations of what's<br>been happening in other countries<br>to<br>someone like me who's been working up on<br>both the urban environment and<br>rainforests for the last 40 years<br>i've seen the enormous change that human<br>activity has produced across<br>cities<br>and across landscapes<br>the loss of forests the<br>expansion of cities into what had been<br>is an essential response to the great<br>increase in the global human population<br>now<br>what we've heard and know about now<br>are ways forward<br>where<br>we can<br>live<br>the sustainable livelihoods that we've<br>for<br>40 years<br>or 50 years since the<br>stockholm meeting on the environment in<br>1972<br>we<br>all these if we'd have gone down that<br>sustainable line<br>a bit earlier<br>we bit more effectively<br>uh we would have made<br>more progress<br>now at the last minute<br>we see that we all know what should be<br>done<br>and some wonderful people like those who<br>participated in these work or two<br>sessions<br>have been doing or are doing and will do<br>in the future<br>and<br>i'm still encouraged if you get enough<br>enthusiasm<br>and continue the momentum that's risen<br>at this time through cop26 and through<br>wonderful efforts like the those here<br>in this set of sessions<br>we will be able to do something<br>and<br>i<br>really<br>admire<br>the way everything has been conducted<br>here it's been<br>very good intellectually it's been very<br>effective technically and we owe an<br>enormous debt to the events people in<br>the university but uh i think i've been<br>very privileged to be with you at this<br>time and thank you for letting me do so<br>check is grateful to you for<br>what you have done and<br>recognizes now<br>that one of the side benefits<br>of this schedule pandemic has been this<br>ability of us to talk together<br>through things like zoom<br>and<br>bring<br>the<br>the commonwealth<br>and and or other organizations together<br>to<br>recognize the common purpose and to<br>learn the lessons rather more rapidly<br>than we used to uh before we had this<br>direct instant communication<br>ian thank you<br>uh the privilege<br>has entirely been ours in<br>your sharing your wisdom with us<br>and uh in terms of<br>being thankful for that privilege<br>we now turn to our vice chancellor<br>uh<br>neil quigley<br>to share some of his reflections<br>on cop 26<br>over the last two weeks the university<br>of waikato has offered an opportunity<br>for all new zealanders to think globally<br>and act locally<br>by entering our specially crafted portal<br>to share the experience of the 26th<br>conference of the parties in glasgow<br>we've assembled local commentators and<br>panelists to share their reflections of<br>climate challenges policy and action<br>and provided an opportunity for you to<br>use<br>our feedback service to share your views<br>a key benefit of this process has been<br>to bring together people who live and<br>work very near each other<br>but who previously had little direct<br>engagement on these issues of mutual<br>interest<br>it has also consolidated the thinking<br>and the interests of three key<br>institutions in the waikato region<br>the waikato regional council<br>waikato tainui<br>and the university of waikato<br>between our three institutions we expect<br>an ongoing program of engagement and<br>dialogue about climate issues to be a<br>key outcome of this initiative<br>i would like to thank tamata ahurangi<br>associate professor tom raw<br>margaret evans<br>and my colleagues at the university for<br>leading this initiative<br>in particular can i thank the university<br>events team<br>for all their work and for the long<br>hours they put in to bring this program<br>to you<br>i hope that all of you have found the<br>program informative and useful in<br>following and reflecting on the<br>conference of the parties and the very<br>important issues<br>foreign<br>thank you for<br>lending us your team<br>to enable<br>this sharing<br>of thought<br>but more of<br>what is actually being done<br>in this very very important question<br>and one of the thinkers<br>one of the doers<br>for some time in this space<br>is<br>former mayor of hamilton city<br>what a great couple of weeks it's been<br>and i want to also join you and vice<br>chancellor neil and professor ian and<br>say thank you to absolutely everybody<br>that's been involved<br>we suspect that there's been more than<br>60 panelists and they've all jumped to<br>this cause some of them with just a few<br>hours notice<br>which i think is a fine illustration<br>of the passion that is there<br>if we spend a bit of time looking at it<br>i do want to give a bit of an overview<br>um and as you have said tom and as<br>professor ian has said<br>this has been a subject that's been dear<br>to my heart for many decades and i don't<br>think i'm on my own if i say i was one<br>of the youthful readers of rachel<br>carson's<br>uh book way back in the 70s and ian<br>mentioned the stockholm conference which<br>is when the united nations first began<br>to address this issue of climate change<br>and the answer somehow being in what we<br>call sustainable development<br>and i want to make the first point here<br>that has been made by several of our<br>panelists this is not just about the<br>climate this is also about poverty<br>and it's particularly about urban<br>poverty which i think we need to take<br>note of and as<br>we've been<br>working through this last two weeks<br>it kept coming to me that sustainable<br>development<br>is actually about sustenance<br>and one of the things that we do need to<br>face up to is greed we are<br>a global society unfortunately that has<br>a culture of greed<br>and<br>i'm marking that as one of the first<br>points<br>i'm also going to go back to the<br>beginning uh two weeks ago<br>of glasgow<br>and that wonderful young woman who's now<br>a global<br>influencer i hope greta tonberg<br>and she used that expression blah blah<br>blah<br>well you know she will be joined by an<br>awful lot of people in this country and<br>in the city that will go on to say we<br>are a little bit sick of the blah blah<br>blah<br>what we do need now is<br>more action and what we need to do is<br>recognize there is already lots of<br>action and bring reaction together so we<br>have this magnificent molecule with all<br>its little tiny tiny bits all beavering<br>away<br>and that's how<br>we will make the change that we want to<br>make against<br>global warming<br>but also to pursue this vision<br>that's an ancient vision of a beautiful<br>world<br>where humanity works together uh with<br>nature<br>and i'm going to use the maori<br>expressions here tom<br>thanks to you and our mona fenua<br>in this country who are constantly<br>reminding us as they should<br>about<br>maori and i want to pick up just a few<br>of those expressions because they've<br>come through<br>time and time again in the last two<br>weeks here in hamilton one is<br>kaityakitanga<br>it is about integration<br>we are all mixed up together in this<br>place that we call home<br>planet earth<br>that's about kotahitanga<br>that's actually about leaders<br>and academics<br>and flex roots<br>all working together listening to each<br>other<br>and having call it all and tom you were<br>the one that used the term the one other<br>we need lots and lots and lots of<br>and we need to repeat them because we<br>have this lovely expression<br>about three readings of the bill<br>and yes it's quite right most of us need<br>to be told three times<br>before we finally get the message well<br>we've had more than three decades<br>so let's let's<br>work on that one of the other things<br>that came through time and time again in<br>glasgow<br>but also here<br>through our university of waikato host<br>has been systemic reform the status quo<br>is no longer an option<br>and i think rupert craig's made the<br>point<br>that<br>this is not about building bigger and<br>bigger and bigger sewage systems<br>this is about integrating systems with<br>mother earth using using the knowledge<br>of how mother earth operates to help us<br>fix up the problems we human beings<br>cause<br>innovate<br>and share the knowledge is the other big<br>message<br>i want to give three quick examples of<br>what i saw as some of the<br>priorities that came through<br>and i think na naya mahuta our minister<br>made reference of this right at the<br>beginning<br>and gaurav sharma our local mp<br>he also picked up the point<br>forestry<br>but the bad news is we don't want more<br>monocultural pine trees<br>we want the restoration of forest we<br>want the<br>rehabilitation of the land with the<br>forest canopy because<br>that also as a side one<br>should be something that we should take<br>into account for land restoration<br>but using timber<br>to build our houses<br>that was the point that's been made<br>several times<br>also transport was a big one and i think<br>there's been an open invitation that we<br>should all stomp on suvs and utes<br>that's the urban fashion it's all right<br>for the plumber and for the farmer<br>but hey hey come on come on yes and i<br>think as um ian has pointed out to us<br>public transport is very very important<br>but so is walking<br>and so is cycling and ian came up with a<br>very interesting point that covert has<br>had an impact<br>on public public transport in britain<br>because people are more reluctant it<br>seems to keep using it because of covert<br>and people who are not using their masks<br>so there's a learning for us as well<br>a summary<br>we need to reform our building<br>regulations we need to get rid of a lot<br>of red tape and this brings us back to<br>enderly<br>is a perfect opportunity to create<br>using the<br>local people to create a new village and<br>that's not just the buildings that's<br>also a place for them to gather as they<br>said to use their community gardens to<br>plant the fruit trees to let the people<br>get back to the idea of sustaining<br>themselves<br>in attractive<br>warm homes<br>solar panels there's so many elements<br>that could be incorporated in such a<br>design element and to go back to the<br>idea of urban forests i'm thinking of<br>the nature panel who reminded us again<br>and again<br>our children not only love to walk in<br>the bush<br>it is so good for them like it's good<br>for us<br>there is nothing more guaranteed to get<br>rid of stress<br>and re-engagement<br>with a walk and i can commend people<br>to the beautiful walks along the river<br>in the hamilton gardens<br>wonderful for the head wonderful<br>for the soul i'm going to make the final<br>point money does not cure everything but<br>as my scottish grandmother probably said<br>it's very helpful<br>and when<br>i think of the millions and in fact<br>billions<br>that<br>are available in the world today and i'm<br>not just talking about public dollars<br>i'm talking about philanthropic dollars<br>it is important that they go towards<br>some of<br>the big projects<br>but let's also not forget the small<br>groups who need to have the fruit trees<br>to plant in the gardens for their local<br>neighborhoods<br>and i'm going to conclude by just a<br>couple of numbers<br>for anybody visiting hamilton they will<br>be able to see the wide eddy drive<br>cobham drive intersection<br>where a new bridge is being built and<br>it'll be 150 million dollars before it's<br>finished<br>and that intersection alone<br>is costing 59 million dollars of<br>public money<br>well i know<br>what i would have sooner seen<br>that money spent<br>we've had a wonderful two weeks<br>it's now an opportunity for us to move<br>on to sharing this information<br>and thank you neil for the opportunity<br>to have<br>one<br>and share the information with more and<br>more and more people this is the ripple<br>on the lake<br>we've<br>put a little wave in there again<br>let's make this into ripples<br>thank you for the depth and the breadth<br>of those thoughts<br>and as you were talking i was watching<br>ian's body language<br>and there were some<br>real<br>nods as you were talking ian<br>do you want to comment on some of what<br>margaret has said<br>please i thought<br>margaret's ideas were very appropriate<br>um i just<br>would like<br>to<br>take up<br>the point about nature<br>in the urban areas<br>we<br>have<br>in many countries<br>urban green space standards<br>a child must be able to find a green<br>space within six minutes walk<br>there should be<br>a park<br>big enough to play in within a kilometer<br>and these standards are<br>very<br>sensible and they<br>often<br>show the disparity in the accessibility<br>of green space<br>the differences between poorer areas and<br>more wealthy areas often the wealthy<br>areas have more access but it's the<br>people in the poor areas who probably<br>need<br>more more access so<br>working towards that<br>sort of goal<br>is<br>working towards<br>mitigation of climate change uh there's<br>so many things like that that<br>are win wins you get so many benefits<br>out of<br>one project and i i do commend<br>that to to to everybody but i<br>i think<br>it's this<br>opportunity<br>that is now<br>there now people know each other<br>is to<br>engage<br>between<br>the national government<br>the region and the local governments<br>private enterprise<br>and the communities<br>and the scientists and scholars in<br>academia<br>and the people on the ground and<br>often it's the case that you have an<br>ideal<br>to<br>become involved and want to be<br>involved but<br>but how<br>do you<br>make that bridge<br>how do you get the academic to<br>talk to the farmers or the people<br>in the<br>communities what like what what way do<br>you<br>come to discuss this and<br>i<br>i found<br>when i was in a smaller town in<br>australia<br>they had a tradition of doing applied<br>research for the community i used to get<br>phoned out<br>this is such-and-such shire council<br>will you come and talk to us about our<br>plans for forestry or will you come and<br>talk to us about this can you find a<br>student to do a project which will tell<br>us that<br>and<br>in the end you end up<br>having<br>more people coming than you can cope<br>with but<br>it does help<br>actually<br>make you do<br>work that<br>answers<br>fundamental academic questions as well<br>as serving the community and and uh i've<br>not done quite as much of that as i have<br>since in manchester but i certainly<br>have<br>in check where we are encouraging<br>those<br>small projects that improve touch a lot<br>of people's lives and i think<br>i think that's the kind of<br>responsibility that<br>some academics at least need to carry<br>forward and keep carrying forward<br>and it's good to see<br>how much of it's going on with you<br>people in my tattoo<br>i i think<br>we've got<br>not let the momentum drop though if this<br>time the momentum drops<br>that fractions of a degree of global<br>warming will accelerate<br>uh<br>you know and<br>setting target dates makes everybody<br>think oh we don't have to do anything to<br>2030 or<br>2035<br>we have to do it now we should have done<br>it earlier<br>i about 20 years ago just before i<br>formally retired from the university<br>i said in the lecture to my students<br>on<br>in on my course on sustainable<br>development<br>you know<br>my generation has not done what it<br>should have done it's made a mess of the<br>earth it's up to your generation to try<br>to do some of it<br>and i was pleased when 10 years later i<br>came across one of the students who's<br>working for an environmental crisis he<br>said prof i listen to what you said i'm<br>actually doing it and and i think if we<br>can persuade a few people to be a bit<br>more like that student we will be in a<br>yeah thank you thank you<br>and i'm i'm taken by your saying that<br>academics talking to farmers<br>academics talking to grassroots people<br>grassroots people<br>challenging<br>academics and margaret you talked about<br>one number<br>you shared a thought a couple of days<br>ago<br>about a possible<br>uh movement<br>forward from this<br>and the vice chancellor mentioned it in<br>his address<br>would you like to expand a little bit on<br>that on that thought<br>well it grows every time i think about<br>it<br>um<br>i think i think bearing in mind we have<br>essentially a four-way or a three-way<br>partnership that we've developed here<br>which is the university of waikato<br>waikato tainui the local people<br>and of course the waikato regional<br>council you have to add into that<br>the various ngos<br>civil society<br>the representatives of the community so<br>you can see it's a it's an interesting<br>shape<br>but clearly they all want to call it or<br>more they all want to talk more they all<br>want to listen more so i think we should<br>respond to that<br>and it's important that<br>not one group hosts it all the time<br>i think it would be appropriate that the<br>university<br>as the digital host of this last two<br>weeks be the first place and with<br>fingers crossed about covert<br>we always have the fallback it can be<br>done with soon but it would be great to<br>have the kanohiki kanohi<br>gathering<br>and have it at the university and i'm<br>mindful for neil<br>that we always need to remember that for<br>many people the university is the other<br>place<br>it's not their place and it needs to be<br>their place and ian for your benefit it<br>sits in the most beautiful beautiful<br>grounds<br>it's like a park and we're better to<br>attract people to come to court at all<br>to listen and have a bit of a chat in<br>the park<br>while they're about it so i would say<br>that's the first place and tom<br>i think it would be wonderful to have<br>wakato tainui<br>to open the doors either to<br>which was always established as a<br>learning center<br>or<br>at your palace<br>why why how wonderful to again<br>engage with people who may never have<br>been there before and there's lots of<br>those too<br>the third pillar of course is the<br>waikato regional council<br>and it covers<br>ian the whole of<br>this center part of new zealand up to<br>auckland and to both coasts<br>and they've got magnificent new it has<br>said a green building<br>in the central city which would be<br>another wonderful place to have a one in<br>it and then if we were very very<br>adventurous we would go out into the<br>community<br>and you have had um jamie talker who<br>chairs the board at western community<br>centre which is quite a large place<br>and it would be wonderful to have uh um<br>a waialuanga beer but you've also got<br>vikka young<br>from<br>papua new guinea in delaware and there<br>is a school right there in fact there's<br>a couple of schools<br>right there<br>we have potential here<br>to take seminars out to the people<br>build on the discussions that as you<br>said in we've been having for the last<br>40 or 50 years<br>but more particularly over the last<br>two weeks<br>and remind people that two<br>thousand and thirty<br>eight years away<br>so we've got a bit of time and i think<br>we have to make them regular like<br>monthly<br>so that people get into the habit of<br>knowing that there's always a<br>conversation<br>going on about an interesting topic each<br>month<br>town talks<br>ted talks<br>waikato talks<br>yes<br>had this<br>mantra<br>no research without development<br>and no development without research<br>so uh by sharing these<br>over those spaces<br>ian are there other examples<br>internationally<br>where that has<br>um<br>yes um<br>after<br>the<br>big<br>rio de janeiro conference in 1992<br>pushing for sustainable development<br>the<br>un set up local agenda 21<br>and we had these committees and i was<br>in the end i ended up chairing the city<br>of manchester's local<br>agenda 21 forum it was a bit of a<br>toothless<br>committee but what was really a learning<br>curve was it had<br>five counselors and then it had three<br>academics three people from the business<br>community three people from uh<br>utilities three people from this group<br>and that group and<br>nature lovers and so on the 12 different<br>groups represented and that<br>that was a sort of top down formula<br>but<br>in fact<br>people<br>would discuss<br>things with each other and if<br>it had<br>a bit<br>power and or a bit more<br>financial clout it could be<br>very effective way of getting this but i<br>think<br>i think we need<br>patterns<br>of engagement<br>on specific activities<br>one of the activities that has<br>been most effective in the manchester<br>region in bringing people together has<br>been the restoration of former<br>industrial and mining land<br>where you<br>try to recreate a natural habitat<br>through um<br>regeneration and you you get the people<br>living around the area of the<br>old<br>coal mine waste tips or um<br>former<br>uh slag heaps<br>to to work on on the replanting and<br>carefully the pathways to put through it<br>help restore the rivers that sort of<br>engagement is is<br>it's very very effective and uh<br>we we have a very good model for that<br>in in greater manchester but<br>i think<br>it's only going to be sustained<br>when there is leadership<br>and when the<br>in these restoration projects there's<br>big government money coming in and and<br>paying<br>for some of the heavy work and but it is<br>a very effective way of engaging<br>with the communities and<br>i think there's no<br>there's no set way of doing it and you<br>have to have<br>people<br>who<br>want to do that little bit extra just<br>step outside<br>the normal job description and sometimes<br>you have to push the normal job<br>description aside to get on with what's<br>really important and i think that's what<br>we've been doing these last two weeks<br>thank you<br>margaret have you any sort of<br>that you might have missed out<br>only um it's interesting um<br>listen to ian talk about agenda 21<br>and ian you won't know this but hamilton<br>city and waikato region were the first<br>two in new zealand local bodies to pick<br>up<br>and adopt agenda 21<br>and um i could give a speech on this<br>that might last a couple of weeks but i<br>won't<br>we had over 4 000 people<br>involved in<br>workshopping<br>over<br>nearly two years<br>and all of that thought was condensed<br>down to one piece of paper which i now<br>promised to leaflet to everybody that we<br>called the cloud<br>and if you compare this with the united<br>nations sustainable development goals<br>they are identical and i bet you could<br>all talk about them what do people want<br>they want nature<br>they want<br>a safe place<br>they want a safe place<br>to raise their children<br>they want<br>opportunities for access to health care<br>they want opportunities for education<br>all of the things that humanities share<br>now<br>what is interesting is we did<br>an out to report<br>and the most common comment from all<br>these four thousand odd people it was<br>five thousand actually because we had a<br>thousand young people as well the most<br>common comment was the disappointment<br>they wanted the ongoing engagement and<br>i've never forgotten that because what<br>is the message people love to soak up<br>and talk about<br>and share the ideas and learn about the<br>ideas<br>but on the other hand they also want to<br>do something<br>and so you go from engagement to<br>participation<br>and<br>that is unchanging so you know ian your<br>point about manchester<br>links back to our point about enderly<br>uh we have an ideal opportunity in this<br>city<br>we've talked about peacocks being a new<br>greenfields area<br>but you haven't got the people in there<br>yet<br>you've got indonesia which is an<br>existing area which is right for<br>re-development<br>there's an opportunity there to do<br>everything we did under agenda 21<br>feed in some ideas let them talk about<br>them make them argue about them<br>everything from<br>the design of their houses to where they<br>want to put the community gardens notice<br>plural<br>and then let them<br>hands<br>on become engaged that's the unfailing<br>recipe i think everywhere from the<br>beginning of time when we had just small<br>units<br>the small units became bigger units<br>which gave us villages and they all<br>worked well when people felt they had a<br>place<br>where they felt they<br>had a future<br>and where they felt they had a past<br>and it was only when the villages got to<br>be bigger and the princess became greedy<br>with the idea of being kings<br>yes<br>i think<br>we can look back and resurrect some of<br>the<br>ideas<br>that are still valid<br>but the messages engagement<br>thank you margaret<br>and as the the local<br>face<br>of the commonwealth human ecology<br>council<br>i wonder if you might share some<br>um i thought about xena today not just<br>because<br>um<br>of our sessions coming to a conclusion<br>but to remind myself ian it's 10 years<br>it's 10 years that zena left us<br>and<br>for those who<br>don't yet know of her<br>i will just simply say<br>a new zealander<br>right to the day she died even though<br>she<br>had taken upon her heart to live in<br>london<br>oh really on and off probably from<br>immediately after the second world war<br>diminutive<br>beautiful her eyes<br>were almost ming blue<br>and i don't think there was a prime<br>minister or president who had not had<br>those eyes focused on them<br>as she sought<br>more<br>always more<br>to change the world<br>her concept of human ecology<br>combined the idea of kaitlyakitanga<br>but also<br>with i would add<br>her interest in buddhist and indian<br>concepts<br>of soul sharing<br>and<br>she<br>was determined i'm sure from the day she<br>was born<br>until the day she died that she would<br>make a better world<br>so hers was a great life<br>lived fully<br>contributed greatly and i'll conclude by<br>saying<br>including a great wallop from her estate<br>to the university of waikato<br>to fund<br>fellowships for the future and this<br>couple of weeks we've had shalini joffa<br>from the maldives who is the current<br>zener dash scholar and the more dives of<br>course being one of the small island<br>nations<br>that is threatened by climate change<br>so xena i have absolutely no doubts is<br>probably hovering around that mountain<br>of yours tom<br>looking down upon us<br>and i think would be very pleased with<br>the last two weeks in<br>i think so i think so<br>we<br>perhaps haven't put the message quite as<br>forcefully as xena would have put it<br>because she had that way of doing it<br>caring<br>for the world<br>caring for other people<br>but taking individual responsibility<br>yes<br>you've got to have something of<br>that element of fun<br>and that just that little<br>quirk<br>and everything that we do<br>so if i just uh<br>governor gray<br>meeting with one of our tupuna<br>and asking our tupuna<br>how many gods are there in the maori<br>pantheon<br>and our tupuna sedum<br>one<br>and grey says yeah but you've got rangi<br>and<br>al tupuna<br>yes<br>and they are one<br>we can't have rangi without papa<br>and we can't have papa without rangi<br>a<br>an orator<br>stands to speak<br>very often<br>that orator will begin<br>their speech with the phrase<br>tihei<br>maudiora<br>and in<br>that phrase<br>i suggest<br>that a teahei is a sneeze<br>and the maori ora<br>is about the well-being<br>of all everything<br>ian i really appreciate<br>your being with us<br>throughout these last two weeks<br>and i'm hopeful<br>that we might actually<br>meet kanohi<br>and be able<br>win the covert 19 restrictions<br>ease<br>we might have you here<br>and we might<br>share a meal<br>and take you to some of these spaces<br>margaret<br>thank you for being who you are and for<br>spearheaded spearheading<br>and really pushing me<br>along<br>and<br>pushing the university along<br>and to the university sean<br>aidan becks<br>all of you of the weinstein<br>tihei moji order<br>let's now turn to our kaumatua korotaki<br>tuna<br>to close us<br>but this is not the end<br>this is the end of<br>a continuum<br>and that continuum<br>we
