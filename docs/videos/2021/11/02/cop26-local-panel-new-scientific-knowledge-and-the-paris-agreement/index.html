action<br>committee<br>and i want to welcome you all to the<br>first panel of the<br>event to bring cop 26 to the waikato<br>region<br>we've got a lot of panels throughout the<br>week um always at 1 pm streaming and i<br>hope you enjoy<br>all that there is to learn about what's<br>going on overseas<br>to bringing people together to act on<br>climate change as well as hearing from<br>our local voices<br>around the region so the topic of<br>today's panel is the paris agreement and<br>the new science<br>so<br>it's kind of a great<br>introductory item to be starting on<br>because it's the science that's telling<br>us that we need to act on climate change<br>and um the latest science has come out<br>quite recently actually it was the sixth<br>iteration of the um<br>international plan<br>panel for climate change uh report so<br>called the ar6 report and um it's key<br>points that it's making is that we've<br>really got to reduce emissions to stay<br>below 1.5 degrees and especially two<br>degrees by making immediate rapid and<br>large scale reductions<br>it has actually also a summary for<br>policy makers which is really easy to<br>read so if you want to google that to<br>have a look<br>i highly recommend it some key points<br>from that latest science is that it's<br>unequivocal that human influence<br>has caused the warming that's happening<br>that the scale of warming seen in the<br>world is unprecedented<br>and that we are definitely seeing more<br>observed evidence so of of the events<br>that are happening and that there's less<br>noise in the data than ever before and<br>that the temperatures will keep going up<br>for quite a long time but unless we make<br>these rapid cuts um we will actually<br>really really struggle to keep it below<br>the agreed 1.5 degrees<br>um and so that there's a there's a bunch<br>of other points in there but i don't<br>want to hog the microphone too long so i<br>just mentioned briefly on the paris<br>agreement<br>so the u.n<br>um<br>is like 195 or so<br>countries that are a part of this and<br>that they have come up in 2015 with the<br>paris agreement so it's an international<br>treaty and it's legally binding and new<br>zealand signed up for that<br>and so<br>what where we're at now is<br>about six years down the track from<br>there and and what that paris agreement<br>really asked everybody to do is to keep<br>is to<br>contribute to<br>um changing our economy and social<br>systems to reduce emissions so that we<br>can stay preferably between one under<br>1.5 degrees and ideally well below two<br>degrees<br>so last year cop was 26 was meant to<br>happen but it didn't because of the<br>covered epidemic pandemic and so here we<br>are in 2021<br>with the first five year cycle happening<br>so the framework of the paris agreement<br>is that every five years<br>the member countries will come to the<br>table with a new<br>target of and plan of what they're going<br>to do to reduce emissions and um you<br>will have heard in the news over the<br>last couple of days that new zealand is<br>pledging uh<br>halving its emissions by 2030 and<br>there's a whole lot of detail around<br>that that you can read up about as well<br>but the intention is that every five<br>years we're going to keep ratcheting up<br>the<br>the ambition<br>and internationally from everyone and so<br>it's there's some critical<br>kind of milestones to hit and this cop<br>26 is really important<br>so<br>that's where we're at at the moment um<br>also we'll be held accountable to um<br>meeting those targets and we'll be<br>getting recommendations on how to make<br>our plans better and better so in some<br>ways it feels like the beginning which<br>it shouldn't be because action should<br>have been taken many decades already<br>before but um here we are and um i'm<br>really really happy to say that from my<br>place in the world here in the waikato<br>representing hamilton leading the<br>climate action committee<br>there are frameworks that have been put<br>in place thanks to the paris agreement<br>frameworks like the xero carbon act that<br>um the government has brought in and<br>then even our regional approach that<br>we're doing so i've got here to show you<br>that you can't really see because i've<br>got the blurring on is we've got a<br>climate action roadmap which has some<br>interesting detail in on how the paris<br>agreement links to our national<br>legislation which then links to some of<br>our regional work which is as i can see<br>coming together to give us<br>even more localized action plans on how<br>to make a difference and so i'm really<br>looking forward to seeing um you know<br>how we can all learn about this topic<br>together and how<br>we can um act to make those a reality<br>all the way up until it shows in the<br>data that people are debating again and<br>the um<br>in the cops<br>the conference of the party kind of<br>events that happen in the future to hold<br>our country to account next to everybody<br>else as well so i hope that helps a<br>little bit uh to understand um from from<br>that perspective<br>i'm going to pass you on to um<br>one of uh<br>the wacom regional council<br>um employees who is i'm very<br>knowledgeable in the space of climate<br>and then we'll go through the rest of<br>the panel um to to share a little bit<br>more and have a bit of a chat afterwards<br>amongst ourselves so you can learn as<br>much as possible i'll hand over to blair<br>yeah<br>so<br>uh cool player dickie tokuing away<br>thank you counselor nichol<br>i'm a principal strategic advisor with<br>the regional council in the strategy and<br>policy implementation section i've been<br>working in the field of climate change<br>for almost two and a half decades now<br>and i've been<br>following the international<br>uh<br>agreements as they come out of the uh<br>unfccc over those years and the<br>uh local<br>and national responses to those and how<br>they affect regional council functions<br>and<br>they affect everything we do and<br>everything we do in the future will be<br>affected not just by physical<br>changes in our climate but also our<br>responses and that is the government's<br>response with respect to pricing of<br>emissions and also the recognition that<br>we need to<br>work in a cabin-constrained economy from<br>now on<br>i've been<br>i've attended one uh conference of<br>parties it's a long time ago now in 2002<br>that was what was known as cop 8 at<br>delhi and that was an interesting time<br>internationally because it followed the<br>two key ones of kyoto and marrakesh<br>that put in the<br>framework around the kyoto protocol<br>and also it followed directly a couple<br>of months after the 2002 johannesburg<br>birth summit or rio plus 10.<br>what i'd like to do is just talk a bit<br>about and<br>councillor nicholl talked about the<br>paris agreement but go back a little bit<br>further and look at how science has<br>influenced the way the world has has<br>changed and you can see that some of the<br>key<br>um<br>agreements that have been made through<br>the united nations framework convention<br>on climate change have occurred because<br>the science has been<br>made available through the<br>intergovernmental panel on climate<br>change<br>we've just been talking about the or<br>heard about the<br>sixth assessment report but back in 2001<br>the ipcc i'll call it ipcc um just<br>because it's easier uh released its<br>third assessment report or just commonly<br>known as the tar<br>and uh that really<br>uh<br>gave a lot of impetus to the climate<br>component of the<br>johannesburg earth summit in 2002 moving<br>on a couple of years<br>ar4 the fourth assessment report came<br>out in 2007 and that very much and we<br>were at that stage working through the<br>kyoto protocol but that preceded what<br>was known as cop 15 in copenhagen<br>and that was quite a an important one<br>started to<br>work us away as a as um<br>international agreements by recognizing<br>that it wasn't just<br>a um a two-stage approach we needed like<br>um<br>was covered in the kyoto protocol where<br>the world was divided up into developed<br>economies and developing nations where<br>it was recognized that those developed<br>nations had got rich on the back of<br>fossil fuel emissions<br>and<br>we needed to recognize and<br>support<br>the developing nations into<br>their projects<br>but<br>i've just had something come up my<br>screen sorry um but uh what it did it<br>recognized that developing nations were<br>fast becoming um big emitters in their<br>own right and this was india china and<br>the like and let's change the direction<br>there so we had<br>then in 2014<br>the fifth assessment report which um<br>really for the first time started to<br>provide the science that<br>attributed changes to various changes or<br>degrees of warming and we got very soon<br>after in 2015<br>the cop 21 the paris accord where it was<br>recognized that<br>1.5 degrees was a critical threshold<br>that we shouldn't really exceed if we<br>were going to um not change the planet<br>too much so that's that's<br>really where we had now<br>from that paris agreement three things<br>came out of it first one was the i<br>mentioned before 1.5 degrees was was a<br>key figure<br>and the<br>wording i think was that we would keep<br>emissions well below 2 degrees but aim<br>for 1.5 there was also climate financing<br>recognising that we would change the<br>climate as we go on but we needed to<br>support<br>nations that were going to be<br>affected both in the physical effects of<br>climate change but also to transition<br>their own economies and as councilor<br>nicol mentioned<br>ambition was built into it because<br>the<br>way that the paris agreement worked was<br>it moved from having<br>and annex one countries and nx2<br>countries from the kyoto protocol to<br>recognizing all countries needed to be<br>involved but they were given the<br>flexibility of<br>saying how they were going to be<br>involved and these were called<br>nationally determined contributions or<br>ndcs<br>and the indices that were tabled in<br>paris<br>would only get us to somewhere between<br>plus 2.7 and plus 3.5 degrees which was<br>not a gap not enough<br>and that therefore ambition was built<br>into this and so this year we've had um<br>we have cop 26 and we've had the ipcc's<br>sixth assessment report to support it<br>um now the sixth assessment report has<br>been the most comprehensive to date<br>we've had in 2000<br>or series of reports 2018<br>some science that showed the difference<br>between a plus 1.5 world and a plus two<br>degree world and it is significant<br>and then we had in 2019<br>the um report on the oceans and the<br>cryosphere and the changing climate and<br>we had in august this year working group<br>ones the science of climate change so<br>that is there out<br>so that negotiators can can um pick it<br>up<br>i think i'll probably conscious of time<br>not wanting to take too much too much<br>out of the discussion later on but just<br>to say that and i think i've probably<br>picked this up from somewhere but i<br>don't know where if paris was the<br>promise<br>glasgow's the delivery<br>and before leaving i'd like to hand over<br>with<br>my name is lorraine dixon and i<br>currently hold the climate change<br>portfolio for waikato tainui<br>and i'm just hoping that my powerpoint<br>presentation actually works<br>um<br>we are defined by our land<br>our river<br>our history<br>and the king<br>we are a proud people each of us<br>descended from the intrepid voyages who<br>crossed the ocean to land the tainui<br>waka on the shores of kaffir in the 13th<br>century<br>led by hoturoa<br>these two punar lefrangiate to discover<br>a new land<br>rich in fertile soils abundant wildlife<br>bordered by a plentiful supply of<br>kaimuana<br>when kingitafiao fled the king country<br>after the land wars of 1863-64<br>he provided his people with an enduring<br>message<br>to<br>more than 23 years ago we have focused<br>on building a platform that is stable<br>and solid to realize the aspirations set<br>out in fakatuburanga 2050 and enlivening<br>the words of king itafail<br>in the ever-changing global environment<br>our world our future generations live in<br>will be significantly different to ours<br>so our approach for moving forward is<br>one that embraces change and focuses on<br>developing our people<br>we have navigated through the highs and<br>lows of modern tribal life and are now<br>valued at over 1.3 billion dollars<br>our registered tribal members have grown<br>from 20 000 in 1995 to over 74 000 today<br>we now have a unique opportunity to<br>reposition ourselves so that we are fit<br>for the future as we move into the next<br>phase together<br>to realize the aspiration laid out in<br>2015 we must build on the work already<br>completed and continue to make a<br>positive difference in the lives of our<br>members attended three workshops during<br>the year and provided great guidance on<br>where we should focus in the next five<br>years<br>what we heard was that we need good<br>information and data to support decision<br>making<br>and that we must also work collectively<br>to leverage activities to increase our<br>impact<br>we must also build skills in our people<br>so our whanau and marai can work towards<br>achieving their own mana motuhake<br>there are some great opportunities ahead<br>and we are excited about what the future<br>holds for our tamariki and mukupuna<br>it will require the best of ourselves to<br>create a better future for this and the<br>next generation of waikato tainui<br>yahoo<br>to grow<br>so wait this is waikato toni wherever it<br>consists of 30 33 happy<br>68<br>whakakitanga marai and we roughly around<br>are reaching 80 plus thousand tribal<br>members<br>and<br>waikato is a tribal authority that<br>represents<br>tribal members of those 68 marae of<br>tifaka kitanga waikato and tribal<br>members elect two members from the marae<br>to represent them for three years on<br>tiwaka kitana or waikato and for us<br>waikato<br>means people who descend from our<br>affiliate<br>uh to implement the training program<br>and part of the tohu taiyo is to<br>advocate for climate change in relation<br>to water rights and environmental<br>activities and to facilitate work<br>streams to<br>achieve a desired outcome<br>we have our tai chumu tau pari taiao<br>waikato tainui environmental plan that<br>seeks to describes a position for<br>waikato tonuri with respect to the<br>environment and to the context and<br>perspectives of waikato tinawi<br>we are excited but very serious about<br>the new climate change initiatives<br>particularly in the training<br>program and building the capacity of our<br>people so that our tribal members can<br>build<br>again their capacity to be the experts<br>in their fields so they can support<br>their murdae around the environmental<br>issues<br>and also be paid for being the industry<br>experts<br>so<br>this aligns with<br>faka<br>and becoming part of world leaders and<br>support self-sustainability and in mana<br>motuhaki as aspirations<br>and also managing their natural natural<br>resources<br>to climate change is<br>um<br>looking<br>into what issues towards managed<br>retreats for marae and hapu<br>that resides<br>along our tupuna and our moana bring<br>will it be another form of dispositions<br>of lands again where iwi hapu and marawi<br>may end up being forced off their<br>traditional lands thus severing the<br>relationship and connectedness to the<br>attire as part of their cultural way of<br>life<br>so<br>under the sustainability of our waters<br>ways<br>uh waikato tainui is very eager to look<br>into solutions that takes the pressure<br>off our waterways and reverse the<br>impacts of of those waterways so for us<br>if climate change is the tanifa then<br>water will be its teeth<br>so for waikato tonui in terms of<br>investing we want to investigate where<br>we should be putting our efforts into<br>climate change and waikato tony i wanted<br>to do action now<br>we don't want to talk anymore but action<br>on the ground directly at our model so<br>they can become resilient through the<br>storm of the climate change<br>these are what we call the lifeline<br>legacies for survival<br>we are looking to overseas to our<br>indigenous phenomena all over the globe<br>and to honor<br>with them and share what works and what<br>doesn't<br>and to also look at<br>what the preparedness plan for climate<br>change looks like in particular their<br>resilience strategies and plans of<br>action<br>all of which is matadanga focus<br>so mataranga is part of what we think is<br>best science but it's not taken<br>seriously in the colonial world<br>but it should be<br>so in the paris agreement and within the<br>preamble it talks about the rights of<br>indigenous peoples local communities<br>migrants children<br>persons with disabilities and people in<br>vulnerable situations<br>and the right to development<br>as well as the gender<br>equality empowerment of women in<br>intergenerational equity<br>it also talks about recognizing the need<br>to strengthen knowledge<br>technologies practices<br>and efforts of local communities and<br>indigenous<br>peoples related to addressing and<br>responding to climate change<br>and also establishing a platform for the<br>exchange of experiences and sharing of<br>best practices on mitigation adaptation<br>we here we take our role as kaichaki<br>very seriously our role as kaijuki<br>is the very essence why we have survived<br>we continue to make the ultimate<br>commitment to manage our resources at a<br>stricter level than that of the national<br>standards<br>and centralize this around whakapapa and<br>whanau needs and aspirations to be the<br>iwi hapu emirai to hold fast to the<br>connection<br>with our tile while enhancing that<br>precious relationship<br>this is to ensure that the connection<br>and its relationship to our tile<br>addresses fundamental challenges of the<br>taniwha called climate change<br>our materanga a<br>is a major part of the solution for us<br>and science and technology is another<br>fatu that binds it together but that<br>fatu needs to be tight and in sync to<br>address the challenges we face in the<br>every changing world<br>so when cop 26<br>tries for the 26th time to get things<br>right the leaders need to fashion their<br>house with the humble trees of the<br>forest that nurtures protects and binds<br>us together to ensure that we have a<br>chance to survive in the future healthy<br>world<br>and i'll pass it over to<br>nikki<br>lorraine my name is nikititotawa i'm a<br>pawar here with niwa<br>a cri<br>national institute<br>our<br>work has been very very important in<br>the effects of climate<br>or climate has always been important to<br>maori<br>so within newa there there was<br>established in um<br>in the organization by<br>by two parties<br>uh to inform those choices uh a maori<br>environmental research centre and the<br>national climate center<br>who developed research programs specific<br>to climate and maori society<br>within<br>this is the hub of where that happens<br>and it's quite important for us to um<br>sort of emphasize in that is that our<br>work streams under the climate and maori<br>society program<br>primarily<br>is is providing advice to iwi hapu and<br>maori<br>maori business especially as well on<br>climate change<br>impacts and implications we also provide<br>council<br>when asked to<br>by a central government<br>and international bodies such as the<br>ipcc<br>and provide assessments different risks<br>across<br>the whole of new<br>zealand the other one that newers also<br>produced as a range of publications<br>which have been peer-reviewed papers<br>technical reports popular articles<br>presentations and<br>um posters which<br>were prepared by apanui skipper and<br>darren darren king<br>darren<br>dr darren king is our expert in the<br>climate change area<br>um probably the best person to be<br>positioned in<br>in this in the most knowledgeable in<br>fact within the organization due to my<br>role as um<br>relationship leader development lorraine<br>has asked me to come on board to to<br>support the tribe and<br>which which is very very important to me<br>because as she explained she expressed<br>the<br>the hub which is called the whaka<br>kittinga which i am a rep on as well so<br>i'm not only um working in the science<br>and technical end or the researching but<br>also from a tribal uh end making sure<br>and ensuring that education towards<br>on greenhouse<br>gas which is really important because<br>we're pretty pretty proactive and<br>actually causing a lot of that that<br>damage without being educated<br>so in terms of what we would um<br>or what i would understand<br>in those impacts<br>is um with the with the paris agreement<br>although the focus is mainly on<br>greenhouse gas mitigation<br>um or dealings<br>we don't we we do very very our research<br>is very very um or contributions are<br>quite minimal<br>aaron also<br>expressed to me to emphasize how<br>at best we promote the development of<br>emission profiles for ewe happy<br>authorities and we<br>provide perspectives on policies such as<br>recommendations given in the recent<br>climate change commission report<br>um pretty much<br>if i was to look at our cri involvement<br>that's pretty much as basic as i can<br>cover<br>but the important thing would be as to<br>support the presentation that was given<br>by lorraine is it is also important for<br>us to through our maori<br>uh maori society program we're able to<br>to walk alongside waikato tainui<br>in saying that too<br>we need to<br>look at the relationship and the<br>engagement with with a more solid and<br>firm focus and of course at the moment<br>we're going through<br>and various other<br>parties and connectivities throughout<br>thai new group holdings<br>and<br>whanau and hapu<br>on a mandated document called a<br>memorandum of understanding yet to be<br>achieved<br>so thank you very very much for the<br>opportunity as brief and short as it is<br>i did learn a lot about the paris<br>agreement over the weekend<br>because in my mind i have not<br>really<br>grew any further than my work capacity<br>or role or responsibility but now i have<br>a real good and much better focus on not<br>accountability<br>and i would like to hand it over to<br>is it you louie the handsome guy in the<br>bottom left corner<br>it's actually me nickitti<br>so i'm margaret barber the dean of<br>the dean of science at university of<br>waikato so my expertise is in plant<br>science<br>and my research has particularly focused<br>on the environmental effects of<br>plants<br>um both crop plants and also managed and<br>so<br>i've worked on this for many years um<br>and in fact when i was doing my phd<br>my supervisor was one of the people who<br>was on the australian delegation who<br>went to kyoto to negotiate the protocol<br>the agreement over there and so that was<br>a weird time for me as a student i<br>didn't have access to my supervisor but<br>i did have access to<br>some discussion on what it's like to be<br>in those situations when you're talking<br>about science<br>but in a political context<br>it's not something i wanted to engage<br>with myself but an interesting<br>outsider's perspective nonetheless<br>so the kyoto protocol was really<br>one of the very first steps to<br>the the world taking on this issue of<br>climate change and the scientists were<br>pretty sure that we needed to do<br>something really serious about it in the<br>mid 90s when when the kyoto um<br>meeting happened<br>um but then you know other things got in<br>the way<br>and<br>some of the major emitting countries<br>they<br>didn't meet their commitments and they<br>actually backed out of the protocol so<br>when the paris agreement was was<br>organized and agreed to in 2015 there<br>was a great celebration among scientists<br>yay we're finally being listened to<br>because countries were committing to<br>reductions in emissions and they were<br>committing to<br>changing the way our business worked and<br>and then a couple of you have already<br>mentioned the um the ic ipcc report<br>which came out earlier this year which<br>made it really really clear that<br>scientists are absolutely<br>certain that the climate is changing<br>that humans are causing it and that we<br>need to do something really really soon<br>um<br>and it's not just it's not just<br>scientists saying this now people around<br>the world are seeing wildfires and<br>they're seeing um floods and they're<br>seeing um storm surge and sea level rise<br>affecting their their land<br>um and their waterways<br>and so<br>um as a scientist i feel like um<br>the<br>the people around the world are getting<br>behind us<br>and um<br>agreeing with us but our leaders are not<br>and i was really disappointed this<br>morning to read that the g20 meeting<br>failed to reach agreement on phasing out<br>coal<br>so disappointing because it absolutely<br>needs to happen it needs to happen fast<br>and that has unfortunately been blocked<br>it seems by russia china and australia<br>um which is i think very disappointing<br>so there was some sentiment in the in<br>the priest this morning that um perhaps<br>the paris agreement is floundering<br>somewhat i really really hope it's not<br>and i'm quite i'm quite hopeful that we<br>can<br>agree to reduce emissions um and then<br>and that they'll be fast enough to to<br>stop the very worst impacts of climate<br>change<br>but i'm actually as a scientist i'm kind<br>of interested in why<br>people like me have been saying for<br>three decades this is a big problem we<br>need to do something about it why is it<br>that we're being ignored<br>and there's all sorts of interesting<br>ideas that<br>in the end<br>seem to come across<br>conspiracy theories but things like well<br>there were big um you know big fossil<br>fuel companies who were talking to the<br>politicians or maybe there was some<br>religious ideology that was guiding them<br>or they're just narcissists who who work<br>with the media and ignore experts so all<br>of those things are probably<br>contributing to it<br>but um<br>i think what it really boils down to is<br>that climate change is a really<br>complicated<br>issue that spreads its tentacles into<br>all aspects of life on earth<br>um and that that makes it<br>really tricky to deal with if it was<br>just about the science we would have<br>solved it quite some time ago but<br>because it blends into economics and<br>politics<br>it becomes<br>an equity issues and even colonialism it<br>becomes really quite tricky um for<br>people to to actually deal with it<br>um and so maybe i could just give you an<br>example from my own life<br>when i was working in australia i had an<br>opportunity to talk to the prime<br>minister of the time about my own<br>research<br>and i wanted to talk about climate<br>resilient<br>wheat crops and i was working on<br>developing<br>different genotypes of wheat that would<br>be climate resilient and so i had this<br>really fancy equipment that was<br>measuring the exchange of carbon and co2<br>and water between the atmosphere and the<br>leaves and i had other really fancy<br>equipment that was um tracing molecules<br>of carbon and water from the atmosphere<br>into the plants and back out again and i<br>was very excited to talk to the prime<br>minister about my work<br>unfortunately<br>she latched on to this idea that my work<br>would be producing wheat that would take<br>more co2 out of the atmosphere because<br>they were photosynthesizing more<br>that was part of the goal but she<br>extended that to being that this would<br>help reduce carbon emissions<br>this is not what i meant at all<br>and<br>she was about to launch into a um<br>re-election campaign<br>and so she was very distracted and i<br>wasn't able to explain to her that my<br>work wasn't about ambitions reduction it<br>was about climate resilience because i<br>as a scientist i didn't have that<br>communications training and she didn't<br>have the time and mental space to stop<br>and listen to what i was trying to say<br>and i wondered<br>if perhaps i'm a typical scientist<br>and that maybe i have an idea of what<br>what my contribution is<br>and i'm trying to balance<br>communicating that contribution with<br>maintaining my scientific rigor<br>which is very important to me um and<br>and that the balance is never right and<br>the communication is never clear enough<br>and simple enough for the politicians to<br>grab hold of and understand<br>um<br>so that was that was my disappointment<br>from a while ago and this was a prime<br>minister who brought an admissions<br>trading scheme to australia it didn't<br>last very long but she did do it so it<br>wasn't like she was um a climate change<br>denier as some politicians in australia<br>have been<br>um<br>so i'm wondering um<br>if<br>what we really need is for<br>well and other people have said this i'm<br>not i'm not the only one who said this<br>but for<br>people in power to trust the experts who<br>are saying this is important we need to<br>do something about it needs to happen in<br>either they need to be trained<br>scientists themselves that's not<br>probably going to happen or they need to<br>be willing to trust their experts<br>because what i'm scared of is that the<br>phd students that i'm training right now<br>will be in the same position<br>in 20 years time as me right now saying<br>i tried to explain it but i couldn't and<br>they wouldn't listen<br>and um<br>i would hate that to be the case and i<br>would hate for<br>cop26 to not produce what it needs to<br>produce for all of us<br>uh<br>i'll leave there tina go to kato and may<br>i please pass over to my colleague louis<br>shipper<br>kyotato<br>kara tofinoko<br>when the land is well people are well<br>this is somebody described my research<br>group because that was at the center of<br>what we're trying to do<br>so my name is louis shipper i'm a<br>professor at the university of waikato<br>and<br>we are interested in trying to find ways<br>of decreasing our impacts on on the<br>environment and we have a specific<br>interest in<br>greenhouse gas emissions<br>from agriculture now from um the last<br>paris uh accord<br>during that time they came up with<br>something called the four per ml<br>initiative<br>and what they were trying to do here was<br>that they said if<br>we could increase the world carbon<br>content of soil by 0.4 percent four<br>parts per thousand<br>year on year we could offset a huge<br>amount of our greenhouse gas emissions<br>and so that was an enormous call<br>to the research committee uh or<br>community um to look at ways of storing<br>more carbon and soil and and so there's<br>been a lot of interest in that and<br>particularly in aotearoa<br>and the challenge for us is that our<br>soils already have quite high carbon<br>stocks<br>and so getting more carbon into those<br>soils is quite challenging<br>and our work and that of other people<br>around new zealand<br>has has tried to look for those kind of<br>solutions and we're continuing to look<br>for ways of increasing carbon stocks and<br>getting co2 out of the atmosphere but<br>one of the things that we have<br>focused on also is that we need to keep<br>and protect the carbon that sits in the<br>soil it's kind of the sole of the soil<br>where it is<br>so we've got to look after<br>after that soil to keep that carbon<br>there<br>and and so<br>while it might be difficult to increase<br>carbon in new zealand soils we need to<br>make sure we don't lose it and one of<br>the areas that i want to draw to<br>attention here is the role of the<br>peatlands of new zealand<br>they only represent maybe one percent of<br>our land area uh they used to be and and<br>still remain some of the most<br>iconic remarkable ecosystems that we<br>have kubota guanajuato<br>mourinho uh in the waikato<br>they're they're quite remarkable they're<br>10 14 meters deep of old organic metal<br>plant material that is no longer<br>decaying or slowly became it's<br>accumulated over<br>10 000 years or so taking co2 out of the<br>atmosphere<br>now we have drained these<br>peats not all of them but a large<br>proportion of them<br>and we use them to produce<br>food milk<br>particularly<br>um<br>and about half of new zealand's<br>peatlands are in the waikato<br>there's a large chunk in southland and<br>northland and scattered around new<br>zealand as well<br>so uh these systems once you drain them<br>um that heat starts to decompose the air<br>gets in you get decomposition<br>and it releases co2<br>now we have done some back of the<br>envelope calculation so they are what<br>they are but they might represent<br>somewhere between five and ten percent<br>of new zealand's total greenhouse gas<br>emissions<br>that's a really big number and so we<br>need to find<br>ways in waikato<br>and around the world<br>to decrease the size of those emissions<br>so that so that we can protect and hold<br>on to those<br>hold on to that carbon and maybe we can<br>find a way of reversing it and turning<br>these agricultural peatlands back into<br>systems that are fixing co2 out of the<br>atmosphere so that we have a new<br>kapootai<br>uh forming a fungal reno<br>that takes co2 out of the atmosphere and<br>also<br>uh contributes to biodiversity right the<br>plants that we want uh to bring back the<br>fern bird more and the lizards that are<br>housed in these quite remarkable<br>environments<br>so those solutions are tough<br>they require way more than just science<br>even though the science is really<br>challenging<br>they require society<br>here we<br>all of us to try and find a solution<br>that works for all of us and this is not<br>just important for us in new zealand but<br>it is one of the key<br>uh wedges that we will need if we want<br>to solve climate change<br>where we<br>we we do small bits together<br>so that we can solve the whole problem<br>um<br>i'll hand back to<br>jen<br>thank you louie and um and i see we have<br>about five minutes or or so left so um<br>please have a think about any of the<br>panelists if there is a another minute<br>or so or a comment you'd like to make<br>after hearing all of these other<br>speakers um i mean really we've we've<br>been thrown together to share our<br>perspectives um on on this topic and it<br>is only the first panel of um<br>i think about another 11 to go over the<br>next couple of weeks<br>which will cover a whole lot of topics<br>about how to<br>dress<br>things here in the waikato as our<br>contribution towards the bigger hole<br>for myself i think one of the things<br>that i've realized um over the course of<br>it is something we where as as margaret<br>said it is so complex and touches so<br>many things that there really is no way<br>to get away from it to get these changes<br>so it is something for everyone there's<br>not a problem for someone else to think<br>about and one of the most powerful<br>things we can do<br>is to have conversations like this<br>whether they're pre-arranged or thrown<br>together or whichever way to get to know<br>other people who know some stuff about<br>this<br>and and figure out what we can do about<br>it and so<br>yes i<br>will just<br>open it up to let blair or we can go in<br>the same order as last time and if<br>somebody wants to pass then just pass it<br>on and then we'll whip it up thank you<br>everyone<br>go blair<br>thanks counselor um i'd just like to<br>comment on something that margaret<br>mentioned and that's the<br>link between science and decision making<br>and the communication of science i think<br>it's absolutely critical here<br>and the<br>personal anecdote you shared there<br>with the australian pm i'm i'm just not<br>surprised that that<br>um<br>what was uh the way things turned out<br>because when you actually look at how<br>the<br>um<br>climate change response globally has<br>moved over the years it started out as<br>emissions reductions and it really<br>didn't pick up on<br>the<br>need to consider that we weren't these<br>weren't working and we are changing the<br>the climate and we will have impacts and<br>we do need to adapt<br>the requirement for nation states to um<br>include adaptation and their domestic<br>responses only came through<br>um six years ago in the paris agreement<br>adaptations mentioned there that it's<br>not really in<br>at any sort of level other than<br>the<br>um recognition that we needed to provide<br>financing but financing is seen<br>internationally in in two ways it's the<br>way to adapt to a changing climate but<br>also to<br>offset emissions through clean<br>development<br>protocols and mechanisms he also made<br>the point there about<br>what skills do leaders need to have and<br>i've often been<br>sort of i've been reminded over the<br>years that the uk is well advanced in<br>the way it's treated um climate change<br>and it's changing its its economy to be<br>a lot less carbon intensive and it all<br>goes back to margaret thatcher<br>she was a chemist she got it<br>that's when the change occurred she did<br>a whole lot of other things but she got<br>this<br>oh you're still mute<br>get you to admit yourself<br>i'm just making a<br>comment of uh my little town in bahrui<br>poker in huntley where<br>we have<br>four more eyes surrounded by a coal<br>power plant<br>and just recently due to the<br>nature of the waikato river where there<br>was hardly any water<br>the the power station was forced to find<br>other<br>ways<br>to<br>supply energy by<br>once again um<br>burning coal<br>and the consequences of<br>over time since it was initiated back in<br>when it started up in 1983<br>right up to<br>today<br>we had<br>that particular maori community head<br>has had respiratory<br>the kohang ariel at the mirai higher<br>ongoing<br>respiratory health<br>issues as well as<br>respiratory deaths<br>um<br>so um<br>and<br>and as new zealand is entering into um<br>um and meeting the paris agreement how<br>was it that<br>we're still polluting<br>and how was it that<br>our our people are getting uh the<br>brunt end of it<br>they talk about tipping points but from<br>an indigenous person<br>myself<br>and as maori<br>some communities like my community<br>the tipping point has already been<br>tipped<br>and that we're now having health<br>consequences from it<br>so<br>um<br>i'm just<br>you know this like i said in in when i<br>was doing my presentation this is this<br>26th<br>cop<br>how many more cop<br>meetings do we have to have until they<br>get it<br>and i<br>and i just feel like that our people<br>as well as other indigenous people<br>are saying right that's enough<br>you know if there's no action right now<br>we're going to go ahead and do it<br>ourselves and start preparing for the<br>inevitable<br>um<br>and we don't want to be in that<br>situation<br>but<br>if we're going to have the more<br>you know they on more promises and no<br>action<br>then i think that's the people on the<br>ground like our marae our ewe our<br>communities will start doing action<br>themselves<br>i think through the humble trees of the<br>forest who are not the global leaders<br>but the communities<br>maori communities<br>and all of us getting together at the<br>ground level<br>we are considered the humble trees of<br>the forest and<br>um after looking at quite a bit of<br>information and listening to all the<br>speakers today<br>um<br>margaret probably the<br>key thing in terms of the hub i'm in is<br>is there science or is there science<br>fiction<br>and that's from a cultural perspective a<br>cultural view and i think lorraine<br>elaborated that too<br>because that that perception or that<br>window from a cultural<br>perspective needs to be explored<br>um<br>probably the hidden truth that needs to<br>be unraveled<br>for<br>the relationship in a sense for it to be<br>culturally<br>purposeful or focused<br>is<br>a cooperation to understand to draw a<br>picture perfect or imperfect<br>and be responsible for what we find<br>i think that's where maori needs to be<br>taken to<br>and alongside every everybody because<br>the the science<br>at a degree is at a distance was<br>but if it's brought into our corner and<br>to our forums<br>we're we're great to participate<br>and i think that<br>the world of science is another<br>career<br>it's been an opportunity and and within<br>you of we've<br>explored it through internships with<br>maori graduates<br>we really need that succession plan to<br>be educated within the education system<br>and for me<br>um<br>i'm<br>more<br>forthright and saying that we now have<br>kuda kaupapa we've had children that<br>have gone through many stages of phases<br>of learning<br>and then we try and provide them with a<br>maori world view and opportunity to<br>what's left<br>to now visibly bring science into that<br>opportunity within the within<br>organizations like cris<br>within major corporations and and<br>especially within the universities<br>probably that would be my closing point<br>kia ora um<br>i completely agree with you uh<br>nick t<br>and<br>this is why um as a university and i've<br>been involved in this um quite heavily<br>myself we've developed this bachelor of<br>climate change which has a very very<br>strong thread<br>of um<br>maori<br>and indigenous<br>perspectives so it has science or you<br>know western science but it also has<br>indigenous world views<br>and since since i moved back it sort of<br>started to happen in australia but it's<br>become really clear to me that we need<br>to have a meeting of minds here<br>where alternative world views including<br>tao maori i think super super important<br>not only here but for the world to think<br>of kaitiakitanga as a guiding principle<br>for climate change<br>addressing our climate change problems<br>so actually i'll just put a little um<br>nod towards the panel tomorrow at one<br>o'clock which will be addressing<br>issues around gender<br>um and<br>indigenous world views with climate<br>change so i think that's going to be a<br>super interesting panel um but i'm right<br>on board this needs to happen and and we<br>should do it here in waikato in aotearoa<br>because we can because we should and<br>it's right it's the right thing to do<br>um<br>and now i'm going to stop talking i'm<br>going to hand over to louie if he has<br>any final comments he wants to make<br>yeah kyota margaret thank you i totally<br>agree with the speakers beforehand and<br>i've learned a lot with this panel thank<br>you<br>um<br>while we say that we kind of know that<br>climate change is occurring and we know<br>the major drivers we now need to start<br>obviously focusing on solutions<br>and we know less about those to be<br>honest and<br>we'd like to think we know more but it's<br>not just about science it's about all of<br>what the previous speakers are talking<br>about and integration<br>across cultural and social and economic<br>boundaries to be able to make it<br>we need to probably do<br>and learn more<br>about a whole variety of different areas<br>because it won't be a simple solution<br>that helps us<br>meet the kind of goals that we set<br>ourselves whether they're biophysical<br>cultural social or economic<br>so there are a lot of different areas<br>that we need to bring people in we need<br>to bring in this enormous diversity of<br>thinking right different peoples uh many<br>different voices because it isn't going<br>to be just one or two people or just us<br>that solves us but lots of little bits<br>where we work together and personal<br>decisions that we make about how we are<br>going to get to work tomorrow what we're<br>going to eat in the way that we're going<br>to live and the way that we raise our<br>kids right and we respect the past and<br>the land<br>fantastic and and thank you so much i've<br>got goosebumps just from what an amazing<br>um a lot of energy we have um in the<br>sense that<br>you know you're all puzzle pieces um of<br>the waikato um and and so are our<br>viewers um when they get the chance to<br>watch this and all the panels that are<br>to come so i want to i want to put out a<br>call to action to to those that are<br>going to watch this to say please watch<br>the other panels um when you see locals<br>uh here in the wake up tour that you<br>want to connect with<br>go and take the plunge and reach out to<br>them um to talk about this kind of stuff<br>more and and keep up skilling wherever<br>you can so that you can see what your<br>place and all of this will be i think<br>we've had a great example today of<br>thinking<br>globally and and how everything links<br>together but it the only way that we are<br>part of the solution is to act locally<br>and in the rain's um<br>terms as well now like really really<br>soon so let's commit to doing those<br>things really really soon<br>thank you everyone<br>the university of waikato is proud to<br>introduce the world's first bachelor of<br>climate change for the people who know<br>there is no planet b<br>gain the skills needed for the jobs of<br>tomorrow contribute to a fundamental<br>shift in the way we do business and go<br>about our lives<br>explore how ma tauranga maori can bring<br>perspective to the most pressing issue<br>of our time<br>apply now and carve a career where<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
