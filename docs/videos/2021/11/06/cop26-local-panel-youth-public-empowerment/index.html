to and are sitting on today<br>so welcome everybody<br>i'm heidi martin and i'm one of the<br>panelists of this ropu and we've been<br>invited to share our different thoughts<br>and perspectives on the topic of youth<br>and public<br>or community empowerment<br>and<br>we can all see and hear the really<br>strong calls can't we calls for change<br>that are coming from rangatahi and young<br>people<br>all across our country and all around<br>the world right now<br>and we also know that there are many<br>people and communities and and groups of<br>all ages who've been working in<br>empowered ways to create<br>a more healthy sustainable<br>world for for a long time<br>so<br>this panel is here to share thoughts and<br>ideas about that and and also how do we<br>harness the experience of this rising<br>energy and we're going to hear from um<br>from each of us about that so i'm making<br>to the wisdom and experiences of this<br>group there are six of us here today and<br>um and one in a pre-recorded video<br>and we're going to go around each<br>panelist<br>and to share and each panelist will pass<br>to the next one<br>and then if we have time for an open<br>quarter or end then we will do that as<br>well<br>so um<br>and i'd like to hand over to hannah<br>rafferty<br>parliament<br>um hello everyone<br>my name is<br>han<br>i'm 19 years old and i don't have a<br>flash phd degree none of that i'm<br>literally just a girl from huntley and<br>nakano<br>and so i'm really privileged to be on<br>this<br>talk and this around in this space today<br>and around um the topic of youth and<br>public engagement um i'll start off with<br>this<br>quoted or that was an article and it was<br>someone who said that they're really<br>concerned<br>around the behavior<br>and<br>the<br>acts of youth today<br>but that article was actually written in<br>1640 by a governor general so that's how<br>long and that's how much um<br>i guess all it will always be the youth<br>that are at the front line of wanting<br>change and wanting<br>um to have it better or wanting to<br>um it's never going to stop the youth<br>the youth are never going to stop so<br>um a bit of background uh around about<br>myself and youth space um i think i<br>don't want to talk about myself either<br>the first<br>um<br>um<br>so<br>something you could say is this<br>this um space and this corridor is like<br>the first talk of today<br>title can be quite a low energy phase so<br>if my<br>wi-fi cuts out that's tedious telling me<br>to shush<br>so um<br>really um<br>i'll talk about a little call it all<br>about<br>youth i guess i don't know how to put<br>this but<br>to me is kendrick lamar<br>but in<br>um<br>last bit this year we<br>and the quarter of maori woods the<br>kaupapa of maori awards i went with my<br>grandfather taitamu to support him<br>but i was actually just his driver<br>i was i don't even think he was invited<br>to the huey you know we this was about<br>um<br>uh standing up for maori wolves<br>he wasn't invited i wasn't invited i<br>just happened to be the driver at the<br>end of the day i ended up speaking on<br>behalf of um<br>my own fakado about how it was so<br>um important that we have a maori voice<br>at this table<br>and this<br>guy<br>his name was wilson and i always talk<br>about this guy who i have a lot of<br>respect for you and wilson and he<br>questioned me on what is mana motoki<br>to me is knowing the assets that you<br>already have that aren't materialistic<br>and that is knowing that i've got te reo<br>maori<br>i've got a kuda i'm able to train every<br>day and i have a huge madakai and those<br>are things that aren't uh materialistic<br>but they're our own mana motuhaki assets<br>that he won't be able to do so yes i can<br>read write and do<br>two plus two maths but we we can also<br>navigate the tides we can also read the<br>phases of the moon and we can also tell<br>the star navigations throughout the sky<br>and that's something that this new<br>generation<br>through<br>um<br>decolonization<br>of going through sarikura and having the<br>likes of matsuahutu<br>shane fighting for our indigenous<br>knowledge through youth<br>and<br>after that the second hui that we were<br>probably invited to again<br>is that um<br>ewan actually came up to me and he's<br>gone on to his own journey of learning<br>his culture and<br>maori and it's not about maori want to<br>be here we want to be in front of the<br>line look at me look at me it's not<br>about that it's about understanding that<br>we can work work walk<br>and work<br>in both worlds i have an arm and a leg<br>in the side and i have a arm the leg on<br>the side and they both work perfectly<br>balanced together and that's what i<br>think that our<br>generation<br>particularly going through<br>are able to do and now that we have<br>maths cars but then we also can go down<br>that's all i have to say don't want to<br>talk too long<br>and i'll give the dark over to you<br>hannah<br>for your um<br>um<br>kia ora everyone my name is hannah hagen<br>i'm from scotland and the east coast of<br>aotearoa<br>i'm 17 years old and i've just finished<br>my first year here at the university of<br>waikato<br>doing a bachelor of social sciences<br>majoring in political science and maori<br>and indigenous studies<br>i work for goico waikoto's environment<br>center as a climate organizer and i'm<br>also involved in<br>several regional climate action projects<br>most predominantly i'm co-chair of<br>rangatahi voices a regional organization<br>that empowers youth to share their<br>voices on the issues that matter to them<br>i'm passionate about creating a safe<br>climate future for everyone and i<br>believe we can do this<br>by challenging the status quo through<br>transformative and creative collective<br>action<br>i'm really excited to be here today to<br>discuss the importance of youth within<br>um and our disabled whanau<br>um<br>i'd like to begin by discussing the<br>thing that often comes up for me when<br>i'm navigating these spaces in the<br>climate action as a young person<br>and it's often that i'm perplexed by the<br>division<br>climate change creates between<br>generations<br>because in my understanding there are<br>only few things that are shared amongst<br>all of humanity that something that<br>everyone can relate to and i believe<br>that we're lucky enough that<br>youthfulness is one of those things that<br>and it's something that every human<br>begins with something that we can all<br>share all understand and all relate to<br>yet it is creating<br>this climate change creates this<br>divisions between generations and<br>i believe that means that we are missing<br>out on the value of young people we're<br>missing out on the value of young people<br>when we are dismissing them tokenizing<br>them or<br>dividing ourselves<br>because within the context of the<br>climate crisis<br>can teach us where to go because we have<br>the ability to question critique and<br>analyze the world around us<br>and this is what we're seeing around the<br>world young people are rising up for<br>climate justice because we are using our<br>young eyes to see the injustice of<br>climate change but also the opportunity<br>it poses for a better future for our<br>future<br>um<br>i'd also like to note that<br>what i'm talking about and what we all<br>talk about is already understood within<br>the cultural value of whakapapa<br>whakapapa already encapsulates the<br>importance of empowering young people<br>and the connection between generations<br>this concept understands that we are<br>nothing without each other and without<br>young people there is nothing that can<br>be passed on<br>whakapapa also enables us to look back<br>into the past and into the future so we<br>can<br>look back to see the young people who<br>have become old and then what they have<br>passed on and we are able to see the<br>future through ourselves and what we<br>want to pass on as<br>as we grow older um<br>so yeah i think i'll stop here i'm<br>looking forward to exploring those ideas<br>a bit more later and more of a group<br>corridor those are just some of my<br>initial um<br>that's from my initial coordinator on<br>facado and i'm looking really looking<br>forward to hearing everyone else's<br>and i'll pass it on to the next person<br>kyoda<br>hello everyone<br>um my name is shalini i am a scholar<br>under the zener dash fellowship in<br>sustainable development at university of<br>waikato<br>um my research looks at the conditions<br>and factors that create active<br>um<br>and engage young citizens<br>particularly the kind of sustainable<br>citizens that are needed as we face<br>the threats of climate change<br>um this was important to me especially<br>as i come from the maldives a small<br>island developing state<br>um which is a group of countries that<br>are at most risk<br>to the effects of climate change<br>just to give you uh some information<br>about maldives um it is a country<br>of approximately 1190<br>islands in the indian ocean with a<br>population of slightly over 400<br>000 people<br>um just to highlight the vulnerability<br>of the country uh only one percent of<br>the geographical area<br>is land as the islands are so small<br>um the smallness of the islands me also<br>means that housing and all the critical<br>infrastructure<br>are within about 100 meters of the ocean<br>they are also quite flat with a majority<br>over eighty hundred eighty percent of<br>the islands<br>um being in fact<br>less than one meter above sea level<br>um the most<br>recent natural disaster uh the most<br>extreme natural disaster maldives<br>experienced in recent history was the<br>indian ocean tsunami<br>which impacted the whole country<br>and also<br>the islands that were most affected<br>needed resettlement<br>currently<br>a mixture of human and natural factors<br>impact<br>the islands<br>for example one of the biggest<br>challenges we face is sand erosion as a<br>result we are losing a lot of our land<br>particularly because of development<br>practices such as land reclamation to<br>increase the size of the islands and<br>also<br>building of harbors which destroy a lot<br>of<br>the reefs which is the natural<br>so even though sand erosion is a natural<br>process these kinds of<br>human-made<br>practices are<br>impacting the natural flow of erosion<br>and making us lose more sand<br>more land than we would um naturally<br>would<br>um<br>as we all know in maldives and also<br>elsewhere um<br>sustainable development is hard to<br>achieve<br>when there are forces conflicting forces<br>against it<br>particularly business interests that are<br>well funded with<br>you know well access to decision making<br>as a result environmental activism in<br>recent times have become political<br>and also because particularly the<br>younger generation are much more<br>concerned about the adverse effects<br>sport<br>that are happening now as well as that<br>what would happen in the future<br>um however more of such informed and<br>concerned citizenry<br>are needed<br>to be<br>active as<br>they are standing up to those who are<br>who have more power relatively<br>um<br>i feel like there needs to be two things<br>that are that should be happening<br>concurrently<br>firstly there needs to be more pressure<br>put upon politicians and decision makers<br>to meet their environmental commitments<br>and secondly there needs to be more<br>opportunities and support<br>created to foster the kind of citizens<br>that demand such change<br>the purpose of my research<br>was to look at<br>environmentally<br>engaged active<br>uh young citizens<br>um to see what were the kind of factors<br>and experiences that motivated them in<br>their<br>activism<br>so that<br>those kinds of factors could be<br>highlighted<br>um and promoted<br>to create<br>those kinds of<br>young activists<br>um<br>i<br>just<br>to summarize um exposure to natural<br>environments<br>played a great part in young people<br>appreciating nature<br>um getting to know the importance and<br>impact of nature to their everyday lives<br>unfortunately our increasingly urban<br>lifestyles and urban migration<br>is affecting much of these um<br>interactions uh and viewing nature is<br>something other than or something<br>separate<br>from us<br>but as effects of<br>environmental degradation is showing us<br>and particularly as uh indigenous<br>activists have been saying throughout<br>this is clearly not the case<br>and it is not feasible to think so<br>um<br>another factor that<br>was highlighted was the um importance of<br>role models<br>and access to networks<br>um<br>fortunately with the advent of social<br>media and connecting people<br>across um<br>different countries was quite<br>advantageous especially to maldivian<br>activists as well<br>um<br>because it created a unified course even<br>though they were being active locally<br>um<br>seeing other young people being active<br>is inspiring<br>um it also um shows them<br>that even though they are young they<br>also um<br>have a voice and they also have a role<br>um<br>and also access to such networks gives<br>them<br>information and support networks support<br>networks are being increasingly<br>important because<br>climate<br>anxiety is a real thing<br>and<br>a lot of the young people that i spoke<br>to were impacted emotionally impacted by<br>the stress of thinking about their<br>futures<br>um spaces where alternative views on<br>development and sustainability what<br>development means<br>was very important<br>because<br>just to counter the mainstream<br>growth<br>emphasized<br>view of<br>development<br>this was<br>facilitated facilitated by schools<br>universities ngos sometimes local<br>councils<br>um of course these spaces needs to be<br>genuine and not just<br>tokenistic and genuinely equipped<br>with giving young people factual<br>information<br>as we know information is now kind of a<br>weapon<br>because there's so much needed to<br>counter the kind of um<br>lies that are propagated<br>um<br>currently<br>and also these kinds of spaces needs to<br>be needs to generally give young people<br>an opportunity to have their say<br>um in the decision<br>in industrial industries that are being<br>made particularly in the case of you<br>know local planning<br>or development planning nationally or at<br>local level<br>um<br>young people being active in<br>environmental courses is not new um they<br>have been<br>vocal in such causes within their<br>respective localities<br>and also speaking out in different<br>global platforms for decades<br>the difference now is the unified nature<br>of the current movement<br>assisted once again by the modern<br>communication technologies<br>with young people from different<br>backgrounds<br>different ethnicities<br>and a more inclusive nature of this<br>movement of course<br>more<br>work needs to be done still<br>to be more inclusive particularly in the<br>case of marginalized groups of<br>indigenous groups of groups from the<br>what we're known as the global south<br>and also the important<br>thing is not to write them off as a<br>trend<br>um<br>and take what they're saying<br>seriously because as a matter of fact<br>they're much more informed and committed<br>than some of the leaders today<br>um<br>and much more well-meaning as well and<br>much<br>they have much more to lose literally um<br>and speaking of leaders and also not to<br>and treat them as some people who are in<br>training<br>because they are the leaders of today um<br>because the kind of change<br>um<br>is to um<br>it's important to avoid or minimize<br>um the adverse effects of what is going<br>to happen not just what is going to<br>happen in the future but what people are<br>experiencing<br>today<br>because it is happening right now<br>so<br>okay<br>when i was working in a youth court<br>space the judge at the time um used that<br>framework to discuss this construct of<br>the the old net being cast aside and the<br>new<br>um and the new thinking of our young<br>people because we know that<br>most young people are impacted by<br>systems that technically they they<br>haven't created or they haven't been a<br>part of them one is local democracy so<br>i'm sharing today i guess as a gisborne<br>district councilor who um who has seen<br>uh change happen in regards to those who<br>have come to the tables of governance<br>because as we know these are spaces that<br>talk a lot about infrastructure uh parks<br>reserves um sports a whole range of of<br>constructs that really impact young<br>people<br>and and the involvement in their<br>communities uh much of my life was spent<br>working with our young people in<br>paraffinity and it was a privilege and<br>an honor to serve them um in that space<br>and i you know i really respect uh the<br>opportunity i get to talk with young<br>people<br>so as a local governor one of the things<br>that you notice in respect to um<br>being at council tables is that they<br>were often made up of on my councils<br>particularly at the starting of my<br>career in this space the average age of<br>a district council was 68. and so um<br>that had been kind of the rhetoric and<br>the known facts for for the whole of<br>councils throughout new zealand so i did<br>set about in my task to how do i get<br>young people uh empowered or have access<br>to that decision-making table so one of<br>the frameworks was to work towards<br>having a local gusman district youth<br>council which i was very passionate<br>about but and again one of the<br>constructs that a number of our young<br>people cured it to you for your poorer<br>today have talked about is this<br>intergenerational shifting and i love<br>hana how you talk about the mataranga<br>and the marumataka all the things that<br>technically in my time life i didn't get<br>i didn't get the benefits and the<br>bonuses of knowing that at all based on<br>my upbringing and and i and i've had to<br>fight some anger some sadness and all<br>that to get to a point now where i<br>embrace all i learn from those ranked<br>who are learning through papa so kia ora<br>to you hannah to you henna too i just<br>love that you said something um oh sorry<br>hannah you discussed that your<br>generation walks between the worlds<br>better probably than other generations<br>have uh based on your truth and your<br>pride and your mana and i just really<br>love that and hannah you talked to about<br>um<br>generations and whakapapa too and that's<br>that that gives you the impetus to think<br>about because from a maori perspective<br>we do think about our tupuna and<br>you don't escape that framework as maori<br>and it's a cultural construct that i<br>respect wholly having not been raised in<br>it so how do i empower young people well<br>everyone has a story and i'm a<br>passionate narrator of stories and<br>listening of stories and the collector<br>of stories and so in my time with local<br>government i realized we make decisions<br>to build and make things but we don't<br>often ask the young people that we're<br>making them for if this is what they<br>want<br>so we don't generally<br>we do an engagement space when we go out<br>into communities but unless you are<br>connected to young people unless you're<br>someone that young people would like to<br>talk to because you have a rapport on it<br>you generally don't get them at those<br>tables um i've done a number of uh<br>wonderful uh kind of impact projects in<br>my region where i have gone and talked<br>with young people not at them or to them<br>but with them to understand what their<br>needs are in my region um so fighting<br>for a youth council was fascinating in<br>that debate uh because i did have a<br>generation say oh we don't need young<br>people old people you know they were<br>really anti groups and i was like we are<br>this is a group so i think um<br>intergenerationally why we desperately<br>need to empower our young people uh to<br>have them participate is because simply<br>they will inherit all the decisions that<br>we make and it's a it's a vital<br>impacting uh kind of resource to have if<br>we've got young people right there<br>saying oh<br>actually did you think about this have<br>you thought about these things so i<br>really value young people's thoughts<br>because i think outside the box they<br>think literally they just think in in<br>such dynamic ways and i always remind<br>older people you were young once<br>and i think some old people forget that<br>and they get stuck and so young people<br>remind us that in our youth what were we<br>passionate about and i think for me as a<br>local governor uh in my council<br>i just really want to see more young<br>people have access to the decision<br>making tables and and having the freedom<br>to come and speak their views and their<br>thoughts i really want them to<br>participate in democracy because i value<br>their citizenship and i think we<br>shouldn't just value you when you turn<br>18 then you can vote it's actually about<br>valuing you from the time you arrive on<br>the planet and actually seeing your<br>future right from the get-go um you know<br>you know i value that i want to protect<br>young people's voices because often they<br>have got people where they say as to you<br>don't know you don't understand natural<br>fact you know more and you understand<br>more than a lot of people give you<br>credit for and those partnerships with<br>you are really about us understanding<br>that your voice um whilst they're still<br>trying to figure out things and trying<br>to work it out because you're still<br>growing up and still developing your<br>critical thinking that we value it that<br>we say thank you you know because<br>because i think we need to spend more<br>time and wanna<br>intergenerationally figuring out what we<br>can do together i'm all about<br>participation in the common unity of the<br>community and my framework is around my<br>story<br>as a young person growing up in a very<br>poor neighborhood um being able to<br>achieve the things i've done because<br>people believed in me and i think it's<br>our role as adults to believe in you<br>because you carry a a new world<br>unfortunately that's been damaged but i<br>believe in the future and the hope<br>is held with our young people and<br>communities of interest that have um<br>and constructs that are going back to<br>old times old learnings that actually<br>are new to some<br>but they weren't<br>so for me today i just want to say i<br>just really embrace uh the chord all<br>we're having today and i'm a freedom<br>writer so i'm all about collecting<br>stories writing those down for change<br>and um making a difference not just<br>words uh but actions because we need<br>action now and we need it now so uh kia<br>ora to your and thank you for the<br>opportunity to share i hope i can keep<br>it's great to be here um and listening<br>to our young people i used to be young<br>once<br>but now it's good to have meredith<br>remind me about that<br>but um<br>in saying all of this so listening to<br>hannah<br>and hannah and their quarterly about you<br>know<br>the things that they do there's a few<br>things that<br>i suppose has been a battle<br>for us as<br>indigenous people<br>over the years is is<br>the value of the knowledge of our<br>ancestors<br>and so to hear uh<br>hannah talk about what papa and to<br>hear hana rafiti talk about<br>you know mara mataka and all those<br>things that actually quite<br>strong and powerful<br>aspects of<br>the world of our ancestors<br>made me think that<br>probably one of the<br>roles that i have found myself in over<br>the years has been to try and<br>uh<br>re-establish and reignite some of that<br>old<br>knowledge of our ancestors and to<br>validate it because a lot of the time<br>over the years if we look at the kinds<br>of<br>uh corduroy that i remember growing up<br>with around the way our ancestors came<br>to<br>altea how they got here by accident and<br>they were just lucky that you know they<br>had their<br>animals and some plants and they were on<br>a fishing trip and they got blown off<br>course and this happened to land in<br>aotearoa<br>and and the sad part about it is that<br>what starts to happen is that<br>it becomes a general view<br>that<br>an indigenous way of looking at your<br>world<br>uh<br>isn't actually<br>worth anything because uh all it it it<br>only comes from a realm of myth and<br>legend<br>so we've got to have what we have to do<br>is try and do all the stuff and<br>and<br>i guess i have this term that i can<br>demystify is to pull all of this stuff<br>out of the realm of myth and legend and<br>utilize it<br>and so<br>a lot of the<br>stuff that we do i do a lot of things on<br>waka with young people<br>um<br>we sail we teach them about<br>how to navigate a canoe over<br>hundreds thousands of miles of ocean<br>how to read all the signs of nature how<br>to understand<br>the things that our ancestors understood<br>centuries ago when they when they made<br>their journeys to aotearoa<br>but on top of that was all the other<br>kind of stuff that comes with how to<br>take care of and how to look after<br>their world<br>and<br>one of the big things that we do on our<br>waka is that we try our best to<br>encourage young people to understand<br>that<br>when we are on a canoe<br>with about 15 or 16 of us sailing from<br>one island to another we might be in the<br>ocean for three or four weeks<br>um that waka in that space becomes our<br>island<br>and so we have to do everything on board<br>on that little island for the next few<br>weeks<br>that ensures our survival<br>so we have to look after everything we<br>have to take care of everything we have<br>to understand the things we need to do<br>to do all of this kind of stuff<br>and then the big job<br>is to get people to<br>transfer that knowledge to how they take<br>care of things on the land and where<br>does that all come from it comes from<br>the talk of our ancestors it comes from<br>the talk of great people and i think the<br>other thing that we all forget about<br>is that when our tibuna<br>of this is my belief when our two<br>brothers jumped on our walker to sell to<br>aotearoa they were all young you know<br>they weren't old guys like me they were<br>young people<br>and uh<br>and why because what i've seen in the<br>young people that i know<br>is that<br>they'll do stuff that old people get a<br>little bit nervous about doing these<br>things<br>you know young people will sit there and<br>go well let's try that in<br>and then they'll try it and it works and<br>then if it doesn't work because i've<br>seen it then they come over and haven't<br>talked to me and saying we tried this it<br>didn't work have you got any ideas and i<br>said yeah try it this way it might work<br>it might not work but the best thing is<br>for you to try it out<br>and then what happens is that<br>the kind of tools<br>and the knowledge and the materanga that<br>they acquire in this journey gets them<br>to a point where they're a bit like me<br>or a bit like meredith or bit like shane<br>you know that you have all your<br>uh<br>reality has been shaped by a lot of<br>other people but it's been shaped in a<br>way that hopefully<br>those people who've helped shape you<br>have allowed you to do the kind of<br>things that have allowed you to grow<br>instead of trying to confine you to a<br>specific way of looking at something<br>you know and i have a great time i like<br>hanging out with young people because i<br>learn heaps you know i learn heaps from<br>young people about all kinds of<br>different things<br>and but when they come and hang out with<br>me i hope they learn some stuff too<br>because you know we sit and we have a<br>bit of a talk and about all kinds of<br>things<br>um<br>but at the end of the day<br>you know i'm sitting here in my house<br>looking out and we've got a big garden<br>and what we've started doing with lots<br>of our young people is putting gardens<br>all around the place<br>and um i'm into what hana was saying you<br>know we look at our calendar we go wow<br>this is a bit of a low energy day let's<br>just chill out we won't do any gardening<br>work today but we won't do this and then<br>and what we're starting to find is that<br>that<br>knowledge<br>that once was relegated into the<br>background because it was our knowledge<br>it's starting to become the kind of<br>knowledge that young people are trying<br>to look for again and<br>utilize<br>in<br>their<br>path to understanding what's going on in<br>this world because they're going to<br>become the old people like us<br>later<br>and i guess one of our big jobs as older<br>people<br>is to<br>leave this world as good ancestors you<br>know i'm pretty careful maybe in about<br>50 or 100 years time when some young<br>person is going to say something nice<br>about me because we tried hard<br>to encourage our rangatahi<br>to do the right stuff to make big<br>uh<br>big call<br>when it comes to looking after our<br>planet to make big calls when it comes<br>to looking after our ocean and make big<br>calls when it comes to looking after our<br>people<br>so i really enjoyed sitting and<br>listening to our young people today<br>because uh<br>the world's in their hands you know like<br>i said i've had my time<br>um i i just like having discussions with<br>them going for sales with young people<br>i've got a young crew you know not i've<br>got<br>people who can navigate who can be in<br>charge of a waka and then they<br>like<br>i think the oldest ones like 25 or 26<br>and and they're all in and they've been<br>doing stuff with me since they've been<br>little kids and i just leave them to it<br>because they know what they're doing<br>they're really good at it<br>and uh<br>they've added a lot more to what i've<br>been able to show them and uh<br>good luck to our rangatahi and it's<br>great to just be sitting here listening<br>at road street here in hamilton<br>listening to the korero today i've been<br>really inspired um and i just want to<br>acknowledge um<br>celine from the maldives her story<br>um a powerful story and a real one<br>that's happening um also to hannah and<br>hannah listening to you and your your<br>passion and your drive it gives me<br>encouragement that we've got rangatahi<br>that are on the right path<br>uh meredith your your leadership um and<br>establishing youth councils on that is<br>what we need across<br>to continue this conversation<br>and i'm looking forward to listening to<br>what heidi has to say when she um<br>finishes this<br>from my perspective there's one thing<br>i've learned working with children and<br>i'm talking from the age of about three<br>and a half through two to twelve years<br>of age over the last 40 plus years and<br>having five more of my own is that um<br>the one thing that we as as older people<br>can do<br>is always you know when a young person<br>asks a question is to respond with the<br>answer why not let's try that<br>um because once we open that up<br>our young people have far more creative<br>minds that we once had when we were<br>young and they're able to impart that<br>knowledge on us and i'll give you a<br>brief example we were visiting<br>mangatoturi ecological island which is a<br>42 kilometer pest-proof fenced inland<br>island just south of hamilton city um in<br>mangatoturi south of cambridge<br>and on the trip back one of my students<br>said to me<br>why do we have to travel all this way to<br>see<br>um from our tale maori our maori world<br>view to see the uh the mother<br>and to see our native bush<br>and um<br>why can't we have our own it still was<br>the question<br>and my answer was<br>why not<br>well<br>six years later we now have an<br>ecological island on the back of this<br>cuda<br>which used to be a rugby field which is<br>quite sacrilege in new zealand you<br>turned a rugby field into an island<br>then you built a pest-proof fence around<br>it<br>and you left it for the next couple of<br>years and what's happened on that island<br>is what's happening in all ecological<br>spaces like that is it's returned back<br>to its natural form because we've<br>planted over 10 000 native trees and<br>plants into that space<br>and now the students have a resource<br>that was their idea that they created<br>and generationally those students who<br>started that island have now left but<br>those who are there now are learning<br>from what<br>the vision was from those younger<br>students<br>and it's the it's a world first no one<br>else has ever done that that wouldn't<br>have happened if we didn't have the<br>support of organizations like enviro<br>schools funded throughout our regional<br>councils if enviro schools didn't exist<br>we wouldn't have had the support and the<br>learning that as adults a lot of us<br>needed to upskill meredith talked about<br>how she missed out in her education<br>we grow<br>our communities by<br>having the resources and the people that<br>drive it and our youth are the ones that<br>should direct it<br>if that it is their idea and they want<br>to make it happen it will happen<br>so if we talk about climate change and<br>we talk about the impact of<br>rising sea levels and the impact it's<br>having on islands i go back to um<br>what he said as maori as our ancestors<br>we were on an island we looked out we<br>were getting overcrowded our resources<br>were running out what did we do we<br>upskilled ourselves with the knowledge<br>of navigation of what to put on our waka<br>to survive<br>and and taking the plants with us that<br>we could grow when we arrived so that we<br>could be sustainable and we just went<br>there<br>and that took a lot of courage and we<br>were young our ancestors were young when<br>they did that it was out of necessity<br>that they had to do something<br>our youth today<br>are not just talking about it they're<br>actually doing it and they're doing it<br>in a groundswell which um<br>one of our speakers spoke about the<br>power of social media being able to<br>activate and inspire and encourage<br>others to actually take a stand and do<br>something about it i remember in 1981 i<br>walked on the springbok um anti-racist<br>tours as a young person i walked in<br>hamilton i walked in wellington and i<br>walked in christchurch i was 18 years<br>old and i thought why am i doing this<br>and i was doing it because i believed in<br>it i thought that my participation would<br>make a difference and it did a very<br>small part but collectively a huge<br>impact on what happened in south africa<br>years later with nelson mandela and that<br>comes back to and he acknowledged that<br>in new zealand we were doing that for<br>the rest of the world<br>we've done it with our nuclear free<br>stance right and we need to step up with<br>the voice of our youth to do it from now<br>for our to reduce the greenhouse<br>emissions to look at how we're going to<br>tackle this this problem so i i want to<br>afi and<br>hana or<br>today because what they've said is the<br>most powerful thing that could come out<br>of this conversation from youth around<br>community you can't do it on your own<br>but we must listen to you and<br>capture your voice and move forward and<br>support you with the resources that you<br>need to be able to lead this as you are<br>now<br>so much of what everybody is saying is<br>resonating with me it's quite good going<br>last because um you get to hear<br>everybody's passion and ideas um<br>i'm from a group called toymata<br>foundation and we're<br>we're a community group and we're in<br>partnership with another community group<br>called<br>uh called um temorito and together we we<br>designed and developed these two<br>programs enviro schools and te hotudo<br>and we've been doing this for about 20<br>years we started this maybe 25 years ago<br>and uh when we were all pretty young<br>and we wanted to transform the education<br>system<br>well i think we are transforming it in<br>in some ways you know the many people<br>involved now because um<br>i guess what we felt and and what we<br>still feel is that um you know we hear a<br>lot of calls for for education that that<br>we need education to to solve all these<br>different environmental issues to make<br>people more aware<br>but the kind of education that was<br>happening around that was was still very<br>much about the mind you know like we<br>just don't think we're going to think<br>our way out of this this is not a thing<br>we're going to think our way out of and<br>the kind of education that we<br>are working for and that our kaupapa is<br>is about<br>education as a it's got to be an<br>exciting learning journey<br>it's got to be a journey of deep<br>experiences that touch our hearts<br>and<br>and that enable us to feel<br>interconnected and that really energize<br>us and rise you know make our energy<br>rise and i can see that and i can feel<br>that when i listen to you hanaraphatsi<br>and you hannah you know you're you're<br>full of rising energy um that actually<br>is<br>that's what's going to change the<br>situation<br>it's it's not the amount of knowledge we<br>can stuff into our brains is it it's the<br>um<br>it's that deep deep connection that we<br>can have of knowing that um that we<br>belong to the land and that the land<br>doesn't belong to us of knowing that um<br>of knowing<br>the essence of ourselves as well you<br>something you said that you said<br>straight up hannah about um<br>tahaki and the and the<br>the um the assets that you have you know<br>i think we've got a real challenge in<br>education<br>at the moment to um to really nurture<br>the whole the whole child and the whole<br>young person through education and that<br>and that<br>part of the learning journey is for<br>young people and for all of us to really<br>understand what are the gifts and the<br>skills that we bring that are the<br>essence of us that we can contribute to<br>this<br>healthy sustainable world and that's<br>what's so exciting about what so many<br>young people are doing now because it<br>feels like you really are in touch with<br>your gifts<br>you you you know what you're passionate<br>about you know what you want to<br>contribute and that is so fantastic and<br>it's so needed<br>um i think some of the other things that<br>we that we that is a challenge in what<br>we call education is that um we're often<br>focusing on a whole lot of problems<br>and<br>as we know you know there's no there's<br>no<br>no end of of kind of problems or you<br>know we've got climate change and<br>biodiversity and water and but but all<br>of those<br>um<br>from a from a a motivation perspective<br>are it's depressing and and as jalen he<br>said you know eco anxiety is a thing so<br>we think that all education needs to<br>have a really positive and creative<br>focus<br>and that<br>the focus is about living to create<br>whole order<br>i mean that really is the is the mission<br>creating high order and well-being for<br>all living things<br>um and then all those all those um<br>all those issues all those problems<br>would actually go away<br>because high water and wellness is what<br>we what we are born for what we are<br>we're born healthy and vibrant and um so<br>we have the we have the knowledge in our<br>beings in our bodies and in nature to<br>actually be that<br>so<br>having education having you know i think<br>um<br>schools and other learning opportunities<br>other learning places where young people<br>are need to<br>um allow young people to really explore<br>their environment be immersed in nature<br>and<br>and to<br>take action on things that really are<br>meaningful for them<br>experiencing making change<br>um will carry it will carry on right<br>throughout life won't it<br>when i look at the people at you know<br>the older people at the cop 26 and and<br>they're all<br>they're all just talking talking talking<br>i don't know that they've got the skills<br>to actually listen to each other<br>empathize<br>um<br>not like it not like the young people<br>have now you know you guys really do<br>seem to know how to empathize um with a<br>range a diversity of ideas<br>and to you know the challenges for us to<br>weave those together isn't it into that<br>into that<br>that world of well-being that we're<br>so i'm pretty excited when i hear you<br>know some common threads of this<br>corridor about um intergenerational<br>learning because i<br>and and also have a question about it<br>you know what kind of settings do we<br>need what kind of opportunities do we<br>need to to have more intergenerational<br>learning and action<br>because the old wisdoms<br>and the new innovations<br>and maybe the old wisdom is becoming the<br>new innovations it that something you<br>mentioned torture i think that's true<br>the the old wisdoms of of that of<br>papatsunoku learning from her and<br>learning from people who have observed<br>and lived and been in deep connection<br>with the environment how do we get more<br>especially in a world where a lot of us<br>so just to um<br>i suppose from from<br>an education perspective<br>i believe that<br>what some of us are working for us to is<br>to really change the way we do education<br>from right from the babies<br>uh every single age group has something<br>really unique to offer and um<br>and has<br>uh the ability to make change no matter<br>how young<br>so through embarrassed schools in<br>chiahol tour that's what we're doing and<br>i know that there are many many other<br>groups trying to do this and are doing<br>it as well living sustainably practicing<br>tikanga and um you know we need to<br>connect it all up don't we<br>so i'd be interested to um we have uh<br>we have some time now to<br>might just put it back to you hana and<br>hannah to see if there's anything that<br>you would like to do to say to respond<br>to what you've heard and if there are<br>any questions or<br>uh yeah kyoto everyone for um<br>it's hard going at at the start but also<br>quite nice to see what um<br>flows on and what everyone else has to<br>say and um<br>yeah<br>to everyone who how i love how we<br>integrated everyone's core as we went on<br>um<br>i i loved the<br>um<br>about the<br>potential that comes from the connection<br>between the generations through<br>empowering young people we empower<br>everybody and um<br>doing how<br>there is so much knowledge that exists<br>within<br>the<br>um within the world today and that we<br>can just utilize that to create a better<br>future for everyone and um it's for<br>young people us to um recognize that and<br>to bring that forward and to to fight<br>and to be courageous and brave and to um<br>keep fighting for the change that is<br>necessary<br>um<br>i i don't know if i have<br>any questions for everyone<br>it's always like how do we do that how<br>do we achieve that um what's how are we<br>going to support um<br>young people and from my perspective<br>that's<br>moving beyond tokenism to genuinely<br>empower um young people meredith you<br>talked about not talking at or two but<br>with and to genuinely implement that<br>because in the climate action space it's<br>it's<br>currently sitting at tokenism or a box<br>to tech whether you've had the youth<br>voice or not rather than treating us as<br>valuable knowledge holders um<br>so<br>yeah maybe that's a focado i'll put to<br>do you have something that you would<br>like to say to before anybody else<br>speaks<br>um yeah just really<br>inspired by all our ported all that's<br>gone around in the space but more so<br>that<br>usually the young people just sit and<br>watch<br>and watch our old people do<br>don't say anything don't ask questions<br>um<br>to still respect that<br>um way of thinking of our old people<br>just<br>i think we did come to a point and tell<br>maori where we meet we really craved<br>that way of thinking of indigenous<br>knowledge and we needed it to be<br>tangible to be how felt heard<br>talked about not just um<br>monkey do or monkey see monkey do kind<br>making making sure that our indigenous<br>knowledge and one word is called<br>plena<br>to<br>it<br>reminds me of um<br>some projects that you know many of us<br>have probably seen a sort of tour kind<br>of taina type projects where um the role<br>models<br>uh are young people young people are<br>looking to up to their tuakana as the<br>role models<br>and um the role models aren't<br>older people anymore they're they're<br>young<br>so um i guess that's one thing that i<br>would um<br>offer in response to to what you two<br>have just said is that um<br>that's that we can create more spaces<br>for um and more<br>publicity i suppose<br>uh for young role models<br>and um<br>we can actually celebrate young many<br>more young role models there are<br>thousands thousands of amazing uh young<br>leaders<br>that we could be um<br>that we we could be sharing their<br>anybody else like to um<br>follow on from that cordell<br>i don't i i would just like to say that<br>um in the last election we had a<br>by-election and so um our youngest ever<br>district councillor is 28 and so<br>with all due respect to that space<br>changing up the age range but a very um<br>you know qualified highly and my amazing<br>young men stepped into that space and so<br>i think one of the things that those of<br>us who are in spaces that we hold um<br>through a three-year training or<br>election is how much are we<br>making room for our young people to come<br>in and to make a space that's been very<br>much a<br>it's a terrible statement of fact but<br>pale and male but it's um<br>often being stale because it's a system<br>that forgets the joy of of life and<br>goodness and hope with regard to<br>decision making and often the space as<br>young people don't come into to speak up<br>and and have their saying<br>have got a process that's quite boring<br>that's quite um strict that's quite a<br>gendered quite western uh colonial and<br>uh you know old school thinkings whereas<br>with intergenerational corridor means<br>everybody comes to the table and<br>everyone has their say has the<br>opportunity to share their thoughts and<br>everyone gets to do that be loud and<br>robust or with song or with poetry or<br>with whatever prose works and that's<br>what young people bring whenever young<br>people come into the council chambers i<br>just get so excited because it's like<br>yes youthful essence is here so i would<br>just say to you beautiful young people<br>into that wonderful young lady from the<br>mountains that spoke to that we need you<br>to come into those spaces um it takes<br>courage and it does take a bit of bold<br>and brave but if you've got someone in<br>the mix like me for our young people in<br>this region um then we will support you<br>to do that sharing of your voice because<br>as i said when i listen to the rangapai<br>speaking of cop and those young people<br>from those parts of the world that are<br>suffering the loss of their landscape<br>their languages their cultures being<br>challenged right now right now um they<br>don't want a five-year plan they want to<br>now plan and i think their adolescence<br>and it's youthful vigory<br>kind of reminds us that now is the time<br>um you can have your 10-year plans you<br>can have your 30-year plans but right<br>now i'm standing in front of you saying<br>will you help us do this now and so i<br>think it's time for lots of the spaces<br>that young people aren't in to be<br>actually um<br>to move people out to bring youth and<br>and i think sometimes as adults we have<br>to be the people to be bold enough to<br>say let me get out of the way and let<br>you come on in and do your thing because<br>it's going to be magical um that takes<br>courage on both spaces but that<br>intergenerational knowledge should be<br>about how proud we are to share in the<br>spaces we have but pass it on because<br>that's good that's that's about<br>in respective encouraged to say<br>whose voices are coming up now and and<br>how are we supporting them so um killed<br>it to you and as i said i get excited uh<br>when i hear young people speak up but i<br>feel that my role as an adult because we<br>teach young people to speak truth speak<br>your mind then you get to be an adult<br>and we tell you<br>deep down so<br>i'm saying don't keep it down speak your<br>truth be proud of who you are but let's<br>find those spaces that we can open up<br>and invite more of<br>young people when um that's not just<br>token it's not just oh that was lovely<br>they came to see us let's actually make<br>it count uh for change and um like i<br>said much respect to young people i know<br>it's not easy but trust me even at my<br>age it's not easy either<br>um so but yeah i think change is<br>happening i've been singing change going<br>come by sam cook now it's been my theme<br>song but change has to happen now so<br>kyota<br>anyone else like to have any um final<br>no<br>oh well kia ora koto it's um<br>yeah it has been a very interesting<br>corridor and<br>obviously many um<br>common themes around<br>intergenerational connection and<br>indigenous<br>wisdoms and tikanga that are so<br>important now and that are really being<br>valued<br>in<br>in so many spaces<br>um<br>the<br>the call for change and also i know<br>young people are calling for change but<br>they're also making change so you know<br>not sitting around waiting for it not<br>sitting around waiting for governments<br>to make decisions and councils to make<br>decisions but<br>actually doing what needs to be done<br>so many adults are wanting to get in<br>behind that and<br>i think that we have do have a lot of<br>support and a lot of intergenerational<br>connection definitely in our country<br>here so mahita everybody for your fakado<br>uh mahita you hana rafiti and hana and<br>hannah and<br>charlini as well for<br>for everything that you're doing in this<br>space and the leadership that and the<br>role models that you are for other young<br>people and for adults as well<br>and to all of our older generations too<br>and the experiences that we're bringing<br>into these spaces and uh and the<br>learning adventures that we're all on<br>and the many things we all still have to<br>learn<br>so i will hand over to shane now to uh<br>we have come to an awareness the<br>challenge lies before us let us work<br>together as one<br>stay well so that we may have the<br>ability to manage success
