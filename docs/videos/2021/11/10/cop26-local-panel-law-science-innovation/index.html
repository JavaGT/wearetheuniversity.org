uh<br>really what we want to touch on is a<br>combination of issues around<br>law innovation<br>and science and how those fit into<br>crop 26 given the current context of<br>discussions over there<br>so<br>i<br>want to start with a big picture<br>question uh for everyone around cop26<br>what's happening there what we expect to<br>happen next uh what some of the<br>desirable outcomes would be and what<br>they look like so hand over first to<br>hello koto my name is jennifer nichol<br>i'm a counselor at the waikato regional<br>council and i represent the community of<br>hamilton and um in my background i have<br>been a scientist by training at the<br>university of waikato<br>having then worked at the auckland<br>cancer society research center and then<br>moved on to fonterra to be an<br>environmental manager before moving into<br>um<br>that the counselor role now so i've had<br>a bit of a science and environmental<br>management and<br>and now policy and<br>uh local government background uh around<br>cop 26 uh i i mean i won't list out the<br>things that can be you know read about<br>in the news about um what's all the<br>things that's happening there just now<br>um but<br>i do want to say that you know some<br>people were quite fatigued about the<br>fact that there are this many um<br>conference of parties you know number 26<br>on this topic<br>but at the same time i'm<br>really really optimistic based on what<br>i've learned so far about the process so<br>the paris agreement being signed in 2015<br>having<br>a lot more structure built into it to<br>allow the targets that<br>being set to actually need to be<br>delivered upon so the exciting thing<br>about this cop in particular is that um<br>it's the five<br>it's the fifth one after<br>the paris agreement so that means that<br>the national determined contributions<br>been announced<br>where each country says how much they<br>can do by a certain point in time and<br>then after that what will happen is that<br>they'll be held accountable to that and<br>audited to that<br>um and the idea is that these will get<br>increased over time so where we're at at<br>the moment from what i could hear is<br>um prior to cop 26 all the<br>nationally determined contributions um<br>were set at something like possibly a<br>2.7<br>um 2.7 degree<br>um<br>temperature<br>increase uh and whereas now they're<br>talking about an average of about 1.8 so<br>since one of the big benefits of cop26<br>is to keep 1.5 degrees alive<br>um it's it's definitely making some<br>progress but there will be definitely<br>more needed so i'm just really hoping<br>that the people there keep doing what<br>they're doing<br>while everybody else is um getting to<br>know climate change in their everyday<br>lives in their workplace how they relate<br>to it and doing what they can and their<br>little puzzle piece of the giant picture<br>that we need to build in order to<br>um bring it all together and that<br>includes the the small<br>things that people do in their lives to<br>show the demand to help the market move<br>as as the large forces at cop26 meet the<br>bottom up so yeah i'm really excited<br>that it's it's getting somewhere<br>i'll just pass on um to the next person<br>um yeah i'm nathan cooper i'm a uh<br>associate professor at um tipperinger at<br>the university of waikato faculty of law<br>i work in sort of my research areas<br>around<br>human rights and environment and i'm i'm<br>really interested in legal theory and<br>how<br>uh theories can be sort of brought to<br>bear on on practice and help us sort of<br>uh look at new perspectives new ways of<br>tackling uh<br>the the sort of challenges that we're<br>facing and obviously one of the the<br>biggest challenge the most existential<br>challenge that we're facing at the<br>moment is around climate change and um<br>and that's what cop is all around<br>and all about<br>um<br>i suppose a little bit a little bit<br>different to jennifer i'm i'm<br>a little bit disappointed about where<br>we're up to in terms of cop 26 at the<br>moment um following the um following<br>closely the preparation for the cop and<br>then the first week um it feels a little<br>bit of a roller coaster um there's been<br>such a a a level of anticipation<br>probably like never before um certainly<br>not for the last couple of cops in terms<br>of um<br>expectations uh what's going to happen<br>in the cop this has been described as<br>the last best hope um which really um is<br>is somewhat hyperbolic but but maybe<br>it's got some some truth in it as well<br>what are we going to find<br>as the cop draws to a close in the next<br>couple of days and then there was a bit<br>of optimism last week and we saw those<br>kind of big ticket big headline grabbing<br>um initiatives<br>around<br>voluntary agreements on methane<br>reduction on deforestation and<br>reforestation etc and some good news um<br>india for instance one of the one of the<br>largest pollutants at the moment um<br>putting together a<br>net carbon zero<br>target<br>by 2070 which was a bit of a surprise so<br>some optimist optimism there and now<br>we're kind of<br>kind of coming over the custom and<br>there's some pessimism as well as as<br>those numbers are banded around uh 1.8<br>uh degrees um<br>seems to be the absolute best um<br>reading of the situation at the moment<br>and um<br>putting that into some perspective<br>uh the target of 1.5 is is not an<br>arbitrary target it it's essentially the<br>the the least worst outcome so the the<br>difference between the consequences of<br>the world uh heated one and a half<br>degrees above pre-industrial level and<br>1.8 degrees is really significant so<br>even um on the best reading there's an<br>awful long way to go before we<br>can get a sense that we're on top of<br>this that this is in somehow under a<br>level of control<br>in terms of the specifics um there's<br>quite a lot of negotiation um topics<br>still to get through and still um an<br>awful lot of really important decisions<br>uh to be made um in terms of really<br>important things<br>for um for new zealand and the<br>consequences for new zealand um as uh as<br>was alluded to new zealand's new um<br>nationally determined contribution our<br>new pledge on car on emissions<br>reductions been announced it's more um<br>it's more ambitious than the previous<br>one um but in terms of the detail how we<br>how are we going to actually manage to<br>to to to to<br>to meet that pledge<br>one of the ways that we're going to be<br>able to do it<br>is to use<br>overseas activities in other words to um<br>to be able to count in our own pledge<br>what goes on um<br>outside of outside of new zealand now in<br>order to be able to do that and to be<br>able to do that with any certainty we<br>need the rules around overseas<br>activities to be<br>clear and they're not clear um from the<br>paris agreement uh they're vague and<br>they're still up for negotiation as we<br>speak so hopefully in the next couple of<br>days we'll get a bit more clarity around<br>um that bit of the paris agreements so<br>that countries<br>new zealand is not unusual in that<br>respect but um countries that have that<br>that will include in their plan<br>operations that are offshore and<br>emissions reductions activities that are<br>outside of of their country<br>these rules need to be clear so that we<br>know how do we count these are we double<br>counting is there transparency and<br>fairness in that system<br>the other big<br>element for me which is which is still<br>undecided is the the question of<br>so-called ratcheting so<br>the commitment currently is that<br>countries parties to the paris agreement<br>are uh required every five years to come<br>back and produce this nationally<br>determined contribution and the idea is<br>that over time the contributions become<br>more<br>uh<br>more um<br>uh<br>um<br>sorry i've got lost lost the word um<br>they've become uh ambitious ambitious<br>thank you barry<br>fantastic<br>they become more ambitious um and<br>they're not able to slip backwards now<br>even with 1.8 um on on the table as a<br>best reading at the moment uh there's<br>considerable pressure from developing<br>countries to um to go back to the table<br>about the ratcheting clause and actually<br>to advocate for uh for bigger polluting<br>countries to have to come back and<br>ratchet up their contributions possibly<br>every year<br>now again if that's if there's any<br>movement on that in negotiations then<br>that's going to have really significant<br>consequences but that could be a good<br>thing in terms of really putting the<br>pressure on<br>so um a long way to go in what's uh<br>what's still only a couple of days worth<br>of negotiations and i'm really hoping<br>that the rollercoaster will continue and<br>it will kind of finish on the slightly<br>more optimistic uh tilt but i'll i'll<br>leave that there in terms of the first<br>reflections<br>thank you nathan uh pass over to dennis<br>yes mourinho my name is dennis tegg uh<br>i'm a colleague of jennifer's<br>the team's coromandel<br>representative on the regional council<br>uh practice as a lawyer in teams for<br>45 odd years<br>um and has been i've been heavily<br>involved in issues relating to<br>coastal hazards and adaptation around<br>the coromandel coast<br>yeah i tend to come down on more on<br>nathan's and jennifer's<br>side in terms of<br>my my attitude to cop um<br>as he said it's been a bit of a roller<br>coaster um<br>i suppose my major concern<br>uh is that really china and russia are<br>not not part of the discussions<br>my own feeling is that<br>the governments really have to grasp<br>that there is the technology to to beat<br>this um beatles problem<br>but if they get stuck in<br>and continue to subsidize the legacy<br>fossil fuel and<br>partly agriculture<br>production models<br>then then we're not going to get there<br>but if if they really grasp the nettle<br>and and put the investment into<br>new technologies maybe this is something<br>we can touch on later in the innovation<br>section<br>then i think i'm much more um<br>optimistic about<br>being able to get there but um<br>nathan mentioned the 1.8 degrees is<br>perhaps the absolute best<br>and i i just seen a discussion from<br>professor tim naish<br>and he's saying that the latest science<br>on<br>sea level rise is that if<br>if we tip over two degrees<br>then there is um that's that's a tipping<br>point beyond which<br>sea level rise is basically irreversible<br>and we could then face<br>potentially two metres by the end of the<br>century and then<br>over millennium 15 to<br>20<br>meters so<br>um you know<br>keeping under two degrees is absolutely<br>essential<br>and you know<br>i'm a bit ambivalent about whether we're<br>going to make it um<br>on our on our own um contribution i'm<br>sorry i think i share that concern i'm<br>disappointed in our<br>uh position at the moment there's a<br>newsroom article uh just<br>looking at the headline it says<br>new zealand goes from innovator to hand<br>wringer on climate and i think that sums<br>up my position relating to<br>you know the government's contribution<br>at the stage<br>you know we won't even have our<br>our emission reduction plan for another<br>six months and it really should have<br>been ready for this conference i believe<br>and then we have um to take a legal look<br>at things um<br>lawyers for climate action taking a<br>judicial review<br>against the climate commission and the<br>ministers um<br>you know budgets carbon budgets and<br>and basically<br>citing there that's a actually a basic<br>mathematical error<br>in the way that our contribution has<br>been determined so um yeah<br>it's a bit of a mixed bag for me but um<br>you know if we do grasp that nettle and<br>and really push on with investment in<br>these available technologies and i'm not<br>i'm not talking about new ones um that<br>haven't been<br>you know proven yet um<br>then then i think there's some sense of<br>optimism<br>thanks<br>thank you dennis and we will return to<br>some of those points as we go through<br>hand over now to uh sarah for initial<br>comments<br>thanks thomas um kyoto koto i'm sarah<br>thompson i'm a hamilton city councillor<br>and also have a background in law um and<br>some good comments have already been<br>made so i won't traverse back over um<br>that ground but i would say from a local<br>perspective something i would like to<br>see from this conference is is new<br>zealand actually pressured to<br>commit to more of its emissions being<br>tackled here locally<br>i'm i find the<br>fact that we're looking at a large<br>majority of our missions<br>being offset overseas quite concerning<br>and<br>i think that what we need to be doing is<br>looking at how we can improve well-being<br>of people through<br>climate action so uh thinking here<br>locally within hamilton we have so many<br>opportunities to improve speed improve<br>people's um health and well-being um<br>whether it be through a better transport<br>system um which gives people more<br>options or<br>more resilient you know warmer homes and<br>things like that so<br>um at the moment the<br>the government action around climate<br>change locally has been incredibly<br>disappointing um and there's been lots<br>of opportunities lost for example um<br>here in hamilton the council is really<br>trying to make progress on things like<br>cycleways and public transport<br>um but because only two percent of the<br>entire transport budget goes towards<br>walking and cycling<br>it's meant that the pot is too small and<br>a lot of our projects which the<br>community have supported<br>and which we put money into the<br>long-term plan for<br>have actually missed out on co-funding<br>and it kind of seems quite ironic that<br>in a climate emergency we can't even get<br>a few million dollars to progress some<br>low cap and transport projects so<br>um from a personal personal perspective<br>i'd like to see uh<br>cop actually that i think there's talk<br>about<br>getting countries to commit to more of<br>their emissions being<br>domestic emissions reductions and that's<br>something that i think would be a huge<br>benefit for people<br>um<br>along with of course uh reaching some<br>kind of agreement which keeps us below<br>at at least that 1.8<br>secure<br>thank you sarah uh some some really good<br>comments there about uh how new zealand<br>should respond uh and over now to uh<br>barry barton<br>yeah<br>i'm a uh a lecturer a professor at the<br>uh<br>from waikato uh law school and i work on<br>energy<br>climate change natural resources and uh<br>we now offer a uh a course on climate<br>change law uh which is getting good<br>update from our students<br>uh<br>let me um<br>reflect for a moment on the on the<br>actual negotiations what's going on um<br>cop 26 is important as uh<br>well several of my colleagues here have<br>said uh<br>because in some ways it is the last<br>great hope on the other hand it is the<br>26th in a line of annual conferences<br>since the<br>united nations framework convention on<br>climate change in 1992<br>um<br>so it's part of a process and it is long<br>and it's frustrating<br>and we won't get everything we need but<br>essentially it is it is the world's way<br>of dealing with a giant coordination<br>problem um getting everyone more or less<br>on site<br>so uh there have been successes and<br>failures uh and uh in international<br>negotiations sometimes procrastination<br>is a virtue it's better than an outright<br>bloodbath<br>uh sometimes ambiguity creative<br>ambiguity is the best way that<br>negotiators can find so there will be a<br>cop 27 and a cop 37 and goodness knows<br>how many more we just have to hope that<br>the negotiators then and and the people<br>in the various countries behind them uh<br>will be able to look back and say that<br>their predecessors did a good job in the<br>circumstances<br>three main things going on really uh<br>first of all the the need for increased<br>ambitions and uh um nathan and dennis in<br>particular have have touched on this uh<br>that is that is absolutely uh critical<br>um so<br>efforts to concretize that<br>second thing going on uh that that<br>actually i in some ways i think is is<br>the central<br>component of the negotiations and<br>the point on which everything else<br>depends<br>and that is<br>financial support for developing<br>countries<br>the commitment uh in particular a while<br>ago to 100 billion dollars per annum<br>which sounds like a stupendous amount of<br>money but we're talking about the world<br>as a whole<br>um<br>and it's necessary to to<br>meet conditional commitments a lot of<br>countries have made but above all to<br>what has characterized climate change<br>negotiations is incredible lack of trust<br>uh between the developed and the<br>developing worlds and the developing<br>worlds in particular has seen the whole<br>thing as not so much an environmental<br>murder as a uh an equity justice and<br>development matter<br>and and that's cost us dearly you can<br>basically look at 15 years of lack of<br>progress after kyoto has been directly<br>attributable to that total impasse<br>so<br>um<br>the the money for assisting developing<br>countries to to leapfrog old<br>technologies into new ones uh the money<br>for what is called loss and damage<br>basically for adaptation<br>uh this is central so it's good that new<br>zealand improved its performance i<br>expect there's still more to be done<br>the third thing is is what's called the<br>paris agreement rule book um<br>uh the the there's a certain amount of<br>detail in the paris agreement and the<br>convention behind it but there are<br>hundreds of pages more detailed needed<br>to put these things into operations<br>and<br>we've already touched on the emissions<br>trading international trading<br>and the uh<br>the the the uncertainty about using<br>international units to offset uh our<br>local obligations<br>short point is new zealand has always<br>depended on that under one government or<br>another um and<br>um<br>it's it's it's an unsatisfactory truth<br>but it is a truth<br>we used huge numbers of very dodgy units<br>10 years or so ago and it caused the<br>emissions trading scheme ugly to crash<br>um<br>the it was on the basis of units that<br>weren't worth a down uh they were they<br>were plainly uh incapable of coming up<br>to audit to put it politely uh the<br>international community isn't going to<br>let that happen again so so one of the<br>awkward things is that if indeed the<br>article six negotiations result in a<br>scheme for new zealand and others to be<br>able to buy units from overseas then uh<br>we will pay a pretty high price they'll<br>be good quality units and everyone will<br>be wanting them um so it won't actually<br>be much of a get out of jail card<br>um and in fact what it will do is it'll<br>it'll make more clear we're paying some<br>billions of dollars a year to countries<br>overseas uh and that will i think put<br>the spotlight rightly on the sectors in<br>new zealand that are not not doing this<br>their share of the lifting<br>agriculture uh will have to come to the<br>party in terms of biogenic methane and<br>it'll be pretty easy to work out how<br>many billions of dollars<br>of across subsidies is there<br>so there are other aspects to the to the<br>rule book uh and james shaw's involved<br>in the transparency issues which are<br>essentially the the audit uh<br>verification um reporting monitoring a<br>lot of countries perfectly happy with<br>that new zealand is in pretty good shape<br>but some countries<br>like russia and china not very happy to<br>supply huge amounts of<br>detailed information about their<br>industries um to international foreign<br>so those are the things that we'll be<br>working on<br>anyway there's a few things i think that<br>are important and indeed we have to hope<br>that our negotiators have global<br>negotiators will do a good job in the<br>next few days goodness knows how much<br>sleep they will get probably not much<br>thank you<br>thank you barry for those comments and<br>before i segue on i just wanted to<br>make a few comments myself first of all<br>by way of introduction<br>so i'm thomas givens i'm a practicing<br>lawyer in hamilton and a<br>graduate in law and planning so my<br>interests are across<br>property and resource management and<br>increasingly<br>how those translate into the bigger<br>issues that have been talked about<br>and it really strikes me that there's<br>this this mix of<br>of course the international context and<br>of course the local context it's um<br>fairly trite to say that but<br>really interested um in the comments<br>about how those overlap and feed into<br>each other in terms of how<br>new zealand is acting as an<br>international citizen what it is relying<br>on others for<br>and and how behaviours are driven and<br>changed uh locally as well<br>and so we are obviously talking across<br>broad issues of cop26 and also<br>law innovation and science<br>i'm going to make a brief comment on on<br>the limits of law<br>and one of those is highlighted in a<br>recent court case which was brought by<br>a member of the public essentially<br>interested in how<br>a tort based claim could be used against<br>some of new zealand's bigger companies<br>to require them to take some greater<br>action<br>in respect of climate change indicators<br>in response<br>and<br>highlights the limits i suppose of the<br>legal system sometimes<br>when the court said this is an<br>innovative idea but but not the right<br>approach<br>and that really reinforces that there's<br>a need for<br>policy makers and the community overall<br>to respond<br>rather than the courts the courts are<br>at times shrugging their shoulders on<br>some of these issues<br>or more generously<br>they're saying that courts are not the<br>right approach but<br>really interested in bringing out some<br>of the ideas and comments that people<br>have<br>both around law and<br>around innovation and i think to<br>keep those moving promptly we'll we'll<br>start with dennis who wanted to make<br>some comments on innovation and<br>feed in from there<br>okay um that's fine yes thanks um<br>look um you know as i said earlier i<br>think<br>there is there is existing technology<br>to to tackle<br>the crisis and i particularly um<br>refer to a report by a futurist called<br>tony sieber<br>and he's part of a think tank called<br>rethink x<br>and he's just uh his his uh group has<br>put out a<br>a report on climate implications and<br>essentially there are he says there are<br>three<br>three parts to innovation that are<br>essential to to this issue<br>uh it's basically energy transport and<br>food<br>um<br>and<br>and these aren't um i we saw<br>at the regional council a uh talk by<br>paul winton and he referred to unicorns<br>and he he was referring to sort of<br>unproven technology so<br>so these aren't<br>these don't fall in that category<br>um like you know carbon capture and<br>storage which is touted as a solution<br>when when really it's unproven so so<br>these these technologies are are readily<br>available now<br>um and if i just touch on them sort of<br>in<br>in turn um so on energy we've got wind<br>solar and and large scale battery<br>storage<br>and then the analysis from zebra and<br>others is that<br>already the cost curve of those<br>technologies has been impressive in the<br>last<br>10 years perhaps dropping around 70 or<br>80 percent<br>and<br>the expectations are still another 70 or<br>80 to go by the end of this decade<br>and so that<br>that allows these these<br>these<br>three technologies when they're combined<br>to basically provide enough power to<br>to run the the global economy without<br>using fossil fuels so that's quite an<br>exciting prospect and<br>in new zealand we've really been slow i<br>think to<br>to adopt those technologies i mean<br>there's there's actually quite a lot of<br>wind power that's already consented<br>under the rma but it's never been built<br>and that's just showing a sort of a lack<br>of ambition and<br>investment<br>so i i'm quite um i'm quite encouraged<br>by that<br>and then his other<br>uh second leg is um basically the<br>electrification of transport and i know<br>that electric cars aren't the only<br>answer um and we have to have mode shift<br>as well and i know sarah will will no<br>doubt talk to that<br>um<br>but um what<br>what this report is saying on transport<br>is that again there's an exponential<br>cost curve that's been written down um<br>and<br>uh to give you one example<br>of where i think we're we're not quite<br>up with the play<br>the climate commission and its report<br>has suggested<br>that the sticker price parity between an<br>ev and an internal combustion engine<br>won't be reached<br>until 2026<br>but i'm aware of the chinese<br>manufacturers bringing out evs to new<br>zealand next year<br>which will achieve<br>price parity<br>with an equivalent uh petrol or diesel<br>car<br>so i think this change uh is going to<br>happen a lot faster than<br>than many of the sort of business as<br>usual pundits<br>imagine and<br>and in a way it's not going to be<br>the emission reduction of a vehicle that<br>drives the change it's going to be<br>market forces<br>um so so that's encouraging as well<br>and then i i hear you say well what<br>about agricultural emissions<br>um<br>and you know we've been certainly um<br>slow to respond to that<br>but what's flying under the radar is<br>a new food technology called precision<br>fermentation<br>and<br>and zebra and others are saying and<br>there's already plenty of examples of it<br>out there but again there's a cost curve<br>that can be written down<br>where the projections of some of these<br>people<br>is that by<br>mid-decade there will be cost parity<br>with making dairy protein in a vat<br>compared to that from animal protein<br>and that by the end of the end of this<br>decade it'll be five times cheaper<br>and by 2035 will be ten times cheaper<br>and so if if that was to come to pass<br>then<br>i mean on the one hand that's very bad<br>news for the dairy industry in new<br>zealand but it could be very good news<br>for<br>for global<br>emissions reductions and agriculture<br>so you know those are some of the some<br>of the ideas out there that if you look<br>at this latest report from from this<br>rethink x group<br>um there is some reason for optimism<br>so you know i think<br>this isn't really widely understood or<br>known i know my many of my fellow<br>councillors<br>are unaware of<br>these sort of um<br>the sort of exponential growth and the s<br>curve adoption of these new technologies<br>that<br>that i appreciate aren't the whole<br>answer but they can certainly go a long<br>way to it<br>so yeah i'll leave that there thanks<br>thank you dennis uh<br>yeah interesting interesting comments on<br>the role of technology and innovation<br>there<br>and<br>interested uh sarah and hearing from you<br>about um<br>your comments on on the role of um<br>not just innovation but also law perhaps<br>uh giving you a role in that area<br>thanks thomas um<br>firstly uh<br>acknowledging what dennis has said there<br>i think there are a few areas where<br>we're seeing progress so you've got<br>technology coming through and then<br>there's the public pressure and<br>of putting being put on politicians and<br>then you have the legal side of things<br>also putting pressure on them for that<br>change so i and i think all of<br>them are important<br>i think that<br>the<br>legal approach does have limitations<br>like you said for example um trying to<br>take a talk claim can be<br>difficult um particularly here in new<br>zealand i think overseas it would have a<br>better chance but um our courts are<br>relatively conservative<br>uh and it can be very hard to link the<br>actions of say one uh company to then<br>the actual impacts of climate change<br>because it's so accumulative<br>um you know you've got actions from all<br>over the world which together are um<br>causing these uh impacts on the climate<br>so<br>uh that link can be hard to make<br>um<br>but there is a role for it i think that<br>things like judicial review are actually<br>quite powerful both in terms of creating<br>public awareness<br>of an issue and highlighting say a lack<br>of ambition or a lack of action or poor<br>decision making<br>and um an example of that<br>you know if you think of uh the regional<br>land transport plan in auckland which um<br>is being challenged<br>uh<br>and and then the one in waikoto which<br>honestly probably should be challenged<br>um you know there was some poor decision<br>making there where for example in the<br>wire cutter we didn't even measure what<br>the impact of a transport claim was<br>going to have on emissions within the<br>region and so you can clearly say well<br>hold on<br>that was a critical<br>consideration you should have taken into<br>account<br>and by say taking an action against that<br>your<br>officials and<br>people making decisions will<br>take that into account and and improve<br>what they're doing<br>um<br>and i think that<br>and on the broader scale<br>um<br>if you look at things like mill road and<br>auckland that pressure there that was<br>put on decision makers<br>by<br>i think it was all a board group um i<br>think must probably also<br>had a real<br>impact on decisions to scale back<br>uh what was going to be a transport<br>project that<br>induced more driving and admissions<br>so<br>there's definitely a place there for um<br>for taking legal action to bring about<br>change<br>but<br>the courts prefer an incremental<br>approach they're not particularly here<br>in new zealand they really<br>um are willing to make a decision that<br>kind of turns everything on its head and<br>cracks<br>i guess a new principle that<br>um is very different to what<br>the courts have um enforced before that<br>so you can see that in the most recent<br>case you mentioned thomas where they<br>said this is going too far from what we<br>usually um i guess<br>you sarah so interested in the last few<br>minutes on on touching on a few comments<br>around<br>again the international and the local<br>and how that fits into<br>uh legal policy market and community<br>frameworks<br>so make it that what you will just<br>wanted a few comments from you<br>nathan<br>and jennifer perhaps<br>just around some of those international<br>uh issues translating into into local<br>actions<br>yeah absolutely um yes really really<br>interesting kind of reflections in terms<br>of what's what's possible in terms of<br>legal innovation um i suppose<br>one of the things that i<br>find some comfort in is actually looking<br>at what else is going on in other<br>jurisdictions and then thinking about<br>how that may or may not um<br>impact where we are now and here and you<br>know in terms of innovation what we've<br>seen in recent years in the field of law<br>is a whole new wave of climate<br>litigation<br>which is being used to to really good<br>effects in lots of different places lots<br>of different jurisdictions so um a<br>couple of years ago<br>um in the netherlands the the the dutch<br>core<br>the dutch government was was um ordered<br>to essentially take much more stringent<br>steps to address uh um emissions<br>reductions uh as a result of uh<br>litigation pushed forward by a a climate<br>environmental group and the way in which<br>that was argued was to link<br>climate change and the effects of<br>climate change on individuals to<br>human rights<br>and in particular to uh rights under the<br>european convention<br>of human rights around the right to life<br>and the right to uh private and family<br>life<br>so that's kind of<br>uh one little example of where um<br>both litigators but also courts have<br>been willing to take innovative steps um<br>in in terms of pushing forward greater<br>protections in response to climate<br>change we're seeing other emanations of<br>that elsewhere in different<br>different ways through of linking rights<br>and rights talk into constitutional<br>provisions both national constitutions<br>state constitutions new york new york<br>state<br>just a couple of weeks ago<br>amended added an amendment to their<br>state constitution to acknowledge that<br>everybody has the right to a healthy<br>environment to clean air to clean water<br>and<br>a healthful environment as they as they<br>turned it um and so there's<br>there's little examples there on the on<br>on the horizon that um<br>really are quite new and<br>have got the potential to<br>not only encourage<br>our own courts to be a little bit<br>more progressive<br>but also<br>to really galvanize public opinion and<br>public support and i'm particularly<br>interested in that in that narrative of<br>rights um<br>not to get too hung up on on on human<br>rights but i think there's something<br>there that could be used to really good<br>effect in terms of focusing our<br>attention on what our rights are to a<br>healthy environment<br>and claiming those rights not just for<br>us but also for our children and for<br>future generations as well because<br>there's a sort of a power in that<br>language in a power in that vocabulary<br>and it's also<br>a vocabulary that we're kind of used to<br>as well so we back we bandy round uh<br>sort of individual rights um quite often<br>and so extending that to the field of<br>environmental protection and thinking<br>about what would a healthy environment<br>look like and what would having a right<br>to that healthy environment look like in<br>practice i think is it is a an area<br>that's really kind of fertile for<br>exploring in terms of legal innovation<br>i'll leave that there because i'm aware<br>that um<br>other people will want to chip in as<br>well but um there's lots more where that<br>came from in case we get a chance to<br>come back<br>thank you nathan i hope too uh but no<br>really good comments there around<br>rights and the role of language and so<br>on um<br>and and on the court's response<br>so jennifer just interested in you<br>picking up on the<br>um the local action aspect of of that<br>and how uh international issues<br>translate into<br>um<br>local actions from uh<br>in particular from a council which is<br>both a community representative body and<br>a regulatory body in some ways so<br>interested in<br>some comments from you there before we<br>wind up<br>thank you um so<br>um i'm i can see that<br>the the legal action that's been taken<br>overseas is certainly ramped up and i<br>wouldn't be surprised at all as there's<br>a few others have commented um that i<br>think that that will increase here<br>locally as well<br>um and and rightfully so in some ways<br>because when you look at the fact that<br>climate change has been known about for<br>such a long time<br>decades and decades and even um you know<br>the<br>the quite shocking news that came out a<br>while back about the fact that there are<br>oil companies such as bp whose<br>scientists were<br>making these connections around climate<br>change and they really had a moment in<br>time where they could have<br>shifted their model but but actually<br>chose to double down and extract as much<br>oil as possible and do that for decades<br>to come<br>and really just invest in and lobbying<br>to<br>deny and delay action on climate change<br>i mean there's there's an injustice<br>there that<br>um i'd be hugely surprised if that um<br>was not to receive more attention in<br>future and i i note that even just um<br>you know with with the case that was<br>mentioned before about locally how<br>um you know there's a bit more narrative<br>now on<br>um who are the biggest emitters in new<br>zealand and<br>they have um well they all are all large<br>companies<br>some of them international companies and<br>so they have the resources and knowledge<br>to do something on this and and they<br>have a disproportional um impact on our<br>emissions profile compared to joe bloggs<br>down the street right so<br>so really keen to to see where that goes<br>um and but from um<br>if i think about the<br>international<br>parts around cop i mean i'm really<br>grateful for barry for just explaining<br>my my reasons for hope a little bit more<br>um to be honest i don't have any other<br>choice than to be hopeful<br>uh the other alternative isn't something<br>i like to think about so<br>um but but it's actually been by doing<br>this role in the regional council even<br>just the last two years that i've seen<br>well learned to understand<br>the legal processes<br>um the policy processes to a degree<br>where i have more hope than ever before<br>because ultimately these shifts of<br>systemic shifts in our economy etc are<br>not going to happen with a new system we<br>simply don't have time to create a new<br>system<br>um to then fix the problem we need to<br>work with the existing system and tweak<br>it and shift it to fix the problem<br>and you can then call it a new system<br>but that's fine uh and so<br>uh on top of that i think<br>uh especially when it comes to you know<br>the very large emitters that are going<br>to have to change the most um i think<br>some of them are absolutely dreaming<br>in regards to how long they believe<br>they'll have the social licence to<br>actually do things the way that they do<br>you know um<br>i would<br>i'd say that social<br>perception on this topic is on an<br>exponential curve also and it has<br>certainly been very slow over the past<br>few decades thanks to you know the<br>forces i mentioned before but that is<br>increasing really rapidly when i look at<br>a couple of years to now the amount of<br>people that are talking about climate<br>change knowledgeable about climate<br>change demanding action on climate<br>change locally and internationally um<br>that's really hopeful and so when you've<br>got a process like cocktails at the<br>conference of the parties you've got um<br>the paris agreement and then that<br>translates directly into the zero carbon<br>act um here in new zealand which was you<br>know just want to give a big ups to<br>generation zero who drafted that idea as<br>a part of that group about a decade ago<br>um<br>to be able to make it easy for the<br>government to kind of see a way forward<br>with the community to develop that and<br>then that translating into the<br>commitments under that of the national<br>mission reduction plan um which i have<br>you know i really hope that lots of<br>people are making submissions on right<br>now um in the national adaptation plan<br>and then we are currently at the<br>regional council working on a regional<br>emission reduction plan and regional<br>adaptation plan and so as we make this<br>more and more local the local action<br>will happen<br>and so<br>i think um while while that happens in a<br>government space the market obviously<br>has to move and the science and<br>innovation will help with that but a lot<br>of it will<br>actually not necessarily be technology a<br>lot of it will be<br>um<br>simplifying our lives a bit and and just<br>looking at whether there's a way that we<br>can uh not sacrifice the things that are<br>really important to us but sacrifice the<br>the things that aren't um and be able to<br>do them thanks to the market in a way<br>that is cheaper than the<br>um and less desirable alternative<br>and and solve a problem at the same time<br>so<br>yeah as long as we get that just<br>transition right um between the market<br>and the government policies coming<br>together i think it's entirely entirely<br>possible<br>thank you jennifer a lot of a lot of<br>good comments on there so<br>um given the constraints of time i was<br>just going to touch on a few points that<br>have been covered today and there's<br>obviously been a<br>mammoth level of ground uh covered<br>excuse the analogy here uh the<br>the issues that have come up around uh<br>rights and and trust and what is<br>happening internationally and what is<br>happening locally and from a lawyer's<br>perspective the role of the courts<br>versus the role of um<br>central government local government uh<br>arrangements<br>the role of negotiators<br>there's also been useful comment uh<br>important comment on<br>on disappointment and ambivalence<br>but also optimism and hope and i think<br>um<br>yeah it's a testament to our speakers<br>today that such a<br>a great level of ground around<br>regulation around the market around<br>communities international bodies and<br>everything in between is able to be<br>covered so<br>i<br>wanted to acknowledge the university of<br>waikato for hosting<br>this panel and<br>particularly a shout out to its<br>attention to<br>this field and the new bachelor of<br>climate change<br>uh and and also the university is<br>fortunate enough to<br>have people so knowledgeable in this<br>area uh such as barry barton and nathan<br>cooper so thank you to both for your<br>contributions<br>uh also wanted to touch on the fact that<br>um<br>we're we're well served on the waikato<br>locally by those with an interest<br>in the topic at a<br>local government level so<br>um sarah thompson thank you and uh<br>jennifer nichol and dennis tegg also<br>thank you um<br>you know both local and and regional<br>levels of government and institutions<br>like university there is this um level<br>of interest and attunement to these<br>issues<br>and i think um<br>really just to wind up there's been this<br>important level of attention to not just<br>what is happening internationally but<br>what is happening locally and how<br>what seem like small issues or small<br>decisions locally can really make a big<br>difference over time and<br>on that note with a thank you to all the<br>panelists<br>just wanted to encourage everyone who's<br>watching to go up there and do the event<br>as well<br>thank you<br>the university of waikato is proud to<br>introduce the world's first bachelor of<br>climate change for the people who know<br>there is no planet b<br>gain the skills needed for the jobs of<br>tomorrow contribute to a fundamental<br>shift in the way we do business and go<br>about our lives<br>explore how matauranga maori can bring<br>perspective to the most pressing issue<br>of our time<br>apply now and carve a
