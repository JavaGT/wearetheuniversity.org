stream from waikato<br>university<br>around the cop 26 conference<br>today we'll be focusing on the<br>theme of adaptation and resilience<br>following last night's session at the<br>conference<br>and we have about nine speakers and with<br>a bit of luck we'll have some time at<br>the entrance<br>for some corridor so<br>i'd like to hand over to hamish mcdewell<br>of local government new zealand<br>resilience and adaptation are two legs<br>of the climate response and something<br>that local government needs to embrace<br>as<br>conversations to have with the<br>communities right now<br>one of local government's great assets<br>is its ability to know and<br>uh work with and engage with different<br>sectors of every community within the<br>rohit boundaries<br>however i make a plea here<br>for mitigation<br>the greater the success of mitigation<br>the lesser the adaptation required uh<br>the less the resilience will be stress<br>tested<br>but the reality is whether the world can<br>keep temperatures to 1.5 or as soon is<br>more likely from<br>cop 26<br>1.9 degrees above pre-industrial levels<br>there will be radical changes to our<br>environment and changes in our lifestyle<br>i recall a farmer who came up to me when<br>i was campaigning uh for the mayoralty<br>uh<br>on a climate change ticket uh she said<br>uh what do you<br>why why are you wanting to<br>change my lifestyle and i responded<br>well you're<br>changing my lifestyle right now with<br>what you're doing<br>hawako ikenna we're all in us together<br>we're all connected and we all must<br>adapt<br>now adaptation i see is<br>adaptation of jobs adaptation of land<br>use<br>adaptation<br>uh to the greater frequency of natural<br>disasters uh you know what industries<br>are sustainable what local what<br>localities are viable<br>adaptations right across the board and<br>in mangano although we're on the coast<br>we're actually less vulnerable to<br>coastal inundation<br>but around the nation some 14 billion<br>dollars of council assets are at risks<br>these are airports these are wastewater<br>treatment plants ports<br>important buildings they're all<br>vulnerable<br>there are also some communities that are<br>no longer viable<br>they might be existing communities that<br>will either fall into the sea in decades<br>as erosion has its way<br>or will be flooded on such a regular<br>basis that continued existence would be<br>impossible<br>that may not affect mongolia but in monu<br>we<br>are anticipating becoming both wetter<br>and drier<br>and warmer<br>and when it will be wet it will be very<br>wet and when it is dry it will tend to<br>drought<br>storms will be more regular and more<br>intense so we anticipate more frequent<br>flood events<br>the river<br>in the city has over top the stop banks<br>three times in the last 30 years but<br>there have been another five<br>uh also near misses<br>when<br>te awa over tops<br>the stock banks some 200 houses and and<br>many buildings in the cbd get flooded<br>um<br>these include anzac parade which is<br>alongside of one of our beautiful parks<br>now pootaki mirai and topo toppo<br>buildings are also vulnerable<br>so we how do we adapt to this<br>we must look at the district plan which<br>is<br>our most powerful tool<br>that doesn't necessarily mean we should<br>preclude<br>living there that we should<br>that manage retreat is the only way i<br>remember speaking with a potamologist<br>that's a river scientist a great word<br>podmologist and he told me that you know<br>don't build higher stock banks don't<br>manage retreat<br>he said<br>learn to live with the river<br>learn to live with the river as they do<br>in launceston and tasmania where<br>a a whole row of very vintage buildings<br>great heritage buildings<br>are built to flood on more materials<br>so it's not let's not build with jib<br>let's build with concrete and it can<br>just be washed out after the flood and<br>move on<br>now of course when you try and put<br>things in the district pan this affects<br>the values of value of property and<br>that's quite frankly the value property<br>is entirely a moment of time<br>and a perfect knowledge a perfect market<br>should have perfect knowledge and uh i<br>want to acknowledge couple district<br>council for attempting to do<br>this and put<br>essentially um putting coastal<br>inundation in their district plan this<br>was challenged by the current owners<br>because of how that decision would<br>affect the values<br>uh quite frankly that's short-term<br>thinking so<br>what<br>i have to wrap up sadly and i have to<br>not stay too long i've got another<br>meeting i have to go to<br>but adaptation also means business<br>if i am thinking of wet and warmer i'm<br>thinking blights and facial eczema<br>i'm thinking some industries will<br>collapse<br>and they'll be and these might be<br>important industries<br>uh in taranaki for example these<br>conversations have to start now because<br>there's a lot of people whose economic<br>well-being<br>depends on these industries at the<br>moment they need to retrain<br>last thing environment is not uh the<br>wholly owned subsidiary of the economy<br>it's the other way around<br>and the creator of the modi model<br>decision making framework<br>modi is the life supporting capacity<br>the physical<br>to everything else<br>that supports life<br>and<br>it<br>facilitates life in everything in our<br>world<br>indigenous knowledge has a unique<br>contribution to make regarding climate<br>change adaptation and increasing<br>resilience<br>indigenous ways of knowing have always<br>sought to increase resilience<br>kaityakitanga is about enhancing modi<br>enhancing the life-supporting capacity<br>of all things and because of the<br>independence of life<br>enhancing our own potential for survival<br>our tupuna understood<br>through detailed observation over<br>generations<br>indigenous knowledge is location<br>specific<br>not universal<br>for example but i were positioned to<br>reduce the risks posed by natural<br>disasters<br>but to ensure readily accessible<br>fundamental resources for life such as<br>fresh water<br>marae are located adjacent to freshwater<br>sources springs or other secure fresh<br>water sources<br>because freshwater is not just required<br>for human survival<br>but is a necessary and necessity for<br>almost all living things to flourish<br>fresh water was valued most highly<br>and ensuring the integrity of the<br>life-giving waters was paramount in our<br>decision-making<br>now 2. focused<br>i'm just going to start up the slides<br>actually<br>so i hope you can see that our tupuna<br>focused<br>on what method<br>when you have generations of data from<br>observations and do not rely on written<br>records<br>your ways of knowing become more<br>sophisticated<br>our tupuna based their observations on<br>the life-supporting capacity of<br>everything around them<br>measured the life-supporting capacity<br>consistently and focused on the outliers<br>the allowed appropriate responses to<br>anomalies<br>harvesting in times of excess abundance<br>and applying constraint or ahui in times<br>of scarcity<br>the persistent focus<br>was to enhance the life-supporting<br>capacity of everything around them<br>the world we now live in is being<br>destroyed by a disconnection from<br>reality<br>and the forced adoption of different<br>values<br>wealth is measured in artificial terms<br>called currency shares and bitcoin<br>meanwhile wellbeing is the elusive goal<br>of the super rich who seem incapable of<br>accumulating enough wealth to be<br>satisfied<br>climate change and other forms of<br>dis-ease<br>such as species extinction deforestation<br>and biodiversity loss<br>are the inevitable consequences of this<br>superficial reality and reflect a<br>diminishing global modi<br>adaptation<br>is now a necessity for all humankind<br>if survival is going to be the outcome<br>the challenge is significant for<br>individuals<br>living in a capitalist world<br>adaptation represents the loss of the<br>convenience and freedoms<br>previously exploited<br>as the means of capital accumulation<br>a clear and compelling way of<br>communicating the necessary changes in<br>behavior is needed<br>holistic understandings of reality<br>through an indigenous lens are needed<br>the modi model decision making framework<br>returning to the value of our tupuna and<br>what they placed in terms of value on<br>fresh water the modiometer array shown<br>here is simple representation<br>of how the moti or life-supporting<br>capacity of water is measured<br>the modiometer array communicates its<br>message intuitively<br>at the bottom the graph shows the<br>cumulative impact on modi<br>the change in a positive sense is an<br>increase in life supporting capacity or<br>resilience in a negative sense is a<br>decrease in life supporting capacity or<br>increased vulnerability<br>in the case shown the result is a<br>reduction in maori over the 30-day<br>period indicated of 0.16 maori months<br>conversely the second example the<br>cumulative change of modi is an increase<br>in material 0.29<br>maori months<br>at the point shown on the timeline<br>homai tafiti instructed the chatter<br>chattahooa people in<br>one line of which is tutua maitufifiya<br>maiteraway bind all on the world of<br>light to everything else<br>it is modi that binds the physical to<br>over to you midi<br>i think i'm on a mute now yes<br>no way<br>okay<br>i'll mute myself i've got some signature<br>on this sign on my screen<br>i don't know what to do with it<br>i'll just<br>can you see that that sign on my screen<br>like<br>um i'm i'm asking the question is there<br>something sacred capable of supporting<br>the man of the senua and adapting to<br>climate change and i'm a tango defender<br>and i was disappointed and unhappy when<br>i read about the commitments that new<br>zealand's representatives took to the<br>united nations climate change conference<br>in glasgow seemingly the government has<br>proposed to meet most of new zealand's<br>international targets<br>or sequestering carbon by spending 5<br>billion on restoring forests<br>in other countries in aotearoa where 85<br>percent of the land was once covered in<br>nato forests<br>the habitat of the multitude of unique<br>species of plants birds insects and<br>reptiles only 24 of the indigenous land<br>color remains<br>of course<br>nature has been severely degraded by<br>humans peace animals and weeds over the<br>history of settlement<br>contemporaneously there is a cross or<br>loss of biodiversity with four thousand<br>indigenous species in danger of loss<br>many of the native forests such as<br>takahewai forest where i live and the<br>thai tokera are being eaten to death<br>and dying consequently here we set up<br>the voluntary community pest control uh<br>areas plan<br>from 19 2018 to<br>2029 and we call this the pest strategy<br>which was prepared in july 2018 and<br>strategy is an informal communion of the<br>owners of the farmland on the forest's<br>edge<br>the owners are predominantly indigenous<br>maori people who are shared owners of<br>individual properties<br>most of the maori share common maori<br>ancestors<br>the strategy was formed in response to<br>human activity that has led to the<br>degradation and destruction of the<br>forest and the intrusion by feral pigs<br>onto the private properties thus<br>affecting our business<br>as a communal initiative the strategy<br>has addressed the threat to the pastures<br>in the forest<br>controlling and monitoring pest animals<br>and plants as well as helping to prevent<br>the disease cody dieback so the changes<br>to have occurred are engaging mighty<br>landowners and interested pakia<br>neighbors in pest control<br>encouragement by northland regional<br>council's biosecurity team<br>instigating the rangi water bird project<br>supported by nrc and kiwi coast<br>instigating the pest strategy hunters<br>list<br>instigating the hunters alert on email<br>warning sorry it's an email warning to<br>the people in takahewai of the presence<br>of a peace strategy hunter in the forest<br>recording the cull observations<br>sightings and events of cygnus<br>significance daily subject to the<br>weather<br>disseminating the cull numbers and the<br>observations of the landowners hunters<br>and volunteers other interested peoples<br>and organizations monthly and annually<br>instigating the waitangi daya community<br>event to engage with interested peoples<br>and organizations sponsored by kiwi<br>coast<br>they're similarly disseminating<br>environmental activities through the<br>takahewai community primary or<br>newsletter and finally establishing<br>research associations<br>that's what we've been doing here<br>in maori antiquity the mother of the<br>tangata fenugreek reached aotearoa on<br>the back of tangaroa artemoana guided by<br>the kaichiki of his sacred realm<br>aotearoa is surrounded by tangaroa<br>from the stream to the ocean the land<br>in the 21st century still the tangata<br>and<br>must conform to the resource management<br>act 1991. technically<br>the father papa after all or the living<br>world<br>has been severed from tangaroa<br>into a fungible commodity<br>individually and collectively the<br>tangata fenua and our money and our mana<br>remain<br>but out of sight<br>along the way the chiefly leadership<br>accustomed to regarding tangaroa<br>artimoana as a sacred being rather than<br>a movable perishable measured and<br>profitable commodity has been replaced<br>by an ewe authority a member of<br>parliament a trust a consultant or a<br>committee of the local councils<br>at the local export court the tangata<br>fenua<br>papa our mana and our corridor have been<br>diminished to docking wood chipping<br>operations and rolled storage<br>the consequences are a massive<br>disruption of the life of the tonga<br>human rights abuses<br>and lost carbon storage potential in the<br>ruined natural world<br>none of the consequences is likely to be<br>visible on the spreadsheet that informs<br>the boardroom what is not known is not<br>countable<br>to stable irreversible catastrophe<br>the tangata fenua require an accord with<br>the government based on the principles<br>to respect indigenous rights to maintain<br>the sacred landscape and a livable<br>climate<br>the action is at the heart of our<br>generations long battle to protect<br>papatuan<br>our water father romo the god of<br>cultivated food homea the god of wild<br>foods starne the god of the forest and<br>tafedi the god of the wind and storms<br>from the northeast<br>and future generations<br>but<br>calling on the government to join us in<br>exiting the two worlds of winners and<br>losers now<br>with insight and research i suggest<br>climate change has led to a long<br>relationship of adaptation and<br>resilience<br>resilience between western science<br>meaning truth<br>and mata mali also meaning truth<br>from a perspective of<br>the creatures of the natural world are<br>sacred and valuable in their own right<br>not simply for science preventing the<br>and preventing the extinction of one<br>species versus another in consequence<br>our relations and our associated<br>organizations have had to uphold the<br>sacredness of the living world through<br>ceremonies and tapu protecting the earth<br>from anyone and anything that would<br>insult or pollute the sanctity of life<br>the tongue with the phenol would<br>consequently ensure that the government<br>and industrialists propose technologies<br>do not contaminate nature that is for us<br>a living being<br>the door to that accord lies in opening<br>up dialogue from the forest to the<br>harbour about pesticides pharmaceutical<br>residues industrial chemicals and<br>diverse waste<br>that will threaten planetary well-being<br>just as much as deforestation and<br>greenhouse gas gas emissions<br>nature is life<br>what the government and the<br>industrialists do to life<br>they will do to all life on the planet<br>ultimately<br>elevating the voice of the tangata fenu<br>alongside the voice of young people and<br>children will portray the critical role<br>of the notions of adaptation and<br>resilience in public empowerment and<br>education<br>um i think i'm next peter signal if<br>that's wrong okay<br>um yeah just like to acknowledge the<br>tangata fenua<br>and the previous speakers uh kepa and<br>media<br>um<br>my name is marcus williams i'm speaking<br>from tamaki makoto auckland the largest<br>city in new zealand which sits on the<br>boundaries the northern boundaries of<br>the waikato<br>kyoda<br>i uh<br>the city that i live in<br>has about 1.5 million people in it<br>um<br>was had the regional councils merged<br>into a what we call a super city about<br>10 years ago<br>um and<br>at that time the formation of the<br>community boards occurred<br>and<br>about a year ago i was asked to consult<br>on the plan for the community board in<br>the part of auckland that i live in<br>and my feedback was that there was a<br>lack of<br>vision and resource<br>to empower leadership at community level<br>and that is my contri contribution to<br>this kopapa today<br>is that<br>local body authorities and government<br>central government as well<br>need to be thinking about how we grow<br>the capacity at community level<br>with respect to resilience<br>in terms of climate change<br>i think media has spoken eloquently<br>about<br>the<br>power of that potential and i know about<br>and there are many examples of this and<br>i think that the<br>the modi that keeper speaks of the<br>values and the relationship with<br>tai o and<br>and the environment that is embedded in<br>tel maori<br>is a lesson for all of us<br>but the model is there as well in terms<br>of the national network of marae<br>that<br>sit in communities<br>and provide the opportunity for<br>communities to<br>work together<br>in respect to resilience with respect to<br>climate change and i think there's a<br>terrific model there<br>which we<br>as a nation don't<br>value enough and we need to support that<br>and we need to learn from it and we need<br>to replicate it because it's a powerful<br>model<br>and it's a powerful value structure<br>so that's my corridor i'll finish there<br>sorry there we go<br>apologize for that<br>well kia ora tattoo<br>i was asked to<br>be on this panel to<br>to talk of regenerative farming and the<br>things about the third or fourth time<br>i've been asked to do that<br>oh<br>it's it's it's been um the third or<br>fourth time i've been asked to talk of<br>regenerative farming which always brings<br>up the problem of of defining what it is<br>and i've always said i'm not sure what<br>regenerative farming is but i've got a<br>pretty good idea now after 40 years<br>of some regenerative practices<br>but i will attempt to say this<br>that it's nothing if it's not<br>grounded in soils and diversity and root<br>depth<br>and the fungal connections of life<br>uh that that that<br>that extend much further than<br>the roots that you see the fungal<br>connections are much deeper and wider<br>and and that's<br>is what we're attempting to expand on so<br>we need to expand those connections<br>with plants and us on the surface and<br>have to say after many years of trying<br>to understand this and look and<br>scratching the surface on that<br>uh i have to say the more you look<br>the more look at life<br>in this context the more you see that<br>every living thing on the surface<br>are really merely solar collectors and<br>fruiting bodies for the fungal world<br>which do run everything down there with<br>the uh<br>interconnectedness of the supply chains<br>you know if you're looking at it from a<br>science perspective but i'm entirely<br>with<br>mary<br>world view on this it's uh it's the<br>interconnectedness of life is what we're<br>missing out on<br>um<br>i i was very taken with the<br>very taken with this morning's session<br>on the uh everyone's complaining about<br>the<br>cop not getting there etc but this<br>morning i saw antonio gutierrez's<br>uh<br>viewpoint of nature nature-based<br>solutions having to take the fore<br>and i was so pleased about that because<br>there's a bunch of us that have been<br>trying to get that up here as well and<br>remove ourselves from the dogma that we<br>think we know with the sciences<br>and get on to get on to the natural<br>solutions and look very closely at what<br>they do<br>because it's it's nature that stores<br>carbon<br>it's nature's that that<br>stores water<br>and it's nature that cools the earth<br>with the water cycles and the<br>hydrocycles and the<br>and the interconnectedness between the<br>outer edge of our atmosphere and down as<br>deep as we we've been able to explore<br>with our puny little drills in the earth<br>it's all there<br>and so uh that that cycle<br>of that and the direct cooling that we<br>can do with that and the way in which we<br>can explore and play with that on the<br>surfaces of farmer<br>sort of matters to me<br>and so that's<br>i'm hoping that that the next patch of<br>play for ateroa is that we spend much<br>much more time looking closely in that<br>direction<br>i was taken this morning by listening to<br>the maldives who said that there'd been<br>a hundred billion<br>had been promised for adaptation but<br>hadn't been spent<br>and i thought good god you know that's<br>just what the adaptation<br>and uh i was taken with with the african<br>fellow<br>who said<br>when it rains africa cries<br>i when there's a drought africa cries<br>and that uh mitigation adaptation and<br>resilience were three sides of the same<br>coin<br>and i'm with that i think they're all<br>there in that solution for us and i<br>would argue that we<br>would ask that we if we're looking at it<br>look at the extremes have a look at what<br>vijay kumar is doing and in uh google it<br>have a look at dj kumar in<br>in<br>andhra pradesh in india what they're<br>doing with the direct cooling there and<br>supplying food changing the climate<br>harvesting the rivers of water over the<br>land and improving people's lives all in<br>one one hit it's quite dramatic so go<br>look there we get those extremes<br>the other one that i was taken with this<br>morning was the blue carbon initiative<br>because that we can look at it for<br>ourselves that easily you know there's<br>planting mangroves so you've got action<br>we can do something get on with it you<br>get protection<br>you get carbon capture and you get the<br>beautiful view of of uh<br>of we have the uh cooling cooling in the<br>intertidal zone<br>and so we<br>we've got things we can do and as<br>farmers um i'm very aware that the<br>methane question is up for an argument<br>but uh it's it's a 78 percent under<br>variability there and it's the cycle of<br>life<br>but let's get on with getting rid of the<br>nitrous oxide and the inputs of nitrogen<br>let's let's see if we can't get<br>ourselves out of the palm kernel<br>let's see if we can't get out of turning<br>the ground let's if we can't get out of<br>chasing pathology<br>as the only way forward instead of<br>chasing chasing the interconnectedness<br>of life when it gets a chance to do<br>something and look after us all<br>uh<br>thank you max my name's rick left and<br>i'm just going to share my screen i do<br>have some some slides to to share with<br>you<br>uh coincidentally<br>uh<br>the previous speaker and this current<br>speaker<br>have come from the same little town in<br>the haruki plains<br>um it would you can see here<br>what the guru is down through here and<br>this is just showing our regional<br>council coastal inundation tool<br>and i'll talk a bit more about that<br>just in a minute so i'm just going to<br>share my screen<br>there we go on team leader of regional<br>resilience at waikato regional council<br>uh the picture there that you can see<br>there is uh the settlement of kaiawa<br>uh and the water you see there is from<br>the the further thames uh on a king tide<br>snowstorm that's where the water gets to<br>on a king tide so it doesn't take too<br>much imagination<br>to see what the potential challenges uh<br>this community has in the future with<br>even a small amount of sea level rise<br>so<br>following on for what hamish talked<br>about this morning<br>at the start of this uh start of this<br>little session uh is<br>what can we do about it and what role<br>does local and central government have<br>and i've i've got listed three key<br>challenges that um that we need to to<br>focus on and the first one is very<br>simply the roles and responsibilities<br>and for the for our communities and for<br>the public and even ourselves in local<br>and central government um to know what<br>does a district council do what does a<br>regional council do and what does this<br>what does central government do as well<br>we all have<br>different roles and responsibilities<br>they all mention together<br>but how do we work together effectively<br>to make sure we are working together and<br>we are getting these goals that that we<br>want to uh we want to<br>aspire to but for the public who we need<br>to be engaging with and we are engaging<br>with<br>there's a there's a lot of<br>misconceptions around what local<br>government does and so that's a first<br>barrier that we need to try and<br>demystify<br>and provide some clarity around what we<br>do to then be able to go forward and<br>actually make some change<br>as part of the the understanding of what<br>we do as a local government central<br>government it's also getting right down<br>to their community level and<br>understanding what's the risk<br>understanding what the risk is and how<br>as a community we can then<br>incorporate and increase our resilience<br>to that to that risk and risk comprises<br>the components of the hazard how that<br>has it impacts on the exposure what gets<br>affected and the vulnerability of our<br>communities and that all comes together<br>in terms of of understanding what that<br>risk is if we understand what that risk<br>is<br>then we can start to implement change to<br>make sure that the risk is acceptable<br>move away from being intolerable<br>we can work with being tolerable<br>and live with some some risk and live<br>with some impacts but to get back to<br>where we were as quickly as possible<br>that's challenge too i'll explain a<br>little more of this in a few minutes<br>but then<br>once we know you know some of this<br>information around our communities the<br>risks uh and how we want to be resilient<br>how do we implement that change<br>and hamish mentioned it before you know<br>when you're trying to identify places of<br>that have a hazard or have a risk<br>immediately a lot of people think uh<br>about the value on their property<br>all right but as for the previous<br>speakers that we that we've that we've<br>had meri and kipa<br>what is the value<br>all right is it financial is it is it is<br>it social is it environmental we need to<br>understand what those different risks<br>are and how they um how they are<br>impacted on our four values of financial<br>environmental<br>social<br>and<br>i forgot the last one um so we need to<br>cultural so we need to make sure that we<br>are understanding what those risks are<br>and how we how do we implement change<br>and a big part of that is again<br>understanding what your your thresholds<br>are at what point do you go no<br>that's enough we're not going to<br>tolerate that that's intolerable<br>all right how do we move to that<br>tolerable level and how do to move to<br>being acceptable now that's your<br>threshold it's our threshold and and<br>that's changes people's thresholds<br>differ<br>so we need to be quite clear around what<br>that<br>that is and for that to happen we do<br>need to work together no doubt about<br>that<br>um<br>central government regional council<br>uh territory authorities the community<br>stakeholders we all need to to work<br>together on this we need to understand<br>what it means to be resilient we need to<br>make some some pretty<br>tough choices around competing values<br>and levels of risks but we need that<br>statutory framework for all this to fit<br>into and i know there's some uncertainty<br>around those<br>statutory frameworks coming forward so<br>we need to be able to address those when<br>they when they come out<br>but there needs to be a bottom-up and<br>top-down approach the bottom up is the<br>community the hapu<br>the the the mirai coming up feeding this<br>information up but also central<br>government providing the you know the<br>the resources to be able to actually<br>implement some of this work<br>we're on a journey together<br>all right we're all learning all right<br>and we're not there yet all right we<br>don't have all the answers but we do<br>have some pretty good information<br>already we have some pretty good<br>structures and frameworks and there's<br>some new ones coming on with some of the<br>rma reforms that we have<br>so<br>let's build on what we've got<br>and it's really encouraging to hear the<br>previous speakers around what we've<br>already got and where we need to be be<br>with um be it<br>and we already down that track as well<br>and i mentioned before kaya<br>uh and haruki district council are<br>leading the farikawa coast 2120 project<br>that is working with communities and<br>that's been a real success so far we've<br>got really good engagement there the<br>community is getting behind some of this<br>information and changes<br>that we need to implement<br>and understanding at tim's core man or<br>district<br>shoreline management plan work<br>and also wakato district council with<br>waikato<br>so we're in a much<br>better space we're in we've got some<br>we've got great frameworks but we need<br>to keep going<br>and well that's my time but i'm sure<br>there'll be some more chorus at the at<br>the end of this as well<br>so<br>i work for global metal solutions<br>limited um<br>it's a maori business<br>and we're working in the recycling space<br>recycling scrap metal<br>we<br>export<br>about 300 containers a month of middle<br>to southeast asia where it's set to<br>secondary steel mills and it's turned<br>that process that secondary still<br>processing is a much more<br>environmentally friendly process than<br>recreational virgin<br>metal and so<br>we're pretty<br>proud to be working in this space and<br>making a contribution<br>we're also<br>a<br>a business that is<br>not only predominantly maori owned but<br>we also have 80 of our employees in<br>maori<br>and we have been working on interweaving<br>um<br>into our business practices<br>it's a<br>new<br>neat position to be in to be trying to<br>reconcile<br>um you know business practices and<br>business viability and sustainability<br>and profit with practices<br>um around<br>um being sustaining the environment<br>as obviously can<br>and so<br>one of the ways that we do that is we<br>we're trying to set standards within our<br>industry<br>in relation to environmental practices<br>and<br>and<br>one of the ways that we've done that is<br>we have<br>obtained iso accreditations which are<br>international<br>self-imposed accreditations and one of<br>those accreditations is an environmental<br>accreditation<br>um<br>i just want to<br>acknowledge that and i'm really pleased<br>to be able to acknowledge this general<br>consensus that the panel seems to have<br>about the relevance and the importance<br>of um<br>maori concepts relating to<br>the environment<br>um<br>you know as as a maori business we we<br>find these concepts inspirational to<br>help guide us in our decision-making and<br>they they give us a goal to work towards<br>and um<br>you know i max referred to in his<br>corridor about the um interconnectedness<br>of life and that's just such a profound<br>statement right<br>and um<br>for us um working in i suppose our<br>practical industry space one of the<br>challenges that we have is an<br>interconnectedness challenge as well i<br>think and that is the<br>the ability to try and connect our<br>principles and what we're trying to<br>achieve with policy and legislation and<br>and making those things real and making<br>them<br>as important to the people that we work<br>with as they are to us<br>and when i'm referring to the people we<br>work with i'm referring to those the<br>parties that we work with regularly like<br>local council and and central government<br>and those sorts of um organizations<br>and um<br>because it's really nice to talk about<br>these things and we all love to talk<br>about these things<br>but<br>in practice what do they actually mean<br>how do how<br>how do we<br>realize them<br>in a way that we<br>they are valuable that we can say<br>that we can entrench these principles<br>um<br>and into our businesses and into our<br>policy and into our legislation actually<br>make them real<br>um<br>and that's one of the challenges that<br>that we have faced you know<br>um<br>we need more to work with in that space<br>you know um<br>also i think that you know from my<br>perspective<br>there's an issue for us around the<br>importance of tertiary<br>and that<br>um<br>you know<br>and and and that being a basis for our<br>participation as maori in<br>important decision making around these<br>climate change issues<br>and<br>in conversations around<br>initiatives about climate change so you<br>know<br>the inc and this lack of connectedness<br>is<br>um it's confusing and discouraging at<br>times to be honest um when you're sort<br>of trying to<br>to<br>you're saying hey look we're working<br>really hard thought we're trying to do<br>good things<br>but um<br>we use the support<br>because as a business we're about<br>outcomes it's not enough to<br>to have to work to good principles and<br>have these values<br>we have to we have to achieve outcomes<br>and and for us those outcomes are<br>obtaining additional support so that we<br>can expand and improve what we're doing<br>so that we can recycle more material so<br>that we can improve the way that we<br>recycle more treatment out the material<br>make it more um<br>carbon emission friendly<br>and and and then support obviously our<br>whanau and our communities through<br>employment and through sharing these<br>values<br>um<br>we also<br>partner with<br>our whanau in the pacific as well<br>and<br>to help them to manage their<br>waste so that involves recycling scrap<br>metal which we import um here into new<br>zealand and then helping them also<br>manage um<br>the plastics and cardboards<br>so<br>i think<br>it's a bit of a it's a bit of a<br>it's a bit of a i suppose an interesting<br>tension there at times as i i already<br>said but you know<br>the thing is as<br>maori we are<br>we are resilient we already and we can<br>use those skills and apply them to this<br>climate change<br>issue<br>we have been adapting for<br>hundreds of years and we can use those<br>skills to and apply them to this apply<br>these climate change issues we just need<br>i think better pathways or clearer<br>pathways to be able to participate<br>we're fortunate because we have this<br>business<br>vehicle<br>and we're able to generate income and be<br>successful with what we do that opens<br>doors for us<br>but<br>for other<br>um groups in the community they don't<br>have those vehicles<br>and um<br>so i just want to um thank everybody<br>for for coming here today and<br>participating and yeah as i said really<br>pleased to hear that people um<br>are supportive of<br>um<br>of maori perspectives on these issues<br>and really hoping that if we can<br>keep that momentum going that we can<br>start start<br>interweaving and ingraining some of<br>these things into into these spaces<br>where it really counts as i said which<br>is policy and legislation and<br>things like that<br>children<br>uh<br>greetings to everybody it's great to be<br>here<br>um<br>i'm pretty sure that i'm the least<br>prepared speaker<br>in this in this forum today and i'm here<br>because new zealand maori tourism has<br>asked me to be here throughout<br>and<br>i'm here i think to present a a view<br>that<br>uh the tourism sector and maori tourism<br>is an interested party uh in this<br>corridor and in this kaupapa<br>just just like everybody else in this<br>courtyard today is a is a very<br>interested party<br>um and although i'm<br>not well prepared<br>uh here we are<br>and look i just want to say that the<br>corridor up to this point has been just<br>great and if i had<br>prepared well for this um for this forum<br>i think i would have<br>had a little bit of everything that's<br>been said so far in my corridor and<br>everything that's been said so far<br>has got relevance to the way we feel and<br>the way we operate um as a sector and as<br>as a business our own business um i<br>should say i'm sitting out here at<br>company island at the moment<br>our business is a small eco-tourism<br>business based on company island a fardo<br>business<br>where i we're a kaupapa based business<br>we operate our business strictly<br>according to<br>many of those co-papers that are being<br>talked about already today<br>tana kaiti akitana for no natanga<br>rangatiratanga kotahitanga are all part<br>we don't do anything in our business<br>without reference back to one of those<br>tongues that have been<br>ground into us so over the years<br>um but i'm also speaking with an ear<br>and on behalf<br>of another organization<br>that we're heavily involved with and<br>that's an international indigenous<br>tourism alliance<br>and<br>through my involvement with that<br>organization i hear firsthand of the<br>issues<br>and the tribulations that affect tribes<br>in lapland in the usa and canada and<br>africa and south america in the himalaya<br>and of course our brothers and sisters<br>in the pacific<br>which we hear about<br>to a to a much<br>greater and growing level<br>and so those issues from around the<br>around the globe uh resonate really<br>clearly with with us they should<br>actually resonate with us as uh citizens<br>of orbit and also of maori uh across all<br>terror<br>because they're the same same issues<br>that we we're also grappling with<br>um but<br>for for this this copper but this<br>particular copper and i i might go off<br>um<br>off the reserve here from time to time<br>but<br>um<br>for our little business for example<br>we're we're greatly concerned about<br>about the impacts and effects of climate<br>change<br>even in a very localized area like<br>capital island we're seeing the impacts<br>uh through through greater and more<br>severe events of weather dry and wet<br>and of course that that impacts on the<br>environment that we live in we live in a<br>fantastically natural and uh thriving uh<br>environment<br>the is just flourishing and the money is<br>it's it's the best i think in the health<br>at all but we're seeing signs of that<br>we're seeing signs of wilting we're<br>seeing signs of reduced uh water supply<br>we're seeing some<br>change in uh the marine environment<br>we're seeing all those things that<br>you've been talking about today um and<br>over the course of of this<br>prop 22<br>event<br>so they're real they're real things uh<br>they're not they're not not not academic<br>uh exercises for us these things are<br>real just like they are they are for all<br>of all<br>of the all of the globe in fact<br>so<br>i've got some i've made some points that<br>i think i just want to hang my coding<br>around um<br>and and for us for example in our little<br>business it's it's we we focus on<br>um<br>mobilizing<br>uh the collective energy and commitment<br>of our whanau and our extended whanau<br>and our community to do everything we<br>can to<br>um<br>to reduce our personal impact on the<br>environment now i know this isn't<br>um<br>directly talking to the kaupapa for<br>today the the mitigation and uh<br>um resilience kaupapa but<br>uh i i'm gonna say i'm more concerned<br>about<br>uh<br>reduction rather than mitigation and<br>resilience i mean<br>i take the point from previous speakers<br>that we are resilient people we we will<br>make adjustments<br>but not my quarterback really hangs<br>around why the hell should we be we why<br>shouldn't we be<br>going to the source and putting<br>much much more energy into the actions<br>we can take to re to reduce the impact<br>to reduce the effects rather than look<br>look at the adaption strategies sure<br>well we do need to look at adaption but<br>i just want to make sure that we get the<br>the pro rata right<br>and don't move away from<br>um<br>move away from activities that reduce<br>our impact<br>so as i say<br>gathering and mobilizing collective<br>energy uh to help reduce our personal<br>impact on the environment is where we<br>start in our in our little business and<br>our little hapu in a little community on<br>capri island<br>and and the other issue that's become<br>quite apparent to me is<br>understanding that there is still a very<br>very significant part of our community<br>of our whanau of our population that<br>aren't participating in this court at<br>all and they need to be participating i<br>heard that coming through some of the<br>earlier discussion this morning about<br>collective collectiveness and take<br>bringing on communities<br>but look i don't want to be part of a<br>community talking amongst ourselves um<br>we need to be part of it well i want to<br>be part of a community that's actually<br>doing something and i want to know how<br>best to mobilize us all to do that<br>i mean i i liken our our current<br>um<br>that this current<br>uh climate change according or to the to<br>the covent corridor uh we aren't all on<br>the same page and you know in some<br>instances we're not even in the same<br>book<br>for this particular courier we need to<br>be doing something about us<br>so the little things that we we are able<br>to do<br>in our own business and in our own<br>hapu in our own community we do<br>just very basic and<br>minimalistic things like minimal fuel<br>use<br>and we can do that effectively less<br>vehicle use<br>total reliance on solar energy at our<br>facility<br>minimum use of energy hungry appliances<br>all these things that i i'm pretty sure<br>that<br>we all try and do to the best of our<br>ability uh<br>at least the people on this on this<br>forum do that uh and that's great but<br>you know<br>in themselves are just not enough in my<br>opinion<br>we do need to act more not talk more<br>about action<br>um<br>and i have to say i agree somewhat with<br>the thornburg uh caught in all that<br>there's just too much credible and<br>absolutely not enough action to change<br>uh i'm talking about our phone and up in<br>our community uh and our national<br>business as usual model and<br>again<br>in my view it really has to change<br>immediately not uh now i've clocked up<br>75 years i'm pretty happy about that but<br>to to<br>to be able to look back in 30 years time<br>and see us still having the same<br>corridor man i'd be pretty disappointed<br>and if that was going to be the case we<br>just don't have that luxury in my<br>opinion<br>who's going to drive the changes as an<br>academia is it local government um<br>well you probably all say that you<br>you'll have a part to play in that<br>our government approach to me is not<br>meeting the national expectation the<br>government needs to be more undemocratic<br>in my opinion<br>it needs to do what it needs it knows<br>needs to be done<br>even at the risk of a popularity decline<br>it's it's just the risk is just<br>the risk and delaying is just too great<br>to uh to allow ourselves the luxury of<br>more torque<br>are we prepared to make major and<br>significant changes uh i<br>i sometimes uh<br>um despair that we're not i i often<br>despair that we're not prepared to make<br>the major changes that will help us<br>get through this this process with the<br>minimal amount of damage uh to uh to<br>papadu<br>to me<br>the<br>thank you for the proceeding speakers i<br>won't share my slides i'll just share a<br>very quick idea from them and that is<br>that one of the one of the things that<br>we need to be concerned about in terms<br>of resilience is is our tai tamareki our<br>young people<br>and some work i did a little earlier<br>the important thing is hope<br>they need to have hope<br>if they have if they're just driven by<br>fear that will mean that they'll just<br>disengage turn off<br>now how do they have hope according to<br>what what i've studied um it's about a<br>sense of agency a sense of being able to<br>do something about the problem<br>and seeing pathways of action<br>so i think for them to pick up the baton<br>that means it means that we need to be<br>leading with practical and um<br>some of the methods some of the things<br>that you've all been talking about today<br>and uh we we have another five minutes<br>so it would be<br>let's see how it goes if we unmove<br>everybody unmutes and we have a bit a<br>bit of corridor about this pick up on<br>some of the ideas<br>um there was a strong threat there on<br>the value of the natural world for<br>example<br>in both supporting adaptation and<br>mitigation<br>uh marcus talked about the importance of<br>community and what's come through was<br>all the time<br>uh the importance of mataram and maori<br>and informing this not being secondary<br>to science but being a partner<br>yes<br>yeah uh just just um picking up on your<br>comment peter about our youth<br>needing to have hope<br>i i agree totally i think it's unfair<br>to place the responsibility and the<br>burden of the future<br>on their shoulders<br>without providing them with the tools<br>and empowering them<br>in the decision-making framework to make<br>a difference<br>so i i totally agree i think the idea<br>that this coming generation<br>will solve all the problems is really<br>quite unfair<br>said there is another small<br>point about that and that is the focus<br>internationally has been sadly so<br>fixated on the marketplace fixing it<br>with some sort of carbon marketplace and<br>when we move over to our world the<br>biological world it's just a nonsense<br>they haven't been able to get any<br>international price on carbon and<br>they're unlikely to last time trump<br>wasn't here it wasn't at the party and<br>this year we've got uh we've got china<br>and russia out there and so let's just<br>don't we forget about that and get and<br>get on with<br>engaging our tamariki with with these<br>things that we know that we can do<br>you know get yeah what's in our agency<br>and that is those there's community<br>driven stuff and so for me that's the<br>way forward is because there is hope<br>we can we can do stuff<br>one of the challenges we've we've had um<br>as you know as local authorities is<br>engaging with community and we've been<br>quite lucky with with a number of the<br>community groups that we have but it<br>becomes very apparent is to get you know<br>the the full demographic within a<br>community<br>um it's it's the time it's the resources<br>you know people people are busy people<br>have young families they have jobs and<br>then and then we expect them to<br>uh want to be engaging in in these in<br>these projects and<br>um it's hard it's really really hard so<br>we need to have some way where we can<br>engage but also you know how do we<br>not make this process onerous for them<br>as well because that's that's a big put<br>off a lot of people as well as it just<br>it gets too hard and i'm not being<br>defeatist but that's practicality's<br>involved there<br>yeah<br>a good point rick and and i enjoyed your<br>um presentation and good work that<br>you're doing there too and i do<br>acknowledge that it's difficult um<br>and but i think with respect to<br>um<br>local boards and and district councils<br>and<br>local body authorities in general that<br>um there are<br>motivated um<br>cohorts who have resources of time<br>and and some of those are ngatahi they<br>are young people um and so yeah we we<br>need to um encourage you to to<br>look for those<br>and<br>and and then<br>look at developing um<br>their leadership potential because they<br>can they can do a lot communities can do<br>a great deal once you<br>activate them<br>right<br>yeah yeah thank you for that yeah<br>yeah and you know you get a good<br>community<br>panel good community group and and<br>that's the hardest part done i'm just<br>pointing out that you know trying to get<br>these people crowded together can be<br>quite a difficulty sometimes<br>yeah<br>rick you need to just see yourself as a<br>forerunner do this work with us wasn't<br>beginning when you were a child here we<br>were still doing the reverse around here<br>okay they were still spraying all the<br>rivers with 24d so we've moved a long<br>way and to see you sitting there having<br>doing this will work now you get the<br>acceptability of the wider collective<br>political world and the way we go<br>you seldom know you're in a revolution<br>when you're having one<br>there's never been and there's never<br>been a covet<br>covet or a<br>pandemic go through this globe without<br>there being major social and structural<br>change off the back of it and that's<br>what we're looking at milk it to death<br>my man<br>yeah and and we are<br>there is change happening and we are on<br>a journey and and that journey sort of<br>never stops it's just a matter of you<br>know making sure we're picking up people<br>along the way to carry on that journey<br>well kiara that's probably a very good<br>point to close on um<br>dr morgan<br>could i ask you to close this occasion<br>please and thank you again to everybody<br>great session<br>um<br>mama<br>is proud to introduce the world's first<br>bachelor of climate change<br>for the people who know there is no<br>planet b<br>gain the skills
