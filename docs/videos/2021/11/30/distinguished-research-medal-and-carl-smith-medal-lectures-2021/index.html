would like to take this time to<br>acknowledge<br>the loss of a<br>of a<br>former member of the university<br>community about helen duon bart's wife<br>hupia is still an active member of the<br>dunedin<br>creative community does work on<br>verbatim theater but for a long time in<br>her career supported<br>us as a general staff member in the in<br>the depart in the school of surveying<br>um<br>everyone i'm richard blakey dvc research<br>and enterprise here at the university of<br>otago it's my great pleasure to welcome<br>you to this event which is<br>combined lectures for the distinguished<br>research medal<br>and the carl smith medal for which we<br>have the pleasure in front of us of<br>from professor keith gordon<br>professor ben chantal and associate<br>professor john shaver later too as the<br>co-recipients of the carl smith medal<br>we have the<br>recipients<br>pvcs or<br>an alternate for the pvc in one case to<br>give formal introductions to the<br>lectures<br>but as i chair the panel that<br>advises the vice chancellor on the wall<br>of these medals annually i'll first<br>briefly introduce the awards to you<br>their nature and significance<br>so firstly the distinguished research<br>medal<br>which is our highest individual research<br>award at the university<br>which is governed by regulations that<br>state that quote<br>the basis for selection will be<br>outstanding scholarly achievement<br>including the discovery and<br>dissemination of new knowledge<br>the development of innovative technology<br>and or the development of concepts that<br>lead to significant advances in<br>activities of the university it's<br>awarded to work that has been done<br>primarily at the university of otago<br>and<br>pursuits across the university<br>every year all of the four academic<br>divisions are invited to receive<br>recommendations from their departments<br>for the best and brightest researchers<br>research teams<br>and to get references from international<br>referees to support the nominations<br>so it is a very very broad basis that we<br>have the committee deciding these awards<br>it's they're fascinating discussions<br>but unlike<br>other<br>awards like the nobel prizes for example<br>for which there are up to three awards<br>that can be made every year in each of<br>the disciplines we have the unenviable<br>position of um<br>just making one a cr award across all<br>uh<br>all areas uh and we have to balance<br>overall career-long scholarly<br>achievement with discrete world changes<br>discoveries<br>and try and balance<br>disciplines across each other<br>now just putting the scale of the<br>exercise into context we have<br>approximately 1600 academic and research<br>staff at the university with only one<br>distinguished research medal awarded<br>each year since 2004<br>so there are currently a dozen a dozen<br>and a half<br>members of the club of recipients of the<br>drm so that's only one percent of our<br>academy<br>will ever hope to be into this<br>into this territory<br>um<br>also that then is an academy that is<br>highly selective for entry very often we<br>get more than 100 applicants for each<br>position we have<br>into our faculty so there's another one<br>factor<br>even to be eligible to apply for an<br>academic position usually requires a phd<br>or another advanced degree which is an<br>about only one percent of the general<br>population get to that kind of degree so<br>here we are recognizing the one percent<br>of the one percent of the one percent<br>with keith today so uh congratulations<br>keith on reaching that status that i<br>think i could say<br>officially<br>or semi officially that you are the<br>smartest person in new zealand's<br>smartest city today<br>today whether that carries on we'll have<br>to see<br>the other awards that we're recognizing<br>today are the karl smith medal<br>that is also similarly highly valued and<br>involves competition across all of our<br>academic disciplines<br>the medal comes with an associated<br>roe heath trust prize as a cash award<br>that goes along the side the middle and<br>this award was established in 2003<br>through a generous donation from the roe<br>heath trust to quote promote research at<br>the university of otago and give<br>recognition to outstanding research<br>performance of early career staff and<br>there are things that define early<br>career staff of being within 10 years of<br>phd or career appointment<br>but i don't want to leave you with the<br>impression that an early career award is<br>any less difficult to achieve and the<br>level of competition is any lower than<br>for awards like the distinguished<br>research medal<br>i think and we're doing this for the<br>first time of putting the drm medal<br>alongside the carl smith little medals<br>and i think you will see that the<br>levels of achievement and the<br>scholarly effort and the significance of<br>the work<br>is largely indistinguishable albeit<br>covering some very different disciplines<br>um so why is it called a carl smith<br>medal who was kyle smith well carl smith<br>was a prominent dunedin businessman he<br>was the managing director of cadbury fry<br>hudson for many years<br>and also a member of the university<br>council<br>so carl and his wife lady catherine<br>established the roe heath trust in<br>1964 to support the work of the<br>university<br>the trust being named after the family<br>estate of rohith in birmingham where<br>they came from to dunedin the link to<br>birmingham being the cadbury home so<br>i think it's quite apt and appropriate<br>for the the history of this city to have<br>a carl smith medal in a row heath trust<br>award<br>actually carl smith was also a<br>well-known author<br>in addition to his business interests<br>not so much for his book sweet success<br>uh his history of the chocolate maker<br>cadbury fry hudson published in 1968 but<br>also for his quirky and humorous tome<br>called new zealand from n to z that has<br>become somewhat of a collector's piece<br>for its interesting insights into mid<br>20th century artera<br>the book is long out of print but what<br>we do is a special<br>thing for our um rohit trust award<br>recipients and we may have them here<br>somewhere is we do dig out from the<br>regent book sale or trademe or somewhere<br>copies of that book and<br>we may be able to give you one of each<br>one of those as part of the awards that<br>we'll make at the end of the lectures um<br>so atheia that's that's a little bit<br>about the awards and welcome to those<br>that are online listening to this as<br>well<br>let's get on with the show<br>and so i'd now like to invite professor<br>richard barker to come forward and<br>provide the formal introduction<br>for professor keith gordon's<br>distinguished research medal noraela<br>tenna koto tena koto tena koto kata<br>deputy vice chancellors<br>professor sweetman<br>professor gordon<br>fellow recipients ben and john kiyora<br>awesome work<br>friends and colleagues including those<br>out in the virtual world tena koto<br>tenakota tenakota katoa<br>it is my pleasure to introduce our first<br>speaker today professor keith gordon to<br>give this<br>university of otago distinguished<br>research medal lecture keith graduated<br>with a bachelor of science with honours<br>in 1986 and followed this with a phd in<br>1989 in chemistry<br>from queens university<br>belfast uk<br>his phd research was under the direction<br>of professor john mcgarvey and focused<br>on laser spectroscopy of solar energy<br>compounds he followed his phd with a<br>director's fellowship at the los alamos<br>national laboratories in the united<br>states where he worked on ultrafast<br>laser spectroscopy of biological systems<br>and solar energy materials<br>in 1993 we're delighted that keith took<br>up his post and as a lecturer in the<br>chemistry department at the university<br>of otago where he remains today he<br>became professor in 2009 and he is<br>currently the head of department for<br>which i'm very grateful<br>keith was president of the new zealand<br>institute of chemistry<br>uh in 2006 and he is a founding<br>principal investigator in the mcdonough<br>institute for advanced materials and<br>nanotechnology and he's also a principal<br>investigator in the dodd wall center for<br>tonic for photonic and quantum<br>technologies<br>keith is a fellow of the royal society<br>of new zealand the royal society of<br>chemistry<br>and the new zealand institute of<br>chemistry<br>his research interests focus on the<br>understanding<br>of the properties of conducting polymers<br>nanostructured electromaterials such as<br>found in organic solar cells dairy<br>products and pharmaceuticals all done<br>using spectroscopy and he is also<br>interested in computational chemistry<br>it is now time to hear from keith<br>himself who is going to tell us about<br>using light to unpack complex materials<br>from solar cells to krill<br>oil please join me in welcoming<br>professor keith gordon<br>right hopefully you can all hear me uh<br>so thank you very much for those kind<br>words<br>and yep we're gonna just<br>lovely all right<br>thanks a lot so um<br>thank you everyone so i'm i'm going to<br>talk today i'm just going to put the<br>laser laser<br>never a good start to talk so i've got<br>about 25 minutes to try and explain 35<br>years of research so it's going to be<br>reasonably quick and um<br>not hopefully not totally incoherent but<br>i i do have a few things i want to try<br>and get across so as richard very kindly<br>said um<br>i'm going to talk about uh solar cells<br>and krillo but i thought it's kind of<br>useful to sometimes explain where you<br>come from and<br>i i was going to pull out some more<br>photos but this seemed like enough this<br>is where i was schooled this was my<br>primary school in belfast i grew up in<br>belfast and stayed there until i was<br>about 25.<br>and this is my primary school and then<br>my grammar school that i went to which<br>is called belfast ins this is listening<br>shower primary school uh both really<br>good educational establishments and then<br>queen's university in belfast was also a<br>great place to do both my bsc and phd<br>and someone asked me earlier why i<br>became interested in solar energy so<br>it's actually to do i realized that it i<br>i kind of miss<br>i misinterpreted the oil shocks occurred<br>when i was about about 10 years old 10<br>to about 14 or 15 years old but it<br>actually wasn't the oil shock this is a<br>graph showing the price of oil on the<br>inflation rate in the uk<br>and it's actually the inflation rate in<br>the uk that you notice so<br>the oil shock created a spike in<br>inflation and you might think well<br>you're only 11 years old why would you<br>notice that when the price of a bar of<br>chocolate goes up and the price of the<br>bus tickets go goes up that you need to<br>get to school with you do kind of notice<br>these things so that was a very um<br>it was an interesting uh thing that<br>happened uh which really got me<br>interested in solar energy and the thing<br>that's really interesting and it's<br>obvious when you think about fossil<br>fuels is there a limited resource this<br>isn't rocket science it's like if you<br>have a jug of water and you drink all<br>the water there's none left so even from<br>very early stage i realized that<br>solar energy was the most obvious and<br>i'll explain why<br>answer to the problems that we have with<br>our current energy technologies i'm not<br>the first person sorry let me explain<br>why is that interesting so<br>the problem with fossil fuels is you<br>basically just don't have enough you can<br>argue about how long they're going to<br>last sure absolutely they're not going<br>to last for a thousand years they're not<br>going to last for 100 years they're<br>simply not going to last<br>this this energy source which currently<br>pars the planet and part it long before<br>we were here it's going to last a lot<br>longer than possibly our so well<br>probably our civilization is going to<br>last<br>and why is it useful and really it's to<br>do with numbers<br>so the amount of energy we use a year<br>the human race is about 3.5 times 10 to<br>the 5 petajoules that's a big number it<br>doesn't really matter could have used it<br>in different units doesn't matter the<br>energy from the sun in one r striking<br>the planet is greater<br>so it's kind of a no-brained idea to to<br>not think about solar energy as a<br>serious uh a serious um thing to study<br>i'm not the first person to realize that<br>obviously lots of people have uh cm<br>asian and<br>science in 1912 a very fine<br>italian photo<br>chemist<br>said and this is wonderful he said if<br>our black and nervous civilization based<br>in colon oil should be followed by a<br>quieter one based on solar energy<br>that will not be harmful to progress or<br>human happiness which is a rather<br>disturbingly prophetic comment<br>considering it was made over 100 years<br>ago<br>and also thomas edison in conversation<br>with henry ford in 31 said and this is<br>kind of a sad statement i'd put my money<br>in the sun and solar energy what a<br>source of power and this is the sad bit<br>i hope we don't have to wait until oil<br>and cold run out before we tackle that<br>and to be fair people have tackled solar<br>energy it's just not so easy it's not an<br>easy nut to crack<br>again just pointing out the importance<br>of it there are various people i've<br>given a couple of uh talks to general<br>audiences it's always interesting when<br>you talk about energy sources because<br>everyone has a favorite one they either<br>think biomass is going to work or hydra<br>is going to work or geothermal or<br>whatever<br>the problem is the if humanity wants to<br>live the the sort of way that we live<br>right now<br>in 2050 we need to find 14 terawatts of<br>energy<br>an additional 14 terawatts and basically<br>you can't really do that from biomass or<br>hydro geothermal which is a sort of new<br>zealand favorite um is also uh<br>it's actually technically there's not<br>nine terawatts feasible and wind and<br>tide are a bit of a joke especially when<br>you compare them to this number here so<br>all of these are one two ten terawatts<br>this is thirty six thousand terawatts on<br>land<br>not on all of the uh world surface but<br>on land so it's clearly you know this is<br>a good option i think the problem and<br>the real problem the real crux of the<br>matter is that you understand solar<br>cells you have to understand something<br>called an excited state<br>you can call them different things<br>physicists like to call them accitons it<br>doesn't really matter i'll explain what<br>they are in a minute but basically the<br>nub of it is you have to understand<br>something that's a bit tricky<br>so after i did my degree as uh richard<br>said i went to los alamos and this is<br>the sort of experiment you need to set<br>up to understand excited states so<br>you've got a laser you can't see in this<br>picture another laser here yet another<br>laser here yet a delay line actually<br>kind of a pseudo<br>frequency doubling and continuum<br>generation system and a whole bunch of<br>optics down here you need exquisite<br>alignment to actually measure these<br>things they're hard to measure there's a<br>reason the problem isn't solved it's<br>really really hard to understand these<br>types of solar energy type systems the<br>technicality of understanding them is<br>very very challenging<br>and so when i came here<br>to otago i was really interested in<br>these these issues the spectroscopy of<br>electronic materials that included solar<br>cells conducting polymers photocatalysts<br>and oleds and when i was making the talk<br>i dug out this little oled we made in<br>the lab about 15 years ago now<br>and they're really great things to do<br>they're great things to study but<br>they're extremely difficult to study<br>so one thing that you can use is you can<br>use all the innovations that you've got<br>all those experimental innovations that<br>you try and get from studying something<br>tricky to study to actually maybe study<br>you know maybe use them in something<br>that at least the sample isn't going to<br>be tricky and so that's what we've tried<br>to do we've tried to use our innovations<br>in spectroscopy<br>which we've got from what i call<br>molecular electronics that side of our<br>research<br>and apply it to analytical spectroscopy<br>and that that's not to say one is more<br>difficult than the other they just have<br>different challenges<br>but<br>kind of using all that innovation over<br>here to try and drive some innovation<br>drive innovation and measurement at<br>least uh over on analytical spectroscopy<br>and so what can you measure well this is<br>some of the things we've measured<br>microplastics cheese milk powder nectar<br>fruit and veg bone teeth<br>snake teeth which are different from<br>million teeth various other things my<br>personal favorite is rocks or geological<br>samples as i think the geologists prefer<br>to call them and dry peg feces we've<br>actually measured drag pig feces and i<br>guess the joke in my<br>my research group is we'll literally try<br>to measure anything if we think we can<br>get something useful useful out of it i<br>think we can help people understand<br>their analytical uh problem<br>what is spectroscopy so is uh richard<br>alluded to that's what i basically have<br>done for my entire career um and and<br>i'll try and explain it this way so it<br>tells you about the types of molecules<br>you have and their concentration in a<br>particular place<br>how does it work well it's a bit like if<br>you think of a molecule like a tuning<br>fork if i buying a tuning fork i get a<br>note out i get a particular frequency in<br>the harmonics<br>um<br>molecules are like multi-dimensional<br>tuning forks you can think of them as<br>the chord that you might plan a piano or<br>this is actually what it looks like<br>there's a lot more notes but basically<br>the idea is that certain frequencies or<br>energies give signals the signals are<br>either very high or they're very strong<br>or they're much weaker and from that<br>from that<br>the bunch of squiggly lines there are<br>sharp lines however you want to think of<br>them uh you can gain information about<br>the material that you're uh you're<br>looking at and you're trying to<br>understand<br>so the bands are associated with<br>specific vibrations so you can provide<br>information about molecular structure we<br>use a thing called raman spectroscopy it<br>doesn't really matter what it is it's<br>just that it gives a unique signal and<br>basically it's like this so if we think<br>about this is a very simple molecule<br>formaldehyde and you can think of<br>there's a there's a feature here which<br>is due to the molecule kind of doing<br>this and then at the higher frequencies<br>there the bonds are squeezing together<br>we're doing with sort of calisthenics<br>for molecules right exercise for<br>molecules and that's basically that<br>pattern we're able to work out what the<br>molecule is and and how much of it is is<br>present<br>so what about excited states why are<br>they so hard so a couple of wee diagrams<br>it's a really nice<br>super<br>oled technology and solar cell<br>technology is just fantastic in places<br>like korea and china and japan these are<br>world leaders in this area and this just<br>shows these are actually solar cells<br>that have been made into nice glass<br>windows just to look pretty because part<br>of the problem is trying to sell them<br>and get people to buy them and then this<br>one's quite nice this is actually los<br>angeles at night it's kind of hard to<br>see because the screen which is made out<br>of a plastic is bent around you see how<br>it's it's basically a little scroll like<br>a piece of cellophane for those of you<br>who are a little bit older we'll know<br>what i mean by that but it's a piece of<br>plastic you can bend around with a high<br>resolution<br>signal on it and it's also uh transfer<br>can be made transparent<br>so excited states basically involve<br>moving uh electrons molecules are made<br>up of uh<br>atoms and electrons and the idea is that<br>you move electrons from one place to<br>another<br>and we call this the donor which is<br>where the electron came from it's this<br>orange circle or red circle and it goes<br>to the green box which we call the<br>acceptor i'm simplifying<br>hundreds of years work of work but<br>that's okay you get the general idea<br>that we made something different because<br>we moved electrons around and electrons<br>hold molecules together so that's one<br>way of thinking about it let me let me<br>give you a slightly more human example<br>of that so this is my mentor my phd<br>supervisor passed away a couple of years<br>ago very sadly john mcgarvey that<br>richard did allude to and john was not<br>just a great scientist he was a really<br>really good teacher<br>and not in the sense that he was<br>theatrical that's not what i mean he had<br>wonderfully insightful comments to make<br>about chemistry and one of the first<br>ones he made which really stuck with me<br>is to say excited states are just not<br>like the molecule they came from<br>and let me try and use this cartoon as<br>an analogy of that so if we have<br>stickman here and a seesaw<br>and i impart some energy with the photon<br>and stickman was ready for it so he<br>flies up into the air and he goes into a<br>little tuck because that seems a<br>sensible thing as you can do in that<br>situation but he clearly has a very<br>different shape<br>up here than he had when he started out<br>and he clearly has quite a lot more<br>energy and he's also in a dynamic state<br>yep he's not going to stay there he's<br>going to continue to move and if you<br>were able to ask stickman uh how are you<br>feeling he'd probably feel very<br>differently than he did standing<br>confidently on the seesaw so he<br>continues to move and then he eventually<br>plants the landing over here and he's<br>all good again and that really says a<br>lot about excited states there are a<br>couple of things to realize they're not<br>the same as the ground state they're in<br>a very different shape they feel very<br>different if a molecule could feel you<br>understand what i'm saying<br>but the excited states are hard to<br>measure because they're very short-lived<br>and they're also very reactive one of<br>the reasons we like to make excited<br>states is because they can do reactions<br>that ground states can't do and the key<br>things then are energy lifetime and<br>reactivity those are the key things that<br>one worries about in these in these<br>situations<br>so let me give you an example i'm not<br>going to have too much chemistry here<br>but this is just a really wonderful<br>example of much of the work we've done<br>is to try and prove to people that<br>looking at the structure of a ground<br>state molecule<br>doesn't really help it's like asking<br>stickman how he feels when he's on the<br>seesaw as opposed to when he's up in the<br>air upside down yep and so let's take a<br>couple of molecules and we look at these<br>molecules and they're all going to make<br>excited states they're all going to have<br>they're going to have a little dot plus<br>over here they're going to be a donor a<br>hole over here and an electron over<br>there and you can see look i mean this<br>is nice and clean they're close together<br>then i can pull them apart and i can<br>pull them apart and i can pull them<br>apart and i can pull them apart now if i<br>ask the question i have a hole that's<br>where the electron wants to be and i<br>found an extra electron over here and i<br>pull them apart you'd quite reasonably<br>say well obviously it's going to take<br>longer for this guy to get back than the<br>two that are intimately connected yes<br>that seems reasonable and indeed charge<br>separation theory would say that you say<br>oh you separate the charge we're all<br>good going to make a longer excited<br>state let's see what happens um<br>so for the guys who are bound up<br>together they have a lifetime here that<br>means they they're they're up in the air<br>for six thousand nanoseconds six<br>microseconds right the ones are very<br>close together<br>as we go further and further apart the<br>lifetimes drop to four to two to one<br>microsecond in other words as we pull<br>these apart<br>they're collapsing back in<br>more quickly not less quickly more<br>quickly yeah<br>so there's a lovely i mean isagazi moss<br>foundation i think has just been made<br>into a series but i remember reading the<br>books when i was a kid and isaac asimov<br>had i think the most wonderful science<br>quote ever it's the best science quote<br>and it's this the most exciting phrase<br>to hear in science the one that heralds<br>a new new discoveries is not eureka<br>but oh that's funny<br>and this is a oh that's funny mo<br>actually sometimes it's not said with<br>quite quite such a calm way it's oh no<br>what's going on what's happening man i<br>mean we've got the ones that are close<br>together it's a long lifetime this one<br>we tried to spread it out it's a short<br>lifetime what's going wrong but if you<br>analyze it you think about it stop<br>thinking about the molecule as it looks<br>in the ground state and think what does<br>the excited state see the excited state<br>sees energetics that's all it sees<br>you can perfectly adequately explain<br>this using i mean sorry to be a bit<br>technical here but it's called marcus<br>hush theory and it basically allows you<br>to correlate that process so it doesn't<br>matter that it's further away the<br>excited state didn't care it turns out<br>the energetics driving it where<br>less and in the inverted region that<br>actually makes it easier for it to<br>collapse back in<br>seems a bit weird but quantum mechanics<br>can be a bit like that it's just the way<br>it is<br>so it gets worse so this is another<br>example a really nice molecule that we<br>actually shouldn't say i didn't make any<br>of the molecules my colleagues did i'll<br>talk about them later on um made this<br>lovely molecule um it had uh it could<br>give up uh make a positive hole there<br>and put an electron there one charge<br>transfer state or i could put a hole<br>there and put the electron over there<br>another so the two charge transfer<br>states together one called an mlct one<br>blue and one red let's not worry about<br>the the labels and if i put it in one<br>solvent i got one excited state and then<br>i put it in a different solvent and got<br>a different excited state<br>and it turns out that if you do and we<br>did some pretty nice calculations<br>on this quite sophisticated calculations<br>as you structurally change the molecule<br>these subtle structural changes the blue<br>state goes down and then back up in<br>energy the red state kind of moves along<br>and then goes down in energy in other<br>words predictability is not something<br>that you have a lot of you need to<br>understand the excited state not what it<br>looked like before you made it excited<br>so asking stickman at the base of the<br>seesaw ain't gonna cut up<br>and so i hope i've shown there and i<br>appreciate it's very very rushed and and<br>i've left a lot of stuff out but excited<br>states are unpredictable they're hard to<br>get data on that's one of the reasons<br>why they're uh<br>they're we don't have as uh extensive uh<br>predictive uh toolbox but you cannot<br>engineer solar cell materials or<br>photocatalysts without understanding the<br>excited state and that's something that<br>we've really indicated in the last<br>couple of decades so by characterizing<br>excited states in systematic studies and<br>comparing the experimental data and the<br>quantum calculations we've highlighted<br>some of the real issues around that and<br>it's now kind of gratifying that people<br>are<br>really starting to focus on the excited<br>states as a way of understanding what's<br>going to go on<br>so harnessing the experiments and<br>excited states look at analytical<br>problems what do we do there well<br>there's a whole bunch of examples and<br>full disclosure i'm a vegetarian but<br>here we have<br>we've done a lot of studies with the<br>meat industry and one of them is that<br>you can take spectra of lamb venison and<br>beef those of you who are aficionados<br>will know that they're different colors<br>yes i appreciate that but<br>they're not different colors while<br>they're speeding along a conveyor belt<br>and what you guys what i would call a<br>slaughterhouse but you call it a<br>freezing works so uh they're not um<br>they're not so easy to actually<br>distinguish those colors but we can use<br>the differences in these squiggly lines<br>right they look very similar but they're<br>not the same and using multivariate<br>analysis you can actually separate them<br>out and therefore differentiate them and<br>differentiate them in a reasonably rapid<br>way<br>another good example is krill oil it's a<br>great material to to take uh it's uh you<br>know fish oils are generally good uh<br>good for us but krillo is very nice<br>because it has this astaxanthin in there<br>it's an antioxidant it's a nice it's<br>actually physically a red color which is<br>why krillo oil is the color it is and it<br>has this very distinctive spectrum so it<br>has the very two strong features how<br>would they p sorry astaxanthin has and<br>there's krill oil and you can see tune<br>oil which doesn't have any astaxanthin<br>it doesn't have those features and again<br>you can build calibration curves whereby<br>people can measure uh the quality of<br>crop not<br>sorry not the quality i apologize the<br>quantity of astaxanthin in the cruel oil<br>tablet without splitting the tablet open<br>you know you can simply focus your way<br>through it<br>so that's great but you know<br>that's nice we use some of our<br>technology some of the ideas we got from<br>excited state to make make do some nice<br>analytical measurements it's always fun<br>to push it a wee bit further right so<br>one of the ideas that we started to come<br>up with is we looked at the problems<br>that analytical chemistry had and one of<br>them is around<br>crystalline states and so we started to<br>look at what's called low frequency uh<br>roman spectroscopy so these it's not<br>obvious to you if you're if you're not<br>in the field but these numbers down here<br>are very small so these are very low<br>energy vibrations so earlier i said it's<br>like calisthenics right for the<br>molecular molecules doing this so it's<br>doing this this right<br>that's one one type of of<br>it's a<br>mole within the molecule it's vibration<br>within the molecule another way<br>molecules can move is you imagine lots<br>of me in a row it's not very nice<br>thought particularly with this guy i<br>know i'm very very colorful but if you<br>imagine them just swaying backwards and<br>forwards<br>so obviously depending how i'm organized<br>that swaying backwards and forwards is<br>going to be different and that's what we<br>call low frequency remand spectroscopy<br>the modes that are associated with it<br>you kind of shoot it here is this is<br>benzoic acid and i guess the point i<br>want to make is this is a little group<br>we change from this species to this<br>species to this species of the species<br>look how different the squiggly lines<br>are<br>the squiggly lines are very very<br>different but all i did was make a wee<br>change over here and they all bind like<br>this so what i'm trying to say is that<br>very small change made a big difference<br>to how the molecules did this right i<br>put it back back on and suddenly i was<br>doing this in a very different way from<br>i take the backpack off kind of like<br>that and those modes are often called<br>phonon modes but it doesn't really<br>matter they tell you about crystallinely<br>they tell you about the crystalline<br>state<br>we had a lovely colleague ben boyd who<br>came over uh he i gave a talk at a<br>conference i'm sorry he gave a talker<br>conference i went up and talked to him<br>about what he was trying to do what he<br>was trying to do is he was trying to<br>understand a thing called ferroquin<br>which is drug and it was being digested<br>in milk and he was trying to understand<br>it so ferrocone is a crystal so what you<br>can do is you can take your milk sample<br>you can stick it in a small angle x-ray<br>machine and x-rays diffract crystals<br>they don't diffract things that aren't<br>crystals so that's all good you can work<br>it out that way and i said well we can<br>kind of do a similar thing and indeed he<br>was able to do it in our lab with this<br>experiment here so there's a<br>spectrometer there are the various<br>filters we use and the various optics so<br>i mean all up<br>i don't know say 60 grand maybe and and<br>these we bought nice stuff because you<br>know in new zealand it's important to<br>buy nice stuff because<br>it's uh you may have to use it for a<br>very long time<br>uh what we found was that this is what<br>happened with this ferroquin so his<br>ferroquin uh<br>dissolved away in about 10 minutes and<br>this is the experiment he did using<br>small angle x-ray the difference is this<br>is our experiment this is the australian<br>synchrotron where he had to do his<br>experiment<br>now i appreciate you can do a lot more<br>in the synchrotron but you ain't gonna<br>you ain't gonna take small angle x-ray<br>and turn it into a handheld device this<br>stuff here you can turn into a handheld<br>device there's a big big difference<br>technology-wise<br>again just making that point again uh<br>the crystalline states that business<br>with us shaking together like we're in a<br>concert or something like that that<br>turns out to give much much bigger<br>signals than when we're doing our<br>calisthenics right so our kinesthetics<br>are right here are moving together is<br>here and indeed if i lose crystal energy<br>if we might if i get all confused<br>instead of just being in a nice row<br>doing this we all get confused then we<br>end up with this sort of little hill<br>which you can also model you can also<br>use that information<br>so what are we trying to do we tried to<br>do a bunch of stuff because<br>when you've got something new to play<br>with it's always cool to see what it can<br>do so the dissolution i've already<br>talked about we can characterize these<br>different states<br>we can characterize materials in what<br>are called solid dosage forms actually<br>the tablets that you're going to use and<br>i'll talk a little bit about that just<br>to finish up and we also did<br>computational analysis and discovered<br>some nice things about that<br>so one of the things of course you're<br>trying to do something so i'm originally<br>a time resolved spectroscopist right i'm<br>interested in excited state so i want to<br>see how fast can we go right it's not an<br>unreasonable thing to ask it's a good<br>question to ask and<br>this is a study we did where we<br>dehydrated something so this is<br>peroxicon monohydrate in the anhydrous<br>form the key thing here is the<br>structures are different<br>and as far as the law is concerned<br>this<br>oh let me get my arrow back this is not<br>the same as this they're actually<br>patented as different materials so if<br>you have a tablet with proxima<br>monohydrate in it and it dehydrates<br>while on the shelf to the anhydrous form<br>you've gone from being an i'm licensed<br>and legal to i'm not necessarily<br>licensed and illegal and the<br>pharmaceutical companies spend a lot of<br>time protecting and not unfairly<br>protecting whatever they've got a<br>license on or whatever they've got a<br>patent on<br>what we find was we could measure this<br>and incredibly quickly in a few seconds<br>so we could actually this isn't excited<br>states anymore it's just something<br>happening fast so we can measure in a<br>few seconds which is really good we're<br>getting close not quite at video right<br>but we're getting there we're getting<br>there and the all of this data tells you<br>about the nature of the of the molecules<br>and what happens in this case is the<br>little water molecules loosen up slip<br>away and then this reorganization occurs<br>and that's what we're able to show<br>so the last thing i wanted to do was<br>okay so<br>the other problem we have is what we'd<br>really like to be able to do when we're<br>talking about tablets if you think about<br>what a tablet looks like it's a little<br>cartoon of a tablet and it's blister<br>pack there's the tablets blister pack<br>it's actually made up of that's the bit<br>that's going to make you better or<br>hopefully make you better the active<br>pharmaceutical ingredient it's right in<br>the middle it's got a big coating on it<br>it's got a big plastic covering on it<br>for the blister pack what you'd really<br>like to do is to be able to see inside<br>there and figure out what's going on<br>without ripping open the blister pack or<br>snapping open the tablet or any of that<br>nonsense and you can do that you can do<br>it using uh the most the craziest idea<br>ever which is called spatially offset<br>ramen<br>and<br>that is where i said earlier when we we<br>did spectroscopy you always want to have<br>things aligned never tell a laser<br>spectroscopist that i've misaligned the<br>system it's very very upsetting um so<br>everything needs to be aligned it<br>actually turns out in this case if i<br>line everything up perfectly i'm going<br>to measure the the blister pack i don't<br>care about the plastic it's this i want<br>to care about it turns out as i start to<br>move as i start to differentiate between<br>where the laser comes in and where i<br>look i make that bigger and bigger i<br>actually look deeper and deeper and<br>tight inside the sample it's called<br>spatially offset raman spectroscopy it's<br>actually used to work out what's in<br>liquid in<br>the liquids inside containers<br>we kind of put a twist on it we used<br>well hold on our low frequency raman's<br>really good at figuring out this<br>crystallization why don't we put them<br>together and we make what we call<br>sulfur's solf rs and there's two<br>different ways of doing it you can move<br>the laser away that way or you can<br>defocus the laser<br>this way so does it work yep it does<br>so basically what you can do it's a<br>really simple experiment but perverse to<br>a laser spectroscopist is that you focus<br>to maximize your signal that's the top<br>excipient that's the one that's in green<br>there<br>that's a polymer so it's just got the<br>smooth surface<br>and then as i defocus away<br>it's kind of perverse we start to see<br>the the the surface below which is ah as<br>a lactose in this case and then if i<br>focus even further away i actually get<br>the bottom<br>uh the the layer at the very very bottom<br>so we're actually trying to see what we<br>can do with that it's kind of an<br>exciting<br>result<br>that we've currently got<br>so i think i've tried to show it's<br>possible to measure complex materials<br>and interrogate composition with high<br>accuracy it's possible to use low<br>frequencies uh to measure rapid changes<br>in subsurface structure and layering and<br>a lot of those innovations flow from<br>excited state measurements are actually<br>possibly i've simplified it it actually<br>flows from the fact that when you do<br>excited spectroscopy you have to<br>innovate and if you start to do that<br>with analytical measurements you kind of<br>get the same sort of good results i just<br>want to finish up so this is alan<br>mcdermott who a number of you i think<br>hopefully know who got the nobel prize<br>in chemistry and 2000's from new zealand<br>of course and is<br>mcdermott institute of which i'm part i<br>was named after him and i'll had a<br>couple of great sayings so one of them<br>is very famous and you'll all may not<br>all know but it's it's well known the<br>first one that i'm going to give you is<br>not so well known<br>alan said that science without funding<br>is fantasy he didn't always use the word<br>fantasy but he basically said now you<br>ain't got nothing without some funding<br>you need to have funding to do these<br>things and so i think it's really<br>important to recognize the people who<br>funded us over the the past couple of<br>decades the dodd wall center mcdermott<br>institute and institute in particular<br>but also all of these other guys and<br>many different types of different<br>funding sources of course the university<br>as well which has also provided us with<br>really good funding<br>the other thing that alan said is<br>science is people i often he said this<br>of course but he kind of um appropriated<br>it i think is the right uh term because<br>of course<br>much older saying is hija te mea neo te<br>aho hi tangata haitangata hattangata<br>what's the most important thing it's<br>people it is people it is people so the<br>very last minute or so i just want to<br>thank<br>that these are the just a list of the<br>faculty and various researchers i've<br>worked with over uh over the years um<br>and they've been it's really been a pro<br>a privilege and a pleasure to work with<br>them but the people i really want to<br>thank are these guys here so i don't<br>have photos of all the phd students but<br>i got a fair few of them right from the<br>very earliest students back in the group<br>in the early 90s right through to the<br>most recent one fatima just down here i<br>just want a special call out as well the<br>sarah miller dr sarah miller who's run<br>my group basically well i've been hoodie<br>and she's been fantastic and holding<br>things together but<br>a lot of what i do is i mean it's nice<br>to solve problems but it's also nice to<br>work with people who are really<br>enthusiastic and it's made a huge<br>difference to being able to do what<br>we've been able to do and someone said<br>you're the smartest person in the room i<br>i definitely don't think that i've had<br>the privilege of working with a lot of<br>smart dedicated people who've been<br>really really effective uh we've been<br>effective working together so last thing<br>i just want to thank these guys here<br>this obviously not this guy here you can<br>already see him but i want to just thank<br>my family my daughter emily sancom and<br>most particularly my wife catherine who<br>i realized i met in 1984 so she's been<br>basically with me the entire time i've<br>been a serious or even semi-serious<br>scientist so thank you very much for<br>you're a key thank you for that uh<br>wonderful uh expose through through uh<br>spectroscopy materials and other things<br>i am reminded also in your lecture of<br>another famous<br>new zealand scientist who would have<br>said at times if we don't have the money<br>we have to think and so that ability to<br>be able to think about an issue and find<br>and get good ways to resolve it you've<br>also brought to us that wonderful legacy<br>through alan mcdermott i know the work<br>that he performed<br>as one of the discoverers of conducting<br>polymers plastics that could conduct<br>electricity certainly started from an<br>observation that was that's funny or<br>that's interesting seeing something out<br>of a plastic um<br>uh synthesis experiment that looked<br>silver and gunky rather than than clear<br>and plasticky that that that that innate<br>curiosity we shouldn't lead lose and it<br>it it's very clear from your work and<br>the work you've built on that that<br>leads to both<br>important discipline discoveries as well<br>as<br>principles that can be applied to the<br>real world up to and including dried pig<br>feces so can you all please join me<br>again in thanking professor gordon for<br>so our second<br>carl smith award medal<br>today is for uh john shaver and i've<br>already mentioned um many dimensions of<br>of his work<br>so i'll just introduce him by giving you<br>some details of his his career so he<br>studied as an undergraduate at indiana<br>university of pennsylvania in<br>anthropology<br>and then went on to the university of<br>connecticut uconn where he took his ma<br>and his phd<br>completing it also<br>in<br>2012. uh his first academic appointment<br>following that was as a postdoctoral<br>fellow<br>at the laboratory for experimental<br>research on religion at mazaric<br>university in the czech republic<br>uh from august 2013.<br>and this place is widely recognized as<br>one of the leading institutes<br>for the scientific study the kind of<br>scientific study of religion<br>that john<br>does<br>he came to new zealand in the following<br>year as a postdoctoral research and<br>teaching fellow on a marsden funded<br>project led by joseph pabulia at the<br>university at victoria university<br>in connection with the new zealand<br>attitudes and values study<br>and from there he then came to otago<br>in 2016<br>and here he has had a remarkable record<br>of uh success in attracting grant<br>funding uh which has made a real<br>difference to<br>our program and to the division i think<br>for his talk today as we were uh<br>discussing how he might squeeze into a<br>few minutes the wide range of uh<br>subjects and areas sites that he's<br>worked on um i encouraged him<br>not to talk about that but to present<br>simply his boldest and most<br>consequential<br>idea so if you don't like his talk it's<br>probably my fault so john will you<br>please come now<br>and address us on the topic of the<br>promise of a scientific social science<br>i would like to begin by thanking my<br>family i think they're out there for<br>their many years of support and my<br>colleagues in religious studies the<br>university more broadly and<br>internationally for their continued<br>collaboration<br>and encouragement<br>i'm especially appreciative of my<br>mentors rich josephs joseph abuglia and<br>demetrius zigulatas<br>but i would like to dedicate my talk and<br>award to the anthropologist royd andrade<br>one of my former teachers and graduate<br>supervisors<br>when i came to otago in 2016 i emailed<br>roy to let him know that after three<br>years as a postdoc i'd finally secured a<br>permanent position<br>i never heard back from him and roy<br>passed away a few months later i like to<br>think that he at least read that email<br>and that it made him proud<br>when i met roy he was deeply concerned<br>with the future relevance of<br>anthropology specifically but also the<br>general functioning of the social<br>sciences more broadly<br>uh it seems strange to use this example<br>in front of a<br>physicist and a chemist but the example<br>of cold fusion<br>illustrates one of the weaknesses of the<br>contemporary social sciences<br>about 30 years ago a flurry of<br>scientific activity began when a group<br>of chemists reported that they could<br>fuse hydrogen atoms without producing<br>heat<br>this report however contradicted what<br>physicists knew to be the nature and<br>structure of atoms<br>in short the controversy boiled down to<br>this either the chemists were wrong or<br>the physicists were wrong<br>in the natural sciences the pursuit of<br>knowledge about the world is a single<br>enterprise so teams of chemists and<br>physicists got working to see who was<br>right<br>it turns out of course and to the<br>delight of a much younger professor<br>now<br>roy himself was trained in a way that<br>embodied this ideal<br>he was trained at the harvard department<br>of social relations a department founded<br>with the explicit goal of developing a<br>comprehensive theory of human behavior<br>and one that focused on the<br>interdisciplinary training of its<br>students<br>social relations was founded by a group<br>who referred to themselves as the<br>conspirators a group of scholars who<br>formed a new department due to<br>dissatisfaction with their traditional<br>academic departments<br>they included prominent figures in<br>sociology namely talcott parsons in<br>psychology gordon alport and in<br>anthropology clyde and florence claucon<br>and beatrice and john whiting<br>it is noteworthy that many of these<br>figures themselves have been trained in<br>the humanities and medical sciences<br>social relations existed for about 25<br>years and produced some of the most<br>noteworthy<br>social scientists of the 20th century<br>including<br>robert bella michelle risotto stanley<br>milgram clifford gertz and roy andrade<br>among many others<br>according to roy and of no surprise to<br>any academic the department of social<br>relations eventually disbanded due to<br>internal fighting along traditional<br>academic fault lines<br>now what does any of this have to do<br>with my research<br>well roy's intellectual commitments have<br>had a strong influence on me and how i<br>approached the topic of most of my<br>research religion<br>rituals and supernatural beliefs exist<br>in all known human societies they<br>stretch deep into the archaeological<br>record and across cultures religions are<br>structurally quite similar the deep<br>history universality and<br>shared structure of religion suggests<br>that religion is an important part of<br>our evolutionary history<br>and that its study warrants evolutionary<br>analysis and indeed one of the benefits<br>of contemporary evolutionary theory is<br>that it provides a unified theory of<br>human behavior while simultaneously<br>appreciating unique cultural variation<br>a theoretical framework much like the<br>one the conspirators in social relations<br>were hoping to develop<br>but religion is also extremely<br>complicated intricately intertwined with<br>many aspects of human nature and culture<br>and as such<br>understanding its various components<br>their cognitive underpinnings and the<br>relation to society requires employing<br>the methods typically associated with<br>many disciplines<br>my research has used evolutionary theory<br>to attempt to understand the origins<br>functions and future of religion by<br>employing biological demographic<br>ethnographic and experimental methods<br>across diverse cultures<br>today i will touch on a few aspects of<br>this research<br>in terms of ritual behavior in<br>experiments led by martin long and<br>published in current biology we showed<br>that ritualized behavior spontaneously<br>emerges under conditions of high anxiety<br>using motion capture technology we found<br>that people who are stressed engage in<br>more repetitive and rigid behaviors<br>the plot on the screen compares the hand<br>movements of a stress participant on the<br>left with one in the low anxiety<br>condition on the right<br>visible clusters in a are indicative of<br>recurring behavioral movement patterns<br>now rituals<br>vary tremendously across cultures but at<br>their core they all involve repetitive<br>redundant and rigid behaviors and this<br>work demonstrated that these behaviors<br>that is ritualized behaviors<br>spontaneously emerge<br>but rituals occur within groups<br>and humans are not the only animals who<br>engage in ritual<br>indeed at times there are striking<br>similarities between non-human and human<br>rituals<br>for example young men on pentecost<br>island in vanuatu build towers for<br>ritual performance climb the 25 meter<br>towers tie vine to their feet and jump<br>while the community sings and dances<br>below that's the image on the left<br>similarly male bowerbirds annually build<br>tall and highly decorated towers for<br>rituals singing and dancing the image in<br>the middle and much like people singing<br>together on a church on sunday humpback<br>whales periodically join together to<br>engage in ritualistic song now you may<br>object that these are superficial<br>comparisons but a fundamental level<br>ritual behavior across all those species<br>who practice it is all about<br>communication not communicating to a god<br>or gods but to other group members since<br>it is non-essential and not immediately<br>directed towards survival or<br>reproduction how could ritual possibly<br>be a product of natural selection<br>developed in evolutionary biology<br>signaling theory assumes that<br>individuals engage in the costs<br>associated with ritual behavior which<br>are often substantial to communicate<br>important attributes about themselves to<br>fellow group members<br>even though they are costly these<br>behaviors can evolve because individuals<br>materially benefit from the efficient<br>and reliable communication that they<br>provide<br>prior to my work in the area a dominant<br>approach in evolutionary studies of<br>religion had been to approach religious<br>culture as a suite of adaptations for<br>cooperation among unrelated individuals<br>indeed a significant body of empirical<br>data indicate that religious people tend<br>to be more cooperative with one another<br>than their secular counterparts<br>however this body of work downplayed the<br>fact that cooperation doesn't always<br>result in a 50 50 division of resources<br>and that religions often function as a<br>means for those in power to exploit<br>those without it<br>in fiji based on several years years of<br>long-term qualitative and quantitative<br>fieldwork in a village in the rural<br>north i systematically investigated<br>entrenched forms of social inequality<br>legitimized by religious culture and in<br>particular for mission christianity on<br>the screen in the distance you can see<br>the village where i used to live and<br>conduct research<br>my fieldwork led to a series of<br>publications revealing a darker side to<br>religiously motivated cooperation<br>my work suggests that early christian<br>encounters came to reinforce and<br>legitimize traditional chiefly authority<br>augmenting processes of social<br>stratification and<br>inequality that were present<br>present in the traditional caste based<br>social system and today manifest is<br>variation in contemporary ritual<br>practice<br>this research helped to clarify why<br>inequality persists and how elites<br>manipulate costly ritual participation<br>to conserve power in what is still a<br>highly cooperative and largely<br>in subsequent work with colleagues<br>conducted with tamil hindus and<br>mauritius which is off the coast of<br>madagascar we employed field<br>experimental methods to quantify the<br>cost of an extremely costly ritual the<br>comedy<br>and extended the inequality model<br>developed in fiji<br>on the slide you can see the<br>participation in the covety includes<br>several piercings in the carrying of<br>large heavy structures<br>the ritual also entails walking like<br>this for long distances about 10k in the<br>hot tropical sun<br>our study showed that participants<br>relative position in the social<br>hierarchy systematically affected their<br>form of ritual practice<br>specifically we found that low status<br>participants were more likely to engage<br>in participation that required higher<br>physical costs in terms of the number of<br>body piercings as well as physical<br>effort while high status individuals<br>were more likely to use financial<br>capital to present more elaborate and<br>eye-catching signals<br>this worked helped to clarify recurring<br>features of religion and social<br>inequality amongst distinct cultures<br>enabling generalization about key<br>features of human behavior and<br>motivation<br>interestingly in another study in the<br>same location but with data from a<br>different comedy ritual our longitudinal<br>study found that participation in this<br>ritual although incredibly costly was<br>associated with significant increases in<br>mental health and well-being over time<br>but with negligible effects on<br>physiological function<br>here you can see a comparison of a group<br>who participated in a control group<br>who simply walked in the ritual<br>procession without receiving piercings<br>or carrying the cavity<br>the circle on the graph on the left<br>illustrates increases in in mental<br>health from baseline among people who<br>participated versus those who were in<br>the control group<br>in the circle on the right you can see<br>that people who experienced more pain<br>reported greater increases in well-being<br>colleagues and i speculate that the<br>sensory physiological and emotional<br>hyper-arousal involved in strenuous<br>rituals such as the comedy can produce<br>feelings of euphoria and the alleviation<br>of pain via endocrine endocrine adultery<br>alterations in neurotransmitters<br>such as endorphins or endocannabinoids<br>and buffers stress-induced systems on<br>the immune system<br>in other words these rituals can be good<br>for you<br>combined with earlier work these results<br>suggest that low status individuals may<br>experience greater mental health<br>benefits precisely because the social<br>system encourages them to pay greater<br>costs<br>now recently i've been focused on<br>understanding how religion may impact<br>reproductive success despite the<br>centrality of reproductive success in<br>evolutionary models<br>prior to my work with colleagues the<br>link between religion and fertility had<br>not been investigated systematically<br>from an evolutionary perspective<br>this is especially surprising because<br>people<br>because across the world religious<br>people tend to have higher fertility<br>this fact is relatively well known<br>across the social sciences<br>but from an evolutionary perspective the<br>high fertility of religious communities<br>is puzzling<br>humans face tradeoffs and how to best<br>allocate the limited resources they have<br>available to them<br>one critical trade-off is between the<br>quantity and quality of their offspring<br>the more children that parents have to<br>care for the less time and energy<br>parents can invest in each child and<br>fewer investments in a child are<br>associated with poor developmental<br>outcomes<br>studies have documented this trade-off<br>and found that sibling number is<br>negatively related to a child's<br>cognitive and physiological development<br>as well as their socioeconomic success<br>in adulthood<br>we would therefore expect due to<br>differences in family sizes children<br>born to religious parents would fare<br>less well in terms of developmental<br>outcomes than children born to secular<br>parents<br>yet while there have been few studies<br>that compare the success of religious<br>and secular children the available<br>evidence suggests that children born to<br>religious parents fair as well as those<br>born to secular parents<br>what then can explain this paradox of<br>religious fertility<br>we have attempted to exp to integrate<br>two lines of research to propose and<br>test a solution to this paradox<br>first and as mentioned earlier studies<br>consistently find that religious people<br>tend to be more cooperative with one<br>another than the members of secular<br>groups<br>second allo parenting or the<br>provisioning of child care by<br>individuals other than the parents has<br>been shown to positively influence a<br>woman's fertility and improve children's<br>survival health and developmental<br>outcomes<br>we hypothesize that religious<br>cooperation extends to aloe parenting<br>and that the higher levels of<br>cooperation are among religious mothers<br>can help to explain their higher<br>fertility<br>we also predicted that the support that<br>religious mothers received would<br>possibly in fact impact child<br>developmental outcomes<br>in other words we propose the idea that<br>religious cooperation mitigates the<br>in a study with 12 980 new zealanders<br>enrolled in the new zealand attitudes<br>and value study we found that cultural<br>groups with higher fertility<br>specifically maury and pat and pacifica<br>were more likely to allo parent than<br>cultural groups with lower fertility<br>we also found that religious new<br>zealanders after adjusting for ethnicity<br>were more likely to allo parent than<br>their secular counterparts<br>these findings suggest that fertility<br>levels correspond to levels of aloe<br>parental support and because religious<br>new zealanders have more of this support<br>they are able to achieve higher<br>fertility<br>in a more recent article my<br>collaborators and i investigated this<br>paradox further using a large<br>longitudinal database of mothers and<br>their children from bristol uk known as<br>the children of the 90s health study<br>we first investigated whether women who<br>invest in ritual behavior benefit from<br>stronger support networks<br>and increase cooperation among<br>co-religionists<br>over 10 years of data we found that<br>church attendance was positively<br>associated<br>with both a woman's social network<br>support as well as the frequency with<br>which they receive help from<br>co-religionists<br>religious women have more social<br>resources at their disposal<br>aid from co-religionists was positively<br>related to a woman's fertility as<br>expected women who receive more<br>cooperation for members of their<br>congregation have more children over<br>time<br>in terms of developmental outcomes<br>on this plot each colored point reflects<br>a child's test score on standardized<br>tests and administered when the child<br>entered school and again when they were<br>seven and then when they were eight<br>points to the right of the dotted line<br>represent a positive association with<br>test scores<br>and those to the left represent a<br>negative association<br>the first thing to point out is that<br>there's a negative relationship between<br>sibling number and child test scores at<br>each of the three time points we<br>examined kids who have more siblings do<br>the second more general thing to point<br>out is that and this is relatively well<br>known that these tests are biased for<br>example<br>uh a woman's education a mother's<br>education and mother's household income<br>were both positively associated with a<br>child's test score at all three time<br>points<br>the models further reveal a positive<br>association between mother's social<br>support and aid from co-religionists on<br>a child's test score particularly at<br>development this suggests that women's<br>social network<br>networks positively affect child<br>cognitive development and that the<br>greater levels of social support among<br>religious women may help to explain<br>why these women exhibit higher fertility<br>without the same negative effects<br>on children's development as secular<br>women<br>these relationships may also help to<br>explain the resilience of religion<br>across the globe today<br>we are currently testing these<br>hypotheses further with fieldwork in the<br>u.s the gambia malawi india and<br>bangladesh<br>i don't know why but i feel like i<br>should quickly point out that i'm a<br>to return to the analogy with cold<br>fusion introduced earlier<br>our work on the evolution of religion<br>and on religion's effects on social<br>inequality mental and physiological<br>health fertility and child development<br>are unlikely to cause other social<br>scientists to rethink much of what they<br>had previously thought about religion<br>or to check to make sure that we've got<br>it right<br>at the end of his life roy andrade was<br>deeply discouraged by the fact that most<br>theories in the social sciences have<br>become intertwined with western models<br>of morality having emerged from external<br>politics and are thus built upon<br>explicit moral assumptions about the<br>world<br>for example many western social<br>scientists assume that hierarchies are<br>inherently harmful and develop theories<br>whose ultimate aim is to emanciate<br>people from their oppression<br>but hierarchies are valued in many<br>cultures and empirical research suggests<br>that hierarchical social organization<br>can be more productive than egalitarian<br>structures and that the costs and<br>benefits of social organization are<br>different for groups of people than they<br>are for individuals<br>but more moral models don't readily<br>permit counter factual analysis because<br>they assume to know in advance what is<br>good or bad about the world rather than<br>attempting as objective as is possible<br>to simply figure out about the world<br>prior to attempting to affect change<br>another example uh that occurred to me<br>last night was that after i presented<br>the cavity research a couple years ago<br>the otago global health institute<br>someone came up to me afterwards and<br>said<br>those images were pretty graphic don't<br>you think you should have issued a<br>trigger warning before you showed that<br>to us<br>and i thought maybe i should do that and<br>then i remembered that i saw that some<br>research just examined the effectiveness<br>of trigger warnings and i looked at that<br>and that research suggests that trigger<br>warnings either do not do anything<br>or amongst people who see trauma as<br>central to their identity they make<br>things worse so trigger warnings do<br>nothing<br>or cause greater ptsd in the very people<br>they're meant to protect<br>roy advocated that as social scientists<br>we should keep our morals of our<br>responsibilities as researchers separate<br>from our models about the world<br>or else the result result is and i quote<br>very bad science and very confused<br>morality end quote<br>indeed moral models have intended to<br>prohibit interdisciplinarity and the<br>progressive accumulation of knowledge<br>further entrenching disciplinary silos<br>in a review of their historical and<br>cultural development<br>roy recognized that while moral models<br>had become commonplace across the social<br>sciences there were few scholars working<br>with theories and methods that had the<br>potential to encourage the<br>interdisciplinarity that he had<br>advocated throughout his career but had<br>seen all but disappear<br>although he didn't employ evolutionary<br>theory much in his own research he<br>recognized that contemporary work in the<br>area had the potential to be a strength<br>to researchers across many fields<br>indeed my own work has only been<br>possible because of the collaboration of<br>fellow anthropologists as well as<br>biologists demographers neuroscientists<br>psychologists public health researchers<br>sociologists statisticians and religious<br>studies scholars<br>i'd just like to conclude by thanking<br>them and by thanking you roy<br>tina koto katoa<br>john thank you very much for your for<br>your very insightful lectures and uh<br>thanks to all three lecturers i think<br>what we've seen today and actually in<br>bringing the drm and the carl smith<br>lectures together we've seen um some of<br>the value and values<br>of being able to undertake research and<br>teaching at a comprehensive university<br>like otago that that what you've shown<br>us is that those principles that<br>actually in new zealand are embedded in<br>the law in our education act of our<br>requirement<br>to preserve and enhance academic freedom<br>to challenge conventional wisdoms and be<br>critical and conscious of society<br>are values that we hold dearly and that<br>you have advanced in your scholarly work<br>i do look forward to the day though<br>where we can see some of the crossovers<br>into the into the hard sciences and<br>perhaps professor gordon can apply roman<br>spectroscopy to some of your to some of<br>your manuscripts and actually we can<br>think about excited states in a<br>religious sense uh and lead that into<br>professor gordon giving some better<br>analogies for his uh for his the human<br>nature of his work i am though reminder<br>then actually i will just take one<br>moment um to<br>um<br>to think that that the challenges we<br>provide within our discipline shouldn't<br>be blood sports they we should be<br>collegial around their interaction and<br>being<br>a critic and conscience of society does<br>not mean we have to be antagonistic we<br>can be critical friends of each other's<br>and the discipline and of the<br>communities we serve and i do recall<br>hearing a um nobel laureate tony leggett<br>talk about his work to school children<br>he received the nobel prize for uh<br>theoretical work around understanding<br>high temperature super conductivity but<br>his training albeit in the oxford<br>tradition had come through um<br>come through a ba and followed by a phd<br>in theoretical physics he said that one<br>of the things that attracted him to<br>theoretical physics was at the time the<br>discipline was was not<br>like some<br>of the other disciplines that it was a<br>blood sport it was about it was about<br>status but as a theoretical physicist he<br>could put forward<br>concepts and theories that were able to<br>be tested by experiment that he could be<br>wrong without being stupid so i think we<br>should encourage always that idea that<br>we can put out<br>bold ideas and be<br>confident that they can be tested and<br>challenged against others ideas and if<br>that we are wrong then i think in<br>keysword<br>that's interesting that's funny so uh<br>can you please all join me in thanking<br>and um we should move on to the fact<br>that we have to actually present with<br>you your your medals and so i will now<br>do that and first invite professor<br>gordon up to receive his distinguished<br>research medal i think we have a<br>um the the other thing that's being done<br>differently this evening there is a a<br>university-wide awards uh ceremony for<br>the research awards uh teaching awards<br>and general staff awards professor<br>gordon is not able to make it to the<br>function so he gets his certificate<br>tonight as well<br>but i think both uh ben and john are<br>able to come so you just get your middle<br>your book and another little gift so<br>perhaps we'll get ben to come next to<br>medal congratulations<br>last but by no means least john<br>uh finally about before we go just to um<br>just to identify that ritual and um and<br>uh<br>and tradition are important uh we not<br>only build on the traditions of our<br>forebears but we<br>create and enhance new traditions i will<br>close with a karakia our closing<br>benediction<br>the translation of which is to the form<br>of light and the weight of this occasion<br>so let's not take ourselves too<br>seriously so that the spirit heart and<br>body can be light and free as we depart<br>along or above let this all be done in<br>unity so i'll close with that unuh<br>uh<br>thank you very much and all the best for</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
