of you who are watching live<br>stream<br>due to the<br>circumstances in which we find ourselves<br>and those of you who will view it later<br>as we are recording the lecture as well<br>one condition of holding the john david<br>stout fellowship is that the fellow must<br>give a lecture late in the year<br>outlining their project<br>the fellowship itself is perhaps unique<br>in new zealand universities<br>being<br>focused on scholarly<br>non-fiction work in new zealand culture<br>of however broadly defined rather<br>perhaps perhaps than in the creative<br>writing field<br>for which a number of other fellows<br>existed it's named for and is funded by<br>the trust established by dr john david<br>stout who was born in 1925 and died in<br>1982.<br>dr stout was a member of that<br>family so much associated with this<br>university with the law with medicine<br>for science and with intellectual<br>pursuits generally<br>he himself was by profession a soil<br>scientist and a biologist<br>but more than that his scientific<br>interests included new zealand<br>grasslands both native and exotic and<br>the beach forests of these islands<br>he was a true polymath with interests<br>and indeed qualifications in philosophy<br>and also ranged widely across the<br>humanities and heritage generally<br>and the trust uh he created uh in the<br>toward the end of his life<br>to promote and preserve new zealand's<br>cultural and environmental heritage and<br>the stout centre for new zealand studies<br>and this fellowship are of course among<br>the beneficiaries of dr stout's<br>generosity and indeed the generosity of<br>other members of his family as well<br>well this year's fellow nick bollinger<br>whose company we have very much enjoyed<br>is a distinguished musician<br>writer critic and broadcaster he's been<br>a columnist for the listener<br>he presents and produces<br>the sampler<br>music program on national radio most<br>weeks and as well he's the author of<br>three books of non-fiction how to listen<br>to pop music<br>100 essential new zealand albums<br>and most recently his highly praised<br>2016 memoir goneville<br>so without further ado would you please<br>welcome nick bollinger to give the 2021<br>john david stout lecture<br>tennessee<br>in 2015<br>i took a break from my regular gig as a<br>broadcaster and music cook<br>spent a year writing a book<br>which i did as a masters student at the<br>international institute of modern<br>letters just two doors up from the stout<br>research centre<br>my plan was to write the history of a<br>brief yet pivotal period in the<br>development of new zealand music<br>that turned into a book called gonville<br>which was partly the one i'd set out to<br>write and partly something else<br>something more personal<br>than i first intended<br>a combination history and memoir of my<br>experiences as a musician in the late<br>1970s<br>while i was researching gonville meeting<br>people recording interviews falling<br>through archives i kept stumbling on<br>stories that fell outside the project i<br>was working on<br>but suggested another book yet to be<br>written<br>a book about the background against<br>which a lot of the events in gonville<br>took place about this country and some<br>of the cultural divisions that defined<br>it during that time<br>and<br>ever since convo was published in 2016<br>i've been working on that book<br>and this year is the jd stout fellow<br>i've had the real privilege of being<br>able to research and write full time and<br>i expect to complete the book by the<br>time i finish at the start center next<br>february and it should be published<br>later next year<br>it's become<br>the story of what's often referred to<br>counter culture is a term social<br>theorists began using in the 1950s<br>but it was theodore rozak who really<br>introduced it into the vernacular in the<br>late 60s when he identified the<br>emergence of what he called a culture so<br>radically disaffiliated from the<br>mainstream assumptions of our society<br>that it scarcely looks to many as a<br>culture at all but takes on the alarming<br>rosace was an american and had spent<br>part of the 60s in london<br>his 1969 book the making of a counter<br>culture helped what was in many ways a<br>group of disparate elements to see<br>itself as an entity<br>the counter culture as rosette defined<br>it encompassed many different activities<br>political protest<br>communitarian experiments<br>drug taking mysticism<br>and rock music among other things<br>the book was popular<br>especially among those who thought they<br>might be part of this barbaric intrusion<br>or like the sound of it and wanted to<br>by the late 60s the term counterculture<br>was in common use and remain so for much<br>of the following decade<br>the counterculture was primarily driven<br>by members of the generation known as<br>the baby boomers those born between the<br>end of the second world war in the early<br>1960s<br>at the start of the 60s the first<br>members of this generation were nearing<br>adulthood<br>and as the decade unfolded and rolled<br>into the next<br>they would challenge and change many of<br>the things their parents had accepted as<br>social norms<br>the counterculture when examined can<br>seem wildly diverse<br>but two particular issues helped unified<br>nuclear weapons and the vietnam war<br>they both remained active issues<br>throughout the period<br>the atomic bomb dominated the early part<br>vietnam the latter<br>there was a broad agreement that both<br>represented the moral bankruptcy of the<br>dominant culture<br>a world that could devise such an<br>effective means of destroying itself<br>will send its youth to an unjust war<br>such as the one that was being waged in<br>vietnam clearly had something wrong with<br>it and demanded a radical response<br>not that all<br>or even the majority of the<br>counterculture involved themselves in<br>politic in politics in the traditional<br>sense<br>many explicitly rejected the political<br>system as another indicator that<br>mainstream society<br>had it wrong<br>yet the very existence of a<br>counterculture could be seen as<br>political<br>to grow one's hair to live with someone<br>without being married<br>to take psychedelic drugs or explore<br>eastern spirituality or start an<br>intentional community<br>all became in their ways political acts<br>it's by examining the sometimes<br>surprising ways that such different<br>types of actions and ideas were bound<br>together that one begins can begin to<br>see<br>a movement<br>there are other words that are used<br>almost synonymously with counter culture<br>when people refer to the hippie era<br>or even<br>flower power<br>or even that and possibly broad term the<br>60s it's usually as a kind of shorthand<br>for the things that rozak called the<br>counter culture<br>so i'll stick with the term counter<br>culture because i think it's broad<br>the counter culture was in many ways<br>utopian in its aspirations<br>if it rejected the world as it was it<br>had a fervent belief that things could<br>be changed for the better<br>to some this meant dropping out and<br>starting again<br>to some it meant recalibrating one's<br>mind<br>a term that entered the discourse around<br>this time was a change of consciousness<br>in other words<br>seeing and thinking about existence in<br>an entirely different way<br>and this was attempted by a variety of<br>means some of which i'll go into in a<br>moment<br>the counter culture was global<br>though its origins are sometimes traced<br>to the san francisco bay area of<br>california where such visible<br>expressions of counter culturism as the<br>people's parks human beings and the<br>haight ashbury hippie community was<br>centered<br>versions of this movement sprang up all<br>over the world from young dissidents in<br>prague who gather in secret to hear the<br>outlawed music of the local rock band<br>plastic people of the universe to the<br>french students who combined with<br>workers to bring the economy to a<br>standstill in 1968<br>demanding<br>among other things the rights of<br>students to sleep together<br>a classic counter-cultural claim as<br>a catch cry common to all of them<br>was freedom<br>a word that as was demonstrated only<br>yesterday on the streets of wellington<br>by the late 60s you could see counter<br>cultural movements all over the world<br>linked to each other's struggles by a<br>shared repertoire of imagery slogans<br>fashion statements<br>and music<br>this country had its own version of that<br>repertoire with its own distinctive<br>characteristics and that's the one that<br>i've set out to discover<br>so<br>what was there to struggle against here<br>on the surface new zealand in 1960 did<br>not seem like a place ripe for<br>revolution<br>though despite the country's homogenous<br>myth there were both cultural and<br>economic divisions particularly between<br>pakiha and maori<br>nevertheless most new zealanders had a<br>roof over their heads and the number of<br>families owning their own homes was<br>rising<br>the number of people registered as<br>unemployed was<br>403<br>the major cities were growing and farms<br>flourishing<br>families could mostly get by in a single<br>way<br>provided that while the husband went to<br>work the wife stayed home and paid<br>to look after the children house and<br>have dinner ready when the man returned<br>in 1960<br>university intakes were also booming<br>in a couple of years a bursary system<br>covering student fees and boarding costs<br>would be introduced<br>over the course of the decade bursaries<br>would increase and the number attending<br>university more than triple<br>but there was also what sandra coney<br>looking back in the 1980s identified as<br>a strong strand of philistines of an<br>anti-intellectualism<br>with academics and artists stereotyped<br>as bearded sandal beatniks<br>failures when it came to the real<br>business of being a new zealand man<br>and what made a real new zealand man<br>well playing rugby for one thing<br>rugby was perhaps only slightly more<br>than it is now a national obsession with<br>the myth the all blacks were the<br>embodiment of the country's social unity<br>despite the fact that only men<br>participated in the game<br>but when our national team went to play<br>against their greatest rivals the<br>springboks in south africa maori were<br>there was also a national preoccupation<br>of drinking beer<br>although the public bars where most of<br>this occurred were female-free zones and<br>due to an anachronism left over from the<br>first world war all pubs closed at 6 p.m<br>so the hour between five when men<br>knocked off work and closing time an<br>hour later had become known as the six<br>o'clock swill during which time men<br>tried to consume as much alcohol as<br>possible before staggering home to their<br>families<br>such cultural quirks were often remarked<br>upon by visitors from overseas<br>the cold war was underway and new<br>zealand increasingly bound to america<br>and its anti-communist ideology<br>was playing its part<br>any new zealand citizens<br>suspected of having communist sympathies<br>likely to be subjected to state scrutiny<br>which was carried out by the recently<br>also attracting a degree of state<br>scrutiny for teenagers<br>particularly those growing up in the new<br>housing settlements like the suburbs of<br>upper and lower hutt where reports of<br>sexual immorality among juveniles had<br>spurred a government inquiry in the<br>mid-1950s that became known as the mason<br>guard report<br>this report among other things<br>recommended that radio serials should<br>emphasize the message crime doesn't pay<br>and that contraceptives should be kept<br>out of the hands of adolescents at all<br>costs<br>in almost exactly the same moment rock<br>and roll arrived on the scene<br>highlighting the division between what<br>teenagers wanted and the things that<br>were deemed suitable for them by<br>broadcasting authorities and their<br>parents<br>so<br>by 1960<br>new zealand offered a few things for a<br>young person to rebel against<br>even if the main one might have been<br>simply that the place was a bit dull<br>the revolution didn't arrive overnight<br>but more as a series of incursions<br>i briefly mentioned the atomic bomb and<br>the psychological effect that its<br>one of the first rallying points for the<br>incipient counterculture was cnd<br>campaign for nuclear disarmament<br>again this was a global movement<br>it had begun in britain in the late<br>1950s<br>in new zealand it was led by a<br>combination of old communists and left<br>wingers and some of the more socially<br>progressive church people<br>such as the reverend alan brash father<br>but sandy's lack of formal ideology and<br>party political affiliations were an<br>attraction to a growing group of young<br>non-conformists<br>enabling them to focus<br>anti-establishment feelings on a single<br>issue which could be boiled down to a<br>choice between good and evil for them<br>the appeal of politics was essentially<br>existential<br>although c d strove to be seen by the<br>wider community as respectable and<br>representative of a larger group than<br>just the young and disaffected<br>it was in these terms that the<br>establishment tended to portray it<br>covering a 1961 march in wellington to<br>mark the 16th anniversary of the bombing<br>of hiroshima the evening post noted<br>quote the usual representation of<br>university students plus a number of<br>leather-jacketed young men in suede<br>shoes<br>corduroy trousers<br>in 1963<br>a group of young aucklanders formed<br>youth cnd<br>and other branches quickly sprung up<br>around the country<br>in auckland they staged a hunger strike<br>on the steps of a church<br>over the summer of 1964 youth cnd<br>members from various centres gathered at<br>tahunanui beach in nelson with endeavour<br>to spread the anti-nuclear message to<br>holiday makers through folk singing<br>films and puppet shows<br>there they are there's at least one<br>future member of parliament<br>in that photo<br>the most visible of sandy's activities<br>was always the easter march which took<br>place every easter was set out on good<br>friday from somewhere north of<br>wellington and arrive on easter sunday<br>at parliament buildings<br>though there was a concern among the<br>elders of the movement that the marches<br>should present a dignified face to the<br>public<br>some of the younger matches brought<br>guitars and sang<br>and there was a generally lively spirit<br>to the events<br>yet by 1964 the turnout was already<br>dropping off<br>writing in salient at the time<br>murray rowlands one of the younger cnd<br>supporters blamed a sharp drop in<br>numbers on<br>the overriding demand there seems to be<br>on a nice public image<br>he said that arguments about whether or<br>not marchers should be allowed to sing<br>and resistance to what he called direct<br>and positive action such as sit-downs<br>had alienated younger members<br>and though nuclear weapons would<br>continue to be one focus of youth<br>protest generational divisions continue<br>to widen both inside and outside the<br>anti-nuclear movement<br>as young new zealanders pursued an<br>now the bomb wasn't the only thing that<br>got young new zealanders out on the<br>the beatles flew into wellington on a<br>sunday<br>the day on which the country was usually<br>closed<br>the hotel saw available<br>bomb threats and the suicide attempt<br>similar scenes would be repeated over<br>the days that followed as the beatles<br>traveled to play concerts in auckland<br>dunedin and christchurch<br>in auckland<br>mayor dove meyer robinson turned on a<br>civic welcome despite grumblings from<br>councillors such as tom pierce<br>pierce was president of the auckland<br>rugby football union had managed the all<br>blacks 1960 tour of south africa from<br>which maori players were banned and<br>declared that quote if we are going to<br>pander to the hysteria antics adulation<br>rioting screaming and roaring then i<br>think we should make a point of honoring<br>any youths with a sporting background or<br>at least endeavouring to act in the best<br>traditions of the young men of the<br>nation<br>appears as it happens with sandra<br>thousands of school age fans defied<br>threats of expulsion and weight classes<br>to attend the welcome while new zealand<br>tried to understand the effect the<br>beatles were having on its children<br>tony taylor professor of psychology here<br>at victoria university at the time<br>undertook a unique project<br>with special dispensation from the<br>police to access restricted areas<br>he and 10 senior psychology students set<br>about recruiting teenage subjects from<br>the crowds around the airport hotel<br>concerts and local schools<br>he then administered a series of<br>psychological tests in which he called<br>in what he called a search for<br>relationships between their personality<br>factors and social background<br>and their enthusiasm for the beatles<br>in a report that would appear in the<br>british journal of social and clinical<br>psychology he concluded<br>there was no evidence from the hysteria<br>scale hysteria scale of the minnesota<br>multiphasic personality inventory<br>to support the popular opinion that the<br>enthusiasts were hysterics<br>beetlemania he wrote is the passing<br>reaction of predominantly young<br>adolescent females to group pressures of<br>such a kind that meets their special<br>but<br>perhaps<br>even better place to explain the<br>enthusiasm and special emotional needs<br>would be a young adolescent female<br>writing to the dominion as beagle fan<br>and nine thousand six hundred and twelve<br>of wage town<br>one young adult adolescent female<br>hero<br>maybe the deep down reason is<br>frustrations and tensions but my reason<br>is simply because screaming is enjoyable<br>the beatles have all the vital<br>ingredients necessary for good screaming<br>lots of noise a loud beat other<br>screamers and encouragement so you can<br>let yourself go and scream as much as<br>you like<br>anyway where else can you scream have a<br>the 15 year old writer of that letter as<br>i discovered during my research<br>was one rachel stace<br>who told me<br>that she'd had a number of adventures<br>during the beatles visit including<br>talking away past the doorman at the<br>town hall to see the group's second<br>concert even though she didn't have a<br>ticket and being escorted by police from<br>a fire escape outside the st george<br>hotel after an unsuccessful attempt to<br>the beatles audience may have been<br>dominated by young women but they also<br>offered a kind of liberation to the new<br>zealand male<br>by defying the popular image of<br>masculinity<br>they were skinny and long-haired at a<br>time when longhair term originally<br>coined for dead classical composers<br>still meant defeat intellectuals<br>basically they were the opposite of<br>the beatles were themselves ultimately<br>shaped by the counterculture at least as<br>much as it was shaped by them<br>over the next few years they would be<br>early adopters of most significant<br>counter cultural trends which they would<br>transmit to all corners of the world new<br>zealand included via the massive<br>telegraph system of their music<br>yet even when beatlemania was still in<br>its infancy the cultural reverberations<br>were inescapable<br>it was hard to deny their radiant<br>harmonies<br>their working class wit<br>the new zealand broadcasting corporation<br>had no choice but to play their records<br>and happily complied<br>in the end everybody was a little bit of<br>a beatles fan<br>which<br>could not necessarily be said for other<br>british bands that turned the beatles<br>wake<br>the rolling stones and the pretty things<br>both of whom visited in<br>1965 didn't bother with the harmonic<br>sweetenings witty rip our tea or tidy<br>uniforms<br>they were hairy and scary looked like<br>layabouts and drew heavily on the black<br>american blues lending a london leah to<br>the music's inherent sex and swagger<br>the stones had begun to augment their<br>blues covers with originals that<br>expressed even more directly their<br>cynical view of modern society summed up<br>in songs like i can't get no<br>satisfaction<br>on stage they defied social norms in<br>other ways<br>phil gifford recalled to me their first<br>concert in auckland in 1965 he said<br>when the curtains parted there were four<br>stones playing twice as loud as i'd ever<br>heard a band play before and the fans<br>started screaming<br>then they went totally crazy when mick<br>jagger appeared rattling maracas into<br>his heel toe and back again sideways<br>dance across the stage<br>when he got to keith richards he leaned<br>in and kissed him on the cheek<br>and for a couple of stunned weird<br>seconds the girls stopped an astonished<br>mid-screen<br>it was 1965 and in new zealand we didn't<br>do androgyny it took a song or two<br>before the fans were back to full volume<br>again<br>though not nearly as famous as the<br>beatles or stones and nowhere near their<br>league as songwriters the pretty things<br>nevertheless rivaled both groups in<br>terms of how much publicity they were<br>able to generate during their short stay<br>thanks mostly to the extra musical<br>a little older than the rest of the<br>group<br>he was a drunk surrealist and an<br>outrageous clown<br>between shows he would rampage about<br>sleeping new zealand streets<br>dressed in a bed spread a leopard skin<br>pillbox hat and brandishing a light bulb<br>it was taken in christchurch in the<br>early hours one morning<br>by the drummer the new zealand drummer<br>and the span that supported them in<br>their turn<br>he disrupted the other acts on the<br>touring bell he drank alcohol out of a<br>boot he lit fires in provincial theaters<br>to newspaper reporters hoping to<br>scandalize their readers he was a<br>willing conspirator<br>he co-conspirator for the fortnight that<br>they were in the country the pretty<br>things were just constantly in the<br>headlines<br>when the time finally came for the<br>things to depart pan-american officials<br>evicted prince from the plane for being<br>intoxicated forcing him to spend a<br>further night in new zealand<br>the last images of him in this country<br>shown in an airport lounge beating a<br>tampering<br>and waving a large crayfish<br>but the pretty things auckland town hall<br>concert also happened to provide a<br>recruitment opportunity for a new<br>organization that was just starting to<br>make itself known<br>the auckland pym they began august 1965<br>at a meeting of two dozen or so people<br>all in their teens and early twenties<br>roughly half were students the remainer<br>blue collar workers and apprentices<br>the pretty things arrival that same<br>month saw the newly formed organization<br>parading outside the venue with posters<br>and successfully recruiting some of the<br>young fans fans to their ranks<br>as the fledgling political group grew<br>tertiary students tended to drop out and<br>the proportion of young workers<br>apprentices and secondary school<br>students increased<br>initially they called themselves youth<br>action committee on vietnam<br>as their interests widened over the next<br>few months the name became auckland<br>progressive youth with movement added<br>some time later<br>talking to paul jackman in 1979 for his<br>thesis on the vietnam war movement in<br>auckland<br>founding member anna lee said it was<br>clear that once you start questioning<br>one issue such as new zealand being<br>involved in the war you start running<br>into all kinds of interconnected things<br>incited big business american financial<br>interests and the relationship between<br>the police and the status quo and other<br>areas of concern<br>as jackman would observe when the pym<br>what the pym emphasized was the<br>radicalization and mobilization of young<br>the pym had gleaned from the worldwide<br>media coverage of the black civil rights<br>movement in america<br>that protest acts generated the greatest<br>publicity when they were met with<br>violence<br>so when the south vietnamese leader air<br>vice marshal key arrived at maori<br>airport in 1966<br>one of a series of visitors who came to<br>encourage new zealand's contribution to<br>the vietnam war<br>it was a pym member john gavilinsky who<br>committed the first major act of protest<br>by throwing himself in front of key's<br>car<br>he was quickly apprehended by police but<br>the event was captured by television<br>news cameras<br>talking to jackman about the incident 12<br>years later koblinski recalled that when<br>he'd arrived at work the next day he was<br>surrounded by his workmates who'd seen<br>him being manhandled on television and<br>now agreed that all the things he'd been<br>telling them about the relationship<br>between the police and the status quo<br>must be right<br>gablinski's interpretation of the value<br>of such an act was a typical example of<br>pym thinking<br>such headline grabbing stunts would<br>change the public face of protest along<br>with strategies borrowed from the<br>international protest movement such as<br>sit downs or<br>sit-ins<br>teach-ins<br>and the development of an underground<br>media<br>all of this both reflected and fed into<br>a virgin and counterculture that was<br>it was clear that the pym was cut from a<br>different cloth from the middle-class<br>student-led youth cnd<br>although different pym sprung up in<br>different parts of the country with<br>little coordination<br>between them<br>the wellington poam for instance had a<br>much more of a student base and presence<br>on campus<br>in christchurch the pym was a student<br>worker alliance but while it would be<br>fair to say that the

psychological<br>and for some the source of those<br>imaginings and the gateway to them was<br>drugs<br>the use of marijuana amplified the sense<br>of otherness that already existed among<br>the counter-cultural crowd<br>not least because it was illegal<br>added to their questioning of such<br>beliefs as the necessity of war or the<br>sanctity of the nuclear family and<br>removed them even further from the rugby<br>beer and home improvement society from<br>which they'd already felt estranged<br>its effects were so markedly different<br>from those of alcohol that drinkers<br>became an

would mutter as<br>they contemplated some aspect of the<br>straight world with their freshly<br>rearranged synapses or registered some<br>small curious coincidence the<br>significance of which appeared magnified<br>but an even more profound influence was<br>lsd<br>in new zealand's medical world some<br>psychiatrists have been using this<br>hallucinogenic drug sometimes<br>called psychedelic drug<br>in treatment programs since the early<br>60s<br>in the october 1966 edition of the new<br>zealand medical journal dr david<br>livingston of calvary private hospital<br>in christchurch wrote

1967<br>government authorities had begun a<br>campaign against the drug taking its cue<br>from british and american responses and<br>bolstered by lurid newspaper stories<br>from overseas<br>an lsd

degeneracy<br>many young new zealanders had already<br>begun to live their lives in ways that<br>diverged radically from those of their<br>parents before drugs entered the picture<br>one of those young new zealanders ken<br>james told me<br>until the early 1970s drugs were very<br>hard to come by<br>most of us formed our views before their<br>arrival<br>i believe that drugs had more influence<br>on those who didn't take them<br>who realized that their thinking in<br>their way of life was under threat<br>which it was<br>one visible flowering of this lifestyle<br>was the rock festival or happening which<br>brought together various manifestations<br>of the counter culture including drugs<br>and sex but also things like<br>yoga workshops<br>krishna meditation and vegetarian food<br>all around the unifying element of rock<br>music<br>the rock festival wasn't something new<br>zealanders were immediately good at<br>the first festival of this kind redwood<br>70 took place in january 1970 just a few<br>days after the new zealand visit of us<br>vice president spyro agnew which had<br>seen violent confrontations between<br>and redwood 70 also erupted into<br>violence on the

people for three<br>days<br>in part its success at least in terms of<br>its atmosphere<br>seems to have stemmed from a<br>light-handed approach to security<br>much of this task was undertaken by eden<br>security a predominantly maori firm run<br>by hugh lim<br>a former child tap dancing champion and<br>gogo dance instructor whose first<br>venture into security provision had been<br>during the

that<br>stuff we'd go out of our way to look<br>absolutely gorgeous<br>often she added they didn't wear any<br>clothes at all<br>closely related to the communal flat but<br>with some distinct characteristics of<br>its own was the crash pad<br>a property rented or perhaps squatted<br>with an unfixed roster of residents<br>some occupants would be semi-permanent<br>others might stay a night a week or<br>month<br>crashers had usually learned about the<br>place by word of mouth their turn up<br>unannounced perhaps offering the name of<br>some shared acquaintance by way of<br>reference and sleep wherever they could<br>find available space<br>around the country other kinds of<br>communities were beginning to take shape<br>more expansive than flats more organized<br>than crash pads in december 1971 a<br>journalist of the evening post visited a<br>country house in taitupu<br>20 kilometers out of christchurch<br>where a group of 17 to 20 year olds had<br>formed a commune<br>the group were remnants of the<br>winchester commune an urban community<br>founded on anarchist principles who'd<br>gone rural after being evicted from<br>their christchurch central christchurch<br>premises<br>the commune was based on sharing a 17<br>year old community explained<br>we do casual work the money we get goes<br>into a turn we all live out of the tin<br>sometimes we do go short but when that<br>happens we all budget and we all help<br>the most publicized commune in this<br>period was the one founded by the poet<br>and social critic james k baxter<br>for many years he'd been venting his<br>views on society's ills in poetry and<br>polemics<br>while in many ways he was an anomalous<br>figure in the counterculture<br>wrong generation wrong religion he was a<br>catholic convert<br>wrong temperament<br>and there was no comparable figure in<br>the international movement he certainly<br>provided the counter culture in this<br>country with a very public face<br>by 1970 he left his family in nioh shed<br>his shoes<br>that his hair and beard grow so he<br>looked like a cross between a hippie a<br>homeless person and an old testament<br>prophet and gone to jerusalem on the<br>upper reaches of the whanganui river<br>where amanda joining a catholic mission<br>station at the maori community he<br>attempted to set up a commune of his own<br>with the aim of providing a refuge for<br>young people who were burned out either<br>by drugs or mental health issues arising<br>from the pressures of mainstream society<br>baxter's jerusalem may have been<br>therapeutic for some but was hardly<br>utopian<br>in the words of one medium-term resident<br>it wasn't a commune it was a rural crash<br>pad<br>but in other parts of the country<br>variations on this model spring up not<br>all of them centered on a charismatic<br>leader like baxter<br>the founders and inhabitants of the<br>communes represented a range of<br>intentions<br>there were those who were attracted by<br>ideals of self-sufficiency and living<br>sustainably and harmony with the<br>environment<br>they farmed grew things and built<br>elaborate shelters<br>some developed crafts such as pottery<br>and weaving<br>some sought an alternative way to raise<br>their children other than a suburban<br>nuclear family<br>some went to have sex with a lot of<br>different people<br>some wanted to be left alone to take<br>drugs<br>remote rural locations provided<br>opportunities for the clandestine<br>cultivation of cannabis<br>the police it was hoped would be many<br>valleys away<br>somewhere to be closer to god<br>that one commune sunburst<br>some of the members followed the teenage<br>indian guru maharaja while the sunday<br>creek commune was for a period almost<br>entirely made up of orange-clad<br>it was around about this time on a<br>hokianga back road that an encounter<br>took place between a member of the<br>counter-culture and a member of<br>parliament<br>in early summer 1972 the general<br>election campaign was underway and<br>martial rata mp for northern maori was<br>on the campaign trail<br>with him in his chevrolet impala were<br>two helpers both maori like himself<br>all three wearing suits<br>they were hot uncomfortable and in a<br>hurry<br>moving slowly towards them came a figure<br>on horseback dressed only in what<br>appeared to be a kind of loincloth<br>he was an american and had spent the<br>past couple of years subsisting on a<br>remote piece of land<br>for rata it was both a paradox and an<br>epiphany<br>here they were three maori sweltering<br>suits in this ostentatious american car<br>while the barely clad pakia seemed<br>comfortable<br>and different with all the time in the<br>world apparently living a life more akin<br>to that of pre-colonial maori<br>over the next year rata would devise a<br>scheme for making cracks of crown land<br>available for a peppercorn fee to any<br>young people wanting to start their own<br>communities<br>and it will be taken up with alacrity by<br>the newly elected labour prime minister<br>though kirk could hardly have been<br>mistaken for a hippie<br>he shared some of the counter culture's<br>distaste for materialism and wish for<br>more communal values<br>the oahu scheme as it became known<br>meaning communal working group<br>appeal to kirk as quote<br>an antidote to the ills of modern<br>society as well as a means of showing<br>people the virtues of a simpler life<br>maturata addressing the oahu working<br>party in august 1974 enlarged on this<br>point of view he said<br>the over emphasis on the gross national<br>product perpetual greed speculation<br>profiteering unethical practices and the<br>cult of individualism can only result in<br>the further alienation of those who seek<br>a return to community and group feelings<br>i share with other government members<br>the hope that the ohu will in some way<br>lead the way to a more concerned society<br>and recapture and you the deep links of<br>yet despite the enthusiasm of rata kirk<br>and some other government members<br>there was opposition at lower levels of<br>bureaucracy that would ultimately<br>undermine them<br>federated farmers which had a<br>representative on the ohu advisory<br>committee vocally criticized the scheme<br>if the idea of small communities of<br>artisans springing up in the wilderness<br>appeal to kirk it horrified some of the<br>county councils who blocked building<br>consents<br>and there was the ill-preparedness of<br>some of the communists themselves many<br>of whom had urban upbringings and often<br>little idea of how to actually survive<br>on the land<br>still<br>the election of norman kirk as prime<br>minister in november 1972 did in many<br>ways see the mainstreaming for the first<br>time of counter-cultural ideas yoho<br>scheme being just one of them<br>it might not have been the dawning of<br>the age of aquarius but after 12 years<br>of national party rule<br>it must have almost felt like it<br>in the brief time he would spend as<br>prime minister for his election until<br>his sudden death 21 months later<br>kurt showed he was at least curious<br>about what younger citizens had to say<br>he ordered the rugby union to call off a<br>new zealand tour by the springboks<br>dispatched a frigate to sail to<br>atoll to protest french nuclear tests<br>and halted nationals planned to rise<br>raise the level of lake manapuri<br>in each of these acts addressing one or<br>more of the causes that had come to be<br>associated with the counter culture<br>whether it was communalism the<br>environment calls for peace<br>or equality<br>and labor introduced the domestic<br>purposes benefit a social welfare<br>payment given to single parents with<br>dependent children<br>this acknowledgment that the nuclear<br>family was not the only social unit<br>the child-rearing was important work and<br>handling of some degree of and the<br>handing of some degree of autonomy to<br>young women<br>represented a major shift in social<br>thinking<br>but<br>other forces were messing against the<br>counter culture and some of them<br>well the use of marijuana along with<br>long hair and rock music head by the<br>mid-70s spread through mainstream new<br>zealand among the counter-culture other<br>kinds of drugs were becoming more common<br>opiates had been used by a small number<br>of new zealanders in the 60s<br>but around 1974<br>a former menswear salesman called marty<br>johnston and a safecracker receiver and<br>occasional police informer called terry<br>clark<br>teamed up<br>first to import from asia massive<br>amounts of a particularly strong<br>marijuana known as buddha<br>then to branch into heroin<br>the ideal product for a capitalist<br>paradigm<br>as its addictive nature and the<br>increasing amounts needed as the user's<br>tolerance develops ensures an ongoing<br>and growing demand<br>when suppliers are scarce<br>some resort to crimes such as burglary<br>preoccupied with maintaining their<br>supply addicts are drawn to others with<br>the same need<br>so while in some ways heroin could be<br>considered to be the most counter<br>cultural of drugs and that its user can<br>appear to have completely rejected the<br>cultural values of the mainstream<br>it also created an isolated subculture<br>within the counter culture one which<br>ultimately contributed to its<br>disintegration<br>it would be simple and convenient to say<br>that heroin killed the counterculture of<br>fatal accidental overdose<br>clerk and johnson certainly made their<br>special contributions to the counter<br>culture's decline<br>yet looking back<br>there are other signs and reasons why it<br>as we've seen<br>by 1975 many of the things the 60s<br>rebels have laid themselves on the line<br>for have been absorbed into the life of<br>middle new zealand<br>counter-cultural signifiers no longer<br>automatically linked a person to a<br>string of radical causes<br>to all intents and purposes the vietnam<br>war was over so having long hair and<br>smoking marijuana no longer identified<br>you as someone who would also in all<br>likelihood be against war<br>the number of people going to church or<br>identifying themselves as religious had<br>declined steadily between 1960 and 1975.<br>christian morality was no longer much of<br>a deterrent to drug taking or premarital<br>sex<br>contraception was becoming easier to<br>require<br>while on the one hand these things might<br>be taken as signs that the counter<br>culture had triumphed<br>in another way they created a vacuum<br>which emergent forces would come to<br>exploit<br>the 60s had provided ideal conditions<br>for the counter-cultural experiment<br>the affluence of the era had enabled an<br>unprecedented number of young people to<br>leave home and experience a life with<br>very few restrictions<br>casual work cheap accommodation and a<br>culture of sharing kept them from<br>poverty while they considered global<br>injustices<br>or appreciated the finer qualities of<br>behind the tourist office in<br>somewhere in pakistan<br>some spent time<br>on the so-called hippie trail traveling<br>overland through asia and europe in<br>pursuit of spiritual enlightenment or<br>cheap drugs<br>some went to university where without<br>paying fees or incurring debt they could<br>spend much of the academic year engaged<br>in extracurricular activities of one<br>kind or another<br>the campuses were loci for teach-ins and<br>happenings but there are other centres<br>of counter culture counter-cultural<br>activity as well in pubs parks crash<br>the uh<br>australian feminist and<br>counter culturist<br>with<br>sharon sederman and santorini and sue<br>cajlee the<br>founding members of women's liberation<br>in new zealand<br>um and<br>germain grier was amongst the first to<br>recognize<br>that<br>the counter-cultural way of life was<br>unsustainable<br>in 1972 just a few months after a<br>controversial visit to new zealand she<br>wrote<br>the hippie is the sign of surplus value<br>the dropout can only claim sanctity in a<br>society which offers something to be<br>for others the first hint that the era<br>was coming to an end was the<br>international oil shock of the following<br>year<br>which in combination with the gradual<br>decline in exports tipped the country<br>into economic recession<br>persuaded that a national government<br>would be better equipped to manage the<br>crisis than labour who had lost their<br>leader norman kirk in 1974<br>the country elected national to power in<br>1975<br>and robert muldoon became prime minister<br>it's a sea of muldoons from a magazine<br>sort of one of the<br>cornerstones of the countercultural<br>press in new zealand and<br>been very useful to me as a sort of time<br>capsule<br>of<br>what people were thinking about at the<br>time<br>and the collage was done by the earwix<br>for others the first hint that the era<br>was coming to an end was the<br>international oil shock<br>oh we've had that<br>inflation<br>and unemployment slowly rose<br>while income stagnated as muldoon tried<br>to soften the blow with overseas<br>borrowing<br>well doom was certainly no fan of<br>protesters drug takers hippies and oahu<br>schemes though ironically this<br>the economy may have helped prolong<br>their viability<br>ultimately though it became far more<br>difficult to support a counter-cultural<br>lifestyle and while some certainly<br>continued to do so<br>they would move further and further to<br>the margins of society<br>this economic change also coincided with<br>the turn of the generational wheel<br>in 1975 the first of the baby boomers<br>born in 1945<br>turned 30<br>having devoted their teens and 20s to<br>challenging the role of their parents<br>many were now parents themselves and<br>trying to figure out what rules might<br>actually be required for their own<br>survival<br>they'd enjoyed many privileges their<br>parents never had<br>shelter mobility affordable education<br>work when they wanted it leisure if they<br>preferred<br>that had the time and means to ask<br>questions and it seemingly questioned<br>everything except their own good luck<br>and it should be noted here if i haven't<br>already made it apparent that the<br>counter culture drew predominantly<br>though not exclusively from the pakistan<br>though their produce cries that<br>sometimes made them sound like victims<br>of a totalitarian regime they had<br>enjoyed considerable freedoms<br>when these privileges were threatened by<br>changes in the country's economic<br>fortunes some went back and finished<br>their degrees joined the family firm and<br>got on with their middle class lives and<br>probably still smoked dope on the<br>weekends<br>the countercultural male had been the<br>most privileged of all<br>though some<br>men had led support to the idea of<br>women's liberation which in its early<br>stages had close links to the<br>counterculture sharing printing<br>facilities with the underground papers<br>holding their meetings in urban communes<br>or radical bookshops<br>in reality few men were moved to make<br>the substantial changes women's<br>liberation required of them<br>comfortable with their masculine<br>prerogatives there was a reluctance to<br>share or relinquish power<br>some took their entitlements into<br>alternative spaces such as the communes<br>where in many cases women were expected<br>to take care of children and domestic<br>as the 70s unfolded the women's movement<br>tended to turn away from alternative<br>communities<br>and focus on trying to change existing<br>institutions<br>not the alternative communities ended<br>there<br>in 1975 many communes were only just<br>getting started<br>yet as each one strived to define itself<br>the connection to a wider idea of a<br>counter culture was sometimes lost<br>in her study of four intentional<br>communities in new zealand olive jones<br>noted that many would gradually break up<br>into separate households cooperative<br>activity would become inconsistent and<br>that that initial utopian idealism was<br>gradually replaced by the desire for a<br>comfortable lifestyle<br>eventually some communes would seem<br>little different than a friendly rural<br>suburb<br>as the founding populations grew older<br>the younger members of the communities<br>looking back today<br>the counterculture might seem to be<br>rhythm of paradoxes<br>there were visions of nuclear apocalypse<br>and dreams of a utopian future<br>a belief that society could be changed<br>and yet a simultaneous retreat from<br>society<br>ideas of tolerance diversity and<br>acceptance yet white middle-class men<br>predominated<br>an emphasis on large collective projects<br>protest marches communal living<br>experiments happenings and festivals<br>and yet the individual experience was so<br>to the

characterized the<br>inwardly directed activities of the<br>counter-culture as narcissistic<br>to the left-wing commentator bruce<br>jessen writing in the mid-80s the<br>political discourse during the<br>counter-cultural era even when it looked<br>outward had been focused on the wrong<br>things<br>the 60s should have been a time of<br>questioning the direction of new zealand<br>society he wrote

nuclear<br>annihilation<br>almost immediately the fourth labor<br>government enacted a number of reforms<br>that acknowledge such campaigns<br>they established a ministry of women's<br>affairs to

shayna lang wrote the upbeat<br>anthem neutral and nuclear free<br>in celebration<br>it seemed<br>as though all the counter cultures calls<br>for freedom we're finally being heeded<br>at the highest levels of power<br>but for those boomers now in government<br>freedom came in many forms<br>and along with their support for a freer<br>society can their demand for a freer<br>economy<br>we know what happened<br>a few people made a lot of money<br>a lot of people lost jobs and would<br>never again have the security of regular<br>work and income<br>by the end of the decade ten percent of<br>the population<br>and a quarter of all maori were<br>unemployed<br>and yet<br>while no success of government whether<br>labor or national lead has ever really<br>reversed those neoliberal reforms<br>neither has the other side of the<br>counter cultural coin being completely<br>erased<br>when prime minister jacinda ardern<br>brings a term like well-being into the<br>political discourse<br>or talks of kindness and the simple<br>concept of looking outwardly and beyond<br>ourselves<br>she sounds more like she's come from an<br>alternative lifestyles workshop than a<br>roundtable session with roger douglas<br>then there are the greens who emerged<br>from the remnants of the values party<br>who really were the first political<br>party<br>one of the first in the world in fact to<br>have counter-cultural ideas in their<br>manifesto um<br>grounded in counter cultural values<br>early green candidates included various<br>former communities environmental<br>activists and people who would once have<br>been described as hippies<br>there are many other ways in which<br>counter-cultural seeds have taken root<br>in new zealand life such institutions as<br>food co-ops<br>community law centers street fairs and<br>markets festivals and pride parades<br>all have counter cultural origins<br>today you'll find co-housing projects<br>and eco neighborhoods addressing ideas<br>of socially and environmentally<br>sustainable living ideas the<br>counterculture first articulated in the<br>60s and 70s<br>these days one in 10 new zealanders is a<br>vegetarian<br>offal or lamb chops are pretty well off<br>the breakfast menu now replaced by<br>muesli or yogurt which were unimaginably<br>exotic food stuffs in the early 60s<br>in the 2018 census almost half the<br>population said they had no religious<br>affiliation while alternative paths to<br>spiritual fulfillment such as meditation<br>and yoga have become so widespread as to<br>be considered mainstream<br>the old guard of moralising doctors who<br>decided who could and couldn't have<br>contraception of largely gone<br>pre-marital sex and couples living<br>together and having children out of<br>wedlock have ceased to be a subject of<br>moral panic<br>the married amendment act in 2013<br>allowed same-sex couples to marry<br>public discussions now turn to issues of<br>gender diversity<br>well the expression for love might have<br>gone out of vogue<br>terms like polyamory and open<br>relationship are part of the<br>post-millennial vernacular and could<br>perhaps be seen as free love with more<br>clearly to found defined boundaries and<br>conditions<br>at the same time the old<br>counter-cultural cry of freedom can be<br>heard echoing back in such quarters as<br>the anti-vaccination movement which has<br>seen a militant resurgence in this era<br>of covet 19.<br>as proponents share certain traits with<br>the protesters of the 60s and 70s<br>a belief that personal liberties<br>including freedom of speech are under<br>threat<br>the suspicion of state surveillance and<br>government conspiracies<br>some of their ideas can be linked to<br>theories about bodily purity and<br>alternative medicine introduced by the<br>counter culture<br>they employ familiar protest techniques<br>such as marches tickets and acts of<br>civil disobedience<br>though this movement is sprung up in<br>different parts of the country it has a<br>particular visibility in some of the<br>places that attracted the original<br>community such as nelson and coromandel<br>and there's at least one intentional<br>community in the nelson region that<br>espouses anti-vaccination as one of its<br>fundamental tenets<br>the message<br>seems a highly individualistic one<br>placing personal freedoms above the<br>safety of the wider community<br>as we saw with the fourth labor<br>government freedom can be interpreted in<br>many ways<br>but other recent movements<br>seem more altruistic<br>a renewal of youth activism can be found<br>in climate strikes rallies against<br>racism sexual violence and all forms of<br>inequality<br>if these protests don't have the<br>carnival spirit of some of the 60s and<br>70s gatherings that may just be a<br>measure of how much more urgent the<br>looking back<br>the counterculture can seem both<br>exuberant and ignorant<br>idealistic<br>and egocentric<br>there were acts of bravery in the name<br>of social justice<br>feats of imagination in the name of art<br>and fun<br>at the same time it's easy to see why<br>it's sometimes characterized as the<br>folly of a spoiled generation who had it<br>all and wanted more yet failed to ensure<br>that their children would be able to<br>enjoy the same freedoms<br>it's hardly surprising if today's<br>university students are less inclined to<br>sacrifice their grades for sit-ins and<br>happenings when you consider the giant<br>debts they'll graduate with<br>when home ownership is beyond the reach<br>of all but most privileged when rents<br>are extortionate and thousands of<br>sleeping in cars and streets james k<br>baxter's laments about suburbia as well<br>stories of job surpluses and landlords<br>that demand less than half your income<br>and rent now feel like fantasies<br>the nuclear sword that still hangs over<br>the planet has been joined by the even<br>more inexorable threat of climate change<br>sustainability<br>a utopian aspiration in the early days<br>of communes and holy earth catalogues is<br>recognized by today's youth as a<br>but millennials and their successes are<br>also discussing a vision of this<br>country's future that was barely<br>articulated in the conversations of

from<br>rather it requires them to recognize<br>that to live in this country is to exist<br>in terms of one's relationship with<br>maori undertakiriti or waitangi<br>not only does this acknowledge tiro<br>rangatiratanga<br>the traditions independence and<br>authority of the town of fenua<br>it also gives pakia a positive and<br>realistic way of seeing themselves<br>my parents who both grew up in this<br>country though my<br>mother arrived as a refugee at the age<br>of three<br>only really knew that they were pakia<br>new zealanders rather than europeans<br>when they went to london for the first<br>time<br>in 1959<br>and realized that their creative dreams<br>and visions of a better society didn't<br>belong there<br>if the anti-apartheid movement that<br>culminated in the 1981 springbok tour<br>protests helped speed the end of south<br>african apartheid it also made it harder<br>for pakia<br>in new zealand to ignore the systemic<br>racism in this country that they call<br>home<br>today it seems almost quaint to have<br>ever thought in terms of a<br>counterculture in new zealand<br>when to maori the whole of pakistan<br>society could be seen as just that<br>a counter to their culture a barbaric<br>intrusion upon the culture that was<br>already here<br>fully formed with its stories its<br>obligations and intellectual traditions<br>long before the<br>colonists came<br>viewed from this perspective what we<br>call the counter culture<br>can just look like another part of the<br>colonial baggage<br>then again<br>to help create a successful decolonized<br>future<br>i might draw on some of the things that<br>characterized the counter culture at its<br>best<br>imagination<br>empathy bravery<br>romance<br>respect for the land<br>great music<br>sense of humor<br>sense of justice<br>i might sum it up as a change of<br>consciousness<br>thank you<br>well<br>that was a<br>magnificent<br>wide-ranging thoughtful<br>subtle<br>challenging presentation i think<br>um<br>bits of it would have been familiar to<br>all of us who perhaps lived through or<br>know about or were small or not thought<br>of<br>during those years uh some of it will<br>have been new<br>weaving it together in that way<br>is original<br>and above all um i think what nick has<br>done<br>is avoided the trap of nostalgia<br>and challenged us to<br>think about what this history might mean<br>for aotearoa in the future<br>uh we've<br>i think we will leave it there rather<br>than invite questions it was a most<br>well put together<br>presentation<br>more than a presentation that sounds<br>so trivial it was magnificent uh we can<br>only look forward to the book and to the<br>debate discussion<br>and perhaps challenge that it will pose<br>so once again can i ask you to thank our<br>2021 john david stout fellow nick<br>bollinger for his lecture and to wish<br>him well for the final stages of his<br>point<br>if</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
