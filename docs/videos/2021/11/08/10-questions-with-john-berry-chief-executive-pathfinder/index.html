economics hi i'm bella<br>sigley i study a bachelor of commerce<br>majoring in accounting and finance and<br>we're here to interview john berry who<br>is the ceo at pathfinder kia ora john<br>gilroy sean and bella<br>good to be here what did you study at<br>university and how did that prepare you<br>for life in the real world<br>um what did i say university i did<br>i didn't know what i wanted to do so i<br>kept my options open which was<br>commerce and law degree<br>this was several years ago it was a<br>number of years ago but how did it<br>prepare me<br>i think it prepared me in terms of both<br>on the commerce side the financial<br>knowledge and the analytical skills and<br>on the law side<br>the ability to question and<br>find solutions to problems so i think<br>both them as accommodation were<br>fantastic<br>so what do you think will be the biggest<br>differentiating factor for graduate job<br>applicants over the coming years<br>i think over the coming years what's<br>becoming increasingly important is<br>eq skills so<br>not just intelligence and the ability to<br>understand numbers but also<br>skills around dealing with people<br>leadership skills<br>emotional intelligence<br>are really important and<br>i've been looked at quite deeply by<br>employers and i'd also say<br>another thing that's really important is<br>being memorable and being slightly under<br>being different and and standing out in<br>a really positive way<br>you just need to think about how you can<br>present yourself in a way that's going<br>to be positive in that value to a<br>business<br>how do you think pathfinders portfolios<br>are going to rebalance and change in the<br>future that's interesting actually<br>looking out into the future things will<br>continually change like social values<br>change um the way we invest changes the<br>we're getting better data we're getting<br>better disclosure<br>i think we will embed more around<br>climate change in our business um we're<br>looking at transition risk and integra<br>and carbon intensity of companies<br>already but we we're getting better data<br>every year um also on the um with animal<br>welfare concerns animal treatment animal<br>exploitation i think will become a big<br>investment theme in the future and and<br>we'll take that um take that further<br>and i suppose thirdly as well<br>people want to invest positively and<br>they also want to know their room um<br>their investments having an impact and i<br>think we'll see more<br>for us and and other managers just see<br>more measurement around the positive<br>impact that investments are having<br>so how do you overcome that issue of<br>diverging esg ratings across providers<br>yeah no it's a good question because it<br>is really tough there are different<br>providers that provide that are<br>different methodologies and often<br>provide different answers to<br>esg scoring environmental social and<br>governance scoring um how we deal with<br>that um you've got to work the best you<br>can with the data you've got i think one<br>advantage we have is we have kate on our<br>team who is an environmental scientist<br>so we don't just have people with<br>financial skills we have someone who's<br>got climate and environmental skills as<br>well to help us interrogate the esg data<br>but i suppose that that's the answer<br>you've just gotta<br>don't take numbers at face value you've<br>got to draw behind them and<br>um<br>you know do your own research as well as<br>taking external data what would be three<br>life lessons you'd like to share with us<br>three life lessons um<br>things you know and and being at the<br>university today at otago and just<br>generally hanging out with younger<br>people my kids um friends who are in<br>their eating twenties um you know young<br>people have incredible energy in new<br>zealand and i would just say to young<br>people be bold you know think big be<br>ambitious try lots of stuff<br>don't be afraid of trying new things and<br>seeing if you enjoy it see if you're<br>good at it you'll learn you'll learn<br>stuff from it and i suppose the<br>one of the most important lessons for me<br>was when we were setting up the business<br>and we're doing things differently in<br>terms of the social enterprise model<br>we're using<br>our b corp status um sometimes you think<br>you might be a bit mad because some<br>people are telling you this is not a<br>good idea no one's going to be<br>interested investing in this way or<br>you're doing things differently to<br>everyone else you know<br>why don't you just do what everyone else<br>is doing it's much safer<br>i would just say to people you're not<br>always mad when you're doing things<br>differently and<br>sometimes people just see the world<br>differently and in a better way to be<br>honest and if you're one of those people<br>fantastic run with it<br>so what attributes do you look for in<br>graduates coming through<br>we want smart people<br>but we want people that will fit in<br>culturally as well so cultural fit is<br>really really important to us<br>we think about<br>um<br>you know are they thinkers are they<br>aligned with our purposes of business<br>are they purpose-driven as individuals<br>so all those things which you can't<br>measure through tests you can measure<br>through um interacting with people and<br>trying to help try and understand them<br>and their motivations<br>what keeps you awake at night what keeps<br>me is i actually generally i sleep<br>pretty well which is good news but if um<br>if stuff is going to keep me awake<br>either<br>before we launched our kiwisaver um i<br>believed in the idea so much it<br>literally kept me awake at night and my<br>head was going a million miles an hour<br>and i wake up at two in the morning and<br>write things out and um and keep ideas<br>going and it was actually at the point i<br>had to build this thing because it was<br>literally um exploding inside me and so<br>that you know passion can keep you awake<br>all worries can keep you awake so when<br>kovan covert hit last year<br>international markets took a massive hit<br>so<br>share markets new zealand around the<br>world currencies were volatile<br>i lost sleep over that<br>because we have the responsibility of<br>managing money for people's retirement<br>and it's a huge responsibility you want<br>to get it right so<br>yeah they kept me awake<br>now who would be someone that you look<br>up to and why<br>people i look up to<br>um<br>i think there's some really cool people<br>in new zealand who are doing really cool<br>stuff and i'm going to mention two<br>people<br>francis valentine who runs<br>mine lab in auckland<br>and anya sentinean who's one of<br>the directors of pathfinder and she is<br>the ceo of leadership new zealand and<br>i admire both of them for<br>their thinking about the future<br>differently they're trying to educate<br>and<br>lead people to think about a different<br>atria and<br>think deeply about issues like climate<br>change and social equity and<br>i have a lot of respect for that how do<br>you balance your work and life<br>commitments um<br>yeah people people talk about<br>work and personal commitments people<br>talk about work life balance<br>and<br>because i love my job and i'm passionate<br>about the work we're doing<br>you know richard branson talked about<br>work-life integration which is actually<br>not trying to separate your work from<br>and and actually that's at times a<br>little bit unhealthy that you um you<br>actually need to have boundaries and you<br>need to have separation um so like i'm<br>i've got a family i've got two boys that<br>are 20 and 21 i want to spend time with<br>them and my wife um<br>so yeah you've just you've got to um and<br>and i'm not the best in the world in it<br>because i do my work i do work in the<br>weekends and i do work in evenings but<br>you've just got to put time aside for<br>what's important in your life<br>and to finish up what would be one piece<br>of advice you'd like to pass on to our<br>soon to be graduates<br>one piece of advice<br>one piece of advice i would pass on is<br>you've got to take some risks in life<br>you've just got to take sensible risks<br>you've got to be open to new ideas try<br>new things and it involves risk taking<br>you can't always take the safe path<br>good stuff will happen if you if you get<br>out there and try stuff and take a few<br>risks<br>well john i'd like to thank you very<br>much for your time today i think we've<br>had some really valuable insights and we<br>wish you all the best with pathfinder in<br>the future awesome thank you very much<br>it's been a pleasure chatting with you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
