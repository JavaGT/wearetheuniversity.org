natural world<br>is where people come together to discuss<br>knowledge<br>my grandfather would say if you can't<br> a papa to it then don't talk about<br>it so i would tell my story from this<br>perspective<br>there are three principles that underpin<br>the maori worldview<br>papa for now<br>the first principle of<br>a connection with genealogy from our<br>creation stories of the universe begins<br>in<br>the nothingness of an unlimited<br>potential<br>and way or water was everywhere<br>from this came the sun stars planets and<br>moons over ions and epochal periods of<br>light and darkness<br>god of the trees and forests<br>bringing the life principle from the<br>darkness into the light this preparation<br>created further life in white the<br>ocean's fresh water across the senua in<br>the sky<br>the second principle is for knowing<br>for relationships our interconnected<br>interconnectedness with the universe and<br>natural world<br>everything on this planet is<br>instructably linked<br>in many ways our connectedness to all<br>living things means we are part of a<br>much larger ecosystem not superior to<br>any other living organisms but rather<br>integrated with our<br>natural ecosystem human development has<br>caused the demise of many of the<br>children of rangi<br>climate change action is about<br>protection and restoration<br>for the benefit of our natural resources<br>and biodiversity species<br>rangi or sky farts protects all life in<br>papa<br>or his mother nourishes all life human<br>beings are one of the many children<br>the third principle is senua<br>which means land or placenta<br>this is the imagery of the placenta<br>nourishing baby whilst in the mother's<br>womb surrounded by water<br>relates in a metric sense that the world<br>is our wound and we are connected to it<br>by finnua and wine<br>this is holistic in it fatality and<br>fundamental to the maori worldview<br>it is custom to bury the placenta with<br>it free or near a tree where other<br>places have been buried which gives<br>meaning to the name tangata<br>or people of the land<br>we are the symptoms of rani and papa<br>there are there are token antenna within<br>each family or out of our younger<br>siblings this concept is the same in our<br>global family<br>human beings are tina the last born and<br>the other trees and all other life forms<br>we believe aina cannot achieve anything<br>without the support of<br>for those that have been pain and must<br>respect<br>if two cannot support senator then they<br>will provide customers<br>this in practice is the circle of love<br>and respect<br>we must reset the thinking and refocus<br>our efforts today that empower<br>actions<br>or guardianship and reconnect to this<br>wisdom<br>our ancestors believed with every part<br>of their being they were connected to<br>the natural world and lived in harmony<br>with the environment<br>we now have a climate crisis because<br>modern day<br>society has forgotten their connection<br>and responsibility to dhanyan papa<br>wars have created divisions between<br>countries causing intergenerational harm<br>capitalism has destroyed ecosystems<br>around the world and profiteering and<br>natural resources prevail over<br>environmental sustainability<br>fundamentally greed and hate influences<br>modern societies with no consideration<br>to their responsibilities obligations to<br>the natural world<br>we have lost our way<br>oral traditional knowledge has<br>transferred from generation to<br>generation<br>and this wisdom has ensured that we can<br>continue to survive and prosper<br>i share this knowledge in the hope that<br>the cop 26 leaders will make significant<br>tangible investment actions<br>that will change<br>the present path<br>this must be an interesting<br>for all our children grandchildren and<br>future generations<br>therefore we must empower and enable our<br>tohuma wise ones<br>knowledge holders navigators wayfinders<br>sears tree growers<br>forest whisperers<br>with hands gardeners hunters and<br>gatherers<br>and cooks<br>weavers seed flavours knitters potters<br>and beekeepers we must recognize and<br>include our creatives to bind us in<br>unity towards the spiritual<br>manifestation of collective intent<br>by singing<br>their songs of hope whispering prayers<br>bearing lights writing poems and hearing<br>their gifted and artistic minds<br>and we need the love of rainbow souls<br>star gazers imaginers dreamers inventors<br>sisters<br>daughters<br>nieces<br>healers growers<br>peacemakers medicine carriers and have<br>faith in their matriarchal leadership<br>we have work to do for all the children<br>of rangi and papa and for all our<br>children need to come<br>let us wage aroha<br>love and peace<br>foreign<br>i'm here today as a trustee of the human<br>ecology foundation a uk-based charity<br>that works across the commonwealth<br>countries to support<br>largely grassroots<br>projects that encourage<br>thriving communities and a thriving<br>environment<br>i have a day job in new zealand which is<br>to work for the department of<br>conservation where i'm involved in<br>treating negotiations although i'm not<br>here today representing the department<br>uh or in any way um but my my role is<br>largely across all facets of my life is<br>to really support uh<br>people making connections and<br>relationships with the environment so<br>i'm really happy to follow the corridor<br>that ganon has just given<br>and in my short time here today what i<br>would like to do<br>is to propose a<br>simple message<br>which is that by fostering and enabling<br>everybody to spend time in nature<br>we may have the tangible tangible<br>benefit or outcome of creating an<br>environment in new zealand where we can<br>where we have<br>low lying perhaps but large-scale<br>support for the structural change that<br>our government will need to make in<br>order to achieve<br>uh the type of commitments we're seeing<br>them make um<br>at the cop 26.<br>um so let's just start back with that uh<br>cop 26. so um there's been a lot of talk<br>a lot of commitments to date but the<br>what i'm seeing in the news is that the<br>rubber really hits the road this week<br>and to to achieve the commitments that<br>are being made in terms of percentages<br>reductions trees being planted wetlands<br>being restored<br>we will need we will need in my opinion<br>some structural change across the nation<br>not not just individual action but<br>government government setting up an<br>environment where those things can<br>happen<br>um and and to do that<br>successfully will need the support of<br>the people<br>so<br>one of the things that um not that i'm<br>speaking for them but the department of<br>conservation feel confident we can say<br>is that<br>time spent in nature is really good for<br>people and it in particularly we know<br>that it supports people's well-being<br>their resilience<br>to um<br>to changing environments other other<br>types of environments and also their<br>mental health particularly their mental<br>health<br>another thing um<br>so that's the message one about why this<br>is a good regardless of anything else<br>that's going on in the world but another<br>thing we know is that there is some sort<br>of positive or pro-environmental benefit<br>more so in children children especially<br>who spend time in nature um are more<br>likely to grow up to value and connect<br>with it as an adult but maybe some low<br>level underlying<br>positive attitude um change that comes<br>with people who spend time in the<br>outdoors and so my suggestion to you<br>today is that that we can't not<br>everybody is going to be a climate<br>activist<br>i mean we're going to see in the<br>following speaks speak speeches<br>a lot of really positive<br>projects and ways in which people can<br>engage directly with<br>projects that will produce real<br>really good outcomes for new zealand for<br>our environment um but there's there's<br>just also a background a background<br>level of uh<br>an attitude or or a um<br>kind of a moral imperative that it will<br>be really useful for us to create in our<br>society to achieve other changes to<br>support the climate change um<br>work that will need to be done um and so<br>my final point i've really got my five<br>minutes honed to a tea the final point<br>i'd like to make is something quite<br>exciting uh that we've found the<br>department of conservation has found in<br>some recent research and that is that<br>there's a group of people in our society<br>who recently agreed that they could make<br>a positive difference<br>through their own actions on the<br>environment and that was a group who are<br>younger so they're under 30 the maori or<br>pacifica and the middle class and so i<br>think that there's a bit of a widow to<br>go out there as well about the way in<br>which we change what it means to engage<br>with the environment to really harness<br>the you know what could be a really uh<br>wonderful group of people who could make<br>a real difference in this in in this<br>space um<br>and so just reflecting for me i'm just<br>going to finish with a reflection on<br>i've been watching some previous<br>sessions and i watched watch the youth<br>session um<br>on on friday um<br>as part of this conference and one of<br>the speakers there actually two of them<br>um<br>including our kepper who's going to<br>speak later spoke about the mata mataka<br>and<br>that seems to this personal opinion i<br>think that that's a really innovative<br>way we can re-look at how we engage with<br>the environment um to support those that<br>kind of thinking<br>about because that's what our challenge<br>is is to find new ways to bring those<br>people in and to encourage them to to<br>spend time outside in in the outdoors<br>um<br>so there with my high level um big<br>picture hat on i'm now going to pass<br>over<br>to bruce clarkson who<br>is going to speak about something much<br>more tangible and<br>really interesting with some work that<br>he's been doing in hamilton<br>bruce<br>uh i am bruce clarkson from kirikiri<br>roya hamilton and i feel extremely<br>privileged<br>today to be able to share some thoughts<br>with you<br>on how people in an urban centre<br>can mobilize<br>to bring indigenous nature back into a<br>city<br>and how that can provide a huge range of<br>environmental and societal benefits<br>it's easier of course if governments<br>like those that are meeting at cop 26<br>provide us with a sound policy and<br>statutory framework or even funding<br>but sometimes it's important not to wait<br>and implementation i believe is always<br>best when it's developed from the ground<br>up<br>it goes without saying that climate<br>change and biodiversity decline are<br>wicked problems and they are<br>inexplicably<br>connected and linked<br>and that without sustainable cities<br>we can't have global sustainability<br>but the real question is<br>what are we going to do about it<br>here are the key and great ingredients<br>in kirikouiroa hamilton<br>the key ingredients that are needed to<br>begin this sort of journey<br>kirikiri roa a river city in the heart<br>of the waikato<br>and a region famed for its agriculture<br>mainly darien<br>however<br>its indigenous biodiversity has been<br>severely depleted<br>less than two percent of it remains<br>within the city<br>because of its gentle terrain and most<br>of our indigenous habitat has been<br>efficiently<br>removed<br>but the building blocks<br>of a solution are evident on the saliva<br>on the slide here<br>the little bush remnants<br>the mighty wakato river<br>and its banks<br>the gully landform network shown there<br>on the slide in the yellow color<br>connecting into the waikato river<br>and the peat lakes<br>but most important of all<br>the people<br>and there you can see some people<br>working on<br>one of the projects i'm going to mention<br>shortly<br>since the year 2000<br>the city of kirikiri roa has been on a<br>mission<br>sometimes bumpy<br>and lacking in clarity<br>but now<br>building pace<br>and scale<br>to reinstate<br>and retrofit<br>its native plant and animals back into<br>the urban environment<br>by reconstructing indigenous habitat<br>in people's backyards<br>on public lands especially in the<br>gullies<br>and at the flagship project<br>waifakariki natural heritage park shown<br>there on the right with the lovely lake<br>the recent adoption of the long-term<br>plan commitment of 29 million dollars<br>to restore urban nature<br>by hamilton city council<br>is a major tipping point<br>informed by te awanui or kirikuri roa or<br>nature in the city strategy it<br>articulates a plan<br>for transformational change<br>habitat reconstruction is the major<br>pillar of the strategy<br>of this now more than 20-year journey<br>as work has progressed there has been a<br>growing realization of the many benefits<br>this brings beyond those<br>of the initial focus of the project<br>which was on reversing<br>biodiversity decline<br>many of those wider benefits are<br>summarized here on the slide for you but<br>of course this is not<br>a comprehensive list<br>and as you can see<br>on that list maintaining ecosystem<br>services<br>and carbon sequestration figure<br>extremely strongly<br>but it's the societal benefits i think<br>that are particularly striking<br>and important for our future mahi or<br>work<br>social cohesion<br>community building when people gather<br>together as they did on the previous<br>image to plant up another two or three<br>hectares of indigenous habitat on arbor<br>day at waifakuriki natural heritage park<br>and especially underscored i think at<br>the moment here in kirikouroa in alert<br>level 3<br>the health and recreational benefits<br>of nature<br>and high quality green space<br>in our own backyard<br>a key component impact of a planning<br>approach which nowadays is called the<br>20-minute city<br>finally<br>i just wanted to share some thoughts on<br>the learnings that we've made in our<br>project<br>here in kirikouri<br>and<br>think that possibly they might be<br>applicable in other parts of our tier<br>row new zealand and even even in other<br>countries<br>for the future change which will be<br>needed<br>to tackle the wicked problems of climate<br>change<br>and biodiversity decline<br>so drawing on the motto of te<br>pariwananga or wakato which is on loan<br>from an older wakatoki which way<br>people must be at the center of the<br>solution and indigenous knowledge too<br>then borrowing from my own discipline<br>which is ecology<br>the ecosystem concept applied not just<br>to our targets of interest the natural<br>ecosystems<br>but also to the other type of ecosystem<br>system that will help us<br>plan for success<br>and yes of course the funding ecosystem<br>which currently can be extremely diverse<br>sprinkled over top of that<br>a liberal dose<br>of the concept of super cooperation<br>which was so elegantly described in the<br>2012 book<br>which had the byline<br>altruism and evolution and why we need<br>each other to succeed<br>when we have all of these aspects<br>covered off<br>i think we may then have a reasonable<br>chance<br>at implementation<br>it's now my<br>privilege to hand over to peter my<br>colleague from northland he will sure<br>introduce himself<br>kirakoto i'll just get this<br>well thank you for the preceding<br>speakers sort of in some way setting the<br>scene<br>ganon was saying that that<br>we are the we are the junior we are<br>detainer and um<br>and and also touching on<br>who we are talking about<br>uh nature's capacity to heal<br>now following bruce bruce's beautiful<br>images<br>from kirikeri<br>he talked about the cooling impact of<br>trees and i i want to i want to focus on<br>that a little<br>now this image here is from<br>mikhail krejcic's book<br>about the new water paradigm<br>and what you can what you can see here<br>is the range of temperatures as revealed<br>by infrared photography<br>and if you look at the roof the roofs of<br>those buildings and if you look at the<br>the cars in the street you can see that<br>their temperature<br>is is over 30 degrees<br>that white light<br>but if you look into the into the<br>background and you see the see the trees<br>uh in that forest remnant you can see<br>that the temperature is down<br>around 14 degrees now that's a 15 degree<br>difference<br>we're asking to reduce the temperature<br>by 2 degrees<br>and this i find this really encouraging<br>because it tells me that we can do it<br>and we know what the ingredient is that<br>we need it's it's it's<br>trees<br>but i also should add at this point is<br>that uh pasture the well-growing<br>hydrated pasture<br>will will also<br>significantly cool<br>now so trees are a gift that keep giving<br>so<br>they will draw down carbon we know that<br>there's a lot of talk about<br>carbon drawdown<br>but they also<br>they also um<br>cool cool the environment so for example<br>by trans that they can a tree<br>a five meter tree will transpire about<br>100 liters of<br>liters a day and that's equivalent to<br>a couple of<br>air conditioning units domestic air<br>conditioning units and of course they<br>and then they also produce this<br>biodiversity which is the the engine of<br>nature we're not talking about<br>monocultures here we're talking about<br>diverse ecologies<br>so i'd like to suggest that even while<br>we absolutely have to stop burning<br>nature offers our best option for<br>mitigating and adapting to climate<br>change<br>i'll just repeat that point because it's<br>so important nature offers our best<br>options for mitigating and adapting to<br>so<br>really the the<br>the process that<br>is really critical here is that process<br>of photosynthesis<br>and what we've done over time is we've<br>degraded<br>much of the earth the earth's capacity<br>for photosynthesis i shouldn't say<br>capacity but it's actual is it because<br>it will it will um<br>it will<br>nature is abundant as as we allow it to<br>be<br>and of course in doing so<br>nature is drawing down carbon dioxide<br>through photosynthesis<br>transpiring transpiring water into the<br>air and thus cooling<br>but also<br>so<br>here's a<br>map of the<br>world<br>i found<br>this this place called rio negro in<br>brazil near very near the equator in the<br>middle of the rainforest<br>and the average temperature there is 9<br>if on the other hand we look at these<br>two other locations<br>one is close to the equator<br>but the average temperature is 19 to 37<br>degrees<br>and again up in the sahara desert or to<br>the north of the sahara desert<br>um 30 17 to 37 degrees now that that<br>last location is not<br>too much different than than<br>than us<br>in latitude<br>but so so much hotter<br>or relatively cool<br>so our fastest option<br>for cooling the planet is to actually<br>have to grow more trees<br>and you know if we if we focus on fossil<br>fuels alone that takes that that puts<br>climate change back to the start of the<br>industrial age<br>but actually<br>the the genesis of climate change was<br>back in those times when we started to<br>denude<br>we need to<br>make sure that papatunuku is well<br>clothed<br>um i just want to allude to this briefly<br>too<br>this is this follows a similar theme<br>what i find with our with our discourse<br>around climate change is often too<br>simplified<br>so we have for example trees are good<br>cows are bad<br>well actually cows<br>div<br>and i'm talking to people from waikato<br>here so cows in the right context do a<br>lot of good too i mean they build soils<br>but if you if you look at the way that<br>we um<br>we industrialize nature that's where on<br>the left-hand side here that's where our<br>problems begin<br>so what what we're doing we're looking<br>at emissions of methane but we're not<br>looking at the sinks that nature<br>so<br>in all of this and this is my my<br>research interests have been in<br>regenerative food systems<br>and climate change<br>and last year we completed a project<br>guided by local kamatoa looking at<br>looking at<br>regenerative agriculture<br>but the key learning for us<br>i think i guess we went into it with<br>this but it was much more it was<br>reinforced much more was it western<br>climate change isn't just a technical<br>problem to be fixed<br>when we when we can align western on a<br>line i'm sorry my the one of the kamata<br>would um clip me around there for saying<br>a line<br>when we create an interface between<br>western knowledge and mataranga maori<br>then maybe we can contribute better to<br>i'd like to hand over now to to hannah<br>haagen<br>awesomes<br>scotland melrose ear<br>chia everyone my name is hannah huggin<br>i'm from scotland in the east coast of<br>aotearoa<br>i'm 17 years old and i'm a climate<br>justice activist<br>i've just finished my first year here at<br>the university of waikato and i'm<br>studying political science and maori and<br>indigenous studies<br>i work for goeiko waikato's environment<br>center as a climate organizer as well<br>i'm passionate about creating a safe<br>climate future for everyone and i<br>believe that we can do this by<br>challenging the status quo<br>through transformative and creative<br>collective action<br>i'm really excited to be here today to<br>discuss the importance of nature<br>and to listen and total call the fucado<br>from the other panelists so<br>and i'd like to begin today by<br>discussing the study that was released<br>this year about climate anxiety within<br>young people<br>this study found that 60 of young people<br>feel very worried or extremely worried<br>about climate change<br>and this warrior is largely driven by<br>the inaction of governments so 65 of<br>participants felt that governments were<br>failing young people<br>lying about the impacts of action taken<br>and dismissing people's distress<br>as a young climate activist<br>i would agree with this respondents i<br>would<br>give the same answers if i was taking<br>this survey so governments predominantly<br>in the global north have spent decades<br>of an action on climate change because<br>they've chosen to prioritize the market<br>economy<br>and this is ongoing today<br>governments continue to implement an<br>economic model grounded in resource<br>intensive production systems that fail<br>to account for ecological and planetary<br>boundaries<br>this is resulting not only in climate<br>change but a plethora of environmental<br>issues such as deforestation<br>biodiversity loss and the degradation of<br>ecosystems<br>our political systems value the<br>prosperity of a minority through the<br>exploitation of resources and the and to<br>in an aotearoa context<br>these concepts of indifference to nature<br>and the maximization of profit through<br>exploitation are new<br>tangata fenua interact and live by the<br>world around them<br>as other panelists have already<br>discussed<br>the foundation of maori society begins<br>with people's understanding that they<br>are dependent and obligated to the<br>environment<br>the solutions to these environmental<br>crises at rest in the hands heart and<br>so provided that with climate change and<br>a general disconnect with the<br>environment no wonder young people are<br>feeling anxious for the world around<br>them because this is also operating<br>against a backdrop of rapid changes to<br>social technological<br>and environmental domains on an<br>unprecedented scale<br>rangatahi are also increasing<br>increasingly alienated from the<br>environment and are less likely to<br>engage in nature<br>so i believe moving into the future it<br>is our obligation to ensure that<br>everyone has equal access to the<br>environment and that we reconnect back<br>to that foundational understanding that<br>we belong to the environment the<br>environment doesn't belong to us<br>kia ora<br>um i now have the privilege to pass the<br>rako on to claire kiara<br>you got a koto um<br>called clear saint pierre<br>and yeah it's an absolute privilege to<br>be part of this<br>um<br>discussion today um<br>i'm here as someone who's been involved<br>in community conservation for over 20<br>years<br>and i hope to inspire some rangatahi out<br>there um just anyone that's listening<br>really that they can be part of really<br>positive action to turn things around<br>for related native biodiversity and also<br>i suppose to bring some hope um sort of<br>responding to what hannah's um just<br>covered really so i'm just going to<br>share a presentation<br>about<br>my group which is is for<br>mount pirangia and<br>i'm just gonna see if i can um<br>get that started<br>um<br>right so i hope you can see that so this<br>this is just a quick snapshot of who we<br>are and what we do so<br>um we're really run by volunteers we've<br>got 400 volunteers involved we've<br>reintroduced kokako and pitoy toy to<br>mount pirangia and we do heaps of stuff<br>in the environment and have lots of<br>people that<br>are involved with it so i've got the<br>contact details of our group here below<br>and um i just want to<br>um yeah encourage people if they're<br>thinking about oh i'd like to do<br>something positive why not choose um<br>the the most outstanding natural<br>landscape feature in the whole of the<br>waikato um<br>um that's the largest tract of unknown<br>broken native bush left and it's got a<br>magnificent altitude so that you know<br>it's a really great um i suppose has a<br>lot of resilience in terms of climate<br>change but it's also a biodiversity<br>stronghold with lots of rare species<br>still there um i just like to share some<br>of the stuff that i've heard just<br>members of the public tell me when<br>they've actually been able to see a<br>kokako up close uh these kokako were on<br>mount pyongya but they were dying out in<br>the 1980s and 90s and in fact the last<br>were were captured to stop them going<br>extant and we've been<br>had the amazing experience of being able<br>to bring those um kokako descendants<br>back to pyongyang and um<br>someone told me that just seeing those<br>spills with so much joy<br>they just can't describe it<br>and um we have<br>a setup where it's safe for people to<br>have their first experience at doing<br>some climate action with filling bait<br>stations or monitoring<br>and we've got lots of systems in place<br>and body systems and things like that so<br>people can choose the activity that<br>meets their fitness levels um<br>and and know that that they're going to<br>be yeah given the rundown on how to do<br>things so they can keep themselves safe<br>and actually make a difference make some<br>friends too probably and as someone's<br>already mentioned it's really great for<br>your well-being um it sort of<br>uh increases your resilience and and<br>it's it's good for your physical fitness<br>too<br>so um just to finish up really i wanted<br>to give a um a a a little image for<br>people and i'm sure in the springtime um<br>in pirikiiro and other places around<br>you've seen tui<br>come along to kualfai tree which are<br>in bud and are about to flower but the<br>things is you'll notice that they they<br>arrive at those qualified trees before<br>the petals open<br>and in some ways i think that the people<br>on this panel are those tui that are<br>gonna sing and sing their hearts out<br>um<br>to try and get those blossoms to open<br>and uh so that people can see those<br>beautiful yellow petals and and and have<br>the taste that nectar too<br>um so<br>dakota um that's me i didn't want to<br>take too long and now i'm going to hand<br>i'm just gonna<br>share my presentation here<br>uh good everyone um my name is bianca<br>so this is a<br>beautiful photo of whangaroo harbour<br>which is where i<br>whakapapatu<br>and i just wanted to start off with this<br>um<br>wakatoki<br>and<br>the translation of that is a ripple on<br>the sea a plunging bird but what it<br>means is or what it's telling us and<br>what it encapsulates is<br>a message from our tupuna<br>about observations and the importance of<br>our observations on our natural world<br>and so it was used by our people<br>to understand what kind of fish are<br>running in the moana according to uh<br>according to the ripples<br>on the water as the fish are diving um<br>i'm part of a group called modiote mona<br>which is a collective of<br>maori throughout<br>that are working towards<br>taking care of our<br>we are a united collective that works<br>together to activate and amplify efforts<br>for a healthy and thriving moana<br>so the three different kaupapa that we<br>are looking at are extraction uh<br>pollution<br>and governance<br>and so we know that we have one of the<br>largest<br>exclusive economic zones in terms of our<br>ocean space in aotearoa<br>uh very very little of it in fact uh<br>less than one percent is protected and<br>so that means that a lot of uh the<br>commercial industry has had free rain on<br>on our oceans<br>um in terms of extraction so extraction<br>obviously includes um<br>you know that includes recreational and<br>commercial fishing<br>um extraction is also uh you know<br>dredging<br>um extraction is um<br>you know extracting for earl and methane<br>and it's also mining for sand and<br>minerals<br>the next one is pollution so pollution<br>covers micro plastics which<br>uh if you head over to our facebook page<br>modi or timono you'll see that we did a<br>facebook live with some incredible<br>speakers we had<br>tina ngata<br>jerusalem and charlie thomas which we're<br>talking about microplastics and the<br>impacts that they have on our<br>biodiversity in our marine life<br>um<br>the other<br>koppa or the other issues the dual<br>pollution<br>discharge um into our marine environment<br>sedimentation um horticulture and also<br>dumping um so if there's<br>dredging happening a lot of the time<br>that has to be dumped somewhere also<br>within our space<br>and then governance is really around uh<br>decision making so that's you know<br>community they can come down to<br>community<br>hapu whanau<br>it covers the rma<br>um reforms<br>and tangata whenua tangata mwana so<br>um this morning i was um i was just out<br>paddling through some of our<br>um bays here on waiheke particularly<br>pootsiky bay<br>and i wasn't actually sure exactly what<br>i was going to present on so i'll get<br>into that a little bit later but i think<br>that one of the main issues that we<br>really need to be looking at in terms of<br>climate change is how did we get into<br>this mess in the first place<br>and so as maori we know that our tupuna<br>and through<br>the corridor and the wakatoki the<br>wakatawaki<br>that has been handed down to us through<br>our um<br>through our elders and the traditional<br>um knowledge that we still hold<br>that we have seen a huge decline<br>uh in our biodiversity within our ocean<br>space and within our tail as a whole<br>over the last um<br>200 years<br>and so this side that you'll see in<br>front of<br>in front of you now<br>has been put together by<br>hineka marco<br>and mike smith um who was also my dad<br>and i think that this really paints the<br>picture of where we have uh gone wrong<br>so on the left there you can see that we<br>have<br>the extractive economy and so that world<br>view is based on consumerism and a<br>colonial mindset which dominates<br>the way that our environment is<br>exploited um and extracted from<br>and so resources are looked at as a way<br>to create income<br>uh and so a lot of that is through<br>extraction which some of the speakers<br>have previously talked about and so<br>that's really about the big the the dig<br>burn and dump mentality<br>and um and so the way that that happens<br>and the purpose of it is the enclosure<br>of wealth and power and so you'll have a<br>few very few people that make a whole<br>bunch of money<br>of<br>other people that get paid a lot less<br>money<br>to use those resources that are of<br>detriment to our environment<br>and that is out held by the finance<br>um you know the finance sector of our of<br>of the current governance that we see<br>um dominating aotearoa uh if we look<br>over to the right hand side we look into<br>and so<br>and our environment we<br>directly whakapapatu<br>and so because we whakapapatsu the moana<br>and because we up others of the<br>whenua we have that relationship is<br>taboo<br>and that means that we have an inherent<br>responsibility<br>and we have tikanga and we have uh<br>corridor that informs us of our<br>relationship to that<br>and how we interact with that<br>and that is based on working together<br>in a deep democracy<br>where those resources are understood<br>as well as the limitations<br>and then and so therefore we<br>we conduct ourselves accordingly<br>and we<br>and as we've seen for thousands of years<br>and even here in altera<br>our people have been able to live in<br>balance<br>and with our environment<br>uh as to make sure that um that<br>exploitation and getting ourselves to<br>this point of serious trouble<br>doesn't occur<br>so how do we get from this destructive<br>com economy over to the water that you<br>see on the right<br>and that's really through us really<br>challenging what are our values<br>and how do we filter through that<br>in order to uh in order to reach<br>a way<br>of us existing<br>and being able to express our way of<br>living within te taya<br>uh so i guess i'm just going to bring it<br>back more to a local example so<br>this is<br>that are familiar with waiheke which i<br>um<br>which is where i am at the moment and<br>where i've spent um all of my life<br>um and my um my nana my grandmother and<br>my mom as well have been here on the<br>mutsu so have a deep connection to<br>waiheke and at the moment we are seeing<br>um<br>we are seeing<br>you know that the ecosystem of poutiky<br>bay<br>uh being further compromised the bay<br>that has already been put<br>at risk and within a moana that we know<br>is in decline in an ecological collapse<br>and so<br>as a community we have seen a challenge<br>against that<br>in terms of how do we look at our bay<br>how do we look at this environment how<br>do we look at this ecosystem and then<br>determine that it is healthy enough and<br>strong enough<br>to be able to withstand and to survive<br>the kind of destruction that we're going<br>to see in the bay through the<br>so<br>so<br>i'm not sure what happened there i think<br>i think it just um maybe i'm on waiheke<br>with a really bad connection so it might<br>have dropped out<br>um but i just wanted to really focus on<br>a community effort that's happening here<br>in waiheke amongst many of many other<br>kaupapa that are happening on the mutu<br>and it's been a really exciting<br>opportunity to see just how much people<br>care about our tallness species just how<br>much people care about our ecosystems<br>and our moana and understanding the life<br>that exists within the bay<br>so this is just some examples of the<br>life that is dependent<br>on<br>uh the life sustaining and the life<br>support system of pootaki bay so we have<br>we know that there's uh this there's<br>around 450 of them that are between the<br>bay of islands and tauranga so we are<br>very fortunate that they frequent our<br>bay at purzuki on the right the<br>matsukumona three to five hundred of<br>them left in the country and above that<br>a phenomenal shot that actually captures<br>uh three of our shags and one photo we<br>have the karuhiruhi the kawaii<br>and so we know that this life that this<br>uh this bay is full of life but what is<br>happening in an example of the way that<br>that extractive economy is held up<br>is that the only manu that really came<br>to the forefront in terms of the<br>resources resource consent that was<br>granted for the development at poutikey<br>bay was around the korura<br>which is our little blue penguin<br>but we know as locals<br>and we know<br>um through the corridor of our elders<br>within our community that there are<br>multitudes of life within this bay and<br>that are dependent on this bay and so<br>this has become a really exciting<br>opportunity to get our community<br>involved with and understanding the bay<br>particularly through ma tauranga maori<br>in the mataranga study that was done<br>by mario timona and alongside<br>fire america stewart who is a tuna<br>mataranga and i must also say an incr a<br>phenomenal um<br>who has also recently had the the newest<br>species of whale named after her ramadis<br>beaked whale<br>so we know that the biodiversity within<br>pootake bay within tikka tsika moana the<br>hauraki gulf<br>is already under threat<br>and so when we see further development<br>um<br>or what's themed as development<br>and further threats enter into our<br>ecosystems we become very concerned<br>because it's not about just us it's<br>about the importance of us<br>recognizing that all of our tanga<br>species are our tuakana all of our<br>taonga species we also up the two<br>and we have a responsibility to and they<br>are struggling because our ocean is in<br>serious trouble<br>so<br>the message here<br>is that<br>the governance structure that we have<br>seen has failed our environment it has<br>failed our wildlife and it has failed<br>our ecosystems which meant which means<br>that there has been um a degradation of<br>the maori of our mwana<br>and if we are to look at the concept of<br>modi<br>the mode um the modi uh modi is the<br>essential element that is sustains all<br>life forms it is the vital link<br>between all ecosystems and the diversity<br>another<br>really exciting and incredible uh event<br>that happened this year in january was<br>that the<br>uh the local eewee here on waiheke ngati<br>pawa placed the tikangarahui around<br>waikiki for the protection of thailand<br>species<br>we know that we go down to the moana and<br>we don't see tipa we don't see koda<br>kutai we don't see power anymore and so<br>there was arahui placed around the<br>island we know that<br>10 months down the track the government<br>has still<br>not<br>uh backed that up through legislation<br>by approving the temporary closure under<br>the fisheries act section 186a<br>however when you have the power and the<br>enthusiasm of community who know what's<br>happening within their backyard that<br>know what's happening within their wanna<br>uh there is a huge momentum and support<br>for the tsikanarahi that has been placed<br>around waiheke so even though that<br>hasn't been backed up by government and<br>through um through mpi as of yet and we<br>definitely encourage<br>uh the minister of oceans and fisheries<br>david parker to uh to do this<br>uh to approve the temporary closure we<br>know that within our own community<br>we are seeing a lot of support for the<br>rahui and<br>kind of i like the term that my dad uses<br>which is when<br>you have this kind of<br>community support<br>uh for the kaupapa that you know people<br>within your community almost activate<br>the little policemen inside themselves<br>which is to inform others and to hold<br>others to account if they are continuing<br>to extract these things out of our moana<br>that are already<br>you know either<br>functionally extinct or reaching that<br>point<br>so just in terms of modal tim1 as a<br>kaupapa<br>uh<br>you know there are a few different<br>things that we are focused on<br>intelligent gathering intelligence<br>gathering is really about informing<br>ourselves and doing research and making<br>sure that we<br>understand what's going on<br>um campaigns to support different hapu<br>and ewi with protection of their moana<br>which can be through rahui like what<br>we've seen with ngati hai<br>out on the coromandel<br>with the with the rahui<br>up in whangaroa with rahui up there on<br>tipa and also<br>the importance of ma tauranga maori<br>is not something that is to be<br>uh you know kind of pulled in and drawn<br>into the en and kind of added on to a<br>western science<br>uh way or or approach of doing things um<br>they need to be recognized as their own<br>separate things with their own manner<br>and the importance of that and i think<br>that when we look back into our history<br>you know<br>that we can see<br>uh out there on within our moana through<br>the corridor that's passed down to us<br>from our kuya and kaumatua we know<br>we know that things have drastically<br>changed over a very short amount of time<br>so<br>mataranga is key<br>um and recognizing those people within<br>the community within the habu within the<br>ewe that can inform that and then the<br>ability to wananga together just like<br>we're coming together today to talk<br>about this really important kaupapa<br>uh so i just wanted to<br>take the opportunity to say thank you<br>for allowing um the opportunity for us<br>to kind of share our pro proper here<br>today<br>um and<br>massive change is needed and it's needed<br>um it's it's needed right away and i<br>just want to end on<br>um the point that the rahui that we that<br>we've seen placed around waiheke and the<br>rahuia<br>is an excellent example of<br>rangatiratanga that has been asserted by<br>the habu and by the ewe<br>and<br>the government should be working at the<br>directive<br>of ewe of habu and ewe<br>and following up on the rahui that have<br>been placed<br>by<br>by approving those uh section 186a<br>applications as promptly as possible so<br>that's it from me today<br>and i'm now going to<br>hand over to keeper morgan who also has<br>a connection here to wahike<br>and has also been a huge uh<br>inspiration to me with the incredible<br>mahi that he has done and i'm looking<br>forward to hearing from you kippah uh<br>kyoto<br>m<br>and the creator of the modi model<br>decision making framework<br>modi as bianca has said is um it's the<br>life supporting capacity<br>it binds the physical to everything else<br>that supports life<br>and it enables everything in the<br>universe<br>indigenous knowledge<br>has a unique contribution to make<br>regarding climate change response<br>indigenous knowledge<br>does not focus on the individual<br>but rather is focused on all of our<br>collective roles within our ecosystems<br>our ecosystems of origin are identified<br>by the mountains<br>the rivers the lakes and the forests<br>that have carried the names of our<br>ancestors for millennia<br>indigenous knowledge is place specific<br>and has already aligned values<br>based practices<br>and beliefs that ensure the continued<br>flourishing of the ecosystem to produce<br>but the world we now live in<br>is being destroyed by consumerism and<br>corporate greed<br>and a number of the previous speakers<br>have referred to this<br>consumerism has created artificial<br>realities that can only be sustained by<br>processes that cause resource depletion<br>excessive waste and pollution<br>one of the symptoms of this<br>is climate change<br>another is the disappearance of nature<br>but the disappearance of nature<br>does not matter to peoples<br>who exist in artificial realities<br>even the global pandemic<br>in an indigenous reality<br>nature<br>does not exist separately from the<br>peoples of their place<br>and several of the previous speakers<br>have said this also<br>it does not exist because the indigenous<br>people and nature are an unseparable<br>inseparable reality<br>nature matters when the name of the<br>river<br>and your own are the same<br>as in the case of the waikato the<br>waikato people and the waikato river<br>the separation of nature from humanity<br>is an artificial concept of descartes in<br>science<br>the separation of people from nature<br>facilitates practices such as the rape<br>of the global commons<br>and ownership of resources at a scale<br>that diminishes the responsibility for<br>and respect towards those resources that<br>is essential for their continued<br>flourishing and abundance<br>compelling indigenous ways of relating<br>to nature<br>are needed<br>holistic understandings of nature<br>through an indigenous lens are needed<br>the moto model decision making framework<br>was created for this purpose<br>and<br>i'm going to share one of the tools<br>in that to uh<br>okay<br>so you're looking at<br>fighty<br>the lake outside my door<br>the lake that carries the name of two of<br>my ancestors<br>and his<br>okay i'm wondering what's happening<br>bianca mentioned modi<br>and what<br>is different about modi is the way our<br>tupuna understood it and measured it<br>bianca mentioned that modi was our way<br>of understanding<br>sustainability<br>and continue flourishing<br>the difference between indigenous<br>knowledge and science is this<br>a tupuna without a written<br>written record did not focus<br>on normality<br>they did not focus on recording data<br>that represented what was normal<br>and so on this modiometer you can see<br>that no change ranges between a negative<br>zero and a positive zero<br>this is normal variation<br>and our tupuna had the good sense not to<br>really be paying too much attention to<br>that because they knew that that was<br>normal<br>what they did was they focused on the<br>outliers<br>the things that science tends to<br>disregard<br>the outliers<br>when it's outside normality are either<br>going to be better than normal or worse<br>than normal<br>and those are correspondingly positive<br>and negative impacts on the modi of that<br>thing or that collection of things<br>now in terms of that also our tupuna<br>realized you only really needed to know<br>if it hit its absolute carrying capacity<br>or its absolute flourishing<br>or<br>its absolute exhaustion depletion<br>extinction<br>and what it does is when you look at the<br>ecosystem and everything around you in<br>this way<br>and your responsibility<br>is kaityakitanga<br>or enhancing the modi<br>for the future<br>you're going to act to ensure that the<br>maori is<br>always going to be on the positive side<br>of the modiometer<br>conversely all of the practices we've<br>been talking about that represent our<br>world today<br>consumerism<br>pollution<br>exhaustion of resources and everything<br>else<br>sits on the negative side of this<br>modiometer<br>and in fact we talk about approaching<br>tipping points<br>the minus two is the tipping point<br>our tupuna would look at us and think we<br>were crazy<br>why are we even on this side of the<br>modiometer<br>if you want to look at it in technical<br>terms tipping points to the<br>to your left<br>sustainability to your right and<br>the easy way of understanding what<br>change is happening is if if change is<br>normal then that's normal variation and<br>score zero<br>but if it's not it has to be positive or<br>negative<br>and unless it meets the absolute<br>threshold or plus two or minus two it's<br>a partial change being plus one or minus<br>one<br>so this is what you can do<br>with that simple understanding you can<br>actually represent holistic<br>understandings of indigenous people as<br>this one for the waikato river is<br>representing<br>you have four dimensions of maori<br>representing what's understood as the<br>four well-beings in the resource<br>management act<br>those can be combined simply<br>uh because you have a simple scale you<br>can combine and aggregate scores for<br>different indicators without losing the<br>meaning<br>of that collection of indicators and you<br>can combine all of the dimensions<br>likewise<br>you can show them back on the modiometer<br>which are immediately recognizable as<br>what's happening the modiometer in the<br>center is showing<br>a normal moti<br>the modiometer is intuitive<br>but is also extremely practical<br>as it can be used to measure both<br>quantitative and qualitative measures<br>and the aggregation of scores is<br>as intuitive<br>example i've shown was for the waikato<br>river<br>and i'm going to come home to home my<br>taffeti<br>homai tafiti our ancestor in tafiti<br>in hawaii<br>he provided the instruction to the<br>tarawa people in his<br>bind all in the world of light<br>to everything else<br>it is modi that binds the physical to<br>foreign<br>the university of waikato is proud to<br>introduce the world's first partner of<br>climate change for the people who know<br>there is no planet b<br>gain the skills needed for the jobs of<br>tomorrow<br>contribute to a fundamental shift in the<br>way we do business and go about our<br>lives<br>explore how mata maori can bring<br>perspective to the most pressing issue<br>of our time<br>apply now and carve a career where<br>passion and purpose collide<br>i really enjoyed<br>um<br>yeah listening for listening to you all<br>i killed uh um yeah now it was just<br>awesome to have the opportunity to<br>share<br>on the webinar um<br>yeah as<br>it all some more about<br>a few things that you shared and<br>yeah just<br>um the modi the modi meter<br>is<br>is incredible and um<br>and we did a um<br>when we did a mataranga study on putiki<br>it was really about the modi of the bay<br>and so<br>looking at the entirety of the bay and<br>what the bay had already had to<br>withstand<br>um<br>and how we determined you know<br>the kororai has been put to the<br>forefront of this specific kaupapa and<br>in terms of what we're focusing on with<br>maori otsumana this is really small<br>scale<br>but it's also really powerful because<br>it's about community<br>but it's about<br>for us it was about<br>understanding the importance of all of<br>our tonga species we don't we don't<br>differentiate<br>that one is at risk declining one is<br>um you know is is endangered nationally<br>endangered um there are<br>and they're equally as important to our<br>ecosystems<br>and um and to the modi of the bay and so<br>yeah just uh awesome quarter all shared<br>today everybody<br>and hopefully we can create some<br>connections um from this opportunity<br>moving forward kyoto koto<br>you<br>curab<br>we've got something happening up in<br>tutukaka harbour too<br>and i think you know<br>we know that the<br>we know that the the kelp for example is<br>can sequester more carbon than<br>sequester as much carbon as a rainforest<br>and we don't see the devastation that<br>goes beneath the waves usually<br>so um<br>the other thing we're facing up there is<br>a whole lot of sedimentation and of<br>course we have the kinder barons that<br>are all along our shores<br>so we don't want to<br>yeah but<br>in dealing with it and i think glenn<br>eddy you may have come across glenn<br>edney down in<br>waiheke he's i'm working with glenn yeah<br>and thank you everybody for uh it's good<br>to listen to the diverse contributions<br>very quickly hannah um i did a little<br>bit of work too on um<br>on<br>that sense of agency uh that young<br>people need and i think hope is really<br>important too<br>and they need they need both a sense of<br>agency they can do something about it<br>as claire was talking about but also<br>uh pathways of action<br>and i think the pathways of action are<br>to be found in the natural<br>world that's right and also making sure<br>that everyone has<br>equal access<br>um to nature<br>and to show that young people are<br>empowered to actually engage with the<br>world around them<br>um yeah and everyone has access to<br>what should naturally be integrated into<br>our everyday life suppose we know um is<br>that brings us to the end of this<br>session and i'm going to draw on a<br>couple of whakatauki just to close out<br>the first is the one that gannon used to<br>and that reflects that my my strength is<br>not that of myself alone but that of<br>those that i stand with<br>and gannon is right in that i think each<br>of the presenters<br>have given a really good contribution to<br>this kaupapa today<br>in this meaning the second um part<br>after thanking our presenters<br>is to recognize the source of a lot of<br>and i think i can remember this but<br>there's a um<br>and what that says is when i stand in<br>the presence of a tree<br>do i stand in the presence of my older<br>brother<br>when i feel the wind do i know that is<br>wind that sustains me<br>when i sense the fresh waters do i know<br>that i am of water<br>bangi and papa are my parents<br>and i dwell between them<br>it is the bruce of life so curato thank<br>you for watching<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
