managing director of<br>simplicity how are you today good thank<br>you thanks thanks for having me along no<br>worries and the first question is what<br>did you study in university and how did<br>your degree prepare you for the real<br>world<br>well um i had had nothing to do with<br>numbers so i studied philosophy at<br>university and politics and um how did<br>it prepare me hmm i think the parties<br>probably prepared me quite a lot for the<br>real world as well but um one of the<br>interesting things about the liberal<br>arts i guess is it taught me critical<br>thinking<br>so not you know to understand an idea<br>but not to accept it without challenging<br>it so i guess that was what i i don't<br>remember anything i learned<br>uh but i came out of it with an ability<br>to<br>think i hope<br>yeah awesome so you're the founder and<br>managing director of simplicity a<br>non-profit fund manager<br>what makes simplicity different from<br>other kiwisaver fund managers well have<br>you got a couple of hours<br>let me cut it down unfortunately a few<br>really simple points we're a non-profit<br>which means we charge much lower fees<br>we're owned by charity which means we<br>give 15 of those fees to charity it's<br>about a hundred thousand dollars a month<br>now<br>um and we invest passively so we<br>don't make active decisions about what<br>we invest in although we do invest<br>ethically and with a purpose as well so<br>yeah that's i guess that's what makes us<br>different yeah<br>you've worked for goldman sachs nate<br>west markets faye<br>rich white and ibm new zealand which<br>role was the most challenging and why<br>look i think goldman sachs was the most<br>challenging because<br>it is a very<br>it's a high-powered organization right<br>it's a serious investment bank<br>and<br>they uh you know they really didn't<br>understand the work life balance<br>it was the work work balance<br>so um i spent an awful lot of my time in<br>planes<br>all over the world and working very hard<br>so it's challenging in that sense but it<br>was also the most amazing experience<br>because it was just working with<br>incredibly high quality people high<br>caliber people and that's that's just a<br>joy you know<br>and i got to meet a lot of amazingly<br>interesting companies as well<br>and i was working at an in a period of<br>time when china was just opening up so<br>we were doing a lot of business in china<br>as well which was really fascinating<br>early on<br>yeah<br>so what are your three most important<br>life lessons<br>um<br>i have a lot of life lessons but i guess<br>if i was to narrow it down to three i<br>would say because if i was to say to<br>someone like you you know what advice<br>could i give you in life i guess the<br>first one would be it doesn't matter<br>what you're good at just be good at<br>something<br>so um<br>because the because it's you know it<br>the world is very competitive<br>so<br>the trick is finding what you love<br>and then doing it really well and don't<br>worry what anyone tells you about<br>whether that's good or right or<br>appropriate or not just be good at<br>something i think that would be the<br>first thing i think the other thing is<br>that you know success is one percent<br>inspiration and 99 perspiration nothing<br>substitutes for hard work so all of<br>these people who are gifted rich parents<br>advantages in life they will not make it<br>unless they work hard so i think that<br>would be the second thing<br>but the third and perhaps the most<br>important<br>life lesson is always have some purpose<br>in your life<br>and that purpose usually involves giving<br>back or giving something to somebody but<br>a life with purpose is a much happier<br>life<br>all other things<br>aside than one without but you have to<br>find your own purpose as well so have a<br>purposeful life<br>do something really well and just work<br>hard<br>and it'll all work out<br>what attributes do you look for in<br>graduate recruits<br>um i think the thing we most look for is<br>um let's call it<br>attitude and curiousness<br>so<br>we hire a huge nut from all over the<br>world we have employees from<br>sudan<br>the republic of the congo i mean just<br>everywhere in the world<br>they all have<br>i think<br>two things in common one is they're<br>curious right so they just want to know<br>things and they want to find things out<br>so they will naturally<br>know how to ask the right question right<br>accept an answer as being correct unless<br>they really feel it's correct you know<br>they'll challenge<br>i think that's the first thing<br>um i think sorry i said the second<br>actually<br>i'm going to use a terrible word here it<br>says we don't hire wankers so i'd<br>actually think you know you've got to be<br>a nice person and a collegiate person<br>because the power of a team is so much<br>more than the power of the individual so<br>you've got to better get on and be in a<br>team and you've got to be curious from<br>that pretty much everything else follows<br>we have an interesting hiring purpose we<br>get everybody to hire everybody so<br>everyone has to be interviewed twice by<br>every other employee so it's incredibly<br>difficult to join us<br>because it's very time consuming but by<br>then when they start on day one they<br>walk on and they feel like they're part<br>of the family because everyone's tic<br>everyone's agreed that they should be<br>hired and they feel like they know<br>everybody and then everybody knows that<br>makes it so it's a very very long<br>process to get in but it's highly<br>successful hardly anybody ever leaves<br>yeah awesome how do you measure<br>achievement and why<br>is that personal achievement or the<br>achievement of others why don't we do<br>both okay well my personal achievement<br>is<br>you know the single most important thing<br>i am as a father<br>so<br>everything else pales into<br>insignificance in terms of<br>how i do as a dad<br>um<br>i think uh<br>and then in terms of achievement it's<br>that purpose thing so get up in the<br>morning i think look<br>was this a day usefully spent in the<br>service of others<br>pretty much is how i operate and from<br>that i get really<br>in terms of<br>achievement in others is you know how i<br>said before just be good at something i<br>just really admire people who work hard<br>to be good at something i don't care<br>what it is<br>and i've found myself<br>falling in love with people who do the<br>stuff that i would never have considered<br>to have been<br>you know worthy before i you know i i i<br>started appreciating just doing<br>something well is really cool<br>um my my stepson does graffiti art i<br>would have considered him a urban<br>terrorist<br>a graffiti art and now i just love<br>graffiti art right because he's really<br>good at it<br>and and and so yeah so that's that so<br>so that that's what i sort of i<br>value in others um but but in myself it<br>is only the<br>how i've made other people's lives<br>better<br>what keeps you awake at night<br>uh nothing<br>i sleep usually sleep really well um you<br>know look if i have an argument you know<br>or something like that you might do but<br>um<br>no i i um<br>i sleep really really well because i'm<br>not you know at the end of the day<br>all i am is one part of an amazing team<br>and we all do our part we all do our<br>role<br>and i know that the team<br>is going to win is running the business<br>really well so that i can come and do<br>these things which has got nothing to do<br>with actual running of the business<br>right<br>so yeah i do i um really nothing keeps<br>me awake at night maybe too much red<br>wine actually<br>yeah<br>awesome so who do you admire and why<br>um look there are lots and lots of<br>people i admire right so you're asking<br>me who's my hero yeah um my if i was to<br>think of one hero it probably in history<br>would probably be<br>eleanor roosevelt<br>um the wife of of<br>of um fdr<br>and the reason was that<br>i mean being the wife of a president<br>like her must have been incredibly<br>challenging in its own way but then when<br>he died<br>she basically was seen almost<br>single-handedly responsible for the<br>development of the modern u.n modern<br>united nations<br>and she was incredible in the way that<br>she could jolt all of these<br>cold war powers to agree to actually get<br>something like the u.n functioning well<br>not a lot of people know that<br>but<br>and the job she did was<br>incredible and also remember she was a<br>woman at that time<br>so you know she used what mana she had<br>as the ex-wife of a present so she's<br>probably my hero in terms of doing<br>something which is utterly incredible uh<br>in in a very modest way<br>um yeah that's probably<br>probably number one yeah awesome how do<br>you find balance between work and<br>personal commitments<br>um<br>i don't<br>my life is a soup<br>so you know i have technology and and<br>i'm always<br>if i'm walking i came here last weekend<br>i'm walking along st killed us and i'm<br>talking to someone on the phone<br>but i'm enjoying myself you know so i i<br>can't make that distinction it all sort<br>of falls into one um i think that in<br>fact my personal challenge is switching<br>off<br>when i'm having conversations with<br>people because i'm you've got two or<br>three conversations going on my head at<br>the same time i'll switch off and focus<br>on<br>so i'm not sure i don't actually think<br>there is this work<br>life balance thing i'm not sure for a<br>lot of professionals is the right<br>question to ask<br>it's that<br>are you happy and have you do you have a<br>purposeful life<br>and that might be<br>work and it might be pleasure it might<br>be both and our last question what is<br>one piece of advice that you would like<br>to share with soon-to-be otago at<br>graduates<br>this is going to sound so woolly i would<br>say follow your heart<br>by the time you become a graduate<br>you have acquired a pretty sophisticated<br>set of skills<br>of judgments because you're going to be<br>able to keep yourself out of trouble but<br>then you're going to be presented with a<br>range of options<br>and you're going to have to choose<br>and<br>when i say follow your heart if you do<br>something that you know and feel feels<br>right<br>inside you are likely to do much better<br>at it you know i can be much better<br>better at it succeed at it<br>and feel nourished in the process yeah i<br>know that sounds very woolly right you<br>want to hear a practical piece of advice<br>but<br>whenever you hit a junction in life<br>and<br>you generally know what the right thing<br>is to do<br>it's a tough decision<br>but um<br>follow your heart what does my heart<br>tell me to do now i know there are a lot<br>of parents who say don't do that<br>you know that's a crazy you'll golf down<br>some crazy wild goose chase you have a<br>look at all of the most<br>creative and successful people in their<br>lives they don't do it because it pays<br>the most they don't do it because<br>they say it with talent they do it<br>because they love it<br>you know they love it and and if you<br>love it you'll do you'll do well at it<br>yeah<br>cool so thank you so much for coming<br>along today sam we really appreciate<br>your time and um have definitely learnt<br>a lot and<br>things to take away from this so all
