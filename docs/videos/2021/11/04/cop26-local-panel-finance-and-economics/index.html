to<br>engage on one of the big issues<br>associated with cop 26<br>analysis and issues intersect with<br>all the policy and<br>debates that are going on<br>the interaction<br>between<br>science<br>and its implications will the<br>implications get worked out in the world<br>of<br>economic and social interactions<br>so we have a distinguished<br>panel with us here today<br>and we look forward to<br>contributions<br>my name is frank scrimgeour<br>i'm<br>professor of economics at the university<br>of waikato and i'm delighted to<br>welcome<br>linda diaho<br>lee keenan<br>liz oxley<br>congo kirkwood and um<br>and we look forward to the<br>contributions and<br>we're honored to hear from each and<br>every one of them<br>today<br>um<br>one of the things that i would start<br>lines which has come out of cop 26<br>already you know<br>get in line or get out of the way<br>um<br>and<br>the question is how do we get into line<br>who needs to get into line how do you do<br>it um<br>i think many of us have seen uh<br>cueing for various events and seen all<br>kinds of chaos where<br>um<br>where the process hasn't been right so<br>so we have to<br>grasp uh<br>the specifics we have to grasp<br>the nettle<br>it's a challenge for us in iitra and new<br>zealand<br>it's a challenge at the level of the<br>household the firm<br>the ely<br>region the nation<br>it's a global challenge and so<br>i look forward to<br>the contributions today so firstly<br>linda<br>thank you very much for<br>being willing to talk today<br>we look forward to your presentation<br>my name is linda thiago and i'm the<br>chair of te aratoda the executive board<br>for waikato tanui a large tribal<br>organization in the center of the north<br>island<br>and in our tribal area our waikato<br>tanari is a significant landowner<br>commercially we are a major investor and<br>developer<br>we have an overall long-term strategy<br>that would see all of our tribal members<br>successful in all areas of their lives<br>from health education to social and<br>financial well-being<br>as part of that strategy our<br>organization is responsible for<br>intergenerational wealth creation<br>in our group of entities across our<br>large organization our commercial<br>company tynery group holdings manages a<br>diverse range of developments from farms<br>to forestry to fisheries and property<br>including a large inland port and<br>infrastructure hub in one of our<br>country's largest cities<br>we know that each of our developments<br>will impact and be impacted by climate<br>change in different ways<br>we are working to understand our current<br>impact and how we can work better<br>towards better carbon outcomes that meet<br>the expectations of the people we<br>represent<br>and how we can play our part in leading<br>the country through positive climate<br>action<br>our expectations are also guided by our<br>ancestors who were alive prior to the<br>mass confiscation of our lands and<br>waterways<br>ancestors who had control over<br>environmental outcomes<br>and those expectations are guided by our<br>future generations who will in time ask<br>questions about our decisions and our<br>actions of today<br>we have as an organization imprinted our<br>expectations and targets into our<br>50-year strategic plan called<br>whakatupuranga 2050.<br>our organisation's environmental plan<br>and our vision and strategy for the<br>holistic restoration and protection<br>of the health and well-being of our<br>ancestral river the waikato river which<br>is central to our identity<br>our commercial company is in the process<br>of shaping environmental social and<br>governance criteria for operations that<br>align with our laws and our values it is<br>called manawa<br>unlike small pools of water that can be<br>dried up by the sun<br>the waters of runa are cells from the<br>earth and will never run dry<br>our sustainability framework is based on<br>the concept of never running dry<br>being able to keep providing forever and<br>ever<br>i have the privilege of chairing our<br>executive board to aratoda and we have<br>created an investment framework for our<br>commercial entity which also fulfills<br>the role of chief investment officer for<br>our wider group<br>this framework is called<br>and it outlines our expectations in<br>respect of how and where we invest<br>it won't come as a surprise that those<br>expectations align with our worldview on<br>and responsible responsibility for<br>living well with the earth<br>i leave you with an ancestral saying of<br>the second maori king king tafiao<br>who reminded us of the importance of<br>ensuring that living treasures such as<br>our lands and waterways are able to be<br>our river of life its bends its curves a<br>living treasure for the faces of the<br>future<br>thank you linda that was really uh<br>valuable and<br>it's exciting to hear tai nui's<br>aspirations for for action<br>and so<br>now i'd like to<br>move on to professor<br>liz oxley and he will<br>bring to us uh his thoughts particularly<br>in relation to the circular<br>economy and their relevance to the<br>issues that we're facing today thank you<br>professor oxley<br>you're frank you're uh<br>everyone<br>um i'm les oxley i'm professor of<br>economics at the university of waikato<br>and i'm also a member of a large ongoing<br>team at the university um looking at<br>the role of the circular economy<br>in<br>in terms of increasing well-being in new<br>zealand that project is<br>at error<br>and i'm going to say a little bit about<br>the work that we're doing but mainly<br>concentrate on<br>what the circular economy is and what<br>the circular economy could potentially<br>do<br>for sustainability and in particular<br>climate change<br>so the circular economy is is an<br>approach it's a system<br>that seeks to keep existing resources<br>um<br>in the system<br>as long as possible<br>rather than them going to waste so<br>by resources here we mean things that we<br>need to make goods<br>that we consume<br>things like steel aluminium<br>computer<br>chips and importantly energy<br>so<br>this requires that what the circular<br>economy requires what was<br>or is currently waste<br>becomes the stuff that is used to make<br>new products<br>either new products<br>that are<br>different to or the same as the products<br>that created the waste in the first<br>place<br>and it can either do that by redesigning<br>how we make things so that the waste is<br>reduced<br>or minimized<br>or it can redesign<br>products so that the waste is explicitly<br>part of the process<br>in as much as the waste is made useful<br>for other products that we might make<br>so energy is a very important resource<br>when we make<br>almost anything any goods that we<br>subsequently consume<br>so<br>if we were for example to be making<br>something that requires steel or<br>aluminium<br>we can either take an ore<br>iron ore or bauxite and we can create<br>that material<br>and the extent to which all of that<br>material is not used it will create<br>waste<br>and if we don't use that waste if we<br>throw it away<br>then when we want to make<br>more aluminium or more steel we have to<br>use more energy again to create that<br>input that thing that we need<br>now that waste that we created has<br>inside it the energy that is being used<br>to create it in the first place<br>so the extent to which we can reuse what<br>was waste<br>means that we are inevitably going to be<br>using less energy because we're not<br>having to go back to the beginning of<br>the chain<br>and start to use all to produce goods<br>so we can think of that process in many<br>many different products but energy<br>and its consequent um potential carbon<br>emissions that come with it<br>um are part of the process and<br>circularity attempts to<br>fundamentally reduce the amount that<br>goes to waste by design<br>of new products by design of all<br>products<br>but one of the consequences will be the<br>energy use and<br>scarce resource use will be reduced over<br>time<br>now what can't go<br>to be reused what can't go<br>into producing other goods and services<br>as part of the circular economy<br>we<br>we require that those<br>genuine waste products<br>can be<br>composted in some form so we can think<br>about<br>packaging<br>if that packaging is produced in a<br>circular way it will be compostable and<br>the circularity happens when that<br>compost is then goes back to the land<br>so to get the full benefits of going<br>circular we really require that there's<br>a national level transformation of how<br>we produce goods in atari or new zealand<br>we can get some benefits from some small<br>scale schemes but the full benefit for<br>new zealand and for the planet<br>ultimately comes when all areas of the<br>country are part of a circular network<br>so that we can we can all contribute<br>to making that waste available for<br>others to use<br>and we can all contribute in terms of<br>being able to get access to that waste<br>so how does this help<br>well we'll be using fewer new materials<br>using fewer new resources to make things<br>and we'll be using less energy to make<br>things<br>so we don't necessarily have to be<br>consuming less the circularity to give<br>us benefits although consuming less will<br>give us additional benefits we don't<br>how do we get<br>this circular economy<br>more sustainable<br>lower energy use<br>system to work<br>well i think it's important to realize<br>that we could have circularity right now<br>there's nothing fundamentally stopping<br>us<br>having a more circular economy<br>but there are things that are happening<br>in new zealand and things that are<br>happening worldwide but let me<br>concentrate on new zealand which are<br>stopping circularity giving us these<br>benefits<br>right now<br>one is that creating waste<br>creating carbon is far too cheap<br>so there's no incentive for businesses<br>to<br>economize on their use of energy there's<br>no incentives for them to economize<br>on the use of new materials because it's<br>too cheap so it weighs cheaper landfill<br>is cheaper<br>energy and carbon<br>secondly<br>there are certain markets that are<br>missing in the system<br>there are markets for recycling which<br>don't exist<br>the transactions costs for businesses<br>are too high<br>so again it's cheaper for example let's<br>take new buildings it's cheaper to chuck<br>stuff into landfill than it is to create<br>a market for unused timber<br>many of these wastes that come from<br>building are not<br>from demolition but they're from<br>products that aren't used in the process<br>because it's easier to throw them away<br>and markets don't exist<br>to um to allow that recycling to occur<br>and part of this is the institutions<br>don't exist<br>to facilitate the development of missing<br>markets<br>so getting to circularity has a role for<br>many different actors<br>so current and new markets have a role<br>to play in terms of circularity<br>but the fact that we have missing<br>markets<br>means that there are<br>some ways potentially local government<br>or central government can<br>help<br>to create or to facilitate these missing<br>markets<br>local and central government certainly<br>have a massive role to play when it<br>comes to<br>getting the pricing right for both<br>carbon and for<br>waste disposal<br>there's also a role for consumers<br>consumers need to be<br>better informed to make their choices<br>about goods that they want to purchase<br>and why<br>and a very simple solution might be to<br>simply<br>put on every piece of packaging that we<br>buy<br>the carbon content that's gone into<br>making those products so that people are<br>aware of what amount of carbon<br>they are effectively<br>um<br>allowing to be created on their behalf<br>um and along with changing the prices of<br>goods<br>so if carbon were more expensive then it<br>would have an implication for the price<br>of goods but also seeing how much carbon<br>you're effectively<br>your consumption of that good has<br>created would likely change the behavior<br>of<br>um consumers<br>now our work so far on ami amir ataroa<br>this circular economy<br>research at university of waikato<br>has<br>shown that these missing markets and<br>pricing effects<br>are inhibiting development of the<br>circular economy<br>but we've also<br>examined and found evidence that we<br>don't need<br>central planning to create<br>a circular economy<br>and the evidence so far suggests that<br>new zealand ministries<br>that are being encouraged to take<br>responsibility for circular economy<br>have different views about what circular<br>economy might mean<br>and don't necessarily want to be the<br>custodians of all things circular<br>so i think there's a role for<br>governments we think there's a role for<br>governments<br>but that role for government should be<br>more about dealing with missing markets<br>and dealing with prices<br>than assuming that they can actually<br>determine what production processes<br>businesses should it should actually<br>themselves undertake<br>now i'll leave things um with that for<br>the moment thank you frank for giving me<br>the time to raise some issues about the<br>thank you<br>there's really<br>great to hear your contribution and and<br>the challenge of how we uh get those<br>missing markets filled um<br>in a timely manner in an efficient<br>manner as soon as possible<br>of course one of the other issues which<br>is important for us in<br>the light of cop 26 is the whole issue<br>of green finance and mobilizing finance<br>to achieve the goals that we have<br>and this of course is an issue in iatro<br>new zealand it's also<br>a global issue and<br>so<br>it's with great pleasure that i invite<br>dr<br>mercy kiramu to speak to us and give us<br>some insights from her work on<br>green finance and particularly her<br>insights<br>in relation to africa so thank you merci<br>okay thank you very much<br>so i'm going to talk about um climate<br>finance uh mostly informed from<br>uh the the research that i did when i<br>was at the university of waikato<br>and so my research was mainly about<br>using climate finance instruments for to<br>finance agriculture in<br>in kenya<br>and it was about looking at the links<br>that exist uh between the climate<br>finance that's available<br>and the agricultural opportunities that<br>we have uh in kenya and if there is a<br>way we can<br>channel the climate finance uh towards<br>agriculture and so we looked at uh uh<br>pricing uh<br>of weather derivatives<br>uh while i was doing this there are a<br>few things that are<br>that uh you know we i got to know<br>uh which are uh for most businesses or<br>if we want to mobilize uh climate<br>finance we have to look at the risk<br>aspect<br>especially if we are looking at it from<br>uh the private the private sector<br>because at the end of the day if we are<br>expecting people to invest in climate<br>smart uh investments for them it's about<br>the risks and the opportunities that<br>they get like the risk that is involved<br>in the investment and<br>the<br>returns that they get from that<br>so if there's no if the risks are high<br>and the returns are low then it doesn't<br>uh it's not a good incentive for them to<br>to invest in those opportunities<br>and so there are a few projects that<br>have been um<br>that uh we we reviewed while we were<br>doing this work and one of the projects<br>uh that was quite interesting was the<br>climate lab uh initiative in kenya<br>whereby<br>they head on a program whereby the<br>financing of<br>some of those climate smart<br>opportunities agricultural opportunities<br>was done by<br>uh<br>like<br>giving the loans to people who are<br>engaging in agricultural practices that<br>are enhancing uh climate resilience so<br>as part of<br>the<br>the creditor evaluation process the<br>people who were given that money or<br>given the loan<br>had to<br>uh<br>implement uh<br>some of those uh<br>climate smart uh practices in their<br>agricultural practices for them to get<br>uh the loan<br>and the loan was<br>because uh those<br>this came about because uh those<br>practices are costly it's much cheaper<br>to<br>just use the normal way of farming as<br>leave up some space between where you're<br>the last place where you do your farming<br>and the river it's much it's much more<br>profitable to farm on the entire land<br>which you know leads to more soil<br>erosion and things like that but then if<br>we are<br>if we uh provide financing to<br>uh investments that are looking after<br>the environment then in that way we can<br>direct the investments into those<br>climate smart<br>investments the other thing uh<br>was making<br>creating awareness about the<br>opportunities that are available in<br>terms of financing<br>and<br>linking the finance to<br>even the smallest of the farmers uh in<br>the economy and in uh one of the<br>projects that uh we looked at was the<br>kilima salama uh project kiliman means<br>farming salama means safe in swahili so<br>it was it's about safe farming whereby<br>they used the weather derivatives and um<br>so if the rainfall was lower than a<br>certain predetermined level the farmers<br>would get a refund for<br>based on some calculations that were<br>done<br>and it was made easier and effective in<br>that it was paid using<br>the mobile banking services whereby the<br>the farmer did not have to because there<br>has been a history of mistrust between<br>uh the people and the insurance sector<br>whereby they feel like you you buy<br>insurance but when they<br>when the incident happens the<br>probability of getting refunded is not<br>so good so<br>when they use the weather derivatives<br>the process was made easier for the<br>farmers to get a refund<br>if or to get compensated if the rainfall<br>was at a lower level and that works<br>towards creating trust between the<br>institutions and the farmers on the<br>other hand<br>the other thing that we looked at was<br>the issue of<br>the financial risk as a result of<br>climate change<br>so here we're looking at um<br>if we continue for example if we<br>continue doing things as we're doing now<br>and there is some changes in regulation<br>that requires us to move to using<br>equipment that are<br>that are climate smart then it means as<br>a business or as a person who is engaged<br>in that business you'll be left with<br>some assets that you cannot use<br>and that's because um<br>the the<br>the known the normal way of doing<br>business has been stopped so for example<br>if i<br>link it to maybe call production if<br>you're producing call and you have<br>equipments that are<br>involved in doing that<br>then if there is a law that says we<br>cannot produce call anymore it means all<br>the equipments that you had all the<br>assets that you had you you have them<br>but you cannot get any benefit out of<br>those assets so the question is how do<br>we deal with that<br>without because<br>uh that poses a risk to the businesses<br>uh how do we help our businesses and<br>even farmers to transition to the<br>climate smart practices without having<br>them suffering a very big loss<br>thank you<br>mercy<br>it is really interesting to uh grapple<br>with the challenges of uh climate<br>finance both in africa and<br>and in other places and it becomes<br>particularly important as minister shaw<br>has announced that the new zealand<br>government wishes to<br>invest more money offshore and<br>facilitating<br>appropriate climate investments and and<br>so<br>your research is uh<br>important thank you<br>okay thank you<br>i now um move on to invite uh<br>player keenan to speak to us claire<br>comes to us with his wealth of<br>experience with uh waikato regional<br>council<br>and not only his<br>wider council experience but his more<br>specific<br>interests and expertise in relation to<br>climate change and policy<br>responses so it's with great pleasure i<br>welcome you player to<br>my fellow panelists and uh and to the<br>event organizers and tena tata katoa<br>to those who are watching<br>um i'm the principal economist at the<br>waikato regional council<br>i grew up in otago but for the last 12<br>years i've lived in the waikato region<br>nourished by the owa and in the shelter<br>of<br>the maunga of the region<br>today i want to take a little bit of a<br>step back<br>um and and talk about<br>um how we make decisions<br>um<br>in this space and how policy and<br>economics interact<br>because climate change is the<br>challenge for our generation<br>um i think<br>both in terms of policy and economics<br>and we all need to be pulling in the<br>now there's an old adage in the um<br>in the policy world that you can only<br>manage what you can measure<br>now i don't know if that's strictly true<br>but<br>um in the climate change context<br>um we need to think about<br>well what does that mean um what are we<br>trying to measure and<br>um and how do you do that<br>and once you work those things out what<br>do you do about it<br>now if you'll bear with me for a minute<br>um i want to talk about gross domestic<br>product<br>or gdp which is is a way that we've<br>often used for measuring<br>now gdp is well and good for for what it<br>was designed to do<br>um it was it was<br>a measure that was designed in the 1930s<br>um<br>when the the primary policy problem of<br>the day was mass unemployment and it's<br>actually very good<br>at measuring<br>the kinds of activities that create jobs<br>so if that's your goal then gdp is<br>actually a really good measure<br>most people have been paying attention<br>um know that gdp misses a whole lot of<br>other things i mean it's not well suited<br>for dealing with<br>uh some of the problems that we're<br>facing today like<br>how we deal with the costs of of carbon<br>emissions<br>uh damage to nature<br>loss of ecosystems<br>so in the 1990s this led an economist<br>called robert costanza<br>and a bunch of his colleagues<br>to try and put a value on the earth's<br>ecosystem services<br>they<br>they came up with a figure of something<br>like 33 trillion<br>dollars<br>which was quite a lot higher than<br>gdp<br>now as as many people have noted<br>this is a mighty lowball estimate for<br>what's effectively something of infinite<br>value<br>and others<br>have pointed out that um trying to put a<br>dollar figure on this is is just<br>um morally wrong<br>and and those are<br>um those are valid points<br>but i think the point that costanza and<br>co were trying to make<br>is that um that essentially nature<br>underpins<br>everything we do<br>and<br>unless we understand<br>um<br>what we're doing<br>um<br>then<br>and and how those things can damage<br>or destroy<br>so much of the value that our economy is<br>based on is built on<br>um<br>then<br>then we put all that at risk so we need<br>to build into our decision-making<br>um about what we produce<br>how we produce it<br>otherwise we're jeopardizing not just<br>our financial wealth our incomes<br>but our lives and the lives of those to<br>come<br>now even though that was<br>more than 20 years ago now that that<br>work was done<br>we're still effectively making decisions<br>by accident in a lot of cases<br>we're failing to incorporate all those<br>costs of our actions<br>on the environment<br>and one particular problem is the way<br>that<br>we've misunderstood risk and uncertainty<br>and the the asymmetric nature of the<br>risk so we might assess a particular<br>decision or a policy or a business<br>project<br>and look at the benefits of it but we<br>don't<br>think very clearly about<br>its contribution to potentially the<br>infinite downsides<br>so we need to get a far better way of<br>understanding how systems work<br>not just linear processes<br>otherwise we end up with<br>unintended consequences<br>on a global scale which is what we're<br>facing at the moment<br>and i think we do have the tools<br>the circular economy that professor<br>oxley described earlier<br>um and some really practical stuff um as<br>the treasury's living standards<br>framework which just came out an updated<br>version of it came out a week ago<br>with its recognition of of nature and<br>culture and how how those should be<br>incorporated into our decisions<br>and i think another one is the belated<br>realization of what mataranga maori<br>has to teach us and bring to<br>our decision making<br>even the the local government act<br>which is what i<br>work under a lot<br>and and the much aligned resource<br>management act<br>um with their emphasis on on the four<br>well-beings<br>on future generation<br>uh and on indigenous voices<br>um<br>they've got the the bones there for<br>making good decisions<br>but we need to interpret those things<br>and implement them<br>um throughout a lens of our values<br>rather than our short-term interests<br>and then i think together we can we can<br>tell good policy<br>um but we do need to recognize that<br>it's not cost costless it won't be<br>costless<br>and in order for us to all uh be better<br>off in the end there will be those that<br>lose out<br>in terms of their short-term interests<br>so we need to understand<br>that that is what's driving um<br>a lot of the the policy in action that<br>we see<br>and that's that's again where a<br>contribution that i think economics can<br>make<br>but economics can help us to understand<br>what those costs are going to look like<br>who they fall on uh how we can help that<br>process move and remove<br>that<br>roadblock to policy in action<br>how we can minimize those costs<br>and still save the world at the same<br>time<br>thank you blair<br>what a great<br>place to end<br>on in terms of uh<br>reducing the roadblocks blocks<br>minimizing<br>the costs<br>and saving<br>the world bringing the three together<br>now we<br>move on um<br>to<br>for me to introduce<br>rongo kirkwood<br>and before she starts i i just<br>acknowledged that<br>we've<br>talked about<br>mobilizing finance and we've talked<br>about things in africa and things far<br>away but also<br>issues much closer<br>to home<br>and the other observation that i would<br>make is that um sometimes it's very easy<br>to um<br>think about the decisions that are made<br>in far away places like<br>glasgow or<br>or wellington<br>but there are also decisions that we can<br>make and do make and get<br>made much closer to home and so it's<br>with real pleasure rongo we welcome you<br>to<br>thank you uh for the invitation at<br>wakato university for inviting us to<br>contribute to this conversation um we're<br>really really privileged to be part of<br>this<br>so<br>and i want to make you to linda<br>to lead into mercy and for blair and for<br>sharing<br>the conversations that you've just<br>my sacred river is waikato<br>my ancestral canoe is tynery my tribe is<br>waikato maniapoto<br>and my home is<br>here and my name is rongo kirkwood<br>i've just shared with you<br>a papa<br>or genetically connect<br>to<br>my environment and my people<br>and i wish i could spend more time in<br>sharing more<br>however<br>i belong to a philanthropic organization<br>called te punao waikato<br>trust baikato<br>is a community trust<br>that serves the people of the waikato<br>region<br>in old tierra<br>and i'm hoping that<br>you would have seen an image of my home<br>uh through the presentation<br>truswekato<br>has a commitment to improve<br>environmental outcomes<br>the trust is a signatory to the<br>principles for responsible investment<br>that focuses investment risk assessment<br>through an esg<br>lens or a environmental social and<br>governance lens<br>to reduce our carbon footprint<br>the trust has also developed a climate<br>change commitment<br>in climate change framework<br>our sustainability commitment<br>acknowledges that human induced climate<br>change poses a serious and immediate<br>risk to our communities<br>and that urgent action<br>is required<br>to avoid catastrophic effects for our<br>people and environment<br>we believe trustwaikato<br>that we have a role to play in<br>mitigating the most severe impacts of<br>climate change and that we need to work<br>together to develop a resilient<br>community response in order to ensure<br>true kaitiakitanga or guardianship of<br>our resources for future generations<br>the effects of climate change will not<br>be felt<br>equally amongst our community and we<br>need to mitigate the inequality of these<br>impacts<br>trustwaikato is committed to becoming a<br>climate leader<br>to enable a low emissions future<br>this will be done by actioning our<br>climate change framework<br>grant making<br>we aim to understand the impact that<br>grants make to reduce climate change<br>and to provide support to the community<br>to understand and reduce their own<br>climate emissions<br>our operations<br>we will develop<br>transparent and measurable actions<br>in reporting to reduce climate change<br>emissions<br>that result from the operational<br>activity of trust waikato<br>investment portfolios<br>by evaluating the impacts of just<br>wakasha's investments we will reduce the<br>climate change emissions of the trust<br>investment portfolios<br>so<br>what's some examples of the commitments<br>that we've<br>done already<br>so with our grant making<br>we see our role as connectors<br>we can connect transformational leaders<br>from our communities to come together<br>and facilitate conversations<br>on how each of us have a role to play<br>and significantly reducing our carbon<br>emissions and implementing collective<br>action<br>we had<br>knowledge that tangata fenu<br>maori have a significant role to play in<br>the space<br>and need to be involved in conversations<br>and initiatives from the start<br>so our call for action is<br>philanthropic organizations<br>you know consider and you need to ensure<br>that any call for action needs to<br>involve indigenous peoples from the<br>beginning<br>operations<br>internally we have implemented a<br>comprehensive internal review of our<br>operational activities and identified<br>key areas that we will<br>that will assist us to reduce our carbon<br>emissions<br>externally we have implemented a pilot<br>project with some of the communities<br>we fund to undertake into their own<br>internal views of the operational<br>activities and we are<br>working on extending this project to<br>include our wider philanthropic<br>sector starting with our own whanau of<br>a call for action for philanthropic<br>organizations is that we need to lead by<br>so um in closing<br>investment portfolios we are aligning<br>with the paris court and looking at our<br>and looking at aligning our frameworks<br>with the paris accord initiatives and in<br>closing the same snippet on how<br>philanthropy and aotearoa can contribute<br>secure<br>that that's<br>really uh<br>exciting as we consider the<br>the opportunities and responsibilities<br>of philanthropic organizations in<br>community<br>organizations<br>sometimes it's easy to<br>hold a yardstick up to greenpeace and<br>say this greenpeace uh<br>um live what it talks but that same<br>yardstick needs to be held to a saw<br>and it's not just a sort of a<br>a harsh yardstick but it's an empowering<br>um challenge to us<br>how we can do better<br>and uh clearly<br>community justice is leading the way<br>thank you<br>so now we have um the opportunity to<br>respond to any of the<br>messages that<br>other panelists have<br>contributed today and so<br>i will um start with less and then go to<br>mercy then to blair and back to<br>congo for the final word<br>liz do you have any um observations that<br>you would like to<br>share with us in terms of your reactions<br>to uh the contributions of other<br>thank you frank i think the<br>the discussion on<br>um what i might describe as as green<br>finance<br>is is really an important excuse me an<br>important issue<br>in moving forward<br>and that green finance could be either<br>private sector based as we as we heard<br>um or it could be philanthropic or it<br>could be<br>public sector encouraged as well<br>i think there are all of these outlets<br>are going to be important and and<br>already consumers<br>and those who are contributing to saving<br>schemes<br>are putting their money where their<br>mouth is and wanting to know much more<br>about the the investment portfolios<br>uh where their money is being invested<br>and i think that this is a you know a<br>very powerful tool<br>going going forward<br>and i<br>i acknowledge<br>our local philanthropic organizations<br>have a huge role<br>often a role that is um<br>not as<br>high profile<br>as as it maybe should be in this respect<br>but but leading from the front<br>in terms of uh comments on on what blair<br>has said<br>i i certainly agree that we we have the<br>tools<br>i think that<br>one issue<br>that that really um<br>is at the forefront is is really about<br>time scales<br>and the central government<br>um if you want to put it in the<br>technical sense of the different<br>discount rate to local government and it<br>just gets different discount rate when<br>it comes to the planet and that relying<br>on central government to take these<br>initiatives<br>i think is one which is<br>um<br>if not doomed to failure is one that is<br>not optimal<br>and<br>clearly when i talked about carbon being<br>too too cheap<br>i think politically it's too cheap<br>um<br>so politically it would be too expensive<br>for them to enact the sorts of policies<br>that would be required to give the<br>correct<br>signal<br>about the required price of carbon<br>um so i think that relying on central<br>governments to to solve our problems our<br>climate problems is um<br>not only risky but i think it's starting<br>from the the wrong end<br>so i enjoyed all presentations thank you<br>all of you for making it's a very strong<br>and business ways of arguments<br>thank you frank<br>thank you liz we'll jump straight to<br>mercy<br>okay<br>so i'd like to<br>say that i enjoyed the presentations<br>from<br>from the rest of the team<br>one of the things that stood out to me<br>was<br>that we need to<br>to try to shift the focus from<br>short-term profits to the long-term uh<br>profits and benefits<br>which<br>most of the organizations especially<br>from an accounting perspective we are<br>not able to include that<br>as part of our financial reporting<br>so we need to have a way to have that<br>incorporated so that instead of just<br>focusing on the short-term profits we<br>can look at the wholesome<br>picture<br>and that could involve<br>community engagement like<br>we had<br>how the communities are getting engaged<br>in<br>in the climate change<br>landscape<br>because<br>the community's perspective is more of<br>how to<br>live a good inheritance for the people<br>who come after<br>so there is need to partner between the<br>businesses the community and the<br>and the government in order to come up<br>with a solution because<br>this challenge cannot be managed from<br>just one single perspective alone<br>thank<br>you<br>thank you<br>mercy<br>blair would you like to respond<br>i'm sure<br>and first of all um<br>i also very much enjoyed all three<br>presentations and found them all quite<br>encouraging um<br>that you know in in the different<br>respects<br>i said at the beginning of my my<br>earlier um talk that um<br>you know the old adage that you can only<br>manage what you can measure<br>um<br>but i think that<br>um you know with the points that that<br>liz has just made<br>um<br>we can't we're not in a position where<br>we can wait<br>so that that we can measure everything<br>um to the degree that we might like to<br>we really need<br>because we know that that we need to act<br>and i agree that<br>the government certainly isn't the be<br>all and end or we can't rely on it to<br>fix these problems um and it does<br>and need to involve the community and<br>business and<br>um indigenous voices<br>um all of these things<br>um it put me in mind<br>the response in america<br>to world war ii when they found<br>themselves<br>completely unprepared<br>for the challenges that they faced when<br>they suddenly found themselves thrust<br>and what what president roosevelt did at<br>the time<br>was<br>um<br>he mobilized the whole country<br>through his leadership uh he got in<br>the head of sies roebuck which is a big<br>retailing<br>outfit to organize logistics<br>he got<br>the head of gm<br>and chrysler<br>and<br>and u.s steel<br>and mobilized all of those different<br>resources<br>who were good at doing stuff that needed<br>to be done at the time<br>and and i think that's a really good<br>example of<br>how<br>if we have the will and work together<br>we can<br>switch things around quite quickly when<br>thanks<br>turn things around<br>that is uh<br>the challenge so that we don't<br>continue on the pathway of an ever<br>increasing warming<br>earth<br>it is great to have these uh<br>contributions today<br>and i'm going to give<br>rongo the opportunity to have the last<br>word in our<br>panel today but before i<br>give her<br>that opportunity to<br>provide the final<br>word<br>i<br>observe<br>you know it is an ongoing challenge<br>isn't it to<br>make<br>good decisions<br>at multiple levels on the basis of<br>limited information<br>but limited information um you know<br>information's always been limited<br>in every area of life and<br>we don't wait till we've<br>got a phd before we uh<br>you know learn to drive a car<br>we<br>we make choices along the way and i<br>think part of<br>the challenge<br>for us and for our governments and our<br>other organizations is to use the<br>organizations that we have<br>and to use the relationships that we<br>have<br>and to uh<br>energetically<br>and uh<br>and with engagement work together to<br>address the bigger<br>challenge<br>so we'll bring this session to a close<br>with ronbo so thank you panelists and<br>um one of the most valuable things that<br>i've got from our session is our<br>engagement with each other i have to say<br>and<br>in closing what does that look like so<br>i'm going to refer to<br>so what does that mean that means your<br>contribution<br>everyone's contribution<br>will um and all the efforts that we have<br>will<br>ensure<br>that the work will be done and will be<br>continued and will continue to get done<br>in in the manner that it should be so um<br>once again thank you very much for the<br>opportunity to um yeah contribute to the<br>space the university of waikato is proud<br>to introduce the world's
