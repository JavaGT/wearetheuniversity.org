series<br>the<br>wellington school of business and<br>government funded chairs serious on<br>sustainable development goals and it's a<br>great pleasure to have associate<br>professor jane bolito who is now able<br>to talk to us after only arriving into<br>new zealand earlier in the year and it's<br>great to see so much interest<br>from both people in the university and<br>outside the university in this topic<br>so the topic<br>for today is restorative roadmaps for<br>the promotion of peaceful and inclusive<br>societies and justice for all<br>um<br>jane is the diana unwin chair in<br>restorative justice one of our founder<br>chairs<br>arrived earlier in the year and is now<br>already making quite an impact with some<br>of the exciting work she's doing<br>she will speak specifically<br>sorry this always happens she will speak<br>specifically to sdg 16 peace justice and<br>strong institutions<br>and hopefully that link is somewhat<br>somewhat clear<br>and with just this brief introduction<br>and a little bit of context i would like<br>thank you christian uh can you can<br>tennoco two called jane oh ho balaitha<br>te whanau uh kanui tamihi kiyakoto<br>tenekotu tenakotu tena kotukato<br>hello and welcome to everybody listening<br>many listeners will not realize but it's<br>actually international international<br>restorative justice week which is<br>celebrated globally<br>um just a wonderful coincidence in<br>timing<br>so happy restorative justice week to all<br>of us<br>i'm so pleased to have this opportunity<br>to talk about the un sustainable<br>development goal 16<br>and to reflect on restorative justice<br>and how our work in the diana unwin<br>chair progresses this goal<br>there are many positive aspects to our<br>work that i will share but i have<br>applied a quite critical lens to the<br>role and scope of the chair and by the<br>end you'll see that<br>there are more questions than answers<br>and although somewhat uncomfortable<br>these questions provide the impetus for<br>shaping our next steps<br>the presentation will move through three<br>parts<br>in the first section we'll look at the<br>sustainable development goal 16 sdg 16.<br>in the second i will outline my<br>understanding of restorative<br>which will give us a common context for<br>considering its potential in working<br>towards the goal<br>in the third part i will take a step<br>back<br>in the third part i'll take a step back<br>and consider the chairs role within the<br>unique context of our terraroa and i<br>will contextualize our achievements<br>within the bigger picture of human<br>rights in this country<br>so that's a bit of a road map for the<br>presentation<br>it will go for about 30 minutes so<br>there's a little bit of time left over<br>for some discussion<br>i have assumed that in the audience<br>there are people that know nothing about<br>restorative and some who some who will<br>have a very deep knowledge and perhaps<br>even for some<br>for whom restorative is something that<br>they have experienced as a participant<br>so i've pitched the presentation<br>to balance these different starting<br>points<br>sdg 16<br>to promote peaceful and inclusive<br>societies<br>to provide access to justice for all<br>to build effective accountable and<br>inclusive institutions at all levels<br>the first part of sdg 16<br>is leveled at the functioning of society<br>it's not assumed that conflict harm<br>wrongdoing and crime doesn't occur after<br>all um the sociologist emile durkheim<br>noted that if we tried to imagine a<br>society of saints we couldn't it would<br>be impossible because even were we to<br>live amongst angels<br>when living in community the most minute<br>of differences would eventually be<br>noticed leading to labeling of that<br>difference and then depending up<br>depending on the extent of that<br>difference being perceived as<br>problematic or harmful the process of<br>othering would occur as with the<br>development of a shared sense of norm<br>violation and possibly then a<br>distinction or label of criminal<br>so from noticing difference to the<br>labeling of events is harmful and then<br>harmful enough to criminalize this is a<br>universal human activity<br>even with harm and crime being<br>subjective terms hurtful activities<br>whether given the label of criminal or<br>not will always exist<br>but a marker of the moral well-being of<br>our society is how much and of what kind<br>of harm<br>hurt and crime is occurring and how<br>often and to whom and then to which<br>methods do we turn to to address these<br>harms<br>the second part of sdg 16 providing<br>access to justice for all has three<br>important ideas<br>justice is a very complex word that has<br>everyday meanings and connotations as<br>well as a legal frame and then there are<br>even higher level meanings to the world<br>justice that philosophers like to use<br>when i'm trying to tackle the big moral<br>dilemmas of our times<br>so just taking an everyday understanding<br>of justice it's fair to say that the<br>human need for the writing of wrongs<br>exists<br>using a legal lens justice in the in the<br>form of some kind of accountability is<br>important to the right functioning of<br>our community and so we have a legal<br>system<br>i often use the term legal system<br>because the term criminal justice system<br>suggests that justice is enacted every<br>time and this is not necessarily the<br>case<br>even if you were to have the best<br>justice system in the world you still<br>have to be able to access that space so<br>the second idea in this part of scg-16<br>is that your ability to access justice<br>your capacity to find a pathway to the<br>space which addresses harm it matters a<br>good deal<br>here is where i think a link between the<br>higher level philosophical debates on<br>justice are useful specifically i'm<br>interested in the work of amateur sen<br>and martha news form and the so-called<br>capabilities approach<br>the capabilities approach is congruent<br>with the human rights framework but<br>instead of asking which rights exist and<br>mapping those the existence of those<br>rights to jurisdiction<br>it drills down to the actual<br>capabilities of each person to enjoy<br>rights and freedoms and including<br>justice<br>this might sound quite individualistic<br>but we can use the capability approach<br>the capability framework to look at<br>patterns of access<br>by attributes such as race ethnicity<br>gender sexuality and disability<br>so that's a bit of a higher level point<br>in a more operational or practical sense<br>the legal and justice practitioners and<br>workers in the audience will be familiar<br>with the idea or notion of a justice<br>funnel<br>across the globe and in this country it<br>is a fact that many crimes are not<br>detected many crimes will not be<br>reported many cases do not proceed to<br>prosecution and of those that do only a<br>fraction will end in a finding of guilt<br>being of course only an issue if the<br>crime did actually occur so a false<br>negative<br>i'm sure many lawyers in the audience<br>are kind of muttering ah the law is the<br>law<br>but from a human perspective this<br>funneling of matters through the<br>criminal justice apparatus of police and<br>the courts and sentencing leaves many<br>instances of harm at least they simply<br>not attended to<br>now this would be fine if we only cared<br>about the legal truth and if we knew<br>that this funneling was a natural and<br>right filtering of all matters<br>unfortunately that funnel is more<br>prominent for some kinds of crimes than<br>others and in turn crime affects some<br>people and some groups of people more<br>than others and the attributes that<br>determine the likelihood rest on<br>intersections around age gender race<br>ethnicity sexuality socioeconomic status<br>neurotypical<br>neurotypicalness and so forth so<br>technically while we're equal in the<br>eyes of the law it is not the case that<br>we are equally likely to be impacted by<br>harmful crime nor do we have in reality<br>equal access to the mechanisms that<br>bring so-called justice<br>so there is some complexity to the<br>second part of sdg 16.<br>the third component of sdg building<br>effective accountable and inclusive<br>institutions it reminds us that since<br>the industrial revolution organizations<br>bureaucracies and institutions have come<br>to hold an immense power in the shaping<br>of our lives from birth to death from<br>hospitals to education and schools to<br>workplaces to the institutions that we<br>rely on for access to resources<br>and support in times of need to our<br>formal justice institutions our law<br>police courts and prisons<br>well-functioning institutions<br>support well-functioning communities and<br>people in recent times<br>though in australia where i'm from and<br>uh in new zealand we see royal<br>commission after royal commission<br>questioning the functioning of these<br>these um these very important<br>institutions we are seeing right now the<br>product of hurt and harmed people harmed<br>under the watch of our most trusted<br>institutions i've just popped a few of<br>them up here on the powerpoint by no<br>means all of them<br>in new zealand the royal commission the<br>royal commission inquiry into abusing<br>care<br>to have children and young people in<br>care being abused is is really quite<br>devastating news indeed<br>um not least<br>not least there is an additional aspect<br>to it which in in in the criminal<br>justice sphere is understood between um<br>to be around the care and crime nexus<br>those coming into our care system end up<br>in the criminal justice system so to<br>know that there is abuse as well it is<br>compounding many compounding harms<br>the australian defense abuse task force<br>or the dart model as it was known as<br>established in 2012 looked at all of the<br>issues of abuse not just sexual abuse<br>physical abuse any abuse up until 2011<br>2500 complaints were made 700<br>restorative engagements were completed<br>we've got<br>a royal commission into institutional<br>child sexual abuse we've got a royal<br>commission into detentions detention<br>centers we've got a royal commission<br>into banking superannuation and finance<br>we've got a royal commission into the<br>aged care sector<br>and most recently i read of in victoria<br>in australia<br>um<br>a redress scheme being set up to address<br>the systemic gender and sexual<br>harassment claims within um the<br>victorian police system<br>now the fact that our institutions are<br>being questioned and held to account<br>means that there's no shortage of work<br>for people like me in the restorative<br>justice sphere we've picked up a lot of<br>work<br>yet another sphere along the same lines<br>is developing which is around us working<br>with sporting institutions and<br>organizations that have enabled abuse<br>of sports people including at the very<br>elite level where there's been<br>government oversight these kinds of<br>matters are congruent with what the us<br>olympic gymnast simone files uh brought<br>to the world of attention in tokyo<br>earlier this year<br>one of my kiwi colleagues asked me<br>recently if there was something wrong<br>with the australian culture that so much<br>institutional abuse was occurring<br>but i don't think that it's endemic of<br>australia it's it's the result of a<br>confluence of factors including um the<br>rise of social media and things like the<br>metoo movement which are fueled by<br>people power and suddenly kind of having<br>a capacity to shine light on previously<br>invisible harms so i'll talk a bit later<br>about the capacity of restorative to<br>meet the unmet justice needs of harm<br>parties um through these various royal<br>commissions<br>um but um<br>but that's kind of and that's a bit of a<br>bit of an interrogation of sdg 16 i<br>suppose why is restorative justice<br>relevant to this goal well to answer<br>this question i'd like to kind of um i'd<br>like us to have a shared starting point<br>on what restorative actually is<br>okay so for me<br>uh restorative is best understood as a<br>philosophy that sparked a social<br>movement a global social movement and<br>that's and one that's really taken off<br>since the 1970s<br>the origins of the movement are diverse<br>and of course somewhat contested suffice<br>to say that since the 1970s in western<br>democratic countries with adversarial<br>legal systems restorative programs began<br>to proliferate if we were to look at<br>restorative used in the criminal context<br>today restorative justice programs of<br>some sort and or another are a formal<br>compart of pretty much every youth<br>justice system in the world<br>and nearly the same degree sitting there<br>as an option for adult offenders as well<br>now new zealand is recognized globally<br>as an absolute leader in this sphere not<br>least because of the sentencing act<br>which enabled<br>the adjournment of every eligible case<br>to restorative so it was it was an<br>opt-out rather than opt-in system<br>leading to a huge increase in the number<br>of restorative<br>referrals coming through so the sheer<br>volume of restorative initiatives along<br>with the pace of experimentation<br>globally arguably makes it the most<br>significant justice innovation that<br>we've seen in modern times<br>before going further just a quick note<br>on terminology you'll hear me using the<br>term restorative practice and the word<br>and the term restorative justice<br>while um the early writings in the field<br>related to crime and justice the ideas<br>were quickly transplanted into the civil<br>and community domain most notably in the<br>education sphere and in workplaces in<br>transitional conflict matters and then<br>more recently even to the health in into<br>health care systems<br>so it might be useful for you to imagine<br>that restorative practice is the<br>umbrella term<br>and for all of the initiatives that use<br>a restorative philosophy to address harm<br>and restorative justice is a term that<br>we use for matters that have some kind<br>of intersection with the legal system<br>restorative practice is the preferred<br>term when we're talking about strategies<br>that prevent harm proactive pieces<br>whereas restorative justice at least in<br>new zealand is a term that tends to<br>refer to reactive work that's happened<br>after a crime has occurred<br>still quite a live international debate<br>on this terminology but we don't need to<br>get too bogged down in that today our<br>work in the diana unwin chair sits<br>across all of all of these areas and so<br>we generally use restorative practice<br>the united nations defined rj back in<br>2002 in the most basic sense it's a<br>facilitated conversation between<br>somebody harmed and somebody responsible<br>or hum people harmed and people<br>responsible to complicate this a little<br>bit though restorative is more than this<br>it's a philosophy that rests on<br>particular principles or values so<br>operationally we can say that any any<br>process that um reflects the principles<br>is at least somewhat restorative um so<br>it's a continuum the core principles or<br>values on which restorative rests are<br>that every every human being has dignity<br>and worth regardless of deed<br>in restorative there's um<br>kind of optimism about the redeemability<br>of of people and while each of us has a<br>capacity to commit really heinous<br>shocking crimes leaving kind of in the<br>wake you know grief and trauma and and<br>shame and loss each of us also has a<br>capacity to to kind of be resilient and<br>to survive and to have courage and to<br>have hope for a better future<br>um another kind of authority for uh<br>value is that humans are the social and<br>relational beings that we thrive in<br>networks and and community and we suffer<br>when in isolation and<br>um and in alienation<br>if you imagine kind of like a spider's<br>web<br>um when a crime occurs it's like the<br>spider's web is being shaken and in<br>restorative the obligation is in the<br>community and the person to rebuild that<br>web is not just for the state to rectify<br>things<br>um<br>the parties to irrespective encounter<br>are given the opportunity to have a<br>direct say to have voice to have<br>communication about what happened um<br>it's not it's not mediated through any<br>professional voice it's not through the<br>lawyer not through social workers not<br>through psychologists<br>the idea is that in narrative in<br>storytelling we have we're seen and this<br>is quite different to what happens in<br>the adversarial system of course where<br>the state takes on the role of the<br>victim and we have the crown versus the<br>defendant<br>so another principle of restorative is<br>that the conversation moves in a loosely<br>structured way through what happened and<br>the impact and the way forward but any<br>agreements around what what the way<br>forward could look like would need to be<br>arrived at consensually<br>and in a very deliberative manner<br>um outcomes are never done to someone<br>they're not kind of top down they're<br>arrived at together um and they come<br>from the people that have been most<br>affected<br>another principle is that it must be<br>voluntary it's never coerced that's<br>participation that is and that there<br>must be an acknowledgement of harm from<br>the beginning and that's because<br>restorative is not a fact finding<br>mission um it's not a mechanism to<br>resolve a dispute that's what makes it<br>different from mediation in restorative<br>it's accepted that there are multiple<br>truths to an event and while a legal<br>truth may be sought or arrived at or not<br>what is important in restorative is a<br>genuine acknowledgement of some kind of<br>harm allowing them for an outcome to be<br>much more targeted personal and much to<br>kind of lead to a much deeper<br>deeper form of accountability<br>so overall restorative is a mechanism<br>for achieving justice and it's also a<br>kind of justice<br>and<br>i don't want to speak to the vast<br>literature on why restorative works just<br>very briefly the simple act of giving<br>voice um to the parties affected by harm<br>letting stories breathe is really useful<br>in healing<br>spaces that are set up in a restorative<br>way nearly always bring a perception of<br>procedural justice and there's a big<br>legal literature on on why procedural<br>justice matters<br>it's also the case that when you<br>when you create this space and you give<br>people voice there's also<br>space for very kind of careful and and<br>considered listening and in the trauma<br>literature we can talk of this as kind<br>of bearing witness to something and<br>these can feel very powerful and moving<br>and be quite transformative<br>um and then restorative also just works<br>because in looking at a person in<br>context<br>at a very practical level you can kind<br>of build evidence-based uh supports<br>around that person so<br>for both the person harmed and the<br>person responsible so that there's<br>support into the future for it not to<br>happen again and for that um there to be<br>some healing i suppose<br>now many of you listening will be well<br>familiar with the philosophy of<br>restorative but even for people like me<br>that wake up every day and think about<br>restorative the volume of restorative<br>services can make it hard to see the<br>wood for the trees<br>and that's because restorative can have<br>different names it'd be called different<br>things it can be offered in community it<br>can be offered alongside the legal<br>system it can be offered instead of the<br>adversarial system<br>in the criminal context it can be<br>diversion pre-sentencing as sentencing<br>or post-sentencing<br>it can be consist of a single meeting or<br>many meetings it can consist of a<br>face-to-face encounter or an exchange of<br>letters<br>it can begin with the needs of a victim<br>and bring in the person responsible<br>optionally or it can begin with the<br>needs of an offender and have optional<br>participation for the victim<br>it can be done with surrogate victims<br>which might be a bit of a<br>a stretch for some of you to imagine but<br>it's with the victim of a similar kind<br>of harm brought into conversation with<br>somebody responsible<br>then increasingly we see that with<br>something like abuse in care there will<br>be there is in a sense multiple persons<br>responsible and we see victims wishing<br>to have a facilitated conversation with<br>a representative of the institution<br>within which the acts occurred perhaps<br>even more than desiring a conversation<br>with a direct<br>perpetrator so a good example of this<br>came you know has been through the the<br>catholic church across the globe in many<br>many instances of child sexual abuse and<br>a number of victims have wanted to meet<br>with a church representative rather than<br>the actual perpetrator in many cases<br>deceased or um incapacity incapacitated<br>through old age<br>they wanted to meet with the<br>institutional representative because the<br>impact of the crime was not just<br>physical or emotional but um through<br>things like a loss of faith um which is<br>an important part of kind of a good life<br>so restorative um for those people so<br>restorative engagement then offers a<br>space to kind of to remedy um<br>remedy losses on many different levels<br>so the restorative field is super<br>diverse um but for me uh the beauty and<br>power of restorative is just in how<br>flexible it is as a mechanism for<br>meeting these really really diverse<br>individual and community needs<br>so i'd like to turn now to<br>considering how restorative can be used<br>to help achieve sdg 16<br>so the examples i'm going to use are<br>examples that we've had that have kind<br>of that we've worked on in the chair<br>first and in a very blunt way um the<br>existence of another pathway to justice<br>means it is very likely that more<br>justice will be done more justice will<br>be available to the community more<br>people will find a meaningful resolution<br>to matters that hurt and harm<br>having restorative as an option<br>offers a different avenue to resolution<br>it offers another avenue for those<br>matters that are reported and not taken<br>forward for prosecution it offers<br>something in the space that are for<br>those that are affected by hidden crimes<br>all of those matters which exist but<br>which aren't recognized to be criminal<br>or even detected sometimes by the<br>parties affected and for those matters<br>where there's no legal or civil recourse<br>so one example would just relate to the<br>very worrisome evidence emerging around<br>the globe and in this country around the<br>abuse and neglect of elderly elderly<br>people in nursing homes in residential<br>care but also in our homes in the<br>community abuse can be physical it can<br>be sexual it can be<br>emotional it can be financial<br>for all sorts of reasons many of these<br>matters aren't going to be taken through<br>the adversarial system yet there needs<br>to be some form of accountability and<br>certainly the behavior needs to be<br>stopped so the chair um did some really<br>interesting work on elder care and using<br>restorative to attend to these kinds of<br>harms another example that i've worked a<br>lot on in my research work would relate<br>to sexual violence which is a violent<br>crime that is um that is the least<br>likely to be reported to police probably<br>because it's a crime that's perpetrated<br>most by people<br>perpetrated most by people known to the<br>victim so partners and family<br>now i'm personally in favor of many many<br>reforms to the legal system and the<br>criminal trial around this topic<br>but<br>it doesn't mean that but<br>my experience working this field with<br>survivors<br>through that experience i've come to<br>understand that what people need and<br>want is choice and support to make<br>choice the choice that's right for them<br>at that point in time and it's a simple<br>fact that many women in particular will<br>continue to not report sexual and family<br>violence but want the behaviour to stop<br>so this is where restorative can come<br>into play<br>there are also perpetrators who would<br>like to desist<br>so even when not under the shadow of the<br>law in community i'm talking about<br>restorative can be done it is not easy<br>work it's very complex there are legal<br>tensions but there are existing<br>specialist services<br>wonderful example in this country being<br>project restored this is absolutely a<br>step in the right direction in terms of<br>access to justice for all<br>a different aspect on sexual offending<br>relates to the rehabilitative options<br>available to perpetrators of which there<br>are fewer than what you might expect<br>you know there are so many causes of<br>sexual offending we have a tendency to<br>lump them all in together<br>often into the category of irredeemable<br>um and many restorative services will<br>simply exclude any sexual offending<br>matters yet one of the few areas in<br>restorative where randomized controlled<br>trials have been done is around a<br>particular form of a study done for<br>offenders called circles of support and<br>accountability of cosa models<br>we don't uh we're not following the<br>evidence based on this one um<br>whether it's through the perceived risk<br>or the distress people have with this<br>topic<br>yet an inclusive society means<br>supporting people to not reoffend we<br>know that our prisons don't help us here<br>so we must use the evidence<br>another example that we're doing a lot<br>of work on in the chair is in the health<br>sphere the health group in our team uh<br>work to address unexpected outcomes or<br>adverse events whether they're one-off<br>or um such as in the kind of tragic<br>cases of stillbirth or multiple<br>instances where a whole a whole cohort<br>of people are impacted or systemic harms<br>resulting from ongoing organisational<br>changes a major piece completed with the<br>health quality safety commission for the<br>ministry of health concerned surgical<br>mesh<br>for those where complications arose<br>after surgical mesh implantation and the<br>impact on everyday life was immense for<br>these um for these people immense and<br>ongoing serious losses to physical<br>well-being relationships identity<br>emotional and financial implications and<br>also a loss of trust in health care<br>providers so that project supported over<br>600 mesh injured people to share their<br>stories and space was also created for<br>family of people affected to have some<br>voice and to get um to gain some<br>acknowledgement of that harm so this<br>restorative engagement work not only<br>provided an avenue for voice but also<br>shaped in a reform agenda<br>for the health system to prevent future<br>events and so a wonderful short film<br>that was released on this project just<br>moving to point two it's also the case<br>that um<br>all of those are examples of restorative<br>bringing us access to justice but<br>restorative also works to achieve the<br>promotion of peaceful and inclusive<br>society by giving us a way to attend<br>everything that's left over after a<br>complaint or dispute resolution or a<br>legal adversarial finding has been made<br>so even when there is a guilty finding<br>at court or a dispute is settled or a<br>claim is assessed and technically<br>resolved time and time again we hear<br>that the human needs of harmed parties<br>are not met in the legal system<br>many many victims need information about<br>what happened and why many people need<br>to negotiate safety particularly if<br>they're going to see each other again<br>many victims need to be believed to be<br>seen and to be heard so restorative<br>justice can meet these unmet needs of<br>all of all of all of those affected by<br>harm regardless of what finality a legal<br>truth can offer<br>so one very small example of a project<br>that we've done in the justice sphere<br>related to the contribution um to the<br>work programme work program of<br>tangata a program that brings some<br>restorative principles to the experience<br>of youth detention<br>working off the principle of course that<br>youth's attention um is a legal reality<br>but not something that meets human needs<br>um and finally point three restorative<br>can offer us a tool to prevent harm<br>happening in the first place so this<br>very squarely then helps us achieve goal<br>sdg 16. here at this university which is<br>a restorative university there's been<br>some really amazing innovative work<br>in the residential halls<br>the pilot was called the sustained<br>restorative dialogue program aimed at<br>really preventing sexual violence<br>occurring on campus through co-designing<br>conversations that matter with residents<br>of the halls<br>educating around sexuality educating for<br>consent and pathways to support if harm<br>occurred so in all these ways um<br>theoretically and practically the<br>restorative yeah restorative works to<br>the goals of sdg 16<br>so you know on a positive note um the<br>diana unwin chair you know we we support<br>restorative work from birth through to<br>death we support the use of restorative<br>and community as well as services that<br>are kind of<br>enmeshed in our government systems<br>and we support work done in<br>organizations and we support proactive<br>work as well as reactive work and all of<br>these pieces of work you know i'm super<br>proud of and really happy to talk of<br>them<br>but<br>while um while our projects contribute<br>positively to new zealand if i were to<br>kind of stand back and consider the<br>broader picture a number of indicators<br>point to us failing<br>there are differential outcomes<br>for people in this country in terms of<br>health education employment housing<br>transition and a gross over<br>representation of maori that are<br>incarcerated<br>just last week i read a report on the<br>new zealand human rights commission<br>website and it's still on the front page<br>which found that maori and pacifica<br>women face disproportional periods of<br>segregation in new zealand prisons with<br>93 of segregations in prison lasting for<br>more than 15 days this is actually this<br>actually constitutes torture according<br>to the united nations so if we consider<br>that women in prison have complex health<br>needs resulting from being in care often<br>as children and many with histories of<br>sexual abuse intergenerational trauma<br>comes to mind and this situation is just<br>not acceptable<br>so meaningful work towards goal 16 must<br>be predicated theoretically and<br>practically on meaningful interrogation<br>of our obligations to uphold the treaty<br>of waitangi and a meaningfulness<br>assessment of whether those obligations<br>are being upheld an over-representation<br>of maori in prison and of mario with<br>wealth worse health or employment<br>trajectories is a signifier to us that<br>all is not well<br>if it is the case that many new zealand<br>scholars have argued that the genuine<br>intent of iwie and harpoo when signing<br>the um when signing to tariti and the<br>understood meaning of the treaty is now<br>um<br>and uh and the understood meaning of the<br>training is now overlooked through<br>ignorance or purposeful disregard we<br>have a moral imperative to rectify this<br>saying that we're in uh saying that<br>we're operating in a treaty-led fashion<br>is also not quite enough because of<br>these first nation concerns about these<br>different constitutional understandings<br>at play<br>so therefore the work that we must<br>engage in is the task of what many white<br>settler folk um<br>like myself have termed decolonization<br>noting though that those such as moana<br>jackson<br>in this country have pointed out that<br>first nation scholars do not need pakaha<br>like me to to frame the issue or to<br>label it moana jackson suggests an<br>alternative language for this piece<br>which for him is termed an ethics of<br>restoration which is rebalancing towards<br>what ought to be and to working to what<br>was actually intended when erie and harp<br>who signed the treaty<br>so for someone like me in a very<br>privileged position with many resources<br>to draw from in a university and in a<br>chair role which is in partnership with<br>seven different um public sector<br>agencies i am wanting to take heed of<br>the international and national<br>call for restorativists who are<br>naturally peacemakers to engage much<br>more deeply with their warrior spirit in<br>order to really challenge and transform<br>social and racial harms<br>a different set of questions are<br>probably going to need to drive our work<br>agenda<br>what can<br>what can a restorative lens offer by way<br>of tools to do this work of<br>decolonization<br>how can white practitioners develop<br>skills to identify historical and<br>systemic and system harm<br>how do we become conscious of our own<br>biases and more skillful at disrupting<br>the nuanced ways in which we reenact<br>them<br>what are the names and meanings of<br>existing of existing erie and harpoon<br>concepts for dispute resolution<br>mediation peacemaking and restorative<br>type work can restorative work alongside<br>takana maori in addressing harms can a<br>negotiated space model represented with<br>the dual hulls waka here in this<br>powerpoint be a useful frame for us who<br>would like to be part of this<br>conversation how can we in the chair<br>enable and support those courageous<br>conversations into actually happening<br>what is our role in driving a human<br>rights and capability building agenda in<br>aotearoa<br>so in conclusion a restorative agenda<br>that ignores in<br>inequities will be perceived as<br>uninformed uncaring irrelevant maybe<br>even racist<br>success for us will need to rest not<br>just on individual transformation or<br>singular great projects but on true<br>systems change<br>um so i'm going to leave it there and<br>just open the floor to discussion<br>i've finished right on half an hour so<br>um<br>there's a little bit of time for<br>wonderful thank you very much jane that<br>was excellent and<br>it was great to see it so<br>interwoven with the sdgs as a real<br>engagement with sdg 16.<br>now um we would like to open the floor<br>for questions but for practicality<br>reasons we've learned in the past that<br>it is best to do this through the chat<br>function<br>um and i'd like to start with a question<br>by<br>laurie magnus<br>who firstly says it's it's really good<br>to start with the sdgs as a way of<br>connecting all of this to<br>to human rights<br>um and other conventions that we're<br>signatory to and she follows up with a<br>question<br>um<br>about the commissions the royal<br>commissions<br>do they name the systemic discrimination<br>that has led to the to the type of abuse<br>and do they then also put processes in<br>place to stop it<br>what is your insight into this chain<br>can i check christian is that a question<br>about institutional um organizations<br>that have been called to account<br>i mean i believe so i mean it's in the<br>it's in the context of the royal<br>commissions um when they talk about<br>systemic discrimination discrimination<br>do they<br>identify it and do they put measures in<br>place i suppose it's<br>i suspect the question is about<br>identifying the underlying causes of<br>what happens rather than just dealing<br>with symptoms<br>yes okay so um<br>by no means am i an expert in royal<br>commissions um but<br>in general there um<br>there are you know there are large<br>panels of very expert and you know elite<br>kind of judges and magistrates sitting<br>in the royal in the role of royal<br>commissioner<br>um and their their job in hearing um<br>stories and um is to kind of do that<br>piece which is um<br>interro you know trying to look for<br>patterns in particular institutions um<br>in particular churches or faith-based<br>groups in particular sporting<br>organizations particular schools and<br>education systems they hear all of the<br>evidence and will be able to put it<br>together and in their in their final<br>reports do make recommendations that<br>look at the systemic issues in each of<br>those institutions<br>and the restorative part kind of comes<br>after that which is in the redress<br>package um and sits at a different level<br>yeah<br>um lori did i represent your question<br>appropriately<br>okay thank you i took me a minute to get<br>my head around it excellent thank you<br>and then a new question is coming from<br>lewis can restorative practices be used<br>in a transnational setting i'm thinking<br>along the lines of diplomacy strategies<br>with dispute resolution if so what can<br>new zealand or the aussies<br>do to be more effective in this space<br>very interesting<br>yeah very interesting question and yes<br>absolutely it can be done and it is done<br>and it's certainly probably more in the<br>european<br>um in some of the european um<br>in the european form forum we see some<br>of this um it tends to be<br>you know um trained negotiators and<br>peacemakers bringing in restorative as<br>another tool to their belt and and to<br>using that lens when they can in the<br>field and then in complex negotiations<br>uh defense were interestingly yeah um a<br>funder of the chair back in at the start<br>for this very reason that of course any<br>any time that there's conflict crime<br>harm happening restorative can be<br>brought in as a useful tool to kind of<br>um to attend to some of that<br>excellent thank you and um while the new<br>questions come in oh there's one<br>a question from<br>sasha with regards to the christchurch<br>mosque attacks in 2019 and its roadmap<br>to restorative justice for victims and<br>communities<br>what would be some of the indicators<br>that might be useful to monitor<br>how rhetoric restorative practice can be<br>achieved meaningfully for affected<br>communities and in new zealand's action<br>plan against racism agenda as a whole<br>sorry so i said restorative practice but<br>it was restorative justice<br>hopefully that question<br>comes across<br>well<br>yeah i mean that's a fabulous question<br>and it's certainly something we've been<br>thinking about in in the chair<br>um and you know restorative was<br>mentioned in the final report around<br>christ as being potentially a useful<br>mechanism<br>but rather than kind of yeah rather than<br>simply thinking of it as you know um<br>some of the survivors coming into<br>contact with the perpetrator which would<br>be kind of a simplistic understanding of<br>what restorative could offer exactly as<br>this question alludes to restorative<br>could be done in community to tackle the<br>um ripples of of harm that happened in<br>christchurch after the event which are<br>around racism and systematic yeah<br>systemic racism and you know how we<br>might do that work um of course is you<br>know it's like a million dollar question<br>um you want to be doing it in a way that<br>has kind of um<br>tikanga um islamic kind of uh way of<br>thinking about it and you'd be working<br>to kind of we would be wanting to work<br>in a co-design way in communities to<br>work out exactly what's needed and what<br>restorative could bring but yeah that<br>work around kind of unpacking racism can<br>be is done a lot in america off the back<br>of the black lives matter movement um<br>yeah so we could do it here too<br>excellent thank you and i suppose i also<br>have a<br>question to what extent does the chair<br>and related agencies actually<br>link what they do to the sdgs and<br>specifically to the to sdg 16 as a<br>roadmap and as a as an internationally<br>stood understood<br>language i<br>suppose christian<br>i'm sorry to say that probably not as<br>much as we should or we could and maybe<br>this but maybe this very presentation<br>will be the impetus for some change<br>there i think that one of the the tricky<br>things in restorative is that people<br>come to it from very vastly different<br>disciplines<br>um and you know in our team we have<br>nurses and social workers and<br>theologians and you know my background<br>in psychology and criminology um and so<br>um and not as many political scientists<br>and and philosophers who might bring<br>naturally that affinity to the human<br>rights lands but it does it is a<br>universal so i think we could do much<br>more so it's a good question<br>thank you<br>right well you do have a bit more time<br>oh i'll just jump in to<br>fill this space for a minute um how have<br>you found your shift over to to new<br>zealand<br>do you see distinctive differences<br>between the australian the new zealand<br>approach and if so you know how could<br>you how could you best explain that<br>difference or describe it<br>yep okay so um<br>yeah i mean the transition even though<br>it's just across the tasman it was quite<br>a significant for me um bringing a whole<br>family across and so a lot of kind of um<br>a lot of thought went into the decision<br>and really um it was around the fact<br>that even though new zealand and similar<br>and australia have so many similarities<br>and both<br>both i think both have both record kind<br>of a hot bed of experimentation and<br>restorative back in the 1990s<br>it is the case that new zealand is a<br>long way ahead partially because<br>legislation kind of supports a lot of<br>restorative happening but also be and<br>but also because it's a smaller country<br>there's more recognition that something<br>like restorative has value um you kind<br>of see a pipeline effect where people<br>because you have restorative in<br>say the pb4l program which is in primary<br>and high schools people coming through<br>that then they get to university and<br>there's something restorative at<br>university then they get to the<br>workplace and there's you know<br>restorative in the workplace and then if<br>you're unfortunately in contact with the<br>criminal justice system you're<br>definitely gonna get gonna see some<br>restorative and we you know it's also<br>used for very very challenging very<br>challenging crimes such as sexual<br>violence through project restore so for<br>me all of those levels of innovation and<br>willingness to kind of use restorative<br>made it very exciting and easy easy<br>decision to kind of move over<br>yeah<br>okay<br>um again you're very welcome to<br>add more questions into the chat box<br>um<br>okay a question from margaret how does<br>the covet 19 vaccine mandate for<br>employment in certain sectors in new<br>zealand relate to<br>justice in the united states a<br>sustainable goal<br>very interesting<br>do you feel that you can speak to this<br>jane or oh i think you should answer<br>that one christian<br>um<br>i'm<br>i'm not sure i mean this is such a<br>that's a<br>politically laden and ethically laid in<br>question that<br>i i'm not sure that even the the people<br>who head up the unsdgs<br>may not have a ready response to this<br>i mean i think this will be debated for<br>some time yet<br>but you know there are a couple of<br>couple of dynamics under sdg3<br>good health and well-being and then<br>there are other dynamics at play which<br>might be<br>pulling us in a different direction so<br>it is clearly a<br>topic i think that will be debated in<br>most countries beyond that i'm afraid i<br>can't add much<br>are there any other<br>questions that you you would like to<br>okay<br>all right<br>so another question from from lewis how<br>can someone best navigate conversations<br>with people who may claim that<br>restorative isn't valuable or useful<br>what techniques can be used to persuade<br>them of the value of restorative justice<br>yeah so that's a good question<br>um and of course there are many people<br>who<br>me many people who don't kind of have a<br>natural affinity to the ideas of<br>restorative or just think it sounds too<br>fluffy<br>um to kind of um wobbly as a concept to<br>have much utility um<br>and<br>i mean<br>yeah there are so many there are<br>different ways you can tackle it one is<br>that you can look at the existing<br>alternatives of which there are<br>basically none or very few depending on<br>what context you're talking about<br>you can point to what i do being a<br>social scientist i mean tend to point to<br>the evidence which is around how it<br>works and who's how you know how<br>effective it is even you know in terms<br>of reducing reoffending or you know<br>satisfaction from procedural justice<br>perspective so i'd tend to use the<br>evidence<br>um the other strategy that you can do is<br>to try and use the restorative questions<br>like what happened the impact and the<br>way forward you can try and insert that<br>into the conversation using<br>you know bringing something to mind and<br>kind of unpacking it i mean the best way<br>i mean often people come to it via doing<br>it and then go ah yeah it's really good<br>and we have lots of especially we do a<br>lot of work with government it might be<br>very skeptical and you take the<br>restorative model and you do it and<br>suddenly that you've got a bunch of<br>converts<br>so um you know yeah so<br>those are some of the strategies i<br>suppose that you can use i'm sure there<br>will be people here who are<br>practitioners who would have many many<br>wonderful and a final question from<br>laurie in the process of unpacking any<br>case of systemic discrimination<br>yeah i mean without knowing exactly what<br>the term allies means<br>as soon as you get any complexity to an<br>encounter like a harm or a just you know<br>a harm or a crime you yeah the<br>restorative circle can be<br>kind of um the restorative circle can be<br>enlarged can be bigger to bring in as<br>many people as you think necessary to<br>support a good conversation happening<br>and you would be bringing in specialists<br>um certainly in you know if you're<br>talking about something like sexual<br>violence or family violence you're<br>bringing in people who know those who<br>know that you know the attributes of<br>those kinds of harms and you're bringing<br>them in to support a safe um a safe and<br>useful conversation and the same thing<br>with um<br>same thing with systematic<br>discrimination that you know there are<br>some complexities there and patterns<br>that could be usefully unpacked by<br>experts so yeah you bring in as many<br>excellent thank you and a final question<br>i can truly find a question from<br>rosalind but thank you for that<br>additional question<br>um what is the effectiveness of<br>restorative processes in reducing<br>reoffending in the justice system so<br>what are what are some of the stats and<br>how do the victims respond<br>yeah so the reoffending metric is very<br>important to every government department<br>that i've ever met and globally it's a<br>metric that that matters and it matters<br>to communities too because you don't<br>want more crime<br>and you know some of the evidence is<br>mixed but a lot of it especially with<br>more serious crime and in the processing<br>space is very very it's very strong that<br>it does reduce free offending if there<br>have been some randomized control trials<br>that support um the fact that it has a<br>significant reduction in<br>leads to a significant reduction in<br>re-offending some of that literature<br>sits in um there's a web the campbell<br>collaboration which is a kind of a<br>site which collects kind of good quality<br>evidence and that's a good place to look<br>um if you're interested in that in terms<br>of how victims respond um victims<br>there's a very high you know in terms of<br>a justice mechanism very very high rates<br>of satisfaction because people are<br>having a say very high sense of<br>procedural justice because it's fair and<br>equitable<br>um in terms of whether it transforms<br>lives um you know it depends on the<br>severity of the impact and and and what<br>else is going on but certainly in terms<br>of general satisfaction satisfaction<br>yeah there's um it's very positive<br>wonderful thank you very much um<br>after this really interesting uh<br>presentation and then the discussion<br>um i'd like to now draw the seminar or<br>this webinar i should say to a clause<br>thank you very much jane that was really<br>really interesting and i think we we did<br>have quite a range of attendees with a<br>lot of backgrounds from both within<br>universities outside universities and<br>also<br>our other universities around new<br>zealand and<br>overseas<br>so not just victoria<br>so thank you very much your presentation<br>is much appreciated<br>and if i may i would now just briefly<br>like to share the<br>closing slide which is because this is a<br>speaker series our closing slide is<br>always an overview of<br>who we have already heard from<br>and now jane's took place today so<br>there's one more in december which is<br>the one by professor professor arthur<br>grimes<br>he is the chair and well-being and his<br>seminar is<br>a<br>postponed date because it was initially<br>affected by the covert lockdown<br>so he will speak on the 8th of december<br>between 5 40 and 6 30 again<br>and if you're interested in these topics<br>and how they the different topics relate<br>to the sdgs please sign up to our<br>mailing list so we can get in touch with<br>you in the future<br>all right thank you very much i<br>appreciate everybody joining us for this<br>webinar and again thank you to jane<br>and i hope you have a great evening</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
