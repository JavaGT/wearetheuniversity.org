Through the MCom you will be exposed to a diverse range of methods of data collection, analysis, and interpretation including surveys and focus groups, experimental research, critical theory and post-positivism, statistics, complexity and network science, design thinking, and indigenous methodologies. <br><br>You will receive a unique classroom experience with one-on-one mentoring and supervision by leading academics, small highly interactive classes, and frequent presentations. You will gain advanced professional skills in analysis, synthesis, and communication and become part of a community of students who have a profound and critical voice that is heard across all sectors of society. <br><br>www.wgtn.ac.nz/mcom</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>We put strong emphasis here at the Wellington <br>School of Business and Government on the fact  <br>that we want people with a natural curiosity <br>for something in their area of expertise. So,  <br>it's not that we're prescribing <br>topics in these degrees. This is  <br>where you should bring in something <br>that you that you deeply care about.<br>Kia ora, I'm Markus Luczak-Roesch. I'm <br>the Academic Programme Leader for the  <br>Master of Commerce and the Bachelor <br>of Commerce with Honours programmes.<br>The Master of Commerce and the honours degree <br>are designed for people who want to do a research  <br>postgraduate education, so these are a little <br>bit different from the professional programmes  <br>in the regard that they prepare <br>people with research skills,  <br>so these are the skills that you need <br>to design inquiry into open issues.<br>I decided to pursue a research-focused <br>programme just because  <br>I prefer writing a thesis because they <br>give you that flexibility and space where  <br>you can find a problem and you get to discover <br>a topic that you're super interested in.<br>I decided to pursue the Master of <br>Commerce because it's a way to sort of  <br>challenge myself. I'm sort of a naturally <br>curious person. I enjoyed studying before that  <br>but I wanted to pick my own path. Being able <br>to do research really allowed me to do that.<br>So my research topic, I looked at what <br>organisations can do to integrate and welcome  <br>former refugees into their workplace, inclusion <br>and diversity, and that's easier said than done.  <br>But, I was super interested in that topic because <br>there's a lot of research out there that looks  <br>at what the issues are that former refugees <br>have but not so much that focus on solutions.<br>I researched supply chain resilience for small <br>business exporters in New Zealand during Covid.  <br>Because New Zealand's economy relies so much on <br>small businesses I was really really interested  <br>in taking a look at how small businesses were <br>doing resilience-wise during the pandemic.  <br>It was a challenge but it was <br>also really really rewarding  <br>because it came at a time when I think <br>this kind of research was needed.<br>The highlight of my studies is when the university <br>organised a research showcase. That was pretty  <br>cool because they invited employers and other <br>academics to come have a look at you present  <br>a poster on your research and it <br>really comes to show you how a lot  <br>of people have research ideas that <br>are super relevant to the world.<br>Research is a skill that is more than ever <br>necessary in any career really. Policy makers  <br>do research every day and all day long so <br>it's part of their skill set, it has to be  <br>the appropriate training for research, so in <br>the policy space it's quite natural but also  <br>for companies doing market <br>research, research is important.<br>This degree is designed for someone who wants to <br>differentiate themselves straight at the start of  <br>their career. You usually transition into the <br>honours or the MCOM programmes straight out of  <br>your undergraduate because you do an additional <br>fourth year of study basically to specialise in  <br>your field and the differentiation is that you do <br>an individual research project that only you do.<br>So only one student works on a project with <br>a specific title. So choosing that wisely  <br>and working on something that really <br>matters outside of this building,  <br>outside in the world, in the business world, in <br>the governmental world, and also through society,  <br>makes difference because that is what people <br>can then put on their on their CV and that will  <br>differentiate them from someone else because <br>no one else will have that title in their CV.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
