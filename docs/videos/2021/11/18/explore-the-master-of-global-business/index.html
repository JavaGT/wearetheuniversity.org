This programme is best suited to recent graduates who are looking to kick-start their career in global business and strategy.   <br><br>www.wgtn.ac.nz/mgbus</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>The Master of Global Business is designed for <br>emerging professionals and high-performing  <br>recent graduates who are keen to develop a <br>global mindset to be applied to their careers.<br>So, we require students to have a Bachelor's <br>degree with a minimum B average but this can  <br>be from any discipline and in fact it <br>is our strength to have students from  <br>multiple and diverse backgrounds so <br>that they can all learn from each other.<br>My name is Dr Christian Yao. I'm the Academic <br>Programme Leader of the Master of Global Business.<br>Our courses are designed to be both theoretical <br>and practical which means that our lecturers  <br>will teach theoretical models as strategies <br>based on the reasons and latest research.<br>Students also have the opportunity <br>to develop rich knowledge  <br>and multiple perspectives on global <br>issues in the business context.<br>This gives students a competitive advantage in <br>this highly dynamic global business environment.<br>For some students this means that it gives <br>them a new value to their current professions  <br>where for others it means that it's <br>opened new opportunities to them as well.<br>Being a part of the graduates  <br>of the Master of Global Business also means <br>that students build strong connections and  <br>professional networks within their cohort and <br>they will also develop a long-time friendship.<br>I've learned how to collaborate, <br>communicate, and work in a diverse  <br>environment. It gives me that sense of belonging <br>to a culturally diverse group of students. <br>The class was quite small, there wasn't a lot of <br>people, so that enabled a lot of conversation and  <br>discussion during the classes and it just made <br>it a lot easier for that relationship building  <br>and networking, which is so important <br>when you're studying a Master's degree.<br>I chose to study the professional programme <br>here because of the sustainability practices  <br>that you put forth in all of the programmes. So <br>for me that was a big difference between the  <br>programmes at this university versus <br>other universities and other places.<br>Students will be able to learn academic <br>knowledge and multiple perspectives that's in  <br>the current global content. Students also have the <br>opportunities to apply those academic knowledge  <br>to the current global issues through group <br>projects and professional activities. <br>Well, the opportunity I've gained from <br>this programme in particular is how  <br>to apply the knowledge. So, I've managed <br>to participate in a project where we have  <br>global virtual teams. So we have themes from <br>different universities across the globe. We  <br>sign up for the X-culture and then we we actually <br>did a project on a selected company. So we use our  <br>skill to come up with ideas to solve an <br>issue. So this X-culture project is very  <br>interesting and it gives us the understanding <br>of how to work in the global virtual teams.<br>So the university is so close to businesses <br>and government that you can just get a lot  <br>of engagement with that and it's really easy to <br>go back and forth between university and work.<br>Our students come from very diverse <br>backgrounds. We have designers who enrol  <br>into this programme and want to add values <br>to their profession. We also have existing  <br>graduates or recent graduates who want to <br>refresh their global mindset and really explore  <br>the international content. So students can always <br>find some unique values to add to their careers.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
