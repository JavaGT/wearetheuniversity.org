Government departments, businesses, libraries, museums, and archives all need people who can identify relevant information, retrieve it, organise it, and make sure people can access it. <br><br>You’ll learn about information services, storage, and retrieval, while gaining skills in management and communication, information technology, and research methods. You’ll gain a thorough, technology-focused, and research-based education in information organisation, oriented to the needs of New Zealand information professionals and national aims to improve digital literacy and inclusion.   <br><br>The MIS is taught entirely online, giving you the flexibility to study from anywhere in New Zealand, and to balance study with your other commitments. <br><br>www.wgtn.ac.nz/mis</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>We organise information, we provide <br>access to information, and we help people  <br>find information. We can work across a variety <br>of disciplines, whether it's a corporate setting,  <br>in our traditional libraries, <br>archives, even in the museum sector,  <br>organising the physical and digital <br>content that an organisation has.<br>Kia ora koutou I'm Jennifer Campbell-Meier. I <br>am the information studies programme director.<br>The information studies Master's programme <br>is designed for people who are interested in  <br>working in one of the information professions <br>which includes libraries, archives, records  <br>organisations, as well as companies and other <br>organisations like museums and galleries that have  <br>either their own records that they keep or work <br>with the public and share and find information.<br>Well I decided to pursue a Master's in information <br>studies because I wanted a career change. I have  <br>a background in history and demography and also in <br>research and I sort of reached a bit of an impasse  <br>in my current career and I thought I wanted to try <br>to find something where I could use this knowledge  <br>and information that I've gained from my previous <br>jobs and this libraries and archives seemed a  <br>really good option, and I really liked the look <br>of the course, I thought it looked really good.<br>I decided to pursue the postgraduate information <br>studies programme because it was a natural  <br>progression on from my BA in history and <br>my Postgraduate Diploma in Museum Studies.  <br>I was working as an archivist at <br>Palmerston North City Libraries  <br>and it was a great way to upskill <br>and pursue lifelong learning.<br>We are a fully online programme. Some <br>of our courses are completely over 12  <br>weeks. You may have few tutorials that you <br>catch up with, usually around assessments.  <br>Other courses have regular meetings <br>like every third week and then  <br>the synchronous sessions meet <br>once a week for 12 weeks.<br>I have two goals. One was because I wanted to <br>develop my knowledge. I really enjoy studying  <br>and I'm interested in continuous improvement <br>so that has really satisfied it. And, secondly,  <br>was because of course I wanted to get into a <br>career in archives and records and therefore  <br>this was a really good way to do that.<br>The research project was one of the <br>big highlights of my study because  <br>that's meant I've been able to get out into <br>the institutions that I wanted to work in  <br>and do interviews with people there and actually <br>find out sort of exactly what was going on  <br>as part of my research project <br>and I've really enjoyed that.<br>It's a great first step if you are <br>starting out in your career for  <br>records or archives. It's going to prepare <br>you very well, not only with the theory  <br>and best practice in the sector at the <br>moment, but also with a lot of hands-on  <br>projects and reports and everything as <br>well so it's good in both regards to that.<br>The Master of Information Studies is <br>recognized by both RIMPA and LIANZA,  <br>our professional organisations and LIANZA members <br>can apply for registration once they graduate.<br>For career progression it's an <br>absolute necessity I think now.  <br>Lots of the job adverts in the field ask for <br>this particular qualification so definitely,  <br>if you want to progress in your <br>career, it's the way to go.<br>Masters of Information Studies <br>graduates work in libraries and  <br>archives but they also work in corporate <br>environments, so really any organisation  <br>where people have information to organise, <br>to access, or to share with a wider audience.<br>When we're looking at the wide variety <br>of organisations that we work within  <br>we are trying to come up with those <br>threshold skills that will help you  <br>manage your professional <br>career in information studies.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
