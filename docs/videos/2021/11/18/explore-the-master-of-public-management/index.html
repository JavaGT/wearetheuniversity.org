They'll learn about various <br>leadership styles and leadership techniques,  <br>not just for the public sector but also for the <br>not-for-profit and community sectors as well.<br>They'll learn about various aspects <br>of financial management and budgeting,  <br>a lot of emphasis on strategy <br>and strategic decision making,  <br>and of course all the things that they <br>need to learn about human resources.<br>The programme structure was really great. <br>The way it's delivered is in module forms,  <br>or certainly the papers that I did, which means <br>you come in for a day, you learn that module,  <br>and then you have a four to five week break <br>before you come back to learn the next module,  <br>and during that time you typically prepare <br>one of the deliverables for the paper.<br>So our Master of Public Management <br>graduates tend to move upwards and they  <br>move outwards. They're not necessarily <br>looking for a career change as such  <br>but they're certainly looking to move <br>into extended leadership positions,  <br>more senior positions within their agencies, <br>and of course we give them the transferable  <br>skills and knowledge that they can take to move <br>across agencies as well if they choose to do so.<br>Each year we do admit a few students that're <br>coming directly from a Bachelor's degree. These  <br>students have a passion for the public <br>sector, have a great academic record,  <br>and we welcome them into the same degree <br>programme as people with a bit more experience.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
