It includes a number of  <br>courses that focus on sort of business analysis, what is it, how do you do it, how do you  <br>model and represent processes, how do you manage <br>and analyze data, how do you manage projects. So  <br>they're the range, the sort of core skills of <br>the role as well as some high-level knowledge  <br>and skills around enterprise architecture, so how <br>do you look at an organisation and align their  <br>organisational goals, their structure, and their <br>information systems, and innovation and strategy.<br>My name is Michael Winikoff. I am the co-director <br>of the Master of Professional Business Analysis.<br>The aim of the degree is to provide an <br>opportunity for students who have studied  <br>another discipline other than information <br>technology and business analysis to come in and  <br>effectively change the direction of their career. <br>So what we're looking for with incoming students  <br>is a university degree in a different area, <br>we actually specifically don't normally  <br>accept students who have previously studied <br>information systems, and reasonable grades.<br>Work experience of some sort is positive <br>but it's not actually a formal requirement. <br>The reason I pursued this business <br>analysis programme is that I think it's  <br>related to my previous working experience. <br>I worked as a financial investment analyst  <br>for around 10 years and the main <br>job is to use the quantitative and  <br>qualitative evidence to make the investment <br>decision. And one of the things I was interested  <br>in is the quantitative part. So I really want <br>to learn more about how to use data to make a  <br>better decision in a broader business <br>world not only in the financial sector<br>The Master of Professional Business Analysis is <br>taught in dual mode so it's possible to do it  <br>face-to-face here in wellington. It's <br>also possible to do it entirely online.<br>During Covid and all the lockdowns I <br>was made redundant and I thought, okay,  <br>perhaps this is something I could <br>look at now that they offer it from  <br>Auckland and also online. My experience studying <br>online was actually really positive. Because I'm  <br>a parent I have to consider something that works <br>around my children's needs as well and although  <br>remote learning was sort of challenging <br>it was also really beneficial.<br>The teaching and learning methods themselves vary <br>from course to course. Some of the courses might  <br>have a sort of live lecture, perhaps in the morning <br>or early afternoon followed by a little bit later  <br>on a sort of tutorial interactive session. Other <br>courses might use more pre-recorded videos where  <br>you can watch them at any time and then there's <br>sort of a session where you can come in and  <br>ask questions of the academic staff and <br>also discuss and work with other students.<br>Some of the highlights have been just <br>re-engaging my brain again. It's been  <br>a little while since I have studied and also <br>just connecting with some young smart people  <br>and having some great conversations and great <br>learning. Learning just probably as much from them  <br>through collaboration as with the lecturers.<br>So the programme has been a <br>way for me to upskill and  <br>get back into the IT industry. It's changed a lot <br>since I worked there so it was a matter of just  <br>providing me with the tools and techniques that <br>are sort of currently being used in the industry.<br>I think after this programme you have <br>multiple choices for the career progress.  <br>If you like communication you can be a business <br>analyst or a consultant. If you prefer the  <br>technical work you can choose to be ICT staff.<br>Then the other thing which is a really important <br>and valuable aspect of this degree is industry  <br>involvement and that comes in two main forms. <br>One of them is at the end of the degree.  <br>The capstone is a project, so students go <br>out into industry to real organisations  <br>in groups and do a project, and the other <br>aspect is along the whole degree there's  <br>Friday sessions where industry <br>people come in, practitioners,  <br>and students have an opportunity to interact with <br>them, to ask questions, to build their networks.<br>We also run a mentoring programme so that's one <br>of the things that sets this degree apart. So  <br>it has strong academic skill-based content <br>but also strong industry engagement.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
