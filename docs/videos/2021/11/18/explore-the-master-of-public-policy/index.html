Gain the expertise that policymakers need to create strategic and operational policies to make life better—locally, nationally, and internationally. <br><br>Our MPP provides an excellent avenue for professionals in the public and non-governmental sectors to acquire a nuanced understanding of policy design, analysis, and implementation in the real world. You will develop practical problem-solving skills and learn techniques that draw on concepts from several disciplines. Our association with key players in government means that you will learn from policymakers and advisers involved in strategic and operational decision-making. <br><br>www.wgtn.ac.nz/mpp</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>The programmes in public policy and public <br>management are designed primarily for people  <br>who are already working in the public sector at <br>local, national, or even international levels.  <br>They have had some experience but they're looking <br>to deepen and consolidate what they can do and  <br>learn more contemporary up-to-date <br>knowledge and skills for their careers.<br>I'm Amanda Wolf and I'm the Academic Programme  <br>Leader for the Master of Public Policy <br>and Master of Public Management degrees.<br>As my background was in tourism development as an  <br>advisor I was looking for new opportunities <br>to broaden my chances, or opportunities for  <br>professional development, and public <br>policy seemed to be a good fit, and the  <br>certificate course gave me the opportunity to do <br>an intensive period of study to refocus my career. <br>The main reason I wanted to go for public <br>policy is because I recognised that  <br>this was the best way to enter public service or <br>any service where you want to work with people.<br>In the public policy degree we primarily focus on <br>improving the design of innovative and effective  <br>public policies that meet the needs of people <br>now and into the future, taking into account  <br>the vast complexities of the world and using <br>a broad range of evidence to do that advising.<br>I now know that if I was in an interview <br>with World Bank, with an INGO, I know exactly  <br>the kind of conversations I could have, <br>the kind of problems I want to talk about,  <br>and it's really made me take <br>a lens at my own country  <br>and think, okay, now that I have this Master Public <br>Policy what do I do more than what I did before?<br>I think I've learned that I had strengths that <br>I didn't realise I had, so that a lot of my  <br>work experience in different countries <br>I was actually able to really  <br>pull together some of that and feed it into my <br>assignments and get appraisals, but also learnt  <br>a lot of new skills in terms of thinking about <br>different roles in the public sector but also  <br>skills in quantitative analysis that <br>I didn't realise that I could develop.<br>It gave me a lot of confidence in terms of facing <br>what would seem to be quite a daunting job market.<br>My current role as a researcher I really felt <br>that some of the work I did in the courses  <br>was really aligned with what this particular role <br>required and I was able to play to my strengths in  <br>the application and in the interview process but <br>also in the work situation on a day-to-day basis.<br>Each year we do admit a few students that're <br>coming directly from a Bachelor's degree.  <br>These students have a passion for the <br>public sector, have a great academic record,  <br>and we welcome them into the same degree <br>programme as people with a bit more experience.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
