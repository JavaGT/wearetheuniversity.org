Herenga Waka—Victoria  <br>University of Wellington it's a huge pleasure for <br>me to introduce today's speaker who is Dr Dougal  <br>Sutherland he's a registered clinical psychologist <br>and has been working with young people children  <br>and adults for many many years and has a lot of <br>expertise not only working with them but also  <br>teaching our next generation of clinical <br>psychologists much needed as you follow the news  <br>in this country to become clinical psychologists <br>so that's really important work there as well you  <br>might know Dougal from tv from the radio we might <br>have read something that he wrote he basically  <br>guided us through this pandemic and still does <br>explaining our emotions explaining how people  <br>react to all these different changes that happen <br>on a really daily basis and today he's going to  <br>talk about what you need to know about anxiety <br>in children and I guess we are not talking about  <br>Halloween scare are we okay as usually Dougal <br>is gonna share his talk with us first and then  <br>please keep writing your questions into the q a <br>box and we will bring them up later and discuss  <br>them towards the end please you can just type <br>them into the box and I'll bring them up later  <br>looking forward to hear now more about anxiety <br>and children develop oh well thanks Hedwig and  <br>tēnā koutou katoa everybody thank you for joining <br>us I appreciate that it is 5 p.m on Wednesday and  <br>if you're joining you are extra special because <br>yeah it's a big ask us you know because it's easy  <br>not to do something at five o'clock on Zoom on a <br>Wednesday night so appreciate you joining and hope  <br>you get something out of this let me tell you a <br>little bit about me or a little bit more Hedwig's  <br>already told you a little bit and then I'll share <br>some slides with you and we can talk and go from  <br>there so yeah I'm a clinical psychologist I'm <br>originally my whakapapa back is to Dunedin  <br>I was born and bred there as my <br>name might be a bit of a giveaway  <br>my genealogy goes back to Scotland on <br>both sides of my family pretty rapidly  <br>so yeah we're good Scots Presbyterians we grew <br>up I grew up in Dunedin did all my studies down  <br>there and started working there and then <br>moved up to Wellington around 20 years ago  <br>I worked in DHBs for about 15 years and then for <br>the last six or seven years I've been here at  <br>Victoria uni where I teach in the clinical psych <br>training program which involves a clinic as well  <br>where we see members of the public and I also do <br>some work on the side for an organization called  <br>Umbrella Wellbeing and we do mental health and <br>resilience training and workplaces so yeah so  <br>that's a little bit about me and I'm going to <br>share my slides now so that we can get into it so  <br>hold on one second while I click the right buttons <br>and you should be able to see those cool so I've  <br>bravely titled this everything you need to know <br>about child anxiety and and you'll see two names  <br>on there obviously mine but also Professor Karen <br>Salmon so Karen as a professor of child clinical  <br>psychology here at Victoria and essentially these <br>this is her information and so you could think  <br>about it that Karen's the brains and I'm the mouth <br>and so yeah so really want to acknowledge Karen  <br>I also want to acknowledge that whilst I've <br>titled it to everything you need to know it's  <br>probably not everything you need to know about <br>child anxiety it is some things yeah as Hedwig  <br>said if you've got questions as we go along just <br>throw them into the chat function I'm going to  <br>try and stop speaking with about 15 minutes to go <br>so that we can answer any questions you may have  <br>of course if you don't have any questions we can <br>just finish early and you can go and have dinner  <br>so either way we'll win okay let's start with a <br>bit of a Whakataukī poipoia to kākano kia puāwai<br>so nurture the seed and it will bloom so this <br>really to me summons up that whole idea of we  <br>need to be nurturing our kids and anxiety is one <br>of those things that really if you've known any  <br>kids with anxiety or you've been anxious yourself <br>you know the battering effect anxiety can have  <br>on your wellbeing and hopefully by working with <br>kids helping kids when they're anxious we'll help  <br>nurture them so that in later life well even in <br>the next in the very near future they will bloom  <br>this is just an outline of what I'm going to <br>talk about today I'm going to talk about what  <br>is anxiety how common is it which is and how <br>it's been affected by COVID which is you know  <br>there are often lots of questions around that what <br>causes it and and here's a spoiler there's lots  <br>of things there's not one thing in particular if <br>only there was it would be real easy and what can  <br>we do about it how do we help kids when they're <br>anxious so that's the sort of overview for today  <br>firstly I thought it'd be good to <br>just talk about give you some examples  <br>let's make this real by the way these <br>aren't real examples these are based on  <br>mashups of people I have known whose names have <br>been changed to protect the innocent essentially<br>three examples there James Toni and Emma Emma nine <br>years old is possibly what you might think of as  <br>classically anxious she worries about everything <br>she gets a sore tummy when she's anxious  <br>she's clingy to her parents and she doesn't really <br>want to go anywhere without them that might be  <br>what we often might think <br>of as somebody who's anxious  <br>however anxiety looks different for different <br>ages and different stages and different  <br>vendors in different people James 11 non-compliant <br>and aggressive at home refuses to go to school  <br>and worst of all won't get out of the car to <br>come in and see the psychologist in the clinic  <br>so you can imagine that would be difficult on <br>the surface of it James's behavior looked like  <br>some sort of behavior problems or something like <br>that but actually underneath it that's probably  <br>anxiety he refuses to attend school because he's <br>too worried he gets aggressive because people are  <br>trying to force him to do things that he doesn't <br>want to do including go and see a psychologist  <br>and then lastly as an example example Toni 14 <br>she's what you might call a perfectionist she's  <br>good at everything skilled in maths and science <br>she's a high achiever but she doesn't get into  <br>competitive situations and she often has I've put <br>somatic complaints now that's a that's a fancy  <br>word it just means basically there's some stuff <br>that goes on in her body headaches stomachaches  <br>her skin gets a bit gets a bit of a rash when she <br>gets anxious so those are some typical examples  <br>of kids young people Toni wouldn't like to be <br>called a kid who experience anxiety and kind  <br>of what it looks like from the outside so let's <br>talk a little bit about more about what is anxiety  <br>firstly we've got to start from the position <br>that anxiety is actually a natural normal  <br>healthy emotion it's designed to keep us safe <br>that's the protective function all of us will  <br>experience anxiety in our lifetime or feelings of <br>anxiousness perhaps you want to say it like that  <br>because really that's our brain our final flight <br>system being activated and saying hey there's  <br>something out here that you think is dangerous and <br>be alert be on guard because this thing could be  <br>dangerous if you think about it developmentally <br>as humans this evolved out of the times when we  <br>were worried about being eaten or beaten eaten <br>by a saber-toothed tiger or beaten up by that  <br>terrible that terrible group that lived over <br>there that we were at war with and anxiety is  <br>designed to protect us however it can go a bit <br>wrong sometimes sometimes it gets a bit severe  <br>chronicity means it keeps going for a long time <br>it feels uncontrollable and it starts to have  <br>an impact on your life those examples that <br>we saw before of the kids James 11 year old  <br>didn't want to go to school anxiety was having <br>an impact on his life so think about it as a  <br>continuum at one end normal levels of anxiety <br>and situations where anybody would feel anxious  <br>but then it starts to come through where it's <br>more unpredictable more uncontrollable more  <br>severe more ongoing and that's when you might <br>start to get into what we call anxiety disorders  <br>and now there are two key components to any <br>anxiety disorder firstly there's the panic  <br>panic is a physical experience it's an emotional <br>experience if you've ever had a panic attack and  <br>I had panic attacks when I was at university the <br>panic is a good way to summon them up this is like  <br>this feeling of complete terror of what is going <br>on for me and there's often well there's almost  <br>always a physical component your heart beats <br>really fast you get sweaty and shaky you can't  <br>sleep you can't sit still the other main component <br>that we often find in anxiety is worry and that's  <br>a mental process so worry is about you worry too <br>much about things that are unlikely to happen  <br>so your mind goes to thinking about what if what <br>if that could happen and usually it's associated  <br>with the worst case scenario what if this happened <br>what if oh my god what if the university fell down  <br>I would die and it would be terrible for kids <br>when we're working with kids who are anxious  <br>we often use this metaphor of a fire alarm like <br>a fire alarm is a really useful thing to have  <br>when it rings when there's a fire so <br>that would be when you have a normal  <br>level of anxiety right it goes off when you're <br>something that you really should be afraid of  <br>but often when we're dealing with anxious kids in <br>clinical situations their fire alarm is giving off  <br>false alarms so it's going off too much too often <br>and giving you a false alarm so when we work with  <br>kids who are anxious we often say hey look this is <br>not about you never feeling anxious again ever in  <br>your life it's about tweaking your fire alarm <br>system so that it only goes off when there's  <br>something really to be worried about rather than <br>going off every day about every little thing  <br>but that's an overview about what anxiety <br>is some of the core components of it and  <br>let's talk about the different types of anxiety <br>that we might see in children and young people<br>so I've got a list here and I'll go through <br>there's about half a dozen and I just want  <br>to give a note of explanation on each <br>firstly separation anxiety disorder  <br>now separation anxiety disorder is when you get <br>and this is typically younger children around  <br>sort of late preschool going into early primary <br>school age when they won't they won't separate  <br>from their parents without some level of distress <br>now again many of you if your parents will know  <br>that this is not an unusual thing right you've <br>had you've taken your child to daycare and  <br>you've kind of had to peel them off you and hand <br>them over to the daycare teacher and then run a  <br>run quick get out before they before they come <br>so that's not unusual in itself but it's when  <br>children's this becomes a real problem and <br>particularly when kids start hitting school  <br>they need to be able to leave you right they spend <br>six hours a day at school so separation anxiety  <br>becomes a disorder when it really impacts on your <br>life and kids can't leave school without you or as  <br>soon as you leave school or when you try to leave <br>school they have a massive temper tantrum or they  <br>break down in tears often what's behind separation <br>anxiety disorder when you dig in is kids are  <br>worried that something bad is going to happen to <br>them or to their parents so they worry that the  <br>reason mum is late is because she's had a horrible <br>car accident and died or they're worried that  <br>if they go out and stay at a friend's house <br>there might be an earthquake in the house  <br>will collapse and they'll get hurt so that's <br>the essence of separation anxiety disorder is  <br>a fear that something bad is going to happen <br>to you or to the people around you that you  <br>love and so you don't want to separate from them <br>makes sense in some ways right selective mutism  <br>now this is this really anxious yes it is but it <br>doesn't display it like that so selective mutism  <br>is when you get a child or a young person who will <br>not be able to speak in a certain situation often  <br>that would be at school but not exclusively so <br>this might be a child who's pretty quiet anyway  <br>who will talk away okay at home but when <br>they get to school they completely clam up  <br>and won't say a thing usually it's because <br>they're anxious and not all not always but  <br>if it's an anxiety disorder it's because they're <br>anxious about something about being evaluated in  <br>that social setting so they might talk and what <br>so the selective part is that they don't talk  <br>in one or more settings but they do talk <br>in other places but typically at home<br>let's see we've jumped too but that's okay <br>specific phobia these are classic people know  <br>about phobias right I'm afraid of spiders and I've <br>got to say this is everybody says oh I'm afraid  <br>of spiders I'm afraid of heights this is more <br>than being just a little bit afraid when you're  <br>seeing a spider and go oh that's terrible this is <br>incapacitating fear this is a fear where I can't  <br>go into a room if I even think there's a spider in <br>there I can't I have a specific phobia of heights  <br>it means I cannot go up three floors because <br>I'm so worried though there's a difference  <br>here between what we most of us experience is <br>about of oh I'm a bit funny on heights or a bit  <br>yucky with spiders too this is a real dread <br>and fear of them another type of phobia but  <br>we put it in a different group of social anxiety <br>social phobia social anxiety same thing that's  <br>where you have a real worry about how others are <br>going to perceive you and evaluate you in public  <br>and it can get to the point where you don't <br>go out in public because you're so worried  <br>that you are going to be negatively <br>evaluated so people are going to think  <br>nasty things about you say <br>horrible things about you  <br>panic disorder is when you might experience <br>panic attacks and that develops into a fear  <br>of when you're going to have these and and <br>these are typically starting to develop in later  <br>childhood or teenage years and then generalized <br>anxiety disorder is kind of when you worry about  <br>everything all the time little things all the <br>time what's going to happen about that what  <br>if that what if that what if that you know <br>what happens if we don't make it there what  <br>happens if this happens what happens if that <br>and there's lots of what-ifs and your mind's  <br>pre-occupied with these worries and then lastly <br>agoraphobia now commonly people often think about  <br>if you say to somebody what's agoraphobia <br>they go is that the fear of being outdoors  <br>it's not really the fear of being outdoors what it <br>is it's a fear that you're going to be somewhere  <br>in a public place hence the outdoors but and <br>what's going to happen is that you're going to do  <br>something get into an embarrassing uncomfortable <br>horrible situation and you won't be able to escape  <br>or get help and typically people with agoraphobia <br>are worried they're going to have a panic attack  <br>like at the movies and they won't be able to <br>get help and something terrible will happen  <br>and so you stop going out you can see there's <br>a bit of a cross over there with social anxiety  <br>both of those have the overlap where you don't <br>go out or you perhaps you stop going out or limit  <br>where you're going out to now some of these <br>problems separation anxiety selective mutism  <br>tend to go away they tend to get less of those as <br>kids grow up some of them phobias social anxiety  <br>panic disorder can continue on and into adulthood <br>and many adults will relate to some of those<br>now it's useful to think about what's going on <br>in somebody's head people's always you know when  <br>you're a psychologist people are always asking <br>what's going on in their head what's going on  <br>inside well these are some of the thoughts <br>that are types of thoughts that are going on  <br>when people are anxious so separation anxiety <br>disorder the thought might be the thing that's  <br>going on in their head is mum might get <br>hurt in a car accident won't come back  <br>social phobia oh my god I'm going to do something <br>and everybody will laugh at me generalized anxiety  <br>disorder I'll fail the test but for generalized <br>anxiety you'd also be worrying about what will  <br>happen on the way home and then what's going <br>to happen when you do get home and will I get  <br>to sleep tonight and what happens if I develop a <br>really severe illness as well as failing the test  <br>and agoraphobia I'll feel sick or <br>faint and I won't be able to escape  <br>now I'm sure many of you who are watching will <br>kind of go well I kind of think that anyway  <br>sometimes and I think that's absolutely true and <br>that I think shows the normality of anxiety that  <br>many of us will think these or worry about <br>these sorts of things at some time in our life  <br>but when you are sort of preoccupied with being <br>worried about them that's when we would say it's  <br>starting to turn into something more than usual <br>now as you can imagine trying to explain some  <br>of these concepts to a child or a young person <br>can be a little bit difficult because it's a  <br>bit technical and we've been using kind of adult <br>language so often we use try and use social media  <br>or or some sort of things that kids from relate to <br>so I've got I've got a little bit of a clip here  <br>that I think nicely demonstrates worry <br>catastrophic thinking catastrophic thinking is  <br>I think there's going to be a catastrophe <br>the worst thing is going to happen and and  <br>so sometimes we show this particularly to young <br>people as an example so I'm going to click on this  <br>it's not too long it's like a minute <br>and a half just as a nice example about  <br>what you might imagine if <br>you're thinking catastrophically<br>Dr Pepper what's the worst that could <br>happen Johnson Todd Hohnson come in<br>now what seems to be the problem <br>well I hurt my little friend  <br>all right well take it out of your pants Todd oh <br>my gosh it's swollen I got it stuck in a keyhole  <br>looks like you need a band-aid but I <br>don't think I have one small enough well  <br>thanks anyway Nurse Chapman he should be <br>more careful where he sticks that thing<br>so that's a nice example of what's the worst <br>that could happen well if you have anxiety  <br>you've probably imagined all those scenarios <br>and even more but often we use kind of video  <br>clips when we're working with kids just to help <br>them help them understand because it's really  <br>crucial for people to understand what's going on <br>for them if they're going to do anything about it  <br>all right how common is it how common is <br>anxiety it's pretty high it's one of the  <br>and you can see if you think back to a couple of <br>slides ago there's actually when we talk about  <br>anxiety we're actually talking about a group or <br>a family of problems we're not just talking about  <br>one thing social phobia generalized anxiety panic <br>disorder selective mutism all those things so you  <br>can you can see that that's quite a big group <br>of problems there there is as you can see on the  <br>slide there there's a huge range in research as <br>some people would say you know 2 percent of people  <br>are anxious others say 41 percent of people are <br>anxious we often lump anxiety and depression and  <br>together when we're talking about prevalence <br>rates and we say do you know what about 1 in  <br>5people will experience anxiety or depression <br>in their lifetime so it is pretty common  <br>sometimes children simply don't come to attention <br>because they don't tell anybody or because parents  <br>don't know they don't really know what's going <br>on with their child if you think back to one of  <br>those first slides we talked about James 11 angry <br>aggressive defiant not going to school not getting  <br>out of the car to see the psychologist good lord <br>you know parents might not see that as anxiety  <br>and so you wouldn't go to a psychologist because <br>all you think you're dealing with is a naughty boy  <br>I've put there too on that slide there's been some <br>increase in the last 10 years in rates of anxiety  <br>that have been reported amongst children and I <br>put that in because that's a question that we  <br>often get asked has anxiety increased in the last <br>10 years is it to do with social media what about  <br>the internet that must be making people worse <br>there has been some increase in reports of anxiety  <br>maybe that's because we know more about anxiety <br>and people are much more willing to talk about it  <br>but I think that the increase also feels more <br>because there's been the increased awareness  <br>about it you know you've had great publicity <br>campaigns from people like John Kirwan and  <br>talking about the importance of you know mental <br>health depression and anxiety and so people are  <br>becoming more aware of it and sometimes I think <br>that has acted to magnify how big the increase in  <br>anxiety really is but we know it's pretty common <br>anyway if you don't know somebody with anxiety  <br>I suggest looking again because you probably <br>do they probably just haven't told you  <br>I also wanted to talk briefly about COVID what's <br>the impact of COVID again a really common question  <br>in this day and age is COVID making our kids <br>worse are they more anxious there was a UNICEF  <br>report released just in September so just really <br>recently who said look and in that report it said  <br>we're really worried about the impact of COVID <br>on children's mental health not so much from the  <br>direct impact of COVID but more likely through <br>things like having reduced access to education  <br>less contact with friends the economic effects <br>of COVID brings about poverty to families  <br>and there was an estimate that there might be <br>as much as a doubling of levels of anxiety and  <br>depression amongst children post-COVID compared <br>to pre-COVID now of course we're right in the  <br>middle of it so we can't know for sure we <br>can't know for sure whether this will last  <br>or whether it's just going to be a little bit of <br>a spike and then after we've got rid of COVID who  <br>who knows how that long that will be or when <br>we settle down with it at least those levels of  <br>anxiety might reduce down we don't know so we're <br>sort of in the middle of it and we'll have to wait  <br>and see I would note though you see that last <br>point there general triggering impact of major  <br>events what we notice clinically is that whenever <br>there is a big major event eg the 9/11 bombings or  <br>if there's been a highly publicized murder in an <br>area we often find that that is a trigger towards  <br>children presenting to the clinically with anxiety <br>and I think the same thing is that we have seen  <br>with COVID is that COVID might have been the <br>trigger that's led to somebody say to lead to a  <br>worsening of somebody's anxiety that was perhaps <br>always or had been there underneath for awhile  <br>and that the major event had actually triggered <br>it off so I can remember when I first arrived  <br>in Wellington I worked in Lower Hutt and there had <br>been a high profile murder on the riverbank and we  <br>had lots of kids that were coming in worried they <br>weren't worried about you know about the crime  <br>itself but they that seemed like the crime had had <br>had triggered something off for them so we do just  <br>see this general impact of major world events and <br>maybe that's what we're getting with COVID as well  <br>all right what else goes with cut with <br>anxiety so you see right in the middle  <br>there we've see up to 80 percent of kids who <br>have anxiety also have something else going on  <br>so you'll see a couple of common <br>things there we've got ADHD  <br>so 3 times more likely to have ADHD <br>and anxiety so those two to go together  <br>if you've got one anxiety disorder you often have <br>another one which is a bit of a bummer isn't it  <br>yeah you know you think one would be enough but no <br>you you're more likely to have another one as well  <br>in the bottom left corner conduct problems <br>so conduct problems are when kids are  <br>I'm going to use the colloquial term badly behaved <br>but I'm not talking about just being a bit naughty  <br>conduct problems are really severe behaviour <br>problems you know vandalism breaking things  <br>breaking laws hurting animals really getting <br>offside with the law as as a child or a young  <br>person that's a conduct problem and it's <br>more than just being badly behaved again  <br>3 times more likely with anxiety so these things <br>often go together and depression wow look at that  <br>6 to 12 times more likely that those two will <br>go together so we and we often talk you often  <br>hear talk people talking about anxiety and <br>depression in the same in the same sentence  <br>oh I suffer from anxiety and depression and <br>that's because they often do go together  <br>they're kind of different and they're <br>perhaps they're not different but  <br>we're focusing mainly on anxiety so yeah <br>lots of other things will go with it as well<br>all right what causes anxiety you <br>notice I've put causes in quotes  <br>because it's probably not a useful way to <br>think about mental health causing something  <br>causing something else is a bit more of biological <br>approach to things like COVID's a classic example  <br>if I get the coronavirus I will get COVID that's <br>a cause and effect for psychology it's never that  <br>simple there's never or hardly ever should I <br>say just one thing there's lots of things that  <br>contribute to why a person a child or a young <br>person might feel anxious and so we're going  <br>to talk about each of these as we go through I'm <br>only going to spend a couple of minutes on each  <br>so let's have a look genetics that kind of <br>sucks because there isn't anything you can  <br>do about your genes is it but if your parents <br>were anxious then it's a bit more likely probably  <br>about a third more likely that you will be anxious <br>compared to somebody whose parents weren't anxious  <br>now I can testify to that I as a child <br>as a young person I suffered from anxiety  <br>I didn't know it was anxiety at the time and then <br>when I went to university I had some panic attacks  <br>so I suffered from anxiety and lo and behold <br>my daughter I forgot to say I've got two kids  <br>myself I'm I have well the last time I counted <br>I had two dogs two children and one wife and  <br>the dogs are okay I don't think they're <br>anxious well actually one of them does  <br>seem a wee bit anxious but that's another talk but <br>my daughter she's 15 now but when she was 12 11  <br>she went through her own period of anxiety just <br>getting really wound up sort of panicky type  <br>symptoms could I take some of the I won't say the <br>blame because it's not a blame thing could I take  <br>do I acknowledge that there was a genetic <br>factor probably passed down from me and not  <br>and not her mum yes that probably came from me <br>so that kind of but there ain't much you can  <br>do about your genes it's just like your hair <br>color or eye color it's what you're born with  <br>it is more likely to occur in women than in <br>males there's a question there about is it  <br>just reported more is it more socially acceptable <br>for women to say that they're anxious than it is  <br>for men so but anyway we know let's say it's more <br>reported for women than men the other thing and  <br>these are sort of things that exist from a <br>very young age temperament temperament is a way  <br>a way that you interact with the world that you're <br>often born with and parents will know this so  <br>there's a particular type of temperament that's <br>called behavioral inhibition and this is when  <br>kids who are behaviorally inhibited as infants and <br>as toddlers they don't explore the world very much  <br>they seem to be a bit withdrawn and they seem <br>to be a bit clingy you might even refer them as  <br>and that's a risk factor for anxiety particularly <br>social anxiety and you can see there the mixture  <br>between temperament and genetics because kids <br>who have who are behaviorally inhibited who  <br>are clingy as young kids are more likely <br>to have parents who are anxious as well  <br>so there's a kind of an interaction but also <br>importantly most kids who who are a bit clingy  <br>as young as infants and as toddlers don't go <br>on to develop anxiety so it's not one of those  <br>things you can't just point your finger at one <br>thing and say ah that's what causes it there's  <br>lots of different things what else well negative <br>experiences and this is a particularly for phobias  <br>if you've had a bad experience as a <br>child with a dog being attacked by a dog  <br>lo and behold you might you might develop a <br>phobia for dogs and that's not uncommon at all  <br>what else worried thinking we know <br>that there are particular ways of  <br>thinking about the world styles of thinking <br>that tend to be associated with anxiety threat  <br>interpretations that's when your brain actively <br>looks around for things that might threaten you  <br>negative attributional style that's <br>just a a clinical way of saying  <br>you make you attribute bad things to you oh <br>my gosh this must happen because of me so your  <br>thinking is skewed from a young age towards <br>looking for threat and looking for bad things  <br>and lastly another factor that's involved with <br>anxiety is you learn from others hence the the  <br>mini-me slide beside it so if people around you <br>act in an anxious way then you're more likely to  <br>act in an anxious way as you grow up now it's <br>not that people around you are deliberately  <br>trying to teach you how to be anxious but we <br>all pick up from other people what goes on  <br>so again those are some of the things that <br>contribute to anxiety we also know that parents  <br>play a role and I want to be really clear about <br>this that this is not a way of blaming parents  <br>or saying to parents you have caused your child <br>to be anxious because I've never met a parent  <br>and I've met hundreds of parents I've never met a <br>parent who's gone out to make their child anxious  <br>but do you know what the way we act as parents <br>lo and behold has an impact on our children  <br>so if you are anxious as a parent and remember <br>genetically there's a stronger chance that you are  <br>your kids might pick up on that not that you want <br>them to there might be you might be inadvertently  <br>we could put here inadvertently reinforcing what <br>does that mean what it means is that you might  <br>reinforce not reward them but when they <br>seek comfort from you or when they seek  <br>to get out of a situation that they find <br>anxious you might help them to do that  <br>rather than helping them to stay in a situation <br>where they're feeling anxious and we know that  <br>staying in a situation when they feel anxious <br>probably in the long term is good because it helps  <br>you helps you reduce your anxiety but parents who <br>are anxious might be quicker to save their kids if  <br>you like from an anxiety provoking situation and <br>so kids as a result have fewer opportunities to  <br>learn that it's going to be okay so classically <br>what happens when you're anxious is that you  <br>want to get out of the situation away from the <br>situation that makes you anxious and when you do  <br>that you experience an immediate reduction in your <br>anxiety oh I feel better now because I got away  <br>great so what are you going to do next time try <br>to get away and what might your parents do try  <br>to help you get away because they can see that <br>you're distressed and upset so when we work with  <br>kids who are anxious we do spend a little bit <br>of time working with parents as well and saying  <br>to parents hey have you thought about doing <br>it a different way and I'll come to that soon  <br>all right how to help what are we going to <br>do so this looks like a slightly complicated  <br>diagram but I think you'll get it what we've <br>done here is the in the orange boxes or the  <br>things we've already talked about the things <br>that contribute to anxiety and the blue boxes  <br>over the top of the orange ones are how we can <br>help what do we do to help kids who are anxious  <br>in each of those different areas so I'll take <br>you through each of those different areas  <br>firstly we know that it's quite possible <br>to help the majority of people with anxiety  <br>and a particularly helpful type of therapy <br>is called cognitive behavior therapy  <br>cognitive is just really how you think <br>about the world and behavior is what you do  <br>so cognitive behavior therapy CBT many people have <br>heard of CBT there's a really awesome program for  <br>treating anxious kids called the cool kids <br>program it's an Australian program and it's  <br>been really thoroughly researched we run a cool <br>kids program here every year for anxious kids  <br>and it has really great results at its <br>heart CBT for anxiety is around helping  <br>young people children to get into situations that <br>they're afraid of or that they're avoiding and  <br>help them to learn or to discover that actually <br>they're going to be okay that the thing that they  <br>fear is probably not going to happen it uses some <br>what we call cognitive restructuring which is just  <br>looking at what you're saying to yourself in your <br>head and seeing if that's helpful or not helpful  <br>and it's really useful for the majority of kids <br>that do it although it doesn't help everyone  <br>so it's important to say that this stuff is <br>not a magic bullet that there is no necessarily  <br>cure for anxiety but we know that it can be lots <br>of people can be helped a lot so let's dig into a  <br>little bit and I'm just going to go back so we're <br>going to talk about exposure so and I'm just going  <br>to take you back one two so exposure there can <br>you if you can see it on the left hand side  <br>exposure is what we might do to help get over <br>avoidance so remember avoidance is around  <br>I've been in these situations that make me <br>feel anxious or that when I've been in them  <br>I've started to feel anxious and so what do I do <br>I avoid them I stop going there i stop leaving the  <br>house as a classic example I stop going to school <br>because that makes me feel anxious so what's the  <br>antidote to exposure the antidote to exposure <br>sorry the antidote to avoidance is exposure  <br>fighting fear by facing fear and this is when <br>kids and we do this with adults who are anxious  <br>as well by the way it's not just something <br>nasty and cruel that we only do to children  <br>but you've got to stay in a situation long <br>enough to learn that the thing that you fear  <br>is not going to happen now rest assured we don't <br>just throw kids into their most feared situation  <br>and say there you go you'll be right see you <br>in four hours we get we do it in a step-by-step  <br>a graded sort of step-by-step we often use the <br>analogy of a stepladder hence the little pic in  <br>the side there of kids on a step ladder that's <br>kids in Bhutan or somewhere going to school  <br>apparently that's where how they get to school is <br>up that long ladder anyway that's that's by the  <br>way nothing to do with anxiety but what we do for <br>avoidance is help gradually allow kids and adults  <br>to get back into situations that they've been <br>avoiding to learn that the thing that they're  <br>worried about is probably not going to happen and <br>you need to do it over and over and over again and  <br>when you finish doing it over again you need to <br>do it again and the biggest task often for parents  <br>when we're doing this is helping them not to <br>rescue their kids because kids might get a little  <br>bit distressed or a lot distressed if you're <br>doing it well though they might get a little  <br>bit distressed if you're not doing it so well <br>they'll get too distressed and that suggests that  <br>perhaps you've started too high on the stepladder <br>but a normal natural parent reaction when you see  <br>your child upset is to go and comfort them and <br>take them out of that situation so I often say  <br>to parents look we're going to ask you to go <br>against your natural instincts as a parent it's  <br>not going to help them if you go and rescue them <br>they've got to stick in there long enough that  <br>they learn that it's going to be ok now obviously <br>you don't you don't throw them into something  <br>where it's 10 out of 10 on the anxiety ometer you <br>might pop them and they might choose and this is  <br>actually a really crucial part they might choose <br>to go into a situation where they feel 3 or 4 out  <br>of ten on the anxious scale but and over time <br>the 3 drops to a 2 and then a 1 and then a 0  <br>and then they go actually this is a bit <br>boring now and you go yes hallelujah  <br>so that's exposure fighting fear by facing <br>fear what else do we do we look at worried  <br>thinking so remember we've already said earlier <br>that for parents and children who are anxious  <br>they often think about the world and a negative <br>catastrophic way they look for the worst to happen  <br>and I've noticed remember I've got a background <br>of anxiety myself I notice sometimes my brain  <br>almost actively scanning what am I what <br>can I be worried about what should I worry  <br>about what am I worried about that would be <br>looking for threat so that's my brain and you  <br>see that point there that third point it says <br>attentional bias towards threat my attention  <br>is looking out for threat so I'm more likely to <br>see a threat and I make this assumption that bad  <br>things threatening things happen to me not <br>to other people there's something special  <br>about me and that so this is a tricky thing that <br>we have to help parents and kids get around is  <br>actually looking at the world in a different light <br>maybe there are things about the world that you're  <br>not seeing because it's almost like you're seeing <br>the world not through rose tinted glasses but  <br>perhaps through black tinted glasses so but maybe <br>there are other ways of looking about the world so  <br>some of helping them in this regard is helping <br>them see different things that they haven't been  <br>looking about now I've got a little video <br>to illustrate this attentional bias so this  <br>that shows that actually we think sometimes we <br>are attending to everything that goes on in the  <br>world but we're not now some of you may have seen <br>this video before and if you have that's cool but  <br>not everybody will have so this is a <br>short test and I want you to do the test  <br>I want you to take part I want you to follow the <br>instructions and see what see how it goes for you<br>this is an awareness test<br>how many passes does the team in white make<br>the answer is 13<br>but did you see the moonwalking bear<br>so that that ad was was actually from the <br>UK it was about looking out for cyclists  <br>but the point is that you don't always see <br>everything that goes on about you and you  <br>can train your brain to look for other <br>things that it's not naturally looking  <br>for so when we're working with kids and again <br>we might use that video or something like that  <br>just to highlight to kids that actually there are <br>things that are going on around them that they're  <br>just not aware of because their brain is <br>tuned to looking at things in a particular way  <br>so it's how do you tune your brain in to look at <br>other things around you like actually I've done  <br>this a hundred times before and it hasn't worked <br>out badly other people do this all the time and it  <br>never works out badly for them maybe that's enough <br>to get me into that situation and let me stay  <br>in that situation long enough to find out that <br>that's right the bad things don't really happen  <br>all right now I've only got a <br>couple of slides left so we're just  <br>sort of coming to the end so if you've got some <br>questions and I see there's some in there already  <br>feel free to throw them in now because <br>now's a good time and so we can get to them  <br>so often when we're working with kids as I've <br>sort of mentioned already we're not just seeing  <br>the child as a young person we're typically <br>working with the family with the whānau  <br>so we might be working with parents we might be <br>psycho education kind of we use some flash words  <br>in psychology don't we which I think sometimes <br>just caused confusion for everybody basically  <br>the gist there is it's really useful for <br>people to know what's going on for them  <br>so you you might explain almost <br>like we've done in this talk today  <br>you might explain to somebody when we first find <br>out they're suffering from anxiety that this is  <br>what anxiety is and this is what happens because <br>knowledge is power right and if you have got the  <br>knowledge about what's going on for you you might <br>have some more power to do something about it  <br>we might have to work with parents on managing <br>their own anxiety because remember little people  <br>learn from big people so if big people are anxious <br>little people might learn that so it might and  <br>the number of times I've worked with anxious kids <br>and parents have gone to me I think like that too  <br>it's like no kidding me too so you might <br>have to work as a parent on your own anxiety  <br>we often when we're working with young children <br>too it's about us taking control of the situation  <br>as as a therapist as a psychologist and giving <br>that to the parents and ultimately giving it  <br>to the child but giving that to them in a <br>supported structured way so kids feel safe  <br>we talk with parents about how not to rescue their <br>kids out of situations now this is all done with  <br>the kids full knowledge it's not secrets and lies <br>so kids are fully aware that they're getting into  <br>this situation and what's going to happen and <br>we talk about how kids can learn to manage their  <br>emotions how they can learn to calm themselves <br>down without having to run and seek comfort from  <br>somebody else and I'm not saying seeking comfort <br>from a parent is a bad thing but when it's when  <br>we're talking about anxiety it can sometimes get <br>in the way and sometimes keep the anxiety going  <br>so really we're talking about working with <br>the whole family about what you're doing  <br>so that's the behavior and about what <br>you're thinking and that's the cognitive bit  <br>now lastly just some recent developments we know <br>that there's been lots of developments on the  <br>internet around internet delivered therapy and <br>in fact some of there's some research going on  <br>literally beneath my feet down on in our <br>faculty of health at vic uni and they are  <br>doing some research around the effectiveness <br>of internet delivered anxiety management or  <br>anxiety treatment programs and there are some <br>really good ones about so that's great the other  <br>thing I put there is mindfulness mindfulness <br>as some of you be aware is kind of like that  <br>the term of the day everything it seems is <br>delivered with mindfulness at the moment  <br>and I put my hand up I'm a fan of mindfulness <br>and I do mindfulness as a regular practice  <br>however is it helpful for dealing with anxiety <br>disorders possibly not too much it could be a  <br>useful component but it in itself is <br>probably not going to cut the mustard  <br>so but it's just useful to talk about because <br>I think it's such a buzzword at the moment  <br>that it's useful to touch on look there we go <br>we've come to the end I'm going to stop my screen  <br>share so that I can come on so look I hope you've <br>got something out of that and I hope you've got  <br>do I hope you've got some questions I hope you've <br>got some questions but they're not too hard  <br>so I think Hedwig is going to <br>facilitate that discussion here yeah  <br>nga mihi nui that was amazing thank you Dougal <br>very very nice and thorough explanation of this  <br>phenomenon which seems to be ubiquitous yeah and <br>that's also something everybody can really relate  <br>to a little bit and when it gets to the extent <br>that it's not manageable it's really helpful to  <br>seek help for yeah yeah thank you so much yeah <br>we do have a couple very interesting questions  <br>so I'm just going to read them out to you right <br>so one question was if the diet of the child  <br>would affect their mental health look in some ways <br>I think of course because we're we're holistic  <br>people right so what we what our mind in our <br>brain isn't cut off from the rest of our body  <br>so what goes into your body is going to have some <br>effect right so if you're not having a decent diet  <br>it could have some effect it's probably <br>not a major factor in most cases of anxiety  <br>but I think it's always you know what we talk <br>about three pillars of wellbeing we talk about  <br>diet exercise and sleep and you need those three <br>pillars to be to have a good foundation of mental  <br>wellbeing so even if diet or what you eat <br>I don't mean dieting I mean what you eat  <br>even if even if it's not directly related to <br>anxiety it's useful to think about what's going  <br>into your body because it's you know diet exercise <br>sleep foundational pillars for wellbeing whether  <br>they're strongly connected to anxiety specifically <br>probably not but it's a great thing to be aware of  <br>yeah great thank you and then another one is <br>if you think affect and anxiety being more  <br>highly reported in in females might be that it's <br>associated with the way that females and males  <br>are socialized differently and if there's any <br>research on that Hedwig's probably more of the  <br>expert on the research side than I am but yeah <br>look I definitely think that in our culture and  <br>being a guy myself you know there are all these <br>pressures for how we should pressures is possibly  <br>the wrong word subtle messages about how we <br>should respond and react with our emotions  <br>um so yeah I definitely think there's a there's <br>a social aspect to a shaping aspect to why  <br>females women may present more with <br>anxiety than males I don't think it's  <br>solely genetic at all even if it's genetic I don't <br>even know if there's a touch of genetics in it but  <br>I think how we're shaped by society that we grow <br>up and look the encouraging thing I will say about  <br>that for for those of you who are who are like <br>me over the age of 30 some of you a little more  <br>we grew up in an environment where we <br>didn't really talk about emotions a lot  <br>yeah but what's a really encouraging thing is <br>working here at uni young people the cohort the  <br>generation coming through talk about mental health <br>and wellbeing all the time they're really fluent  <br>enough now that can create a bit of problems <br>because the next generation up kind of goes what  <br>are you talking about I find this really weird and <br>don't know what to say whereas the young people go  <br>oh we talk about our mental health all the time <br>so I think there are some encouraging signs about  <br>young people of all genders being able to <br>talk more freely about their anxiety and  <br>their emotional wellbeing and I think that's <br>a good thing I fully agree yeah that's amazing  <br>actually another interesting question there are <br>so many migrants families in New Zealand and kids  <br>and children might actually have experienced <br>anxiety when migrating to a new country and  <br>especially if parents create anxiety environment <br>in the home potentially and the questions are  <br>twofold so one if there are any strategies you <br>would advise helping cross-cultural parents  <br>and the other one if New Zealand has <br>bilingual psychologists oh wow okay  <br>let me write oh you might have to remind me of <br>the second one so so are there any strategies to  <br>work with migrant parents who are anxious <br>look that help is probably best come from  <br>communities that are similar to them we know that <br>the best people to help one another are those that  <br>are most similar and so yes and there are some <br>really good services within Wellington so there's  <br>I always think of the old name it used to be <br>called refugees and survivors but they'll say  <br>it's not called that anymore that's what it used <br>to be called but they are specialists in working  <br>with migrants particularly from traumatic <br>backgrounds who've come across and I think  <br>you really have to think about that for migrants <br>as the concept of trauma what have they come from  <br>and what have they had to endure to get here are <br>there any bilingual psychologists in New Zealand  <br>I hope so I can't hand on heart tell you who they <br>are I'll tell you two sites to go through to check  <br>out though one New Zealand college of clinical <br>psychologists the second one is the New Zealand  <br>psychological society between those two they cover <br>pretty much most of the professional psychologists  <br>in New Zealand and you can do a search within each <br>of their websites to look for psychologists and  <br>you may well be able to find people who are fluent <br>in different languages as well so I'm sure they  <br>exist but exactly how many they exist in each you <br>know in each different language I'm not sure of  <br>certainly I know I've had to work with <br>interpreters before when we're dealing with  <br>families whose English is not their first <br>language that's a complicating factor as any  <br>of you that have worked with interpreters will <br>know because it's going through somebody else  <br>but it can still be done but again if you can <br>find somebody from that community it's probably  <br>going to be more effective than me by the way the <br>same person says that the photo that was with the  <br>ladder with the kids is maybe from a Chinese <br>village that they know it could be a cliff  <br>village has become famous tourist attraction <br>so there you go there you go yep there we go  <br>I'll tell you we've I've just stole it off the <br>internet so yeah but I do remember that it was  <br>a village about kids having to go up this that <br>crazy ladder which you know kind of shows that  <br>you know what if we can do a lot of things <br>which seem like pretty risky and and we can  <br>do them fine another interesting question if you <br>think that it could be that somebody experiences  <br>anxiety without knowing it and if you would <br>consider that to be a good or bad thing<br>that they are experiencing it without <br>knowing it is that a good basically a  <br>case in which the victims do not know <br>that they are living with anxiety oh  <br>look the immediate thing that springs to mind <br>when was that question is what I was like as a  <br>as a teenager I didn't know I was suffering from <br>anxiety I remember having a whole lot of medical  <br>tests and having because I experienced it in my <br>stomach so I used to get a really upset stomach  <br>and I didn't know and and doctors would go oh we <br>don't know what's going on maybe he's got an ulcer  <br>may you know this was back in the day this was <br>like in the in the 80s we didn't know so much in  <br>the 80s would it have been useful for me to know <br>that it was anxiety yes because I would have known  <br>what to do about it so I think I think that not <br>knowing is not helpful remember knowledge is power  <br>it can be difficult sometimes though if you find <br>out that you're anxious oh my god is that what  <br>it is and it might be a bit of a oh but to me <br>I think personally knowledge is power knowing  <br>what's going on for you is really important yeah <br>that's my thought on that that's really cool yeah  <br>related to that another question that goes <br>into this direction so when you then actually  <br>want to bring that up with the child so before you <br>actually start the latter process and any exposure  <br>well how what is the best way to explain that <br>to explain what anxiety is and if you have any  <br>advice if there are any good videos out there for <br>10 year olds about anxiety and recognizing it 10  <br>year olds look do you know what I'm assuming that <br>the person asking that question is a parent right  <br>so as a parent it might you may not be the best <br>person you may not be the best person to have that  <br>conversation it might be somebody else because as <br>a parent your job isn't to be the psychologist to  <br>be the therapist your job is to be the support <br>crew the comforting arms that they go to when  <br>they're really upset and to support them on and <br>because often I've seen it when and the reason I'm  <br>saying this is often I think it can create tension <br>between parents and kids that a parent's trying to  <br>say I think you're really inside not anxious you <br>don't know what you're talking about well I think  <br>you are I go there I think you know the first <br>step is going to see somebody that's independent  <br>a little bit and I'm not so I'm not trying <br>to say everybody needs to see a psychologist  <br>it could be that it's a wise family relative or <br>friend somebody the kid and the parents trust it  <br>could be that you go to your gp it could be <br>that you go and see a psychologist yeah but  <br>you know I think trying to tell somebody else <br>what they're feeling particularly if you're the  <br>parent runs a few risks of you butting heads <br>with them so helping them explore it together  <br>it's not a video but there's a really good book <br>oh yes and of course I don't have it the the  <br>book that I'm thinking of is called Helping my <br>anxious child I think that's what it's called  <br>the author is Ron Rapee and if you've got a <br>really good memory you'll remember that he's  <br>the guy that wrote the cool kids program that <br>I talked about I think it's called helping my  <br>anxious child but look up his name it's something <br>like that anyway it's a brilliant parent guide  <br>steps to helping your kid and we often recommend <br>that first so that that'll take you through things  <br>to say what to say how to help them without <br>having to see a psychologist it's written by  <br>a psychologist which is cool but yeah it might <br>so that's a resource I'd recommend that's really  <br>cool yeah thanks another question was if there <br>is a link between anxiety and body image issues<br>there could be yes for some people if you <br>remember one of the first slides we talked  <br>about we talked about 14 year old Toni <br>perfectionist worried about everything  <br>that could easily develop into being worried <br>about how I look how I physically look  <br>now it won't be the case for everybody <br>so don't hear what I didn't say  <br>I didn't say that everybody that thinks like <br>that is going to develop body image issues  <br>but it could mean it could develop into being <br>perfectionistic about your image and about your  <br>weight and about your body so yes for some people <br>that can be a pathway yeah good good to know  <br>yeah and another one if a child is distressed <br>after being somewhere we have not been before  <br>like daycare should we investigate somehow before <br>assuming that the child just has to get used to it  <br>oh look I think the principles of that guided of <br>a stepladder approach is a really useful thing for  <br>anywhere that a child feels anxious about going <br>it doesn't you know if you think about daycare  <br>often you do little visits oh well we're going <br>to come along and mum and dad will stay with  <br>mum or dad doesn't matter or mum and mum who <br>doesn't matter parents will stay for a little  <br>bit of time and then we'll go away and then <br>we'll come back and we'll do it a bit longer  <br>it's the same principles of graded exposure you're <br>getting used to being there so you might have to  <br>do that you might have to do that for a situation <br>that a child becomes anxious and you can do that  <br>yourself as long as the anxiety is manageable <br>if they're 10 out of 10 worried and freaking  <br>out that's like okay we need to need to get <br>out of here and we'll start again but there's  <br>lots of times in natural life that you do a graded <br>exposure where you just gently get into it and you  <br>try it out and you try it out and you try it out a <br>bit longer and a bit longer and school visits and  <br>pre-school visits are a classic example of those <br>yeah very good point yeah so it's kind of doing  <br>it in a different way and it's probably also what <br>we do with ourselves sometimes just getting used  <br>to it yeah yeah getting used to it yeah yeah got <br>it yeah well said great I'm gonna squeeze in our  <br>last question if that's okay which is if there if <br>you think or if you have some research around if  <br>CBT is more helpful for anxiety and children with <br>your neurotypical children in comparison with  <br>non neuron divergent ones look there is a <br>whole program there are specific programs  <br>for kids who are neurodivergent and it's a <br>big thing with particularly with kids on the  <br>on the autism spectrum anxiety is often <br>a part of that so yes they can be helped  <br>and yes but that's often doing a specific program <br>with them I think I'm gonna stick my neck out  <br>here I think cool kids has even developed one <br>for kids who are on the spectrum but that may  <br>you know what I'm going to do after we finish I'm <br>going to go away or google it and go have they or  <br>if I just told a lie but I'm pretty sure they and <br>I know there are programs set up from time to time  <br>for neurodivergent kids because they see the world <br>in a different way right and we need to take care  <br>of their specific needs yeah I think the question <br>was also in the direction of ADHD oh yeah yeah yes  <br>well okay okay look same thing I think for ADHD <br>the core difficulty is gonna be keeping them on  <br>task you know and so having a session with a kid <br>who has ADHD at four o'clock in the afternoon  <br>after they've just done a whole day of school it's <br>probably not going to be the best thing you might  <br>want to do it at nine o'clock in the morning which <br>I know interferes with school but you know pluses  <br>and minuses right so we frequently would see <br>kids with ADHD and anxiety and just as effective  <br>okay yeah and we'll probably also some things <br>not everything works for everybody so to figure  <br>these things out yeah for sure absolutely yeah <br>great thank you so much nga mihi nui kia ora<br>Dougal that was really interesting <br>and such a great discussion as well  <br>thank you all for your great questions and <br>hope to see you another time again thank  <br>you Dougal and have a nice evening thanks <br>everybody thanks
