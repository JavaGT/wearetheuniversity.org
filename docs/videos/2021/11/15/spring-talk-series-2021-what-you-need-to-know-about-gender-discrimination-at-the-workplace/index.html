<br>to the last of our four talks in the  <br>Spring Talk Series Psychology bite sized brought <br>to you by Te Kura Mātai Hinengaro School of  <br>Psychology of Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University <br>of Wellington very good to see you all again  <br>and I'm very very pleased to welcome our <br>speaker for today which is Dr Matt Hammond  <br>who is a social psychologist if I may say <br>so and a senior lecturer here in our school  <br>and he's investigating factors that have an impact <br>on romantic relationships so don't get your hopes  <br>up he's not gonna fix your relationship <br>just now but he knows everything around  <br>what type of factors around a relationship within <br>the person but also around the relationship play a  <br>role in actually if it is successful or maybe not <br>and one thing that he's also really investigating  <br>quite thoroughly is biases that people might have <br>in their perspective of others and so for example  <br>one being sexism being one of those potential <br>biases and stereotypes that can have an impact and  <br>this actually is quite strongly linked to gender <br>so this is where his expertise comes in where he's  <br>going to talk about today about gender biases <br>and how they might play a role in especially  <br>also the workplace I think and so we're very very <br>pleased that Matt is going to share his knowledge  <br>around that and maybe has some very important <br>insight and tips for you oh you'd hope so<br>oh and before I forget please put your questions <br>into the q a box we can answer them later  <br>so in the second half of the session we're <br>gonna answer all your questions and I think  <br>Matt is gonna use the chat function <br>as well so keep that close and open<br>kia ora everyone all right I'm gonna <br>share my screen and I also need to  <br>grab the chat for myself nice <br>that's so nice to see everyone<br>so I'll start with a brief <br>pepeha ko Owairaka toku maunga  <br>this is Owairaka in Auckland I really like this <br>old photo because Owairaka is now covered in  <br>houses and you can't really see it's a mountain <br>anymore but it is underneath all of those houses  <br>it is a mountain ko Kaipara toku awa this is <br>the Kaipara river which is north of Auckland  <br>where all of my family are from and so this <br>is kind of home to me Ko Ngati Pakeha toku iwi  <br>Ko Matt Hammond toku ingoa it's nice to <br>be here I'm here to talk to you about  <br>gender discrimination and like Hedwig introduced <br>me I covered it from an angle of relationships I  <br>am most interested in the things that make <br>people hook up and break up in the bits and  <br>between hooking up and breaking up and one of <br>the massive takeaways from all of that research  <br>is that we don't exist in an objective world our <br>relationships aren't what that we think they are  <br>we bring in all of these kinds of things into our <br>relationships such as gender and gender attitudes  <br>that fundamentally changes what it means for <br>us to live in our relationships so if you want  <br>to study relationships you also have to study <br>gender so today's talk is going to be bringing  <br>some of the applied research and I'm going to <br>talk through three key points around gender  <br>discrimination and how they apply to the workplace <br>I'll start with running you through social  <br>categories we'll talk about gender prejudice <br>and how to counter prejudice so we'll start  <br>we'll start with it with a riddle and I'll use <br>the the chat panel here to look at your answers  <br>here is the riddle a father and son are in <br>a disaster the father is pronounced dead  <br>at the scene the son is rushed to the hospital <br>and just as he's headed into the operating theater  <br>the surgeon says I can't operate that <br>boy is my son explain in chat we have  <br>a couple of very quick onto the ball <br>answers any more answers on top of this<br>yeah we have a bunch of stuff of the <br>surgeon as a mother which is actually  <br>the correct answer and I don't actually care <br>about this some people treat this like it's  <br>a test of your sexism and if you don't know <br>if it's a mother then you're sexist which is  <br>annoying and wrong it's not the case the entire <br>point of that was to see social categories  <br>in your mind you've got social categories <br>of things that are linked together  <br>like what it means to be a parent and now we're <br>finally coming into it because yes the original  <br>answer that was supposedly correct to this riddle <br>is that the surgeon is mother in fact if you ask  <br>university aged people nowadays the same <br>riddle they are more likely to say the  <br>boy has two fathers and the surgeon is just <br>his other father and that's just how it is  <br>so depending on either where you heard this riddle <br>the first time or the salient category in your  <br>brain you try and solve this in a logical way <br>that makes sense to the categories that you know  <br>one of the ways that we know that you're <br>doing something logical is we can give the  <br>same riddle to children and if you ask <br>children they say the doctor is a robot  <br>the doctor this is the best answer of all of <br>them so everyone here is less good than children  <br>the doctor is a ghost of the father who died <br>and now he's back as a surgeon to save his son  <br>it's the best answer ever or the entire thing is <br>a dream and what this shows in children's research  <br>is that they haven't really developed the social <br>categories yet to link together father surgeon  <br>and what it means they're kind of just presented <br>with a silly question and they give you a silly  <br>answer like it's all a dream it's a ghost <br>leave me alone why are you asking me questions  <br>so in your heads right now you've got <br>these social categories which is good  <br>it's really good that you've got these social <br>categories things that are connections of places  <br>and professions and relationships and people and <br>groups all of these things you need to survive  <br>one of the ways that social categories help <br>you survive is they add information without you  <br>realizing it a lot of the time an example of this <br>of how social categories add information is check  <br>out this headline which says something like person <br>reunited with animal that is a bad headline right  <br>this headline Auckland woman reunited with cat <br>that's an exciting headline it's a woman from  <br>Auckland this woman is reunited with a cat person <br>reunited with animal is the same actual amount of  <br>information as this you don't know this woman <br>you don't know this cat but it feels like you  <br>do right it feels like you know what cats are like <br>and what women are like and you can kind of build  <br>this information into the story to make it feel <br>like you know way more than you actually do  <br>social categories is also really useful <br>in your brain for removing information  <br>your brain needs to delete information a lot of <br>the time like if you're crossing a busy street and  <br>there are hundreds of people imagine if your brain <br>was doing the same thing you do in your romantic  <br>relationships or with your family and friends and <br>going what are they thinking and feeling right now  <br>what does this person want for dinner where are <br>they going what are their goals every single  <br>person out of 100 people that you meet your brain <br>had to do that well I wonder if they like broccoli  <br>or not I wonder where they're going instead your <br>brain actually just deletes this you use social  <br>categories to turn all of those faces into one <br>group or objects who are in your way and your only  <br>purpose is to avoid the objects they don't have <br>feelings or thoughts anymore your brain needs to  <br>do that to be able to continue on with what you're <br>doing one of my favorite examples of this is  <br>it's a phenomenon called civil inattention and you <br>most often feel it when it breaks when it shifts  <br>if you've ever been at a supermarket just <br>doing your job and then you see someone at  <br>the supermarket who you know and your brain does <br>like a slow motion bend where you're like oh  <br>suddenly I'm in a different frame entirely <br>that's the civil inattention turning off  <br>it's turning off the we're categorizing everyone <br>here as a meaningless individual suddenly I need  <br>to do the exact opposite which is to say this <br>person has thoughts and feelings and I need to  <br>be human being in front of them it's a <br>really fascinating system in our brains  <br>so all together what I'm trying to tell <br>you is this that social categories are just  <br>ways that we process or we fail to process the <br>world we have to use these to be able to survive  <br>there's a big but on this which is <br>the but the world is not reliable  <br>the world is not at all useful with the <br>information that it gives us to build these  <br>categories if you're scrolling through Netflix <br>and you see an ad for the show about surgeons  <br>the ad says look at this there's a man surgeon <br>if you're really invested in firefighting and  <br>you look at a firefighter on Wikipedia this is <br>the photo you get you can go right now and check  <br>you get to see this lovely looking mustachioed <br>man who's a perfect stereotype of what it is  <br>to be a firefighter if you're doing a PowerPoint <br>presentation and you want to show pictures of CEO  <br>and you type in CEO into google you're going <br>to be presented with a lot of these men and  <br>as you go through the world you're collecting <br>information to put in your categories  <br>and information like surgeon firefighter CEO <br>turns out to be a strong white man and equally  <br>information about what it means to be a <br>secretary or a nurse or a primary school  <br>teacher all of those categories get paired with <br>the other things like being a kind white woman<br>so the key takeaway here is this is that <br>your brain does that and it's good that  <br>your brain does that everyone needs social <br>categories to be able to navigate the world  <br>unfortunately the world is full of <br>stuff that makes these social categories  <br>wrong so social categories are not true and <br>they're also not how the world should be  <br>that's what's being presented to us but part of <br>our job as human beings is to start protecting  <br>ourselves from the biased information we get <br>or if we recognize our brains are full of this  <br>to act in ways that make <br>sure we don't reinforce these  <br>and that's where we're moving now from <br>social categories into gender prejudice<br>gender prejudice is judging someone more <br>negatively or positively based on their gender  <br>that's it easy definition there so I can <br>reframe this as this is saying who men women  <br>non-binary non-gendered people who <br>they are and who they should be<br>so those first bits those are the social <br>categories we can't really help having that we  <br>have to have this we have to have an idea in our <br>heads of what it means to be in the men category  <br>in the woman category and in the non-binary <br>category otherwise we couldn't live our lives  <br>this bit over here that's the <br>stereotyping and the prejudice  <br>that is when you say what I have <br>in my head is what the world is  <br>and what the world should be the <br>world should be what I have in my head  <br>so let's go through kind of how this happens I'm <br>about to show you a bunch of faces the faces look  <br>like these faces here and I can promise you that <br>you can say anything you want about these people  <br>the reason you can say anything you <br>want without hurting their feelings  <br>is that none of these people are real they're <br>all fake they're all fake people they don't exist  <br>it's the coolest thing in the world and if I had <br>three more hours of the seminar it would be three  <br>hours of us going to this website and clicking <br>refresh to see new faces this is machine learning  <br>generated faces and if you haven't seen it before <br>you're so welcome for the rest of your evening  <br>but I'm gonna show you faces from here so they're <br>not real people you can't hurt their feelings so  <br>let's start and I'm gonna I'll get you to do <br>it in chat first and then I'll show you some  <br>of the answers that students have come up with or <br>other people I've presented to have come up with  <br>so what I want you to do in chat <br>is describe this person yeah  <br>describe it what you like what you do <br>for a job what traits does she have<br>office job or accountant I like it yeah  <br>yeah I get certainly I get office job <br>accountancy vibes from that I like that<br>adult able-bodied person could be doing anything <br>affluent and educated her name is Karen she sells  <br>real estate she is a real estate seller that's <br>my favorite one so far she's really concerned  <br>with her appearance and she sends back <br>her coffee it's not hot enough salesperson<br>any more any more for this person here<br>a lawyer oh yeah I think she'd be a good lawyer <br>here's what some other people have come up with  <br>she's politically conservative she's polite <br>but she's quick to anger she's concerned that  <br>her home looks nice my favorite one of all <br>time is that she likes visiting wineries  <br>all right what about this this chap here let's <br>describe him what does he do for a job what's  <br>he like what is he like as a human being would you <br>want to hang out with him tell me a bit about him<br>he's an actor yeah I yeah I can see him being an <br>actor he's got actorly beard could be a comedian  <br>tv anchor shows oh sorry he's <br>he's universally someone who was  <br>in front of other people IT security <br>confident and successful the tech CEO<br>plumber yeah let's get one more for this <br>for this chat charismatic but he knows he's  <br>good looking yeah that puts people off too this <br>guy he knows he's hot so he makes him less hot  <br>other people have said he's in a high status job <br>that actually came up here as well CEO in finance  <br>maybe he has a younger romantic partner he likes <br>adrenaline activities apparently he likes jumping  <br>out of planes and going surfing and finally <br>describe this describe them what are they like<br>student student psych major computer programmer <br>a social worker oh I like these answers<br>what qualities what what kind of person<br>non-binary board game geek down to earth and nerdy <br>in a good way a bit shy nice nice person a bit shy  <br>loves chess kind yeah nailed it this is when <br>people see this person they go politically  <br>liberal works in IT they're non-judgmental <br>they're a bit nerdy they're a bit shy  <br>that's pretty amazing right <br>how did your brains do that  <br>your brain is doing something really interesting <br>with stereotypes here where we all tend to fall  <br>along the exact same kinds of judgments that <br>we start making about people so when presented  <br>with a woman for example there are these social <br>categories that get linked with women that came up  <br>so someone who's empathetic who's aware of <br>morals who's slightly vulnerable to harm  <br>perhaps someone who is overly emotional socially <br>competent but maybe too socially competent where  <br>they could be manipulative socially or <br>sexually as well as being competitive  <br>for men often CEO resilient capable providers <br>logical decisive someone who's unemotional  <br>perhaps sexually unaware or <br>socially unaware and aggressive<br>so what we're doing here is we've <br>been asked to infer information  <br>we were asked to infer information <br>about people who I explicitly told you  <br>don't exist so that's the hardest job of all right <br>is you had to come up with traits about people  <br>who don't even exist in the world so there's <br>no way you could be right but somehow  <br>all of those answers cluster around these same <br>things and that's because when we're asked  <br>to do that when we're asked to come up with <br>information about a human being we go to our  <br>stereotypes we go to our social categories <br>of who people are and who they should be<br>I think the the super obvious application <br>of this is imagine you're at a workplace  <br>and you have to infer a lot of information about <br>someone based on very little stuff you get a cv  <br>and that cv has a name a gender identity there and <br>you have to go would this person be good for an IT  <br>job would they be nice to work with would they <br>fit in with a nerdy culture or would they fit  <br>in with our skydiving surfing culture all of <br>this information starts getting filtered through  <br>our stereotypes instead of through <br>what is actually happening in the world<br>that pattern I told you about of this kind of <br>different things that get linked with being woman  <br>and being linked with being men is part of what <br>is called ambivalent sexism ambivalent sexism was  <br>discovered labeled by Peter Glick and Susan Fisk <br>a long time ago and it has stood the test of time  <br>it's one of my favorite psych theories out of <br>every single psych theory ever it's that good  <br>and every single country where researchers have <br>gone to measure people's beliefs about gender  <br>they did the exact same thing that your brains <br>just did then women being empathetic capable maybe  <br>a bit touchy around how they look and really <br>emotional at times men being unemotional but  <br>logical these things come up in every single <br>country where they are measured in the world so  <br>the takeaway here is that these are all prejudices <br>and prejudices contain positive bits and  <br>negative bits and and positive here <br>isn't meant to say they're good things  <br>positive here is just the valence of the word <br>like empathetic is a positive word because  <br>if someone told you you are empathetic that feels <br>good if someone told you you are not empathetic  <br>that feels bad so that's where positive <br>comes from it's not making any claims about  <br>the effects which are all bad effects <br>all of these effects have disadvantages  <br>and this is kind of the crux of my talk today is <br>one of the really most difficult things to change  <br>in gender discrimination is figuring out all of <br>the things that can make up gender discrimination  <br>so my job right now is to convince you <br>of how those positive sounding words  <br>have disadvantages first of all positive <br>words that are attributed to different groups  <br>emphasize opposition between groups <br>and difference between groups  <br>so if I say woman are kind men are strong <br>although those are positive words for each group  <br>it emphasizes those two groups as really <br>different and perhaps in opposition to one another<br>research overwhelmingly shows that <br>women and men are mostly the same  <br>on just about everything you can <br>possibly measure the overlaps are so high<br>there is always more variation within any gender <br>than when you're comparing different gender groups  <br>so men are more different to other men than men <br>on average are different to women on average  <br>another problem with these positive prejudices <br>is that they tend to kind of cluster around  <br>particular groups and so they're not allowed to <br>belong to other groups if you have a third gender  <br>possibility not only is that gender in opposition <br>to the first two those first two have already  <br>taken kind and strong and so now we're left with <br>things like shy nerdy all of these things try and  <br>separate out in our minds to be clear categories <br>so when we have really strong stereotypes that  <br>belong to a particular gender we end up excluding <br>and perhaps opposing all other categories<br>positive prejudices also remove your <br>personal autonomy and your choice  <br>because you look at these and <br>you go ah these are nice words  <br>woman being empathetic and sensitive men being <br>logical and resilient why can't we all just  <br>learn to to accept our own strengths <br>and get along in the world the reason  <br>is because that might work for you or it might <br>work for someone who's made a career out of being  <br>logical and resilient as a man but for people <br>in that group who don't want to do that thing  <br>they're out of luck so you get headlines that look <br>like this you go where have all the women CEOs but  <br>where have they gone is the wrong thing to say <br>they were never there in the first place where  <br>are all the women CEOs to begin with and where <br>are all the men teachers where have they all gone<br>even when someone succeeds in a particular <br>workplace it's still not given them their own  <br>autonomy over that success so here is a recent <br>story from this week from the New York Times  <br>and the story is an account of someone <br>who is a black woman who succeeded  <br>in the workplace and then was told that <br>success was due to diversity programs  <br>was not due to any qualities of the human it <br>was due to these characteristics that meant  <br>there were all of these advantages so there <br>is no more autonomy and no more choice now  <br>because people are saying ah this is a <br>group that has all of these advantages<br>take for example something like <br>women being vulnerable to harm  <br>this is a really huge gender gap that comes up  <br>in fisheries fisheries in the United States is <br>one of the most highly paying jobs you can get  <br>and it's one of the most gigantic gender gaps that <br>exist as well here are the actual statistics of  <br>fishing permit holders who are women on the <br>left-hand graph those little things there are  <br>numbers of people and on the right-hand graph <br>numbers of men like a staggering number right  <br>and you can see how this directly ties into <br>beliefs about woman being vulnerable to harm  <br>because that vulnerability to harm is linked in <br>with the fishing industry being a really dangerous  <br>profession now guess what the fishing industry is <br>a really dangerous profession so who do you put in  <br>that profession the people who are less vulnerable <br>to harm and then they all die they all get killed  <br>because it's a really dangerous profession so we <br>have a gender inequality over here that is just a  <br>straight mirror of that first gender inequality <br>this positive ascription to a gender group  <br>of oh this they need protection from harm means <br>that they get excluded from these jobs and on  <br>the other hand men have this inequality here <br>of being much more likely to be killed at work<br>so what I really want you to take away from this <br>is that seemingly positive and negative prejudices  <br>they disadvantage just all of us everyone <br>here loses out in some way because of positive  <br>descriptions that are for other groups that are <br>then omitted from your own group and I've left out  <br>a big chunk that I don't need to explain to you <br>about how bad negative prejudices are obviously  <br>negative prejudices are really bad <br>for you but they also do disadvantage  <br>everyone the people who really strongly hold <br>negative beliefs are not happier for it they don't  <br>think of themselves as better people they're <br>not happier with their own lives in a bunch of  <br>my research specifically on relationships I show <br>that the least satisfied people out of everyone  <br>in relationships are people who hold really <br>strongly negative hostile sexist attitudes  <br>those are the people who are least equipped to <br>deal with the realities of living in a real-life  <br>real-world relationship so this is it's bordering <br>on the fantasy of of someone who is sitting there  <br>and they're looking out at all of the negativity <br>in the world and thinking to themselves man they  <br>must be feeling insecure and bad about themselves <br>but that is kind of what is happening that is  <br>that is at least empirically there's a lot of <br>evidence that those people are the least happy<br>so let's get into the the more positive side <br>I say more positive with some hesitancy there  <br>because if we knew how to counter prejudice we <br>would have done it if social psychologists had the  <br>secret all along we wouldn't hide it we would tell <br>everyone and we would counter it so what I'm going  <br>to share with you are some steps toward countering <br>prejudice and some steps toward reducing  <br>gender discrimination as well as some things to <br>look out for and some common mistakes to avoid  <br>so the first common mistake is to look <br>at instances of gender discrimination  <br>and you don't even need to go back a month in the <br>news you can type this into google any time you  <br>want and just get a horrific amount of information <br>and often that information gets phrased like  <br>this that there is bullying that there is sexual <br>assault and harassment as part of a boys club and  <br>what these are trying to do really appropriately <br>is target that cluster of negative attitudes down  <br>the bottom left they're saying oh there is all <br>this aggression that is directed towards women  <br>as being overly emotional or competitive there is <br>all of this fighting that is pushing down and what  <br>we need to do as a company is to get rid of all <br>of the hostility and then we'll be okay so that's  <br>where that sits and I 100 percent agree with that <br>as long as it is not the point at which you stop  <br>unfortunately I think a lot of the time <br>people think that that's where it stops  <br>guess what happens though if you present a huge <br>report saying women in this company are victims  <br>of harassment and sexual assault and they <br>need more protection as you reinforce the  <br>other prejudices you reinforce this idea that <br>women are particularly vulnerable to harm  <br>they are particularly aware of morals and culture <br>that men are particularly sexually unaware that  <br>men are aggressive and men are unemotional we know <br>from all of our research that those attitudes as  <br>well feed into those same problems that are trying <br>to be addressed so a culture that has a lot of  <br>harassment that has a boys club that is the same <br>culture that emphasizes woman being vulnerable to  <br>harm that is the same culture that emphasize men <br>being unemotional and aggressive and competitive  <br>with other men for status so a common <br>mistake is kind of giving up once you've done  <br>the hostility towards women and forgetting the <br>prejudice comes in lots of different flavors  <br>this is not just my research this is research <br>by Jennifer Eberhardt who I think is probably  <br>one of the world leading researchers in <br>how to change prejudice her research is  <br>based in the states so focuses a lot on <br>prejudice towards African-Americans but  <br>the underlying principles are the <br>same across all kinds of prejudices  <br>her research consistently says if you just <br>point out an inequality that makes things  <br>worse if you say we have a group over <br>here they are really disadvantaged  <br>and that group is already stereotyped as <br>being emotional empathetic vulnerable to harm  <br>just labeling that inequality is only going <br>to reinforce those existing stereotypes which  <br>make them relatively disadvantaged so Jennifer <br>Eberhardt says you need to use those inequalities  <br>to identify biases you need to use <br>those inequalities to challenge  <br>the things that make up all of the all of <br>the harassment all of the discrimination  <br>if you are pointing it out you are probably not <br>helping and potentially just making things worse  <br>so instead researchers tend to recommend <br>what is called coordinated cultural change  <br>which is actually quite good for you as a <br>human being because the responsibility is  <br>not just on you the responsibility is on everyone <br>around you as well and your entire organization  <br>so coordinated cultural change requires a targeted <br>message that is widely shared amongst people so  <br>it's kind of like a social movement what that <br>change does is it adjusts the normative beliefs  <br>so a famous example of this most recently was <br>the me too movement so this is a movement that  <br>wasn't just pointing out inequality it was using a <br>really gigantic widespread inequality in an effort  <br>to change bias and it did that by personalized <br>messages of people's actual experiences with  <br>harassment and spread through social networks <br>so statistically researchers have shown that  <br>tolerance of sexual assault has reduced across <br>time as a result you can never say it's causal but  <br>across time that time sequence did <br>the stock market ticker thing of  <br>dropping with the exact precision that you'd <br>expect if it was due to the me too movement<br>another common mistake is that it's really <br>tough to get rid of those positive prejudices  <br>I mean and I know it's it's all of <br>these just sound like nice words<br>but like I said if you have nice words <br>attributed to your group unfortunately you get  <br>the pain of omission because you are not the <br>nice words that attributed to other groups  <br>so if I were to tell you about my two friends one <br>of my friends is very smart and the other one of  <br>my friends is very very pretty what your brain <br>just did was like well the smart one is nerdy  <br>likes books like science fiction but is not at <br>all popular probably a bit ugly no one likes them  <br>the pretty one has lots of friends very sociable <br>is very dumb but I didn't say any of those things  <br>but your brains did it right when I'm like one of <br>them is smart one of them is pretty it's because  <br>emitting information is actually very <br>sneaky and our brains pick up on it<br>so when you're trying to coordinate these <br>social changes a mistake is to say ah our  <br>bunch of CEOs are not diverse enough <br>all of our CEOs need to be more diverse  <br>and we've fixed this problem you haven't fixed <br>the problem you've fixed half of the problem the  <br>other half is saying we need to put men in roles <br>where men get to be empathetic sensitive express  <br>emotions so all of this requires coordinated <br>cultural change where if you are trying to  <br>shift stereotypes they have to shift in both <br>directions otherwise it doesn't really go anywhere  <br>so what this is relying on is that when you've <br>got multiple diversity in all of your positions  <br>it's really useful for role <br>modeling for future generations  <br>and I'll tell this to you if you are currently <br>in charge of a company or hiring decisions  <br>diversity experimentally and in kind <br>of longitudinal psychological research  <br>where we're tracking people over <br>time and seeing how groups change  <br>groups that are more diverse are just straight <br>up better at being in groups they're better at  <br>problem solving they're better at getting goals <br>done they're better at engaging with other people  <br>they're more creative groups and it's obvious <br>why if you've got lots of different experiences  <br>lots of different networks that make up the people <br>in the group you're not you don't have redundancy  <br>you don't have people who are doing the exact same <br>job so if you need to sell this kind of change to  <br>someone you can sell it as a net positive for the <br>success of a business so I've talked a bit about  <br>let's fix the world which is true but also can <br>make people feel a bit like oh great all I need  <br>to do Matt is just fix society and just fix the <br>organization I work in and then we'll be okay  <br>and so yeah I definitely hear you so if we zoom <br>this down and okay what can you do specifically  <br>what can you do is you can <br>find ways to individuate people  <br>we know already from this talk you've <br>got a brain full of social categories  <br>all of those social categories have a bunch <br>of stuff about women and men already in there  <br>and your brain will rely on that anytime <br>you're asked to infer information  <br>make some judgments of someone so the more <br>you can find ways to individuate people  <br>find information specifically about them the <br>better you will be at judging them regardless  <br>of whether you're judging a new hire you're <br>judging someone who's coming up for a promotion  <br>you're judging a boss of yours in giving a <br>feedback form of how good they are at being a boss  <br>all of those judgments will be <br>better if you individuate them<br>so one of the things you can do is make sure <br>that you're following things that are not  <br>relying on categories so in a job interview <br>panel where you're selecting someone your job  <br>position can say something like this of like how <br>much can this person bring something that's new  <br>to our team force yourself to find a way of <br>say what's new about them for the people here  <br>you are specifically thinking <br>about what they are doing relative  <br>to what is here and focusing on diversity focusing <br>on experience that will make you better judges<br>another thing you can do it's a bit of a pop <br>psych favorite but is does she like broccoli  <br>this is an experiment which is kind of a famous <br>it's called the broccoli test if you want to look  <br>it up you can ask yourself this question anytime <br>before you need to evaluate someone on something  <br>that matters it sounds silly and it's not going <br>to solve all of prejudice ever but experimentally  <br>with FMRI machine scanners so you know it's <br>true experimentally if you get people to say  <br>how much does this person like broccoli before <br>you make a judgment of them you do switch them  <br>into an individuating mindset where they're <br>now thinking about this person specifically<br>the final thing you can do is gather as much <br>information you can about this person as possible  <br>and this is especially important if you can't <br>help social category information so anything  <br>that's to do with appearance like gender ethnicity <br>age those tend to be immediate and really strong  <br>social categories that get activated so there's <br>a trick called multiple categorization which is  <br>where you kind of blow out that categorization <br>with as much information as possible so if I  <br>tell you okay yeah this person is a middle-aged <br>woman but they're also a Kiwi they like rugby  <br>they're a vegetarian they're a coffee drinker <br>they like reading sci-fi and they have a mortgage  <br>if you can increase the amount of information <br>where you're getting shared categories with  <br>people so I've tried to pick some here that <br>will hopefully resonate with the audience  <br>the more you've got shared categories <br>that overlap the more you play down  <br>those initial big categories <br>like age gender and ethnicity<br>so I'll wrap things up here here are <br>the key takeaways in any job you need  <br>to be watching out for category indicators <br>anything that's a claim about what women are  <br>what non-binary people should be doing those are <br>flashing warning lights for you to pay attention<br>whenever possible when you're evaluating someone <br>when you're trying to infer information avoid  <br>category information and pursue individuating <br>information even if the only opportunity you have  <br>to do this is ask yourself if they like broccoli <br>and identify the benefits of increasing diversity  <br>I think people get grumpy about tackling <br>prejudice but actually tackling prejudice  <br>means that we are going to get a lot better <br>at our jobs because we're going to bring in  <br>a heap more diversity and we will be exposed to <br>so many more opportunities than we would have  <br>otherwise been before all right that is it from <br>me I'm now going to turn it over to Hedwig and  <br>the q a panel and we can have a chat about gender <br>discrimination or whatever you want to talk about<br>awesome thank you so much Matt that sounds oh <br>super straightforward actually not that difficult  <br>probably needs a little bit of head <br>space to actually do this but yeah  <br>amazing we can we can do something <br>about it I like that positive note  <br>so yeah I always try and be positive with sad <br>things and I try and be sad with positive things  <br>so anytime I'm talking about relationships and <br>love I think I end it quite sadly but this one's a  <br>sad topic so I do want to end it on an optimistic <br>note because I think it is getting better  <br>yeah that's really cool so until the first <br>people put in some questions into the q a box  <br>I have one for you so I wondered when you said <br>that sexism is related to negative relationship  <br>outcomes so people being so what did you mean <br>there is it like be people being less happy  <br>in their relationship then or and what do you <br>think is the mechanism there why would that be  <br>yeah I love those questions so for the first one <br>of what exactly makes a relationship worse this  <br>is a case where you can go down the list and and <br>pick your favorite evaluation of a relationship  <br>so for people who endorse really hostile gender <br>stereotypes where they have extreme views  <br>about the negativity and those negative <br>characteristics of men and women we find  <br>that those people have more relationship <br>problems so things like difficulties with  <br>managing kids difficulties with communication <br>they have lower relationship satisfaction we just  <br>get people to ask how happy you are with <br>your relationship and the third indicator  <br>we tend to use is how much conflict how <br>much argument is there in the relationship  <br>for the mechanism we've looked at a couple the <br>main ones we've found are when you find biased  <br>perceptions which is where the things that people <br>are reporting are happening in their relationship  <br>are not at all what their partner thinks is <br>happening and not at all what observers are seeing  <br>happen so if you get like observers to record a <br>couple having a conversation then they go away and  <br>they say that was a bit negative the observers <br>don't see it their partner doesn't see it it's  <br>basically all in their heads so and it makes <br>sense if someone is coming into a relationship  <br>believing that men and women in society are <br>continually fighting for status that men at  <br>any time could be tricked into a relationship they <br>are going to invent that into their relationship  <br>every time they see their partner do something <br>that's being filtered through a stereotype  <br>and observers can't see it and their partner <br>can't see it which is rough right like  <br>imagine being the partner where you're <br>constantly saying I don't know what I'm  <br>doing wrong because everything I'm doing seems <br>to me like it's positive but I'm continually  <br>being told by the other person as negative makes <br>it really difficult to resolve problems so yeah  <br>so there's a couple of things in chat <br>and yes I'm gonna get them to you  <br>so one of the questions is quite interesting <br>so if you think based on this social category  <br>problem if you think that the recent talk about <br>vulnerability of rural Māori getting access to  <br>vaccination is actually probably damaging and <br>to make that as a category a vulnerable category  <br>yeah I absolutely do and these are things that <br>need to be changed in the framing because there is  <br>a group so we need to get people vaccinated let's <br>just take that as a true statement about the world  <br>and we have all of these efforts but often our <br>efforts get filtered through those same kinds  <br>of stereotyping where the protective tendency <br>turns into this kind of thing that's loaded  <br>with pity it's like oh this group doesn't <br>understand we need to help out this group  <br>and over over doing things so saying okay <br>we will make it easier for this group by  <br>turning up with all of this stuff <br>and getting them to do it and  <br>and what you do there is it seems like you're <br>helping but actually you're taking away autonomy  <br>decision making and agency so a better strategy <br>is to the first thing is just to understand why  <br>any group is resistant there's got to be a reason <br>and the second thing is supporting rather than  <br>telling so rather than patronisingly saying this <br>group doesn't have enough we need to give them  <br>say okay I will go out and talk to this group <br>and ask them what resources they need and we  <br>can help by we can be the other way around <br>right we can be the people who are like here  <br>are the resources you can have the agency for your <br>group to decide what is the best way to do this  <br>another one is does seeing people who fit the <br>stereotype reinforce the stereotype do we need  <br>to do something to immune ourselves <br>when we realize we are seeing those  <br>stereotypes in real life yeah it so it's an <br>interesting question right of the claim is  <br>does anyone actually fit the stereotype or not <br>and if you're seeing people from the outset<br>expecting them to fit the stereotype then they <br>will not only in your own brain but by the way  <br>you behave towards them they'll behave in <br>the way that they're used to behaving and  <br>will go on and on in the cycle so I don't know <br>if people could ever fit the stereotype because  <br>like I said the stereotypes aren't real they're <br>not they're just things that are in our heads  <br>and we're going to get too much philosophical <br>soon so I'll stop that track but I think the the  <br>second point of like what can we do to immunize <br>ourselves towards relying on stereotypes and I  <br>think yeah I think that's a great goal to <br>have and genuinely if you make it a goal  <br>it will be a goal so individuating people <br>takes effort it takes kind of that cognitive  <br>intention because the reason that those social <br>categories are so useful is that shortcuts they  <br>just make the world solved for you without <br>having to think so if you want to get rid of  <br>the stereotypes you have to replace it with the <br>okay I'm meeting someone new for the first time  <br>how can I approach them and get to know them in a <br>way that makes them feel like an individual and me  <br>know this person as an individual if that sounds <br>hard it probably is like by definition social  <br>categories are easy and leads to a lot of errors <br>individuating is harder but hopefully better I  <br>think I've convinced everyone here it seems like <br>we're on board yes and we're going to put the  <br>effort in another one is if you have any tips <br>for if you feel people or someone specifically  <br>is using a social category on you yeah this is <br>so there's a huge area I didn't get into around  <br>prejudice reduction and discrimination reduction <br>where you are being targeted with a prejudice or  <br>discrimination and this is a really tough one <br>to answer and so the first thing I'll say is  <br>I'm not qualified basically so I'm Pakeha I'm <br>a man I've been part of the most advantaged  <br>group since I was born but before I was born I was <br>still part of the most advantaged group even then  <br>so I am not the best person to be answering <br>this question but I can pass on some information  <br>from Jennifer Eberhardt who was in the <br>talk who has some great stuff on this  <br>and her advice which I love is that you don't <br>have to do anything and I think people often  <br>feel pressure to challenge discrimination when <br>they see it and unfortunately that's exhausting  <br>and it means that often you have to put yourself <br>into situations where you're generating conflict  <br>sometimes it's impossible so one of the classic <br>ones for gender discrimination in the workplace  <br>is that women are called overly emotional <br>which is an impossible stereotype to  <br>to counter because if someone calls you overly <br>emotional that's offensive and will by definition  <br>of how humans work make you emotional so you <br>either have to be emotional in your response or  <br>you have to suppress the emotions you're feeling <br>which looks like you're suppressing the emotions  <br>anything you do to challenge it feels like <br>you're confirming it so the first one is  <br>you don't have to do anything that you don't <br>want to the second one is if you confront it  <br>that is a good thing and you are totally within <br>your rights to confront it whenever you see it  <br>because discrimination is about how you feel <br>as a human being there is no objective truth  <br>about what makes something discrimination <br>or not in the psychological terms in legal  <br>terms there's a lot of nonsense but also I <br>can show you headlines and featuring legal  <br>terms and they don't know anything about gender <br>discrimination I've gotten a little rant and I  <br>just lost my train of thought so yeah those are <br>my two things and I have a third thing which is  <br>a call to everyone here like me who is <br>part of an advantaged group in any way  <br>is you are way more responsible than you think you <br>are to stand up and challenge discrimination not  <br>only because as throughout your life you haven't <br>had to but also because research sadly shows that  <br>the most effective discrimination reduction is <br>when someone who's not personally offended by it  <br>challenges it so if you're walking past <br>someone else being discriminated against  <br>and you challenge it people are much more <br>likely to change their behavior because they  <br>feel like it's socially wrong rather than the <br>person who has been targeted by it challenging  <br>it because it feels then like it's a dialogue <br>and it's an argument so yeah you don't have to  <br>it's good when you do and definitely do it for <br>other groups to experience discrimination great  <br>in a supportive way I should definitely emphasize <br>the prior point it's not your job to step in and  <br>tell everyone what you think and how you feel <br>it's your job to be supportive there's also an  <br>interesting comment that is relating or probably <br>maybe comment or question if that's related to  <br>the recent problems that have been found based on <br>AI so that if you feed AI with a lot of resumes  <br>that are from men then this means that they will <br>pick up on that being a male characteristic that's  <br>absolutely right yeah so there is inequality <br>that exists in the world and that's why  <br>social categories and like sometimes social <br>categories reflect real gender inequality and  <br>so that's why I added that it's not how the world <br>should be for example one of my favorite headlines  <br>from a few years ago favorite is a bad word to use <br>one of the most depressing but like oh I love the  <br>way this information is packaged headlines is <br>there are more CEOs in New Zealand named Mark  <br>than there are all women CEOs in New Zealand <br>like that's the scope of gender inequality right  <br>and I didn't tell you that at the start because <br>it's my job to tell you about these biases that  <br>feed into those inequalities not just shock you <br>with inequalities but yeah the world is full  <br>of gigantic inequalities that feed into our <br>brains that feed into machine learning algorithms  <br>so it will just spit out what's put in and <br>so yeah that's a great point I think um<br>some apart from some other comments I really want <br>to put that question out do younger people and  <br>you alluded a little bit to that with the children <br>do younger people rely less on traditional social  <br>categories and if they do what categories do they <br>use to store information everyone uses social  <br>categories for everything but you can have more <br>complex social categories so that last slide I  <br>talked about how you can do what's called multiple <br>categorization of being a coffee drinker having a  <br>mortgage being a fan of a particular sport so <br>we don't have any evidence that younger people  <br>are less prejudiced but it seems like the what <br>we call generation Z or the zoomer generation  <br>they're kind of bringing about a really cool <br>social change specifically around gender  <br>where it's no longer gender binary as <br>being the default and only existence where  <br>multiple categorizations coming to play but <br>we will always need categories so you can  <br>add categories you can turn something into a <br>dimension rather than a box but our brain just  <br>needs these to cope with the world so it's not <br>that it's different and unfortunately it's not  <br>going to solve prejudice either but what will <br>happen is that the information that goes into  <br>categories is going to change over time and the <br>flavor of prejudice is going to change over time  <br>so it's not always going to be the case that <br>men are stereotyped as being strong and women  <br>are stereotyped as being vulnerable to harm <br>the flavor of those can change but they will  <br>change into something different they will not <br>disappear oh I started getting sad again no  <br>society is getting better slowly yes somebody <br>commented it's probably like what we need to do  <br>here is being the third parties being the <br>ones speak up and helping and being like  <br>the helper basically the non-bystander <br>basically yeah yeah exactly yeah  <br>being supportive of that embracing diversity like <br>I said and making it a a positive thing yeah and  <br>then one last one if we are aware of our own <br>privilege what are the most effective ways to be  <br>an ally or challenge prejudices in a way that <br>helps and doesn't instead make things worse  <br>yeah I the two things to keep in mind <br>from the models I was showing you  <br>is to make sure that groups always <br>have they always in a cooperative role  <br>and they always have agency those are the kind of <br>the two main things and often we get that balance  <br>off we say I want to cooperate so much that I <br>take away agency from from the groups involved so  <br>the the most effective way to help is <br>actually the same rule I know you said  <br>this wasn't going to be a relationship talk <br>but I could end this with a relationship tip  <br>is the relationship advice that every relationship <br>psychologist will tell you is the best thing to do  <br>is shut your mouth and listen and that tends to be <br>the key thing here so yeah close your mouth don't  <br>tell people how to live their lives or what <br>they should do but listen to what they need  <br>and be supportive in that way and same for <br>your partner and your mum and and your dog<br>I love that that was a very nice closing <br>statement thank you so much Matt that was awesome  <br>so what I would like to do is to thank you and all <br>the other panelists who are previous speakers some  <br>of them are around Dougal and Mark and of course <br>also Carolyn who the four of you gave so much  <br>interesting information and I think was really <br>cool to see the good discussion as well and just  <br>as a heads up we're gonna send out a little survey <br>very short just a couple of questions we want to  <br>hear what you liked what topics you're interested <br>in if we should do this again and what we should  <br>change hopefully we can do this next time in <br>person and actually do that with you discuss it  <br>in a room together and that that will be much <br>more fun thank you very much ngā mihi nui oh  <br>I also want to reiterate that thank you so much <br>Hedwig for facilitating all these talks you've  <br>been a fantastic introducer and question sorter <br>reader outer person it's been it's been really  <br>cool to see it's been very very much fun I have <br>to say with these amazing colleagues really  <br>good to see you all mā te wā next time maybe next <br>spring we'll see have a good evening kia pai to pō</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
