victoria<br>university of wellington<br>my name is hepburg eisenberg and i have<br>the great pleasure to introduce dr<br>carolyn bulger to you in a moment<br>just mentioning again<br>so if you have any questions throughout<br>the talk please just post them into the<br>q a box we will come back to them later<br>um in the second part of the session<br>uh and uh you can also then use your<br>raise your hand um button if you want to<br>um whatever you feel more comfortable<br>with<br>dr carolyn wilshere is a senior lecturer<br>here at<br>herrera<br>and<br>he<br>she has been here for quite a while<br>doing uh neuroscience research uh she's<br>interested in cognitive processes and<br>how they how they can be seen in the<br>brain basically<br>and um also not only in terms of<br>language and other cognitive processes<br>but also um<br>trying to understand better how we can<br>actually basically conceptualize<br>psychopathology in a broader sense so<br>this is another interesting branch she's<br>um<br>involved in<br>um<br>she's using brain voyager to travel<br>through the brain<br>and she's gonna be our stella expert for<br>the session on neuroscience versus<br>neurobabble<br>a road map for evaluating brain science<br>claims so i'm looking forward to hear<br>more from you carolyn and please fire<br>hello good evening everybody welcome<br>um i'm going to be talking today<br>and thank you hedwig for that lovely<br>introduction yes my areas of specialty<br>are neuropsychology and cognitive<br>neuroscience so i'm interested in what<br>we can learn<br>about the mind how we think from uh<br>studying the brain<br>um what i'm going to be talking about<br>today is kind of a little bit of a<br>skeptical view it's more focused towards<br>uh warning you off some of the more sort<br>of highfalutin claims that are going<br>around out there in the literature<br>um so i've called my talk today<br>neuroscience versus neurobabble a<br>roadmap for evaluating science claims<br>and i'm going to be sort of picking<br>apart and exploding a few myths that<br>have been<br>thrown around recently about<br>neuroscience and what we can learn from<br>it<br>all right so let me<br>just okay<br>it's great it's going all right so just<br>to get you going<br>we're being bombarded constantly in the<br>media and wherever we're looking with<br>mentions of the brain so everything<br>lately seems to have some reference to<br>the brain and it seems that anybody<br>who's trying to sell anything to us or<br>anybody who has some belief that they're<br>trying to convince us of is making use<br>of the brain in all kinds of ways and<br>here's just a few clips that i took some<br>of them i came across looking at youtube<br>they find me because i often look at<br>this kind of brain stuff in order to do<br>my research so these things find me um<br>but i'm sure that they're not uncommon<br>common in your own feeds if you're<br>looking at twitter or facebook and so<br>forth that one i love very much improve<br>your brain full brain workout for better<br>brain health but you'll notice there<br>train your brain for success and most<br>recently train your brain to be happy so<br>the brain is starting to<br>come into play when we're looking at<br>things like mindfulness techniques<br>meditation techniques people are<br>starting to talk about the brain there<br>too<br>so we're seeing it everywhere now i'm<br>going to take three examples in this<br>little talk um and work through them<br>with you and i think they're things that<br>you will have heard of you've come<br>across<br>um in the media and elsewhere and i'm<br>going to pretty much unpick them for you<br>and perhaps not in an overly<br>complementary way all right so the first<br>claim that you might have come across if<br>you've you know seen any ads for<br>lumosity or those brain training sites<br>you might have come across this claim<br>that brain training games can improve<br>your mental flexibility and maybe even<br>stave off<br>degeneration from old age and possibly<br>even dementia so there's a lot of<br>money now mixed up in in brain training<br>games with these great promises of this<br>improved cognitive skill and and<br>possibly even avoidance of dementia so<br>sorry<br>the second one that you might have seen<br>a little bit<br>is comes from the areas now we're<br>looking at various interventions such as<br>mindfulness and other psychological<br>interventions and the brain is starting<br>to play a bigger and bigger part in<br>those sorts of claims so eight weeks of<br>mindfulness will change your brain was a<br>recent headline that made it around a<br>lot of news media we'll talk about that<br>one too<br>and finally you might have seen some<br>claims like this where people are using<br>neuroscience to kind of<br>um uh<br>to to to provide a<br>some sort of causal uh explanation for<br>why certain people do certain things<br>and one that came up a few years ago<br>maybe about eight years ago big<br>headlines in the news was that<br>psychopaths actually have brain<br>abnormalities therefore it's not their<br>fault that they're psychopaths they have<br>a brain disorder and we need to be<br>sympathetic to them so we're going to<br>look at that one too so they're my three<br>claims that we're going to unpick and<br>and as you'll see as we go along they<br>they fall down but in slightly different<br>ways and i'm going to show you a little<br>road map for you that you can use for<br>yourself when you come across these<br>claims<br>so you can try and work out sort the<br>sheeps from sheep from the goats if you<br>like<br>now before i start unpacking the<br>individual claims i wanted to share with<br>you this quite famous study that was<br>done a few years ago it's actually 2008<br>and it was titled the seductive allure<br>of neuroscience explanations<br>the study was looking at students of<br>psychology and some of them were very<br>early beginning students and others were<br>quite senior they'd had some years of<br>psychology study<br>and they were asked to read various<br>studies and judge how satisfying they<br>found the conclusions so you can<br>probably already guess where i'm going<br>to be going with this i'm going to be<br>showing you that the students judged the<br>conclusions of studies to be better if<br>they mentioned something about the brain<br>even if the things they mentioned about<br>the brain actually didn't add in any<br>substantive way to the explanation<br>itself it was almost incidental let me<br>show you one of the examples<br>so in one of the studies that these<br>students were asked to read about it was<br>evidence showing that people often<br>overestimate what other people know when<br>they know something themselves<br>and the study concluded at the end that<br>people are limited in how much they can<br>perspective take how much they can place<br>themselves in the position of another<br>person and get a perspective on what<br>that person would know from their<br>experience and context<br>okay so the students were asked to read<br>this study and its conclusion and<br>critically<br>one group of the students about half of<br>them was also given an extra line<br>in the in conclusion and they were told<br>that brain scans indicate that this<br>limited perspective taking happens<br>because of the frontal lobe circuitry<br>known to be involved in self-knowledge<br>so if you can see that doesn't really<br>add anything to the explanation of the<br>study does it so the explanation is we<br>overestimate what other people know<br>because we're limited in how much we can<br>perspective take<br>and just knowing where in the brain that<br>is going on doesn't actually give us<br>much more information about how we do it<br>or why we're limited in it it's kind of<br>by the by<br>but importantly in this study the the<br>students rated those explanations as<br>significantly more satisfying than the<br>ones that didn't include the brain<br>information<br>so weisberg and several other<br>researchers said since then have have<br>focused on this kind of this allure that<br>the brain has for us the way we can be<br>seduced into thinking something is real<br>science if it includes the brain and how<br>can we how can we protect ourselves<br>against this problem how can we insulate<br>ourselves against this seductive allure<br>if you like<br>and i'm going to show you a little bit<br>of a road map that might help<br>right so we're going to start with this<br>claim about the brain training games<br>all right so brain training games i'm<br>going to take you over to lumosity here<br>which is<br>quite a well-known site that offers you<br>various brain training games can<br>everybody see that just change to the<br>luminosity page you see that great<br>okay so if you go on you have to to get<br>access to all the tests you have to<br>subscribe it's quite expensive<br>um<br>probably lumosity will love me for<br>sharing this with you they'll probably<br>think this is terrific for their<br>advertising um but here we're just using<br>the free game that's available now and<br>i'm going to show you what the games<br>involve so this game involves having to<br>do two things at once i'm probably going<br>to mess it up dreadfully while you're<br>all watching<br>let's load it up and see so there are<br>some leaves that are going to be moving<br>across the pla page and when the leaves<br>are one color we have to press to say<br>that they're what direction they're<br>moving in and when they're in another<br>color we have to press to say what<br>direction they're pointing in it's<br>telling me what to do i'm going to mess<br>this up terribly use the arrow keys use<br>an arrow key to continue<br>alright here's our instructions<br>pay attention to the colour of the<br>leaves<br>press any arrow key to continue<br>whenever the orange sleeves appear we<br>have to indicate which way they're<br>moving so those leaves are moving left<br>so i press left<br>when the green leaves appear we have to<br>indicate which way they're pointing so<br>those green leaves are pointing up<br>okay oh i got one right<br>and so on you get the idea they're all<br>orange there we go<br>all right so in those little tasks you<br>know it's kind of a little multitasking<br>or task switching thing where you have<br>to change from doing one thing to<br>another pay attention to the cues in<br>order to work out what it is that you're<br>doing<br>cute so there's a lot of different tasks<br>that are offered in lumosity and the<br>promise is<br>that<br>if you<br>religiously practice the tasks on a<br>regular basis you'll get these benefits<br>for your overall cognition and let me<br>take you back to the slide let's talk<br>about it<br>all right so some of the claims of<br>lumosity and other brain training games<br>are that they're based on the latest<br>neuroscience and we'll talk about<br>whether or not that is true in a moment<br>and more importantly they claim that<br>they will cause brain changes or lead to<br>brain changes sorry about the<br>extra word there that will improve your<br>mental functioning generally so they<br>should have carry over to other mental<br>tasks that you're doing for example<br>concentration at work<br>and that they should protect against any<br>age-related cognitive decline and that<br>they may even protect you against early<br>onset dementia<br>all right let's look at whether those<br>claims which are quite bold actually pan<br>out<br>all right there was a study done<br>recently<br>published in psychological science in<br>the public interest this was in 19 sorry<br>2016.<br>and the study it took a big long look at<br>various other studies that had examined<br>whether these games are effective<br>for the things they claim that is do<br>they have carryover to other cognitive<br>skills do they improve your<br>concentration generally and so forth and<br>also do they stave off old age<br>cognitive related<br>decline the answers were disappointing<br>so<br>what they found in these studies was<br>that first of all although they claim to<br>be based on the latest neuroscience<br>there isn't a lot of neuroscience in the<br>games the games are largely drawn on<br>some very old tasks that we developed in<br>the cognitive neuropsychology literature<br>about 20 years ago before there was any<br>brain imaging at all so in fact the<br>claim that is based on the latest<br>neuroscience is kind of weak<br>it's more based on very old-fashioned<br>cognitive psychology ideas that we knew<br>long before the brain we knew much about<br>where in the brain things were going on<br>what about the claims that it actually<br>leads to changes in the way that we<br>think or the way our concentration level<br>and general skills they found that there<br>was<br>no benefit that went beyond the actual<br>games themselves so in other words<br>studies show that people who do these<br>games improve enormously on the games so<br>you get better at doing the games<br>there's no question about that<br>but there's very little evidence that<br>those benefits generalize to anywhere<br>else where you might want them for<br>example concentrating at work<br>so<br>that claim certainly was not fulfilled<br>by the studies<br>second bigger claim and one of the huge<br>selling points of these<br>programs is that they may protect<br>against that age-related decline<br>no there's no evidence that they have<br>any protective effect over and above any<br>other activity that people would engage<br>in as older adults<br>and in fact they probably have less<br>beneficial effect than starting a<br>regular walking schedule so walking once<br>a day would have more of a benefit on<br>your overall cognitive health as an<br>older individual than would spending<br>that same amount of time doing those<br>training gains<br>so<br>the reality really isn't panning out as<br>it should and a couple of years ago um<br>people took lumosity to court for their<br>poor advertising and they were forced to<br>actually um<br>hike back from their original claims and<br>make much more modest claims but yet<br>there's still it's quite a big business<br>and they're making a lot of money out of<br>these promises that there will be these<br>various neuroscience inspired benefits<br>all right so<br>a little disappointing<br>now promised you a road map that you<br>could use or that you could apply sort<br>of logic you could apply when you're<br>looking at these sorts of claims for<br>yourself<br>and in my roadmap i've suggested that<br>you look at four things when you're<br>deciding whether some sort of<br>neuroscience claim is valid or not<br>the first thing you want to ask yourself<br>is you know does the author have a dog<br>in the fight so is there some financial<br>benefit associated with whatever it is<br>they're selling<br>or does it promote some belief system<br>that the person is heavily invested in<br>um okay so we've already seen in our<br>example we've got you know quite a lot<br>of financial incentive involved in<br>making these claims big big money<br>all right so we've already failed here<br>on the first one<br>so according to my roadmap<br>if you fail on the first one you do have<br>an investment then you should be<br>treating everything from there on with<br>caution<br>we should be thinking very carefully<br>about what is in it for the author<br>if we went further which we don't have<br>to according to this map because we've<br>already reached the point where we have<br>to treat with caution but if we were to<br>go further and look at the next few<br>steps this<br>this claim also fails on the next two<br>criteria as well so the next criterion<br>is<br>could we explain the key ideas<br>underlying the training without<br>mentioning the brain itself<br>and the answer is we could because<br>there's actually nothing about the<br>actual physical brain<br>involved in this proposal or in any of<br>these games they're based off<br>tasks that we've developed in the<br>cognitive psychology literature many<br>many decades ago before we knew much<br>about what areas of the brain were<br>involved at all so it fails on that<br>second criteria too there's no need to<br>mention or bring in the brain the brain<br>is not adding anything at all to the<br>claims or the arguments that these<br>authors are making<br>okay let's look at the third criterion<br>the third step in the roadmap<br>does the evidence sound good at first<br>but amount to nothing i think we've got<br>a yes here too okay so studies that have<br>actually tried to test whether people<br>are actually<br>showing any benefits<br>from these training games<br>that go beyond the training games<br>themselves have found in the negative so<br>it's failed on all those<br>the fourth criterion doesn't confuse<br>cause and effect doesn't come into play<br>here we've failed on the top three we're<br>out of the game with this one<br>okay<br>fail for the first and you know just to<br>to let you know in advance you know this<br>is not a positive talk<br>i'm going to be taking a very skeptical<br>view on some of these plans all right<br>here's our next one<br>eight weeks of mindfulness training will<br>change your brain<br>okay this was going around a few years<br>ago about two years ago there was a lot<br>of headlines in the paper study had<br>announced that mindfulness training<br>increased the gray matter volume in your<br>brain<br>and even as little as eight weeks of<br>successful mindfulness training could<br>improve brave amount of volume in your<br>hippocampus which is a part of the brain<br>which is very important for encoding<br>memories<br>all right let's have a look at it okay<br>so sorry this one is a little bit older<br>than that it's one of the very early<br>studies 2011. okay came up in psychiatry<br>research neuroimaging mindfulness<br>practice leads to increases in regional<br>gray matter density looks good it's in<br>it properly<br>validated journal this is a decent<br>journal<br>so what do they mean by this what is<br>gray matter density well grey meta<br>density is<br>something that we measure by looking at<br>brain scans and it's a rough indicator<br>of how thick the cortex is in various<br>areas of the brain so when the measure<br>is high that means we've got quite rich<br>a lot of nuclei a lot of cortex in that<br>area which tends to be considered to be<br>good for increased capacity so gray<br>matter density is a rough measure of<br>thickness of the cortex if you like<br>all right let's have a look at<br>what the study found okay<br>so the study found that if you did eight<br>weeks of successful mindfulness training<br>and you adhered to the program that<br>participants who had adhered to that<br>program showed increases in gray matter<br>volume in the left hippocampus which is<br>a region that we know is involved in<br>memory and this was compared to a group<br>that did relaxation therapy instead of<br>mindfulness which didn't so they were<br>comparing one group with another who'd<br>had a different kind of training that<br>didn't involve mindfulness<br>i'm just going to see if i can just uh<br>zip out there and show you um<br>the uh<br>area of the brain that they found to be<br>can you still see<br>edvic<br>all right there's a really lovely<br>visualization of the brain here that you<br>can see at any time at brain facts<br>dot org<br>now let me show you the hippocampus so<br>if you can see there we've got a image<br>of the brain lovely 3d image of the<br>brain it's got the two hemispheres we're<br>looking at there at the left hemisphere<br>down here we have the cerebellum which<br>is important for motor control<br>if we turn it around it's the right<br>hemisphere and as many of you will know<br>brain's made up of two hemispheres so<br>they're almost completely separate<br>except connected at the base of the<br>cerebral cortex<br>now let me show you where the<br>hippocampus in it's a structure that<br>lies deep inside the cerebral<br>hemispheres which you can't see from the<br>outside i'm just going to zoom in on it<br>there<br>there it is there it's a tiny lip of<br>cortex that is tucked right inside the<br>temporal lobes and we have one on either<br>side<br>this part of the brain is really<br>important for memory and it has some<br>very special properties that make it<br>very good for acquiring memories rapidly<br>so they can it can code information just<br>from one experience so it's the area of<br>the brain that allows you to remember a<br>particular event and just from the one<br>experience of that event<br>all right let's go back to the slide<br>that's the hippocampus this is the area<br>that these<br>researchers<br>found was increased in volume after the<br>mindfulness training now this is looking<br>pretty good so far isn't it you're<br>thinking you know what is caroline going<br>to do with this this is looking fairly<br>convincing<br>okay so they found this increase a small<br>increase in gray matter volume in the<br>left hippocampus<br>they found there was some increases in<br>other areas too but those increases were<br>small and they weren't statistically<br>reliable so it's not clear for sure<br>whether or not those differences were<br>reliable<br>they didn't look at any areas that might<br>have shown a reduction in gray matter<br>density so they only focused on<br>increases<br>all right so<br>well one of the problems is that<br>everything we do changes the brain and<br>mindfulness training is no exception<br>so the fact that something some major<br>change that you make to your lifestyle<br>over the course of eight weeks the fact<br>that that changes your brain structure<br>is no surprise to anyone if you decided<br>to spend eight weeks sitting and binge<br>watching netflix you would also show<br>changes in your gray matter volume in<br>your brain too so any significant change<br>to your lifestyle is going to be coded<br>in your brain and this is going to be<br>measurable in terms of changes to gray<br>matter density so there's nothing really<br>special or amazing about the fact that<br>people changing their practices is also<br>changing their great matter density<br>and we know that the hippocampus is one<br>of the areas of the brain that responds<br>very rapidly to new experiences so if<br>we're going to see change anywhere this<br>is where we're going to see it<br>so that's not much of a surprise either<br>another problem with this area is that<br>the brain's changing in all kinds of<br>ways all the time in fact with every<br>single thing that you do when you finish<br>this lecture your brain will be slightly<br>different from when you began<br>so some of those changes will be<br>positive you'll increase gray matter<br>volume in some areas others will be<br>negative and and the two go together you<br>can't have one without the other<br>um in these studies they focus only on<br>the positive changes and you're going to<br>get some of those whatever you compare<br>anything with you'll be able to find<br>some evidence of positive changes so<br>there's too many opportunities for false<br>positives in this sort of research for<br>us to be really sure<br>that this is a reliable<br>improvement in our brain activity<br>but there's something even bigger even<br>more problematic with this area and it's<br>something to do with this idea that the<br>brain has anything to do<br>with what is good for us or what makes<br>us feel better<br>the brain really cannot make any<br>judgments<br>about what is better for you every<br>activity no matter how negative no<br>matter how positive will result in<br>volume changes in your brain some of<br>them will be increases in gray matter<br>density some of them will be decreases<br>the brain cannot distinguish we can't<br>tell by looking at what area of the<br>brain has changed whether the change is<br>good or not that valence that value that<br>you put on as a human being<br>has to be judged by you in terms of<br>improvement in your functioning and your<br>outlook on life and your level of<br>relaxation and your enjoyment and so so<br>on so forth<br>so again when we start to really unpack<br>this we see that not only is the<br>evidence a little bit shaky for this<br>sort of idea that the brain is benefits<br>in some way from mindfulness training<br>but also when we come down to it we<br>realize that the brain really<br>that doesn't have a say in this it<br>doesn't have anything useful to add to<br>whether or not we find this practice<br>beneficial so i'm in no way saying that<br>mindfulness training is not helpful or<br>was not a good thing to do i'm simply<br>saying that we should keep the god damn<br>brain out of it<br>all right so let's go back to the road<br>map okay sorry so the first<br>criterion does the claim support some<br>financial interest or strongly held<br>belief system well i think i would say a<br>yes for that one<br>because<br>there's a very strong there's a lot of<br>interests aligned with mindfulness<br>meditation therapy a lot of people are<br>interested in it so it doesn't<br>necessarily mean that people have to<br>have a direct financial connection to it<br>there's a lot of strong belief in the<br>benefits of this people motivated to<br>show that it's beneficial<br>now i think that's great and they should<br>continue to show that it's beneficial<br>but they should just not do it by using<br>when we go down to the next criterion<br>could we explain the idea without<br>mentioning the brain<br>no we probably couldn't explain the<br>claim they're making without mentioning<br>the brain the claim is about the brain<br>but really it's a diversion from what we<br>really care about isn't it in<br>mindfulness<br>meditation we don't really care about<br>how the brain is changing we care about<br>how our outlook is changing how our<br>attitude is changing how our coping<br>skills are changing and so forth<br>so that one will be a no for that<br>third one does the evidence sound good<br>at first but amount to nothing that is a<br>yes<br>so definitely that one we are looking at<br>evidence that when you break it down<br>starts to look very shaky indeed you<br>could find whatever activity you did if<br>you changed it for<br>changed your activities for enough time<br>eight weeks systematically you would<br>find some positive changes in the brain<br>if you looked so that one is a little<br>bit stronger the evidence than than<br>actually<br>well it appears stronger than it<br>actually is<br>doesn't confuse cause and effect i'm<br>going to go on the next explanation<br>which is going to look at cause and<br>effect but we've got to treat with<br>caution again i'm sorry it's a very<br>skeptical look at the brain so far isn't<br>it<br>all right so we've had two different<br>studies now and they're probably going<br>up in difficulty for you so you could<br>probably see right away what the problem<br>was with the brain training games but<br>perhaps with the mindfulness meditation<br>it takes a little bit more to sort of<br>unpack what the actual claim is and<br>whether it's true<br>now let's have a look at the third claim<br>which is about psychopathy and this one<br>has had quite a lot of in influence on<br>the way that people think about crime<br>and also about<br>abnormal behavior more generally<br>let me show you what the claim is<br>so this was one of the headlines that<br>came out when this claim was first<br>announced about 10 years ago now science<br>daily said there's a neurological basis<br>for the lack of empathy and psychopaths<br>that's psychopathy some headlines said<br>psychopathy is due to a brain disease<br>it's not their fault psychopaths have a<br>brain disease<br>all right so what did the study involve<br>it involved putting people in an fmri<br>scanner which is like a full body<br>scanner some of you might have<br>experienced this<br>and you're put in and then you're given<br>various tasks to do and the scanner is<br>able to detect<br>information about the blood the oxygen<br>that your blood is using up as you do<br>the task so areas that are very involved<br>in the task you're doing will be taking<br>up more oxygen from your blood than<br>areas that aren't so we can get a little<br>map of the areas that are most actively<br>engaged in the tasks that we're using<br>okay so what they did is they<br>put various people into these scanners<br>they they used people that scored high<br>on a questionnaire that asked about<br>psychopathic behaviors for example you<br>know how much do i<br>feel um<br>bad when people around me are sad those<br>sorts of things so they looked at a<br>group that scored quite high on the<br>psychopath that is they weren't affected<br>by other people's emotions they<br>they they reported that they didn't<br>experience a lot of empathy and they<br>also looked at another group that scored<br>low in that measure so that was their<br>control group so they were comparing<br>a psychopath group if you like with um a<br>healthy control group<br>okay so in the scanner what the<br>participants were asked to do was<br>looking it was to look at various<br>pictures and there were a mix of<br>pictures but the key pictures were kind<br>of distressing gory pictures of people<br>with wounds or people who had been in<br>natural disasters and so forth<br>and there were two conditions in one<br>condition people were asked to imagine<br>that<br>that experience was happening to someone<br>else so imagine what it would be like<br>what would it be like for that person to<br>have that injury or to have experienced<br>that accident or that event<br>and there was a second condition where<br>people were asked to imagine it<br>happening to yourself so imagine that<br>had happened to you think about that<br>think about how you would feel<br>if you were in that situation and you<br>had just sustained that injury okay and<br>they were interested in whether people<br>would show different brain activity<br>depending on whether they were thinking<br>about themselves or whether they were<br>imagining it happening to somebody else<br>so you can see how this is relevant to<br>psychopathy<br>okay here's what they found so we're<br>interested<br>uh in an area in the brain called the<br>amygdala which is highly activated when<br>we're in a highly aroused mode uh<br>emotional state<br>um so when we're experiencing you know a<br>lot of fear or anxiety or especially a<br>lot of negative emotion there's a lot of<br>activation in the amygdala and we're<br>looking here at the right amygdala in<br>particular<br>all right so if people are experiencing<br>a lot of emotion a lot of empathy for<br>the people in the pictures they're<br>likely to show<br>high emotional arousal which should be<br>indexed by activity in this area of the<br>brain<br>so what i'm going to show you there on<br>the<br>right hand side is what the data showed<br>so do you remember there were the two<br>conditions there was a condition where<br>people had to imagine the thing was<br>happening to themselves<br>and then they had to imagine what it<br>would be like it was happening to<br>somebody else<br>and you can see we've got the two groups<br>we've got the people in green here are<br>the psychopaths the people who scored<br>high on the psychopath scale and we've<br>got the uh brown group who were<br>i'm sorry the other way around the green<br>group and scored low on the psychopath<br>scale and the brown group scored high<br>alright so you see they didn't differ<br>much when they were asked to imagine it<br>happening to themselves so both groups<br>felt emotionally aroused when they<br>imagined what it would be like to have<br>the injury or to experience the disaster<br>that was in the picture<br>that's what you would expect right um<br>these people don't lack emotion in<br>general<br>however when they were asked to imagine<br>it happening to some someone else this<br>is where they saw the difference so the<br>psychopaths showed reduced activation in<br>this amygdala area when compared to the<br>non-psychopaths the people who scored<br>low on the scale<br>suggesting that there was something<br>different about the way their brain was<br>responding to<br>the<br>task of imagining the distress of<br>someone else<br>okay so what do you think<br>do you think this data<br>supports the idea that psychopaths have<br>in a way it does doesn't it certainly<br>shows you that there is something to be<br>detected in their brains which is<br>abnormal<br>but what we don't know from this<br>evidence is whether or not that is the<br>cause of their problem or whether it's<br>just another manifestation of it so just<br>let me walk you through that briefly<br>so the problem is all right we know that<br>this area of the brain the amygdala is<br>involved in the processing of emotion<br>right<br>now we know that if you're not<br>emotionally aroused by something you<br>don't feel moved by something you won't<br>show a lot of activation in that area<br>right<br>we also know that<br>the definition of the condition is that<br>these are people that aren't incredibly<br>moved by the distress of others<br>so what would we expect to see on a<br>brain scan if we ask them to imagine<br>other people being in distress we would<br>not expect to see much activation in the<br>amygdala<br>so in other words<br>it's not the brain causing the effect<br>this is just another way of<br>demonstrating what we already know<br>because this is how we've defined the<br>condition it's a lack of emotion in<br>response to imagining another person's<br>distress<br>so the problem here is one in<br>of cause and effect isn't it we have to<br>be very careful when we're dealing with<br>brain data not to imagine that somehow<br>the brain data is privileged in some<br>causal way that that it somehow<br>underpins everything it's the reason<br>it's just this activation is probably<br>just another manifestation of the<br>problem<br>and it certainly in no way gets people<br>off the hook if they've committed crimes<br>this is not<br>a brain illness that diminishes your<br>responsibility in any way it's just a<br>phenomenon<br>so looking back at our road map okay so<br>we have the first question does the<br>claim support some financial interest or<br>strongly held belief system well i guess<br>no in this case there's nobody who's<br>really<br>bent over backwards trying to sell the<br>idea that psychopaths are<br>uh<br>brain<br>disordered people<br>could we explain the idea without<br>mentioning the brain probably not it<br>really does reference genuine brain<br>evidence genuine findings that we would<br>not have if we hadn't studied the brain<br>what about the next one does the<br>evidence sound good at first but amount<br>it doesn't amount to nothing does it but<br>it's not really showing<br>some sort of causal process it's not<br>really doing the work that some people<br>have claimed so if we go down to the<br>last one this is where this one fails<br>so does the evidence confuse cause and<br>effect<br>it does doesn't it so we have a<br>phenomenon we have a reading from<br>someone's brain this does not mean that<br>it causes their behavior it's another<br>way of demonstrating the behavior itself<br>so we come again to as i said with my<br>very skeptical view treat with caution<br>all right so i've shown you three<br>examples of neuroscience evidence that<br>vary in how difficult or it<br>blows up how easy they are to explain or<br>to unpack and i've shown you that each<br>of them fails for kind of different<br>reasons<br>and so i'm hoping that what you'll take<br>away from this talk is a sense that you<br>need to be very skeptical<br>remember that there's an incredible<br>seductive allure to brain explanations<br>and that people are drawing in the brain<br>to support all sorts of claims where it<br>doesn't belong<br>and even those studies that do actually<br>reference and use data from the brain<br>may be interpreting maybe way over<br>interpreting the data so my main message<br>is caveat emptor be careful don't be<br>distracted if a claim in front of you<br>whether it's a claim in education or law<br>has<br>some reference to neuroscience evidence<br>that's probably almost<br>certainly a distraction<br>in about 95 percent cases it's a<br>distraction<br>i say be skeptical some people would say<br>oh well a lot of these things are<br>harmless what's what's a little bit of<br>brain training people like to do it good<br>on them<br>mindfulness meditation nobody could<br>argue with that that's a great thing to<br>do so<br>why not just go along with it<br>so but my argument would be that you<br>need to be skeptical because sometimes<br>these ideas can be harmful and by<br>believing in things that are actually<br>not evidence-based we can this can lead<br>to harm and it also can lead to a<br>much lightened wallet when it comes to<br>things like mindfulness meditation and<br>also brain training so i think there's a<br>really good reason to be skeptical here<br>and not just be open to all claims that<br>people are making<br>and i saw it's a bit of a freudian slip<br>here it shouldn't say god to be true it<br>should say good to be true<br>i think the general rule here is that if<br>it's too good to be true it probably<br>isn't true<br>all right thank you very much<br>uh questions comments conversation<br>great thank you very much carolyn thank<br>you<br>yes<br>super interesting um i think it's a very<br>helpful guidance uh that guide that you<br>put together with the roadmap that's<br>really really cool<br>um<br>yeah so there are a couple of questions<br>to you so one of them is actually um<br>i'm not sure how much it is a question<br>but somebody was mentioning that<br>um they have seen a work on cognitive<br>bias where the participants get given<br>three numbers like 3 6 and 12 and the<br>participants had to give three numbers<br>back<br>something like 24 48 minus six and had<br>to give the theory which the<br>participants said the numbers doubled so<br>they they could give one to three and be<br>right the actually<br>theory was the numbers go up in<br>ascending order and it took a while for<br>participants to figure out the answer<br>and they would try and argue the point<br>and so apparently that's from this<br>black swan white swan book<br>ah yeah<br>um yeah another another one slightly<br>older if people are interested in biases<br>is the dan kahneman book thinking fast<br>and slow which talks about some of the<br>other biases that we engage in when we<br>make rapid judgments about various<br>situations uh it doesn't mention the<br>brain at all really um because most of<br>this research like like that example<br>that hedrick just shared with us<br>is purely done at a at a cognitive level<br>we don't actually look at the brain<br>areas engaged but there's lots of<br>evidence that we make um judgment that<br>sure that falls short of<br>full accuracy in a lot of situations and<br>that's another i think spring series<br>talk for another day talking about the<br>ways in which we sometimes fail to be<br>completely logical in our various um<br>ways we judge things that's a good point<br>yeah nice follow-up from um<br>from the last one on conspiracy theories<br>i think that was my my second choice if<br>you remember rightly was wanting to talk<br>about that at the spring series you know<br>how we think and make judgments so next<br>time yeah<br>uh and then there's another one<br>where somebody asks or says<br>that they are glad that you mentioned<br>that going for a daily walk would be<br>more beneficial than brain games and<br>they read a book that suggests that many<br>of the key attributes of human humans<br>relates to our development as walking<br>creatures so that that means that<br>walking actually improves brain function<br>and what do you think about that oh yeah<br>there's actually a really strong body of<br>evidence now to show that you know<br>getting even elderly people engaged in<br>activity programs can show measurable<br>benefits in their cognition and it's a<br>much stronger and more powerful effect<br>than any of these brain training games<br>and there's a there's a lot of reasons<br>why this might be the case um so for<br>example you know increased<br>cardiovascular efficiency will also<br>increase flow to the brain which will<br>improve your efficiency it may also have<br>other benefits for example if it<br>improves your sleep that will improve<br>um your general cognitive function as<br>well<br>we need to be a little bit careful of<br>some of the literature because some of<br>the literature on exercise and its<br>benefits for cognition<br>is descriptive so it talks about people<br>who do exercise already<br>and they tend to show uh they perform<br>more rapidly and more effectively on<br>some cognitive tasks but of course there<br>may be a reason why certain people<br>aren't active that also affects their<br>cognition so we need to be a little bit<br>careful when we're looking at studies<br>that just describe what people are<br>already doing there could be a lot of<br>reasons why people aren't engaging in<br>activity that also could be affecting<br>their cognition<br>but there are now quite a lot of<br>intervention studies that have actually<br>looked at exercise programs in<br>previously sedentary people and shown<br>that they lead to benefits and those<br>benefits are both proximate so they can<br>occur within the 24 hours after the<br>activity but they're also<br>more extended so you can see benefits<br>outside the period associated with the<br>activity as well for some months<br>so definitely a good thing and better<br>than spending your money on brain<br>great thank you um then there's another<br>question that asks in a similar vein or<br>basically on other alternative practices<br>for example would living with faith<br>practice help maintaining healthy brains<br>absolutely and i think that if you were<br>to do a study like this with any sort of<br>program like that if the program aligned<br>with the person's<br>needs and that they felt good about it<br>you would see something in the brain<br>so my point here isn't that there's uh<br>you know any special privilege for<br>mindfulness meditation or any program<br>probably if those programs make you feel<br>more efficient and calmer<br>that's all you need to know that's my<br>point um<br>and yes there isn't a lot of evidence<br>to distinguish between different<br>interventions so in general when we look<br>at psychological interventions and their<br>effectiveness so for example we look at<br>cbt or we look at acceptance and<br>commitment therapy or mindfulness or<br>whatever it is<br>most of those things show some benefit<br>and it's often very difficult to tell<br>which is better than the other so<br>they'll often show similar benefits<br>there's not a lot of evidence that<br>privileges any<br>specific psychological intervention over<br>any other one at the moment<br>um so you know whatever is most aligned<br>with your outlook will be most effective<br>for you<br>there are a couple more questions around<br>that affect what actually would happen<br>in the brain with for example something<br>like mindfulness training so one is um<br>for example that they hear lots of<br>people saying that doing certain things<br>like mindfulness would strengthen neural<br>pathways and if you could comment on<br>that<br>okay well that is true but then watching<br>binge watching netflix will also<br>strengthen neural pathways um uh so we<br>can't tell just from looking at the way<br>an activity changes your brain whether<br>that's a positive or a negative thing<br>and that's my point we're not yet at the<br>at the stage of being able to look into<br>the brain and be able to tell from what<br>we see there whether it's a good or a<br>bad thing<br>um so yes you'll get pathways<br>strengthening by changing your activity<br>in some systematic way whether it's you<br>know whether you're starting on a crime<br>spree or a netflix binge or whether<br>you're doing something positive with<br>yourself like mindfulness meditation<br>uh so we're just not in a position to<br>tell from the brain whether those<br>changes are good or bad um yeah yeah<br>makes sense<br>um and there's another question around<br>um<br>um the psychopathy topic um if an infant<br>is expected to be so that infants are<br>basically expected to be self-centered<br>and if there have been developmental<br>studies on whether psychopathy is a kind<br>of deficiency in the development or<br>learning of empathy<br>i'm going to hand this one back to<br>hedvik because she's much more of an<br>expert in psychopathy than i am edward<br>would you like to answer that for us<br>well i might potentially say a little<br>bit about that that is actually true<br>yeah we do see that in children who<br>early on that already difference though<br>so it's not about only about being<br>self-centered it's not only about being<br>uh taking care of your own needs it's<br>really also about um<br>less being less emotional being less<br>perspective taking from an early age<br>children from an early age are able to<br>do these things and to to feel empathy<br>and we<br>can actually see in their studies that<br>show that children who have some sort of<br>precursors of psychopathic personality<br>traits they do show differences in the<br>way they behave and that is um<br>linked to something<br>is described as unemotional uncaring<br>about others<br>so there is a developmental pathway to<br>that yeah<br>but<br>you wouldn't be claiming that<br>necessarily psychopathy is purely<br>genetic that that you know that the<br>child that could also be an<br>environmental influence right yeah no<br>definitely actually so it's not the<br>environment as well as it doesn't<br>necessarily mean that it's hardwired<br>into your brain from birth<br>exactly and we can also see that some of<br>those children might show this type of<br>unemotionality when they're young<br>they lose that over time and they<br>actually develop an emotional um<br>engagement and empathy over time so it's<br>also not necessarily aesthetic thing<br>even no matter if it's genetic or not<br>like the genetic components but also in<br>addition later on that can disappear so<br>um there's a lot of there's a multitude<br>of factors that contribute to this<br>development yeah<br>um then there was somebody asking in the<br>first study you mentioned you said that<br>there was a range of researchers from<br>new to experience did they ex the<br>experienced researchers make better<br>judgment calls than the one the new ones<br>okay so they tested first-year<br>psychology students who showed a really<br>strong seductive ally they were really<br>really taken by the neuroscience<br>explanations they also tested a third<br>year group which also showed a slightly<br>reduced<br>effect and they tested researchers that<br>worked in the neuroscience area and the<br>researchers weren't seduced by the<br>effects but you know these are people<br>that have probably been working in the<br>era for at least maybe 10 20 years<br>um so we're still you know even after<br>quite considerable training we can still<br>fall for these things<br>um it's something that we need to be<br>constantly looking out for<br>it's kind of a susceptibility of humans<br>i think to<br>you know there's something concrete<br>about the brain that attracts us too<br>isn't there you can see it and touch it<br>and feel it because people are talking<br>about emotions or thoughts or cognitions<br>these things are so kind of<br>abstract the brain is quite you know<br>it's quite and there's something quite<br>seductive about um reducing<br>you know our experience to something<br>physical um a set of physical states<br>um kind of related to this and earlier<br>questions one<br>person also asks if there are if there's<br>actually something<br>about certain cells in the brain if if<br>there's a if that is if there's a<br>meaning to activations in certain cells<br>or if um<br>or if it's more rather about areas and<br>if certain areas in the brain can be<br>related to certain<br>parts of thinking or to certain types of<br>mind<br>okay this is one thing i wanted to talk<br>about but didn't think i'd have enough<br>time today i wanted to give you um an<br>example of something positive that we<br>can learn from the brain<br>about you know how we think and and<br>there are certain types of cells in the<br>brain certain regions of the brain that<br>have concentrations of cells that do<br>very specific things<br>so for example i showed you the area of<br>the hippocampus which is right tucked<br>inside the two temporal lobes there and<br>that has a very sort of very special<br>cell structure that makes it optimized<br>for<br>learning rapidly and we need to be able<br>to learn rapidly if we're going to<br>remember what we just did so that's the<br>kind of learning where you only have one<br>chance to learn it's by definition when<br>you you can only do something once<br>um and these cells are optimized for<br>that kind of rapid learning and there<br>are other cells around that area outside<br>of hippocampus which are more<br>specialized for slower learning so we we<br>have a few like um different cell<br>structures that are attuned to picking<br>up different kinds of information and<br>it's this this balance that we achieve<br>that allows us to not only remember<br>yesterday but also to have to build a<br>general knowledge that's robust that's<br>accumulated over our whole lifetimes<br>and you know people say<br>you know why are we so<br>why is our memory so fallible why are we<br>always forgetting things and my answer<br>to that is that we are designed to do<br>that so we're designed to remember<br>generalities most of the time that's<br>what's most important to humans<br>and we so we need just very small<br>dedicated areas for remembering events<br>and large areas of cortex<br>dedicated for<br>to remembering generality so yes the<br>area in the brain matters a lot and<br>different areas are coded differently to<br>great thank you<br>and then there's another question around<br>responsibility so there's coming back a<br>little bit to this question that uh in<br>the psychopathy context was uh coming up<br>uh but do people<br>uh at what point uh do people cease to<br>be responsible for the action is there a<br>clear division point or given that we<br>are all the products of our nature or<br>and our nurture<br>is that actually possible to answer the<br>question<br>well again this is one i might want to<br>refer back to hepwig because she is much<br>more expert in criminal matters than i<br>am i mean my view is that the question<br>of causation is kind of orthogonal to<br>responsibility i mean you can know why<br>somebody you know the terrible life<br>circumstances that led them to commit a<br>crime but that doesn't necessarily mean<br>that we would do not want to invoke<br>punishment for that crime but havoc<br>please you take it from me because<br>um yeah<br>it's a very good question and kind of<br>links up back what you said what you<br>said earlier that basically anything we<br>do has an impact on the brain right so<br>it's i kind of it's kind of really<br>difficult to say like this is due to the<br>brain and then it's not due to something<br>else anything that we do and if we do it<br>intentionally is coming in some ways<br>from the brain so we kind of like<br>disentangle the brain from the rest of<br>us and what we're doing it's just like<br>in bed that's it's that's us<br>and um and so in that sense you could<br>always say uh it's it's the brain who<br>did it well it's for anything that we do<br>so in that sense you can really not say<br>like there's<br>a barrier and where does it stop that<br>somebody's responsible or not<br>um and that's a very tricky question and<br>then people people struggle with that a<br>lot and and the law tries to come up<br>with some sort of ideas and then use a<br>psychopathology as soon as it is some<br>sort of disorder that has been defined<br>as disorder<br>then somebody has less responsibility<br>potentially<br>uh you could also say some in some ways<br>how people were<br>the experiences that they had throughout<br>their lives<br>which is not their responsibility in<br>some ways either sometimes sometimes<br>they have no choice<br>brought them to where they are and where<br>their brain is currently and so for that<br>reason they can sometimes behave behave<br>for that in that way that they behave so<br>i think it's a really really tricky<br>question um and i think<br>a better way to to address this is<br>rather than asking why they're doing it<br>and if they're responsible not is better<br>asking what do they need what is the<br>thing that they what they would help<br>them<br>to behave differently in the future<br>rather than asking if that makes them<br>more or less responsible<br>yeah i think again it's this thing we<br>have about brain data which we somehow<br>a kind of privilege of other kinds of<br>data so we've we've known for decades<br>that<br>you know crime doesn't occur<br>largely it doesn't occur in a vacuum<br>people that commit crimes often have a<br>background where they've you know had<br>all sorts of terrible events occurred in<br>their lives and we've known that for<br>many many decades and so just<br>discovering the brain areas that are<br>involved really isn't it doesn't<br>contribute anything new we we know<br>um that there's you know a mixture of of<br>causal factors that go into crime it's<br>so that the question of responsibility<br>has always been a complex one<br>and the discovery of brain science does<br>not change that that that those moral<br>equations in any way we still have to<br>probability yeah yeah<br>and that's probably related to this um<br>question so what can we actually still<br>learn from the research or from from<br>studying the brain so<br>should we take away now from this that<br>we don't really need to study the brain<br>because<br>absolutely not<br>and i thought it would be too much for<br>this talk but uh perhaps i'll return for<br>another spring series talk and talk<br>about the wonderful things that we can<br>learn from the brain<br>and of course this is my area of<br>specialty and i believe that we can<br>learn a lot<br>about the way our memories are formed<br>about the way in which we make judgments<br>the way we think we how we make<br>decisions by looking at the structures<br>that support those things and we can be<br>informed so we can create<br>better theories of how people think and<br>how people behave and and how they<br>remember and i think that knowing these<br>things changes the way that you view<br>human human beings and human behavior in<br>a really profound way<br>so definitely there's lots for another<br>talk there on the positive that we can<br>learn from neuroscience<br>without getting too distracted by the<br>bells and whistles<br>so when you if you would give people a<br>recommendation now coming from this<br>about how to<br>how to deal with the buzzword brain and<br>you have your roadmap and um to be<br>mostly mainly be careful in the first<br>place be careful<br>yes so um<br>do you think like uh just ignoring brain<br>mentions of brain um brain activity<br>brain<br>being the brain being trained or<br>anything altogether or how should people<br>deal with that and<br>above and beyond your road map<br>sometimes it might be hard to actually<br>figure these things out that you just<br>meant that you mentioned there okay so<br>yes my advice would be probably to<br>ignore it<br>um unless you unless you can invest the<br>time that would be required to tease it<br>apart i think the danger is that if<br>somebody's providing with brain<br>information they're probably trying to<br>mislead you i do think that's the case<br>so<br>see it imagine what would happen if you<br>took that information out would you find<br>the argument or the claim as convincing<br>that's a really good test of whether<br>it's a good claim<br>um<br>so very wary indeed of<br>headlines or claims or arguments that<br>okay<br>um i'm just keeping an eye if there's<br>any questions still please put them into<br>the q a box<br>um during that while we're looking for<br>that um<br>i find it quite interesting last week we<br>were talking about how<br>conspiracy theories<br>are the the the the likelihood that<br>somebody's um<br>believing into conspiracy theories or is<br>a conspiracy theorist<br>um is much related and explained by<br>how much people actually believe in<br>science altogether<br>so i was wondering about your thoughts<br>around so how should<br>brain scientists communicate their brain<br>findings in a way that<br>they're i on the one hand side not like<br>not wrong or can be not misinterpreted<br>uh but on the other hand side also make<br>that's difficult i mean in that<br>situation we've almost got the opposite<br>haven't we so we've gotten a lot of um a<br>lot of expertise we have skepticism in<br>in audiences about experts proclaiming<br>you know whether we should be vaccinated<br>or and there's a lot of skepticism about<br>these things but in this area of<br>neuroscience we often have the opposite<br>we have a lot of<br>people who are a lot of credulity<br>um so we have the opposite problem and<br>these these things are just naturally<br>seductive<br>so i don't think this uh the suspicion<br>of experts thing is is such a concern in<br>the neuroscience area it's it's more the<br>opposite being<br>misled by science and it's difficult<br>because often the science is out of the<br>control of the scientists by the time it<br>reaches you it's it's in the control of<br>people who are creating a product<br>whether it's brain training whatever<br>or it's in the control of the media who<br>are looking for the sexiest next thing<br>to tell you that psychopathy is in your<br>brain or whatever it is<br>um so it's difficult for scientists to<br>keep control of that of the narrative<br>when it comes to neuroscience and it<br>gets it gets ahead of them very quickly<br>i think<br>yeah<br>um there's another question um do you<br>think brain data is successful at<br>validating people's lived experiences<br>with depression and anxiety<br>it's a really good question and this is<br>one that i'm very interested in<br>um<br>so i mentioned before that what we know<br>about the brain now is not enough for us<br>to be able to look at what you for<br>example look at a scan of somebody's<br>brain activating and know whether or not<br>they're depressed we don't have that<br>kind of fine grained detail to be able<br>to infer<br>from the brain scan what the person is<br>doing psychologically or thinking or<br>feeling<br>so we're not at that level but<br>what is really promising about<br>neuroscience in the area of<br>psychopathology in general is that we<br>can start to look at the signatures of<br>different psychological problems so for<br>example in depression there's often a<br>signature there's a there's a there's a<br>there's a network of structures that<br>seems to talk to itself quite a lot in<br>people with a depression<br>that doesn't tell us really a lot about<br>what the depression is but it gives us a<br>marker which may help us to further down<br>the line to tease apart different forms<br>of depression for example might be able<br>to divide people's depression into<br>subtypes according to whether they show<br>these kinds of biomarkers if you like<br>so although we're<br>way away from being able to look at a<br>scan and say oh yes clearly that's this<br>is what's going wrong here this is what<br>the person is thinking or feeling that's<br>wrong we can still use it as a biomarker<br>which might promote better research into<br>it further down the line so i'm very<br>positive about its uses there but also<br>nervous about its misuse at the same<br>time<br>can imagine okay one quick last question<br>we're running um<br>out of time soon but um any advice for<br>the general public to reach<br>the true narratives of the brain science<br>use the road map<br>uh i would also say see whether the<br>argument makes sense if you took the<br>brain information out<br>and so that way you can see what work<br>it's doing so in a lot of the things<br>we've we've looked at it's not actually<br>doing any work at all so in the first<br>one when we talked about the<br>brain training games the brain was not<br>actually doing any of the work it's<br>cognitive tasks<br>so i think the question is take the<br>brain stuff out and see see whether the<br>idea still holds<br>see how much of the claim is based on<br>neuroscience and if a lot of it is<br>then i think we have some real concerns<br>because as you can see there's a lot of<br>claims at the moment being made on<br>neuroscience evidence that is quite<br>shaky when we look at it carefully so<br>caution<br>yeah okay great<br>that's amazing um i see a lot of thank<br>yous coming up in the in the<br>message box as well<br>um<br>this was really super informative and<br>very helpful uh i think to figure out<br>what to do with this information when<br>the brain buzzword is used and um yeah<br>it's very very informative thank you so<br>much be lovely to talk to everybody<br>hopefully in person next time<br>yes indeed yes indeed<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
