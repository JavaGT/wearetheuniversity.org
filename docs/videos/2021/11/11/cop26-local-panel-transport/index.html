discussing transport and climate<br>action within the waikato region<br>and we're focusing on local action and<br>what we can do um yeah to help<br>lower emissions within the waikato<br>i have the privilege of being on the<br>panel alongside many distinguished<br>people<br>next up we have um professor mike duke<br>from the university of waikato who's<br>going to talk to us about um<br>yeah how engineering and um<br>electric bikes and that sort of thing<br>will<br>um contribute to lower emissions over to<br>you mike thanks<br>kiara and thanks angela so yeah i'm an<br>engineer so um i've been working in<br>electric vehicles for about 25 years<br>starting with solar racing cars we used<br>to race these vehicles across australia<br>and all around the world and it was all<br>about um<br>uh<br>low emission efficient vehicles we then<br>sort of moved on to uh before electric<br>vehicles became mainstream we moved on<br>to<br>um<br>uh long-range commuter vehicles which is<br>sort of ideal for ideal for new zealand<br>and at the moment we're working on uh<br>hybrid ferries hybrid electric ferries<br>passenger ferries for new zealand and in<br>particular autonomous agricultural<br>electric and hybrid vehicles so quite<br>it's very much a techie background that<br>i'm bringing<br>but what's really interesting is when<br>i'm talking about electric vehicles is<br>that um they have been around for over<br>100 years and we're probably in what we<br>call the fifth ev period at the moment<br>and hopefully we've got to what we call<br>the tipping point where we're going to<br>see a lot more use of electric vehicles<br>and i'm not going to focus on hydrogen<br>um there's a there's a bit of a you know<br>hydrogen and a battery<br>um<br>and i'd say competition i'd say but i'm<br>going to focus on battery electric<br>vehicles in particular<br>and one of the reasons why we're seeing<br>some electric vehicles at the moment i<br>think pretty everyone's aware it's<br>actually the battery technology that the<br>lithium battery technology that's meant<br>that we can get rid of something called<br>range anxiety which is very important<br>for countries like new zealand<br>where you have vehicles now that can<br>have a range of 600 kilometers so if<br>you're traveling the long distances<br>between<br>um towns in new zealand you can do that<br>quite easily<br>and<br>now we also have fast charging options<br>up to 350<br>kilowatt charges 350 kilometer range and<br>you can charge you can within a 10<br>minute charge so the technology is the<br>thing that's made the electric vehicles<br>um<br>really work and actually in the last<br>couple of months 20 of all the vehicles<br>new vehicles sold in new zealand were um<br>at some sort of electric variant either<br>fully electric or hybrid<br>so it's looking good if you're into<br>electric vehicles<br>so and the other thing that's going to<br>be really good about them for new<br>zealand in particular is that the fact<br>that you can have a network of charging<br>stations all around new zealand you're<br>just not relying on going to a petrol<br>station you can have what we call a<br>distributed network which means you can<br>go to various places and charge up<br>uh and new zealand is 80 renewable uh<br>electricity so it means as we move to<br>electric vehicles we start charging from<br>renewable sources we're reducing our<br>emissions so potentially it looks really<br>good a few caveats we have to be wary of<br>is if you're if you're using an electric<br>vehicle then you could be uh trying to<br>go charge up somewhere<br>and<br>you know 350 kilowatts to charge up your<br>ev is an awful lot of power which you<br>just isn't going to be available<br>everywhere<br>an example we drove off one of our<br>electric vehicles<br>in 2011 from auckland to bluff and we<br>went ah let's go down through the<br>caitlins which is a beautiful part<br>of um<br>new zealand and there was no charging<br>when we stopped at a cafe to charge up<br>we basically switched off the cafe so<br>it's not perfect there's going to be a<br>lot of infrastructure to make it work<br>but the the real one that i think is a<br>disruptive technology that can have a<br>massive impact on our environment and<br>our emissions is e-bikes<br>so it's a disruptive technology that we<br>should embrace and but by taking the<br>lithium battery technology and putting<br>onto e-bikes we've suddenly created a<br>completely new and disruptive form of<br>transport which i have fully embraced my<br>whole family has embraced it and when we<br>travel now we travel out on our e-bikes<br>as much as we possibly can taking<br>vehicles off the road and i would say<br>that this is revolutionary and<br>particularly because you've got the<br>range when you go out on your ebike you<br>know we can actually get up to 200<br>kilometer range on an e-bike if you're<br>peddling<br>and of course the benefits the health<br>benefits are now well known that if you<br>put people onto their e-bikes and start<br>cycling you've got great health benefits<br>and i know this i actually cycled with a<br>friend from hamilton to wanganui a few<br>months ago in the winter time and by the<br>end of it we started off with a bit<br>cranky by the end of it we felt really<br>fit and healthy and we got a lot of<br>exercise<br>so you can take the petrol cars off the<br>roads you can reduce congestion we can<br>reduce emissions less threat less noise<br>a quieter safer environment by<br>introducing<br>uh e-bikes and embracing them<br>um and of course it's something that's<br>already happening the growth of um<br>e-bikes has been exponential and and is<br>it outstripping ordinary pedal bikes<br>it's a really good way that we could<br>we could affect our emissions and our<br>health in our local environment so we<br>should take advantage of it<br>unfortunately even in the hamilton cycle<br>plan it doesn't even mention electric so<br>everything you know we need to address<br>this in in our plans<br>and we need to have in particular a<br>really good cycle network which is local<br>and national hamilton's okay on it but<br>it's nowhere near enough i think we are<br>we have an opportunity to embrace a<br>disruptive technology make a big<br>difference and we now need to we need to<br>work on it<br>and uh one of the key things is safety<br>people one reason why you don't cycle is<br>because you're worried about the safety<br>of cycling and we have to do two things<br>one is we have to make safe cycle areas<br>for the increasing number of e-bikes and<br>the other thing is we need to have a<br>program to change the culture where at<br>the moment people you know we'd have a<br>very poor culture in new zealand about<br>um driver's attitude to all cyclists and<br>we need to have it we need to address<br>that and then of course the<br>infrastructure that goes with it<br>charging station three bikes secure lock<br>up areas as well so i believe that<br>e-bikes are a disruptive technology that<br>will make a significant difference to<br>emissions and the whole way that we we<br>deal with transport and i would like to<br>encourage the use of them and the<br>planning for it so that's my statement<br>so thanks for that and i'd like to hand<br>over to kerry crossland who will talk<br>about<br>vehicles electric vehicles<br>how to everybody i've just got a<br>couple of slides to share so i'll just<br>get those set up<br>now<br>can i just get a thumbs up from the<br>panel can people see that awesome<br>great um<br>kyoto everybody like mike said my name<br>is kitty crossland and i'm a sustainable<br>transport planner with mr cagney and i'm<br>really excited to be on this panel today<br>because i've grown up in the white cuts<br>all i studied here um and it's great<br>just to be able to talk about how we can<br>make the climate change issue local<br>and i think when we think about<br>transport<br>um we shouldn't think about in isolation<br>we should think about where we want to<br>go and why we want to get there we don't<br>just get in the car or get on the bus<br>for a sake for the sake of it transport<br>is what enables us to live a good life<br>and as it says on the slide i see<br>i see transformational change coming in<br>the transport sector we need to have it<br>if we're going to have a low carbon<br>transport system but i think this is a<br>really good opportunity to transition to<br>a tren uh transport system which is<br>equitable and efficient as well as low<br>carbon so i'll talk a little bit about<br>the current transport system and the<br>waikato and my vision for the future of<br>transport and then the values i think<br>that will help us to get there<br>so here are a few examples of the<br>transport options we have available in<br>the waikato at the moment<br>i think at this point most of us agree<br>we want less of these things here petrol<br>and diesel cars and other vehicles and<br>we want more of these things on the<br>right trains buses active modes<br>and electric vehicles i've seen a lot of<br>attention on this one here<br>electric cars and i agree that there is<br>a place for electric cars in our low<br>carbon future but i don't think that<br>they're like a magic bullet that's going<br>to solve all our problems and they're<br>certainly not going to help us<br>transition to a low-carbon future in a<br>way that's equitable or efficient<br>there is legitimate need for some people<br>to keep using cars such as disabled<br>people or tradies like you can't take<br>all your tools on the bus at the moment<br>and<br>so there's definitely electric cars in<br>our future but not everybody will be<br>this is a little comparison between<br>petrol and diesel cars<br>and electric cars and as you can see the<br>only problem<br>that electric vehicles really solve when<br>it comes to the problems we see with<br>petrol cars is it reduces the<br>operational emissions so they're a lot<br>cleaner at the tailpipe<br>and they're a lot quieter but the<br>problem with this or like the trade-off<br>is that electric vehicles require some<br>pretty intensive mining and as mike<br>mentioned um for the lithium batteries<br>which is like an emerging technology<br>which will make electric vehicles more<br>efficient um but they also like there's<br>not enough lithium in the world to<br>supply<br>to replace every single car we have at<br>the moment with an electric car so we<br>need some sort of change<br>and i think it's it's a good idea to<br>rename this table problems with car<br>centric planning so even if we all have<br>electric cars we're still going to have<br>urban sprawl we're still going to have<br>congestion you'll be sitting in traffic<br>in an electric car<br>so maybe you don't have exhaust coming<br>out your tailpipe but you're still<br>wasting time<br>and we're still taking over public space<br>and it's still going to be expensive to<br>maintain our roads<br>in comparison electric bikes regular<br>bikes walking<br>they have almost no environmental impact<br>or very little and so transforming the<br>way we think about transport planning<br>to better cater to these modes is a much<br>more efficient way of managing this<br>transition<br>so what are the opportunities we have<br>the opportunity right now to create a<br>transport system that's good for<br>people's health facilitates social<br>interactions and enables everyone to<br>access everything they need for a good<br>life so we can create a transport system<br>that secures the health of people and<br>the environment and everyone still gets<br>where they need to go<br>and i see three values as guiding our<br>decision making and our investment if<br>this is what we're going to achieve<br>the first one is equity at the moment<br>our transport system doesn't work for<br>everyone<br>we need to put equity at the centre of<br>our decision making and make sure that<br>everyone has access to an affordable<br>high quality transport system no matter<br>who they are or where they need to go<br>um at the moment if you're a business<br>person who works nine to five you've got<br>quite a few options you can catch public<br>transport you can drive but if you're a<br>granny picking up your mokopuna from<br>school pretty much the only way you can<br>get there is by car we don't have<br>options for people at the moment<br>and we don't have options for everyone<br>we also need to center efficiency<br>so as we saw on the last slide our<br>current transport system has a lot of<br>problems with it at the moment if we<br>just think about fixing climate change<br>we're not being very efficient we have<br>to undergo radical transformation and<br>this transformation shouldn't just be<br>replacing one type of car with another<br>because otherwise in 10 years we'll<br>still be discussing the same problems<br>it's also important to put people at the<br>center of our decision making and<br>investment<br>traditionally traffic engineers have<br>used the predict and provide approach<br>where a model spits out how many car<br>movements can be expected from a<br>development and then we build a road to<br>reflect that but we know that humans are<br>more complicated than that and<br>much more complex complex than a few<br>pieces of data can ever capture so when<br>we're planning our transport system or<br>planning developments or new roads or<br>new transport systems we should be<br>thinking<br>who who are the people who are going to<br>travel and live here where do they want<br>to go why do they want to get there and<br>how can we support them to make<br>sustainable transports decisions<br>so i'll just return to the slide to sum<br>up this little crash course into<br>the sustainable transport system of the<br>future<br>we need to<br>undergo drastic transformation but we<br>need to do it in a way that enables<br>everyone to have low carbon options<br>and this involves a lot more than<br>electric cars<br>we need to double down into our<br>investment into these modes here public<br>transport and active modes<br>while recognizing that a small number of<br>people will still need an electric car<br>i think that's pretty much everything i<br>have to say and so now<br>i'd like to pass on to stuart from vike<br>thank you curry that was uh<br>it was really um really interesting<br>stuff and um there's not much alignment<br>with<br>uh with the panel um<br>yeah so uh yeah i'm uh stuart penfold<br>from uh bike waikato um we are a<br>volunteer organisation uh we<br>we're across uh we're across the waikato<br>um<br>we do a lot of work in hamilton city uh<br>cambridge area<br>and also waikato district um quite a<br>diverse<br>um<br>sort of catchment i suppose you could<br>say we we obviously have uh the urban<br>areas as well as the um as well as the<br>open spaces um<br>we're a volunteer run organisation uh we<br>have uh quite a diverse i guess<br>you know set of skills in terms of um<br>who we are um including yeah sort of<br>planning and engagement um engineering<br>and design and communications<br>and uh that's sort of that's really<br>helpful um for us to kind of get across<br>the whole um<br>sort of engineering aspects of this and<br>also the social um aspects of<br>of um<br>of cycling we um<br>our role is really to advocate for the<br>community in terms of um<br>cycling um so that's<br>that's for you know cycle uh cycling<br>infrastructure um<br>we<br>we we're basically looking to develop<br>relationships with councils the<br>transport agency<br>um engineering consultancies in the<br>community<br>we<br>you know we um we've grown out of the<br>cycle action riketo um so i guess the<br>organization itself has been around for<br>some time um<br>i guess the last few years have really<br>there's been a real um step change you<br>know there's a bit of a<br>i guess the tipping point and then some<br>would say we've kind of crossed that<br>stopping point now there's a there's a<br>lot of talk about technology there's a<br>lot to talk about ebikes we've had the<br>global pandemic and we've had a lot of<br>people using these um<br>open spaces the road there's been this<br>sort of um reallocation of road space<br>with families<br>taking advantage of of less cars on the<br>road and it's it's really showing that<br>there's a real demand um for<br>safe cycling infrastructure slash<br>reallocation of road space which is<br>traditionally towards vehicles<br>we<br>we advocate<br>we also agitate as necessary we have to<br>um we've got quite a vocal um membership<br>base um social media clearly um can<br>quite easily tip to the agitate kind of<br>area but we're obviously looking to um<br>to balance things out we're looking to<br>effect change um and sometimes the<br>agitation um if it goes too far doesn't<br>quite<br>lead to productive outcomes<br>but it's still very very useful because<br>um as mike quite clearly pointed out<br>there is a lot of um<br>there's a culture change i think that<br>really needs to happen um in new zealand<br>there are um<br>unfortunately still a lot of examples<br>where<br>for some reason um driving behaviour<br>towards cyclists is undesirable um and i<br>think there's a<br>um you know i think it's it's it's that<br>reallocation of road space you know if<br>we can kind of help find a balance of<br>providing safe infrastructure while<br>still accounting for<br>vehicles and and those drivers who<br>for whatever reason<br>um<br>feel i guess impinged in their sort of<br>day-to-day movements then i think that's<br>going to help everybody um congestion<br>you know if we're providing alternatives<br>to<br>um<br>driving um for commuting you know if if<br>that's just your traditional um leg<br>powered cycle if you will the acoustic<br>version versus e-bikes you know if we're<br>getting people out of cars<br>that that helps the traders who can't<br>take their um<br>their heavy plumbing tools or their<br>their skill sores or whatever um<br>that's freeing up that road space for<br>for all for all people um<br>it's quite interesting cargo bikes have<br>become quite a thing um at the moment um<br>and there's a lot of there's a bit of a<br>movement especially in the uk where um<br>those plumbers you know tradies are<br>actually using cargo bikes uh generally<br>it helps if they're they're e cargo<br>bikes um with all the gear um but i<br>think there's a real opportunity in new<br>zealand to um<br>to kind of push that cargo bike kind of<br>area<br>in terms of<br>providing those alternatives to certain<br>people<br>um<br>you know<br>it's um yeah i mean i guess i could talk<br>for hours about sort of what we're<br>looking to do we<br>we really are trying to<br>act for the community get people<br>involved um work with different partners<br>um<br>work for<br>uh sorry work with um<br>funders you know it's the traditional<br>funding model in new zealand um<br>is hasn't traditionally been very<br>good for<br>alternative travel modes um so really<br>we're looking to take advantage of those<br>sort of high level government policies<br>and really sort of advocate and<br>and agitate to really try to get some<br>funding there for safe cycling<br>infrastructure um<br>and encourage encourage more cycling you<br>know i mean there are a lot of kids out<br>there who um<br>who struggle and appearance you know the<br>parents don't want the kids um driving<br>on the road if it's unsafe so we're<br>really looking for that infrastructure<br>again<br>um so that that's that's me um i'll just<br>hand you over to peter boss who um is<br>and i'm here representing living streets<br>at kirikouri hamilton<br>um<br>much of what i'm going to be saying<br>jumps from the um living stress at your<br>website<br>i'll start with uh saying um we're very<br>lucky living in hamilton<br>we've got good um political leadership<br>and making good comments about climate<br>change and in the area of transport<br>there's a there's a very good and<br>embedded understanding of vision zero<br>that's so i'll just um<br>okay living streets interest is<br>in the rights of pedestrians and<br>benefits for walking<br>because<br>walking is the first mode of transport<br>our advocacy is is on promoting<br>friendly<br>communities<br>we want more people walking and enjoying<br>public space<br>to<br>be their young or old fast or slow<br>whether walking community commuting<br>shopping between appointments or out on<br>the street for exercise for leisure or<br>for pleasure<br>living streets vision is more<br>people<br>to walk more often<br>living streets works to develop walking<br>friendly communities throughout new<br>zealand and to promote the social<br>environment and healthy and economic<br>benefits of walking as a means of<br>transport recreation<br>we emphasize the relationship between<br>walking and access to public transport<br>walking is a significant part of climate<br>change and health solutions<br>our objectives<br>to promote walking is healthy<br>accessible cheap<br>sociable environmentally friendly means<br>of transport recreation<br>to promote social and economic benefits<br>pedestrian-friendly communities<br>to work for walk-friendly communities<br>with improved access and conditions for<br>walkers pedestrians<br>runners and children walking to school<br>to advocate for greater representative<br>walkers and pedestrians concerns and<br>land use and transport planning and<br>urban design<br>and to raise a profile of walking and<br>the importance of people meeting face to<br>face<br>and lastly to foster consideration for<br>people with special mobility needs<br>so we end up there and<br>angela<br>thanks peter um yeah so i'm um a<br>counselor at waikato regional council<br>representing the hamilton constituency<br>and i'm just um i have the privilege of<br>cheering our public transport committee<br>um<br>and we work in with uh hamilton city<br>council and<br>um<br>the other councils within the waikato<br>region<br>um and for me it's really important that<br>we take people on this journey um<br>with us and that's members of the public<br>and other politicians um<br>climb the talk about climate and lower<br>emissions um<br>has<br>has really started to give us some<br>momentum<br>and it's um<br>i'm which i'm trying to normalize the<br>conversation<br>um within you know<br>the meetings that we have and with other<br>politicians um and within the waikato we<br>we have such a diverse region um you've<br>got your bigger urban your smaller urban<br>and then your really rural communities<br>so<br>um<br>you know it's not a one-size-fits-all um<br>solution<br>and within um the public transport space<br>we<br>you know we can have our buses we can<br>have our trains which which meet the<br>needs in those urban centres<br>and<br>but there's there are more isolated<br>communities as well so part of our plan<br>moving forward is to work in with<br>community transport<br>which is already you know running<br>shuttles for for health and other<br>appointments and if they have spare<br>seats seeing if we can get people on<br>board um their shuttle buses and yeah<br>really cooperating within the region<br>um<br>one one thing that we are really doing<br>is looking at<br>how within the region we can take<br>politicians along the journey with us<br>and each of their own areas and look at<br>how they can reduce<br>transport emissions so we're looking at<br>you know passenger transport um and also<br>freight as well so we've um<br>we've<br>just recently formed a transport<br>emissions reductions working group<br>and it's made up of<br>um<br>representation from our regional<br>transport committee so<br>it reflects the metro spatial area of<br>hamilton waipa and waikato district as<br>well as a rural uh territorial authority<br>and waka kotahi as well<br>um<br>and and what we'll be using in this<br>group is the decarbonisation tool um<br>just to show which actions we can take<br>which levers we can pull that will<br>really make the most most difference<br>and we've heard from the other speakers<br>today about<br>and the difference that walking cycling<br>um<br>electric cars<br>can make<br>um and i'm keen to also showcase you<br>know even just small changes in the<br>interim as well carpooling car sharing<br>um<br>and all those other modes as well we can<br>not compete with each other but<br>complement each other as well um<br>at the regional council we have um<br>the opportunity to submit to other<br>people other councils and<br>district plans and<br>development plans and<br>yeah we really um advocate for that land<br>use and transport to be linked up<br>and you know higher density housing<br>along pecans<br>along key transport corridor corridor<br>routes um you know<br>smaller community transport hubs<br>community hubs that people can they<br>don't have to go into the cbd<br>necessarily but they can um<br>everything accessible within a short<br>distance as well um working from home<br>um<br>as well as<br>potentially you know e-bikes and e-car<br>electric vehicle ownerships okay<br>um i also want to touch on equity as<br>well um<br>we heard from kitty about an equitable<br>um<br>transport<br>um plan moving forward<br>and um<br>you know that that covers people with<br>disabilities and it also covers um lower<br>income families as well<br>so um low or free public transport<br>would help and i know there's<br>petitions out there at the moment<br>to look at how we could<br>make<br>public transport more affordable for<br>people<br>moving forward as well<br>um<br>yeah<br>i think<br>it's about i'll leave it there for that<br>but there was um<br>and i'll bring it round to um<br>a discussion with the other panelists<br>um<br>yeah there was a lot of talk about um<br>behavior change and a culture change<br>within um<br>within our communities i was wondering<br>if um<br>how we might best enable that culture<br>change and that behaviour change<br>um<br>if anyone had any thoughts on that from<br>well i think it's got to be done i mean<br>i'm sure stuart's got the opinion but<br>it's got to be done at the school<br>level i mean we can have government<br>initiatives and<br>and campaigns but um it's the schools<br>where you've got i mean i think it's a<br>long this isn't a short-term fix this is<br>a long-term culture change so that's<br>where i start<br>yeah that's that's a good point mike i<br>think um<br>yeah it's got at the school level i mean<br>i am i'm lucky enough to live in poronia<br>and um<br>a very<br>relatively small percentage of um<br>of children uh the work uh uh sorry<br>right to um right to school you know and<br>i think um<br>starting at their school level and<br>making it easy for parents and and<br>making them feel comfortable about being<br>able to either ride to school with their<br>children or just as they get older<br>actually allowing the kids to to ride to<br>school themselves and just making it<br>normal you know making it into sort of<br>normal thing um and it starts it starts<br>at that small level you know just that<br>i mean it's obviously a small town but<br>um you can do it in the cities but i<br>mean having that short relatively short<br>distance to school like relational<br>distance um and then<br>that that can change um<br>the other thing maybe i'll just add to<br>that is<br>that sort of maybe wider educational or<br>let's say transport agency um i mean<br>there's a lot of<br>there's a lot of um driver education<br>around say seat belts drink driving that<br>sort of thing and i think there really<br>needs to be a push towards sharing the<br>road um let's look after each other<br>there's other it's not just people in<br>cars using the road there's other<br>there's other parties um so i think<br>there's an opportunity for<br>you know central government to um to<br>actually sort of widen their um<br>why in their driver education<br>yeah good point stu<br>peter do you have some thoughts yes i<br>think it's a lot of it's um<br>continuous improvement where there's a<br>lot of small changes um quick change can<br>can um get resistance but if there's<br>this continuous um<br>and a continuous conversation it is a<br>political um it does take a lot of<br>political leadership and we've seen that<br>with um with viking and with the safest<br>speech when the politicians support it<br>and it was vision zero we've seen that<br>once the politicians picked it up and<br>said we want to do this um<br>it didn't didn't it wasn't a switch that<br>the um traffic engineers wanted to do it<br>but within a few years it became quite<br>embedded and in hamilton it's um<br>yeah when whenever we discuss um<br>transport vision stereo does come up and<br>that is um<br>and that's his start point of the<br>conversation so it's a it's continuous<br>um improvement<br>yeah kitty did you have any thoughts as<br>well yeah i'm peter i liked what you<br>said about the like quick<br>opportunities or opportunities for quick<br>change and i think that's something that<br>we've seen tested in the innovating<br>streets program that happened recently<br>and it's an opportunity just to try<br>something out like they were all<br>short-term<br>short-term things just to see if<br>something would work and<br>when i remember when it was announced<br>and particularly ward street in hamilton<br>everybody said wow like there's just<br>going to be traffic everywhere<br>what's like how how will we survive but<br>we tested it um and the monitoring and<br>evaluation that came out of that showed<br>that there was no more than a 0.7 second<br>delay<br>across the network and so i think just<br>doing stuff like that with really robust<br>political leadership and robust<br>community engagement and just testing it<br>out and giving it a go like maybe it<br>won't work but maybe it will um and it's<br>only through trying something new that<br>we're gonna be able to change our<br>yeah<br>needs<br>because at the moment it's pretty much<br>if you hit someone on a<br>on a on a bike with a car it's not<br>really much of a penalty<br>i mean in other countries if you hit if<br>you hit a cyclist you're you're in<br>trouble so<br>do we need do we need a law change or is<br>that should we should we stick with<br>the carrot or the stick in terms of<br>making this happen and education<br>i think what peter mentioned about<br>vision zero is<br>is the way to go like vision zero<br>it states that any death or serious<br>injury on the road is unacceptable and<br>one of the main ways that you can<br>prevent death and serious injury is<br>through the design of the transport<br>network so we shouldn't have<br>bikes right next to cars on the road<br>going at 80ks an hour like<br>why why would you expect no injuries to<br>happen and we shouldn't have cycle lanes<br>that go right behind angle parks where<br>cars are going to reverse out onto them<br>like for example on ward street i've<br>been backed out onto on a bike by a car<br>and but with like if you redesign it and<br>to reduce those conflict points between<br>cyclists<br>and<br>cars or cyclists and buses you don't<br>need a law because those conflicts don't<br>happen and so i think<br>it's probably a big like<br>multiple-pronged approach with education<br>but also we should design the transport<br>system so that there's no chance for<br>people to get injured even if somebody<br>yeah good good points kitty um<br>now just on that safety and it's<br>starting that behaviour change starting<br>in schools<br>um<br>it is that whole perception of safety um<br>especially for those vulnerable users<br>how<br>could you talked about the<br>infrastructure you know reducing those<br>conflict points<br>um<br>and there's always a challenge with<br>funding<br>and infrastructure change so do you have<br>any um<br>i don't know suggestions or um<br>yeah how<br>i know i know stuart you talked about<br>road via<br>um yeah how<br>what is a more affordable way<br>you go to to bring about that change for<br>stuart or kitty yeah baby steps um<br>i think um<br>i mean kitty i think you're your ward<br>street example<br>um<br>like i think communication is is really<br>is really key uh<br>you know sort of<br>communicating to the to the different<br>users i guess at that space what what<br>what the intention of that project is um<br>and i think that goes for any sort of<br>um<br>any sort of i guess reallocation so<br>clear communication about what what what<br>the project's trying to achieve<br>who it's trying to benefit um<br>maybe making it clear say for example<br>the you know the classic no offense to<br>any transport planners but the classic<br>0.7 second delay you know like<br>rather than just saying hey it's 0.7<br>seconds of a delay putting that in kind<br>of maybe<br>real world kind of language to saying<br>mums and dads who<br>might be driving their kids to school or<br>whatever um and and yeah just kind of<br>coming up with a<br>maybe yeah just<br>just putting a bit of effort into that<br>kind of community engagement and<br>communications and and not<br>underestimating the power of that um<br>yeah so i think those those those sort<br>of baby steps and those small community<br>kind of<br>scale um reallocations are really<br>helpful um it's just how you know<br>the implementation of those little<br>projects is so key<br>um<br>yeah<br>yeah you're so right um<br>um<br>all the communication with people are so<br>important because if you just introduce<br>a change and you're not explaining to<br>people why and what benefits they might<br>get out of it like it's no surprise that<br>people are resistant<br>and but i think when it comes to funding<br>there's quite a few opportunities<br>and the long-term kind of view is if<br>we've got less cars on the road then uh<br>we're going to have a lot of money left<br>over because we're not going to be<br>repairing the roads as much<br>um because cars cars and trucks are<br>terrible for roads like if we didn't<br>have cars or trucks we'd never have to<br>repair the road so if we've got less of<br>them then<br>that's less money we have have to spend<br>on roads and more money we can be<br>spending on bike infrastructure and<br>safety improvements but until we get to<br>that point i think the biggest<br>opportunity<br>is introducing a congestion charge in<br>city centres and we've seen this lots of<br>examples of this overseas where<br>overnight they've introduced a<br>congestion charge in the next day<br>there's hardly any traffic<br>which is a great climate outcome because<br>people have chosen to use a different<br>mode um but the people who are like nah<br>i don't care like i'm just gonna pay to<br>drive you can collect those funds and<br>like hypothecate them or allocate them<br>to a specific purpose and one of those<br>purposes could be investing in really<br>good options for other people um or or<br>like alternative options for people who<br>decide that they actually don't want to<br>drive anymore and i think that's in the<br>short term that's a way we can kind of<br>get that jump start<br>which will enable us to put in the<br>infrastructure which will like start<br>this big cycle where less and less<br>people drive because it's more<br>attractive to use the other modes and<br>it will be more affordable like we spend<br>so much money on cars at the moment and<br>we never really questioned it but as<br>soon as we want to improve safety for<br>bike bikers and walkers and<br>improve public transport all of a sudden<br>we're asking oh where's the money going<br>to come from<br>yeah there's one one issue with that is<br>if you go back 20 years in london when<br>they started that process the um<br>and i switched from trains to bikes to<br>cycle to london and when i did that i<br>literally had a whole cycle network map<br>system that i could choose and i could<br>cycle in with almost no danger<br>with traffic because they'd already set<br>it up what we're doing is the other way<br>around we're gonna say right okay you<br>drive in<br>we won't be able to drive it unless you<br>get a congestion charge but we don't<br>have the infrastructure<br>there's so many pinch points in hamilton<br>that are unsafe for cyclists that need<br>to be sorted out that um that needs to<br>be done before you<br>then<br>put a congestion charge in and i'm just<br>talking from experience of seeing what<br>happened in london<br>and when when it happened the amount of<br>cyclists was unbelievable<br>i can imagine it was just hundreds of us<br>all over the place and it was it became<br>a really good light club<br>it sounds sounds really positive<br>um<br>just<br>on um we've talked a little bit about<br>the conflict between maybe cars and<br>bikes<br>um<br>the conflict between other modes isn't<br>so often talked about<br>um<br>and you know sharing the space um<br>i know we mentioned um<br>in our chat beforehand about um conflict<br>between walkers and bikes and bikes and<br>e-bikes and<br>um<br>scooters on footpaths etc etc peter i'm<br>wondering if you had any thoughts around<br>um<br>you know from a walker's perspective um<br>how other mode users can<br>help them feel safe as they are walking<br>yeah<br>we'd like to start a conversation about<br>responsibility and sort of<br>responsibility increases with weight and<br>speed<br>so it's not just about um bikers cars<br>trucks<br>runners walkers it's about um if you're<br>if you're walking um<br>and somebody is running then the<br>the um<br>the runner as a guest becomes the guest<br>and becomes more responsible and that<br>goes goes goes up as speed and weight<br>goes up so like a um a a child riding a<br>bike on the footpath<br>um it's<br>it's not safe for them to go onto the<br>road so we have to accept that um but<br>then you get someone who's working<br>faster um and and the the threat they<br>give<br>the responsibility should be um<br>seen as theirs not the um the weaker or<br>yep so it's a question of the etiquette<br>yeah yeah yes yes so um yeah the<br>footpath is primary um<br>the pedestrians right away<br>and everyone else is a guest<br>and um<br>um the the the priority is this is the<br>weaker has the um<br>i don't think the week is probably we're<br>supposed to use but they're more<br>vulnerable as as a right of way and the<br>greater protection<br>yeah good point um i know i've recently<br>been out biking with with my kids who<br>range in age from eight up to<br>twelve<br>and it's it's always that<br>um teaching them to be respectful of<br>other users<br>um bringing their bowels if they don't<br>have a bowel calling out um and and<br>slowing down as well as you're passing<br>people<br>yeah<br>often it's um<br>i don't know i always tell them to to<br>keep left as well um but then you have<br>the conflict of um other users who who<br>don't keep left<br>yeah yeah traditionally yeah<br>we'll go<br>wander<br>and lift right um and and uh yeah it's<br>um<br>it's leisure<br>it's not not um it's not like the road<br>where you've you've got strict rules<br>yeah yeah so yeah everyone else using<br>the footpath really has to respect that<br>they're a guest there and done<br>the rules have been loosened a lot and<br>that's that's where a lot of living<br>streets um this is trying to hang on to<br>as much<br>protection for the pedestrians as they<br>can<br>yeah<br>now that that's that's fair enough um<br>yeah just um we've got a couple more<br>minutes i just wanted to talk on<br>technology and um<br>autonomous cars<br>um<br>there has been some um<br>you know<br>people say that it is coming um<br>and in my sort of mind<br>you know that possibly would add a<br>little bit more congestion because<br>they're constantly circling the city<br>picking people up um<br>but<br>you know<br>everything could contribute to making um<br>transport um lower climate like um lower<br>emissions um does anyone have any<br>thoughts or insights onto autonomous<br>vehicles and where that technology may<br>lead<br>well we actually do research in that<br>area and um<br>it's it's definitely coming<br>i think this is one that is<br>it's very technically difficult to do so<br>we actually have phds in this area<br>working on agricultural vehicles the the<br>rules there's a simple rule in um with<br>um currently with passenger vehicles is<br>that it always for a safety aspect it<br>always refers back to the driver yeah<br>with agricultural vehicles it you can't<br>do that you actually have to be fully<br>autonomous so that may adds an extra<br>challenge but the technology now<br>is such that i don't think it is quite<br>there yet but<br>within our lifetime you will definitely<br>see some autonomous vehicles on the road<br>but they they don't have to be big heavy<br>nasty machines they could be<br>quite efficient machines that that are<br>you know you get in and it will like a<br>little pod<br>that will take you from a to b within a<br>city and that's the sort of thing<br>that um<br>that is is viable in fact we actually<br>built a little pod a few years ago like<br>that which we tried out and it was quite<br>cool but it's gonna it's gonna take a<br>while for that technology to have the<br>confidence<br>um for people to get you know to meet<br>the safety requirements which are gonna<br>be absolutely<br>um you know one like the tesla car that<br>had the fatal crash you know you've<br>gotta you've gotta dot every eye and<br>cross every t to make them uh viable<br>i think predictive uh predictability is<br>okay so um i mean as<br>you know like unpredictability is a<br>of of driver behavior i guess is a um<br>such a massive hazard on the road you<br>know you're not entirely sure what the<br>driver is thinking and what um what<br>they're gonna do<br>um so i think you know autonomous<br>vehicles in urban areas<br>it's fine in theory as long as the<br>technology is there if they're<br>predictable so if you know if there's a<br>certain speed<br>if there are certain tracks um i think<br>there are yeah there's an opportunity<br>for them in urban areas for sure<br>um<br>yeah because you could<br>quite easily well maybe not quite easily<br>maybe that's the wrong maybe that's not<br>the right way of putting it but um i'm<br>sure you could develop predictability<br>into that um into that technology<br>yeah one of one of the problems with<br>them is that um a lot of the decision<br>making or identification of objects is<br>done using a technology called machine<br>learning which is pretty much a black<br>box effect so someone got killed by an<br>electric vehicle<br>and then you have to how was that<br>decision made for that vehicle to do<br>what it did and suddenly you're you're<br>into an area of machines that are making<br>decisions through a black box approach<br>rather than you could actually trace<br>back what happened so that's just<br>imagine the legal mind field that we're<br>gonna face with that so anyone who<br>thinks they're just gonna come in and<br>off we go it's gonna take a while to<br>i think you raised a really interesting<br>point about the machine learning<br>thermite um i've i'm not claiming to be<br>an expert in autonomous vehicles but as<br>a transport planner it is something i'm<br>interested in um and i've seen some<br>research um coming out of the us<br>which kind of dives into the equity<br>impacts of that machine learning and<br>because most of uh like real<br>technological experts and our code<br>riders and stuff like that they all tend<br>to be like european men<br>which means that any unconscious bias<br>they have is written into the code and<br>so this research coming out of the us<br>has shown that in in trials like<br>modeling and trials um african-american<br>people are hit far more frequently by an<br>autonomous vehicle than a white person<br>and so i think it's<br>it's like going to open up a really<br>interesting dilemma and really<br>interesting implications for our<br>technological industry and i just i<br>think that's really interesting at the<br>same time as being like a really<br>terrible outcome so yeah i'm interested<br>yeah that's an interesting um yeah<br>observation kitty um yeah i suppose<br>watch the space and we'll see where the<br>technology leads us hey i'd just like to<br>finish on um talking a little bit about<br>equity and<br>the just just transition to<br>more climate friendly transport<br>um obviously walking is as free as<br>peter's told us um<br>at the moment electric vehicles are<br>still unaffordable for so many people<br>and biking is a bit more affordable um<br>but even just the price of um e-bikes<br>and cargo bikes um do we see<br>those prices coming down in the near<br>future<br>um<br>yeah<br>yeah i mean that's so it's a um i was<br>actually going to cover that but i sort<br>of fell off the list um<br>i mean we we one of our um<br>our chairperson actually has his father<br>uh does a lot of work with um secondhand<br>bikes and and pretty much gives them<br>away<br>so there are you know there are a lot of<br>bikes in the world um<br>a lot of bikes you know as kids grow up<br>um quite often they find their way find<br>their way into into landfill so if<br>there's you know there's these<br>incredible repurposing opportunities for<br>um to buy bicycles um<br>unfortunately you know human nature um<br>you kind of want the best and the best<br>sometimes and there are some ridiculous<br>amounts of money um spent on on bicycles<br>um but i you know<br>that's it yeah as yeah as i said before<br>there's there's real opportunities for<br>repurposing um older bikes and<br>i think yeah there's there's<br>opportunities there uh go go eco i think<br>um in hamilton<br>to do the program um and it's something<br>that's something that we're looking into<br>um<br>is sort of encouraging<br>um you know the repurposing and making<br>it easy for people to to grab a bike um<br>because it's it's just so easy once<br>you've got that work<br>yeah we have um<br>four four bikes in our family are all of<br>the old bikes that we've that i've<br>converted to electric and the typical<br>kit is a you know you can get a kit for<br>about a thousand dollars<br>so that if you want to buy an e-bike it<br>might be four thousand dollars to get a<br>good one so you could do it at a<br>fraction of the price so that's what i<br>did with all of ours and uh you know my<br>wife wants up to nearly six thousand<br>kilometers of e-biking that would have<br>been probably in a car<br>that shows you know what what the<br>yeah that's that's really interesting eh<br>um<br>yeah i know we've got the fee baits on<br>um electric vehicles um<br>and the other thing is um<br>we don't always have to own everything<br>ourselves you know we've got this<br>the scooters that we can hire and i i<br>think that hamilton city is looking at<br>introducing um bikes<br>into that scheme as well so<br>yeah there's always that option as as<br>well um<br>yeah<br>i think i think we'll finish there thank<br>you so much um to the panelists for your<br>time today um much appreciated and um<br>special thanks the university of waikato<br>as well for um yeah enabling this<br>conversation to take place<br>so thank
