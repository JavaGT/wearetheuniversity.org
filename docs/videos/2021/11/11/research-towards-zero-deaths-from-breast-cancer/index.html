Since 2017 their exciting research partnership is supporting Ferrier’s scientists to develop an immunotherapy vaccine that could stop cancer returning after treatment. This could be manufactured right here in New Zealand. Hear from the scientists how the vaccine works and from breast cancer survivors about what this would mean to them. <br><br>For more information visit: www.wgtn.ac.nz/engage/giving/donate/areas/breast-cancer-research-programme</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>in our group at the fairia research<br>institute we make therapeutic vaccines<br>with a focus towards cancer and other<br>diseases the breast cancer foundation<br>new zealand funding has allowed us to<br>transfer our existing research knowledge<br>and apply it specifically to breast<br>cancer to help design a treatment that<br>will help patients with breast cancer in<br>new zealand the trouble with cancer is<br>that it's just a dysregulation of our<br>own cells and our body struggles to<br>differentiate between a healthy cell<br>that's ours and a cancer cell that's<br>also ours so our therapeutic vaccines<br>allow our immune system to be trained to<br>recognize these dangerous cancer cells<br>and they can go out and target them<br>destroying all of the cancer and leaving<br>my name's jenny mcdougall i had breast<br>cancer 10 years ago now my kids were 5<br>and 7 years old at the time<br>i had the standard treatment which is<br>surgery chemotherapy and radiotherapy<br>which is very successful<br>but it's no picnic<br>we we refer to it as slash poison and<br>burn<br>i think it's at the back of everyone's<br>mind we all know that it's possible it<br>could come back<br>and we don't think about it all the time<br>but you always know<br>that's a possibility<br>my name is penelope ryder lewis and i'm<br>ambassador for this exciting fundraising<br>campaign<br>my family doesn't have a great history<br>when it comes to breast cancer<br>my nana and my nana's sister and my mum<br>all had it and my mum died from it<br>i was diagnosed with breast cancer when<br>i was 41.<br>this research is being done right here<br>in new zealand we hope there'll be a<br>vaccine to save the lives of new<br>zealanders<br>then a vaccine to save lives around the<br>world<br>but to do that we need support 20 to 30<br>percent will have their cancer come back<br>sometimes years later<br>at that point doctors can give treatment<br>to prolong life but there's no cure so<br>tragically more than 650 women still die<br>of this disease every year that's what<br>we need to change and that's why we<br>partnered with the ferrier institute to<br>get to our vision we're constantly<br>pushing for new frontiers in early<br>detection treatment and support<br>we approached them back in 2016 to<br>discuss a partnership to work towards a<br>therapeutic vaccine for breast cancer<br>when we met the team and realized the<br>caliber of people in their work<br>investing 500 000 was one of the easiest<br>and most exciting investment decisions<br>our board has ever made<br>we're at the point where this<br>partnership is producing hugely valuable<br>intellectual property we want that to<br>stay in new zealand and ideally we want<br>local manufacturing of any new drug that<br>results from this work if i can spare<br>one person what i went through<br>it's worth it<br>and if i can spare one person what my<br>mum went through<br>it's worth it<br>it would be great for me and my family<br>to know that there's something extra<br>that we could do<br>to have something that's going to help<br>my immune system to fight it if it does<br>come back<br>we're incredibly grateful that breast<br>cancer foundation of new zealand has<br>supported us and is continuing to<br>support us<br>the next thing we need to do is get an<br>approval to run a human clinical trial<br>here in new zealand<br>and then to run that trial and that's<br>going to take quite a lot of resource<br>and we're going to need a lot of help<br>from the community to do that<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
