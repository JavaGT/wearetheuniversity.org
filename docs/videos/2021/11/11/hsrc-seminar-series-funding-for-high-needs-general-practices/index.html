Dr Mona Jeffreys and Tessa Senior, from the Health Services Research Centre, modelled the funding received by hypothetical practices with different proportions of high needs patients, to establish whether there is structural inequity in the general practice funding formulae.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be

series which um<br>had stopped since uh before<br>uh lockdown<br>first lockdown<br>um just to let you know that this is<br>being recorded and the recording will be<br>made available on our website as there<br>are a number of people who aren't able<br>to come today but it is really lovely to<br>be able to see people in a face-to-face<br>seminar environment it feels like it has<br>so our talk today is called<br>concentrations of complexity and this<br>has been a collaborative piece of work<br>and it's going to be presented jointly<br>by myself by mona jeffries the senior<br>research fellow at take away<br>holder the health services research<br>centre just upstairs and tessa signo who<br>is a research assistant with us at the<br>moment as well as<br>i said<br>i don't have a microphone on this door<br>sorry was it was there a question from<br>zoom<br>slides<br>so<br>i'm sorry<br>as i mentioned this is i was a<br>collaborative uh piece of work so the<br>other people involved were um mikey and<br>jackie from uh from victoria university<br>wellington who both worked with us and<br>uh kenny ho and peter crampton from the<br>university of otago<br>i'd just like to acknowledge the funding<br>which came from the royal new zealand<br>college of gp's research and education<br>committee as well as the hsc programme<br>grant<br>on enhancing primary healthcare services<br>to mute please because there's a bit of<br>distraction coming through<br>there's a couple of you there who aren't<br>muted so if you could do that would be<br>great<br>so background to this study then what<br>we're interested in is whether the<br>current model of primary healthcare<br>funding<br>is equitable<br>so what we're really looking at this is<br>on a practice level not on an individual<br>level<br>so as a bit of background then<br>capitation funding began in 2001. so<br>what i mean by capitation funding is<br>funding which comes from<br>the government uh through dhbs and phos<br>to general practices and is given on a<br>per capita basis so for every person<br>enrolled at a practice a practice<br>receives a certain amount of annual<br>funding for that person<br>and this replaced a fee-for-service<br>model where essentially you paid as you<br>went to the gp<br>there still are co-payments by patients<br>as you'll know and those that can vary<br>from<br>very little or nothing to<br>a lot of nuances to the capitation<br>funding and test is going to go into a<br>lot of those details um as we go through<br>the presentation but very broadly there<br>are two types of practice and these are<br>not<br>don't cover all the practices because<br>there's also um<br>there are other types as well but most<br>practices<br>are either vlca or not and vlca stands<br>for very low-cost access practices<br>now those are practices which the<br>government gives a higher level of<br>capitation funding per person enrolls<br>in return for the practice guaranteeing<br>to cap<br>the fee which they charge the<br>co-payments which they charge and<br>currently for an adult age over 14<br>that's capped at 19.50<br>some of those practices do charge less<br>and they're they're at least to do that<br>to be a vlca practice a practice needs<br>to serve a population which is<br>more than half<br>what we call high needs patients or i<br>shouldn't say we call what has been<br>defined as high needs patients that<br>means patients who are either maori<br>pacific<br>or living in<br>the most deprived quintile what we call<br>nz depth five and just a quick um<br>sideways step for those of you who<br>aren't familiar with that um analogy<br>that i know that um that do not consider<br>those who are<br>developed these measures are online um<br>are<br>so this is a way of measuring an area<br>level a small area level deprivation<br>small areas are then ranked across the<br>whole country and broken into five equal<br>chunks so when we say nz 5 we mean<br>the<br>20<br>of the small areas in new zealand which<br>are most deprived both deprived being<br>based on nine census level<br>measures such as uh unemployment and<br>overcrowding that sort of thing<br>so coming back to the lca to be a vlc<br>practice you need to be serving and what<br>we might consider as high needs patients<br>so<br>in one of those three categories and<br>there is a very complicated funding<br>formula that defines the level of<br>capitation funding that a<br>practice receives<br>and that takes into account a number of<br>different factors and as i said tess is<br>so why might it matter that different<br>practices get different amounts of money<br>well we<br>it doesn't take much to imagine that<br>patients who have got higher needs have<br>got more chronic conditions therefore<br>probably do have higher levels of<br>utilization<br>we're talking mainly here about gp<br>utilization but obviously also<br>practice nurse and nurse practitioner<br>utilization as well and just as an<br>example then if you're treating a<br>patient with diabetes then you're<br>expected to do to monitor their blood<br>glucose regularly if you're treating<br>patients with asthma<br>you're expected to<br>offer multiple return appointments to<br>make sure that their their treatment is<br>optimized<br>so when you have<br>a group of patients which on average has<br>got a higher prevalence of these chronic<br>conditions you would expect them to use<br>the services that you're providing at a<br>higher level<br>but the capitation funding doesn't<br>really take that into account because<br>all it does is say this is the age sex<br>breakdown of your patients and so we're<br>going to give you a certain amount of<br>money it doesn't tell us anything about<br>other than the age determination of<br>chronic conditions so that the older you<br>get the more chronic conditions you may<br>have on average<br>then the funding formula doesn't take<br>into account<br>these high needs patients<br>i should say the basic funding formula<br>the basic capitation formula because<br>there are more nuanced um additions<br>so our research question was whether<br>general practice capitation funding<br>accounts for what we call the<br>concentrations of complexity so when<br>we've got a higher proportion of high<br>needs patients the concentrations of<br>more complex and a higher level of<br>chronic conditions and i'd like to<br>acknowledge peter crampton who came up<br>with this lovely phrase concentrations<br>of complexity and we have<br>so we're going to look at four different<br>sector data to try to understand and<br>answer this question we're firstly going<br>to look at the prevalence of chronic<br>conditions across what we call high<br>needs compared to not high needs<br>patients<br>we're going to look at the level of<br>primary healthcare utilization among<br>these people<br>we're going to look at unmet needs and<br>by that i mean barriers to<br>primary healthcare so<br>and whether we know that somebody needs<br>care but is unable to access it<br>and then we're going to look at practice<br>level funding so i'm going to look at<br>the first three sets of those um<br>those results and then tess is going to<br>look at the practice level funding and<br>so the data sources for the first part<br>i'm going to describe to you coming from<br>the new zealand health survey we wanted<br>to use data that was pre-covered 19 so<br>we're using the data from the 2018-19<br>health survey this is a survey of about<br>15 000 patients which is<br>conducted i've actually been in the<br>field um for a long time and since 2011<br>has been in the field constantly and<br>every year then a set of data released<br>by the ministry of health<br>the data awaited to<br>allow the results to represent the uh<br>results of artillery new zealand<br>weighted in terms of of the respondents<br>the data that tess is going to show you<br>and a lot of it comes from the pho<br>services agreement<br>dated july this year as well as<br>publicly available distribution of high<br>user health cards and community services<br>cards that are on the ministry of health<br>website<br>and as i said then in determining what<br>uh is allowed to be a vlca practice or<br>not then high needs is used<br>uh to describe people who are either<br>maori pacific or living in nz5<br>and i'd just like to acknowledge that<br>that's<br>not our term that's a term that we've<br>adopted<br>so for the new zealand health survey<br>data i'm going to show to you we're<br>going to look at utilization which is<br>the number of gp visits in the last 12<br>months so this is self-reported people<br>were asked to remember how many times<br>they'd been to the doctor in the last 12<br>months<br>we're going to report on the presence of<br>chronic illness<br>so there was a list of 10<br>common chronic illnesses that<br>people were asked to say whether they<br>had ever been diagnosed or treated for<br>and we're also going to look at unmet<br>need and the unmet need question is<br>people who answered that they had had<br>a need to see a gp in the last 12 months<br>so across the country then on average<br>people visit the gp 3.1 times per year<br>and announce a bit less than once a year<br>but we know that<br>that isn't<br>the same across the whole population we<br>know that gp utilization rates are<br>higher for women than for men<br>particularly for younger women<br>we know that utilization rates are<br>higher for high needs people<br>and for older adults<br>similarly nurse utilization rates are<br>higher for older adults for mari<br>possibly for pacific people although<br>that's not showing up in the new zealand<br>health survey data<br>and for women living in more socially<br>deprived areas and that's interestingly<br>not the case for men in socially<br>when we look at the proportion of people<br>who have<br>three or more chronic conditions that's<br>over on the right-hand side of this<br>graph then we can see here we've got the<br>bars of the chinese people<br>in blue and the bars of the not<br>highlights people in red and we can see<br>that<br>sorry to ask again anyone on soon<br>could mute please<br>thank you<br>so we know we can see here that people<br>who<br>are high needs<br>patients are more likely to have<br>three or more chronic conditions or to<br>report three or more chronic conditions<br>you can also see that people who are<br>high needs patients are less likely to<br>report no chronic conditions<br>that sort of sounds a bit like it's<br>self-evident but you have to remember<br>how we're defining high knees this is<br>actually not really based on need at all<br>it's based on ethnicity and where you<br>live<br>we then want to look at<br>how many times patients who are high<br>needs see their gp so you remember that<br>i said on average people see their gp<br>three just over three times<br>uh per year<br>if we look at the high needs patients<br>again um here's shown in blue<br>then we can see that highly patients are<br>much more likely to visit their gp seven<br>or more times<br>or to report having seen a gp7 or more<br>times in the last 12 months and if we<br>add up these two bars then the high<br>needs patients<br>about uh 8.7 to report<br>going seven or more times compared to<br>six<br>point six percent of the not high needs<br>patients<br>so i've just noticed there's a chat come<br>up so<br>thank you very much that's a comment<br>that we'll address in the questions so<br>appreciate those comments coming through<br>on the chat<br>i'd also just like to highlight here the<br>difference in<br>not having seen a gp at all<br>in the last 12 months and<br>we can see here that this is probably<br>what we're talking about when we talk<br>about unmet needs so these are people<br>who<br>probably did need to see a doctor but<br>weren't able to to go and that might<br>have been because of cost might have<br>been because of other barriers as well<br>so when we look at chronic illnesses<br>then<br>we can see that for a number of<br>different chronic illnesses then there<br>are there's a much higher prevalence in<br>people who are uh high needs patients<br>and that's particularly evident for<br>asthma and for type 2 diabetes which i'm<br>sure isn't<br>a surprise<br>at all for many of you<br>but actually what we're interested in<br>here is not those specific conditions<br>but we're interested in the burden of<br>disease so we looked at people who had<br>three or more chronic conditions<br>and nearly 15 percent of people who are<br>high needs reported three or more<br>chronic conditions could be any any<br>three<br>compared to about 12<br>of the not high needs patients<br>so we can see then that patients who are<br>high needs have<br>clearly got a higher level of chronic<br>disease burden and a higher level of<br>utilization<br>then when we look at unmet needs due to<br>cost then we can see here on the top two<br>bars so these are people who say that<br>they needed to see a gp in the last 12<br>months but didn't because of cost<br>we can see here that about 18 of people<br>who are high needs reported that<br>compared to about 11<br>of those who are not chinese<br>when we look at transport as a barrier<br>to getting primary care we can see that<br>that's reported much more frequently<br>than those who are high needs about six<br>percent compared to two percent<br>and when we look at being unable to get<br>an appointment at all<br>whether that's with a gp a nurse or<br>other healthcare worker we can see again<br>that that's more<br>more prevalent or more common in people<br>who<br>are high needs<br>patients<br>so in summary then we can see that<br>patients who<br>are high needs have got a higher burden<br>of chronic disease<br>a higher level of actually seeing the<br>doctor as well as a high level of facing<br>barriers to see a doctor or a primary<br>healthcare worker when they need to<br>so that really sets the scene for what<br>um tessa is going to present and i just<br>like to<br>acknowledge the huge amount of work that<br>tess has done she's come in as an<br>undergraduate being given this project<br>and has really taken it and flown with<br>it it's been really fun working with her<br>and it is still<br>in progress so we're not quite<br>we haven't quite finalized all our<br>analysis yet but<br>it's got some really interesting results<br>so i'll look forward to getting to share<br>them with you<br>thank you<br>hello everyone so<br>i will be sharing with you the next part<br>of our results which is the hypothetical<br>practices<br>so we have four of them we have a<br>practice that has 30 honey<br>patients so 17 knots high knees and then<br>50<br>i need so half isn't half isn't<br>and then 70 and 90 proportion of high<br>needs patients in these hypothetical<br>practices and we are assuming the<br>practices 5 000 patients we've taken 5<br>000 as<br>kind of an average and as um<br>mona spoke about earlier this<br>information is from the enrollment<br>data so we can we like to think we can<br>um<br>our results are representative of the<br>actual population because the spread<br>will be from accurate enrollment data<br>so i'll talk through each of these<br>pools as i get to them but just as an<br>overview um each practice gets<br>capitation funding as we spoke about<br>earlier and the<br>blca practices are separate practices so<br>you're either elca or you're<br>regular<br>essentially and the lca yep funding and<br>then there's community service card<br>funding high user health card and<br>something called zero freeze for under<br>so this<br>is this is actually two hypothetical<br>practices so we've got in blue<br>this is the hypothetical 5 000 patient<br>100<br>high needs practice and then in pink<br>this is 100 not high needs so this is<br>essentially<br>um<br>giving the distribution of age and how<br>that differs because as we know<br>maori have a<br>greater spread their age spread is a lot<br>higher towards younger people and for<br>non-high needs there is a lot<br>um greater spread of older people<br>so it's just an interesting<br>representation of<br>obviously the capitation funding formula<br>is based on<br>so for our four hypothetical practices<br>this is the rate of capitation funding<br>they would<br>receive as you can see and this is our 5<br>000 practice of hypothetical<br>patience the 30 practice<br>gets roughly so annual funding of the<br>base capitation they get roughly 8 200.<br>and as we go up and jump<br>60 percent<br>of high needs enrolled patients<br>we go up to 818 000<br>which<br>is in that much of a jump of<br>need and as we spoke about the<br>concentration of<br>complexity and prevalence of chronic<br>conditions there's not a huge jump in<br>the capitation funding to account for<br>that<br>so high user health cards are<br>they are<br>something the<br>gp applies for on behalf of the patient<br>and the patient must have visited the<br>doctor or<br>actually i can't be sure of that so i'll<br>take that back<br>the gp<br>12 or more times in a year for an<br>existing chronic condition<br>so high user health cards are<br>essentially for<br>chinese people who do have those chronic<br>for a start this this here so annually<br>not even two thousand dollars that's not<br>a huge amount it's quite a small<br>income and it actually goes down<br>the higher<br>the<br>amount of high needs patients which as<br>we spoke about in these statistics<br>earlier we know that<br>high in these patients visit the gp<br>12 or more times<br>community service cards these<br>there's been a recent<br>ish 2018 policy that actually tried to<br>make community service cards more of a<br>more more impactful for chinese people<br>and again they<br>kind of aimed to serve as high needs<br>people and help them with access<br>um<br>reasons for having a community service<br>cards being on a lower income<br>being on a housing benefit and being<br>older is actually shown to be a<br>determinant of receiving a community<br>service card<br>so<br>this yeah this is the funding and we see<br>it does increase with percentages but<br>the 90 practice doesn't quite have 60<br>percent more<br>um<br>funding as you would potentially expect<br>to see<br>uh just some statistics how many people<br>have a community service card in 2018<br>there were eight thousand<br>eight hundred and eighteen thousand<br>people<br>who had one roughly twelve percent of<br>and<br>fees free for under 14s this is<br>reasonably self-explanatory if you're<br>under 14 you don't have to pay<br>co-payments and obviously the practices<br>get this<br>subsidy<br>for them<br>and just to note vlca practices<br>it's<br>we're for the sake of our study we're<br>saying that they do not get this because<br>that is apparently incorporated into<br>their<br>vlca funding but there are some<br>practice level<br>um policy that means some of them may<br>but we are but most of them don't<br>because that's included in<br>the lca<br>funding<br>so onto the vlca funding and<br>as we spoke about earlier<br>very low cost access practices are<br>designed essentially for high needs<br>people because you have to have 50 of<br>enrolled<br>people being high needs and that<br>technique can span<br>so you have to have half of your own<br>patients my needs but the other half<br>so they were introduced to combat access<br>for chinese people<br>because<br>as we spoke about vlc uh you<br>have a capped co-payment if you're part<br>of a vlca practice<br>and<br>hence we haven't modeled the 30 practice<br>because that wouldn't exist because you<br>have to go on 50 high needs<br>and<br>note that the formula for vlca funding<br>is the same as capitation so it's done<br>on age and sex despite catering for a<br>different population the formula<br>still uses age as a one of its only<br>determinants<br>and yeah as you can see the 90<br>practice has a lower level of funding<br>than the 70 practice<br>likely due to the distribution of age<br>again<br>and this is<br>the two so this is the nom<br>the vlc practice and i have made a<br>mistake by leaving this 30 percent one<br>in here because they wouldn't get 30 and<br>that was something i'm supposed to do<br>this morning and i haven't<br>but just ignore that just ignore that<br>and yeah so this is the funding level<br>for non-vrc practices so it sits just<br>below um the one two mark and then here<br>we see vlca<br>sits just above the one two so not a<br>huge amount of difference<br>there<br>so in summary for this part high needs<br>patients have greater utilization multi<br>morbidity and unmet need<br>plc funding adds significant but does<br>not account for varying levels of need<br>and community service cards have added<br>but not a significant amount to the<br>funding<br>the same with high user health cards<br>it's very minimal what they add<br>and the cavitation formula<br>does not account for the age spread of<br>high need<br>populations<br>so this i just stressed this is not our<br>work this is the work of<br>sapira who wrote a report on the to<br>estimate the underfunding of maori in<br>healthcare um really interesting report<br>but so they have also modeled 5 000<br>people for practices and they included<br>the co-payments which we haven't<br>me<br>they<br>address a 5000 patient practice this<br>would be the normal one so the non-vlca<br>and this would be the vlca<br>income<br>um including the co-payments which as we<br>can see the overall<br>total income for this hypothetical<br>practice is less for vlca patients<br>and they also say in the report that<br>um<br>they have<br>elca practices have a higher patient<br>turnover and higher patient complexity<br>as we addressed earlier on and a much<br>higher<br>amount of unpaid co-payments so when you<br>take that into account as well their<br>income just<br>so<br>in conclusion capitation funding alone<br>does not account for the concentration<br>of complexity<br>funding from either rely on asian sex<br>demographics demographics are not<br>sufficient in accounting for utilization<br>associated with finance populations<br>and the funding model for vrc practice<br>can financially disadvantage these<br>practices for trying to help chinese<br>people<br>and there is evidence of structural<br>discrimination in the health sector<br>based on the funding available to<br>practice yourself why needs populations<br>and i believe<br>that is<br>it<br>uh if there's any questions we would<br>love to answer them<br>have you looked at all of the<br>impact so what<br>impact of of patients<br>on the patients we haven't actually i<br>think<br>it would mean<br>i suppose we're assuming that higher<br>level of chronic conditions and you<br>would<br>get less access to appointments and less<br>time with um the nurse or the<br>that is true<br>owner can you answer that no no it<br>happens quite difficult to i guess to do<br>on a practice level given this<br>frustrating lack of<br>individual level health data on a gp<br>practice level that's uh not available<br>nationally<br>we could probably look at it on a<br>in terms of hospitalizations<br>and so we are doing another bit of work<br>as part of the program grant where we're<br>looking at aspects of um of practices<br>and so that will include the lca<br>non-vrca in terms of outcomes on<br>hospitalizations<br>is an interesting one it's<br>it's quite tricky to do um so we've got<br>a<br>negan who's sitting at the back there is<br>a experienced statistician as well as a<br>um another person in auckland who we<br>collaborated with and so we're working<br>together on that but it's<br>so the breakdown of ages is taken from<br>the<br>pho agreement so it is the industry<br>funding age<br>fans<br>so it's i think it's zero to four and<br>i'm thinking of 65 plus is there a<br>breakdown within there there isn't which<br>is a great point that is not yeah<br>because that's why<br>and the ministry of healthcare<br>no so as far as i'm aware when it comes<br>to the funding brackets it's just yeah<br>65<br>yeah which is really interesting when<br>you think about that<br>the difference between a 65 year old and<br>an 85 year old in terms of needs<br>absolutely yeah so there are some<br>additional<br>sources available for specific programs<br>like long-term condition<br>yeah<br>there are but when you look at these the<br>impacts that things like how user health<br>health card has which you think should<br>be<br>i sounded when i look at that y-axis i<br>think why do we miss a couple of zeros<br>off the end there it just seems to have<br>a very little impact so<br>yeah it'd be really interesting to see<br>if those other smaller pots of money and<br>things like services to improve access<br>equally<br>well that is the problem<br>i just addressed some questions here in<br>the chat and the first one is from<br>bridget i understand that the nurse<br>visit rate is recognized as being an<br>underestimate as many nurse<br>consultations are not captured in the<br>utilization data<br>so that's absolutely true so the nurse<br>utilization data that we use comes from<br>the new zealand health survey<br>and the question that they ask in the<br>health survey is about the number of<br>times you've seen a gp with or without a<br>nurse and the number of times you've<br>seen a nurse but not seen a gp so<br>clearly there is nurse utilization<br>that's not being captured there if you<br>also saw a doctor at the same time<br>so that's a good point bridget thank you<br>and then from alan moffat pretty sure<br>that high user health entitlement<br>includes nurse with it so thank you for<br>clarifying that that's great<br>uh finland is income based<br>the high user health cards it's not<br>income based it's based on utilization<br>as far as i know<br>um<br>from fiona when vlca was introduced it<br>was open to all practices so there are<br>vlca practices with less than 50 eye<br>leads<br>my understanding was when they were<br>introduced in 2006 it was anyone could<br>apply and then in 2009 they specified<br>you must be 50 percent<br>is my understanding<br>thank you<br>from jeremy is there any breakdown of<br>rural funding now that's a really<br>interesting one which i forgot to<br>mention that there are pools we didn't<br>include because we thought either it was<br>so hard to quantify<br>or yeah like a service to improve access<br>it's applied for on each case and yeah<br>i'm afraid rural funding is one we<br>haven't included because these<br>statistics weren't there that i could<br>find to know how many practices are<br>rural<br>so yeah it was it was really hard to<br>from jim i understand this is about<br>primary care however utilization of<br>hospital services et visiting and<br>inpatient admission may also need to be<br>looked at so a fuller picture of the<br>patients using health services can be<br>obtained so that's what we were speaking<br>about earlier thank you<br>um<br>from alan's csc card is income based um<br>so the csc card is not the high user<br>health card that's right<br>the other thing to point out is the<br>utilization for virtual consultations<br>during covert were not initially being<br>captured now this is a really<br>interesting one so we<br>took our data from prior to covert for<br>exactly that reason but um<br>i think that there's<br>there is work going on um not so much by<br>our team but by others uh looking at the<br>utilization of virtual consultations<br>both both phone and um<br>and zoom or video calls so<br>um yeah i think the<br>the funding of that um<br>i think uh<br>is<br>not well understood because it's not<br>captured on a national level<br>um<br>from<br>peter it appears that capitation formula<br>does not take into account the premature<br>and compressed morbidity of marley and<br>pacifica which assumes age is a good<br>measure for waiting for morbidity<br>absolutely i mean that sums up i guess<br>the last hour beautifully so next year<br>thank you<br>um it's absolutely true<br>from a fiona did your research highlight<br>the inequity between vlc and csc formula<br>for the same capped fee<br>um<br>some um<br>so i'm not sure the<br>inequity in funding to the practice<br>which is what we've been looking at<br>so my understanding is the vlc everybody<br>in the practice<br>can only pay up to the capped amount for<br>the community services card as an<br>individual level policy so an individual<br>needs to apply for the community<br>services card<br>and then that is if it's not a vlc<br>practice that is that capped amount is<br>applied<br>to the individual but not practice wide<br>but i'm not completely sure i've<br>answered your question there so if you<br>want to add more into the chat if you<br>want to please<br>yeah can i talk oh absolutely yes hello<br>um yeah when we developed the cnc<br>formula at psapp<br>we realized was a huge inequity between<br>what vlca practices were receiving and<br>what is essentially fee substitute<br>substitution revenue um compared to what<br>they would receive for a csa because<br>when we introduced csc we were<br>effectively buying out the average<br>co-payment of those people<br>so it ended up we ended up with a much<br>larger amount in cse because it was a<br>more realistic buyout of the co-payment<br>value and highlighted how underfunded<br>the blca practices were for the same<br>kept co-payment of 19.50<br>oh thank you is that written up anywhere<br>by any chance so that sounds really<br>really no but i could easily do that for<br>you oh that would be really interesting<br>too thank you<br>yeah i know<br>you're in the crowd<br>just um<br>i was just trying to remember what the<br>utilization has been since that<br>community service can't change and i<br>know we were tracking it for a year or<br>two but it's been lower than the<br>anticipated<br>it was interesting in that change as<br>well the lca doesn't get anything more<br>for under 14s as well so it was taken<br>away<br>a couple of other points here one of the<br>issues we don't capture is su by csc<br>nationally<br>we provide quarterly i suppose it's<br>monthly now i'm not quite sure<br>um reporting to the ministry but it<br>doesn't break down by csc<br>so non-csc<br>haven't been able to track accurately at<br>a national level any increase in<br>utilization associated with reducing the<br>co-payment for csd card as old as the<br>19.50 the one that we were able to trap<br>was when we introduced zero fees for<br>under 14s<br>it was originally under 13s um and the<br>average service utilization was there<br>something like about 1.78<br>per annum for<br>under 13s and when we took put the zero<br>fee it went up nearly up to 2.2<br>wow<br>it's quite a change yeah yeah<br>when we look closely at that it was 2.2<br>not necessarily the population but that<br>policy is trying to affect our memory<br>yeah well that's always the problem<br>isn't it that the policy doesn't<br>necessarily<br>do what you wanted to do what it has<br>done the the um<br>the cse policy i think is to<br>significantly reduce the level of unmet<br>need due to cost for maori but hasn't<br>for pacific people so that's really<br>interesting that it's possibly because<br>specific people are already mainly<br>served by practices<br>which<br>are vlca practices<br>i don't know if you've heard that liz<br>suggested you may have a comment about<br>that but don't don't feel you have to<br>uh<br>add in or not<br>i just feel like i've missed a couple of<br>comments back here<br>from jeremy um current funding models<br>for rural do not work for lots of<br>reasons good point read data recent<br>publishing of geographical<br>classification of health will enable<br>better data collection and support<br>further work just because analyzing it<br>is hard should support more analyzing<br>so great so there any other comments<br>there's no more comments in the chat<br>i think one thing that starts me when<br>you look at the international<br>literature as well and how other places<br>um countries weight their funding and<br>it's not just on asian sex it's on<br>illness um<br>all of them are a lot of them but i<br>think there is a push towards um to<br>weight it by illness or by<br>um<br>yeah illness or condition and that would<br>be my<br>magic wand would be to actually look at<br>it a little bit more end of it just<br>granular it down a little bit to um<br>cases rather than agent sets because<br>that's clearly not a very good indicator<br>we've been arguing<br>with reality<br>adjuster<br>but just bearing in mind that the<br>capitation formula the base capitation<br>formula is the only universal part of<br>the formula so i call it universal<br>funding but actually it's quite quite<br>just a small component of the of the<br>funding that's based on historical<br>utilization rates<br>by age and gender there was no waiting<br>in it for any level of<br>deprivation or health need it's just<br>that's a universal part of it and then<br>they tried to add bits onto it to try<br>and address those other things and they<br>introduced the lca obviously to bring<br>down costs they introduced care plus to<br>sort of<br>address some of the<br>funding that was required to address<br>long-term condition management and<br>various things have happened along that<br>way but it's it's it's just grown<br>topsy-turvy we've tried to sort of plug<br>holes in it we've ended up with this<br>formula that doesn't actually work for<br>anyone anymore and we've been calling<br>for it to be reviewed<br>i think 2018 was when we first started<br>that journey and successive governments<br>have said yes we're going to do this<br>we're going to do that and the latest<br>one oh we're rolling it into the review<br>of the health and disability system but<br>unfortunately it just pushed out the<br>whole process of completely reviewing<br>the way that we fund primary care until<br>now which is great so<br>research is really valuable thank you<br>thank you<br>good to see you so the other point that<br>we should highlight is that this is<br>actually um<br>health systems<br>the primary care funding yes so just for<br>those of you that you're on zoom just to<br>reiterate what liz just said that five<br>percent the primary care funding is<br>about five percent of the vote health<br>budget<br>and which of course is<br>yes<br>hopefully i'd like to thank you all very<br>much for an interactive session it's<br>really great to get interesting feedback<br>and when you give presentations so i<br>appreciate everyone's comments and uh<br>yeah and many thanks again to tessa for<br>all the work she's done and a lovely<br>presentation thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
