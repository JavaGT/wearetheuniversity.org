we're<br>discussing the tanitha of climate change<br>i'd also like to acknowledge tane mahuta<br>so my name is margaret baba i'm the dean<br>of tiakama tuatu the school of science<br>at the university of waikato<br>so this in this discussion panel uh as<br>part of our series on cop26 will cover<br>the intersection of climate change with<br>gender science and indigenous thinking<br>so um as you'll just heard<br>i'm a pakiha and i'm trained in western<br>science which means i'm not<br>at all qualified to cover many aspects<br>of the topics we'll cover today but i<br>have a wonderful panel with me and they<br>are experts in various aspects of what<br>we'll what we'll discuss and um i'm not<br>going to take up too much of your time<br>i'd like to hand over to them<br>shortly but i would like to just start<br>by framing our discussion today<br>i would say to start with that climate<br>change is the most pressing<br>issue<br>around environment for humanity at the<br>moment um humans have altered the<br>biogeochemical cycles on earth<br>um to a point that we're actually now in<br>a new geological age the anthropocene<br>and so um we really can't ignore this<br>anymore and cop 26 is our<br>hope for fixing the problem<br>um<br>the science of climate change has<br>actually been uh<br>well covered and it's completely agreed<br>upon the latest ipcc scientific report<br>makes it very clear that climate is<br>changing that humans are responsible for<br>it and that we are running out of time<br>we need to act now<br>and we need to act in ways<br>that are kind of encapsulated by that<br>funny little um<br>series of words that boris johnson came<br>up with coal<br>cars<br>cash and trees<br>um<br>and so scientists have been saying<br>things about<br>the the coal part the cars part and the<br>trees part for quite some time but<br>they've never had the cash part<br>and that cash part is really really<br>important to help developing countries<br>who aren't responsible for climate<br>change and who are most<br>strongly affected by climate change to<br>actually transition to um<br>the new way of living and working that<br>we need<br>to deal with climate change<br>so as an academic trained in western<br>science i'm deeply embedded in that<br>western philosophy which assumes human<br>exceptionalism and this isn't a<br>philosophy that's shared by everyone<br>around the world<br>but having trained in that discipline<br>it's really difficult<br>for someone for a western trained<br>scientist to recognize the culture of<br>science and how the culture of science<br>has actually contributed to<br>aspects of climate change<br>itself in terms of<br>um<br>progress and industrialization<br>so i think<br>uh we need to shift our way of thinking<br>and we need to shift it towards<br>kaitiakitanga we need as as scientists<br>and as global citizens we need to think<br>about<br>um<br>different world views<br>that<br>challenge this thought of humans being<br>above nature and rather humans being<br>part of nature and<br>um humans approaching<br>um other species but also the land in<br>the in the water in the air with respect<br>and i see that's the way i interpret<br>kaitiakitang as stewardship and respect<br>this is really it's actually present not<br>in those words of course but it is<br>present in the paris agreement in<br>article 7 section 5 when it talks about<br>adaptation to climate change engaging<br>with um indigenous knowledge engaging<br>with indigenous peoples and their<br>knowledge of their local systems<br>to um<br>create new new futures that uh engage<br>with um<br>with respect<br>so this is what we're going to talk<br>about today um<br>i would just finish on one interesting<br>thing that i've thought about it quite a<br>bit lately and that is how we've<br>colonized the atmosphere and so<br>indigenous scholars like um holly jing<br>bakken<br>uh kunai hilu tharman have<br>have written about<br>how<br>the western world has colonized the<br>atmosphere and they've sort of divided<br>it up and privatized it and commoditized<br>it and put it on a on a on a market a<br>shared market<br>in a way that um is quite well colonial<br>for a start but also um<br>not with respect<br>um not with kaitiaki<br>and so this is this is what what i see<br>is the heart of the climate emergency<br>and if we would rather thinking<br>a<br>that is the well-being of the people<br>depends on the well-being of the<br>environment we wouldn't be in a climate<br>of urgency<br>um so i'd like to just stop talking<br>there and hand over to um hamish he'll<br>introduce himself and then share his<br>views on this on this issue<br>the vice president of local government<br>new zealand<br>i'm<br>similarly conscious that i'm a pakia<br>male and as such talking about gender<br>and<br>indigenous thinking<br>might seem a little perverse<br>but what i<br>will say<br>to quote the late great scientist carl<br>sagan<br>science<br>is a way of thinking much more than a<br>body of knowledge and in many ways needs<br>to exist alongside the lived experience<br>of<br>generations that is indigenous thinking<br>when i'm not a mayor i'm a writer and i<br>studied literature rather than science<br>at university<br>and it taught me that parallel systems<br>lead to important truths<br>it's similar<br>to a history um<br>of a major event living us alongside the<br>fiction uh that is written around the<br>historical events<br>there's a truth about the lives of<br>ordinary people that novels and stories<br>and poems at that time reflect that that<br>are absent from the the world research<br>histories<br>you can't simply prefer<br>uh the research history uh because of<br>the the because of the method of<br>research to tell the full story you have<br>to listen to<br>the other voices to get the full<br>picture<br>i want to speak briefly about my<br>experience in the government of working<br>alongside and with matauranga maori<br>you might think from the sturm<br>and drawing around the three waters that<br>local governments are conservative<br>sector unwilling to look at new ways of<br>doing things but i reject that<br>for the most part<br>the local government sector can be<br>nimble<br>progressive and intimately connected to<br>the communities we represent<br>and that<br>of our individual rohi key partners<br>they're geographically defined so other<br>councils<br>i look at uh honganui where te au tupua<br>the uh warner river has a special<br>legislative status<br>uh<br>and that status is actually being<br>broadcast to the world at the moment um<br>as a feature of the new zealand pavilion<br>and the other big global event which is<br>expo 2020<br>the kawa that are embodied in the<br>uh triple legislation are important and<br>i just want to take time to<br>the first uh kawa<br>kotyawa to matapuna or<br>and this is where climate change is<br>folded into the legislation<br>our hour and environs sustains us with<br>life and natural resources and these<br>must be protected from the impacts of<br>climate change so that current and<br>future generations may be nourished<br>that's<br>including physical and spiritual<br>elements are indivisible and climate<br>change responses must be cognizant of<br>the holistic impact on all realms of<br>well-being<br>that spawn is<br>famous saying<br>there is an<br>inalienable connection between people<br>the iwa and the environment and we have<br>a responsibility to change the way we<br>live to reinforce and strengthen this<br>connection<br>uh<br>so a coordinated effort on climate<br>change is required across all<br>communities and authorities given that<br>our our environs are integral to our<br>worldview and lives so they're the<br>now how does that work in<br>reality<br>and i'll give the example of<br>the port development that's currently<br>occurring<br>we're rejuvenating the old port<br>and we're trying to embody<br>the kawa uh in this development there's<br>no sense in rejuvenating port<br>infrastructure but derogating the<br>environment with it<br>so we are operating with an abundance<br>model<br>which needs<br>not to be only economic<br>but also social and most importantly<br>environmental<br>we have a co-governance model uh tipua<br>where hapun and community<br>representatives alongside horizons and<br>the wang industry council and we demand<br>that in the development care is taken<br>not to further degrade the river indeed<br>to reverse some of the effects of past<br>development it's a new way of working<br>and you know there are some skeptics but<br>once you explain to the skeptics that<br>that you are seeking to enhance the<br>in terms of material<br>and<br>and i'll shift to resilience the 2015<br>floods and women who taught us that the<br>civil defense response needs to be both<br>general and specific to tamar went on<br>and so in 2017 we modeled<br>when we had a threatened flood we<br>modeled a very successful parallel<br>emergency operating<br>center<br>and i want to acknowledge here horizons<br>regional council because<br>in february this year uh horizon's joint<br>committee on climate change is formed<br>and is intending to be to model true<br>co-governance the committee is made up<br>of the mayors of the manoa to walmart<br>area and the representatives of the area<br>of the horizons region as well<br>so these are exciting uh moves there are<br>i could go on for a lot longer but i do<br>want to acknowledge uh<br>one of one of the delights of the cot 26<br>is the presence of indigenous leaders<br>pushing for<br>land tenure rights as climate solutions<br>putting<br>pushing for the stories to be heard and<br>i and i want to<br>cite india logan riley<br>from ngati kahanunu<br>who said<br>just yesterday or the day before this is<br>an invitation to you talking to the<br>leaders of the world this is an<br>invitation to you learn our histories<br>listen to our stories<br>honor our knowledge and get in line or<br>so i'll pass on to kipper<br>thank you hamish that was a really good<br>segue into into what i'm going to<br>foreign<br>i am dr kipper morgan<br>and the creator of the modi model<br>decision making framework<br>modi is the life supporting capacity<br>modi binds the physical to everything<br>else that supports life<br>and it enables everything in the<br>universe<br>indigenous knowledge<br>has a unique contribution to make<br>regarding climate change response<br>climate change is one of the critical<br>challenges to our future survival<br>climate change is not being experienced<br>by all peoples in a uniform way<br>the declining mode of our ecosystems<br>and the inappropriateness of practices<br>such as municipal waste creation<br>industrialization<br>agricultural intensification and<br>consumerism<br>have been<br>evident to the maori peoples<br>since before the first waitangi tribunal<br>of particular interest to maori<br>is the modi of fresh water and hamish<br>has already briefed us on that<br>timothy otaway continues to be a primary<br>concern for maori peoples today<br>changes in new zealand policy and law<br>mean that indigenous ways of knowing<br>must now be<br>in<br>included<br>in decision making about fresh water<br>more compelling indigenous ways of<br>understanding and communicating impacts<br>are required<br>the way our ancestors understood our<br>purpose<br>for existence is needed<br>holistic understandings of climate<br>change and solutions that will reverse<br>the declining maori of our ecosystems of<br>origin are needed<br>the understanding of science through an<br>indigenous lens<br>is needed to facilitate a better future<br>for all new zealanders and the world<br>the modi model decision-making framework<br>was created with the intention of<br>assisting with this<br>the contribution of moyo tanga'iwi<br>is important because science in the form<br>it is currently communicated<br>does not have the answers that humanity<br>needs<br>science has provided advances in many<br>areas but it has also facilitated many<br>of the problems now facing humankind<br>i do not believe that science was blind<br>to the potential negative outcomes of<br>its practice<br>but rather that the lens through which<br>the science<br>is viewed and practiced<br>indigenous knowledge provides a way of<br>knowing<br>and seeing<br>that is unlikely to prioritize economic<br>outcomes and reputation<br>more highly<br>than the inequitable outcomes and harm<br>that arise<br>ah<br>reputation more highly than the<br>inequitable outcomes and harm that<br>arises the result of poor choices<br>indigenous peoples have learned to<br>coexist with the ecosystems of origin<br>long before the european expansion and<br>its allied process of colonization<br>arrived in altitude new zealand<br>indigenous peoples have values and<br>beliefs aligned not just to perpetuating<br>their own survival but also aligned<br>towards systems of abundance and mutual<br>benefit<br>in a world being cannibalized<br>by<br>the results are wars<br>ecosystem depletion<br>pollution<br>extinction scarcity disease<br>famine wealth accumulation beyond belief<br>and climate change<br>the current global pandemic might have<br>offered a chance to reset<br>and rework this collectively<br>but trade deals seem to be just as<br>important<br>for some countries at this time<br>it is the quality of perspective offered<br>by an indigenous lens that is critically<br>needed<br>indigenous ancestors have responded to<br>climate change in the same way that the<br>world is today<br>i do not think so<br>the global pandemic has slowed<br>globalization in the global economy but<br>why expend so much effort trying to<br>return it to what it was<br>could the reason be that the decision<br>makers are those that have and will<br>continue to benefit most from the status<br>quo<br>what is needed<br>is decision making based on indigenous<br>epistemologies<br>and actions aligned to the way our<br>tupuna did things<br>maori based ways of knowing<br>being<br>and are the answer<br>to almighty fifiya might<br>find all in the world of light to<br>uh<br>and i currently hold the climate change<br>portfolio for waikato nui<br>so when i was thinking about this<br>session today i thought i would start<br>talking about my tupana<br>as they grew up as kids and they<br>probably knew the best shortcuts to the<br>river to their moana to meet fanonga<br>from another hapu and during these<br>journeys they probably knew<br>which tree to harvest the best cover<br>cover leaves or the best creek to<br>harvest fish<br>or how the sky and the warmth of the sun<br>should look and feel like just before<br>the sun sets<br>or when it is going to rain<br>their tile was their playground as<br>children and they knew how to navigate<br>it to get the best out of it and it was<br>safe<br>imagine a way of knowing your tile<br>where one draws not just on years on a<br>single place but on generations of<br>knowledge over centuries<br>in some other indigenous<br>even thousands of years<br>one where tile is a thing not to be<br>conquered<br>but a relationship and a connection to<br>be nurtured<br>and to be in sync with our tile<br>who when he was a child often knew<br>where people came from from the sweet<br>scent oozing from our people's skin<br>he actually mastered it<br>as that smell often gave away the waters<br>where they bathed<br>oh you're from whangape oh you're from<br>rotuti<br>you're from kimi here<br>but as he grew older the waters started<br>to change and he couldn't<br>couldn't get that scent anymore<br>that recognized where people came from<br>so<br>mataranga has a woman's point and a<br>male's point<br>is there a different traditional task<br>that our people but as as our people in<br>the in both of them do<br>a woman who's a weaver for an example<br>demonstrates generational matadanga<br>through weaving<br>and putting her innovation into the mix<br>which then also gets passed down to her<br>next generation<br>and as a male who chooses a particular<br>to undertake carving all possess<br>different types of mataranga which can<br>provide glimpse and hints into the state<br>of our title before it's even visibly<br>seen<br>that's the kind of knowledge that exists<br>in maori communities and our way of<br>knowing might help us to adapt<br>on the way we treat the place that<br>actually feeds and nurture us<br>which then we can move towards to<br>journey of adapting to climate change<br>we have a relationship with our tile<br>that transcends what we see and feel and<br>is governed by a system of our values<br>and principles that set out how we<br>interact with our tyre around us<br>even maori place names lakes creeks also<br>provide the insights of the quality of<br>place<br>and how that place was used<br>so our 3d three happy within waikato<br>town we used knowledge passed down<br>through generations to observe the stars<br>the shapes of clouds the behavior of our<br>tonga<br>to forecast the weather and to navigate<br>the seas to meet vanonga within the<br>pacific and beyond<br>but today ahapu<br>can't<br>rely on these forecasts because the<br>weather varies more than ever before<br>so signs that used to foretell us to<br>harvest our kai has been based on<br>certain tree blooming<br>or the flying of manu from west to east<br>east to west<br>and there are many more signs that we<br>use but it's been out of whack for a<br>while<br>alma and i have witnessed environmental<br>changes<br>like these for a long time but our<br>observations have often been dismissed<br>or ignored by western science<br>interesting to let you know that<br>indigenous people<br>comprise only five percent of the<br>world's population<br>yet their lands encompass 22 of its<br>surface<br>and 80 percent of the planets die of<br>biodiversity<br>is on the lands where they lived<br>call it coincidental<br>but it's a significant part of<br>traditional indigenous identity is<br>linked to the natural world<br>looking to our te arua where once this<br>nation was described god's best kept<br>secret garden<br>before raupatu<br>it has now been mowed over covered in<br>concrete with soils drying up prone to<br>exotic weeds<br>and that's all in god's garden and the<br>garden has a stench smell<br>we had to fight through councils and<br>court to be heard and finally in 1991<br>the rma actually acknowledged maori to<br>participate<br>we submit our cultural impacts<br>assessments with our mataranga as<br>evidence with good intentions that our<br>mataranga<br>was not to be disseminated elsewhere<br>however we have been told that<br>consultancy agencies and firms hold<br>cultural impacts assessments as records<br>and it is archived without us knowing<br>it is believed that disseminating these<br>traditions can help to address<br>challenges but for us as maori have no<br>guarantee to our cultural values<br>our knowledge and our traditions to be<br>respected<br>that potential pitfall is prompting us<br>to question whether there is a way to<br>share mataranga that benefits our tale<br>i find it to be both risky as well as an<br>opportunity for our people<br>okay matua feel that they like to see<br>to be employed in the right way<br>even when the government taps into a<br>mataranga for input many many of the<br>resulting collaborations don't show<br>respect for the people or the<br>accumulated knowledge that our people<br>possess and is often misinterpreted to<br>suit their needs<br>we know our playground our waterways our<br>is based on the longest generational<br>observation of our taiyo in aotearoa<br>versus<br>n equals five scientific observations<br>we observed these places for generations<br>we know what makes our place tick and we<br>also know when our place is becoming<br>sick<br>we also know what needs to be done but<br>the western colonial world is not going<br>to like it staring into the conversation<br>of cop26<br>it'll be interesting to see if there's<br>any concrete outcome from cop 26 beyond<br>lip service to indigenous peoples and<br>their rights<br>we also debate whether or not to go<br>to the annual cop meetings<br>from a cost benefit perspective and not<br>may not be worth it for indigenous<br>leaders to spend limited funds and to<br>take two weeks away from essential<br>services that are here we are facing<br>today<br>it's trying times for us<br>with covert and combating climate change<br>that requires our utmost attention and<br>even in the best times access to<br>participation in the ewing framework<br>convention on climate change spaces is<br>far from equal whether the negotiators<br>or for civil society<br>observers so global inequalities plays<br>out in terms of who<br>whose delegation is biggest best<br>resource and most able to cover multiple<br>negotiations at the same in<br>marginalized groups and indigenous<br>people and women face particular<br>barriers to participate<br>the gap in cop 26 today<br>is there isn't a session on climate<br>change and health this is a crucial<br>session to be had<br>it would actually show tipping points<br>that have already been tipped usually<br>amongst vulnerable people who are<br>predominantly indigenous people<br>there are lessons to be learnt in this<br>space and also a wake-up call to the<br>next cop that tipping points may not<br>necessarily occur in the western world<br>kia ora<br>um i just wanna just talk all the<br>previous uh<br>um speakers<br>i'm just gonna have to find some time to<br>sit with that<br>um<br>nor england island scotland wales<br>wrigley<br>i am a pakia queer person and i lead the<br>team at waikato environment center<br>which is also known as go eco<br>our<br>our projects cover kai transport<br>biodiversity and enterprise and all of<br>these things intersect with climate<br>change and<br>tea or waitangi<br>i just want to acknowledge that the lens<br>that i am speaking through today is one<br>of tangita territory<br>and that um<br>that we need to<br>uh not so much understand<br>and maori in the first instance as<br>pakiha and tawiwi<br>rather we first need to understand our<br>history<br>and the why of the powers that brought<br>us here in the first place and how we<br>we support hapu to realize kaitiaki<br>tanga and nirarohi etangata we consider<br>it our responsibility to investigate and<br>understand the impact impacts<br>um that's in in systems of power<br>including both capitalism and<br>colonization on our environment<br>identifying as a tangata territory<br>organization is our acknowledgement that<br>we were created as a settler<br>organization and operate within systems<br>of<br>imperial and colonial power<br>every element of this conversation is<br>uncomfortable for us it challenges our<br>white settler vision of history our<br>class version of power and it moves our<br>belief<br>that possession and possessing more is<br>how we value and place people in a class<br>or as a sub-category in a binary system<br>of being not white not male or not<br>heterosexual<br>we know that here in the wire castle 90<br>of our wetlands have been drained since<br>colonization commenced<br>combined with<br>introduced predators and the impact on<br>our indigenous biodiversity has been<br>catastrophic our kahikatea forests are<br>diminishing a combination of climate and<br>the imperial legacy of dominating nature<br>and environmental resources<br>we know that our transport systems were<br>designed by men to keep them to get them<br>to work in a direct way<br>the system was never evolved to include<br>gendered caregiving responsibilities the<br>idea that a parent could take public<br>transport to deliver a child to daycare<br>another to primary school and another to<br>intermediate before going to some<br>part-time work or their community<br>volunteering roles before going to the<br>market in the supermarket collecting all<br>of those children and going home<br>is now<br>just only being considered<br>that queer and trans people might not<br>feel safe traveling alone on public<br>transport there's also new research and<br>it's another thing to consider in our<br>work<br>the thing i want to talk most about is<br>last year we rescued and redistributed<br>on average more than nine tons of food<br>each week mostly in kirikiri<br>with about a ton in surrounding towns<br>charitable food redistribution came from<br>with my ancestors from europe<br>i remember my grandmother organizing the<br>church donations for the needy<br>food banking is a growth sector in new<br>zealand<br>food rescue is a colonial settler<br>solution to the problem of<br>overproduction can never be an answer to<br>food insecurity<br>similarly<br>charitable redistribution of food is a<br>colonial settler solution again imported<br>with our middle class great great<br>grandmothers from victorian england who<br>performed charitable acts to add to<br>their character resume while waiting for<br>modernizing food banking by centralizing<br>and collection and distribution creating<br>rules around accessing rescued food<br>surplus items being donated by producers<br>and the bureaucracies imposed by<br>government funders simply creates<br>additional barriers to accessing surplus<br>or waste food<br>recently at go eco we did an order and<br>we discovered that that we rescued food<br>from landfill and it originated in<br>australia chile ecuador vietnam thailand<br>sri lanka india italy netherlands<br>singapore and switzerland food items<br>that included tin spaghetti cereal gravy<br>mix spice<br>tin tomatoes<br>potato chips cereal bars sunflower oil<br>sauce coffee beans bird seed coffee pods<br>and bananas everything except the<br>bananas was wrapped in an<br>environmentally lethal combination of<br>plastic<br>aluminium<br>foil<br>or card<br>sometimes a combination of all of those<br>things constitute the wrapping to a<br>piece of food<br>abundant healthy food systems do not<br>produce environmentally lethal waste<br>plastic tin and aluminium are not so<br>easily recycled and still contribute to<br>waste<br>food sovereignty takes a closer look at<br>the systems that produce food who<br>produces the food and the environmental<br>impact of that food production<br>this means for us that indigenous and<br>ancestral practices like foraging<br>watercress sharing fruit veggies seeds<br>seedlings with whanau and neighbours<br>or growing your own kaya all important<br>returning to systems which care for<br>papatuanuku and ourselves<br>so what we're starting to look at is<br>indigenising food sovereignty what it<br>means we think it means moving to<br>emphasize cultural responsibilities and<br>relationships that indigenous people<br>have with their environment<br>it also requires<br>supporting the efforts made by these<br>communities to restore these<br>relationships through the revitalization<br>of of those indigenous foods and their<br>ecological knowledge systems<br>and the broad well-being that comes with<br>those it also means that<br>that perhaps the biggest conversation<br>still to come is the conversation about<br>models of land ownership<br>pre-colonial food economies made food<br>available through trade fed entire<br>communities first and traded the<br>abundance<br>this model or these models<br>of of food<br>redistribution reduce the need for tin<br>tuna caught in our oceans shipped to<br>thailand to be produced and smothered in<br>environmentally lethal wrapping shipped<br>back loaded onto trucks transported<br>around the country and then sold at<br>supermarkets before the excess is<br>discarded to landfill<br>i want to also um acknowledge india<br>logan riley<br>um and and what they said which was get<br>in line or get out of the way<br>uh we think that from a tonga to charity<br>perspective this is<br>this is this is our task we have to<br>learn about our impact what we're doing<br>while we provide um well we step out of<br>the way<br>so that maori tangata fenwa hapu<br>can realize their<br>kaitiakitanga because by not being in<br>the way<br>we're creating the space for that to<br>happen<br>and on that note one of the biggest<br>learnings um in this journey for us is<br>tonga tertility while we we unpick these<br>conversations and understand these<br>systems of power<br>is<br>is something that we learnt which was<br>around the doctrine of discovery so<br>again going right back to our systems of<br>power<br>and<br>the learning from that being that first<br>they discover<br>secondly subjugate<br>and thirdly they fund<br>and that is the problematic environment<br>that we're working in<br>within the charitable sector but also in<br>the environmental sector<br>so<br>i'm handing back to<br>margaret<br>you've just reminded me of a whole lot<br>of things i learnt in my first year<br>maori and indigenous studies paper um<br>lots of parallel thinking lots of<br>parallel challenges of our um of our way<br>we look at the world as pakiha and and<br>and realizing that um the way that we<br>look at the world has has really<br>disadvantaged so many people including<br>tangent genoa so kappa i'd also like to<br>thank all of our other speakers of<br>um a lot of us seem to have latched on<br>to um to india logan riley and i did as<br>well i think that that that quote of um<br>get in line or get out of the way and i<br>think it's just wonderful and it<br>reminded me of something lorraine said<br>yesterday on the podcast maybe it's time<br>for the humble trees of the forest to<br>lead the way maybe we need to<br>say well our leaders our biggest trees<br>in the forest aren't doing the job we<br>need we need to do it ourselves um<br>and<br>for me<br>as a pakeha that means exactly like joe<br>said making some space<br>um i love the way that hamish you<br>brought in the personhood<br>and the legal of the whanganui river and<br>the legality and actually putting that<br>into practice that's a wonderful example<br>for all of the world on how we can<br>actually put<br>these environmental controls into place<br>for our shared future<br>and kipper<br>you are quite right that<br>science must have known<br>that it was causing damage and it's time<br>for science to claim that to to to see<br>the privilege and to recognize the<br>privilege that we have um been sitting<br>in and to be part of the part of the<br>conversation of the solution i mean<br>science has taught us a lot about our<br>environment<br>and it will continue to do so but it<br>also has contributed to the problem so<br>um completely agree with you there so<br>now there's a chance for each of our<br>panelists just to respond to each other<br>if they wish and we'll just take it and<br>turn and so i'll stop talking and just<br>invite homer if he wants to make some<br>comments on other what other people have<br>said<br>oh look thank you very much margaret<br>sorry about my internet connectivity i<br>dropped out for about five minutes there<br>i'm back uh for the moment we'll see how<br>it goes look<br>i<br>was just completely inspired by by the<br>other speakers um<br>and i and joe you're so right that just<br>about everything we do<br>uh um is a challenge uh<br>you know our thought processes are a<br>challenge um<br>as uh<br>so<br>it's uh<br>it's something that i'm willing to to<br>take up uh pick up that fuero and and<br>and see where we get to uh but i'm<br>really glad you mentioned uh food and<br>different ways of food resourcing<br>because just yesterday i don't know if<br>this has been reversed but uh<br>regenerative regenerative local kai<br>systems a case for change uh was<br>discussed yesterday at a council meeting<br>um<br>and that's a simple practical thing<br>that councils can make the decision now<br>we don't have to wait for<br>for select committees and legislation to<br>pass<br>councils right around the country can<br>plant trees now can deal with uh<br>supporting regenerative local kai<br>systems now we can we can do the stuff<br>now<br>uh and i think uh something i want to<br>say about uh um<br>the big trees in the forest at cop 26<br>is<br>to have narendra modi saying<br>2070<br>when he'll be about 140 years old<br>when you've got<br>jaya bolsonaro<br>a hideous individual<br>talking about<br>deforestation and in 2030 well that'll<br>give him nine years of if he remains in<br>power to completely denude<br>amazon us<br>so<br>that the sense of now the sense of<br>imperilment uh needs to<br>be addressed and<br>councils can do that<br>alongside and it must be alongside the<br>community<br>wonderful thank you how much keeper<br>like to<br>go<br>um yeah i've really enjoyed the decision<br>uh the different perspectives all seem<br>to be<br>aligning<br>on a common understanding<br>um<br>yeah<br>um water water's gonna be our biggest<br>issue<br>uh<br>i think it's always been a really big<br>deal for<br>um potato fenugree maori<br>um<br>we're starting to catch up with three<br>waters reforms i think that's<br>really going to create some change<br>um<br>i'm a little bit concerned that<br>our territorial authorities are assuming<br>the right to sit at the table<br>i think<br>the issues of water ownership have not<br>been resolved<br>and i think<br>the people sitting at the table should<br>sit at the table because of the<br>expertise<br>that they bring<br>in terms of finding solutions<br>and<br>i think from a territorial authority<br>perspective it may be an assumption<br>that because people are elected<br>uh to be in governance roles<br>that they are suitable to sit at that<br>level of governance for the three waters<br>um i'm not not persuaded<br>that that is automatically the case<br>i was really encouraged by what hamish<br>said<br>i think sure elected members<br>um<br>need to be there to represent the voice<br>of the people but i think<br>concurrently they also<br>need to have the expertise<br>to understand what the real issues are<br>um lorraine i loved your corridor<br>um<br>i would have loved to have said that too<br>or we didn't have time so i'm really<br>glad that you said it thank you thank<br>you very much<br>and joe um food sovereignty<br>um we've we've just launched our our<br>climate change strategy<br>uh<br>and food sovereignty was one of the<br>three pillars one of the main things so<br>i totally agree with what you've shared<br>so thank you everybody<br>i'll pass on to lorraine for her<br>comments<br>sorry lorraine can you unmute<br>always forgetting the button<br>i just wanted to um um<br>congratulat congratulations once on the<br>presentations<br>um and i just want to<br>make sure that um<br>that<br>um<br>everything that you said is what waikato<br>tony is thinking about<br>um and it has it on our list<br>um<br>what we're wanting to<br>invest in is the right investments<br>moving forward with our marae and our<br>people<br>and to get through the storm of climate<br>change and um<br>and<br>majority of the corridor that i<br>this aligns to the corridor that i was<br>talking about yesterday<br>uh is that um<br>you know with with the humble trees of<br>the forest um<br>eluded that he didn't look<br>at the big trees in the forest he he<br>wanted he looked at the humble trees of<br>the of the forest the fresh in the house<br>and so um and the humble trees of of the<br>forest is us the people<br>yeah<br>um so um<br>but i think<br>it<br>the gap in the climate change is climate<br>change and health<br>um<br>and because once they realize the health<br>consequence<br>coming from climate change will probably<br>kick their butts into gear<br>um to<br>to um<br>to make sure that things are going to<br>happen<br>it's all blah blah you know nice words<br>lovely we're going to do this and we're<br>going to do that and you hear that from<br>the global leaders but there's no action<br>behind it<br>um<br>and<br>people getting i think because it's the<br>26th time<br>got 26<br>i think people were just getting a bit<br>annoyed hearing the same old same old<br>with no evidence of action<br>and so for us is<br>maori and i think for indigenous peoples<br>we're<br>getting annoyed<br>yeah and um and i think it's time<br>because this this next decade is going<br>to be very crucial<br>whether we're going to make it or not<br>and as i said yesterday<br>that rather than waiting for<br>the<br>the tall trees of the forest to actually<br>do something about it<br>we start doing something about it<br>the humble trees us as humble trees<br>we are looking at lifelong legacies<br>in waikato tony<br>we want to make sure that<br>i are prepared<br>we have a plan b we want our plan b<br>just in case<br>um things go to craft<br>yeah so<br>we're looking at that that investment um<br>and i would suggest<br>if things are going the way it is<br>is for everyone to have a plan b<br>joe would you<br>i'm cured uh i um<br>i do want to acknowledge and shout out<br>and highly like absolutely recommend<br>people to read both the waikato tainui<br>environmental plan and the waikato<br>tainui climate plan they are<br>resources that we use in our work when<br>we're making submissions<br>and<br>they lay out<br>a really clear vision um and set of<br>actions um for what lies ahead so i i um<br>if she wouldn't do that and also more<br>recently the uh true climate plan um<br>thank you for raising that dr keeper um<br>we have uh been introduced to that<br>through the waikato plan as well and<br>these are these are brilliant things and<br>i guess one of the things that<br>frustrates me and that this goes to what<br>lorraine was saying as well<br>is that lack of action then people are<br>like we need a solution and we go look<br>at these plans some people have done the<br>work<br>um and these plans are great and and<br>they they're there already why are we<br>making another plan<br>um and that is a constant source of of<br>um<br>frustration i suppose<br>um that we have to recreate plans<br>because uh the the plan that the<br>indigenous people that the kaitiaki of<br>that he have developed is never quite um<br>can never just be endorsed and accepted<br>which um<br>which is as a as a puzzle for tonga to<br>tell you to to to work out in the future<br>um<br>and<br>yeah and i think that feeds into that<br>um that ongoing frustration that yeah<br>we're at cop26 what's happening who's<br>doing what um and we need to acknowledge<br>that there are people um in our hee and<br>who are doing the thing every day at the<br>moment to create change and um<br>and total call those efforts<br>and so thank you all<br>i've really enjoyed um listening to you<br>today<br>thanks joe and i think we'll wrap it up<br>there i feel like we've got we all agree<br>the direction we need to travel<br>and i feel like in aotearoa we are<br>from the ground up from the from the<br>humble humble trees in the forest<br>so i just thank you very much all<br>the university of waikato is proud to<br>introduce the world's first bachelor of<br>climate change for the people who know<br>there is no planet b<br>gain the skills needed for the jobs of<br>tomorrow contribute to a fundamental<br>shift in the way we do business and go<br>about our lives<br>explore how matauranga maori can bring<br>perspective to the most pressing issue<br>of our time<br>apply now and carve a career where<br>you</p></main><footer
