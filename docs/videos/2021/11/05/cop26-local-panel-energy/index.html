climate<br>change<br>response<br>that can help to reverse our declining<br>maori of our ecosystems are needed<br>understandings of solutions<br>from those working at the flex routes<br>are important<br>because it is the effective<br>implementation of climate change<br>response that will make a difference<br>we have six panelists today<br>who will share what the local<br>initiatives have been doing to address<br>the impacts of climate change<br>i have asked each panelist to hand over<br>to the next speaker when they furnish<br>and after their contributions we will<br>wana on the collective insights gained<br>so over to our first speaker mike west<br>uh michael west uh<br>as<br>kevin mentioned i'm the chair of the<br>well energy trust<br>um<br>and i've been asked to talk a little bit<br>today about the um<br>the influence of governance on the<br>uptake of initiatives and climate change<br>responses<br>i think the theme being think globally<br>act locally does uh<br>lend itself to needing to understand how<br>governance entities can<br>influence that uh that uptake um<br>the act locally part of it uh<br>can be broken down into some very small<br>sectors<br>in my particular instance the well<br>energy trust is a entity of its own but<br>it does own a significant player in the<br>electricity and energy industry which is<br>well<br>networked so uh<br>so just to give you a little bit of a<br>heads up on what the structure of my<br>organization is the well energy trust<br>was set up<br>to own the shares in well networks<br>so it's 100<br>owner of well networks<br>it has a<br>board of trustees which is elected every<br>three years<br>and the board of trustees has<br>a<br>governance role to<br>run its own entity<br>under the guidelines put down in the<br>trust deed<br>uh one of the things that the trust deed<br>is fairly uh strong honors that<br>a core responsibility of the trustees is<br>to ensure that it's the company that uh<br>that it owns runs as a successful<br>company<br>and uh we've interpreted that to not be<br>just as a financially successful company<br>but also in<br>environmentally and socially successful<br>companies so<br>so the impact that we have as a<br>governance group within our own entity<br>does flow on to<br>our ownership of well networks<br>so basically well networks is our core<br>investment<br>uh as a standalone initially we also<br>have non-core investments so<br>also keeping with the theme of<br>of climate responsibility we<br>we had a significant amount of money<br>under investment<br>and we insist that those investments are<br>both ethically<br>responsible and sustainably made<br>investments<br>we're a philanthropic entity and we have<br>uh<br>responsibly to income beneficiaries<br>we're able to make community grants and<br>impact investments and by<br>utilizing our powers within those<br>those areas we can<br>have some influence over<br>initiatives that we see as being<br>both worthwhile in terms of how they<br>return financially but also how they<br>return to the to the greater good of our<br>uh<br>one thing i know about um governance is<br>that<br>it has to be done in a reasonably<br>moderate sort of a way and it's always<br>controlled by<br>it's important not to be too extreme<br>with your with your uh direction as a<br>particularly as an elected trust as<br>elected representatives uh we're acting<br>every three years and naturally we um<br>we do need to meet the expectations of<br>our electorate<br>and<br>what uh what we've seen in the past and<br>probably the future is if we're too<br>extreme in our in our uh direction we<br>will get<br>changed for a uh a newly elected trust<br>so um we have to have<br>regard to our beneficiaries in in more<br>than just one area<br>owning well networks<br>is um obviously the<br>the area that we can contribute<br>significantly to in the climate change<br>arena<br>uh our own entity the well energy trust<br>is has a very small carbon footprint<br>we're a um<br>just a small office we've got six<br>trustees five staff we don't run a fleet<br>of vehicles we work out of an office and<br>what have you however<br>well networks although in itself it's<br>not a massive carbon footprint<br>it does have<br>has some ability to<br>reduce its contribution<br>but<br>in its role as a network provider it's<br>able to future proof and to provide<br>support for<br>new technologies that are coming on<br>board which are much more focused on on<br>large-scale carbon reduction<br>the<br>exact couple of examples of of where<br>we're at um<br>so first of all in terms of our<br>structure we appoint the board of<br>directors for well networks<br>and uh the relationship between the<br>board and the trust is one where we have<br>a letter of expectation every year<br>which is um<br>works within our our owner's expectation<br>manual which is our relationship with<br>the formal ratio between the trust and<br>the company<br>and within that document we<br>one of the things we specify is a um is<br>reporting on on carbon emissions and uh<br>and the like so<br>we're a little bit limited and what we<br>can do we're not able to provide any<br>influence on the way the companies run<br>that is something that the directors<br>have to provide<br>and of course they are controlled by uh<br>company law<br>and numerous other uh requirements the<br>electricity authority the commerce<br>commission and and various other<br>entities uh all looking in to see what's<br>going on at that<br>level<br>in terms of um<br>how<br>we're<br>encouraging our company to be a little<br>bit supportive or<br>quite supportive in that arena is<br>encourage them to invest in an energy<br>related investments which can provide<br>benefits both<br>financially and have an impact on<br>on climate<br>reduction or climate carbon reduction<br>uh recently um well networks purchased a<br>company called infratec now infotech is<br>a uh<br>is a company that specializes in large<br>solar and battery uh technologies<br>and they're already using that to put<br>into play an investment in a bess which<br>is a battery energy storage system so<br>it's a large scale battery the<br>particular one that they're<br>going to invest in shortly is 33<br>megawatts<br>and what that will do is it will have<br>the ability to<br>to take electricity from uh<br>renewable<br>wind and solar and then store them to be<br>used at times when there are<br>addition to that the company has just uh<br>threw it through infotech it's<br>subsidiary has just received a contract<br>to build a solar power<br>station for a company called lodestone<br>energy which is<br>basically going to be building<br>solar generation which will service<br>around 55 000 households so that<br>that's an area where the company is is<br>lending itself to supporting<br>infrastructure or supporting the<br>the ability of<br>the generation of renewables without<br>actually being in the market itself um<br>from its own perspective the company<br>has undertaken a few initiatives for<br>instance its uh<br>ev electric vehicle uptake is um it's a<br>got a program where it replaces vehicles<br>it looks for ev options unfortunately in<br>some of its fields there's no electric<br>uh<br>vehicles that are able to be<br>sourced because they're just not being<br>made<br>one of the initiatives it has done is<br>it's converted a lot of its uh<br>um<br>sort of bucket vehicles which are the<br>big trucks that go out on the road and<br>and<br>the workers uh go up in the elevated<br>buckets previously they used to be<br>operated by the diesel motor of the<br>truck that would run and power the<br>hydraulics so they could be working with<br>it now they have upgraded them so they<br>can drive them to the sites and they can<br>turn the engines or turn the motors off<br>and run with electric uh powered<br>hydraulics so<br>just just small initiatives like that<br>which are sort of within their uh well<br>within their capacity but mostly from<br>the larger scale they are doing it by<br>way of feature proofing and supporting<br>the<br>the change in how we're generating power<br>all right so that's all from me for now<br>thanks mike i am andrew bidder i'm an<br>architect i build lifestyles i build<br>communities and i build for the future<br>my track record includes the 2020 master<br>builders award for the country's most<br>sustainable house so i am making a real<br>difference<br>today we are talking about energy so my<br>focus is on how buildings use energy the<br>new zealand context is very different to<br>the top 26 panels we heard from this<br>morning<br>most of our energy is renewable hydro<br>not coal oil and gas so we need to chart<br>our own path<br>copying overseas policies is not going<br>to deliver carbon reductions to the same<br>extent<br>here<br>so let's start with the basics<br>sustainable is defined as meeting the<br>needs of the present without<br>compromising the ability of future<br>generations to meet their own needs<br>applying this to buildings we can see<br>that any new building that can be used<br>by future generations is therefore by<br>definition sustainable<br>in new zealand we are required to design<br>for a minimum building lifespan of 50<br>years<br>we also have a growing population we<br>need more buildings regardless of energy<br>use<br>so global policies that punish new<br>zealand for growing compared to say<br>japan or germany which have declining<br>populations<br>is going to create more problems than<br>salt<br>this leads into<br>carbon accounting because<br>we've got to define the issues and<br>measure the issues properly in order to<br>be able to<br>solve the problems<br>and overseas figures<br>typically quote<br>around 40 of carbon dioxide coming from<br>buildings<br>where is this figure from<br>i found plenty of boats but no sources<br>the new zealand context where our<br>electricity is from hydro<br>means that that 40 figure is wrong for<br>new zealand<br>if we stick with that sort of thing then<br>we are going to end up driving bad<br>policy as a result<br>this is why<br>understanding at the deeper level is<br>important<br>when we look at a factory that uses a<br>lot of energy to make something<br>is it the factory building<br>or the product that is using the<br>energy in reality we have to look at who<br>is the carbon end user<br>and an example of this would be<br>a factory making solar panels it might<br>be using a lot of energy as a building<br>to make the solar panels is the factory<br>good or bad<br>you'd have to say that if it's producing<br>solar panels it's good<br>we could cut production here<br>reducing the energy use of factory<br>buildings but that would send factories<br>and jobs to say china instead our<br>emissions go down theirs go up is this a<br>good result<br>this is the sort of policy question we<br>need to be analyzing<br>so how do we set<br>good targets and good policy<br>the new zealand energy context is to do<br>things like avoiding the gasified uh<br>huntley power generation for peak loads<br>here i say we need to flatten the curve<br>not the covered curve the energy curve<br>for this we need to consider the<br>difference between residential houses<br>and commercial buildings<br>residential buildings<br>primarily use their energy for space<br>heating and water heating<br>in the evening and at night<br>commercial buildings are predominantly<br>using their energy for air conditioning<br>cooling not heating cooling<br>this is because<br>solar gain during daylight hours<br>is the problem<br>i'm going to share my screen and show<br>you see a beautiful building this is the<br>type of thing that<br>architects use<br>to sell projects it's a beautiful<br>computer rendering<br>looks lovely people get excited<br>here's the reality<br>blinds down<br>to stop too much glare from the<br>overglazing too much heat gain<br>and it looks a mess<br>lines are a good low energy solution but<br>it is not the image that was sold to the<br>client<br>here is some good architecture shading<br>is integrated as a design feature it<br>adds value<br>and<br>just<br>pause for a moment and so get my<br>drive back on<br>so other considerations apart from just<br>shaving are things like roof reflectance<br>painting a commercial building's roof<br>white<br>so that reflects the solar gain and will<br>reduce the heat buildup and<br>our industrial buildings in particular<br>tend to use metal roofs<br>if we paint it white we can reduce<br>the conduction of heat from the outside<br>to the inside<br>we can also add more insulation in this<br>case it's the stop<br>uh<br>heat gain from outside the building as<br>opposed to residential where we're<br>stopping heat loss from inside the<br>building we can look at natural<br>ventilation of offices more efficient<br>air conditioning plants<br>solar panels on the roof for immediate<br>use<br>because if it's being used during the<br>day unlike residential it does not need<br>storage for human use and battery<br>storage is a problem<br>so how do we drive good policy<br>some options are legislation building<br>the only answer is education<br>legislation and tones<br>simply complicate things there are too<br>many different users too many different<br>needs<br>too many<br>localized environmental requirements<br>for instance i'm currently designing a<br>medical center where parts of the<br>building need sheltered air they cannot<br>have natural ventilation<br>so people need the knowledge to decide<br>for themselves<br>that's the core<br>policy driver education<br>not control<br>there is no need for incentives because<br>good decisions that save energy<br>save money<br>uh thanks andrew um<br>antenna corto uh my name is garris<br>catrich i'm from the community energy<br>network<br>that network is<br>has community enterprises<br>the network's been around for about 20<br>years and over that time<br>my members have probably done<br>in the order of three hundred thousand<br>healthy home assessments<br>and um<br>for around about 120 130 000<br>insulation and heating retrofits<br>primarily through the warmer kiwi homes<br>program but<br>a number of other uh<br>providers there if uh or partners rather<br>have allowed us to<br>do that work uh about two or three years<br>ago we<br>uh added<br>our strategy uh to our strategy and and<br>we're getting into the community energy<br>sector um and it's very much a sector<br>that is<br>uh lagging behind uh countries that we<br>would normally benchmark ourselves<br>against to europe australia and north<br>america<br>um so that's kind of forming the the<br>basis of where i'm coming from um i'd<br>just like to<br>uh<br>agree with a lot of what andrew just<br>said there um<br>at one point from an energy hardship<br>point of view and how the how how does<br>energy hardship interact with our<br>emissions reduction<br>and transition work<br>uh we're actually looking at a<br>uh a peak in emissions required in the<br>next few years we've probably got the<br>facility of<br>100 150 000 homes in new zealand out of<br>the roughly 1.8 million<br>um that are in desperate need of deep<br>retrofits to get the home to a livable<br>standard<br>um<br>we have over 2 000 on a normal year at<br>least we have over 2 000 people die<br>every winter<br>unnecessarily because of the quality of<br>their homes and over 40 000 children go<br>to hospital every year because of the<br>quality of their homes so<br>uh those people<br>uh and there's another group of probably<br>about three four hundred thousand homes<br>above that<br>uh that are right on the cusp of causing<br>those issues as well<br>and if there was a drop in income in<br>those homes then they would be in that<br>space as well<br>and i'm sure many of us have lived in<br>those homes maybe when we were flatting<br>so<br>those people in those homes who are<br>struggling to survive<br>are not remotely interested probably and<br>in climate change they don't have the<br>time or the energy to be interested<br>uh in a in a transition or being<br>resilient or taking a different type of<br>transport option<br>so<br>i think we need to get real a little bit<br>with the discussions that we're having<br>um we need to<br>make sure that our foundation for how we<br>make this transition is solid and one of<br>those is we need to pick up<br>considerably on on issues like quality<br>housing before we can even<br>talk about some of this other work<br>um<br>i would just like to<br>reference a little bit what's going on<br>at the moment with cot 26 but also with<br>the<br>emissions reduction plan that the<br>government's um consulting on at the<br>moment<br>um there's a real need for us to all<br>understand or be on the same page about<br>and there's a lot of good guidance uh<br>internationally around what that is uh<br>there is no working definition<br>from what i've seen uh from our<br>government on what equitable means<br>um and if people do want to have a look<br>at what i think is a really good uh<br>definition is a<br>the international energy agency have<br>set up a global commission on<br>people-centred clean energy transitions<br>and that just released a report just to<br>hear the cop 26 that has 12 principles<br>um recommendations for for what that<br>transition looks like<br>and it's excellent and and i think<br>if<br>our government and our communities are<br>looking for a shortcut uh to<br>putting something in place that we can<br>all uh work towards then those 12<br>principles uh<br>would be great<br>um i guess where i'm<br>leaning here is that we need a there's a<br>systems change required um across a<br>large<br>well pretty much every sector um<br>my focus is on on housing and energy<br>i think<br>we need to have<br>we need to catch up basically uh<br>internationally we need to catch up on a<br>community energy sector<br>and the key element there is that a<br>community energy<br>a proper one<br>is one where we've got an engaged<br>society in energy<br>i'm not sure how many<br>people we get we know who can read their<br>energy bill well<br>for example<br>uh our energy literacy is very low i<br>think our understanding generally of how<br>our energy sector works is very low and<br>for good reason it's complex<br>so not wanting to sort of whitewash that<br>too much<br>um<br>so<br>we need to be able to the collectively<br>we need to work out how we can<br>communicate how we can educate<br>how we can support our whanau our<br>families<br>to<br>understand<br>how their homes work and how energy<br>works<br>and what are the best ways that they can<br>interact with it to reduce the demand<br>but also increase the performance of<br>what's going on in the home<br>i think<br>another key element to that engagement<br>piece is<br>ownership and ownership of problems but<br>also ownership of the opportunities<br>so that's part of that systems change in<br>terms of how<br>the broader community can interact<br>with the energy sector<br>um there's not many ways that can be<br>high degree of understanding of how the<br>sector works before you can interact<br>with it<br>so<br>we need opportunities the communities<br>need opportunities<br>to interact with it i think our<br>financial models need to change in terms<br>of how we<br>see investment<br>there's been a big push for impact<br>investing recently<br>um but a lot of the impact investors<br>i've talked to still want a 15 return<br>um and if we're going to make genuine<br>changes on environmental and social<br>benefits by either impact<br>then that 15 return probably needs to<br>they need to change the horizon quite a<br>bit and understand<br>that if we're going to hit those impacts<br>we need to<br>reinvest we need that money to be<br>invested in the communities in those<br>environmental outcomes<br>um<br>so i think there's a there's a big push<br>here required by government and by local<br>government um but i'm also<br>quite keen on the idea that communities<br>demand those solutions uh to be led<br>locally as well i think uh it needs to<br>both be flex routes and top down at the<br>same time<br>um i think that's the only way we're<br>going to get the<br>the uh<br>the speed the urgency that we that we<br>desperately need<br>um<br>i think that's probably the<br>that's probably my five minutes up um i<br>could talk for an hour on that<br>uh<br>so thank you hopefully we have a good<br>discussion later i think i'm handing<br>over to stefan<br>yes good day<br>good day everyone my name is stefan<br>hoybeck i'm a research engineer with the<br>national institute of water and<br>atmospheric research here in hamilton<br>i work in the area of aquatic pollution<br>which means i am researching wastewater<br>treatment systems and plants farm waste<br>management systems and monitor<br>the impact of aquatic pollution on<br>aquatic environments<br>and<br>i want to<br>take up the discussion here a little bit<br>uh broadening the focus and uh basically<br>uh focus your attention a little bit on<br>the fact um that everything is connected<br>in the world of energy and greenhouse<br>gas emissions<br>and that we have a monumental task in<br>our hand in those remaining 30 years<br>until 2050.<br>um<br>the<br>one of the core issues is that<br>energy and greenhouse gas emissions are<br>sometimes hidden uh sometimes they hide<br>in plain sight other times they're<br>they're really hidden and really out of<br>sight out of mind<br>um<br>we heard a lot about<br>electricity renewables<br>from previous speakers and quite often<br>this is<br>simplifying energy to mean only<br>electricity<br>whereas electricity is one area of<br>interest it is an important one we need<br>to make<br>greenhouse gas progress in the<br>electricity area but it's only one<br>subset of the energy sector which is<br>only one subset of uh industrial and<br>processing<br>greenhouse gas emissions which is again<br>only a subset of overall overall<br>greenhouse gas emissions<br>and maybe to illustrate the magnitude of<br>the problem we are faced with um i can i<br>hope i'm allowed to throw a few numbers<br>around<br>um<br>i um<br>would like you to have a think about uh<br>the number of two percent<br>of all the energy that mankind is<br>utilizing being fed into the harbour<br>bosch process to synthesize<br>atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogen<br>fertilizer<br>most of you probably have heard about<br>nitrogen fertilizers but not about the<br>enormous energy requirements that have<br>fed into these processes<br>we use these fertilizers to increase our<br>agricultural production ultimately that<br>nitrogen feeds into our food system<br>and being in our food system at some<br>stage it will end up at the wastewater<br>treatment plant<br>where we again<br>um<br>use a lot of energy between two and five<br>kilowatt hours per kilogram of nitrogen<br>to purify the water and essentially um<br>feed oxygen to bacteria so we can<br>convert that nitrogen where we<br>previously expended energy for uh up<br>into the atmosphere again<br>um and in the process again uh causing<br>secondary uh greenhouse gas emissions in<br>the form of nitrous oxide where we don't<br>even know um you know how large that<br>contribution is um if you look at<br>you know inventory numbers we're usually<br>talking about<br>estimated<br>emission factors<br>um<br>so<br>coming back to this whole concept of um<br>think global act local i think this is a<br>a wonderful example<br>where we can see that um a lot of our<br>energy consumption a lot of our<br>greenhouse gas emissions are coming from<br>areas where we wouldn't expect them to<br>come from<br>and where we simply cannot afford to<br>ignore local solutions<br>or um can afford to let off the pressure<br>at the big global players at the big<br>industrial processes<br>to to demand change so for one thing we<br>need to become in this area of energy<br>for fertilizers we need to become more<br>nutrient deficient<br>we need to use less of it we need to<br>think about um getting um renewable<br>energy sources at an industrial scale<br>fed into those uh existing processes be<br>that uh green hydrogen be that biogas be<br>the biomass<br>but even more so we need to think at the<br>local level of uh how can we um<br>minimize this um craziness going on that<br>we<br>first expand energy to fix nitrogen and<br>then expand more energy to unfix it<br>again um we need um<br>concepts um where we take some of these<br>nutrients from waste streams<br>uh convert and purify them and recycle<br>them back into local agricultural um<br>production systems<br>and and basically bypass some of these<br>um double looping<br>um quite often<br>these changes will cause<br>secondary problems we will um you know<br>basically rely on other inputs we will<br>require more machinery<br>sometimes we may cause other greenhouse<br>gas emissions but of course there are<br>also other examples where solving one<br>problem<br>can<br>also have secondary benefits and to give<br>you a bit more hope that's a role doom<br>and gloom um some other<br>areas we have been working at was around<br>the<br>energy<br>self-sufficient dairy farm in a new<br>zealand context<br>and that is based on um basically<br>capturing future different methane<br>emissions from farm and your management<br>systems<br>we have a couple of example sites<br>from waikato down to<br>southland<br>where we have<br>dairy farms that basically have<br>retrofitted quite simple systems<br>uh to capture methane emissions um<br>from the farm<br>manure management systems from the<br>affluent ponds<br>um and they capture this methane they<br>run generators they generate hot water<br>and<br>basically for the larger farms we have<br>achieving 50 60 70 energy sales<br>efficiency um is possible<br>um and this is really something where<br>you get um you know two birds with one<br>stone you um you know harness renewable<br>energy while also reducing fugitive uh<br>refund emissions so the examples exist<br>uh um<br>for both scenarios where we have<br>synergistic benefits of<br>improving our ways and there will be<br>other examples where<br>we're stuck<br>with solving one problem by creating<br>another one<br>um<br>lastly i i just want to want to say that<br>um<br>2050 30 years from now<br>is a<br>very short time frame<br>and um because of that short time frame<br>to reach greenhouse gas neutrality<br>we cannot afford to<br>exclude any options and to<br>descend into turf wars we cannot dismiss<br>localized small scale initiatives like a<br>solar panel on your roof like the<br>partially energy self-sufficient dairy<br>farm<br>like a you know district nutrient<br>recycling system and we cannot afford to<br>dismiss this at the same time<br>people at the grassroots level people in<br>government<br>cannot<br>afford to<br>demonize and exclude whole industries<br>um we<br>cannot afford to expand<br>all the raw materials all the skills or<br>the knowledge we spend building up a<br>fossil fuel industry we cannot ignore<br>that completely it is about reusing uh<br>some parts of it reusing the skills<br>reusing the talent in those industries<br>for example um in new zealand we've<br>decided to um<br>end the production of fossil natural gas<br>um correct step um we cannot afford to<br>pump more petroleum products out of the<br>earth and uh<br>keep on<br>emitting fossil co2<br>but that expects the question what are<br>we doing with our natural gas pipeline<br>system um we have the technology we have<br>the resources to produce biogas<br>and reuse some of these um<br>assets that we already have um and<br>hopefully come to a greenhouse gas<br>neutral or lower greenhouse gas scenario<br>that way faster than by excluding<br>everyone and and descending into turf<br>wars uh in trying to rebuild the utopia<br>uh from scratch for which we certainly<br>don't have the time and certainly won't<br>have uh the resources the natural<br>resources not a talent for<br>so um yeah i just want to leave you with<br>that thought and um yeah pass on to<br>holly<br>ah kiara thank you stefan<br>i'm tina koto katoa i'm holly snape i'm<br>from community waikato we work with<br>community and social service<br>organizations across the waikato region<br>and we support them to strengthen<br>organizational capacity we facilitate<br>networks and community conversations and<br>we provide training and development to<br>the sector<br>so i'm going to talk from a community<br>perspective today i want to make it<br>clear i certainly don't speak for all<br>community but i'd like to share some of<br>my thoughts based on my observations of<br>being involved in the community sector<br>at both the governance and operational<br>level for the last 20 years or so i was<br>also really excited by what gareth was<br>saying and has caught it all i certainly<br>think um that reflected our observations<br>in the community and social service<br>sector too<br>i think for many local communities<br>there's recognition that climate change<br>is a significant global issue but the<br>reality of responding with tangible<br>tangible solutions can feel<br>quite out of control for low-income and<br>marginalized communities it can be a<br>tension between members of low-income<br>communities meeting basic needs and<br>prioritizing environmental outcomes jane<br>goodall has said it really well when she<br>said to fix the environment you need to<br>fix poverty and this is a reality for<br>many of our communities<br>the incentives to reduce emissions and<br>move to sustainable or cleaner energy<br>sources are targeted at people with<br>financial means to access them so what i<br>mean by this is many of the solutions<br>proposed provide incentives for those<br>who can afford them but penalties for<br>those who can't so for example<br>governments propose some excellent<br>incentives around those purchasing evs<br>while the cost of petrol edges higher<br>and buses can be a great way for people<br>to navigate our cities without a vehicle<br>for workers um with pretty standard day<br>jobs but they're not a good option for<br>our local nurses or orderlies working<br>night shift or for cleaners who are<br>often cleaning offices overnight but it<br>isn't all doom and gloom<br>local communities are finding some<br>really innovative local solutions to<br>provide long-term sustainability<br>in terms of what's happening at a<br>grassroots level we're seeing some<br>fantastic disruptive technology the<br>design of our towns and cities has<br>traditionally favored car culture and<br>while evs might be a solution for those<br>in our community who have been able to<br>afford them and that is great they don't<br>disrupt that driving culture and provide<br>a range of alternative solutions<br>e-scooters have quite literally changed<br>the culture of how a significant number<br>of people are now getting around our<br>city and that cultural shift is what<br>needs to happen if we want to get people<br>out of cars<br>solutions like that they need to be<br>really well supported by our local<br>government as well to make their usage<br>safe for them and for pedestrians alike<br>local infrastructure needs to support<br>that ship to accommodate the uptake of<br>e-scooters and the infrastructure<br>updates will no doubt support more<br>cyclists and pedestrians to get out of<br>their cars<br>however if we even look at the reaction<br>to the living streets trial that we had<br>um on a couple of roads in hamilton<br>recently the evidence um to the pressure<br>businesses and drivers put on local<br>government to continue prioritizing that<br>car culture is of a concern<br>but alongside infrastructure and<br>accommodation that accommodates various<br>ways to navigate communities<br>buses like i said can be a great<br>solution but they can also be quite<br>expensive for people on fixed incomes<br>or people with minimal disposable<br>incomes<br>poverty action waikato recently started<br>circulating a petition through action<br>station calling for council to make bus<br>rides free for students for community<br>service card holders and for people<br>under the age of 25<br>challenging our car culture providing<br>those disruptive technologies and<br>providing affordable alternatives i<br>think it's a crucial part of grassroots<br>solutions to climate change<br>but another area that's been of critical<br>importance has been around food<br>sovereignty and food security community<br>gardens marae gardens pataka kai food<br>rescue locally being undertaken by<br>coivolution these are all grassroots<br>solutions giving community access to<br>healthy food options<br>the fact that property has been getting<br>smaller and rentals less secure has<br>resulted in families and whanau<br>struggling to feed themselves from their<br>own gardens not to mention the cost of<br>setting them up and how time-consuming<br>they can be which is hard for<br>single-parent families or people working<br>long hours<br>sharing community-based plots for food<br>growth and distribution has been a good<br>supplement to individual households and<br>to the community food network<br>which is an area we're seeing growing<br>scale across the region<br>in terms of community organizations and<br>what they're doing to review their own<br>contribution to climate change we have<br>seen a progressive shift over the last<br>10 years or so where groups are taking a<br>lot more responsibility for recycling<br>and reusing um for trying to go<br>paperless all of these sorts of things<br>um a lot of it's driven you know by cost<br>for the fund for the not-for-profit<br>sector and certainly recycling and<br>reusing products works for us really<br>well but community houses and our<br>planning and planting community<br>gardeners are gardens and partnering<br>with local communities to tend the<br>garden for their own benefit as well<br>we've seen excellent models of waste<br>minimisation uh organizations like the<br>seagull center and thames and extreme<br>zero waste and raglan<br>and these organizations have now<br>actually been used as templates for<br>others around the country somehow<br>community organizations are seeking to<br>understand their own energy use better<br>to make better energy decisions recently<br>we had an opportunity given to us by<br>trust waikato who engaged uh toy to<br>envirocare to survey some waikato<br>community organizations gathering data<br>around things like flight and<br>travel electricity use rubbish etc<br>and then toitu provided a report that<br>demonstrated the patterns of energy use<br>and fuel was really significant but it<br>was interesting because i think it been<br>any other year than 2020 it would have<br>looked far worse and it would have<br>included a lot more air travel<br>but of course we couldn't do a lot of<br>that uh in 2020<br>but the evidence regardless was still<br>really clear that the way our<br>organizations individually and<br>collectively use vehicles in particular<br>is a real problem<br>those findings are driving conversations<br>now about what we might be able to do as<br>a sector to reduce fuel consumption and<br>demonstrate leadership in that space it<br>looks like you know sorts of things<br>we're talking about a shared fleet of<br>electric cars possibly a partnership<br>with company is like a lime scooter<br>equivalent with electric cars maybe<br>making better use of public transport<br>certainly ride shares hubbing all of<br>these sorts of things the reality is<br>that data that has given us insights<br>into the extent of the issue and that<br>can help drive some of those innovative<br>solutions<br>so finally i think local communities<br>absolutely must be part of the solution<br>to climate change<br>but it's essential to consider how we<br>take everybody with us addressing issues<br>of food security and transport needs are<br>fundamental to being able to bring<br>people along on a journey of change if<br>people's primary needs are met they can<br>start to consider what is beyond their<br>immediate need and if the solutions also<br>align with more affordable alternatives<br>to the older energy heavy ways of living<br>then we will actively engage these<br>communities in the fight to address<br>climate change<br>um<br>that's me i'm going to pass back to you<br>kippah<br>kiara thank you holly<br>um and thank you to our other panelists<br>mike<br>andrew<br>gareth and stefan<br>i'm going to<br>throw it open to all of our panelists<br>now just to<br>reflect on their presentation<br>and how it um resonates with comments<br>made in in the other presentations i<br>think i heard the word um or not the<br>word collaboration<br>but i was hearing that it's going to<br>take a collective response<br>and that it'll take decision making in<br>the different areas that we influence<br>uh working together to get<br>these results we're looking for so<br>i've got a i've got a couple of points<br>here that um<br>sort of i think respond to that<br>um one was in i was having a<br>conversation with the electricity<br>authority yesterday and they were asking<br>um the question how<br>how did they um<br>increase energy literacy and<br>and those sort of things and i said my<br>answer to them was they don't uh we do<br>you know the communities do the people<br>in the communities<br>um<br>and yeah it goes back to education and<br>behavior change and those sort of things<br>and my point to them was that<br>we need to treasure or value<br>the organizations that we have<br>throughout i'd say all of our<br>communities that people trust<br>that they know and understand<br>you know are saying to them<br>quite often<br>our guys might go in and say you need to<br>do a retrofit you know you need<br>insulation heating blah blah but it's<br>not until the final order navigate it<br>goes in after<br>and says hey you need to look at this<br>and you need to also change the way that<br>you uh<br>live in your home and it's easy and it's<br>quick and and they keep coming back and<br>keep saying the same thing and that's<br>what creates the change that's what<br>that's the that's the secret source um<br>and there's no<br>fast tracking there um and so those<br>organizations that we have in our<br>communities that people trust<br>um are incredibly valuable and i think<br>they've been undervalued for a long long<br>time um and under-invested for a long<br>time<br>uh i think they're the agents of change<br>that we need um and and they need to<br>sort of<br>get bigger and better at it um the other<br>point i'd make just reflecting on what<br>stefan<br>was saying is<br>you know we've got a pilot out at raglan<br>where hopefully over the next set of<br>five years we'll have five to ten<br>megawatts of community-owned<br>solar and maybe wind or<br>um<br>put out there and<br>you know i was just reflecting on you<br>know you're talking about uh the farming<br>sector and quite often we have this<br>rural urban<br>um<br>buffet you know disagreements uh the<br>media feel that quite often<br>and i think when we're talking about<br>rural communities you know like raglan<br>and lawrence all the media we all know<br>them<br>um we can't have that<br>we need to understand how farmers and<br>the local communities interact with each<br>other and you know ideas like that<br>biogas one where 50 of their energy can<br>be generated on site<br>um you know<br>we could be having solar farms that<br>agreed pv solar farms on some of these<br>uh sites as well<br>so the farmers can engage in the local<br>solution um in the<br>urban people in that in that area can<br>see how the farmers are engaging this<br>kind of breaks down perhaps some of<br>those barriers that<br>that people have<br>um<br>yeah i think we just need to um we need<br>to explore how those<br>relationships can be um strengthened up<br>considerably at that local level<br>exactly gareth exactly gareth and i<br>think there's also<br>an aspect here of<br>risk spreading<br>that at the moment you have your typical<br>dairy farmer who knows that 95 of his<br>milk product will be exported overseas<br>at the same time we have a petroleum<br>industry that's importing 8 000 million<br>dollars worth of petroleum every year<br>and<br>everything coming from overseas so um<br>yeah we we wouldn't be better off if we<br>you know would minimize our export<br>dependency in one area and uh reduce our<br>import dependency in another one by<br>having you know energy solutions on<br>farms um by uh you know<br>broadening the products that a farm is<br>producing does it all have to be milk or<br>can't it be<br>you know 10<br>energy um<br>that dries the process or you know if a<br>farm is applying the milk to a dairy<br>factory why can't it also grow the trees<br>to fuel the boiler and to dry it into<br>milk powder um<br>this would be beneficial from uh<br>ecological point of view you know<br>thinking about water pollution it's uh<br>better from you know our climate point<br>of view and uh also from an employment<br>point of view<br>because you will<br>have new employment opportunities for<br>um your people that manage those systems<br>in those rural areas there will be jobs<br>in portuguese it will be jobs in<br>in<br>stratford<br>not everything<br>centralized in one refinery up in<br>northland<br>yeah yeah look i think the<br>age of local is coming you know the the<br>centralized approach is uh<br>um<br>works at economies of scale that um have<br>caused a lot of the problems that we've<br>got uh so we're needing to sort of<br>almost revert back a little bit you know<br>back to the future here a little bit in<br>terms of<br>some of the systems that we're going to<br>need to develop local rather than<br>centralized<br>uh the other point i just wanted to make<br>and it might have been something that<br>jeff uh<br>would have said earlier<br>is uh this idea of distributed energy um<br>kind of flies in the face a little bit<br>uh with the current current government<br>thinking around lake onslaught in the<br>national battery you know having a<br>massive lake as a as a battery for the<br>for the grid<br>um our approach is that distributed<br>energy so energy generation and storage<br>that's on the grid edge in these rural<br>communities<br>increases the resilience of the grid<br>considerably<br>and we're really keen for that to be a<br>genuine scaled<br>idea for the<br>you know the whole country you know we<br>should be talking about<br>gigawatts of distributed energy on the<br>grid edge provided the grid can handle<br>it of course and so storage becomes a<br>big issue there<br>um but yeah i i think it's it's a<br>considerably more resilient<br>um<br>option<br>and<br>i think resilience is<br>my at risk of being an overused word<br>like sustainability i think it's going<br>to be fairly critical for us to<br>get our heads around what that means<br>i think one of the<br>one of the issues around storage picking<br>electricity storage if you're looking at<br>batteries for instance there's a lot of<br>the<br>economic model that's needed to support<br>batteries is the energy trading<br>schemes<br>and<br>they start to fall over when<br>the amount of storage uh grows it's<br>obviously a supply and demand type of a<br>thing so<br>um naturally uh you know in a situation<br>where you've got uh you know directors<br>running companies they're looking making<br>and making investments<br>uh they have to be able to weigh up the<br>economic returns as well as the other<br>returns<br>another thing i'd like to bring up as<br>well is the is the the car culture it's<br>interesting the car the car culture and<br>uh<br>and holly mentioned that in hamilton<br>they recently trialled some um<br>some innovating streets projects<br>uh it's obviously built around the idea<br>of um<br>getting people out of cars and getting<br>people<br>onto other forms of transport um<br>but i feel that one of the area that's<br>been that's been ignored there is the um<br>is<br>and i think the byproduct of trying to<br>do that is that you've created a<br>environment of congestion car congestion<br>where the car drivers are basically<br>being put under pressure they're being<br>squeezed and they're hopefully with an<br>outcome of being look i'm sick and tired<br>of the of the difficulty it's taken me<br>to get from point a to point b in my car<br>i look for an alternative but i look at<br>it from a sort of a um a more<br>mathematical and engineering perspective<br>where i say<br>if you were in a bottling plant and you<br>wanted to um<br>to get a better outcome you look at say<br>getting the bottle from the point a to<br>point b<br>faster and get the product into the<br>bottle more quickly and so<br>with another strategy in the uh<br>the car culture side of it be to try and<br>actually improve the flow of cars rather<br>than stifle the flow of cars so that the<br>journey time is reduced by 20 for<br>instance and that a good example i see<br>is the opening up of the expressway<br>between hamilton and auckland where<br>uh the stretch of road that opened up<br>part of the drive reduce the travel time<br>by around 20 minutes and if you multiply<br>that by 100 000<br>trips a day it becomes a lot of<br>reduction in emissions you know so those<br>things in themselves as an investment do<br>have a positive outcome about the other<br>side of it<br>i would suggest though that that still<br>works within an environment um<br>where the population is a particular<br>size it doesn't actually<br>change the problem where the emissions<br>are still occurring i think for example<br>about spending time in hong kong which<br>obviously has a much larger population<br>but navigating getting around that city<br>it's one of the easiest experiences i've<br>ever had in my life of anywhere and it's<br>a city that is invested significantly in<br>an alternative way to get people from a<br>to b and i tell you what they do that<br>fast too<br>you're not standing for more than three<br>minutes before you're on a train and you<br>could be from kowloon to the center of<br>hong kong inside five minutes it's<br>absolutely um incredible way to get<br>around the city and i do think that when<br>we look at innovating cities around the<br>world cars are a part of yesterday's<br>technology and that there are other<br>technologies coming that are far more<br>efficient<br>and energy efficient<br>holly um everybody's had a say and um<br>i've really enjoyed hearing the<br>different perspectives i think we could<br>probably keep discussing this because<br>there are a number of um issues that<br>i guess seem to be pulling us in<br>different directions<br>but at the at the foundation of the<br>whole thing i think we're all looking<br>for the same outcome<br>so it's really good that um<br>some of the lesser-heard voices have<br>come through today um thank you holly<br>and um and gareth and uh andrew was also<br>promoting i think um a different<br>position as well as stefan and within<br>the governance level mike um good to<br>hear about the battery<br>um<br>the battery storage and the supply side<br>of incentivized changes<br>that well's looking for i think there's<br>still a little bit more work to do<br>before we're all on the same page<br>but i think it's our different<br>approaches that are going to get us<br>there as we<br>each<br>the different things that are<br>influencing our thinking so that we can<br>work through those issues and and find<br>the solutions um one of the things that<br>occurred to me stefan um when you were<br>talking about um<br>your comment<br>and donut economics came to mind and<br>then i thought okay what about donut<br>energy cycles<br>and um one thing about donut economies<br>and that is about decentralizing<br>and and actually containing uh<br>containing those processes so that it<br>gets so large<br>that they then dominate<br>uh the endpoint because of their own<br>objectives<br>but um<br>thank you everybody i've i've enjoyed um<br>hearing your different perspectives and<br>um it's seemingly quite an eclectic<br>group of opinions but i think we're all<br>striving for the same outcomes<br>and um something i did here was the<br>importance of the flax roots or the<br>grassroots<br>um<br>coming along on this or actually driving<br>this because<br>it doesn't really matter where we are we<br>haven't got people coming with us on our<br>journey<br>we're not going to get there so kiara<br>thank you everybody um<br>i'll just close us out<br>and wish you<br>the rest of a good day<br>so<br>um<br>now what that means is bind all in the<br>world of light to everything else<br>um<br>a saying that was provided to us by<br>homai tafiti and<br>it really means we've got to think more<br>broadly than just the economics<br>and the things that are immediately in<br>front of us<br>and we've got to bring all the other<br>considerations<br>one of the things that grabbed me was<br>um i guess doing things more<br>intelligently and working together<br>but<br>also allowing<br>um<br>a<br>equitable transition to<br>different fuel sources and that gareth<br>talked about and then holly picked up on<br>as well<br>so<br>um<br>so what i'm getting at there is these<br>ideas of<br>flex roots grassroots initiatives<br>community<br>trust<br>working collectively together i think<br>these are older ways of doing things<br>that have been lost to an extent with<br>our<br>our current<br>world that tries to work really fast but<br>doesn't work as efficiently<br>maybe we've got to go back to those ways<br>held by our ancestors<br>thank you everybody<br>enjoy the rest of your day<br>the university of
