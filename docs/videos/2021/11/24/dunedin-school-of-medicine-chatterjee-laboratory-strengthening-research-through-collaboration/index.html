of<br>otago in department of pathology we are<br>based in dunadine school of medicine our<br>works on epigenetics so<br>the fundamental unit of life is a cell<br>and every cell has the same genome<br>but every cell is different skin cells<br>are different to blood cells blood cells<br>are different to muscle cells so the<br>question is what makes them different<br>although they have the same dna letters<br>and it is because of the epigenetics<br>it's an instruction manual to the cell<br>so<br>it's a on or off signal<br>that actually provides how our genes<br>will function within a cell<br>and in cancer the on off signal goes<br>wrong and our lab is trying to<br>understand<br>why they go wrong and where are those on<br>and off signal in cancer cells and how<br>i think collaboration is really a key<br>part of the lab because we're working on<br>a very cutting edge area we combine<br>molecular tools with computational tools<br>to answer the questions in epigenetics<br>that we're asking<br>we really want to take our discoveries<br>from the lab to the clinic to help<br>patients and the only way to do that is<br>by collaborating nowadays everyone is<br>very specialized not everyone can do<br>everything in the lab so you really have<br>to seek out people you can work well<br>with and who have skill sets that can<br>complement your own i require active<br>collaborations with groups locally<br>nationally and internationally<br>for example we may take samples from a<br>group in the uk<br>and we can process them here and the<br>dissemination of the results it goes to<br>all of our collaborators and<br>to the wider scientific community we<br>value each individual and the different<br>expertise that they bring<br>we value collaboration with people<br>locally but also overseas within our lab<br>we have students that are<br>junior trainees owners masters and phd<br>students who are more mature<br>in their research journey sort of bring<br>our best expertise together and actually<br>i think the main thing for any science<br>scientist undertaking research is that<br>they want to be able to research what<br>they like and what they understand while<br>also applying it to real world scenarios<br>so luckily with my project in the<br>chatterjee lab we're looking at a<br>colorectal cancer which is quite<br>prevalent in new zealand and it's quite<br>prevalent among the maori community as<br>well so hopefully if we develop this<br>method of early detection we'll be able<br>to save a lot of lives<br>a lot of studies have shown that there<br>is a correlation between the stage of<br>the cancer and the survival outcome if<br>you generally detect in stage 1 the<br>survival rate is around 95<br>i am working in something called as<br>circulating tumor cells<br>so these are cells that break away from<br>the main tumor and they go through the<br>blood and they that's what causes the<br>spread of cancer so these cells have the<br>capacity to study the tumor status and<br>has the potential to be developed as a<br>marker for early detection what we're<br>hoping to do with liquid biopsy is they<br>can just have a blood sample taken send<br>that off to the hospital and they can do<br>tests on that so what that would do is<br>it would really reduce the sort of<br>burden that the current biopsy practices<br>have on patients in terms of biopsy of<br>cancer a lot of time people have to come<br>into like a big hospital and it's quite<br>a painful procedure especially if they<br>don't have cancer it can be a bit sort<br>of a bit futile and we think that would<br>be easier for doctors because you don't<br>have to you know go in and do a whole<br>biopsy on a treatment which will be<br>quite deep<br>i'm currently in my second year of phd<br>and i'm working with targeted epigenomic<br>editing in melanoma cell lines so for<br>using targeted epigenomic editing i'm<br>using a novel<br>cutting edge technique called as a<br>crispr dcas9 system and i'm also using a<br>lentivirus<br>method for you like transfecting the<br>crispr component into my melanoma cell<br>lines<br>along with this in order to achieve my<br>objective we are also using a very new<br>and advanced technology called as cut<br>and run<br>which is very advanced in new zealand so<br>being in otago provides that opportunity<br>to have access to different new<br>technologies and also being in<br>chattanooga lab we have the opportunity<br>to get exposed to all the new techniques<br>and technologies that can help build a<br>very good project and thereby benefit<br>as a new research student i found it<br>really reassuring that i was joining a<br>really supportive team everyone's from a<br>like diverse background like with<br>research and like where they come from<br>and everyone's like at different stages<br>at their careers and research but we're<br>like all working towards like the same<br>goal we do lots of events like secret<br>santa and all that sort of thing<br>we also go for a lab lunch every single<br>time it's someone's birthday which is<br>quite nice<br>we also have pathology happy hours so<br>the whole department will get together<br>and it's just a really good opportunity<br>for all of the students to get to know<br>their supervisors a bit better as well<br>as other people in the department i've<br>really enjoyed my time here it's a<br>fantastic lab environment<br>students are always really supported and<br>i've always found<br>an environment that pushes me and<br>challenges me<br>don't be scared from a new experience<br>don't be shy be confident<br>apply your ideas present them<br>and if you and don't feel shy to ask for<br>help because people are really not<br>judgmental if you ask for support you<br>will definitely be directed to the right<br>direction there are very good facilities<br>provided here and this department in<br>pathology here is is<br>one of a number of very active research<br>departments in the university and these<br>days the facilities that are available<br>you know the resources to do the work<br>are actually pretty well developed and<br>also there's the support to encourage<br>new incoming phd students and to advise<br>them on the way they should be doing<br>stuff so i think<br>for all of those reasons this is a very<br>good environment for postgrads to come<br>and<br>study<br>the journey of research is<br>challenging it could be really<br>challenging at times but i think the key<br>thing is to really identify your passion<br>for research what is that you want to<br>chase and once you identify the passion<br>for research then there is platforms<br>there is support there is people<br>to support you through this journey so<br>that you can walk on that pathway and<br>achieve anything you want</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
