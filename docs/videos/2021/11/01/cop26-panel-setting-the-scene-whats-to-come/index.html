stories<br>share discussions and hopefully to help<br>progress the urgent action that is<br>needed as cop<br>this morning we were welcomed and<br>blessed by our kaumatua taki tuna and we<br>also heard from vice chancellor<br>professor neil quigley<br>margaret evans former mayor but very<br>very active citizen<br>and during which she acknowledged the<br>commonwealth human ecology council<br>with whom we are partnering with to<br>produce this forum over the next two<br>weeks<br>we also want to honor the work also of<br>zena dash who was very instrumental in<br>the leadership of kik<br>as i said the commonwealth of human<br>ecology<br>council<br>this afternoon we have a great lineup of<br>speakers for you all from scientists to<br>local body counselors<br>to our own<br>uh professor tom rohr as well so we're<br>going to come from a variety of<br>disciplines to share our thoughts with<br>you in our short time<br>first up though we are very honoured<br>that we have with us<br>honorary nanaya mahuta minister of<br>foreign affairs and local government<br>associate minister for maori development<br>and of course our mp here for houdaki<br>waikato<br>we are fortunate<br>that she has created the space to give<br>us a short<br>little courted or in summary from a<br>government perspective<br>and if there's a couple of things i'd<br>just like to say about nanaia apart from<br>her credentials incredible credentials<br>of whakapapa in genealogy and her time<br>in<br>in local government is the fact that<br>we heard this morning about being local<br>action and being globally informed and i<br>think if there's one person that<br>epitomizes that that's you nanaia you're<br>very rooted in the flex routes in midair<br>politics of your ewe let alone other ewe<br>you're tested against the reality of<br>what's happening there in the global<br>world as well as the tests within your<br>own community<br>all the time you're uplifting and<br>breaking down barriers to reduce those<br>inequities that you set us all in<br>particularly in terms of the mighty and<br>indigenous communities we welcome you to<br>i'm pleased to join in this online forum<br>associated with the commencement of cop<br>26 hosted in glasgow this year<br>thank you to the university of waikato<br>and in particular tom brewer for the<br>invitation to join the opening ceremony<br>i want to also take a moment to<br>recognize that we are at an important<br>important point in the world's history<br>i want to acknowledge<br>other panelists who bring their<br>particular experience and insight to the<br>discussion that we're having over this<br>two-week period<br>i've been asked to offer some thoughts<br>and set the scene regarding climate<br>change the new zealand context and also<br>our international commitment to lift our<br>ambition to meet the paris agreement<br>goals<br>leaders around the world are calling for<br>action but we have a significant role to<br>play to ensure that words and actions<br>reflect the level of concerted effort to<br>tackle global emission<br>and transition towards a low carbon<br>economy<br>our young people around the world are<br>also calling for action when i think<br>it's evident<br>that they're calling for a sense of<br>urgency and action on climate change<br>after all they'll inherit the decisions<br>we make<br>while we may only be a comparatively<br>small contributor to global emissions we<br>are a food producing nation<br>and we're surrounded by the blue ocean<br>continent<br>sea level rise will impact our way of<br>life and those of our pacific neighbors<br>getting products to market tackling<br>methane emissions and taking a<br>resilience-focused approach to<br>adaptation must be a core part<br>of our domestic priorities as we take<br>meaningful steps forward<br>this must be a decade of delivery<br>across all major emitting sectors across<br>the globe we need to make clear there is<br>a place for multilateral support to<br>achieve this goal and that's what cop 26<br>is setting out to achieve<br>while acknowledging each country's<br>different national circumstances<br>we will endeavour to work together in<br>each sector including through public<br>private collaboration<br>and by mobilizing finance at scale to<br>make the global transition to a clean<br>economy faster lower costs where<br>significant gains can be made while<br>making solutions to adaptation more<br>affordable<br>and inclusive<br>new zealand is taking action to reduce<br>global emissions<br>ensure fair and equitable transition of<br>our economy and build climate resilience<br>both at home and abroad<br>we're fully committed to the paris<br>agreement and intent on keeping the<br>limit of 1.5 degrees warming within<br>reach to prevent the worst effects of<br>climate change<br>especially for the most vulnerable<br>countries<br>it's important to recognize that as a<br>country of the pacific our<br>responsibility to advocate for greater<br>ambition will also support our pacific<br>phenomena the pacific nations who are<br>disproportionately impacted by the<br>actions of developed nations<br>i want to acknowledge our prime minister<br>jacinda ardern and minister for climate<br>change james shaw<br>they've stewarded through important<br>decisions that align our domestic focus<br>decisions<br>like the just transition to ensure that<br>the economic benefits of technology<br>enhancements support food production<br>alternative energy sources resilient<br>infrastructure and planning solutions to<br>support<br>our international efforts<br>new zealand has stepped up our increased<br>and increased our climate finance<br>commitment to 1.3 billion in grant<br>funding over the next four years between<br>2022<br>and 2025.<br>this is more than four times the size of<br>our 2018 commitment of 300 million<br>at least half of the total climate<br>finance commitment<br>is to go specifically towards supporting<br>pacific island countries and at least 50<br>to adaptation<br>new zealand's national circumstances and<br>emissions profile present opportunity<br>and challenge for reducing emissions<br>the updated ndc announced yesterday<br>expressed a target to reduce net<br>emissions by 50 below gross 2005 levels<br>by 2030<br>this equates to a 41 reduction on 2005<br>levels using what is known as an<br>emissions budget approach<br>we've put in place the architecture to<br>manage our transition to a low emissions<br>and climate resilience economy<br>our approach is underpinned by science<br>independent advice from the climate<br>commission<br>a strong focus on stakeholder<br>consultation<br>and ensuring a fair and equitable<br>transition<br>we've set a 2050 target based on ipp<br>pathways<br>our 2050 target covers all gases<br>splitting them based on science<br>this is reflected as an absolute<br>percentage reduction for biogenic<br>methane and net zero for all other<br>guesses<br>new zealand is mapping those long-term<br>targets into short-term action<br>by may 2022 we'll have set out our<br>domestic emissions budget out to 2035<br>and our first emissions reductions plan<br>this plan will outline tangible policies<br>and measures that will enable us to meet<br>our budgets and targets<br>with a particular focus on transport<br>energy and industry<br>the emissions reduction plan will also<br>serve as new zealand's long-term low<br>emissions development strategy and will<br>be communicated to the unfccc<br>in two stages the first stages now<br>complete<br>we will probably be the first country in<br>the world to price agricultural<br>emissions<br>from 2025 at the latest<br>we're working in partnership with the<br>primary sector and maori via herwaka<br>to establish the best way to do this<br>i want to acknowledge mighty food<br>producers many of whom are leading the<br>change towards regenerative farming<br>practices<br>and this builds on the intergenerational<br>perspective of kaitiakitanga<br>i want to acknowledge our academic and<br>research institutions that champion<br>research and development<br>to reduce agricultural emissions<br>this includes through<br>the global research alliance on<br>agricultural greenhouse gases of which<br>new zealand is a founding member<br>new zealand is the first country to<br>introduce legislation requiring<br>mandatory climate related finance<br>disclosures<br>in the trade space<br>new zealand is leading an approach where<br>the alignment of trade and climate<br>policy development through initiatives<br>such as<br>the agreement on climate change trade<br>and sustainability and ongoing advocacy<br>for fossil<br>fuel subsidy reform<br>climate resilience is also a core<br>building block of our approach last year<br>we published our first comprehensive<br>national climate change risk assessment<br>to help new zealand identify and<br>prioritize action<br>we are now in the process of developing<br>our first national adaptation plan<br>responding to the risks outlined in this<br>assessment<br>as we listen to the signals at cop26 in<br>the uh in the coming weeks<br>from the international community i'm<br>sure and i'm mindful that we must make<br>climate change relevant to the people<br>here at home and in our communities<br>we need a cultural shift<br>for people to understand how pressing<br>how urgent the need for change is<br>with cultural change comes behavioural<br>change<br>and with that we can harness kiwi<br>ingenuity<br>innovation our capacity to innovate and<br>integrate bicultural values can they aid<br>more divergent solutions<br>to the challenge of limiting the impacts<br>on global warming<br>in closing i'm aware that the approach<br>taken by this government goes beyond<br>tackling climate change alone<br>our ambition is to catalyze the growth<br>of markets jobs and economic development<br>globally for clean technologies and<br>sustainable solutions<br>support the achievement of the un<br>sustainable development goals strengthen<br>the climate resilience of our societies<br>and realize<br>multiple co-benefits such as cleaner air<br>water and better health<br>climate change requires us to think<br>about how we practice kaitiakitanga as<br>stewards<br>rather than simply consumers<br>maori have a unique perspective about<br>kaitiakitanga and connectedness to one's<br>life force<br>it is holistic and integrated<br>it is immediate and intergenerational<br>it is physical and intangible it is<br>complementary just as night joins day<br>the concept of all life forms is drawn<br>from a sacred essence that is best<br>and i wish you well for the rest of the<br>hui<br>giveaway<br>so in my thanks to nanaya just to thank<br>her again for her time and a clear<br>articulation of the framework that the<br>government intends to work under i think<br>in these times of uncertainty it's very<br>important and significant for us to hear<br>very clear<br>messages and nanaya has helped frame our<br>discussions to come as well as as inform<br>us with a lot more from the policy<br>we turn in now to our second speaker<br>emirates professor ian douglas from the<br>university of manchester uk<br>a world authority in terms of cities and<br>built environment<br>and has expanded into broader issues<br>of ecology and it's about to release a<br>book where he's also looking at<br>mangroves<br>i think that originally he trained as a<br>geomorphologist<br>and and so he's a scientist of<br>considerable repute we'll turn now to<br>hear his discussions and his words to<br>help us along and on our thoughts and as<br>i said help us progress our<br>deliberations in action for cop 26. turn<br>in now to you emirates professor<br>good morning i'm talking to you from a<br>wet and windy uh northeast western part<br>of the united kingdom where two days ago<br>uh this was the scene in one of our<br>towns in the lake district the wettest<br>part of england where they had had 250<br>millimeters of rain in 24 hours<br>this is<br>one of the<br>consequences of<br>climate change the topic we're<br>discussing at this meeting i am ian<br>douglas i am an emeritus professor of<br>physical geography from the university<br>of manchester<br>and i've been concerned with<br>the environment<br>and human action on the earth's surface<br>for a long time<br>these people here are having to<br>adapt to climate change<br>you can see that the river was breaking<br>its banks<br>two days ago but you can see on the<br>right hand side what adaptation means<br>for these people in the last 10 years<br>they have had their houses flooded at<br>least three times by storms that<br>previously would have each been<br>described as a one in hundred year<br>storm<br>this is the increasing severity of<br>extreme events which we've seen the<br>whole world experiencing<br>look at these shutters here that they<br>put across the door and the windows of<br>the houses to protect against the flood<br>waters and we'll be seeing a lot more of<br>this in the coming years if<br>cop26 does not deliver what we're all<br>hoping for out of them but it's not just<br>cop 26 that has got to be involved in<br>working for<br>mitigation of an adaptation to<br>climate change<br>this<br>slide has a couple of graphs on but<br>really i want to explain how i got to<br>thinking about climate change<br>the first<br>uh slide that<br>the diagram on the left here is the<br>atmospheric carbon dioxide<br>contribution from 1900<br>to the present<br>and you could see it going up steadily<br>in the first half of the 19th century<br>plateauing there during the second world<br>war when a lot of activities were<br>constrained<br>and then rising far more quickly up to<br>the present time and that's my long<br>lifetime here since the 1930s and so i<br>have seen<br>this change<br>early in my<br>life<br>in the 1940s and 50s i can remember the<br>concern was air pollution<br>sometimes playing rugby in london<br>this fog stopped us playing if you<br>kicked the ball too<br>hard it would disappear up the pitch<br>into the fog and you wouldn't know where<br>it was<br>in the 1950s<br>we had a clean air act we changed the<br>technology we stopped burning coal in<br>houses and the air got cleaner we can<br>overcome<br>environmental problems if we take<br>concerted action<br>now<br>the right hand side here<br>tells us that it's not just a carbon<br>dioxide<br>this graph<br>shows how the actual emissions<br>changed from the predicted emissions<br>if<br>they were like carbon dioxide close to<br>the predicted commission but predicted<br>emissions they would have followed<br>roughly along the zero line but methane<br>gas<br>which is very powerful gas although it's<br>not very long lasting in the atmosphere<br>is rising enormously and of course that<br>comes<br>from<br>natural gas and from<br>livestock particularly from cattle and<br>that has an implication for each of us<br>in what we decide to eat and how<br>we use<br>our resources<br>now<br>me i personally<br>wrote a book in 1981<br>about the urban environment and it was<br>full of things about flooding and air<br>pollution and<br>so on it didn't particularly<br>in 1987 i was invited to a very uh<br>exciting<br>seminar week-long seminar in the united<br>states on the earth as transformed by<br>human action and there<br>climate change and the<br>atmospheric gases were discussed very<br>seriously and we already had the<br>movement towards setting up the<br>ipcc the inter-parliamentary committee<br>on climate change now<br>in 1992<br>we had the second major international<br>conference on the global environment<br>and<br>after that<br>i received a letter<br>from zena dash from the commonwealth<br>human ecology council a body i had not<br>heard of before<br>asking me to help in setting up<br>a workshop<br>prior to<br>a post<br>rio de janeiro 92<br>meeting on the global environment which<br>cena had attended<br>and this was the uk's response to the<br>setting up<br>of<br>local agenda 21 a movement for<br>towns and cities local communities to<br>improve what they were doing to improve<br>the world environment and at that<br>meeting there was a very interesting<br>discussion by a man who was arguing that<br>we should<br>allocate<br>resources<br>and limits<br>on emissions according to<br>the world<br>co2 emissions per capita which are very<br>very different from one country to<br>another i think at the time australia<br>had the highest level of co2 emissions<br>per capita i'm not exactly sure the<br>figure but it might have been 15<br>whereas in<br>india at that time it was something like<br>point two or point three<br>very much different<br>and so it's inequitable in a way<br>to say<br>that everybody should cut at the same<br>rate<br>those with the very highest per capita<br>emissions should be cutting much more<br>and that debate<br>goes on<br>and<br>was part of the background to<br>my contribute small contribution to the<br>ipcc second assessment in 1995<br>where we<br>wrote about humanist set human<br>settlements<br>the<br>mitigation of the global effects which<br>include effects on health effects on<br>global warming the urban heat island<br>effects on flooding effects on<br>biodiversity and so on so<br>gradually<br>climate change was becoming a very major<br>concern in all aspects of examining what<br>was happening to the world surface so we<br>have the climate change<br>not as a<br>one thing<br>affecting our lives in towns and cities<br>but as on top of all the other<br>environmental damage that was being<br>driven by towns and cities<br>the<br>causing of flooding by the paving of the<br>earth's surface<br>the<br>effects on human health from the air<br>pollution that was happening within the<br>city the effects on biodiversity of the<br>changing of the plants and animals in<br>the city and so on<br>now<br>this<br>is<br>where we have to recognize that what<br>we're talking about<br>at climate change is not an isolated<br>problem it's a problem that is part of<br>our continuing<br>human transformation of the earth<br>now<br>before<br>the cop<br>in copenhagen<br>in 2000<br>in seven<br>i was asked to prepare<br>a report<br>on climate change flooding and the urban<br>poor in africa<br>action aid is a major charity and it had<br>focus groups in<br>the<br>informal settlements<br>the squatter settlements<br>in<br>african cities in the commonwealth<br>and they reported back<br>on how people in those settlements<br>adapted to the flooding that they were<br>already experiencing and we produced<br>document that was used to lobby<br>uh<br>the<br>groups<br>at the top and this had some effect at<br>least i was able to<br>find a report about this<br>in<br>uh<br>the newspaper<br>and<br>this is the way<br>in which we have to be aware that<br>climate change<br>is not<br>socially uniform in its impact<br>the weakest and poorest people<br>the people with the greatest<br>disabilities are going to be affected<br>more than the people who<br>are<br>uh<br>uh in the well-off suburbs and so on<br>so<br>my<br>gradual<br>recognition is that now we are reaching<br>a major ups turn<br>as the this curve shows in overtime in<br>consideration of the impact of climate<br>change<br>now<br>it's people like zena days who i have<br>mentioned and who has inspired people<br>like margaret evans and i to<br>really get involved in these issues<br>she<br>used to<br>influence strongly<br>as many prime ministers she could get<br>hold of<br>and here she has persuaded the minister<br>prime minister of sri lanka in 1985 to<br>sign a message<br>of support for her promotion of human<br>ecology and people taking individual<br>responsibility for the human environment<br>she<br>was invested with the cnzm in london in<br>about 1999 and your university confirmed<br>the doctor<br>of<br>this<br>person<br>has showed me how to think<br>about<br>where<br>responsibilities lie<br>and we're only going to cope<br>with the climate change we've brought<br>upon ourselves<br>by litigation<br>now<br>mitigation<br>means reducing out emissions<br>cutting out the use of fossil fuels<br>avoiding uh deforestation and the<br>burning and emissions that come from<br>that and all those sorts of things that<br>cause<br>the climate to change<br>adaptation<br>as you saw<br>in the opening slides of cockermouth is<br>the preparing for and creating<br>resilience to combat the effects of<br>climate change<br>this<br>is<br>uh going on all the time<br>now<br>other kinds of actions are being taken<br>but i'm so suspicious of<br>the<br>um<br>carbon offset taxes and things like that<br>because we they are not really<br>producing the change in behavior which<br>we will all have to submit to to really<br>get the emissions down<br>it's paying money for someone to plant a<br>forest somewhere else so that you can<br>continue taking long flights or you<br>continue to continue to<br>burn oil this this is not really the<br>answer<br>we have to stop burning oil and we have<br>to stop emissions<br>so<br>we need to have action of the thought<br>that's going to happen in glasgow<br>agreements between nations the sharing<br>of responsibilities and resources<br>particularly financial resources between<br>nations and particularly the assisting<br>those in need<br>the people<br>on the low-lying oceanic islands the<br>people in the crowded deltas<br>like those of the mekong and<br>the gandhi's brahmaputra in asia<br>we need all that international<br>collaboration at the national level<br>we must have the instruments to make<br>sure the targets are achieved<br>support green technology<br>and encourage change in agriculture and<br>industry a shift the shift it's taking<br>towards<br>electric motor vehicles has to be<br>greatly shifted but we also have to<br>think about do we all<br>need the car all the cars we have i have<br>neighbors with three or four cars on<br>their paved over front gardens one<br>paving over front gardens is not good<br>for climate change two<br>having all that<br>metal and<br>materials in the cars just standing on<br>the driveways is not good either neither<br>is driving them<br>so we have to think of that as<br>how national policies can influence that<br>local government needs to be empowered<br>to do what many mayors want to do to<br>green their cities to green housing and<br>to green transport<br>and in the households we must make sure<br>we've got effective insulation so we<br>don't have to use excessive heating or<br>air conditioning we have to have low<br>energy design we have to build we know<br>how to eco-design houses<br>we need it to be mandated in the<br>building regulations and we need have<br>our own sustainable lifestyles so these<br>are all the things that ought to be<br>coming out and i hope you will see in<br>the next fortnight from<br>glasgow so<br>my message is<br>let's think of<br>measures<br>like greening cities<br>like bringing nature back into the<br>cities<br>that's better for biodiversity<br>better for your own and everybody else's<br>physical and mental health<br>it's better for your local diet<br>government<br>sorry your local environment and the<br>global climate so i hope<br>you will<br>continue the efforts you're already<br>making you're obviously concerned<br>because you you're coming to this these<br>seminars but<br>we must persuade other people to follow<br>the examples<br>of the leaders who are urging us<br>to green cities to cut emissions and<br>improve the world i hope you will enjoy<br>these discussions<br>we will all learn from them and i hope<br>that what we try to communicate from<br>check<br>in our daily reports<br>to the to you in the mornings will be<br>useful to you good luck for a very<br>successful seminar<br>that was great professor<br>ian douglas emeritus professor at that<br>thank you for your insights thank you<br>for your vast experience that you shared<br>and through the visualization of those<br>case studies and also providing the<br>we turn in now to local governments and<br>we heard professor mention the work of<br>local government to follow in terms of<br>greening the cities<br>and we're very fortunate to have with us<br>the mayor of wanganui district council<br>hamish<br>mcdougall hamish comes also as well as<br>being mayor with a law and an arts<br>background from university of otago<br>immense experience both in<br>local body politics as well as national<br>politics and overseas experience that he<br>will also bring to his role as mayor<br>we're certainly looking forward to<br>hearing about the leadership that you'll<br>be offering wanganui district council so<br>we turn now to you<br>my name is hamish mcdougall i'm the<br>mayor of wonganui and the vice president<br>of local government new zealand<br>cop 26 in glasgow seems like a big event<br>where governments and global<br>organizations meet it seems like the<br>other side of the world because it is<br>it's where you'll find joe biden and<br>billy eilish and pope francis and david<br>dave and edinburgh<br>but i argue it's vital for us in new<br>zealand to engage with it it is<br>imperative that local communities and<br>the people who govern those communities<br>listen and engage with what's happening<br>there<br>gratitude<br>has echoed millions of people stating<br>that we need action now<br>and we as the local government sector<br>are in a unique position of being able<br>to make decisions quickly and nimbly<br>whether it's to do with waste<br>minimization or public transport<br>or in particular urban planning so we<br>don't exacerbate emissions<br>councils throughout new zealand can make<br>a difference<br>the climate change commission knows this<br>the climate change commission urged<br>local government and central government<br>to work together and saw<br>councils as a key partner<br>adaptation<br>and resilience and i'll say mitigation<br>are key tenants of what we will have to<br>i want to acknowledge<br>chec the university of waikato and the<br>honourable ministers mahuta and shaw<br>have made it possible to bring cop 26 to<br>new zealand<br>what a fabulous opportunity to view<br>interact and finally implement some of<br>the knowledge and actions that will<br>emerge from this most<br>thank you also for your insight and the<br>leadership that you're showing in<br>wanganui<br>now we turn to another local government<br>representative<br>councillor jennifer nicole<br>who is part of the waikato regional<br>council where she chairs the climate<br>action committee<br>for all of local government during this<br>three years<br>she's very committed to sustainability<br>and regenerative systems and speaks<br>about the interconnectedness of us all<br>of which we have a chance of adapting to<br>climate change we turn now to you<br>my name is jennifer

from you<br>i have seen a lot of cops come and go<br>and i look forward to seeing what this<br>one brings<br>i<br>want the same i've always wanted for<br>these which is for the decision makers<br>on the ground to make some strong<br>commitments and strategies to give us<br>the best future possible<br>ultimately though i'm really excited to<br>have been part of the team that is<br>bringing you this<br>streaming event so that you can see how<br>cop 26 is relevant to us in the waikato<br>and to hear from some amazing voices of<br>local people and others who<br>know a lot about this stuff and can<br>translate it for us as to what's already<br>happening out there and what we can get<br>involved with to make this collective<br>effort to<br>work on the climate action topic<br>together<br>uh yes i'm just really grateful and i'm<br>looking forward to sitting alongside uh<br>virtually<br>everyone to see these sessions happening<br>and even getting to<br>participate in some of them<br>and yeah so<br>have a fantastic time getting to know<br>this topic further and the people on the<br>enjoy<br>the jennifer and thank you also for your<br>discussions and the work that you're<br>doing and leading the local governments<br>on this journey to help combat and<br>progress our adaptation and mitigation<br>strategies towards climate change<br>now we turn to our local and our<br>wonderful margaret evans<br>you met this morning former mayor for<br>hamilton district council and even more<br>energetic<br>citizen committed to change locally<br>politically as well as globally and you<br>know margaret i didn't know you were an<br>investigative journalist as well so<br>that's another brand of investigation<br>that that you bring so we're going to<br>thank you so much for the opportunity to<br>be with you all this morning uh i think<br>this is probably a time of a great tidal<br>wave<br>finally that is mounting that will<br>change the planet<br>hopefully i'm an optimist<br>yes um i'm margaret evans and i was for<br>nine years the mayor of hamilton<br>i've also had the privilege of being on<br>the executive local government new<br>zealand<br>perhaps over the last 20 years i've also<br>been involved with local governments for<br>sustainability<br>which is the group<br>abbreviated down to ekley international<br>council for local environmental<br>initiatives which came out of the rio<br>summit conference<br>and of course right now i'm very very<br>proud to belong to the commonwealth<br>human ecology council which is<br>partnering with the university of<br>waikato today<br>i could spend the next hour or so or<br>more going back over the last 50 years<br>talking about all of the talk that has<br>beamed all around the world<br>what i think is most important though as<br>we look backwards<br>to remember that there have been<br>thousands probably millions of people<br>all around the world who have been<br>quietly<br>beavering away making changes to their<br>practices in villages in africa and<br>villages in india throughout the pacific<br>islands and certainly here in new<br>zealand<br>because they understood that change was<br>needed<br>we're now talking about things like the<br>secular economy<br>regenerative farming<br>but we're also talking about things like<br>we don't like monocultural pines being<br>seen everywhere we would sooner see the<br>restoration of the indigenous forest<br>we don't like seeing<br>sewage pipes breaking or pouring into<br>our river<br>when there are many many other ways in<br>which we can treat our own wastes<br>we also don't like to see issues of<br>poverty in this country and we remind<br>ourselves that it wasn't for all of<br>those little ngos non-government<br>organizations or small groups of people<br>working karna hiki takanawi face-to-face<br>with people in need we would be much<br>worse off<br>so<br>what i want to see out of this next two<br>weeks not just in glasgow and cop 26 but<br>here in hamilton<br>here in new zealand<br>can we harness all our efforts can we<br>understand what's going on all over the<br>place<br>where groups of people are working and<br>now need greater support<br>i think that's the big dream<br>uh this is not just<br>public sector and private sector working<br>together<br>this is public sector private sector and<br>people everywhere p p p because we've<br>had all of the expressions such as<br>planet and<br>people<br>but perhaps the most important<br>expression of all is sustainability the<br>one thing that we all understand is that<br>we are living today<br>but we want life for tomorrow as well<br>that's the underpinning theme of cop26<br>climate change is about sustainability<br>and is about the ongoing future of this<br>planet<br>and its people kaiti akitanga says it<br>all that should be our theme so curato<br>thank you all for contributing may we<br>have a splendid two weeks<br>and become reinvigorated<br>kilda margaret and thank you too for<br>your wise guidance and those wisdoms<br>that you've shared<br>our last speaker for today is associate<br>professor tom raw many of you i'm sure<br>already know<br>about our tom raw and his reputation<br>not only has he been a tribal leader<br>ever since he was<br>well for so long<br>he's also a linguist a historian<br>committed to maori and tribal<br>development and so we're going to turn<br>to him now<br>called<br>thank you everyone for joining us<br>in this panel to the panelists to those<br>who have<br>shared their<br>thoughts<br>shared their hopes<br>shared their aspirations<br>in this local initiative<br>response<br>to<br>the global<br>with the university's ikea and other<br>capabilities<br>we aim to to write a way for people to<br>make connections locally and globally<br>with cop 26<br>and very grateful for the the support of<br>ministers mahuta and shaw<br>in particular for the commonwealth human<br>ecology council<br>and their status as an ngo at the<br>conference<br>in glasgow<br>so<br>our focus<br>in these panels<br>is<br>highlighting<br>maori indigenous<br>local voices<br>reflecting<br>their our gross grassroots support<br>of rangi and papa<br>of their children<br>of our environment<br>there's a particular urgency for<br>indigenous communities<br>as we are the most and most vulnerable<br>in the threat and the spiraling damage<br>of the effects of climate change<br>so<br>all of you<br>all of us<br>who are working<br>to affect<br>this<br>panel<br>kicks the week off<br>for us here locally<br>and i'm very grateful personally but<br>also professionally<br>to those people who have shared their<br>thoughts<br>and would welcome the thoughts of all of<br>you<br>who are tuned in<br>with the question<br>what<br>do you<br>think<br>you might want<br>we might want<br>our plan is to<br>ask you to send<br>thoughts in<br>to our university website<br>make up a little chart<br>these are the expectations these are the<br>aspirations these are the hopes<br>from cop 26.<br>initiative<br>when<br>the conference completes and finishes<br>wraps up<br>at the end of next week<br>we will have a feedback<br>and<br>let's see from that table how many ticks<br>we can put in<br>where<br>cop 26<br>actually realized something<br>from our local<br>waikato region<br>hopes<br>and aspirations<br>well that brings us to the end of this<br>afternoon's discussions we've been very<br>fortunate<br>i think to hear a range of speakers from<br>all disciplines<br>um starting with professor<br>our professor ian douglas for a<br>beautiful framing of some of the work<br>that he's done<br>as i said earlier using the visual<br>impacts of case studies that he was<br>witness to just most recently in terms<br>of his home town<br>and then starting to give us what some<br>of the figures look like but more<br>importantly also to give us some of the<br>actions<br>we thank hamish mcdowell as well for the<br>leadership that he's showing in wanganui<br>district council and as leader of the<br>local government forum of fear of mayors<br>and climate change as well<br>councillor jennifer mcnichol we know<br>doing a very very important work on the<br>ground at waikato regional council and<br>margaret for your consistent and<br>sustained efforts to keep us all honest<br>an answerable in fact to papatuanuku<br>through this concept of kaitiakitanga<br>which you continually remind us of<br>actually i was thinking you're not<br>and to you tom we know that in<br>this day and age where we've got so many<br>problems that one knowledge system<br>is no longer appropriate we need to deal<br>with<br>more than one knowledge system and in<br>that way our introductory speech by our<br>honourable honorable nanaya mahuta also<br>brought that framework into her<br>discussions which will be government-led<br>so we also thank nanaya mahuta for not<br>only as i said earlier clearly<br>articulating a plan especially in these<br>times of uncertainty but also<br>ensuring that we can see ourselves in<br>that plan so that we can all commit to<br>the actions because in the end and from<br>what i could gather from these<br>discussions it was about leadership<br>and we've heard from that leadership<br>today through government local<br>government on the ground and through<br>civil society groups<br>we've also heard about the value of<br>working together<br>mahitahi whether it be the public sector<br>as margaret said the private sector in<br>the end they all compose of people and<br>we're looking to people power to create<br>this transformative change and as people<br>power we all<br>can ensure that the government's commit<br>to action and do better than what<br>they've done in the past<br>and lastly we heard this also from our<br>honoree minister we've heard it again<br>from margaret and we've heard it from<br>tom<br>this whole concept of kaitiakitanga<br>our spiritual connections back to the<br>land<br>are intertwined are interlinked<br>as many mighty tribes have shown us in<br>their fight to be recognized within the<br>courts we are the river and the river is<br>us is one example<br>and that all is finally embedded with an<br>earth mother and sky father from whence<br>the saying comes te hei modi ora<br>kitifayao<br>kitia madama<br>the university of waikato is proud to<br>introduce the world's first bachelor of<br>climate change for the people who know<br>there is no planet b<br>gain the skills needed for the jobs of<br>tomorrow contribute to a fundamental<br>shift in the way we do business and go<br>about our lives<br>explore how matauranga maori can bring<br>perspective to the most pressing issue<br>of our time<br>apply now and carve a career where<br>so<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
