So this  <br>is going to be a couple of talks, talking all <br>around psychology and psychological behavior  <br>the psychological view on behavior how humans <br>behave and how we can understand that better.  <br>And this is brought to you by people who actually <br>have studied that intensively and who want to  <br>share their knowledge with you and give you the <br>opportunity to discuss it also so we'll have  <br>some part of talk in the at the beginning <br>and then you can ask questions later on so  <br>feel free to pop in questions throughout into <br>the Q and A box or in the chat preferably  <br>in the Q and A box and we'll come to that <br>towards the end and our discussion section so  <br>now I'm very pleased to introduce our first <br>speaker of the series Professor Marc Wilson to you  <br>who's been at Te Herenga Waka for a <br>very very long time he's basically  <br>inherent like a basic keystone in the department <br>of psychology and also in the university  <br>he has always had apparently a key interest <br>in human behavior so and the social way the  <br>people interact and also the way that that <br>this interactions impact on the future and  <br>on attitudes and anything that has to do with <br>human well-being youth well-being as well to  <br>why do people eat meat or don't eat meat also <br>social dominance so how is it that groups  <br>behave in a certain way and he is today sharing <br>with us some of his experience and knowledge  <br>about conspiracy theories so I'm very pleased to <br>introduce Marc to you and handing over to Marc to  <br>share what he wants to talk about <br>conspiracy theories kia ora tātou,  <br>thank you so much for that introduction <br>Hedwig whoever that person was he sounded  <br>very interesting I look forward to meeting him at <br>some point so hopefully you can see my screen now  <br>I'm going to take the absence of commentary <br>to suggest that you can so as Hedwig indicated  <br>I've been at Te Herenga Waka for a long time I <br>came here as a small child after completing my  <br>undergraduate study here at Victoria University <br>completed a PhD and then did a bunch of unpleasant  <br>jobs that no one else wanted to do until I got <br>a job and that job was teaching research methods  <br>advanced research methods in 2003 and one of <br>the things I rapidly learned in the process of  <br>developing that course was that not everyone <br>studies psychology to learn about research methods  <br>in fact most people are here because they're <br>interested in psychology and I'm just going to  <br>get rid of the floating meeting controls <br>and so I had to find a vehicle to teach  <br>research methods and statistics and I learned <br>very early on that there are many things in  <br>everyday life that are highly motivating people <br>to study paranormal beliefs and more recently  <br>conspiracy beliefs so I used those as a vehicle <br>to teach people how to do psychological research  <br>and along the way I also conducted a fair amount <br>of research on these topics myself so I'm going to  <br>give you a bit of a wander through those through <br>those studies that I conducted as well as linking  <br>into international research and some things that <br>some of my colleagues have done I promise you that  <br>I'm going to talk a little bit about COVID but I'm <br>going to start off by giving you an introduction  <br>to conspiracy theories and the psychology <br>of conspiracy theories to start off with<br>so a couple of caveats it is not my intention to <br>make fun of people who believe in conspiracies  <br>there are a number of very good reasons for this <br>that I will get to shortly one of which is that  <br>there is evidence that conspiracy theories have <br>and do happen secondly we live at the moment in  <br>a world in which we have a global pandemic and the <br>big discussion in Aotearoa New Zealand right now  <br>is whether or not to get vaccinated the majority <br>of New Zealanders have done so already more than  <br>85 percent of those eligible have had at least <br>one vaccination I'm double vaccinated myself and  <br>I have the advantage of working at an <br>institution that has a world-class library  <br>and work alongside people who work in vaccine <br>development as a result I am fairly convinced  <br>that this is the right thing to do and that <br>it's safe but I understand that people who  <br>may not have access in the privileged way that <br>I do that information may have concerns so take  <br>it from me as an expert it's a good thing to <br>get done and if you don't believe me believe  <br>the people around you when you walk down the <br>street today statistically eight or nine of the  <br>people you walk past will have been vaccinated <br>and they have been vaccinated entirely safely  <br>so quick primer on conspiracy theories if we <br>look through the history of conspiracy theories  <br>and conspiracy theory research psychology has <br>come fairly late to the party in fact it wasn't  <br>until the mid-1980s with the publication of a <br>book called changing conceptions of conspiracy  <br>that psychological researchers became interested <br>in this topic but it wasn't for another 15 or 20  <br>years until people like myself became interested <br>that we started to see a burgeoning of research  <br>on this area at the same time there is a long <br>history of conspiracies and conspiracy theorising  <br>that we can draw upon let's take as an example <br>the American one dollar note minted in 1935.  <br>There's lots of things going on in this particular <br>piece of currency I'm only going to focus on the  <br>great seal to the left of the note specifically <br>conspiracy theorists have suggested that if you  <br>use the all-seeing eye supposedly representative <br>of an omnipresent omnipotent all-seeing god  <br>and we create two opposing triangles we can see <br>the letters spelling out mason so the a of annuit  <br>the s of coeptis the n of novus the o of ordo and <br>the m of seclorum spelling out the word mason in  <br>fact novus ordo seclorum means new world order and <br>this is a term that people who have spent a little  <br>bit of time in conspiracy theory circles would be <br>intimately familiar with some conspiracy theorists  <br>argue the traditional symbol represents that of <br>freemasonry if we take the calipers and set square  <br>and place them in the way that they're routinely <br>presented it looks a lot like this six-pointed  <br>circle this in turn points to a demonic Jewish <br>conspiracy to topple Christianity in fact we find  <br>the all-seeing eye in a variety of other symbology <br>for example the logos of media empire CBS and Time  <br>Warner and even that of MI5 for those of you <br>don't know MI5 is that branch of the British  <br>Secret Service that's responsible for making sure <br>that people within the United Kingdom are safe  <br>not at all suspicious going back to currency <br>if you take an American 10 dollar note minted  <br>between 1998 and 2003 and you fold it just so you <br>end up with an image that looks an awful lot like  <br>the Twin Towers after being struck by the two <br>planes that were flown into them by terrorists  <br>on September 11 2001. Again this <br>adds fuel to the idea that the masons  <br>who based on that one dollar note <br>we know already all the world  <br>are responsible for the events of 9/11 <br>and indeed of course this is particularly  <br>concerning because this 10 note was minted <br>three years before the events of 9/11.<br>at the same time 9/11 plays an important <br>role in the popularization of both conspiracy  <br>theories and the development of research on <br>conspiracy theories themselves this is a gif  <br>of static images taken from a parking camera <br>outside the Pentagon as the plane unsuccessfully  <br>intended to destroy it crashed into it on on 9 11 <br>2001. In fact if you go online you'll find very  <br>various examples of this image which have been <br>doctored to suggest that it was in fact a missile  <br>but I show you this because there has been an <br>increase in interest in conspiracy theories since  <br>the events of 9/11 and this coincides with the <br>development of the internet the reality is that up  <br>until 9/11 the number of people who are who were <br>naturally interested in conspiracy theories were  <br>sufficiently small that they could walk down the <br>street without meeting anyone who believed the  <br>same things as them the internet has provided <br>a forum in which people who believe in things  <br>that may not be mainstream to come together <br>and to talk about the things that they believe  <br>and potentially depending on your point your <br>viewpoint it provides an echo chamber in which  <br>people can have their beliefs about <br>things like conspiracies reinforced  <br>but conspiracies have been with us for a long <br>time prior to 9/11. Perhaps one of the oldest  <br>that we are aware of and gets talked about in the <br>literature is the idea of blood libel popularized  <br>in the book and movie The Da Vinci Code blood <br>libel is the idea that the Jewish people for  <br>hundreds of years if not millennia have <br>been kidnapping and murdering gentile people  <br>to mix their blood into the bread that they <br>use as part of their Passover celebration  <br>so here on the slide I have an image <br>of a woodcut which was made in the  <br>1500s this has been around for an awful long <br>time and it's easy for us to sit here in our  <br>privileged vantage point and think but who <br>would be silly enough to believe that now  <br>but if we fast forward to 2002 approximately 20 <br>years ago this is an example of a scan of a poster  <br>which was put up around San Francisco University <br>as part of a global campaign criticizing  <br>the actions of the Israeli state in Palestine <br>that draws off this idea of blood libel  <br>Palestinian children meet slaughtered according <br>to Jewish rights under American license the  <br>point that I'm trying to make here is that it's <br>very easy to characterize things like conspiracy  <br>theories is a bit of a laugh but they actually <br>do have implications for our everyday lives<br>And probably the poster child for <br>the most important example of this  <br>is the Tuskegee syphilis experiments between 1932 <br>and 1972 African-American men and their families  <br>who had been diagnosed with syphilis were invited <br>to get free medical treatment for their condition  <br>they would rock up to these things that looks <br>like a Winnebago but it's not that far away  <br>from something like our vaccination buses that <br>are traveling around the country at the moment  <br>to receive their free treatment they would meet <br>they would they would complete a survey talking  <br>about their symptoms and they would walk away with <br>a bottle of pills to help them now the sad tragedy  <br>of this was the pills they were given were not <br>in fact an active treatment they were sugar pills  <br>and the intention of this whole study was not to <br>cure syphilis but to study how syphilis develops  <br>and the consequences of it if left untreated so <br>part of the tragedy here is that it went on for  <br>40 years in fact by the time that a whistleblower <br>drew attention to this this atrocity many of the  <br>people who had first designed it had already died <br>as had many of the participants in the Tuskegee  <br>syphilis study there was a big Congressional <br>investigation there was reparations made  <br>the people who had been affected received the <br>princely sum of a thousand dollars assuming  <br>that they had died if they themselves had died <br>it was passed on to their family but of course  <br>syphilis is an STI that means that you pass it <br>on to your nearest and dearest which meant that  <br>many of their wives had died in fact STIs like <br>syphilis can be transmitted to babies as they're  <br>born so many of their offspring died as well it is <br>no surprise therefore that among African Americans  <br>the uptake and adherence to drugs like HIV AIDS <br>treatments for example are much lower than they  <br>are amongst other racial groups in part because <br>African Americans have been shown to believe a  <br>third of them have been shown to believe that <br>the American government is experimenting upon  <br>them a third are not sure and a third believe <br>that actually it's completely coincidental if  <br>you believe that the medical authorities who are <br>telling you to take drugs are the same ones who've  <br>experimented on you I don't think it's a surprise <br>that you don't pay attention to what they say  <br>in fact very recent research in the context <br>of COVID-19 shows that African Americans  <br>amongst the most vaccine hesitant approximately <br>a third of African Americans say that they feel  <br>very uncomfortable with the idea of taking the <br>vaccine close behind them are Republicans at about  <br>29 percent I'm going to talk briefly about both of <br>these groups as we move through this presentation  <br>in fact New Zealand has its own conspiracy <br>magazine Uncensored first published in the  <br>mid-2000s in a slightly odd collaboration between <br>international conspiracy theorist Jonathan Eisen  <br>and one of perhaps New Zealand's most <br>prolific pornographers Steve Crowe  <br>and in fact continues to this date I've <br>noted the importance of the internet for the  <br>dissemination of conspiracy theories and the <br>opportunity for people who believe in conspiracy  <br>theories to come together and it continues online <br>as well as in print and it has a significant  <br>section devoted to COVID conspiracies <br>so for example Joe Biden ignores DC  <br>mask mandate in latest round of COVID <br>hypocrisy and very recently from Aotearoa  <br>New Zealand Jacinda Ardern says that everyday <br>activities won't be available to be unvaccinated<br>so how common are conspiracy beliefs it's very <br>easy to characterize these as the preserve of  <br>a very small and slightly wacky group of the <br>population so I'm going to present some data  <br>from a study that I conducted a number of years <br>ago now I disseminated it through popular media  <br>through the Sunday Star Times newspaper <br>more than 6000 New Zealanders completed it,  <br>it involved a survey of a whole bunch of different <br>things about New Zealanders spiritual lives and  <br>asked about religion their paranormal beliefs but <br>it also asked about conspiracies and urban myths  <br>and these are the broad results there are several <br>take-home messages from this the first is that  <br>depending on what you think of as a conspiracy <br>theory there is quite a lot of diversity in the  <br>extent to which people believe or are uncertain or <br>don't believe in a particular idea so for example  <br>something like 80 percent of New Zealanders say <br>that the Iraq war was not about oil was not about  <br>democracy but it was about oil something like <br>40 percent of New Zealanders believe that New  <br>Zealand is manipulated by big business in fact <br>35 percent of New Zealanders argue that the All  <br>Blacks were poisoned before the 1995 World Cup <br>to make it easier for the Springboks to win that  <br>rugby championship those are really reasonably <br>large numbers but if we move down towards the  <br>opposite end we find that something like eight <br>percent of New Zealanders say in fact fewer than  <br>8 percent of New Zealanders say that Elvis faked <br>his own death that there is a conspiracy against  <br>Māori that Dana was assassinated rather than <br>dying in a tragic car accident and something  <br>like 20 percent of New Zealanders say that <br>the NASA moon landings were faked importantly  <br>I think it's safe to say that the majority of New <br>Zealanders will believe in at least one conspiracy  <br>but something like five percent or less will <br>believe in enough conspiracy theories to be  <br>considered a conspiracy theorist we're talking <br>about a relatively small group of the population  <br>but many of us believe in at least one thing that <br>might be characterized as a conspiracy theory<br>so why do people endorse conspiracy theories <br>why do people believe these things up until  <br>the early 2000s we didn't have very much research <br>upon which to answer these kinds of questions but  <br>there was a reasonable amount of theory probably <br>one of the most common theoretical explanations  <br>for this is something that has been called the <br>social marginality or deprivation hypothesis  <br>this is the idea that people who occupy <br>marginalized positions in society low status  <br>positions in society economically disadvantaged <br>positions in society are more likely to endorse  <br>deviant beliefs like paranormal phenomena <br>religious phenomena or conspiratorial phenomena  <br>in part because it helps to gain an explanation as <br>to why people sit in the positions that they do in  <br>our society more recently eminent psychologists <br>like Serge Moscavici and Aaron Kruglinski have  <br>argued that conspiratorial thinking is the <br>province of the disenfranchised in part it  <br>serves the function of helping us reconcile our <br>frustrated aspirations but what does the data say<br>here's my first example of research conducted in <br>Aotearoa New Zealand here we have Ana Stojanov  <br>and her PhD supervisor Jamin Halberstadt what anna <br>did in her PhD was to try and test systematically  <br>this idea that lacking control or lacking <br>power was associated with conspiracy beliefs  <br>in one of the studies in her PhD <br>subsequently published in 2020  <br>she took advantage of a statistical technique <br>called meta-analysis now in many experimental  <br>studies we have relatively few participants <br>experiments are hard they take a lot of work and  <br>as a result we often don't have very many people <br>that we're able to recruit to participate in them  <br>this creates the problem that sometimes we might <br>find support for our hypothesis not because that  <br>hypothesis is not worth supporting but perhaps <br>because we didn't have enough people to test it  <br>meta-analysis is a technique that takes advantage <br>of smooshing all of those studies together  <br>and taking advantage of their combined <br>statistical power but as we can see in  <br>the triangle the square in the circle here when <br>you take all of these things and smoosh them  <br>together the relationship between lack of control <br>or having control and conspiracy endorsement  <br>is about zero there is limited evidence <br>based on the international literature  <br>suggests that this is actually a worthwhile <br>hypothesis but maybe it's not that simple  <br>one of the studies which Stojanov and Halberstadt <br>looked at in their meta-analysis was conducted by  <br>Whitson and Galinsky and published in 2008 in <br>a very eminent publication science Whitson and  <br>Galinski showed their participants a series of <br>what they call snowy pictures half of these snowy  <br>pictures are just degraded pictures of nothing <br>so for example our second panel here at the same  <br>time some of the pictures are degraded pictures of <br>something real when I look at this the second line  <br>the first on the left for example I see something <br>that looks to me a little bit like a tent  <br>not everyone will necessarily see that and that's <br>what they take advantage of the participants  <br>before being shown these pictures are put into <br>one of two conditions they're asked to either  <br>solve mathematical problems that they can solve <br>they're very simple or they're given mathematical  <br>problems that cannot be solved this is the <br>low power condition they argue that perhaps  <br>if control is associated with conspiracy theories <br>then what we should see is that people will see  <br>things in pictures when there aren't something <br>when they are in a position of low control  <br>and in fact according to Ana Stojanov and <br>Jamin Halberstadt this study shows limited  <br>evidence for this hypothesis that control or a <br>lack of control leads to conspiracy theorizing<br>but maybe it's not that simple maybe some people <br>are more likely to see conspiracies than others  <br>in the 1950s a term apophenia was <br>coined to describe the idea that  <br>sometimes some people make connections <br>between things that other people wouldn't make  <br>they might see things that other people don't <br>see so for example we have an ultrasound here  <br>that some people might see as an image of Jesus <br>but not all of us would see that the idea of  <br>apophenia is that some of us are more likely to <br>make these connections than others this is an idea  <br>that a student of mine and John McDowell at Te <br>Herenga Waka tested a number of years ago Darshani  <br>Kumareswaran took this basic paradigm what Whitson <br>and Galinsky did you give people mathematical  <br>problems that they either can or can't solve you <br>then show them these snowy images some of which  <br>are based on something real and some of them which <br>aren't and we look to see whether or not people  <br>saw things in these images depending on whether <br>they were in a situation of low or high control  <br>now what the statistics here are supposed to show <br>you is that actually regardless of whether people  <br>were given a task they could complete there was <br>no difference in people's ability to correctly  <br>identify that there were or were not meaningful <br>images in those stimuli but what we also did was  <br>to administer a measure that was designed <br>to assess the extent to which people make  <br>these connections between things their tendency <br>to see things that other people might not see  <br>in fact when a person is given tasks they <br>cannot complete and they score high on this  <br>thing called magical thinking this making <br>of connections between things they were  <br>much more likely to see things in those <br>snowy images where there wasn't anything  <br>than see things that weren't present when people <br>don't feel control and they exhibit this trait  <br>of magical thinking they're more likely to <br>see things when there aren't things there  <br>I think that this makes kind of sense right if <br>you're the kind of person who draws these kind of  <br>connections and maybe you have a reason to look <br>for connections to be drawn you're the sort of  <br>person who looks out your window and you see the <br>the black van sitting out on the street and you  <br>think to yourself that's interesting I'm pretty <br>sure I saw that a week ago maybe it's someone  <br>surveilling the neighborhood maybe <br>it's someone who's checking up on me<br>a second theoretical position on deviant beliefs <br>including conspiracy theories is the idea of  <br>something called the cognitive correlates or <br>deficits hypothesis this is perhaps characterized  <br>most strongly by Otis and Alcock and Alcock in <br>1981 they argue that the reason why people believe  <br>weird things is because they're weird there's <br>something wrong with them that they are in some  <br>way mentally deficient in fact there is a fairly <br>widespread stereotype of the conspiracy theorist  <br>as someone who wears a tin foil hat who believes <br>really really crazy things that no one would  <br>possibly believe in part because there's something <br>wrong with them they're psychologically disordered  <br>surprisingly few people have looked at whether <br>or not this might in fact be the case so here's  <br>an example of one simple study it involves <br>first-year psychology students something like 90  <br>it's probably exaggeration at least 75 of all <br>published psychology up until the 2000s was based  <br>on first-year psychology students psychology is in <br>fact the study of psychology students and in this  <br>survey what I did was to administer a measure <br>of conspiracy belief but also several measures  <br>of paranoia and psychopathology psychological <br>distress paranoia is a really interesting thing  <br>to study people who study paranoia experimentally <br>and in research don't just ask people are  <br>you paranoid instead what they do is they ask <br>people have you ever had the following belief  <br>that you're being followed how frequently have <br>you had that do you believe that it's the case  <br>that you're being followed and how distressing is <br>it that you believe this because it's possible for  <br>people to think yeah occasionally I think that <br>I'm being followed but I don't worry about it I  <br>don't have it very often and actually to be <br>quite honest I don't believe that it's true  <br>you're paranoid if you have that belief you <br>have it frequently you believe that it's true  <br>and it causes you distress in this survey <br>I also ask people to complete a measure  <br>called the British Inventory of Mental Pathology <br>which assesses a variety of different symptoms  <br>associated with psychological distress and here <br>are the results these are correlations those  <br>of you who studied psychology or statistics will <br>know that correlations vary between 1 and minus 1  <br>a score closer to 1or minus 1 means that there's <br>a closer relationship and basically what I find is  <br>very weak evidence that people who are paranoid <br>are more likely to endorse conspiracy theories  <br>that people who show evidence of psychological <br>distress grandiose beliefs paranoid beliefs  <br>intrusive thoughts somatic distress that's where <br>you manifest your psychological distress through  <br>your body and bodily symptoms but these are really <br>weak they are nowhere near the smoking gun the  <br>silver bullet or the defining characteristic of <br>conspiracy theories my take home messages is there  <br>is a statistically significant but really very <br>weak relationship between belief in conspiracies  <br>and measures of mental distress and paranoia the <br>stereotype says that people believe these things  <br>because they're paranoid the research suggests <br>that perhaps it's not as clear-cut as that  <br>I think part of the answer to what is driving this <br>is that idea of magical thinking that I've already  <br>talked about this ability make connections between <br>things that other people might otherwise see<br>a third and fourth variation of these theoretical <br>positions on deviant beliefs are what's called the  <br>attitudinal worldview hypothesis the idea that <br>some people have a subjective or emotionally  <br>driven view of the world that leads them to <br>believe in slightly odd things while some people  <br>have a rational intellectual or evidence-based <br>view of the world that leads them to reject  <br>these kinds of dodgy ideas or my favorite version <br>of all of these theoretical positions which is  <br>a personality correlates or psychodynamic <br>hypothesis this is basically the idea that  <br>psychologically we do and believe the things <br>that we do because they serve a function and  <br>actually I don't think it's too far away from this <br>social marginality hypothesis right the idea that  <br>if you're part of a socially marginalized group <br>it helps to explain why you're a member of that  <br>group why you're not at the top of the pile by <br>believing in these sorts of things so this kind of  <br>functional hypothesis said says that sometimes we <br>might believe in conspiracies because it is more  <br>psychologically comfortable to do so than believe <br>that the bad stuff that happens in the world  <br>happens randomly it helps give order to the <br>things that we see so what's the evidence for this<br>Ronald Inglehart very famous political scientist <br>has argued amongst other things that social  <br>extremity sets the context for conspiracy beliefs <br>those with political views to the extreme left  <br>or right the extreme liberal or conservative <br>are going to be the people who are most likely  <br>to exhibit conspiratorial thinking so in this <br>particular figure that I show you here he has  <br>levels of distrust at on the y-axis and he <br>has people positioned from political left  <br>to political right and what this figure shows <br>is that the people who are most extreme right  <br>or most extreme left have in common the fact that <br>they are least trusting of the authorities around  <br>them it doesn't matter whether you are an extreme <br>Greens supporter or an extreme ACT supporter the  <br>odds are that you're part of a minority fewer <br>people vote for your political party than vote  <br>for the mainstream parties and as a result we have <br>to deal with say why why is it that more people  <br>don't believe the things that we do or maybe <br>it's because there's a conspiracy that's going on<br>another one of my favorite studies in 2013 <br>Stephan Lewandowsky and his colleagues published  <br>a paper in which they looked at the relationship <br>between conspiracy theories political beliefs  <br>and attitudes towards climate change this was a <br>highly contentious paper at the time that it was  <br>published so let me run you through this this is <br>a structural equation model you can kind of think  <br>of it like a printed circuit board if there's an <br>arrow from one thing to another then you can think  <br>of that like electricity flowing from in this <br>case conspiracists ideation to climate scientists  <br>science beliefs or from conspiracist beliefs <br>through to belief cynicism about other sciences  <br>and what this shows is that the more people <br>feel supportive of free market economics  <br>the more likely they are to disagree with <br>anthropogenic climate change the idea that  <br>the climate is changing and human beings have <br>something to do with it it's also the case that  <br>the more you believe in free market economics the <br>more skeptical of other sciences you are the more  <br>you believe in conspiracies the more skeptical of <br>other sciences you are this paper was primarily  <br>focused on the idea that the more you believe in <br>conspiracies the less supportive of anthropogenic  <br>climate change you are again this is kind of like <br>a correlation what it shows is that there's a  <br>statistically significant but weak relationship <br>between conspiracy beliefs and climate science  <br>beliefs it's much less strong than the <br>relationship between your political  <br>economic beliefs that the free market is the right <br>way for things to go and climate science however<br>in a follow-up paper Lewandowsky and colleagues <br>extended this idea to look not just at climate  <br>science but several scientific issues so for <br>example are genetically modified foods safe  <br>are vaccinations safe is anthropogenic <br>climate change really happening  <br>and one of the consistent elements that <br>they report is that the more people endorse  <br>conspiracy theories the less positive they <br>are the less likely they are to believe  <br>that GM foods are safe that vaccinations are <br>safe and that climate change is happening  <br>again conservatism political conservatism and <br>endorsement of free market economics were also  <br>strongly predictive of several of these <br>things vaccinations and climate change  <br>but not genetically modified food safety so what <br>we have here is evidence for two things firstly  <br>the extent to which you endorse conspiracies <br>is associated with your belief in contemporary  <br>scientific issues like GM foods vaccination <br>safety and climate change but also that your  <br>political beliefs are quite important in this <br>context as well remember that I've already shown  <br>you a study from the United States that shows <br>that African Americans who are actually usually  <br>politically liberal but also Republicans are more <br>likely to be vaccine hesitant in the United States<br>so let me introduce you one of my <br>intellectual heroes in psychology this  <br>is Professor John Duckitt he's an Emeritus <br>Professor at the University of Auckland  <br>and he is important for proposing what I think <br>is as close to a grand theory of everything  <br>for social scientists like myself it's called the <br>dual process model of intergroup attitudes and  <br>it's not to do with how people think about <br>science or covert or conspiracy theories  <br>it's a model of how people think about different <br>groups I'll run you through this according to John  <br>Duckitt there are one two or a combination <br>of those two ways that people come to feel  <br>negative towards people who don't look like them <br>to show out group prejudice in the first part  <br>it originates in our childhood experience if <br>you experience a childhood where you're heavily  <br>punished for misbehavior then you develop a <br>personality that is very socially conforming  <br>you don't like stepping outside the lines as a <br>result you see the world as a dangerous place  <br>you're very sensitive to threats or things <br>that make it appear more dangerous and that  <br>means that you are predisposed to believe that <br>the authorities the legitimate authorities are  <br>the people who can look after you and keep <br>you safe from the dangers in your world  <br>as a result you're more likely to like people who <br>look like you because they're safe and you're more  <br>likely to feel negative about people who don't <br>look or don't believe the same things as you  <br>because they are threats to your view of the <br>world on the other hand you may experience  <br>an unaffectionate socialisation not enough hugs <br>in this case imagine growing up without parents  <br>who show you any affection you probably develop a <br>fairly ruthless tough-minded kind of personality  <br>that sees the world as a competitive jungle <br>a place in which if you don't do the biting  <br>you're going to get bit that there are bad <br>people out to get you and if you don't get  <br>them first they're going to take your stuff as <br>a result you see the world as a hierarchy with  <br>important people and things at the top preferably <br>where you're going to be and less important people  <br>and things down the bottom these are the things <br>that need to be kept in their place as a result  <br>you like people who look like you because they're <br>going to help reinforce your position in the world  <br>and you dislike people who don't look or think <br>like you because they are threats to your social  <br>position this theory is tremendously powerful <br>explaining out group attitudes beliefs about  <br>people who are different to you in fact in <br>statistical terms it explains about half of  <br>the variation how people feel about those <br>groups but it also applies to other things<br>this is John Kerr a PhD student of mine <br>he now lives in the UK and he works at the  <br>University of Cambridge and as part of his PhD we <br>collected data from more than 9000 New Zealanders  <br>asking them about their beliefs about science <br>as well as these views of whether or not we  <br>should listen to authorities and whether or not <br>we think the world should be a hierarchical place  <br>what his research showed <br>was that the older you are  <br>generally speaking the less likely you are to <br>believe the contemporary scientific position  <br>if you are a woman you're also more likely to be <br>sensitive to concerns about contemporary science  <br>at the moment in the context of COVID we know that <br>women with children are more likely to be vaccine  <br>hesitant for example than men who don't have any <br>children we also know according to John's research  <br>that people who think that the authorities are <br>there to protect us are less likely to believe in  <br>climate change they're less likely to think that <br>GM foods are safe they're less likely to think the  <br>vaccinations are safe they're less likely to think <br>that fluoridation in our water to keep our teeth  <br>sound is safe and they're less likely to believe <br>in evolution and the more we believe that the  <br>world is structured hierarchically or should be <br>structured hierarchically with important people at  <br>the top and less important people at the bottom <br>the less likely we are to believe in climate  <br>change and the safety of vaccines and fluoride <br>so let me put this all together in a second<br>we can take advantage of the structural equation <br>modeling that I've mentioned earlier on remember  <br>this is like that circuit board where we <br>see some things providing power to others  <br>so on the far left of the circuit board we have <br>authoritarianism RWA the extent to which people  <br>endorse authorities as being important people <br>should pay attention to and who will look after us  <br>and hierarchy the extent to which we believe the <br>world should be structured in such a way that  <br>some people are at the top and some people at <br>the bottom and that's the way that it should be  <br>these in turn provide power to a variety <br>of other things political conservatism free  <br>market attitudes whether or not we're religious <br>the extent to which we know a lot about science  <br>the extent to which we trust scientists and also <br>the extent to which we believe in conspiracies  <br>and that the outcome the output <br>of this printed circuit board  <br>is power to our beliefs about climate change <br>evolution GM foods vaccines or fluoridation safety<br>firstly beliefs about authorities and <br>hierarchies tend to predict most of  <br>these things sitting in the middle our beliefs <br>about authority predict all of them so the more  <br>we believe that authorities are important <br>the more politically conservative the more  <br>free market supportive we are the more religious <br>we are the more we believe in conspiracies the  <br>less literate we are about scientists science and <br>the less trusting we are of scientists the more  <br>we believe about the belief that hierarchies are <br>the way that things should go the more politically  <br>conservative we are the more we believe in <br>free market economics the less religious  <br>we are this is one of the interesting things in <br>this model and also the less we trust scientists<br>however the extent to which we trust scientists <br>is the only thing of these things that sit in  <br>the middle of this figure that predict our <br>attitudes to all of these scientific issues  <br>so the less we try scientists the less we <br>believe in climate change the less we think that  <br>GM foods and vaccines and fluoride safe <br>the less likely we are to believe that  <br>evolution is the way that human beings <br>came to be the way that we currently are  <br>importantly conspiracy beliefs predict <br>how we feel about GM foods about vaccines  <br>and about fluoridation of our water I think this <br>is probably one of the reasons why we see what's  <br>happening in the world around us at the moment <br>when it comes to COVID vaccination for example  <br>there are so many examples of medical conspiracies <br>that perhaps it's not unreasonable to worry  <br>that the vaccinations that we're being told <br>to take are in fact perhaps not good for us  <br>the more distrusting we are of the message that <br>perhaps covet is not as dangerous as it appears<br>I'll let you watch the animation because <br>I'm very proud of us today just to do<br>we also replicated this in American sample <br>as well so it's not just Aotearoa New Zealand  <br>where we find this thing in America we find that <br>conspiracy beliefs also predict decreased belief  <br>that GM foods are safe vaccines are safe and that <br>fluoridation is safe and again importantly the  <br>extent to which we trust scientists is importantly <br>predictive of all of these things think at the  <br>moment when you turn on that one o'clock news <br>bulletin for example how frequently have you  <br>seen Baker how many how many times have you seen <br>Jackson these scientists epidemiologists who work  <br>in this area coming out and pummeling through <br>this message about the importance of vaccinations  <br>this I think is a really really good thing and I'm <br>thrilled that they're out there but if you don't  <br>trust scientists then are you going to trust those <br>people to tell you what's in your best interest<br>let's have a look at this model in the context <br>of skepticism about COVID this is based on some  <br>PSYC122 student data so about 800 students in <br>one of our first year psychology courses who  <br>completed measures of right-wing authoritarianism <br>the extent to which you think the authorities are  <br>there to protect you social dominance orientation <br>the extent to which you think the hierarchy is  <br>the way that the world should be organized but <br>also the extent to which you trust science and  <br>we're using these to predict the extent to which <br>people endorse the existence of COVID as a serious  <br>disease and the importance of vaccinations and <br>again it pretty much works that is to say that  <br>trust in science is consistently associated with <br>all of these things the more authoritarian you are  <br>the less likely you are to trust science the more <br>social dominant or endorsing of hierarchy you are  <br>the less likely you are to trust science but the <br>more you trust science the less skeptical you are  <br>about COVID the more authoritarian the more <br>social dominant you are the more skeptical  <br>you are and these things work through trust <br>and science if you're authoritarian or you  <br>believe the hierarchy is the way that the world <br>should be structured you'd see that you're less  <br>trusting of scientists and that in turn means that <br>you're less likely to in to believe that COVID  <br>is dangerous that it's real and that you <br>should go out and get a vaccination for it<br>so far I've talked about international research <br>or research that I've conducted and I'm going to  <br>finish by showing you some research conducted <br>also in Aotearoa but by people who aren't me  <br>so in a recent study which was conducted by Taylor <br>Winter a PhD student here at Te Herenga Waka  <br>Taylor's supervisor Paul Jose and a couple of <br>other colleagues originally from University  <br>of Otago Damien Scarf and Ben Riordan they <br>conducted a fairly large-scale survey in which  <br>they asked New Zealanders about several things <br>to what extent did they believe in conspiracies  <br>did they see themselves on a scale from one <br>to seven would they characterize themselves as  <br>politically conservative or politically liberal <br>and how much did they trust science and the  <br>important take home here is illustrated in the <br>figure here trust in science is associated with  <br>conspiracy beliefs about COVID so if you don't <br>trust scientists you're more likely to believe  <br>that COVID is a hoax and that vaccination is <br>bad for you the more politically right way or  <br>conservative you are in Aoteraoa New Zealand the <br>more skeptical you are about COVID but also the  <br>more you tend to be skeptical about science but <br>these things interact and that's why these lines  <br>are not parallel if we take the green line at <br>the top this is the line that represents those  <br>people who are most distrusting of science if you <br>are politically liberal and you're distrusting of  <br>science then you sit somewhere around about your <br>ambivalent about COVID conspiracies you're on the  <br>fence but if you are politically conservative <br>you strongly believe that COVID is a hoax the  <br>red line in the middle is those people who are <br>sort of moderate in terms of their trust of  <br>science and they're kind of a middle ground but <br>if we look at our low distrust of science group  <br>the people who are represented by the blue <br>line you can see that if you trust science  <br>it doesn't matter whether you're politically <br>or liberal but you're politically conservative  <br>or politically liberal in Aotearoa the reality <br>is that you feel pretty much the same about COVID  <br>and that's generally that it's dangerous it's <br>a problem and that we ought to get vaccinated  <br>in combination then I think the <br>point that I'd like to make is that  <br>conspiracy theories are not just the <br>province of tin foil hat wearing people  <br>who have something wrong with them <br>the research does not support that<br>there's international evidence that suggests that <br>how comfortable you feel in your control of the  <br>world around you is unrelated your conspiracy <br>beliefs and I go along with that accepting that  <br>some people maybe these people who have a greater <br>tendency to go looking for connections between  <br>things are more likely when they feel a lack of <br>control of their the world around them to believe  <br>in conspiracies and finally these things have real <br>world implications conspiracy belief is associated  <br>with distrust it's one of the most consistent <br>relationships that we find in the world that we  <br>currently live in with a global pandemic in which <br>hundreds of thousands millions of people have died  <br>it is the case that those people who are least <br>likely to believe firstly the popular press that  <br>COVID is a bad thing and that people have died but <br>also that vaccination is the right thing to do are  <br>more likely to believe in conspiracies so thank <br>you very much for your attention I look forward  <br>to having an opportunity to chat with you about <br>what I talked about and to answer your questions  <br>and I really wish that we would have been <br>able to do this in person thank you very much<br>Ngā mihi nui Marc the applause <br>is quiet but very heartfelt  <br>but I don't know if I should trust you of <br>course not because I'm a scientist yeah I'm  <br>really doubtful so this puts a lot of pressure on <br>scientists doesn't it I mean I'm pretty impressed  <br>by that so we have a couple of questions that I <br>would like to read out to you also if people want  <br>to rather speak up and please raise your hand <br>then I can allow you questions also by a voice  <br>so one of the questions was related to the <br>relationship so you mentioned some aspects related  <br>relationship to well psychological phenomena like <br>or personality traits or these kind of things  <br>but one question was if it was also related <br>to creativity do you think that conspiracy  <br>theorists are just really creative so I think that <br>there is a connection between these two things  <br>creativity and conspiracy belief that might be <br>mediated by one of the five pillars of personality  <br>so we know from tens of thousands of studies now <br>that everybody's personality is based on maybe  <br>five different components traits extroversion <br>agreeableness neuroticism but importantly one  <br>is called openness to experience and what we <br>find is that people who are open to experiences  <br>are more likely to both be creative but they're <br>also more likely to go well hey you know what  <br>that conspiracy theory could be the way the thing <br>goes things are go so maybe there is there is a  <br>component to that okay great thank you there's <br>another question thanks for the interesting talk  <br>you mentioned that many people hold one or <br>two conspiracy beliefs while others hold  <br>multiple beliefs are there clusters in the <br>types of beliefs that tend to go together  <br>great question it's almost as if I planted it <br>so when we so one of the things that I have done  <br>is so I've asked people about their conspiracy <br>beliefs in a variety of different ways and there  <br>are two broad ways that we do this in the first <br>way what people do is to ask do you believe that  <br>well I showed examples of this do you believe that <br>NASA faked the moon landings do you believe that  <br>the events of 9/11 were a false flag operation <br>by the American government but in the other way  <br>of measuring it we ask people about their tendency <br>to believe the world is run by conspiracies do you  <br>believe that there are conspiracies happening <br>in the background that nobody has evidence of  <br>when we look at the specific conspiracies and <br>we conduct a statistical technique called factor  <br>analysis which looks for clusters of things <br>which go together there do seem to be families  <br>of conspiracy theories so for example there are <br>there's a family of conspiracy theories that  <br>seem to locate around our beliefs about <br>whether or not aliens have visited the world  <br>our earth and have been covered up by world <br>governments so do you believe that Area 51  <br>houses evidence of alien visits do you believe <br>that thousands of people are kidnapped each  <br>year by aliens and it's covered up by government <br>authorities relatively few people believe in those  <br>conspiracies the most common conspiracies that <br>people believe in are governmental conspiracies  <br>and so for example that the the US government <br>covered up evidence that had foreknowledge of 9/11  <br>or were involved in planning it and also a second <br>group of conspiracies which are about some kind of  <br>shadowy non-governmental organization that maybe <br>it's the illuminati maybe it's the Bilderberg  <br>group maybe it's a small group of usually men <br>who sit in the background and who are the puppet  <br>masters so the short answer is yes there are <br>these families of conspiracy belief but what we  <br>do know is that if you believe one conspiracy <br>you're also more likely to believe in others  <br>can I add on to another question that was around <br>if religious beliefs are sometimes grouped with  <br>with conspiracy theories so that seemed to be a <br>question that somebody had yeah I tend not to I  <br>tend not to I tend not to think of things in that <br>way in the area of research on paranormal beliefs  <br>probably one of the most influential people <br>in the empirical study of paranormal beliefs  <br>is a guy called Jerome Tobacyk and he <br>argues that paranormal beliefs are things  <br>something is paranormal if it's outside the realm <br>of our current scientific understanding to be able  <br>to explain and that it's something that a minority <br>of people believe and actually on the one hand  <br>I think that things like religion if there is a <br>god if there are if god operates in the ways that  <br>many religious canons suggest then it conforms <br>to the first which is that we don't we can't  <br>scientifically explain it but actually depending <br>on where you are a majority of people may believe  <br>in religious phenomena so I tend not to think that <br>that's the case at the same time it is possible  <br>that people might believe that some religious <br>authorities may be those shadowy organizations  <br>that sit behind things that influence world events <br>okay so it's not really separable oftentimes  <br>I hear you another question is do you think <br>there would be a link between social media use  <br>the Dunning-Kruger effect and those two things <br>making people believe they are more informed  <br>than scientists thanks Anthony I think so I've I <br>mentioned that the internet has provided a forum  <br>for a relatively small group of people to come <br>together and have their beliefs about things  <br>reinforced social media uses algorithms that <br>mean that if you go in and look for evidence  <br>for conspiracy theories you're going to find your <br>YouTube or Facebook feed is going to increasingly  <br>become dominated by things of those kinds <br>so I think it's reasonable to think that  <br>I think it was said best by so there's <br>a British journalist who wrote the book  <br>Them Voyages with Extremists and <br>also The Men Who Stare at Goats  <br>who was a Guardian journalist who said <br>that after studying conspiracy theories  <br>for a while he started to lose his point of <br>reference after being immersed with people  <br>who believed these things it all started <br>to seem a little bit too like reasonable  <br>the Dunning-Kruger effect refers to the idea that <br>perhaps one of the reasons why we don't realize  <br>that the things we believe are silly is because <br>we're not well equipped to know that we aren't  <br>well equipped so it's kind of why are you dumb <br>well it's because you are too dumb to realize that  <br>you're dumb I'm not sure that there's a strong <br>and consistent relationship between things like  <br>intelligence and paranormal belief or conspiracy <br>theorizing in fact the research on paranormal  <br>belief is suggests that very very it's completely <br>independent and that's partly because I think  <br>this this attribute of openness to experience <br>is the more important thing that's driving it<br>thank you another question was around <br>the basically well I'll just read it out  <br>how do theories about conspiracies change <br>depending on the conspiracy being something very  <br>far from the individual for example Elvis death <br>I know nothing about it or something related to  <br>individuals knowledge and experience for example <br>political decisions in very close so proximity  <br>basically I think I'm gonna so how much does it <br>matter how close something is to one's own world  <br>that's how I would read this question yeah so one <br>of the concerns that I have about the research  <br>that I've done is that there's this consistent <br>family of conspiracy belief that involves  <br>skepticism and cynicism about the American <br>government and so it's one of those factors  <br>that my faction house that coheres really closely <br>together it's not just governmental conspiracies  <br>but actually American governmental conspiracies <br>and I think that what I worry about is that<br>if I were to say the American <br>government is responsible for  <br>dumping loads of poisoned milk powder in <br>developing countries people would go yeah that  <br>kind of sounds like the sort of thing they would <br>do even though I just made that up so I think that  <br>there's something potentially underlying that kind <br>of specific conspiracy of those specific families  <br>of conspiracy theorizing that might be independent <br>of the extent to which you're familiar with all  <br>the facts might actually support something like <br>that and that's one of the reasons why I think  <br>this is the benefit of assessing conspiracy <br>thinking in a more general way do you believe  <br>that there are conspiracies that influence world <br>events do you believe that there are small groups  <br>of people who seek to influence what's happening <br>in the world around us that might get around that  <br>but again at the same time if you're <br>a distrusting and cynical person then  <br>you're probably more likely to believe that as <br>well but it's a really important question here  <br>related to that another question that asks how <br>much does the social context play a role and  <br>potentially again related to another question <br>social media so what about your peers and what  <br>about the social media in this country so I think <br>this is really important to acknowledge as well  <br>I mean I made the point that you and I Hedwig work <br>at a university where we had access to a lot of  <br>information and we know people who actually have <br>expertise in these areas and therefore it makes  <br>sense that we might have particular positions <br>if we're not in those contexts however then in  <br>fact it makes perfect sense that we draw off the <br>evidence that we have available to us and that  <br>might be social media it might be mainstream <br>media but it's also the people around us  <br>and by and large we surround ourselves with <br>people who we like who we trust and who we think  <br>are like us and therefore when those people say <br>something we trust them so I think that actually  <br>on the one hand I think it's very easy <br>to say people who believe in conspiracies  <br>aren't approaching the world in an evidence-based <br>way but I think that that is privileging  <br>certain kinds of evidence so science is itself a <br>process by which we collect evidence on something  <br>the body of scientific knowledge is a body of <br>knowledge that has developed as a result but  <br>actually if I don't have access to that then I <br>should do exactly what people have done through  <br>our evolutionary past which is rely on the people <br>who are closest to us related to this and now  <br>what should we do with this especially when it <br>comes to the belief in the science right so one  <br>of the questions was how do you how much do you <br>think does colonialism play a role here where  <br>people think or some of the science is done and <br>presented by scientists who are coming from abroad  <br>and also linked to that so how should how should <br>teachers communicate these things in schools what  <br>what can teachers learn from this in terms of how <br>to communicate science and also to think about  <br>these perspectives that people might have and the <br>group where it's coming from wow but if I had the  <br>answer to that you know I'd be able to make a <br>lot of money I'll be able to change the world  <br>and I'll tell you why so in the United States <br>for example for the last 50 odd years if you  <br>ask people whether or not they believe that human <br>beings have evolved from simpler organisms over  <br>millions of years it's been pretty consistently <br>between 40 and 50 percent of people who say that  <br>that they believe in the theory of evolution in <br>spite of the fact that there have been ongoing  <br>arguments about the teaching of evolution in <br>schools in fact what we know is that if you teach  <br>people about evolution it doesn't change what <br>they thought because in fact that's one class  <br>but they're going back to the environment that <br>is the foundation for those things so if you're  <br>strongly religious for example then you go <br>into those classes and you go look that's  <br>a great story I really enjoyed hearing it and <br>that's not the way that it is so what I would  <br>point out is that it's really difficult to change <br>people's positions on these things in part because  <br>I think they're connected to people's world <br>views so when we're trying to educate people  <br>about climate change we might be giving a message <br>about climate change but that people's belief  <br>about climate change is part of a broader network <br>of things and so we're tugging at one particular  <br>node and it's got all the inertia and weight <br>that goes along with the other things that are  <br>also attached to it I also think that and I mean I <br>don't know if the audience have experience of this  <br>but the reality is that shouting at people and <br>telling them that they're wrong and stupid tends  <br>not to change the way that they think about things <br>so one of the examples I've used to illustrate a  <br>different way that we might do this draws off <br>the work of people like Matthew Hornsey and  <br>Paul Bain conducted in Australia where they <br>asked Australians what kind of a world would  <br>you like to live in what kind of Australia <br>would you like to find yourself in and then  <br>once people had done that they said so if you go <br>and recycle if you go and pay attention to ethical  <br>consumership if you try and avoid buying things <br>that can't be that have environmental impact  <br>will that make it less likely you're <br>going to get the Australia that you want  <br>so rather than telling people that they're wrong <br>try and find some kind of common ground that might  <br>actually lead you to that so that's one of the <br>things that I would say I think there's definitely  <br>a place for greater science literacy however but <br>I don't think that's just about saying this is  <br>what science tells us it's about educating what <br>the process of science is because I do worry that  <br>I do worry that climate change is a good example <br>of this that many lay people think that when if  <br>someone gets a grant to study climate change that <br>means they get more money that if someone gets a  <br>grant to study climate change that it actually it <br>has a there's an incentive for us to do that when  <br>in fact by and large people who get grants just <br>have to do more work so I think that we could  <br>do a better job of communicating how that process <br>works that was really long-winded sorry Hedwig no  <br>but it was also a very complex question so thank <br>you very much and I think also this is one way we  <br>try to communicate science right with this series <br>so we want to really become better and probably  <br>to talk more about how to do this well so let's <br>learn alongside how to do this better but I think  <br>you did a very good job in explaining it very well <br>so thank you so much again ngā mihi nui and I need  <br>to unfortunately bring this to a close because <br>it's already an hour it was such a pleasure also  <br>amazing questions thank you all very much for <br>your beautiful questions I'm sorry if I didn't  <br>get to all of them or we didn't get to all of them <br>and I'm looking forward to seeing you in the next  <br>talk which is going to come up next <br>week thank you very much Marc, mā te wā</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
