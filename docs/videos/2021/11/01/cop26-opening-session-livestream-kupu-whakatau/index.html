26th cop<br>the conference of the parties who signed<br>the united nations framework convention<br>on climate change a treaty that came<br>into force in 1994<br>the cop26 summit involves three separate<br>streams<br>first<br>the world leaders summit where national<br>leaders including new zealand's minister<br>james shaw<br>will be presenting their nation's<br>official statements or intentions<br>second the blue zone of invitation-only<br>events and workshops organized by the<br>summit secretariat covering key points<br>on the climate change agenda<br>these will include the paris agreement<br>and a review of progress<br>new scientific knowledge indigenous<br>peoples and traditional knowledge<br>holders along with issues relating to<br>gender finance and biodiversity<br>third the green zone<br>open to everyone and featuring global<br>climate action events<br>over the next two weeks the university<br>of waikato will be offering a digital<br>opportunity for all new zealanders to<br>think globally and act locally by<br>entering our specially crafted portal to<br>share the glasgow cop26 experience<br>beamed in from our team on the ground<br>there<br>here in new zealand we can all zoom in<br>to join our local lunchtime audience to<br>hear the responses of our local<br>panelists<br>and we will have a feedback service to<br>enable our audience to share their views<br>the covert pandemic has altered so many<br>plans<br>but at the same time stimulated a range<br>of innovative alternatives to those<br>plans<br>our planning for this response to cop26<br>was launched just a few weeks ago<br>when tamata ahurangi<br>associate professor tom raw from the<br>university of waikato<br>put to the side his invitation from the<br>commonwealth human ecology council to<br>travel to glasgow for the summer<br>instead tom was asked to spearhead a<br>local initiative based on zooming into<br>the cop26<br>and organizing local local webinars<br>using the digital events capability of<br>the university of waikato as the local<br>base<br>out of this came support from the<br>offices of ministers nanaya mahuta and<br>james shaw who will be in glasgow<br>waikato tainui<br>and local government new zealand and a<br>robust local organising group working<br>with the commonwealth human ecology<br>council members in the uk<br>the university's link with the<br>commonwealth human ecology councils goes<br>back a decade<br>when the new zealand founder<br>xena dash was awarded an honorary<br>doctorate by the university of waikato<br>to acknowledge her global work as a<br>well-being pioneer<br>it is fitting that we will hear during<br>the next two weeks from our current<br>zener dash scholar cellini joffa<br>studying here from the maldives one of<br>the small island nations in the indian<br>ocean threatened by rising seas and<br>it's also fitting that the university of<br>waikato is hosting this new zealand<br>connection with the global summit in<br>glasgow<br>this year<br>we have announced the launch of this<br>nation's first degree in climate change<br>allowing students from a wide range of<br>disciplinary backgrounds to

clearly that the maori<br>expression kaityakitanga<br>very clearly talked about human ecology<br>and the important role that we human<br>beings have in working with mother<br>nature to ensure there is a future<br>we're gathered today because we are<br>launching the next two weeks as an<br>opportunity locally nationally and<br>globally<br>to see now if we can work together<br>and ensure this planet remains safe<br>for the children<br>and their children and the children's<br>children's children for the future<br>join us together we can do amazing<br>things kia
