Professor Elizabeth Stanley, Director of the Institute of Criminology at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington, is looking at how a Justice Reinvestment approach can transform justice systems by redirecting criminal justice spending into social justice initiatives that strengthen communities, reduce social harms, and prevent offending.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>We know that prisons do not <br>deter, we know that prisons  <br>do not rehabilitate, we know that prisons do <br>not fundamentally tackle our crime problems.  <br>So we have to do something different. We <br>need to transform the way we do justice.<br>We have one of the highest rates of imprisonment <br>in the OECD.  We don't seemingly make a dent in what  <br>we see as the crime problem. What gets people to <br>commit crime are social factors, they're cultural  <br>factors. It's not about the threat of prison. The <br>conditions and treatment within prisons make it  <br>so that people who emerge out of prison, they <br>generally emerge in worse states than they went in.<br>We spend a phenomenal amount <br>of money on imprisoning people.<br>But actually what we're looking for is <br>something that's quite transformative.  <br>Justice Reinvestment, it's this idea, it's quite a <br>simple idea on the face of it, and this is that we  <br>reduce the money that we're spending on criminal <br>justice and we take the money that we might save  <br>and we place it into our communities. We <br>create different pathways for individuals  <br>so that we do not ultimately use the prison <br>as a response. It revolves around <br>three main ideas. The first one is that it's very <br>locally based, and we can identify very clearly  <br>certain areas, geographical locations, where people <br>are far more likely to have connections with  <br>social welfare, connections with the criminal justice <br>system, connections with our mental health systems.  <br>And it's about prioritising Justice Reinvestment <br>around those locations. The second idea is that it's  <br>community-led. The decisions on how money should <br>be spent, what kind of programmes are developed,  <br>are made through that community, and the state <br>will provide support, they will not take over.  <br>The third idea is that it's data-driven. Every <br>community will have different problems, different  <br>crime problems, different welfare problems, so <br>the first step is getting that data around  <br>that community, bringing it together, putting it in <br>front of community members, and allowing community  <br>members to understand that data, to understand <br>what it means, and then to make the decision.  <br>When you think about that amount of money and <br>think about what we could do with that amount  <br>of money within our communities to provide those <br>circuit-breakers, to make sure that people do not  <br>progress down that approach of offending, and to <br>do that in a socially just way, it's a no-brainer.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
