Professor Rawinia Higgins, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Māori) at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington, leads research into how we can revitalise te reo to strengthen and increase its role and usage.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>My area of research is probably best described <br>as Māori language revitalisation  <br>and more specifically, around language<br>planning and policy<br>and how policy can help support <br>or hinder language revitalisation.<br>Understanding what the long game is and the long-term goal that we're trying to achieve<br>in terms of making language <br>have vitality and be a living language<br>requires a whole lot of effort in different ways<br>and we shouldn't underestimate people's <br>desire to want to participate in that space.<br>Part of it is just giving them the tools <br>and the ability and the opportunities <br>to be able to use the language<br>in different kinds of forums<br>rather than being exclusive for just<br>Māori domains and just Māori events.<br>But actually how the language<br>can be embraced by all.<br>In many ways, te reo Māori has more and more<br>over time influenced the way we've actually spoken English. <br>So you hear more usage of Māori words, as part of<br>New Zealand English vernacular<br>Mana, whānau, mokopuna.<br>But it was only recently that our national anthem <br>became bilingual as part of our normal practice.<br>There will be generations of children today <br>who will never realise<br>that the New Zealand national anthem<br>was only ever in English.<br>One of the interesting things that I<br>had the privilege of being involved in<br>is the development of the latest legislation<br>for te reo Māori — Te Ture mō Te Reo Māori.<br>I was appointed the chair of a Māori<br>language advisory group, by the then-minister<br>for Māori development, to review a new bill.<br>The legislation is quite unique.<br>It takes a very strong research basis<br>of language planning and policy.<br>It draws on expertise from the crown's<br>own machinery, as such<br>of how you can reset a policy platform.<br>And it gives an opportunity to demonstrate an <br>actual Treaty of Waitangi relationship.<br>Where there are Māori and the Crown trying to work <br>together to develop policy <br>that supports both Māori communities<br>to support intergenerational transmission<br>but also the role of the state,<br>or the nation in supporting that.<br>We used the wharenui as the framework<br>to design the legislation<br>which has both Māori and the Crown<br>inside, building this house together towards a common goal<br>which is around ensuring that the <br>language is alive and has vitality for the future.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
