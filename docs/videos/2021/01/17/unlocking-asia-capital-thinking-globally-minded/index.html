Because Indonesia is<br>a less-known market.<br>I'm not saying that necessarily<br>we should be risk-taking.<br>But we should not be too risk-averse to the extent that<br>we will only go to those markets that everyone knows.<br>It is crucial to know your customers,<br>face-to-face is ideal.<br>Even to the extent that before you export it would be <br>actually great to be there to check out the market.<br>To understand, to talk to potential customers, so <br>that you have a sense of what you are dealing with there.<br>Not biting off more than you can chew, and less is more<br>is probably the kind of advice that we should be thinking about.<br>I can think about it as walking the Great Wall<br>— I've actually done that myself.<br>That is a lot of work to climb up the steps,<br>you almost have to divide and conquer.<br>So you actually go bits by bits, but once <br>you actually get used to it you will be able to walk the distance.<br>I'm the Bank of New Zealand Chair of Business in Asia,<br>funded by the Bank of New Zealand, which is a private entity.<br>When this appointment was set up, it was also<br>set up not just by the University and the Bank<br>but also the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, MFAT<br>Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment, MBIE, as well <br>as New Zealand Trade and Enterprise.<br>Wellington is the right place<br>— close to the government<br>with banks' support in the private institutions,<br>as well as in the tertiary context.<br>So Victoria University of Wellington actually <br>provides the best platform for that function.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
