Professor Nicole Moreham, from Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington’s Faculty of Law, is researching the law around privacy protection. She says privacy isn’t dead, despite the threats it faces from technology.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>What my research does is it <br>really looks into the question<br>what is privacy and<br>why do we care about it.<br>At the moment, if somebody's in public<br>then the assumption is that you can film them<br>and there are actually far fewer protections<br>on the use of your image than you might think.<br>If you're just simply walking down<br>the street in an everyday scene<br>then somebody can film that and put it up<br>onto the internet without your permission.<br>We need to accept that privacy is about<br>a lot more than where you are<br>or from where you can be seen.<br>That it's about what you're doing, indications you're<br>giving that the observation might not be welcome. <br>I think the really significant thing about drones, is that <br>for the first time really what we're seeing  <br>is the ability for everyday people to see into <br>places which they never could see into before.<br>The technology is getting cheap,<br>it's readily accessible.<br>The other thing about drones<br>which is particularly significant<br>is that there's a separation of the person<br>who's doing the looking from the device.<br>They can follow you to places<br>that people can't follow you to<br>and there's a slight sense when you see one that you don't quite <br>know what the person who's operating it is up to.  <br>You can't see them, you can't check what they <br>look like, you can't see what they're doing.<br>They make people feel uncomfortable, but I think we <br>have difficulty sometimes articulating exactly why that is.<br>It's the combination of new technologies<br>for getting into people's spaces<br>camera phones and drones<br>being the latest example.<br>And then the fact that you can upload<br>whatever you find to the internet.<br>Every now and again we get people<br>telling us that privacy is dead<br>that people don't value their privacy,<br>that this is a post-privacy world.<br>I really think that's not the  case. I think privacy <br>is definitely something that's worth protecting.<br>People still want to be  able to choose<br>when other people can access them.<br>They want to be able to choose who sees them, <br>who hears them talking, who they share their intimacies with.<br>And although new technologies in some sense<br>threaten that, we still value that as a society.<br>Victoria University of Wellington is a<br>great place to do this kind of research<br>it's a really stimulating environment, intellectually,<br>and we've got this excellent location.<br>We've got the Beehive across the road,<br>we've got the Supreme Court across the road.<br>The Court of Appeal up the road, the <br>High Court nearby as well.<br>That creates an environment<br>which is incredibly dynamic.<br>And we feel connected to what's going on<br>in government and in the law, in general.<br>The other thing is that because the civil service<br>is based here, regulators are here<br>we have lots of interaction with people<br>who are making the law work on the ground<br>which again informs our research in a way<br>that makes it practical and real<br>as well as conceptual and interesting.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
