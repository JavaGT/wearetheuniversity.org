e Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington immunologist Professor Anne La Flamme is devising ways to treat auto-immune disorders using repurposed medications, including trialling a promising potential treatment for progressive Multiple Sclerosis.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I'm an immunologist, which means I'm<br>interested in how your body fights disease.<br>Your immune system is like your army,<br>your little personal army<br>that gets out there and defends<br>against invading organisms.<br>One thing about an army, if it's not trained then<br>it can be dysfunctional, it can cause problems.<br>In the case of autoimmunity, that is caused <br>by the immune system turning back on you<br>and targeting you<br>and attacking you.<br>The disease that I work on, multiple sclerosis.<br>In that disease, the target is a protein<br>that's found only in the brain and the spinal cord<br>which comprise the<br>central nervous system.<br>Because of that, the immune system will<br>attack and cause lesions within those areas.<br>That disturbs function, and you can imagine<br>disturbing function within the brain, the spinal cord<br>is going to cause disturbances in mobility,<br>vision, coordination, even cognition.<br>It all depends on where<br>that attack is placed.<br>So over time, those attacks can cause damage,<br>and can cause permanent damage.<br>In which case, that disability<br>can accumulate over time.<br>So you can eventually become paralysed,<br>you can eventually lose cognition.<br>I'm interested in trying to figure out<br>how the immune system has gone wrong.<br>I'm also interested in ways that<br>you can then shift that recognition.<br>You can change the mind<br>of the immune system<br>such that it will start to ignore<br>what it has deemed to be a problem.<br>We're looking at repurposing medicines that are used<br>for one thing, and using them for multiple sclerosis.<br>In particular, there's a group of medicines<br>that have more recently been recognised<br>as being able to modify the<br>immune environment in the brain.<br>So these medicines are the atypical antipsychotics, <br>and they're used to treat schizophrenia.<br>Some can treat autism, bipolar disorder, a range <br>of different neurological disorders.<br>What's really fascinating, is that it's showing <br>that that process of neuroinflammation<br>can occur in multiple different diseases, and you could <br>use the same drug to target a range of different diseases.<br>It doesn't mean that those diseases share <br>anything more than that single pathway in common.<br>But because they share that pathway, and that <br>pathway is the destructive aspect<br>we can potentially target it and relieve the symptoms, <br>and prevent the destruction that's occurring.<br>Science is not solely about facts and figures because we<br>often find little tidbits, Little clues to what's happening.<br>But just like the detective, you have to put<br>those clues together into some credible story.<br>When I talk about the work that I've done, it is the work<br>that my group has done, my group and collaborators.<br>Those that are based here at Victoria University of Wellington,<br>all throughout New Zealand and throughout the world as well.<br>Within science, one of the fantastic things<br>is that network that you create.<br>There are no borders for that network,<br>and it occurs globally.<br>And you can share ideas and really build something <br>unique and novel, and you find out something new.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
