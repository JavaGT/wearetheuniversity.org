Professor Vanessa Green from Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington’s School of Education is researching the best ways to deal with bullying and to prevent it from happening.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I'm passionate about researching<br>bullying because it is something that<br>affects a large percentage of New Zealand<br>schoolchildren, even in the primary years.<br>And to think that they're spending their days<br>possibly in fear of going out at lunch time<br>or who they're going to play with, or possibly<br>being fearful of going to and from school<br>I think is really, really sad<br>because it shouldn't be like that.<br>Early childhood or primary school<br>should be a really good time for kids.<br>Bullying is incredibly widespread<br>and occurs right across the lifespan.<br>It can begin as early as three<br>and four years of age<br>and occur in school settings, workplace,<br>right through to elder abuse.<br>Bullying has both short-term and<br>long-term impacts on mental health.<br>So some adults can end up with<br>anxiety disorders and depression<br>and it can be harmful for<br>both bullies and the victims.<br>There can be significant<br>long-term impacts for bullies.<br>They can end up engaging in delinquent behavior<br>and end up in the criminal justice system.<br>As parents, we tend to be concerned<br>about their swimming or their reading<br>and we go to great lengths to address<br>that if there are many issues.<br>But we perhaps don't spend enough time<br>on children's social and emotional development<br>to make sure that they are making friends<br>and that they are being friendly to others.<br>Parents can be actively involved in their child's life,<br>with regard to bullying and victimisation.<br>The most important thing is having really<br>open lines of communication with your children.<br>You need to know what's<br>going on in their daily lives.<br>Talk to them about the friendships, the dynamic<br>in the playground, who's playing with who.<br>And if you've got that<br>kind of conversation going on<br>then you're going to be more able to detect when<br>something's going wrong, when something's not quite right.<br>KiVA is an anti-bullying<br>programme developed in Finland.<br>It's a programme that is adopted by schools.<br>It involves a number of lessons<br>that are set out for the schools.<br>The focus is on the bystander, which is quite<br>different from what had been done before. <br>It also involves an intervention aspect to it<br>where teachers have a clear idea about<br>what to do if a bullying incident arises.<br>It's got a really, really<br>strong evidence base.<br>They've done randomised control trials,<br>and it's incredibly successful.<br>At the moment at Victoria University of Wellington,<br>we're looking at an evaluation of KiVa.<br>So we've just rolled it out to about 14<br>schools now in New Zealand<br>and we're looking at,<br>basically, does it work.<br>If we can have it in New Zealand<br>schools then what we've got<br>is a generation of children<br>who have learned to defend others.<br>To stand up against bullying.<br>They would then move<br>into the high schools.<br>There would a positive effect on the high school<br>environment, and into the workplace.<br>So we would have individuals who<br>no longer tolerate bullying.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
