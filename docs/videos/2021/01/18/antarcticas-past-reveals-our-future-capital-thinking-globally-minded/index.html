Yes, if we don’t cap global warming at 2 degrees or less, says Professor Tim Naish from Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington’s Antarctic Research Centre. One of the biggest questions in climate change science, and one which the Centre is focused on answering, is how much and how fast will the Antarctic ice sheet melt, and what will be the contribution to sea level rise.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>If we can limit global warming to <br>two degrees, then we can essentially  <br>save the Antarctic ice sheet and prevent <br>a lot of sea level rise.<br>If we can stay under two degrees,<br>sea level rise will be less than a metre.<br>If we go over two degrees, it does<br>look like it's a bit of a threshold.<br>You don't just get a little bit more sea level rise,<br>you get a lot more sea level rise.<br>One of the biggest questions in <br>climate change science at the moment<br>and a question we're very focused on<br>here at Victoria University of Wellington<br>is how much and how fast will Antarctica's<br>ice sheet melt and contribute to sea level rise.<br>We get data, we make observations of how,<br>for example, Antarctica and its ice sheets are changing.<br>We go down there, we spend time in<br>the field looking at geological sections.<br>Taking drill cores and also taking<br>cores through the ice sheet.<br>We then make interpretations<br>of what the climate was like.<br>For example, with an ice core we can measure<br>the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.<br>So we can reconstruct many different aspects<br>of the climate system and interpret that data<br>and we can build a picture about the<br>really important climate parameters.<br>Ocean temperature, surface temperature, air temperature,<br>the ice sheet extent, all those sorts of things.<br>Which we can then feed<br>into a computer model.<br>A computer model then simulates the ice sheet, or <br>the climate for the whole of the continent<br>and you can ask the question of the model.<br>You can say, if we put this much<br>carbon dioxide in the atmosphere<br>if the air temperature gets this warm, if the <br>ocean gets this warm, what happens to the ice sheet?<br>And that's incredibly important if you <br>want to know how much did the ice sheet melt? <br>How much ice went into the ocean?<br>How much did sea level rise?<br>There's also a moral question here.<br>We have the opportunity to protect from the worst<br>effects of climate change for generations to come<br>by decisions we make in the coming decades.<br>That window of opportunity will run out<br>very quickly and we won't hit two degrees.<br>We'll be heading for three to<br>four degrees, and if we do that<br>we commit future generations to a much <br>warmer climate with much higher sea levels.<br>The last time the world was two to three degrees <br>warmer, global sea level ended up 20 metres higher.  <br>The ocean would be on the doors of the Beehive,<br>where our decision makers are.<br>Has Antarctica reached<br>the end of its shelf life?<br>The answer is yes, if we do not limit global warming<br>to two degrees or less. Science is pretty clear on that.<br>That two degrees appears to be a trigger point<br>for the stability of those ice shelves.<br>Once they go, then we can expect a much greater contribution<br>from Antarctic ice sheet melting to sea level rise.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
