It's made <br>of timber dust and then a biopolymer called PLA. <br>PLA is a biopolymer made from corn derivatives.<br>We're trying to get back to some quite natural materials,<br>which  I think is a really interesting idea.<br>Working with Stratasys, which is the biggest 3D print company<br>in the world, they've given us beta test software.<br>That means we can do work that is ahead<br>of the machines that are currently available. <br>And we feed back into them the types of things<br>we need in machines, so they can develop new ones.<br>With the software that Stratasys have given us,<br>we can make creatures that can move.<br>So they can become like animated puppetry.<br>We lead the world at that, it's a particular <br>thing we've developed the expertise around.<br>Filmmaking with 3D printing I think would be <br>very interesting.<br>We work pretty closely with Weta Workshop,<br>we have done for quite a few years.<br>I think our role at Victoria University of Wellington is to push them,<br>and keep making sure they're ahead of the game.<br>Once you start getting additive manufacturing<br>as the technical term for 3D printing<br>that's quite similar to biology and the way<br>cells divide and build from nothing up.<br>We're starting to see more synergy with bioengineering<br>than traditional mechanical engineering.<br>I think there's a lot of ethical issues coming too,<br>and I think that's something Victoria's very good at.<br>Looking at things like the politics of it,<br>the philosophy of it, even theology, I think.<br>If we start 3D printing biology,<br>there's some big questions there<br>and I think we're the perfect place to <br>answer those more complex philosophical ones.<br>I think it's going to be a really fascinating <br>world going into these more complex opportunities.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
