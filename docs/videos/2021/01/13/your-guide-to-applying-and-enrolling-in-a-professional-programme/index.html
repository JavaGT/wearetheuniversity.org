because we're going to<br>get it right at the start<br>so the first thing i've got up here on<br>my list of things to talk about which<br>might seem rather obvious<br>is thinking about what you want to study<br>and why<br>let me just flick this through you don't<br>get to see some amazing<br>thing oh script ahead here you don't get<br>to see anything amazing beyond my head<br>so i want to just talk about what you<br>want to study and why because before you<br>enroll we want to make sure that you've<br>chosen something that you're super happy<br>with<br>and to give you an example sometimes we<br>have people come in to see us<br>we have a bit of a conversation and<br>they've got an idea and then you know i<br>want to do this particular program i<br>think this is going to be a right fit<br>for me<br>but as we have a bit of a discussion<br>about what really motivates them and<br>what they're really passionate about<br>we learn that you know what well this<br>program could be good<br>but there's another program over here<br>that might suit your learning style<br>better<br>as an example some people might be<br>looking at a tort program and then when<br>we have a bit of a chat<br>it actually turns out that perhaps a<br>research program might be better for<br>them<br>so what i mean by that is something<br>where they get an opportunity to<br>complete<br>a major research project and really<br>contribute<br>in a way that generates new knowledge<br>whereas other people might not be so<br>keen on that that might be a bit scary<br>so they might do something that's more<br>structured<br>and then sometimes we have people come<br>in and have a talk about their career<br>aspirations and then we discover hey you<br>know what<br>much as we would love it if everybody<br>came and joined us here in this amazing<br>wellington school of business and<br>government<br>you actually might be better off going<br>to one of our other faculties or one of<br>our schools because i think they've got<br>something that might resonate with you<br>and help you get to where you want to go<br>and something might align with your<br>passions<br>so i guess the key message here is yeah<br>sure you've got some ideas about what<br>you want to study but think about the<br>why<br>think about what it is that motivates<br>you and please<br>please reach out to us and come in and<br>see us<br>if you want to have a chance that we can<br>help you drill down and<br>feel confident in your decision so think<br>about what you want to study<br>and why<br>all right next point here planning your<br>degree which is<br>kind of obvious right one of the things<br>that we see here all the time is<br>because we're dealing with a well what i<br>would describe as a really<br>successful audience of people you know<br>they're really driven they've got<br>supersonic career ideas most of the<br>people who come in here are either<br>new grads who are high achievers and<br>super motivated or amazing international<br>students that are still with us<br>thankfully or people who've got<br>really established careers and they're<br>very driven to go<br>oh you know what i know it says that i<br>can do this degree in uh<br>four years part-time but i'm going to do<br>it in one year full-time while i'm doing<br>all these other things at the same time<br>and here is my advice to you you don't<br>need to get all anxious and stressed out<br>about<br>smashing out your degree in the shortest<br>amounts of time possible<br>you need to plan your degree in a way<br>that is realistic<br>that is going to allow you to work<br>professionally and enjoy it and<br>balance the realities of family life and<br>relationship life<br>or if your me creates lots of time to go<br>surfing whatever it might be<br>so that's what i want to convey to you<br>with planning your degree<br>think about how many courses you are an<br>actual back going to be doing<br>there's nothing wrong with doing one<br>course to start off<br>and get a handle on what this experience<br>will be like<br>it's dead easy to add in extra courses<br>later on so that's what i mean by<br>planning<br>your degree and then a little bit of<br>we get asked all the time okay well i'm<br>interested in<br>you know organizing my study around work<br>where can i find the timetable<br>if you have a look at our degree<br>information online and you click on an<br>individual course<br>you can access the timetable and this<br>will help you plan your degree and<br>manage your workload<br>the example that i've got in front of me<br>here is actually from the master of<br>public policy this is one of the public<br>policy courses<br>and we can see here there are three<br>blocks of teaching spread out across the<br>trimester<br>and it stipulates when those blocks are<br>what dates they run and we can see here<br>they run from 8 30 to 5<br>30 and whereabouts they're located<br>that's a fairly typical block<br>teaching format for those of you doing<br>an emba<br>you also have a similar block teaching<br>format except your blocks run on fridays<br>and saturdays<br>i guess the takeaway here is have a look<br>at when the classes run<br>think about your workload and don't go<br>crazy on loading yourself up with<br>courses because<br>that could be your undoing later on and<br>we want to make sure that you're<br>successful<br>and that you're happy healthy and<br>wealthy during this program<br>how was that for sage advice so the next<br>thing is your online application<br>now you'd think online applications are<br>easy notes here to remind myself of<br>things to tell you<br>you know the online application is not<br>necessarily super intuitive and it's got<br>some language<br>which is kind of confusing i would<br>recommend<br>doing your online application in a quiet<br>space<br>you don't want to be in a room with a<br>dog and kids in chaos equally you don't<br>want to be at work with people coming to<br>you with problems you want to be in a<br>nice quiet space so you can work your<br>way through it<br>it does ask you to provide things a<br>couple of little tips here<br>towards the end of the online<br>application you are going to need to<br>upload a recent passport photo so make<br>sure you've got some kind of glamorous<br>headshot<br>ready that's passport compliant they're<br>going to use this for your student id<br>so have that at the ready you may need<br>to have a digital copy of your academic<br>transcript ready as well to upload<br>and of course you'll need to provide the<br>original for your academic transcript<br>later on depending on what program<br>you're applying for<br>you're also going to need to have a cv<br>and in some instances you're also going<br>to need to have<br>a reference i'm going to revisit this<br>point<br>i guess the key takeaway here is make<br>sure you've got all that stuff ready and<br>that you're happy with it because you're<br>going to need to have it<br>when you do the online enrollment<br>application<br>so choosing your programs and choosing<br>your programming courses<br>i talked about making sure that you<br>choose the right program<br>want to make sure you've got the best<br>fit for you that<br>aligns with who you are and your career<br>aspirations and that is something that's<br>going to motivate you<br>and then of course you've got to choose<br>courses within your program so people<br>get a little bit anxious going oh you<br>know i've chosen these courses for the<br>year can i change them<br>yes you can it's pretty straightforward<br>there's an add and drop course function<br>when you're given your student login<br>because you can access your own program<br>to add courses and drop them<br>so maybe you've got an idea now about<br>what courses or papers you think you're<br>going to be doing through the course of<br>the year<br>as i said earlier some people might be<br>going i'm gonna do three here<br>five here and ten here very easy to<br>change them through the course of the<br>year<br>very easy to reduce your workload if you<br>have to or conversely<br>bump it up if you're feeling more<br>confident and you want to do some extra<br>courses<br>or perhaps you're looking at a<br>particular area where you thought you<br>were going to specialize in x or y<br>and you've actually had a little delve<br>in and you're like hey you know what<br>that actually hasn't worked out for me i<br>think i'll change it<br>very straightforward to do don't be<br>anxious about that at all<br>choosing your program make sure it's the<br>right one changing your courses that's<br>pretty strange<br>admission types little word on admission<br>types<br>most of our students will come to us<br>through the following pathways<br>actually i'll get this little screen up<br>here because it explains a little bit<br>better there we go<br>towards the end of your application<br>you're going to get to the stage and it<br>says<br>what admission category so we've got<br>two general streams of admission for our<br>students<br>the first one i'll just point the little<br>arrow here is special admission<br>so that applies to people who have<br>obviously been<br>working and they've been very successful<br>and driving towards their career and<br>perhaps they didn't<br>need to do any previous university study<br>there was no requirement for it<br>but now they're applying for a program<br>where the admission requirement is hey<br>we need you to have an undergrad degree<br>but if you don't what happens or what<br>happens is this<br>you apply via special admission and then<br>our academic program leader for each<br>program whether it's the emba academic<br>program leader or our government<br>programs<br>academic program leader whatever it<br>might be we'll look at your supporting<br>documentation<br>your cv and make a determination of<br>how we can make sure you can come in as<br>a special admissions student very<br>straightforward process<br>very common pathway don't be too<br>concerned about that<br>now if you've already got an undergrad<br>degree<br>you would not apply for special<br>admission so don't take special<br>admission if you've already got an<br>undergrad degree<br>you would go for the second kind of<br>pathway into our programs<br>which is qualification assessment here<br>it is here<br>above entrance level qualification<br>assessment above the entrance level<br>and you will need to provide your<br>academic transcript an original copy of<br>it<br>and this is where we're going the<br>entrance requirement most commonly for<br>all of our programs<br>when you're doing a post-grad<br>qualification is you've already<br>completed an undergrad qualification of<br>some description<br>this will apply to you so those are the<br>two pathways you need to consider<br>supporting documents let's have a bit of<br>a word about that as i alluded to you<br>need of those supporting documents ready<br>um let me just give this screen up here<br>for you<br>uh here we go as you proceed<br>through the oh the timer went off oh my<br>god i'm going over 10 minutes that's<br>okay let's go to 12. no one will know<br>can you hear that beefing<br>there we go got rid of that additional<br>information you'll get to the additional<br>information screen<br>and i've used the government programs<br>here<br>we're going to get to this and it's<br>going to say school of government<br>programs<br>please upload your cv showing your<br>experience<br>relevant to this program so this is<br>where you need to have your cv at the<br>ready<br>and this is what i mean by making sure<br>you're prepared before you do your<br>online enrollment because you want to<br>have a current cv that really conveys<br>your strengths and the relevance of your<br>experience and<br>all of the awesome things that you're<br>going to bring when you join the<br>learning cohort<br>so you want to make sure that it's right<br>anyone who has updated their cv for a<br>while<br>i use canva c-a-n-v-a<br>canva.com they've got some great<br>templates there it doesn't cost anything<br>it's really intuitive if an idiot like<br>me can use it anyone can use it<br>i'd recommend you use it if you want to<br>just upgrade your cv a little bit<br>you're going to have to upload your cv<br>in the case of the government programs<br>as well they're asking you there you can<br>see their school or government reference<br>form<br>so you've got to print that off and get<br>your employer to fill it out<br>so this is an example of supporting<br>documentation make sure you've got it<br>ready and you want it to convey<br>okay quick word on payment<br>this is pretty straightforward<br>we get asked all the time okay well will<br>i be able to get a student loan if i'm<br>doing a couple of courses<br>or let's say the master professional<br>business an example and<br>of course you can but there is a minimum<br>points requirement<br>the minimum points requirement to get a<br>student loan<br>for our courses is you'd need to be<br>doing<br>a uh 30 points so that could be two<br>15 point courses of tribute to one or it<br>could be one<br>fifteen point course in tremendo one and<br>then another in trimester two<br>so just make sure you've got that kind<br>of sorted<br>uh so when you're dealing with study<br>link um they're not gonna be saying to<br>you hey you've only enrolled in one<br>course but i'm gonna be able to give you<br>a student loan that would be a hassle<br>so there again 15 points of one<br>tremendous 15 points in another<br>or 30 points in one trimester that<br>should get you covered for your student<br>loan<br>also because we have a lot of mature<br>students coming to us who may not have<br>done any study before<br>make sure you check out the fees free<br>scheme<br>because loads of students that i've been<br>dealing with have been eligible for this<br>and in some instances they've got enough<br>money to cover the certificate stage<br>and the staircasing option towards many<br>of our masters programs<br>so if in doubt find out plenty of<br>students have managed to access this<br>and in some instances even students<br>who've done this little bit of study a<br>long time ago<br>have still been able to get a little bit<br>of money towards<br>their new study goals and objectives so<br>fees free just google that you get<br>straight through to the page that you<br>need to<br>channel your inquiry to make sure you<br>find out if you don't ask you'll never<br>know right<br>then finally here new to<br>study what do i mean by that let me get<br>no let's go through this one this is<br>super useful<br>loads of you may be getting ready to<br>enroll and perhaps you haven't studied<br>for a while maybe you studied<br>quite a long time ago maybe you've never<br>studied before<br>i would suggest looking at our student<br>learning page i just put it up here you<br>can just google student learning<br>and away you go to access this material<br>but they've got some great webinars<br>fantastic resources<br>writing guides all kinds of things that<br>you can access before you get started<br>another great tip that i would suggest<br>is we have<br>amazing libraries at victoria university<br>and you will need to use these resources<br>in terms of producing a breadth of<br>research related work<br>for many of your courses so i would<br>suggest finding out about how our<br>libraries work you'll be able to do this<br>as part of the orientation process<br>but it's something you need to have on<br>your list of things to do before you<br>start<br>finding out how our libraries work how<br>to use the academic databases<br>really super useful when it comes to<br>producing<br>really in-depth quality well-researched<br>work that's going to contribute to your<br>success as part of whatever program is<br>that you do so<br>total train wreck as far as getting that<br>done in 10 minutes but hey you got to<br>see<br>this face and listen to my voice for a<br>little bit longer so that is a bonus<br>quickly going over some of those key<br>messages think about what it is that you<br>want to study and why and if you're<br>unsure<br>reach out to me reach out to our team<br>and we can sit down and have a chat<br>that's no problem at all<br>planning your degree you don't need to<br>go mad and overload everything<br>get ready and be prepared to do your<br>online application because it's going to<br>ask you for these things you want to<br>have them on the ready<br>don't overload yourself with your<br>courses it's going to be okay if you do<br>one or two<br>it's not a race you need to set yourself<br>up in a way<br>that's going to support your success if<br>you're the kind of person that can smash<br>an entire degree out in five minutes go<br>mad i support you and celebrate it<br>but don't think you have to think about<br>your admission type<br>that point that i made was if you've<br>already got a degree you're not going to<br>be taking special admission<br>you're going to be taking qualification<br>assessment above<br>entrance level have your supporting<br>documents ready you want your cv to be<br>good you want to have your reference at<br>the ready if you need that for your<br>particular program<br>do investigate payment you might be able<br>to access some money<br>remember that you need the 30 points<br>minimum requirement to access<br>student loan for your fees and then as i<br>remarked at the end if you're new to<br>study<br>use some of victoria's resources to get<br>ready<br>and i think that will put you in good<br>stead for academic success<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
