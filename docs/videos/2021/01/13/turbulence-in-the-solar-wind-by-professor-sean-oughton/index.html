It is fast – moving at speeds as high as 900 kilometres per second – so it would take only a few seconds to travel the length of the North Island.<br><br>Professor Oughton will set the scene by explaining what the solar wind is, how it interacts with the earth and why turbulence is a key part of the associated ‘weather’ in space. Following that, he will outline how his research makes use of maths and computer simulations to develop models of the solar wind, which he compares with spacecraft data.<br><br>Currently a Professor of Mathematics and the author of more than 100 publications focusing on hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, Dr Oughton’s primary research interests centre on understanding turbulent flows. He is particularly enthusiastic about the potential outcomes his work will have on improving our understanding of turbulence and its role in the solar wind.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity:

just sort of vaguely setting the<br>scene here there's a picture of the<br>sun in the middle and you can see stuff<br>streaming away<br>that is the solar wind and we'll have<br>an introduction to that there's really<br>three parts to the talk here an<br>introduction to the solar wind<br>an introduction to turbulence and then<br>plugging those two together<br>so i think probably you've all seen<br>things a bit like this before a picture<br>of the solar system<br>planets orbiting the sun and<br>the picture of the sun is a real one but<br>it's a different scale in the planets<br>if the uh earth was to scale with the<br>sun there oh sorry<br>um then<br>it would be like one of these little<br>bright dots that you can just about<br>see there that's the actual size of the<br>earth you could fit a hundred earths<br>across the diameter of the sun so it's<br>really a<br>much much bigger object in the solar<br>system<br>and as it looks out here it looks like<br>there's empty space between all these<br>planets but that's not really what it is<br>it looks dark on the picture but it's<br>actually full<br>of the stuff called plasma<br>and you may remember or not from your<br>own schooling and stuff is that there<br>are four states of matter<br>there's a solid so if you take water and<br>put it in the freezer then you have a<br>solid<br>lump of water ice if you heat that up it<br>turns into liquid<br>that you can drink and if you keep<br>heating it it turns into the steam above<br>the<br>kettle when you're boiling that that's a<br>gas so that's about 100 degrees<br>if you could keep heating that water up<br>to about 10<br>000 degrees then you'd start ripping the<br>atoms to bits and ripping the electrons<br>off the atoms<br>so that ionized gas where the electrons<br>come loose that's called a plasma<br>and all of the stuff on the sun is in<br>that state<br>the electrons are being ripped loose<br>like that<br>so that's what fills the space between<br>the planets<br>we have these protons and electrons<br>positive and negatively charged<br>things and they make electric currents<br>and magnetic fields<br>and fill up that space there well<br>i'm saying that they fill up the space<br>um<br>kind of they're there and it's true that<br>they they occupy it all but it's pretty<br>thinly spread out right and each little<br>cubic centimeter so about the end of one<br>of your fingers<br>there are 10 protons and 10 electrons<br>roughly<br>if you're near the earth like this this<br>planet here<br>as you go further out it gets thinner<br>for<br>comparison all this air in here that<br>we're breathing<br>there are a billion billion times more<br>particles in each cubic centimeter<br>right 10 to the power of 19. so<br>space is full but not compared to what<br>we have here on the earth<br>okay so the<br>the sun's atmosphere is all these<br>protons and electrons separated and<br>moving around<br>making electric currents making magnetic<br>fields<br>um and it's really hot it's about a<br>million degrees<br>in fact it's so hot that even though the<br>sun is this massive object with a really<br>strong gravitational field<br>it's not strong enough to hold on to<br>that atmosphere and the atmosphere<br>streams outwards<br>through the through the solar system<br>it does that fast right if you look at<br>you got to read this carefully it says<br>300 to a thousand kilometers per second<br>not per hour per second so roughly<br>the gas that's above the poles here this<br>north pole of the sun you can see these<br>rays moving away and above the south as<br>well they're going at something like 800<br>kilometers a second<br>so auckland to wellington one second on<br>the other hand because it's so thin<br>right there's only 10 or so particles in<br>each cubic centimeter<br>if you could put a tree out here near<br>the earth<br>somehow you've got this fast thin wind<br>even though it's going at 800 kilometers<br>a second it wouldn't rustle the leaves<br>on that tree<br>because there's so little energy is<br>actually associated with so little<br>momentum<br>okay uh and that wind just keeps going<br>it fills the whole solar system or<br>really we have another technical term<br>for it we call it the heliosphere<br>i'll say some more about that soon um<br>and<br>there's another um prefiguring of<br>something to say<br>we're going to talk about space weather<br>as well the stuff that looks like it's<br>coming off the sun<br>yes it is it can collide with the<br>planets and we'll<br>right so i mentioned the solar system<br>that that's what we're all<br>well aware of i think and really that's<br>about gravity it's about<br>the sun being so big and heavy that it<br>captures these objects and makes them go<br>around in circles or<br>slightly squish circles the planets and<br>the asteroids and those things<br>the heliosphere is really about the<br>solar wind which means it's about the<br>gas<br>that comes from the sun the ionized gas<br>and the magnetic fields there so you get<br>this bubble in space<br>where all of the plasma comes from the<br>sun and<br>that's sort of the more space physics<br>interest is is in that rather than in<br>the planets going around the sun that's<br>okay so where does it stop if this wind<br>is<br>heading out into space what's going to<br>stop it and the answer is really<br>until it runs into another wind it keeps<br>going and this<br>this other wind is from between all the<br>other stars there is an interstellar<br>wind<br>okay and it's if it's heading in in this<br>direction here then<br>is to kind of smash the two ones<br>together and they get to a sort of a<br>pressure balance and you make this<br>surface<br>this blue one here is where they're kind<br>of an equilibrium imbalance<br>the pressure from the interstellar one<br>matches that from the solar wind<br>and you get this separation surface<br>where everything inside this is from the<br>solar wind<br>and everything outside it is from other<br>stars into stellar space<br>that happens a long way away right the<br>usual unit that we use to measure things<br>in space<br>is the astronomical unit a u and that's<br>the distance from the earth to the sun<br>so that's one unit<br>this boundary out here the edge of the<br>heliosphere<br>is about 120 of those units away<br>okay now some of you will have good<br>eyesight and you'll be seeing that<br>there's this other boundary in here this<br>dark blue<br>sphere and that's an important one as<br>well<br>what happens is the solar wind streams<br>out in all these radial directions<br>and just like those rays are getting<br>further apart the mass is getting spread<br>out thinner and thinner and thinner<br>the speed's kind of the same right it's<br>it's 700 kilometers a second here it's<br>700 out here<br>but the mass in here is the density is a<br>lot higher than it is out here<br>something has to give you can't keep<br>spreading the stuff out<br>and expect it to obey conservation of<br>mass<br>so what has to happen is it has to<br>suddenly<br>transition from a high speed flow to a<br>low speed flow<br>which has a lot more density associated<br>with it<br>and that's called the termination shock<br>um<br>and so as you go through that that thin<br>boundary on the sphere here the edge of<br>these yellow<br>arrows you drop from say 600 kilometers<br>a second down to 100 kilometers a second<br>but you make the gas thicker and<br>everything starts behaving itself<br>in fact you have all seen this but you<br>may not have realized it right so<br>at home in your kitchen sink there is a<br>model of the whole heliosphere<br>there so here's the sun<br>kind of extended now right where it hits<br>the sink here you get the sun<br>and there's this circular disk of<br>fast flying water and it flows out<br>radially like the solar ones<br>until you get to this transition region<br>here where it jumps up and you have this<br>big fat<br>layer of water that's moving a lot<br>slower that<br>boundary is like the edge of the solar<br>one that first edge<br>the the shock wave where they go through<br>there<br>okay so yeah the sun hits there<br>you get the sparse shallow flow and then<br>it transitions<br>to a fatter slower flow out there so you<br>can all go home and observe this<br>in your sink tonight and you know do<br>your own little space physics experiment<br>there<br>okay how do we know any of this right i<br>mean everyone likes to<br>be reassured that theories and theorists<br>haven't just run away with themselves<br>and<br>made stuff up we need to verify this and<br>so there have been a whole lot of<br>spacecrafts<br>put up into space from nasa and the<br>japanese<br>space agency the european space agency a<br>few others<br>and they've made measurements of all<br>sorts of things<br>the electric field the magnetic field<br>how fast it's going<br>this mass density of the plasma and<br>this is the sort of stuff that they<br>report on here so in here<br>is the sun north pole south pole and it<br>rotates around<br>about once a month and the graph<br>on here is showing us uh the speed of<br>the solar wind<br>um at the various places above the sun<br>okay so<br>sort of above the north pole we've got<br>this more or less steady flow<br>of about 800 kilometers a second you can<br>see it fluctuates a bit<br>plus or minus 50 maybe and the same sort<br>of behavior above the south pole<br>but in the middle near the solar equator<br>much bigger fluctuations and it's harder<br>to say what the average value is<br>and my interest is in these fluctuations<br>here<br>um how that turbulence how the waves and<br>turbulence that characterize those<br>fluctuations get generated<br>um and how they change how they evolve<br>as they move outwards past<br>just to come back to that uh<br>unsteadiness of the wind there the fact<br>that it's not just a nice<br>smooth flow forever<br>like our own atmosphere where we don't<br>have that<br>uh steady flow all the time either we<br>have storms<br>we have uh fast winds and slow winds we<br>have hurricanes and tornadoes<br>there are analogues of all of those<br>things happening in space and between<br>the planets<br>and that's called space weather<br>at least when we're trying to get<br>and what happens is you know every so<br>often the sun will<br>will have one of these giant eruptions<br>here it'll spit off this huge chunk of<br>mass<br>right remembering that the smallest<br>bright dot you can see on there is about<br>the size of the earth<br>and sometimes those head towards the<br>earth okay<br>mostly they don't but sometimes they do<br>and they can cause problems when they<br>when they get there<br>luckily the earth which is not to scale<br>here has<br>its own magnetic field it's like there's<br>a giant bar magnet inside the earth and<br>it makes us<br>this pattern sort of spider shaped<br>pattern of magnetic field lines here<br>and that makes a bit of a magnetic<br>bubble around the earth<br>that stops the worst parts of the storm<br>getting in and<br>damaging life mostly but also technology<br>on on our planet and<br>because some of these coronal mass<br>ejections<br>there's research projects and funding<br>goes into<br>determining when that's going to happen<br>what the what the<br>manufacturers of the satellites that<br>orbit the earth<br>want to know is when should i turn my<br>satellite off<br>because it cost me 100 million dollars<br>to put it up there<br>i don't want it to get electrically<br>fried by this magnetic storm coming<br>through<br>and it'd be an expensive piece of scrap<br>metal okay<br>so what they want to do want to know is<br>when one of these eruptions happens is<br>it going to hurt the earth first<br>if it is when so that we can say to them<br>switch the satellites off between nine<br>o'clock and ten o'clock<br>so that's the sort of the negative side<br>of these uh coronal mass ejections<br>interacting<br>with the earth the positive side is and<br>you know some of you may have seen these<br>is that you get aurora northern lights<br>southern lights<br>shimmering curtains of greens and reds<br>that you can see in the sky<br>i haven't actually seen any of them<br>myself unfortunately but<br>maybe some of you have and that's the<br>gas<br>this plasma from the sun filtering in<br>just a little bit<br>through the earth's magnetic field into<br>our atmosphere and interacting<br>there<br>okay so that was part one that's a<br>brief introduction to the solar wind the<br>turbulence<br>i think again we all have uh an<br>intuitive idea of what we mean when<br>someone says turbulence<br>maybe it's something like this where<br>we've got a river with this<br>bubbling around energetic active<br>behavior going on nothing's very smooth<br>if we look here you can maybe see some<br>circulating water<br>um we call that a vortex and if you<br>looked<br>closely enough you'd be able to see<br>smaller ones and bigger ones would be a<br>whole range of different sizes of these<br>objects<br>the other thing that you can see when<br>you're<br>standing next to a river like this is<br>sheer layers there are regions of the<br>fluid<br>where the top is going faster than the<br>layer underneath or the other way around<br>doesn't really matter<br>and that shear is a fundamental<br>aspect of the turbulence and how these<br>vortices get generated we'll get to that<br>shortly here so<br>here's a visualization of some vortices<br>in the atlantic ocean<br>right north america here's<br>florida and cuba mexico over here and<br>you can see<br>actual really large vortices on the<br>ocean here<br>and then some smaller ones still smaller<br>and then these stretched out<br>filaments or tubes on vorticity as well<br>vorticity meaning really just rotating<br>fluid<br>and it's that point about a whole lot of<br>different sizes<br>right big ones small ones smaller small<br>and the color scale scale here was<br>chosen<br>not by me but by someone who was<br>obviously familiar with van gogh's<br>starry night painting<br>um where van gogh had used his artistic<br>genius vision insight to paint the<br>the turbulence that was in the night sky<br>so just a little bit more formally um<br>what's the difference between turbulent<br>flow<br>and not tubulin flow laminar we often<br>call it so if these are<br>think of these as being two pipes with<br>water flowing down them<br>um if the speed isn't too much then the<br>water will flow nice and smoothly down<br>here<br>and you won't have any disruptions and<br>that's often what you want in an<br>engineering situation<br>because it means that the friction isn't<br>playing a big role<br>that what you put in it at one end of<br>the pipe comes out smoothly the other<br>without too much of a disruption<br>however if you turn up the speed then<br>those straight lines start turning into<br>these wavy ones<br>and things can twist around you can see<br>some little curly bits vortices drawn on<br>here as well<br>of different sizes again and<br>uh those vortices uh which are kind of<br>cartoon here that the key feature about<br>those<br>is that they break up right when you<br>have a big vortex<br>after a little while roughly about the<br>time it takes the vortex to do one<br>revolution<br>it'll break up into a couple of smaller<br>ones those ones are going to rotate<br>faster<br>so they break up in a shorter time into<br>smaller ones again<br>and that process is called the turbulent<br>cascade and that's the heart<br>of the physics of turbulence this<br>breakup of vortices<br>uh into into smaller vortices and then<br>those ones break up again<br>so here's another cartoon of that<br>the vortices breaking up to smaller<br>still smaller smaller again<br>and all the way down to these tiny ones<br>when does it stop<br>well when the vortices get so small that<br>that rotation is actually<br>subject to friction then all of the<br>energy in that rotating little piece of<br>fluid<br>turns into heat right and so you make<br>the water a bit hotter<br>so it stops when friction becomes<br>important is the idea<br>that's a cartoon do we have any evidence<br>that it actually happens<br>there's some numerical simulation<br>evidence right so we take the equations<br>that describe<br>fluids and turbulence in particular we<br>solve them using numerical methods<br>and you produce a visualization like<br>this which shows<br>how swirly the water is at any<br>particular place okay you can so you can<br>see these<br>tubes here that are rotating um there<br>are large ones<br>there are smaller ones there are thinner<br>ones if our visualization was better<br>we'd actually be able to look inside one<br>of the large ones<br>and see smaller ones inside them they're<br>nested the vortices are inside each<br>other<br>you have this big hierarchy of different<br>rotating structures there<br>okay vortices vortices vortices i keep<br>saying that because they're the heart of<br>the of the turbulence<br>where do they come from so i just want<br>to run through this<br>process here we're going to show you a<br>couple of panels<br>think of it as like a movie with time<br>running to the right here<br>it's named after a couple of famous<br>physicists from 100 odd years ago calvin<br>and helmholtz<br>the idea is that you start with two<br>layers of water<br>one moving down here to the right and<br>then the layer on top of it<br>moving a bit faster so that's the key<br>thing is that you have the shear<br>at the interface between the two layers<br>all of the dark green is moving at one<br>speed<br>all of the gray blue is moving<br>faster and then you perturb that<br>interface you give it a little wiggle<br>so some of it goes up some of it goes<br>down and<br>um what's going to happen<br>well this bit that's gone up it's now in<br>a part of the fluid that wants to move<br>faster<br>so it gets dragged to the right<br>okay and you get this curling over sort<br>of shape the bit that went down<br>it's going to move a little bit slower<br>it gets a little bit left behind<br>and gets stuck in here and as that keeps<br>going<br>uh you generate this vortex that you can<br>see at the end here this rolled up<br>piece of fluid and that really is the<br>the fundamental way that you generate<br>vorticity if you didn't have any in the<br>flow to start with you need a sheer<br>layer<br>okay you can see these things uh when<br>you go down to the waikato river<br>or in the ocean or in the clouds and<br>this is a picture<br>um i think in the clouds this one<br>there's some objects sticking up through<br>the clouds here top of the mountain<br>and it's as the flow is moving across in<br>this direction<br>it's generating some vortices that don't<br>stay stuck to the object to the mountain<br>they peel off so here's some earlier<br>ones that are peeled off and they're<br>getting a bit fainter because they're<br>interacting with each other<br>and generating smaller vortices as they<br>do that<br>okay so that one's kind of nice to look<br>at but i think this one's even nicer<br>um this is the curling up from the shear<br>layer that you can see in the cloud<br>sometimes<br>you don't see it often um i've<br>you know i'm always looking i've seen it<br>twice once in new zealand once in the<br>u.s<br>and what's happening here is that<br>we've got still air in the lower layer<br>of the atmosphere<br>and up here the air's moving along okay<br>and you're getting that shear and that<br>pulling of the slow area<br>to roll up and create these vortices<br>here so there's another<br>little piece of homework for you you can<br>start looking up at the clouds and see<br>if you can see this<br>repeated pattern of vortices being<br>all right that's all about regular<br>fluids<br>water air things we're familiar with<br>the wine or the beer that's in your<br>glass you can make that turbulent as<br>well<br>but that's not what we have in space<br>right we have a plasma in space and so<br>it's a bit different it's not just<br>neutral atoms it's got these positive<br>and negative charged<br>things protons and electrons so<br>you might expect that to be a more<br>complicated situation and that's correct<br>the electric currents and the magnetic<br>fields that<br>are associated with those charges moving<br>around generate<br>messier two bills and here's a picture<br>of some magnetic field lines<br>and some electric current structures<br>which are just<br>up there to show you that that it is<br>more complicated right<br>so that's uh second part of the talk the<br>introduction to turbulence now we're<br>going to plug those<br>together and talk about turbulence<br>in space and the solar wind in<br>particular<br>and see how that goes so the idea<br>is uh is to use theoretical physics and<br>computer simulations<br>to to take the equations that we know<br>describe these things<br>and solve them hopefully with pencil and<br>paper we can do that sometimes<br>not as often as we'd like and then in<br>that case<br>when we can't solve them with pencil and<br>paper then we we turn to the computer<br>and we<br>use numerical methods there and the<br>objective is to explain as as we're<br>talking about at the start there<br>how that solar wind moves out past the<br>planets<br>how the turbulence and the waves are<br>generated and compare that with our<br>spacecraft data because it's physics<br>we're trying to tie it back to what we<br>know is actually happening<br>so this is a plot from one of our<br>computer simulations<br>you run it for a few weeks and produce<br>some pictures like this that you then<br>analyze and what this shows is the the<br>density of the plasma<br>over a really big region of space okay<br>this is<br>out here the green is out here in the<br>interstellar space<br>this yellow globe which you might guess<br>is the sun is in fact nearly a thousand<br>and the blue is the region where the<br>solar wind is<br>okay so if looking at the color scale<br>green is not<br>very dense so the plasma is pretty thin<br>out here blue is even less dense<br>that's the solar wind and those two are<br>running into each other<br>okay and where they do that they get<br>compressed and so you go up to the red<br>color there so this green stuff is<br>getting compressed as it runs into the<br>solar wind<br>and we're getting this sort of wall in<br>front of it<br>where there's a high density region of<br>gas that's going on<br>okay it's a pretty picture how do we<br>know it's accurate<br>that we're really solving equations that<br>describe what's happening in that part<br>of space<br>well the spacecraft that we've launched<br>and sent out there<br>start here at the earth and they go out<br>on path something like this<br>voyager 1 went along this sort of a<br>direction<br>and was taking measurements all the way<br>okay so it's measuring the density of<br>the plasma the electric field the<br>magnetic field<br>the speed and a few other things too<br>so that path we can make it cut<br>through our simulation data and compare<br>what we have in the computer results to<br>what's actually measured in the<br>spacecraft<br>and that's what we've got on this next<br>slide um we're showing<br>two quantities here comparing what we<br>get from the simulation to the to the<br>actual spacecraft data<br>on the left is the energy in the<br>turbulence<br>the measurements are these red circles<br>and the black<br>is the uh our model our computer results<br>and on the right is the temperature of<br>the protons okay<br>again circles are the actual data and<br>the and the black curve is<br>as the numerical model and all of this<br>is as a function of distance from the<br>sun<br>right remembering that our unit is one<br>is the earth's<br>uh distance from the sun saturn's at<br>about 10<br>pluto's out around 40 or 50. um<br>and you know agreement's not awful but<br>it's not fabulous either<br>um we are pretty happy with that<br>although there's some stuff to explain<br>out there and we're still working on<br>that<br>this one it looks pretty bad in here<br>around 40 or 50.<br>in fact that's okay we know why that is<br>it's a feature of what happened with the<br>measurements versus what the simulation<br>does they shouldn't agree there and it's<br>how do we get those equations so how do<br>we produce those plots right we have to<br>solve the equations on the computer for<br>a while<br>it's hard right in principle you've got<br>all these protons and electrons moving<br>around<br>out there they all every one of them<br>obeys newton's second law that forces<br>mass times acceleration but there are so<br>many of those particles you can't<br>possibly expect to be able to solve that<br>for every one of them so you have to<br>make some approximations<br>and there's a whole sequence of these<br>things and<br>that's part of the art of the modeling<br>of what's going on but<br>the one i want to focus on here is that<br>we divide the flow<br>up into an average piece and a<br>fluctuating piece the tubules<br>so here we've got some gray axes this is<br>the velocity at some point in the solar<br>wind as a function of time and it's<br>bouncing around here<br>you can think of that as being suppose<br>we average over a day<br>we might get this blue line okay that<br>looks pretty simple we should be able to<br>simulate what's going on for a blue line<br>like that<br>write down an equation to describe that<br>pretty well<br>yes we can uh and then you get<br>fluctuations<br>relative to that average okay and you<br>can write down some equations that<br>describe what they're doing<br>and you treat those a bit separately<br>they have to be still connected<br>but you treat them separately now the<br>actual average and the solar one isn't<br>this nice flat line right it's more<br>complicated than that<br>but that's the idea that you have the<br>average and fluctuations and you<br>address them somewhat separately<br>okay so what do we want to know about we<br>want to know about these quantities i've<br>already mentioned things like the<br>density of mass<br>how much mass is in each cubic<br>centimeter how fast it's going<br>magnetic field strength and we want to<br>solve for the average quantities what's<br>it doing<br>on average as it moves out the solar<br>wind<br>but to do that you have to know a little<br>bit about the fluctuations<br>right they are coupled what they the<br>average quantities affect the<br>fluctuating ones<br>but it works the other way too the red<br>arrow the fluctuating ones affect the<br>average<br>so you can't really just solve this and<br>ignore that<br>you can't really just solve this and<br>ignore that you've got to do them both<br>together<br>accurately all right<br>so two slides of equations<br>this is the equations for the average<br>quantities or some of them<br>and really what this says is is that<br>this tells you how the mass density<br>changes as you move out through space<br>some of you will recognize some calculus<br>stuff in here rates of change and<br>derivatives those sorts of things<br>and this tells you how the magnetic<br>field changes<br>look there's some red stuff in here okay<br>that's the fluctuations<br>affecting the large scale averages<br>and this one's about the velocity or<br>technically the momentum<br>again the large scales are being<br>affected by these red pieces the<br>fluctuations<br>and that's a coupling to the small<br>scales we can write down what they look<br>like too<br>but they involve some new quantities<br>that don't appear in these equations<br>and we need more equations to to<br>understand and describe what's going on<br>there<br>and that that's a bit messier um<br>you know there's no test about this or<br>that it's just to show you that you know<br>we we are doing some serious mathematics<br>behind all this and we want to um<br>use this and analyze this in some cases<br>we can we can simplify a little bit<br>further here and make some analytic<br>progress meaning pencil and paper<br>solutions and those are really helpful<br>but most of the time it is what you<br>guess from looking at a mess like that<br>that you you can only solve it using the<br>computer<br>and that you know when you do you get<br>these plots that we looked at<br>before there for things like the density<br>okay so i'm nearly finished here just a<br>what the stuff i'm working on most<br>recently is really at each end of the<br>solar wind<br>right the voyager spacecraft which is<br>showing their trajectories<br>as shown here in these red lines boy to<br>one went kind of north<br>of the sun and to south they're in fact<br>out here now in this interstellar space<br>um and they have been out there um well<br>one of them a couple of years one of<br>them a bit longer and so they're<br>actually measuring stuff that has<br>nothing to do with the sun<br>right it's pretty exciting for us space<br>people<br>and so the measurements are a bit<br>different out there<br>there's a bit more going on a bit<br>different and so we want to explain that<br>and then you can't see it on the scale<br>here but<br>right and close to the sun just a few<br>years ago this new mission was launched<br>parker solar probe<br>and that's gone so close to the sun that<br>it's nearly almost<br>where the solar wind starts okay and<br>that<br>that's really exciting for us<br>and you know that's returning<br>measurements and we're all working on it<br>and trying to figure out<br>uh if our theories match the data which<br>is always the benchmark<br>um and there's lots to understand and to<br>uh<br>to improve on with our um<br>modeling of what's going on in those<br>those ends of the solar wind the start<br>for me the research has definitely been<br>a team effort um<br>you know being a professional sportsman<br>is a fantastic thing and unfortunately<br>i've never been<br>close to being that but being an<br>academic is a little bit like that<br>you're paid to play with ideas and<br>equations and models and things<br>and it's fantastic and i love it<br>and i've worked with a lot of different<br>people in a lot of different countries<br>and it's all been really a lot of fun<br>and<br>challenging and enjoyable and so i'd<br>like to thank all of those<br>people my collaborators and their<br>institutions and in particular the the<br>university of waikato<br>for uh supporting me in in this research<br>and all the projects associated with it<br>my name is anika hinsa and i'm the head<br>of the school for computing and<br>mathematical sciences<br>thank you sean for this very fascinating<br>talk and i<br>definitely learned a lot and<br>well sean is one of a group of<br>astrophysicists that we have in our<br>school<br>and as you saw he bridges fields of<br>astronomy<br>physics mathematics with quite a bit of<br>computation thrown into the mix as well<br>sean researchers fundamentals he does<br>science and the truest meaning of the<br>word<br>building and understanding models and<br>knowledge about the world<br>in many in many ways one of his<br>colleagues said space is the perfect<br>laboratory to study turbulence and<br>discover<br>patterns that can then be exploited for<br>similar situations<br>on earth so in this sense sean's<br>research<br>sean is quite a typical waikato<br>researcher really<br>without much fuss he's doing amazing<br>research<br>with an excellent international<br>reputation<br>so rather like his favorite soccer team<br>so even nasa knows about shane and his<br>research<br>he has several times been invited on<br>assessment panels for nasa research<br>proposals<br>and from the german research society dft<br>he received a fellowship which is aptly<br>named after the 16th century<br>cosmographer and cartographer<br>gerhard so<br>sean's signs is as rigorous as his<br>soccer schedule<br>and indeed i suspect that quite a few of<br>you<br>actually know him um from his soccer<br>team here in the waikato<br>so if you have any questions we don't<br>have time for those<br>right here but you can join him outside<br>in the open spa right after the lecture<br>so please join me in thanking sean again<br>and i'd also like to thank all of you<br>for joining us<br>for this last talk of the season as it<br>were so the last talk in this<br>hamilton public lecture series for 2020<br>and<br>in the meantime i would like to wish you<br>all merry christmas<br>keep safe and we look forward to seeing<br>soon<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
