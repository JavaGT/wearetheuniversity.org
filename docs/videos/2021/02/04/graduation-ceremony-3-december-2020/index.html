many of our graduates jack doesn't<br>know exactly what he plans to do with<br>his future<br>but what he does know is that he will<br>keep moving forward<br>and trying to make a difference for the<br>lives of those<br>around him ladies and gentlemen please<br>welcome jack walker<br>good morning everyone i am jack walker<br>and i am the graduate address speaker<br>for this belated<br>graduation ceremony this graduation has<br>been a long time coming and as the<br>saying goes<br>third time's a charm i know it's been a<br>long warning for most if not all of us<br>and although these some of these<br>ceremonies are joyous occasions<br>they can also drag out a bit long at<br>times and i know that most of you just<br>a young man named ferris bueller once<br>said that life moves pretty fast<br>if you don't stop and look around once<br>in a while you could miss it<br>can you please all take a couple moments<br>now to look around and appreciate this<br>moment in its entirety<br>this is one of these moments that you<br>now that's done let's get the show on<br>the road<br>firstly i would like to congratulate<br>each and every one of you sat here today<br>a degree is something that you should be<br>proud of whether it's your first<br>or your fifth it is a culmination of<br>hard work<br>sacrifices tears smiles countless hours<br>of procrastination sessions<br>flat parties but most importantly<br>learning<br>to the graduates congratulations for<br>finishing this long and arduous journey<br>while you may have finished your degree<br>it doesn't mean that your education<br>should stop here to the parents families<br>partners<br>friends those who cannot be here today<br>and those no longer with us<br>thank you for your support thank you for<br>the phone calls the text messages<br>the care packages the comfort and for<br>your love<br>words cannot describe how much a support<br>means to us and so hopefully these<br>pieces worth thousands of dollars<br>can begin to do so instead<br>bernard of chartres stated the following<br>if i have seen further that is by<br>standing on the shoulders of giants<br>he compared us to dwarves perched on the<br>shoulders of giants and pointed out that<br>we have seen further<br>and more than our predecessors not<br>because we have keener vision nor<br>greater height<br>but because we are lifted up by them and<br>have been given their wisdom their<br>discoveries and their guidance<br>to the university staff the proverbial<br>giants who we stand upon<br>thank you for facilitating and the<br>gaining of our degrees<br>thank you for all that you do not just<br>for us but also in<br>your fields of expertise for making the<br>when i heard from the graduation office<br>telling me that i had been gifted with<br>this honor<br>i was taken away and humbled to have<br>been blessed with such a privilege<br>one of the suggestions from them was<br>that the speech should speak to the<br>graduates sitting here today<br>it should be something that they can<br>relate to and understand it should be<br>something that sums up their time at<br>victoria<br>these final six words set with me sums<br>up their time at victoria<br>what could i possibly say that could<br>come up that could sum up each and every<br>student's university experience in five<br>to ten minutes<br>after all i'm just one of the graduates<br>sat here today<br>well the truth is is that i simply can't<br>sum up your experience<br>each and every single person sat here<br>today has lived their own experience not<br>just in their tertiary years<br>but in their own life as well each of<br>you will be looking back on these<br>moments be they good<br>bad amazing interesting or downright<br>confusing<br>and you'll be seeing how they made you<br>who you are today<br>this is something that i cannot do for<br>anyone other than myself<br>one of the requirements of a speech such<br>as this is that i do one of three things<br>i attempt to tout someone else someone<br>else's wisdom as my own with some<br>obscure<br>um obscure anecdote or didactic story<br>i provide some reminders of things that<br>have happened so we may reminisce<br>or i confess my love to someone in the<br>crowd safe to say i won't be doing that<br>last one and as for the other two i<br>think i'll leave them alone as well<br>here's what i'll do instead provide some<br>insight into what i've done over the<br>last four years<br>thank my friends and family for their<br>support and leave you with a challenge<br>one on my mirror since day one of<br>university i've written and a whiteboard<br>mark of these simple words<br>one percent and the letters m a d<br>one percent better i'm sure most of you<br>can work it out and i<br>but i want to show you the power of this<br>one of what this one does<br>there are 365 days in a year and so<br>let's do some quick maths<br>what is 1.01 to the power of 365.<br>37.78 approximately here's another piece<br>of math<br>there are a thousand and 95 days and<br>three years and so what is 1.01 to the<br>power of 1095<br>roughly 54 000. what<br>what a difference three years makes no<br>wonder they make us stick around for<br>this long<br>now this one percent better isn't about<br>being 54 000 times better<br>when i came to university this was about<br>a challenge to be constantly learning<br>constantly evolving<br>constantly changing it is about the<br>little things in life<br>one percent is easy if you make a small<br>difference every day<br>eventually the bigger things become a<br>little less big and a little less<br>daunting<br>like the speech this is where i believe<br>happiness<br>comes from being microscopically<br>ambitious towards pursuit of short-term<br>goals<br>rather than long-term dreams for loving<br>the graft of the day<br>in and the day out going one more when<br>you are physically spent<br>and mentally spent grinding stuff out<br>when there is nothing left and then<br>grinding some more<br>this one percent however isn't about<br>achieving that one percent it's about<br>enjoying the process of work about<br>achieving greatness about making change<br>i never set out to achieve great things<br>to end up on the stage getting this<br>speech<br>i set out to do my best each and every<br>day and just to try to do a little bit<br>more with what i've got<br>where i am two m<br>a d what do these letters mean to me<br>they define an acronym or better yet<br>they represent an ethos<br>m is for make a is for the word ah<br>and d is for difference combine they<br>make a simple sentence make a difference<br>the sentence can have many connotations<br>and will mean different things to<br>different people<br>to me it means two things making a<br>difference in my own life as seen by the<br>one percent<br>but also making a difference in the life<br>of others this is why i'm standing<br>before you today<br>i was chosen to speak to you not because<br>i went to the olympics not because i met<br>the queen<br>and certainly not because i have<br>achieved any kind of societal greatness<br>but rather because i've gone about my<br>time at victoria trying to make a<br>difference in my own life and in the<br>life of those around me<br>whether i have actually achieved change<br>in the lives of those around me is<br>certainly up for debate<br>and i certainly don't see myself as<br>being one who has made a whole lot of<br>change<br>but rather someone who has changed his<br>own life by helping those around him<br>what i do see is the power of these<br>three words now it's in time for some<br>more meth<br>if each graduate sat here this morning<br>went out into the world and changed the<br>life of just<br>10 people in their lifetime be their<br>families their colleagues or just some<br>random on the street<br>how many people do you think would be<br>affected and say four generations<br>or the graduates projected lifespan<br>assuming that each person<br>you affected change lives of 10 around<br>them and so on and so forth<br>this process continues for generations<br>all those four generations<br>and in your lifetime you will have<br>affected the lives of eight million<br>people<br>that's a lot of people now for those<br>close to me<br>to those who have indulged my<br>curiosities who have supported me<br>who have lifted me on their shoulders to<br>my friends<br>thank you for keeping me humble thank<br>you for your support your wisdom design<br>advice your company and your chats<br>it has been a pleasure and i hope that<br>once we leave victoria we do not cease<br>to become friends<br>so my book whole family a lot of two<br>years it has been<br>as the

working<br>beside you this year and the last<br>the last the jokes the terrible chat the<br>events the awesome the office gossip<br>sessions will be truly missed<br>i look forward to seeing what you

is<br>something that i truly admire<br>and if i could not live and and if i<br>could live up to even a small percentage<br>of the standard that you have set<br>i think that i will be doing

each a challenge<br>david foster wallace in his speech this<br>is water remarked that a purpose of a<br>university education isn't just about<br>teaching us what to think<br>but rather what to think about these are<br>words<br>are wise words and are words that i<br>think hold particular strengths<br>in terms of this graduating class as we<br>head into a very unknown and unprece<br>unprecedented world and planet i<br>challenge each of you not just to think<br>about what is expected of you<br>but also to think about what is<br>unexpected of you<br>after all that is the power of education<br>it empowers us to dream<br>to explore to invent and to discover<br>don't just accept the default ponderings<br>of the people around you<br>think your own thoughts explore your own<br>passions dream your own dreams<br>notice the subtleties of life appreciate<br>them and take joy in knowing that you<br>are<br>a part of one big system meet the<br>triumphs and disasters<br>and treat them just the same be curious<br>as to what came before you<br>and what will come after you<br>appreciate the life around you as it<br>passes you by<br>after all if you don't you just might<br>miss it<br>thank you<br>jack
