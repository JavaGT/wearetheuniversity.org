every family<br>represented by every graduate within<br>this room<br>we thank you in particular i'd like to<br>thank my own parents<br>your support sacrifice and dedication<br>in helping to achieve this milestone has<br>not gone unnoticed<br>to the lecturers tutors and course<br>administrators<br>thank you for answering our endless<br>questions<br>for extending deadlines even if we<br>didn't really deserve them<br>and for patiently explaining a simple<br>concept to us for the hundredth time<br>we still hadn't quite managed to grasp<br>it<br>to victoria university even though we<br>don't always see eye to eye<br>you have provided us with the means to<br>gain this degree given us an environment<br>in which we can learn grow and develop<br>within communities of like-minded people<br>so we thank you<br>most importantly i'd like to thank my<br>fellow graduates<br>without you today would be nowhere near<br>as special as it is<br>while i have not crossed paths with<br>every single one of you while at<br>university<br>it is an honor to cross the stage with<br>you<br>among us are friends mentors and most<br>importantly the support systems<br>they have carried us through the most<br>challenging times of university<br>whether you helped with the cram<br>sessions right before the test<br>provided snacks and coffee as we slaved<br>away in the library<br>or shared notes for the lectures we were<br>simply too lazy to attend<br>thank you many of us here<br>have questioned whether this day would<br>ever actually come<br>we have doubted our own abilities and<br>the likelihood of reaching graduation<br>the standard degree is sold to you as<br>being three years<br>but for some of us in the crowd today it<br>was more than that<br>this could be due to needing to take<br>time for our personal lives and amongst<br>the study<br>to prioritize other passions care for<br>family<br>or manage our own health there are many<br>sleepless nights<br>there is tears there is laughter and<br>there was pain<br>this has led us down a longer less<br>glamorized path<br>than what you pitch your standard<br>commerce degree to be<br>i myself was supposed to be graduating<br>in 2018<br>however in 2017 i withdrew from vic<br>my time at university had been intense<br>and after years of dealing with anxiety<br>i realized that if i didn't choose at<br>that point to prioritize my mental<br>health<br>the career i was working towards would<br>not be worth it<br>i was three quarters of the way through<br>my degree but<br>at that point in time i could not say if<br>i would ever return<br>i stand here today with the rescue<br>because i did in fact manage to return<br>however had i not taken that time for<br>myself and instead prioritised the<br>idealistic university lifestyle<br>i probably would not have managed to<br>others have not been as fortunate as us<br>and some have had to make the tough<br>decision to permanently withdraw<br>these people deserve our recognition too<br>each and every one of us has been<br>through our own unique struggles in the<br>past three plus years<br>and not one of us has had an easy ride<br>the piece of paper we receive today does<br>not give justice<br>to the growth and change we've each gone<br>through as individuals<br>therefore today is not only a day of<br>celebration<br>but a testament of our strength and<br>resilience<br>so to my fellow graduates<br>congratulations<br>to each and every one of you this is a<br>moment<br>most of us will never have again so well<br>done<br>i want to highlight in particular not<br>only what we have achieved<br>as individuals during our time at vic<br>but also<br>what we have achieved as a collective<br>throughout the last three years<br>we have united as a cohort for the<br>serious societal issues facing our<br>generation as a whole<br>in 2017 we raised our voices<br>against the rape culture that was<br>intoxicating the youth of wellington<br>in 2018 we called out the professional<br>services firms<br>who fostered a culture of sexual abuse<br>against the young female students who<br>were just trying to get their foot in<br>the door<br>classes and tutorials to protest against<br>the consistent failure<br>of governments to take action against<br>climate change<br>and this year we stand together again<br>fighting against covert 19.<br>each and every one of us has played a<br>crucial role<br>staying inside and abiding by the<br>lockdown rules<br>we have worked hard to protect the<br>health of our family<br>friends neighbours and also the<br>strangers on the street<br>we see the decision of one person to<br>disregard quarantine rules<br>but we also saw our decisions as<br>individuals<br>to remain indoors and isolate save lives<br>we each made the conscious decision to<br>do this<br>therefore this year's seniors unite as<br>both a generation<br>and as a nation and we'll need to<br>continue to do so throughout the coming<br>years<br>with this in mind i have one thing i ask<br>of my fellow graduates<br>do not stop do not stop raising your<br>voices<br>against the issues which plague us<br>do not stop being the generation of<br>change<br>be proud of everything we have<br>accomplished<br>be proud of everything we as a<br>generation stand for<br>and no matter where you go from today<br>continue to
