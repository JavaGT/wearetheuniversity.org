ever<br>who would have thought amy winehouse<br>would have turned up today cannot be<br>empire<br>all of you that are here today under<br>this wonderful prestigious<br>event i'm so privileged to be here i've<br>totally<br>totally lost my speech it's all coming<br>what i wanted to start with was a little<br>awaiter that my daughter<br>she sings she's part of the islam poetry<br>team<br>and some quite inspired by these young<br>wahine that come from there and so it<br>goes<br>that's what the corridor started with<br>today with messi uh<br>victoria university being hitting a waka<br>victoria university in wellington being<br>acknowledged as one of the<br>leaders when it comes to treaty<br>partnerships and so that<br>so i wanted to talk to you about well<br>you know what do you talk to look<br>at you how beautiful are you it run big<br>round of applause for our graduates<br>i didn't do my graduation and i regret<br>it every single day<br>and i look at you so i'm channeling all<br>of you today this is a little bit about<br>me<br>as much as it is about you uh you know<br>pike i you've got me at paikea down the<br>back there<br>that was just amazing when you see uh<br>the wairua the ihi the wanna<br>all of those things that make these days<br>special<br>i'm so glad that all those musi bars are<br>hanging around the necks of our<br>cousins we had to laugh ali<br>on that note though i did want to talk<br>to you about carving carving your po<br>how do you carve your po so<br>as i walked in here this morning and how<br>i got to be here in the first<br>instance is actually all about<br>relationships when my sister hirawini<br>higgins<br>messaged me to say could i come and<br>speak at graduation<br>there's only one answer and it will<br>always be yes<br>because that's what fanongatanga is<br>about that's what whakapapa is about<br>it's about everything<br>and why that was an important piece to<br>mention is that um<br>i i grew heads and bones here at the<br>heritage many many years ago i came here<br>when i was at hatohohipa and i would<br>work for my brother-in-law peter ads at<br>the time and<br>unbeknown to me i was actually inputting<br>all the grades from all of the exams<br>damn it i should have really paid<br>attention that could have been a lot<br>better<br>um but that's where my path started<br>crossing so that i win the ni and of<br>course rebecca kiddle<br>uh also i'm just so proud to be here<br>when these wahine are doing their thing<br>and they're at the top of their game and<br>they are phenomenal<br>the other part to that was when i walked<br>through for my prophety here at the<br>hitting<br>when i joined as a student it was<br>higgins voice that also rang out across<br>the artie here so it was bringing it all<br>home and it was just wonderful<br>and i had the privilege of seeing poe<br>timur<br>dance his magic across the atea<br>and welcoming us you know bug-eyed fresh<br>and somewhat sleepy as we came here to<br>start our journey<br>and start that piece of our po<br>who would have known that they too are<br>greats of our time<br>how lucky are we to be around them but<br>my journey started in a place called<br>cuckoo i think you had two of my nephews<br>that were here i've got a few to call<br>here<br>whanau as well but mine started in<br>cuckoo yes the centre of my universe<br>as a village baby as well te nakote<br>capifano<br>um you know it does take a village to to<br>grow our people<br>and um i i did i grew up like this i was<br>a<br>fair-faced maori who knew nothing other<br>than that i just thought it was maori it<br>didn't matter to me<br>all my cousins were big and somewhat<br>brown we called them black at the time<br>i could run faster than them so it was<br>okay<br>and from that point you know everything<br>was based around the mud eye<br>how lucky was i to be in that position<br>you don't underestimate what those<br>moments are for you<br>i we were village babies because we all<br>had other mums<br>auntie matthew was my other mum auntie<br>carol was somebody else's other mum<br>and i'm so lucky here they've got two of<br>the mums sitting in this audience today<br>so that's a wonderful tribute to them<br>and then we all went to oho<br>went to the marae to to place center<br>and then we went off to ohio school you<br>two would have had it<br>school whether it was in a city in the<br>regions<br>and that's where you learned to run<br>faster you learned to play<br>bulrush and do all those cool things<br>together but it was the foundation<br>pieces that started to build and start<br>carving your po<br>it was when maybe one of the pakia kids<br>might have challenged you and said<br>you're not maori enough<br>you don't look maori i look around these<br>faces here not all of you<br>are as dark as some of my cousins and so<br>there is no judgement on color around<br>who we are we come in all colors<br>we come in all shapes and sizes sorry<br>father<br>fire you know valerie and the bodies and<br>all those things we<br>evolve over time but it's the goodness<br>of life that that gives to us<br>from ohio school my po started to to be<br>carved some more<br>and i was i'd say one of the first<br>exports from cuckoo alongside my<br>brothers and sisters<br>but i went to hatohohipa mata college<br>and meet my other sisters<br>sisters for life and when they call you<br>say yes<br>and hopefully one day that will get<br>reciprocated<br>but again there was another piece to the<br>journey<br>i turned up there uh with a wonderful<br>group of wahine<br>for those periods of years i started<br>there looking quite funky<br>quite long here and so what happens in<br>the moment of time<br>is that when georgina king calls you to<br>the office<br>tina maria wilson my name's tina marie<br>got got modified<br>another first and i get called across to<br>walk along the marion steps and she<br>looks at me she gives me a hug and a<br>smile pulls my hair down and cuts it in<br>that moment<br>you learn very very fast to eyes on airs<br>on all the time<br>and carved another piece of my po<br>from hatto hoypa i jumped on planes and<br>that was because<br>i was influenced hugely by my brother<br>and my sister and my brother<br>they were a little older than me and um<br>as i watched them carve their po<br>i too thought that that was a fantastic<br>idea they were fearless<br>in what they did my sister for different<br>reasons my brother the same<br>his best advice to me university was<br>anything more than a b<br>or a c has wasted time in the pub it was<br>deep it was deep and meaningful and i<br>hold true to that today brother<br>he too is in the crowd um but they<br>encouraged me to be brave<br>and they got their encouragement from<br>our parents who carved their po<br>with the cards or the chisels that they<br>had<br>mom and dad changed our lives uh dad<br>never ever went to high school<br>one of eighteen and my mum uh well<br>uh you'll probably hear her before you<br>see her kia ora<br>mum but she gave us the world and she<br>gave us courage and she gave us fight<br>and she gave us spank<br>like many of your mums did and all of<br>you<br>who are in the crowd today as working<br>parents parents of babies the next<br>generation<br>i salute you it is not an easy task<br>and it's um and whether you're from uh<br>whether you're an absolute mama of that<br>baby or you're part of a wider whanau<br>committed to all of those mukapuna<br>i salute you and we must we must<br>continue to do this<br>um joining on my po again coming back a<br>couple more notches were chiseled i<br>jumped on a plane<br>to argentina to south america the first<br>time my<br>mum had real fear in her eyes she always<br>knew she had somebody on watch<br>you know with her down the river going<br>to town going to all the parties that we<br>snuck to<br>that she thought well we thought we<br>didn't know that she knew she knew<br>everything she was like an oracle<br>um but she didn't have anyone to watch<br>for this first time<br>but it was my brother and my sister who<br>gave me the courage to jump on that<br>plane and go<br>and experience life now this was before<br>cell phones<br>this is before social media and even you<br>know internet didn't even exist<br>so imagine the feeling that they had<br>back then but there are many people<br>around us in this audience who've done<br>those same things<br>but that continued to carve my po ever<br>so more<br>and i was just so enlightened with the<br>world<br>it made me miss home it made me treasure<br>the beauty about us as a peoples<br>and uh you know you just come back<br>really to share more<br>but i realized quite fast then that we<br>had to continue to give back<br>so if we go out and experience something<br>you've got to do a plus one<br>or a plus seven or a plus ten you've got<br>to take people on the waka with you<br>or else it just becomes a really dumb<br>lonely story<br>how do you then share that knowledge to<br>people and inspire them<br>and be there first to help them start<br>covering their po<br>you've been instructed learning now and<br>you've proven that you can do it<br>from diplomas to undergraduate bachelor<br>degrees<br>to postgraduate degrees to honors to<br>masters to doctorates<br>you are you are the chosen ones you are<br>the leaders you are the courageous<br>because you've got resilience and doing<br>all of that in a year like 2020<br>i salute you you will be etched into my<br>po<br>i got the call to come back after what<br>was meant to be a 12-year little stint<br>it was<br>a 12-month stint it was 18 months later<br>get on the plane<br>somehow some missions got to me<br>somewhere whereas your cousins are<br>coming to find you<br>those same cousins my sister had had her<br>first baby<br>aniodia who is also in the audience<br>today<br>which is just wonderful and that's what<br>brought me home<br>and i came here i came here<br>to that moment where telupo i sung to us<br>it's her voice called called my tupuna<br>on<br>as well as poe timura dancing his wai<br>pikare<br>along this atia that was the next stage<br>of how i got to be<br>i was quite naughty here at victoria at<br>the hirangawaka<br>i used to work a lot and so i always<br>sneak in i was trying to get somebody to<br>always give me their notes there was<br>stuff going on but that's<br>what you did you you built fanongatanga<br>um<br>i took the strong advice of my brother<br>you know his advice around pubs<br>and time and so we'd spend a lot of time<br>down at what was called the dungeon back<br>of the day<br>if you would if it was still here you<br>would have seen ants etched under a<br>table<br>carving into somebody else's po<br>stephen and tina were here<br>those types of things but that's what<br>makes this part rich of your journey<br>you do all of this whilst trying to grow<br>up you do<br>all of this learning whilst trying to<br>understand who you're going to be<br>well gosh i want to be like you and i<br>grow up you're just inspiring<br>you're so amazing listening to those<br>degrees that were called out<br>whether you're a triplet who knew that<br>there was a triplet<br>in this mix uh graduating with his his<br>degree<br>that's a phenomenal effort far note it's<br>huge and it's a massive commitment to<br>all of that<br>after to hitting a waka i went on to<br>massey university to complete my degree<br>because my sister had started her<br>her first business and we needed to down<br>the tools to go and help<br>she was the first maori child accounts<br>who practice in aotearoa new zealand<br>bloody amazing that is phenomenal stuff<br>that's called some deep chiseling on<br>that po<br>and she's got some local scars to prove<br>it along the journey it wasn't an easy<br>time<br>but we did it after that um<br>and so i now have the privilege of<br>sitting on mass universities board so<br>so it's wonderful to come back here and<br>i didn't wear blue because it was messy<br>i didn't even wear it because it was<br>but i come here with the biggest and<br>bluest<br>royal hearts for all of you this heart<br>she is pretty pretty<br>brown on the inside there's no doubt<br>about that<br>um so again and that was one of my<br>firsts again<br>that stood there when my sister opened<br>her business and we went on so that was<br>partyardo<br>we must talk about these things because<br>if we don't they get forgotten because<br>there is so much going on in the world<br>right now<br>after pariado i went to work for the<br>first maori investment firm in aotearoa<br>new zealand<br>another big etch on my po i did meet a<br>handsome man we did have four babies uh<br>he was<br>one of the guys that worked at that<br>particular industry we were a team of<br>probably five at the time<br>but lake taupo forest trust like<br>like type of forest trash cities had its<br>first filling of trees<br>so when you're driving into topo on the<br>southern side you can see all those big<br>big beautiful forests<br>well there was a crown relationship and<br>it was the first lot of trees that<br>finally that the the trust of ngati<br>tufarito or those peoples<br>owned and so that was a windfall of a<br>million bucks worth of cash<br>circa and so rather than<br>um put that in the bank and let somebody<br>else manage it<br>the smarts of what who the guy i married<br>timur hall<br>they established their own internal<br>treasury function<br>and so that has then gone on to be a<br>multi-hundred million dollar entity<br>just because people worked out that we<br>needed to have this knowledge<br>another first another edge on my po<br>i ended up becoming ceo of that entity<br>the first maori woman<br>to stand at the helm of that for datitu<br>it was a wonderful tribute and a<br>wonderful honour<br>because but i feel that i could do the<br>task because i had four<br>always all day um and that was a little<br>bit about<br>coming up to that journey that we were<br>also part of<br>we were waka tupuru we were that<br>generation of kids<br>who were had to sacrifice one holiday<br>every year<br>one holiday every one week every holiday<br>and we had to go into immersion hui and<br>go all around<br>here to make sure that we could do what<br>was right<br>maintain our pai pai all of our pie pie<br>whenever it was needed<br>for knowing a tonga it is everything<br>whakapapa<br>it rules my world so coming back so at<br>messi<br>finished my degree and went on to ceo<br>and then<br>i never ever thought i would work for<br>the government i'm a treaty baby i'm a<br>treaty settlements baby<br>we were the fighters we were the ones<br>taking back<br>what was ours and there is many of us<br>who do different parts of all of that<br>first wave was all the lawyers so we<br>grew lawyers here<br>we needed them we had to have them in<br>all the places<br>i was second wave i was the accountants<br>because you know there was money coming<br>in so we needed to work out what to do<br>with it<br>then there was investments and there was<br>other and then we've got the things that<br>make the most<br>difference to everything the social<br>services because<br>impact and social impact we've learned<br>this year if we haven't learned it<br>before<br>it's all about us it's all about the<br>people it's all about<br>it's all about those babies that are<br>crying i love it it brings joy to our<br>heart it reminds us about what happens<br>and why we're here to do these things<br>um so then i went to stanford university<br>in 2015 on 2013 it was<br>we had a there was this regime that was<br>being established on how to<br>um meet the trajectory targets of the<br>business growth agenda for new zealand<br>how were we going to make sure that new<br>zealand was going to do its thing<br>so in 2012 they sent up a lot of<br>business leaders up there<br>they were ceos or chairmen of different<br>entities and predominantly primary<br>industries across new zealand<br>up to stanford and they worked out oh<br>yeah we can do this we can do that<br>and we can design think this up and we<br>can design think that<br>um but it was actually gosh we need 630<br>billion dollars foreign direct<br>investment to come back here to new<br>zealand<br>that's a big number and i kind of looked<br>around and said gosh how are we going to<br>do that<br>and then somebody piped up there was one<br>maori in that<br>possibly two but one act of maori um<br>and said well you need to talk to maori<br>it's<br>and it was really another first it was<br>another etch on the po<br>of changing the cards dr lydialis and i<br>had the honor of going up to stanford<br>that year and<br>we we realized we were totally we don't<br>need anybody else to talk about<br>our stuff we need to take our destiny<br>into our own hands<br>but we soon realized that this was a<br>bigger kaupapa bigger than all of us<br>and we realized that you needed to build<br>partnerships and what do we do best<br>we build partnerships we are the best<br>partner builders<br>you know haramai come into ultra new<br>zealand<br>stay with us put your tent up in the<br>backyard kind of scenario<br>we are the best partners but we've got<br>to be smarter at choosing the partners<br>that we want to partner with<br>and so that was the turning of the cards<br>for me and i realized at that point<br>um that gosh if you're not on the waka<br>and if you're not in the right seat on<br>the waka how are you<br>ever going to influence change for<br>people and so<br>that was my journey and realizing uh<br>when nzt<br>came knocking to toed up i decided that<br>that was the time<br>where i could um you know i could deal<br>with people's money i could process it<br>in the background<br>go the accountants i could deal with<br>people's investments i could<br>grow balance sheets all day every day<br>for many many<br>way across the mutu uh that was no<br>problem but i couldn't see the impact<br>that was having on our whanau<br>and so to go and work in new zealand's<br>government's arm that helped support<br>maori or exporters<br>uh that was a really big calling for me<br>because that was real<br>the other piece of that that was real<br>was that there was only two<br>maori exporters on the books at the time<br>that was not real so we needed to go in<br>and make change<br>because that was going to be where we<br>played we own the land<br>we own those assets that our that moana<br>those ekka<br>they belong to our people and so if we<br>weren't in control of where it was going<br>to land<br>well then it was obviously going to go<br>somewhere that might not have been at<br>the best interest of ourselves<br>carving that po keep on carving keep on<br>carving<br>it's a selfless task sometimes that you<br>have to do it<br>but it will give you the greatest<br>satisfaction when you do those things<br>right<br>on that journey i learnt other than<br>being at hatuhoypa in the sisterhood<br>other than being in cuckoo where i was<br>one of the few women actually of my age<br>i i built a different type of sisterhood<br>and it came out of stanford university<br>and that was our maori cohort of<br>business leaders that were there<br>so i want to acknowledge all of these<br>maori women<br>and call it out again just so that we<br>remember<br>so firstly my sister fiona wilson<br>just like to

values that was<br>the only way that they resolved that<br>fiona cassidy was at the heart of that<br>dr lily alice always we're very proud of<br>her<br>tadipoi higgins amazing every day<br>look at her look how beautiful this<br>wahine is i can say that just so she<br>won't ground me later<br>but but naitiripo i thank you from a<br>mama at hatohohipa<br>and through another mama that you've<br>been here today to the mama of aotearoa<br>tenacity fire and i'm going to call it<br>out professor harawanya higgins<br>she will hate me for saying that in the<br>sense that she's like ah get on with it<br>already but we must call it out<br>because what happened this year was<br>there was a moment where we had<br>one million people speaking through<br>maori<br>we can do this raunia you change the<br>world<br>your poe is looking pretty bloody<br>amazing i hope you can edit that for<br>that<br>gosh there are more we've got nanaya<br>mahuta first maori woman<br>at the ministry of foreign affairs and<br>trade georgina kingy<br>she molded all of us in some way shape<br>or form i think i've got the scars on my<br>legs to prove it<br>but that was what it took it took the<br>challenge so she is the principal of<br>hathaway<br>then we've got the james uh dame<br>georgina to<br>danger gina bayer you know for gender<br>diversity<br>it all started there imagine what they<br>had to go through<br>dame te atarangi kahu she inspires me to<br>no<br>end of what she had to go to dame nader<br>glavish<br>calling out kyoda taking the hit for it<br>and then look at it today so she's still<br>here and she is so proud<br>because one million maori speakers in<br>that moment in time<br>dame eva rickard not one more not one<br>more piece of land was ever going to be<br>taken under her watch<br>and of course the mother of all mothers<br>dame finna koopa<br>it is just amazing that we're here today<br>to do all of that<br>the things that you've experienced in<br>your lifetime are the stories<br>so not only has 2020 been a year of<br>disruption<br>as we've continued to carve our po<br>disruption to the world<br>let's just be really clear about that<br>it's disruption to the world<br>to my sister over here from brazil we've<br>got our staff who are up there at new<br>zealand training enterprise they've been<br>in lockdown<br>for nine months nine months i've been<br>working from home<br>so when we grumble have a little spare a<br>thought<br>for what else is happening out there we<br>are lucky<br>this is this is a great place outside of<br>new zealand it doesn't mean we have to<br>set us<br>you know just sit there and let those<br>things happen we've got to be better at<br>it<br>but we are lucky we are the lucky ones<br>what else happens this year in the<br>carvings of first well mukul<br>walk the halls of parliament that is<br>amazing<br>who would have ever thought that five<br>years ago<br>two years ago it's amazing stuff<br>um we all watched a heck of a lot of<br>netflix this year<br>right you know the ozarks last dance<br>who would have thought we would have all<br>watched the tiger king<br>oh my god that you know that changed<br>changed my will forever<br>i cannot get it out of my head if you<br>haven't watched it it's probably worth a<br>go<br>it's it's one of those things um<br>so just in wrapping up again just<br>remember the firsts<br>stuff you said sorry this year<br>well your sorry is actually not going to<br>be good enough let's just be really<br>clear about that<br>sorry doesn't change the hurt or the<br>mummy but<br>it is a sorry and it's a starting place<br>we can build with on that we can work<br>with that it's what you do next<br>and so that for you is a message for you<br>it's what you do next<br>how do you carve your po we've talked<br>about climate covered<br>climate change that guy donald trump<br>what's he about you know it's different<br>it's real and we've got to do things<br>differently we've got to work on<br>business<br>that makes a difference and so agencies<br>like mine have to start to think about<br>well should i really work with that<br>business that fertilizes everything on<br>the ground all that stuff leeches into<br>our others<br>that affects our tuna that goes on the<br>plate for my queer at the marae<br>should we be working with them no we<br>shouldn't we need to enforce<br>i'm going to call that one out anyway<br>even though it happened last year but<br>that happened<br>the pardoning of our people<br>doesn't take away the mama of the hurt<br>but it's the next step forward<br>maori party back someone's already<br>mentioned that in the in the<br>uh porphyry we had the rokawa agm this<br>is big deal this is big news<br>because we got our first maori woman<br>chair<br>and now many other we have done that<br>before but when you do those types of<br>catalytic changes<br>it makes a difference that's taken over<br>from a chair that's been there for 10<br>plus<br>years imagine what that energy would<br>look like now<br>don't be afraid of change don't let<br>other people's change<br>um and fear be the things that are<br>not that important for you<br>so when you're carving your po and<br>you're<br>thinking about the next steps think<br>about what impact you're<br>to make think about the<br>seven generations that are going to talk<br>about you after that<br>think about how you're going to be your<br>best ancestor be your best self<br>think about how you give it back how you<br>take a plus 1<br>10 20 on the waka with you<br>when you got those scholarships and you<br>deserve them<br>think about what you're going to<br>contribute to the things that are<br>important to you<br>think about those babies and what<br>where you don't want them to have to go<br>through the struggles that you have done<br>so<br>think about trying to get rid of<br>two-minute noodles because everyone's<br>eating far too many of them<br>for your university years but be your<br>best milder self<br>tomorrow be your best smartest self<br>today be your best smarter self<br>all that time and don't ever be ashamed<br>of it<br>it's got purpose it's got whakapapa and<br>it's got mana<br>and that is you when i look at you i'm<br>inspired<br>my po i can see what it's going to look<br>like after crossing paths with you all<br>and i can't help but want to share this<br>last piece<br>and before they cut the michael because<br>somebody's probably flashing a big light<br>at me<br>but if you give me one second i'll find<br>it<br>more importantly as a mum<br>i wanted to write this for my my<br>children oh i took a lot of photos so<br>i'm having to scroll through them it's<br>come up quite fast<br>technology error user error<br>one second oh i might have to flag it<br>because i can't get there fast enough<br>anyway<br>way too many photos today<br>oh goodness me i cannot find it i<br>thought it's not meant to occur today<br>but um i just want to shout this out<br>to you to all of you when you wear these<br>kodawai<br>whether they're on the outside or the<br>inside when you wear those tonga<br>that have been bequeathed and gifted<br>upon you wear them with pride<br>wear your degrees with pride you now<br>start your real-life education<br>don't be in a hurry take time<br>breathe celebrate look at each other<br>because as i recounted all those names<br>that i said and who i'm proud of and all<br>those women<br>it happened here you are<br>each other's futures so enjoy on that<br>tena koto<br>we<br>and just in my final departures they<br>make their way back to the seats<br>this has been the greatest privilege<br>like i said before<br>this time next week i jump on a plane<br>with my whanau<br>we head up to taiwan to take up the<br>first maori woman posted to taiwan's<br>trade commission of new zealand<br>so thank you yakurangatira i'm so<br>privileged<br>i'm so happy i came what a great way to<br>end<br>my time here in alternate new zealand<br>with you<br>kioda<br>tenacina<br>it is a tradition at this university<br>that the last of the formal speeches<br>the address given on behalf of all the<br>graduates is delivered by a student who<br>stood out in their time at the hedena<br>waka<br>by exemplifying the qualities we seek to<br>instill in our graduates<br>today's address will be given by eru<br>kappa kingi<br>has completed a bachelor of laws with<br>honours and the bachelor of arts and is<br>mentioned in his bio<br>has been working at the auckland high<br>okay<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>i want to acknowledge with great vigor<br>the whanau constituents here today<br>it seems a cliche and perhaps even goes<br>without saying<br>that without you these colleagues of<br>mine<br>i also want to make clear that i'm not<br>here today<br>to acknowledge mine or the achievements<br>of my fellow graduates here<br>my task here today is instead to<br>challenge them and myself<br>to use our new positions of privilege<br>and power<br>okay i recite some of the stirring words<br>of taluki kowitsi<br>which he shared with his family before<br>he passed<br>i battled against the god of the night a<br>metaphor which he used for pakia<br>colonial power<br>yet i did not perish so<br>i urge you to tread the path of war<br>those words are as relevant now as they<br>were<br>when kawati first uttered them over a<br>hundred years ago<br>he made his remarks because he predicted<br>a change to the world<br>he and his people knew was upon them<br>and he therefore carved out those words<br>to incite courage<br>change as we know can be a<br>fear-provoking prospect<br>and the world around us is indeed<br>changing<br>but it is up to us how we respond to<br>such change<br>the latest global pandemic has been<br>perhaps one of the most pertinent<br>indicators<br>of that change shining a light on<br>inequity<br>and the desperate need to revamp the<br>slanted system around us<br>but also shining a positive light on the<br>unwavering resilience<br>of maori when it comes to anything that<br>we have also seen positive indications<br>of change<br>teleol maori has become somewhat cool<br>thousands thousands maori and non-maori<br>alike<br>have marched and protested over the<br>theft and retention of fenugreek by the<br>crown<br>and the maori population is growing in<br>change is inevitable<br>and revolution is almost certain<br>but what that change and revolution<br>looks like and what may come of it<br>is up to us all of us here today<br>are the only ones in the way of our own<br>liberation<br>just as we are the only ones who will<br>lead the way<br>so my question to us all my will to us<br>all<br>and the great battle for mother maori<br>endured by our past lives<br>which we now confront will we run for<br>the hills<br>or will we do as our tupuna did and<br>continue to fight<br>into the carved trenches of whenua<br>i announce here today that we must be<br>prepared because the revolution is<br>coming in wars among us<br>the weapons with which we will fight are<br>not guns or tayaha<br>but the written and spoken word the<br>ammunition which will<br>which will sustain the battle will<br>instead be our passion<br>intellect and absolute self-belief<br>the field upon which we will battle as<br>vast and wide<br>and surround us infinitely the land and<br>the sky<br>are enclosed by its reach and the flag<br>which flies<br>is that of our maori<br>so i urge us<br>to march on into the future that awaits<br>us without fear nor quarter<br>and with confidence in our great maori<br>selves<br>so<br>um<br>foreign<br>oh<br>foreign<br>hey<br>today you have celebrated as graduates<br>of terena<br>sorry<br>thank you um congratulations on
