the mighty graduation this morning<br>and it was a privilege of mine also to<br>be standing here because i had a lot of<br>whanau unbeknown to me who<br>who and the foreign<br>it was full today was another flashback<br>in time<br>as i saw my university buddies bringing<br>their tamariki<br>up here you all of you today so it's<br>been an amazing weaving of achievement<br>through carving my po which is about to<br>carve your po<br>that's the thing i'd like to talk to you<br>about today how do you<br>carve and continue to carve your potoka<br>manual<br>your po here your po that's going to<br>guide you through life<br>i don't take too long because i stand<br>probably between you<br>and some other beverages somewhere else<br>along the ways uh you know i know i know<br>how that goes i know how that goes<br>um i think jason fox and the fox whanau<br>and cyrodiil and victor goldsmith and<br>all those others that i can see amidst<br>you all we spent many a time<br>having great discussions that's where<br>the real leading takes place<br>as was called the dungeon i'm not too<br>sure what your one is called<br>they have for all of you and the<br>guidance and the care<br>it's been it's been wonderful to<br>experience<br>um<br>already anyway but this is about you<br>this is about your next steps and what<br>you do<br>in the next minute what you do in the<br>next hour<br>and what you do tomorrow and where<br>that's going to make a greater impact<br>in life all of the stories that you have<br>uh<br>shared with us today all of the karawa<br>and queer<br>and whanau and mums and dads that have<br>passed before us<br>those giants whose shoulders you stand<br>on<br>they are going to be watching and help<br>guide you and poi pour you<br>no matter where you take your journey<br>don't be too hard on yourselves<br>gradually<br>when you start your new jobs some of you<br>already working some of you are mamas<br>i salute you some of you are working<br>papas i salute you<br>uh it's a tough road out there and<br>you've got time you know<br>we've been here for a little while maori<br>we think in waves of seven<br>so that's our generational story uh take<br>your time<br>enjoy your success and make sure that<br>you<br>you play a little bit you learn what<br>suits you and what makes your groove and<br>what gets you up in the morning<br>because there's nothing worse than doing<br>something that you're not passionate<br>about<br>my journey started my post started to be<br>carved in the center of my universe<br>cuckoo<br>uh it's about an hour hour 15 minutes uh<br>north of here<br>and i grew up on the muddai i was a<br>village kid like many of all of you<br>and we all had other mums we all had<br>other phenomena from other maunga were<br>your hair or dads some sometimes you<br>didn't even know who they were<br>but that was us we were tight and you<br>always had your cousins on your back or<br>on your wings<br>uh that was the most amazing thing so<br>from cuckoo from we didn't have<br>kohangaroo at the time we had play<br>center at the muddai<br>and so i was a protege of that i went<br>over to over the river<br>to oho school you've all got your ohio<br>schools type stories<br>it's where you have your first encounter<br>outside your village often<br>so in the park your kids look at you<br>because you're a fear maori and say oh<br>you're not mighty enough<br>it's where you start to carve your first<br>mook or stripe for yourself<br>and identify what that means for you<br>those are the battlegrounds and that's<br>when your big cousins come in and they<br>kind of give that kind of hide in any<br>way but anyway<br>i can't do that anymore we'll just have<br>a nice corridor<br>and i went on to hatohoeba<br>that is why i'm here just so we're clear<br>when<br>my sister maito hine from hatohohipa<br>rings up and says can you come there is<br>only one answer you give<br>yes i i'll be there whenever you need it<br>we will turn up but if we've got<br>something better to share with you<br>that's even better so um luckily i've<br>got a little bit of something that might<br>help inspire you<br>because you inspire me um<br>hato hopa south america off i went on my<br>first<br>exploration around the world i thought<br>going out of cuckoo to ohio was a big<br>step forward now i'm in argentina and<br>that kind of gave me a different<br>appreciation of what the world looked<br>like<br>i was then told after 18 months i was<br>only supposed to be there for 12.<br>get back on the plane or ask your<br>cousins to come to get you those same<br>ones that were looking after me back in<br>cuckoo<br>and so i came and i came here<br>so when you walked up that ara naminami<br>right there it took me back it took me<br>back to the time that i heard<br>tiripurakigans<br>do the karanga to us when we joined<br>tihirangawaka<br>it took me back to when i saw pau temura<br>dances<br>across this maho welcoming me and my<br>cohort and my colleagues into this<br>university<br>it is a wonderful wonderful thing<br>whakapapa<br>relationships that's what will take you<br>forward<br>don't ever forget those that help you<br>and i don't think you will listening to<br>the corridor that you said<br>uh who who come with you who you do this<br>for it's impact that you make the most<br>inspiring thing i've seen today<br>is when these little mukapuna get up to<br>haka to you<br>you could be their mums you could be the<br>big brothers or sisters or aunties<br>but they are doing this for you because<br>they can be what they see and they<br>see you it's amazing it's an amazing<br>amazing thing and we must do this<br>those of you that are the first in your<br>whanau to come to the fariwan and come<br>to university<br>they see you i salute you<br>it's an amazing thing uh<br>it's okay we're still covering our po<br>right so there's a whole lot of carving<br>going on because life takes you on many<br>many journeys and sometimes<br>you go wrong so you just get a bigger<br>chisel and you reshape it you recover<br>and you restructure and you reset<br>you might just put a beautiful piece of<br>panamu or beautiful powershell in there<br>that'll remind you of the tanifa<br>that are out there in the world amidst<br>us what a year<br>it's been a tiny far of a year 2020<br>but this morning we had whanau join us<br>and they were from brazil<br>and they were from india and other<br>places of the world and they chose to be<br>here with us our people are wonderful<br>our fakado maori our mata rangamati is<br>wonderful<br>and it's so embracing and so encouraging<br>just when we think life's tough here<br>i've got work colleagues<br>because i'm from new zealand trade and<br>enterprise on my day job<br>that's what i get paid for there's a<br>whole lot of other jobs that go on<br>around there like everybody else<br>and i've got work colleagues and brazil<br>no less have been<br>inside their fare for nine months so<br>when we have a grumble<br>let's just take a bigger perspective and<br>think about<br>how lucky and privileged we are back<br>here it might feel<br>tough and it is tough so not to diminish<br>what that has meant for everybody<br>but it's not happening just to you it's<br>happening to the world<br>i wanted to share with you a few firsts<br>because uh as my<br>tanganyi over here said in his corridor<br>this morning<br>um so i wanted to that was actually the<br>theme of my corduroy<br>as well there are so many firsts that<br>should be acknowledged<br>and we need to keep talking about them<br>because if we don't they get forgotten<br>and we've already learned what happens<br>when we don't talk about our corridor<br>they go silent so some of the firsts<br>that i wanted to shout out today were<br>stuff cured stuff thank you for your<br>apology<br>thank you it's not good enough it will<br>be important to see what you do next<br>but we know it we're not the crazy ones<br>all those things are being crafted on<br>our behalf<br>so that's an amazing acknowledgement to<br>say that that occurred<br>aside from covert and living through<br>this world<br>pandemic your nannies might talk about<br>the spanish flu<br>it still wasn't in their lifetime you<br>are living through something that nobody<br>else<br>you know prior to us has lived through<br>before<br>um some of the other things where i<br>wanted to call out some of the wahine<br>that are around and doing great things<br>because they are the inspiration that we<br>take with us<br>the first uh has been

maori woman appointed<br>into a senior position<br>at the reserve bank of new zealand she<br>is the deputy governor of the reserve<br>bank of new zealand<br>you can be what you can see and there<br>are many that are out there<br>kiritana another hato haha girl partner<br>has been one of my fellow colleagues at<br>mahi but she's gone out there<br>and with many others has helped

berries<br>that are growing there<br>it's going to be an amazing business<br>journey from one orchard three years ago<br>to nine orchards being done now it takes<br>time and it takes courage and passion<br>she is the chair of phi maya from ngati<br>fatiha kiwaraki<br>another one at the helm she pre preceded<br>me<br>as the co-chair of tuputua maori and<br>pacifica internship program which i now<br>cheer after her but hers is about social<br>impact<br>so all of these other things this is<br>where you guys come into this this is<br>where i'm<br>going to come in because of what you<br>study it's not about the money<br>it's about what footprints we leave and<br>about how great our 2.0 you're going to<br>be<br>so every decision you make now is going<br>to have significant impact on those that<br>follow behind you<br>hey trump there's mr trump we know what<br>that looks like as well<br>um megan tapsell there's some tapsil<br>whanau here<br>really important to know megan heads up<br>the

army<br>i don't know if you've ever seen the<br>movie soldier without guns for the<br>bougainville story<br>was she led that charge taken in new<br>zealand's army<br>and that was our culture it was our ways<br>it was without violence<br>that actually stopped that friction for<br>those people that were out for knowing<br>that<br>it is here of course<br>and i want to point out this amazing<br>wahine over here terepo<br>higgins who i met first when i was at<br>she may not even know it but just the<br>impact that she has made the class<br>the stature the brains she growled

speakers<br>it can be done everybody and so when you<br>think about what you do next as you<br>carve your po<br>when you consider apologies from staff<br>when you consider covered<br>when you consider climate change because<br>it is so real and it will<br>hopefully won't impact us at all as much<br>but it's going to impact us<br>nonetheless and we've got the tools<br>mataranga maori has the tools<br>to actually fight against those things<br>whilst it wasn't this year is so<br>important to make sure that we we<br>consider all of those things<br>these are our people starting to be<br>acknowledged for the things that they've<br>done<br>that wasn't it not at their own hands<br>maori party's back in<br>parliament<br>which means that moko kawai and mataura<br>walk the halls of parliament it's<br>another phenomenal first<br>and i love to see our wahine with their<br>mokokowai<br>their their marks that they wear on the<br>outside just to remind people<br>that we are here it is phenomenal<br>i was going to raise i call agm it's a<br>very significant thing when we got our<br>first wahine chair after 10 years<br>um but the other key things there are<br>some amazing<br>bigger people that we stand on the<br>shoulders of our wonderful dames<br>our wonderful serves you know they our<br>tars<br>and our marek they are amazing so keep<br>reminding

be<br>standing before you<br>as your graduate speaker for this<br>graduation celebration<br>today i graduate with a bachelor of arts<br>majoring in pacific studies and maori<br>resource management<br>i started here at tehengawaka in 2017.<br>and the past four years have been a trip<br>of a lifetime<br>an incredible journey of highs and lows<br>savage storms and profound calms<br>frustration determination for overall<br>growth<br>i technically finished studying last<br>year and the smooth sailing i was told<br>about post-uni life<br>has not eventuated with the coronavirus<br>shaking our entire global society i want<br>to acknowledge<br>all the loss and her endured across the<br>world<br>i salute each and every one of us for<br>dealing with the frustration and<br>confusion that came with such an<br>unfamiliar experience the world is<br>ever-changing<br>and adapting to these new realities is<br>one of the many storms we'll sail<br>through<br>in life when thinking of where i am<br>today<br>and what my university journey has meant<br>to me i can only make sense of it in a<br>world i know best<br>that is the world of waka as well as the<br>many doors this university opened up for<br>me<br>i'm privileged and proud to say i am a<br>komwana onboard te matou<br>maui wakahodua or crew member on board<br>the double-hulled sailing canoe of<br>ngatikahunganu<br>the life on board teaches you so much<br>about teamwork<br>commitment reading the signs of your<br>environment but most importantly<br>how you really are the captain of your<br>own canoe<br>i see life as a great expansive ocean<br>and we are like waka channeling through<br>that water<br>with the many storms that surround us<br>we can sail on through and are<br>eventually blessed by tamanui<br>coming to university is like training<br>your waka in the lagoon<br>getting the lessons the tools and the<br>overall experience needed<br>to head out into the deep blue moana<br>the two hulls of o wakahodua can be<br>interpreted in many different ways<br>they can represent the two worlds of tau<br>maori or the western way of life<br>the balance between friends and family<br>and your life back home<br>found verse your new found realities<br>either way a waka cannot truly operate<br>without the balance and it all comes<br>down to the skills<br>and foundations we allow ourselves to<br>use<br>i couldn't be more grateful for the many<br>stored provisions i'm blessed with<br>from the love and support of my<br>beautiful whanau my friends both back<br>home<br>and sitting here in front of me and all<br>the many interactions i have had in<br>preparation for today's celebration<br>the kaupapa or deck of the waka is a<br>space where everyone is able to come<br>together<br>it's the platforms the mixing and<br>mingling and the opportunity in life<br>every person is given kotahitanga is<br>vital to the collective success of tewi<br>maori<br>and the needed space to communicate<br>sorry<br>and the communication needed to work<br>together would not happen without these<br>spaces<br>for me there were many different wahi<br>that acted as my copa by here at tahiti<br>was definitely a platform i could not<br>have got through university without<br>from the many amazing feasts i was able<br>to enjoy<br>to the stories in whakapapa shared over<br>a good cup of tea<br>i was able to share space with now to<br>the function of the sails<br>these represent your preparedness for<br>the many influential winds that come and<br>go<br>in each of our lives these ones are the<br>people<br>the places the lessons and all the<br>adventures that come from<br>each direction your sales are powered by<br>what you surround yourself with<br>and however they are set can take you to<br>amazingly different places<br>like the randomest midnight missions to<br>oriental parade<br>last but definitely not least the<br>steering paddle<br>or hoy is what determines your direction<br>i came to university to gain a restingly<br>wicked<br>a westernly recognized tohu to bring an<br>indigenous voice and story to the table<br>i stayed because of my continued passion<br>to positively represent<br>my whanau maihapuri and tiwi maori<br>and now it's about steering al waka into<br>what looks like very exciting<br>and intriguing waters any waka is<br>capable of getting onto the lagoon<br>it's making it out to te moana nui that<br>waka were really made for<br>we need to trust in the process and have<br>faith in the matodanga of our tipuna<br>society teaches us that only the smart<br>and rich can make it to university<br>but if there is one thing i want you to<br>take away from this corridor<br>it's that everyone is capable and in<br>control of their own waka<br>and not even a low grade at university<br>can stop us from making it to today's<br>celebration<br>maybe you need some time on land to<br>mentally prepare yourselves for the<br>challenges<br>and adventures that will take place once<br>you have left<br>or maybe just spending time with your<br>whanau is all you need<br>to fill your provision provisionary kete<br>for the voyage<br>ahead we are all smart and rich in our<br>own ways<br>and the university is only one of the<br>many destinations<br>that life's journey will take us on<br>remember where you come from and we want<br>to go<br>but be prepared for waves to roll up<br>along the way<br>we all tied our waka to the hitch post<br>of this marae<br>and it is now time to untie that hede to<br>pull in your toda<br>we are all capable we are all strong and<br>we have all<br>waka<br>anyway<br>m<br>foreign<br>oh<br>my<br>oh<br>is<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>oh<br>oh<br>thank you congratulations on your<br>achievements
