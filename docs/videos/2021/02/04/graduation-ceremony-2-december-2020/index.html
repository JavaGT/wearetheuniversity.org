people you might be<br>thinking that i took a long time<br>acknowledging people<br>that's very true and it was very<br>deliberate<br>without those people and without very<br>many others<br>i wouldn't be standing here today<br>graduates when when i sat<br>we use it today i probably thought about<br>becoming a chartered accountant<br>travel and maybe the next party<br>and on reflection it was probably in the<br>other order<br>now as at the other end of my career<br>i think about the people that i worked<br>for<br>the people i worked with those who<br>supported me and those that didn't<br>those that were there in bad times<br>those who celebrated the joyful times<br>those that did good those who didn't<br>those rich networks of people<br>in new zealand across and across the<br>world<br>are vital to the service i've been able<br>to give our country<br>and the opportunities i've had globally<br>graduates as you enter the workforce<br>continue in your careers or

is awarded to someone who<br>during their time at our university<br>has exemplified the qualities that we<br>seek to instill<br>in all our graduates<br>this evening's address will be given by<br>fraser tate<br>who has graduated with a bachelor of<br>tourism management<br>majoring in tourism management<br>fraser studied both part-time and<br>full-time<br>over four years balancing his studies<br>while working as a ski instructor on<br>mount ruapehu<br>and as a restaurant duty manager<br>he was a tutor for three years for first<br>and second year tourism courses and<br>presented a briefing paper<br>outlining various strategic directions<br>within tourism<br>in new zealand to the then minister of<br>tourism<br>calvin davis fraser is currently working<br>as the assistant brand experience<br>manager<br>for villa maria in the hawke bay<br>he is passionate about showcasing the<br>country's beauty<br>and hopes to continue to work to further<br>improve<br>new zealand's tourism industry ladies<br>and gentlemen<br>please welcome fraser tate to give the<br>good evening it is a great pleasure that<br>i have been given the opportunity<br>to speak this evening on behalf of this<br>year's graduates<br>this setting is slightly more<br>intimidating but i am very grateful to<br>be delivering the speech to you in<br>person<br>this ceremony acknowledges the hard work<br>and commitment of tonight's graduates<br>however we could not have reached this<br>achievement on our own<br>thank you to all in attendance tonight<br>each of you<br>have had a role to play in helping me<br>and my fellow students<br>walk across the stage tonight<br>parents guardians family<br>and my own biggest supporters mum and<br>dad<br>thank you for the care packages your<br>unwavering encouragement<br>assistance and love one of the first<br>things<br>university taught me was how little<br>attention i had paid to the intricacies<br>of daily living for my first 18 years<br>so thank you for fielding the array of<br>how to adult questions<br>to friends i know for a fact that i<br>wouldn't<br>be where i am tonight without the social<br>circles i have developed<br>and i imagine this ring is true for all<br>graduates<br>the value of being able to call on you<br>when needed is immediate<br>the sunday morning flat discussions<br>about who did what the night prior<br>all the heated debates about the<br>important things in life<br>like whether eggs need to be kept on or<br>out of the fridge<br>are some of the things i love most about<br>being constantly surrounded<br>with like-minded students so thank you<br>to the school of business and government<br>your knowledge<br>and passion has been enthralling the<br>diversity across the staff<br>made for a true melting pot of stories<br>and experiences<br>that brought a wealth of viewpoints to<br>light<br>to have access to such a high caliber of<br>professors and lecturers<br>and this little corner of the world is<br>something i am truly grateful for<br>i'd like to make a special thank you to<br>the small team of staff from the tourism<br>management department<br>to have the ability to speak with you<br>one-on-one so frequently<br>have doors open for me and my career<br>while also working under you as a tutor<br>for three years<br>is something i have greatly appreciated<br>i can attribute a lot of my drive and<br>passion<br>to contribute to the industry to you<br>and now it's my fellow graduates just as<br>when we arrived at university<br>and were faced with the task of starting<br>to become adults<br>now as we leave and take on the<br>workplace this task is magnified tenfold<br>what a year it has been we are now<br>walking into a world<br>drastically different from the one we<br>had at the beginning of our journey<br>through university life<br>however if this year has taught me<br>anything it is to be more grateful<br>and while the pandemic has brought about<br>huge tragedies to the world<br>i am grateful to have a bit of new<br>material to cover in this year's<br>the amount of times i've heard the word<br>normal recently has grown dramatically<br>so many people saying they can't wait<br>for things to go back to normal<br>in june when i finished my final exam<br>said farewell to flatmates<br>and staff i couldn't help but look at<br>the situation with a little despair<br>the borders were closed plans flouted<br>industries come crumbling and me sitting<br>there with the tourism management degree<br>while the most distance anyone was<br>allowed to travel<br>that moment in june was meant to be one<br>of excitement<br>and celebration and instead as i imagine<br>it were<br>for many graduates was replaced with<br>apprehension<br>and concern to go back to the old normal<br>then would have been great<br>since that time my viewpoint has changed<br>considerably<br>while the current situation is far from<br>ideal the old normal wasn't without its<br>troubles too<br>i now see this as a bit of a reset<br>button<br>much like an earthquake has the ability<br>to flatten the city<br>the virus has had a vast effect on all<br>facets of life<br>however when the dust settles cities are<br>rebuilt<br>new ways of thinking are needed and the<br>people's action these plans<br>are given freedom to create a better way<br>of living<br>the canvas not entirely blank but the<br>opportunities that we now have as<br>graduates<br>with thanks to those surrounding us this<br>finally one of my favorite books is<br>titled<br>every time i find the meaning of life<br>they change it<br>while it may currently seem as though<br>the rug has been pulled from underneath<br>us<br>just as plans have been made challenges<br>will continue to be thrown at us<br>throughout our lives and we will have to<br>adapt<br>a continual search for improvement<br>while some things i could do without<br>normalizing<br>like flatmates taking zoom calls at the<br>dining room table and a boxer short<br>slash certain thai ensemble<br>with the title of that book in mind and<br>the acknowledgement<br>that the world is an ever-changing<br>environment<br>my challenge to you is to take the<br>skills you have learnt here<br>take the social networks you have built<br>and go create<br>a new better normal i look forward to<br>fraser thank you congratulations on your<br>achievement<br>and thank you for your message of hope<br>and opportunity<br>in the sector in which you hope to work<br>in a tourism is certainly one<br>in which we need to certainly look ahead<br>with in a new way an exciting way thank<br>you<br>this evening has been a celebration of<br>your achievements<br>and a formal acknowledgement of your<br>admission<br>to the community of scholars at this<br>university<br>before i wrap up i'd like to ask you all<br>to join me in thanking three<br>special groups of people without whom<br>this evening ceremony<br>would not have occurred
