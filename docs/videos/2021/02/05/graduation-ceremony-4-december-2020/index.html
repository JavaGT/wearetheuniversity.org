that i<br>invite our honorary doctorate<br>chris finlayson to give today's<br>chancellor vice chancellor<br>rhodanguetirama<br>it's a great pleasure to be here today<br>but i first want to begin<br>by acknowledging you the graduates<br>congratulations<br>on what you have achieved and all the<br>very very best for the future<br>i particularly want to acknowledge<br>my friend and colleague from bankside<br>chambers simon foote<br>who has just graduated with a doctor of<br>philosophy degree<br>this is not an advertisement but he's a<br>very fine lawyer<br>a great colleague and i didn't know that<br>he was so studious<br>can i also acknowledge my former youth<br>mp<br>sam hart sam and his family are very<br>dear friends of mine<br>his mother deb is moving his admission<br>to the bar<br>on friday and he is as nervous as i am<br>that she's going to fluff her lines<br>there are other people<br>present whose names i think i recognize<br>i see a tremaine out there i think i<br>know you<br>congratulations on your achievement<br>my favorite story about honoree<br>doctorates<br>concerns the late robert muldoon<br>he was given an honorary doctorate i<br>don't know by what university many years<br>ago and he was asked in the house by<br>mike<br>moore whether he intended to use the<br>title<br>doctor part-time as in dr<br>the answer i understand was volcanic<br>but the correct answer is that someone<br>who receives an<br>honorary doctorate is not entitled to<br>use the name<br>doctor but it is received with great<br>pleasure<br>and with grateful thanks to the<br>university<br>i endorse everything that the chancellor<br>said<br>about how lucky we all are<br>to have been graduates of victoria<br>university<br>the governor general hates it when i say<br>this but she was my<br>torts tutor jeffrey palmer former prime<br>minister<br>terrorized me in legal system and the<br>law of torts<br>and ken keith who was finally a judge<br>of our supreme court and a judge of the<br>international court of justice<br>taught me administrative law and<br>international law<br>and it was such a great pleasure and<br>honor to<br>appear before him in the hague<br>when we took the japanese to the<br>international court of justice<br>over whaling in the southern oceans<br>but the particular person in the faculty<br>i want to acknowledge<br>is professor tony angelo tony angelo was<br>my first teacher he gave me 7 out of 30<br>for my first terms test and legal system<br>and he wrote over my paper confused<br>about the law<br>well eat that tony because i was<br>attorney general for nine years<br>but<br>but he was an outstanding servant of the<br>faculty<br>for half a century he was dean of the<br>law faculty during a very tough time for<br>the faculty<br>when a report was written by it that<br>broke all the rules of natural<br>justice and he had to pick up the pieces<br>and do a great job he did<br>he's worked extensively throughout the<br>pacific<br>and in mauritius designing the laws of<br>mauritius<br>and for that reason he was made a<br>queen's council<br>by me in 2016 and<br>was given the honour of the order of the<br>new zealand<br>order of merit he's an outstanding<br>individual<br>and he typifies the commitment and the<br>excellence of the law faculty<br>when i studied constitutional law<br>with professor quentin baxter<br>i have to say that we never once<br>studied the treaty of waitangi it never<br>rated a mansion and yet most of the work<br>that i did in my public life<br>concerned the treaty of waitangi and<br>breaches of it<br>and it very much was the education of a<br>public man<br>to be the minister for treaty of<br>waitangi negotiations<br>and try and address some of the wrongs<br>that have occurred<br>in our nation's history and i<br>particularly<br>think for example of takings under the<br>public works act<br>because i can tell you this if ever<br>there was land to be taken for a road<br>and the choice was between taking<br>general land<br>or maori land guess what land was taken<br>inevitably i was honored to stand at<br>parihaka and apologize<br>for the atrocious events that occurred<br>there<br>i was so lucky to be the minister when<br>we apologize<br>to the great naituhoy and i acknowledge<br>professor rawinia higgins here today<br>so many wrongs will have been<br>perpetrated<br>throughout history against those<br>wonderful people<br>most recently with the horrendous police<br>raid in ruatoki some 10<br>12 years ago they have been treated so<br>unfairly<br>and to reach a settlement with them and<br>to apologize<br>for what happened was one of the great<br>highlights of my career<br>i acknowledge damn fran wilde who's here<br>today<br>she is among other things the chair of<br>te papa<br>she was my treaty negotiator<br>on many occasions and i always remember<br>the time fran phoned me<br>and said look the ewe i think it was<br>ngati pajawera<br>want some land and doc says it's<br>pristine land<br>but there's only one problem with it<br>it's covered in ghosts and it's got<br>goats on it<br>it's old lands and survey land and i<br>said well i'll pay a visit<br>remarkably by the time i visited<br>the goats had been shot and the course<br>had been cleared<br>and that was ten days so this is the<br>sort of thing<br>that e we have had to confront year in<br>and year out<br>treaty settlement negotiations were<br>never easy<br>and in accepting uh the honorary<br>doctorate it's<br>so important for me to say i accept it<br>not only for myself<br>but for the many many people who have<br>worked so very hard<br>in treaty negotiations over the years to<br>secure justice for their people<br>so as you practice law and i'm obviously<br>not referring to the engineering<br>graduates<br>i do hope that the lawyers here today<br>will recognize<br>the opportunities that there are that<br>what you<br>may think you've you may think that you<br>have<br>learned it all but i can tell you your<br>education and the law<br>is only just beginning so thank you very<br>much for the tremendous honor<br>that i have been accorded today<br>i very much appreciate the opportunity<br>that i had to be the minister of treaty<br>negotiations<br>and i'm very heartened that in recent<br>times the dominion<br>post and other newspapers have decided<br>to apologize for their coverage<br>of treaty matters over the years as well<br>they should<br>when i was negotiating with ngati tua<br>over the great haka composed by<br>tarapraha<br>and secured an agreement over that with<br>ngati tua the headline in the dominion<br>post was<br>all blacks harker goes to maori so<br>they've got a long way to go<br>a lot to apologize for there are other<br>things i could suggest they apologize<br>for<br>but my political career is over so<br>what's done is done<br>chancellor vice chancellor members of<br>victoria

commerce<br>majoring in economics and finance<br>throughout his studies fletcher helped<br>other students<br>as a peer leader and as a tutor for both<br>law<br>and economics first year courses he has<br>been involved in the victoria business<br>consulting club<br>and was the president of the victoria<br>university of wellington<br>law student society in 2018<br>and the president of the new zealand law<br>students association<br>in 2019<br>fletcher is currently working at hamas<br>horton lusk<br>a specialist corporate law firm and sits<br>as a member of the council of legal<br>education<br>ladies and gentlemen please welcome<br>fletcher james boswell<br>to give the graduate address<br>good afternoon chancellor vice<br>chancellor<br>victoria university of wellington staff<br>whanau<br>friends and of course fellow graduates i<br>want to start by actually thanking the<br>graduation office for allowing this<br>event to go ahead in the first place<br>much like an 8 30 a.m lecture after<br>t-shirt night<br>i'm sure it would have been very<br>tempting after the second delayed<br>graduation<br>to opt for the recorded version to be<br>watched from the comfort of our own<br>bubbles or flats<br>but particularly after the year that has<br>been<br>there's something quite special after<br>being able to celebrate the last three<br>four five day i say six<br>six years together in the same room and<br>what a ride it's been<br>we've survived thousands of hours of<br>lectures tutorials<br>several earthquakes the my allocator<br>tutorial sign up debacle<br>a global pandemic and the best efforts<br>of our friends at krishna food to talk<br>us into veganism and yoga<br>if all those tossed together don't build<br>some sort of sense of camaraderie<br>i'm unsure what would but through all of<br>this<br>i remember being told when i started my<br>time at vic that uni is a team sport<br>it's not something you can do by<br>yourself and it's not designed to be<br>taken on that way either<br>and so it's very fitting that we sit<br>here today surrounded by that team<br>our family our friends our lecturers<br>tutors and so many others who have<br>helped us<br>supported us and stood by us through our<br>time at university<br>now the first part of that team that i<br>want to particularly acknowledge<br>are the lecturers and professional staff<br>it's hard to articulate how generous you<br>all are with your time<br>and how much you care about the students<br>of our uni<br>there are the university staff like<br>colin the papataya campus security guard<br>who'd walk around telling people the<br>library was closed and making sure they<br>got that downtime and as well<br>or our tireless administrators like<br>pauline castle<br>who regardless of how busy she was and<br>pauline was very busy<br>always made time to check in on students<br>who looked a little stressed out<br>and our lecturers like professor yvette<br>tinsley who encouraged us to go to the<br>district court<br>so we could see firsthand the effects of<br>new zealand's criminal justice system<br>or professor jeff mcclay who cared so<br>much about building a sense of community<br>at our law school<br>that he and his dog coco would turn up<br>every single friday morning at 7am<br>to run with those particularly eager<br>students but<br>never have i been so proud to be a<br>student at our university<br>than when in 2018 during a protest<br>against gendered violence and bullying<br>in the legal profession<br>our lecturers led by professor mark<br>hickford not only encouraged us to leave<br>class for this<br>but join their students in advocating<br>for a better<br>fairer legal profession the people here<br>today<br>behind me are more than just staff<br>members they're more than just employees<br>of this university they're role models<br>whose passion for their subjects is<br>rivaled only by their concern for the<br>university<br>so thank you to those family members and<br>friends here today<br>while the degrees we receive have our<br>names on them honestly the achievement<br>is just as much yours as it is ours<br>mum and dad i'm sure after having to put<br>up with years and years of unsolicited<br>hot takes on anything to do with law and<br>commerce<br>and often things that weren't as well<br>has no doubt tested your patience and<br>your decision to send me down to law<br>school<br>but also to all the loved ones here<br>today and to those who could not attend<br>as well<br>i'm sure i speak for all the graduates<br>when i say thank you so much for<br>everything that you have done for us<br>thank you for listening to stories about<br>200 level statistics or contract law<br>papers and responding with<br>thank you for the care packages and<br>thank you for pretending that our<br>complaints of self-inflicted<br>all-nighters to get<br>that assignment in came anything close<br>to the trials and tribulations you faced<br>in raising us<br>in the first place now at the risk of<br>sounding like a philosophy student or a<br>first year tutorial ice breaker<br>i think it's worth reflecting briefly on<br>what comes next for us as graduates<br>we've left university at a very strange<br>time and the world is looking like a<br>very different place<br>to even when some of us finished that<br>last exam or handed in that last<br>assignment<br>but despite this change it's hard not to<br>be excited about what comes next<br>it's hard not to be excited when<br>although we're dispersing into different<br>careers<br>cities or causes or indeed already have<br>we've already seen that our cohort is<br>one that wants to and in fact can<br>make a difference in these areas that we<br>choose<br>it's hard not to be excited when even if<br>tertiary education is unfortunately<br>still such a privilege in new zealand<br>each graduation cohort including our own<br>looks more and more like atero new<br>zealand<br>it's hard not to be excited when<br>although our society and even the world<br>at large is currently being gripped by<br>some major health<br>economic and social challenges we've<br>just received a world-class education<br>from a very cool little capital city<br>with some very uncool weather giving us<br>the foundation to take on these<br>challenges<br>look new zealand is not a country that<br>is renowned for gushing over milestones<br>and kiwis love to play down an<br>achievement but the achievement of<br>graduating today<br>is one worth celebrating and it's one<br>worth celebrating with the people that<br>we love the most<br>so thank you everyone for being part of<br>the last six years<br>congratulations on what you've achieved<br>and good luck for the next chapter<br>you<br>thank you very much fletcher and i think<br>you've are a fine example of someone<br>who's<br>make taken the most of their<br>opportunities at university and we wish<br>you all the very best and what i'm sure<br>will be a very bright future<br>this afternoon has been a celebration of<br>your achievements and as a formal<br>acknowledgement of your admittance to<br>the community of scholars<br>at this university before i<br>wrap things up i'd like to ask you all<br>here to join me in thanking three<br>special groups of people without whom<br>this celebration the ceremony would not<br>proceed firstly<br>could you join me in thanking our<br>musicians in kappa haka group<br>for adding to the color and vibrancy of<br>these occasions are special because they<br>are so well organized they're

all<br>of you<br>will you please join me in thanking our<br>wonderful volunteers<br>and uh as fletcher has said you wouldn't<br>uh<br>in all likelihood be here without the<br>wonderful staff of the university our<br>professional staff and our academic<br>staff<br>like to acknowledge their patience their<br>diligence their support of you<br>and their sheer dedication to teaching<br>and in helping our graduates get to<br>where you all are<br>today and can i also take this<br>opportunity<br>here to acknowledge how hard they've all<br>had to work<br>this year delivering teaching through<br>lockdowns<br>delivering dual mode of in-class and<br>online lectures and so on<br>whilst maintaining research excellence<br>and<br>commitment to everybody has been a<br>a fantastic effort
