next we're going to hear from two of<br>our team who've<br>helped expand our portfolio of research<br>even further<br>we're going to hear from associate<br>professor chris pemberton who heads the<br>translational biodiscovery lab<br>who's going to tell us about setting up<br>a commercial venture<br>and dr alemanda fartus far easy<br>sorry amanda will describe our research<br>looking at heart disease risk factors in<br>maori and pacific<br>um thanks vicky so this is the a bit of<br>a tale of upstream medical technologies<br>um a tale of year oldie biotech upstart<br>that's actually a photo of the top end<br>of the the wyman river<br>upstream and when we set this up<br>one thing that because i was intimately<br>involved with it one thing that i<br>demanded was naming rights<br>and upstream was the choice because a i<br>like fishing and you go upstream to get<br>the best fish<br>and it has all these connotations this<br>stuff matters<br>with the establishment of this<br>everything that you've heard about<br>before particularly in the essay lab<br>none of this was possible without the<br>efforts of gary<br>and mark and eric and particularly<br>tongue<br>and i'm going to share a very small<br>anecdote about tim<br>when i first turned up here as a phd<br>student i was very fortunate to have<br>eric as my supervisor<br>and i went to the very first meeting and<br>it was in the riverside second floor and<br>the winter sun was streaming in<br>and there anyone who's dealt with eric<br>was off and he was talking about the<br>whole<br>situation and i sat there and i thought<br>my god what have i got myself into i<br>can't keep up<br>you know there's no way and tim was in<br>the corner<br>and i thought this is it you know my<br>head's going to explode i'm done<br>and tim just very quietly said no eric<br>and said something and eric stopped and<br>i thought<br>i'm going to pay attention to this man<br>he has the power<br>and it's been like that ever since he's<br>really established a world leading lab<br>he<br>is courted by diagnostic companies they<br>take his opinion very seriously<br>everything i'm going to talk about here<br>is not possible without the efforts of<br>him in the lab that he'd created around<br>him<br>so we had we had good intentions at the<br>start um<br>so in cardiovascular disease as you've<br>heard about um<br>clinicians now have great markers bnp is<br>the marker for heart failure<br>um but also troponin for heart attacks<br>so if you're having an acute event<br>like that where there's kind of a it's<br>very serious<br>they will serve with that what they<br>don't have is a marker for<br>where the heart is insulted by ischemia<br>or some other thing<br>it doesn't result in terminal death like<br>myocardial infarction or a heart attack<br>where troponin is released from the<br>heart<br>and it's you don't have the the changes<br>in<br>ventricular wall stress that eric talked<br>about before<br>but it's a very serious thing it's an<br>extremely important precursor if you<br>have an event like unstable angina<br>the risk of you having a heart attack<br>within a year<br>is just the same as someone who's had a<br>heart attack at the index that evidence<br>is now starting to emerge so there needs<br>to be<br>marker improvements to help guide the<br>clinicians and give them a better heads<br>up<br>for two reasons one that you've had an<br>ischemic event and two outcomes what are<br>they going to do about it<br>so we set off with good intentions to<br>address this situation to um<br>decrease the crowding in congested ers<br>and also help with<br>provocative tests such as stress testing<br>and an idea was born<br>and in the late 2000s we published a<br>number of papers<br>because of the interdigitation and<br>collaboration within the group on signal<br>peptides<br>and this this got a bit of an impact um<br>it was published in the topia in journal<br>time circulation and got an editorial<br>recognition and we published a few more<br>papers after that<br>and we went and spoke with the wonderful<br>chaps at otago innovation<br>um and in the board and i have to<br>acknowledge harleen here<br>you're still on the board yeah and<br>you're very supportive and without your<br>support and encouragement none of this<br>could have happened<br>and we were met with a rather<br>enthusiastic david christensen who<br>turned up and true harry potter like<br>status and said why don't we set up a<br>company<br>looking to the stars and i replied in<br>the usual vernacular that's bloody<br>brilliant let's do it<br>um so that was established in uh 2015.<br>then a very novel experience occurred so<br>we set our about to do the things we<br>were supposed to do<br>with the company with logistics and<br>reagents and doing the work<br>and we could partner with the university<br>of otago and the chi<br>as well so it gave us another string to<br>our bow<br>and that people who invested in the<br>company and the lead investors we could<br>then<br>subcontract to the chi and give us<br>another revenue for getting work done<br>that might not<br>always get done but then the lead<br>investor in 2016<br>2017 appeared in disappeareth<br>we came under the powerhouse ventures<br>stable and that changed in 2019<br>um this was a novel experience usually<br>it's the researchers who run out of<br>money<br>this case it was the investor who ran<br>out of money<br>because they listed on the asx and that<br>happened um<br>that's not a good thing um and so<br>uh oil really had to do something about<br>this<br>and they were brilliant absolutely<br>fantastic<br>and they went around and we found a new<br>investor um<br>at the beginning of 2017 2018 and that<br>was a company called pacific channel<br>based out of auckland and they have been<br>very very encouraging very understanding<br>and they really have their finger on the<br>pulse and they've invested in the<br>company but not just the company in<br>terms of<br>they want to make money out of this<br>right but they invest in the science and<br>the people they<br>they very strongly believe in that and<br>so<br>at the moment we have three candidates<br>in varying degrees of development<br>one is a lead market which is addressing<br>what i talked about<br>with the ed and ischemia and that seems<br>to have some potential and we're going<br>to test that in the exercise stress area<br>as well<br>we have another marker in the setting<br>potential of type 1 and type 2 heart<br>attacks<br>until about two or three years ago i<br>thought a heart attack was a heart<br>attack<br>there's not there's different grades of<br>them and you have to learn and<br>understand<br>and the differential differential<br>diagnosis between<br>a type 1 and type 2 heart attack is<br>important because there are cons<br>you know the treatments can be different<br>um and then also as mark and the others<br>have<br>elegantly alluded to you know what<br>happens after you've had the heart<br>attack what are the you know what's the<br>patient<br>prognosis going to be like um and we we<br>find it very important to leverage good<br>relationships with the um<br>chi of course and other cbd researchers<br>around the world<br>um and this is our mary crew so up here<br>is karen gina<br>he's the ceo of the company he's about<br>32 and he's an extremely able and<br>knowledgeable<br>and very smart 32. um<br>and we have also scientific assistants<br>whereas the mouse there it is from<br>robert powell<br>and we brought in these two um uh pirate<br>looking chaps here<br>uh john pickering on a data analytics<br>consultant<br>and prof martin team as well he's a<br>clinical consultant from the<br>point of view of the ed and this is our<br>um<br>the board itself is colin dawson who<br>used to be the head of otago innovation<br>he now<br>um is chair of our board of directors<br>and he has a lot of other<br>other companies and interests that he's<br>involved with um<br>roland todo who is a um he's a<br>phd in genetics as well but he's very<br>involved<br>in the situation company situation in<br>new zealand<br>two usa-based directors a chat called<br>gary pace<br>and uh professor judith swain who's a<br>trained cardiologist as well<br>and david christiansen there from oil<br>who's representing otago's interests<br>and on our panel of medical advisory<br>board<br>anthony demaria here who's a<br>cardiologist used to be the editor of<br>jack<br>james sunuzi and frank peacock who are<br>well-known collaborators to our group<br>and<br>prof matt richards with without who we<br>probably couldn't get half of this<br>done um<br>and so that's it so that's upstream in a<br>um we're changing tech now we're<br>actually um<br>changing modes of transport really we've<br>gone from new technologies to old<br>technologies now<br>um but this is talking about well this<br>presentation is about um<br>going back to grassroots level and i've<br>called it navigating the moana because<br>the moana<br>or the ocean is the one element that<br>connects aotearoa and the pacific<br>islands<br>and so actually the chi or christchurch<br>heart institute<br>have jumped into the waka with<br>maori and pacifica researchers to go out<br>and do<br>cardiovascular disease research in maori<br>and pacifica communities<br>and even before equity became a big<br>thing<br>as it is now um actually this was equity<br>or trying to address equity even before<br>it became<br>popular so<br>this is a traditional or a typical<br>polynesian walker<br>when you jump on board you are a crew<br>member and you actually have a role to<br>play<br>also too you're actually quite visible<br>as well<br>so in your crew you'll always have a<br>star navigator<br>someone who understands the environment<br>understands the winds and the currents<br>and the landmarks<br>so that they can direct the crew to<br>maneuver the waka<br>to their destination and so for the chi<br>um the first voyage was with the maori<br>indigenous health institute<br>and it was a maori led research project<br>called the hawaii manual community heart<br>study<br>and led by professor suzanne pitama who<br>we all know<br>who has amazing impact in the education<br>here at um otago medical school<br>and below is just some of the crew but<br>we actually also have some of the crew<br>here in the audience as well<br>who helped out with the study such as<br>mark richards richard trouten<br>gary nichols swaytonia also helped out<br>with the study<br>but in this photo i just wanted to point<br>out that there are<br>two non-maori so the rest of maori<br>researchers<br>or helped with the research and when<br>you've got a team<br>of strong maori researchers and you go<br>into<br>a maori community for us non-maori<br>researchers we actually feel really safe<br>and so we were<br>appropriately culturally guided by our<br>the actually the overall aim of the<br>study too was to actually<br>profile at the time current<br>cardiovascular respective profiles<br>in two maori communities so going into<br>one maori community is<br>is a lot of work but going to two is<br>even more than that so<br>the two communities were waido in the<br>hawke's bay that's a rural community<br>um ngati kahungunu and the second is<br>here in<br>ototahi tahu being the ewe too<br>before going into these communities<br>though there needs to be a connection<br>to the manafenua and fortunately within<br>mihi<br>we had connections to both communities<br>suzanne pitama is ngati kahungunu and<br>then we have others in the team like<br>matia gilles<br>tanya hiria who were affiliate or who<br>are affiliated with<br>ngaitahu so we began this study by<br>actually going into waidoa first of all<br>and so for each of these cohorts we had<br>to recruit 250 people<br>which doesn't sound a lot but actually<br>it's a lot of hard work<br>in the background um so what we did is<br>we jumped on our little waka of air new<br>zealand<br>and um this is us at the airport and<br>vikki showed this photo before<br>um i don't know if vikki remembered this<br>story but as we all got onto the plane<br>the captain's voice came over and said<br>oh<br>is there anyone here who would like to<br>offload their luggage because we're too<br>heavy<br>the plane can't leave unless we are the<br>right weight<br>and i think it was due to our two<br>containers of titi<br>that we took up as koha but we had a lot<br>of gear<br>um and so we started off in waiador and<br>we were based at the wairua<br>hospital so they kindly um gave us a few<br>clinic rooms to base ourselves in<br>for like a year and after repeated<br>visits<br>what we did have in the study which is<br>kind of outside of the<br>the outcomes for a typical grant was<br>actually having um<br>medical students and maori medical<br>students come in and participate<br>in the research and we also had our um<br>auckland crew rob and the<br>ecocardiographers come in as well<br>to take part in in the study um and as<br>you can see in the background<br>you probably can't see too well there's<br>a maori man<br>who's um lying on the bed with a blue<br>gown on<br>um part of the steady protocol was to<br>perform an echo<br>on every single participant in the<br>community and that they're pretty lucky<br>to get an echo<br>but normally in a hospital setting you'd<br>be lying on the bed<br>be chested and so for part of the crew<br>or the our research team we thought no<br>that's actually not going to be<br>acceptable<br>acceptable for maori and so<br>as well as researchers we became fashion<br>designers for the clinique where<br>the clinic we are and we designed a gown<br>which the echocardiographer could still<br>access and measure<br>the the things that they needed to do<br>but it also made the participant feel<br>comfortable<br>and safe and we thought originally that<br>you know for women that would be<br>kind of you know they'd take it on board<br>but the males we found also actually<br>accepted that as well<br>in addition to the crew we had people on<br>the people on the ground who actually<br>helped us recruit our participants<br>and then the at the photo at the bottom<br>we've got um hillary who was a nurse<br>who knew the community really well um<br>suzanne's mother who's who's<br>hugging hillary but also importantly<br>akomatoa uncle burton<br>who also helped to rally um participants<br>in waidoa so we managed to over the year<br>recruit about 252<br>participants in wairoa and we had a<br>great time<br>doing that we also then had to repeat<br>that in christchurch which<br>happened we we based ourselves at the<br>elmo's court if you remember that pink<br>building before it got knocked down<br>for about a year and um what we soon<br>realized<br>when analyzing some of this data was<br>actually<br>uh we're collecting all this data but<br>this is actually becoming an<br>intervention for some of these<br>participants<br>um so from really from really small<br>matters like losing weight<br>to really big matters like um this uh<br>the guy in the top right here<br>um he's a came in as a young fat maori<br>male who would run marathons<br>had his echo and was told actually he<br>needed to stop running<br>and running marathons and that in the<br>years to come he would actually have to<br>go<br>undergo heart surgery i think gary<br>nichols was the one that walked him over<br>to the hospital<br>he probably doesn't remember to come and<br>actually have<br>a full echo um performed on him so um he<br>did actually go on to have heart surgery<br>and he's actually grateful<br>um to the study that that was picked up<br>at the time so you do have those<br>incidental findings but<br>you know as well as collecting the data<br>and analyzing<br>it and publishing the data you have all<br>these other impacts that affect the<br>communities at large<br>um we also stayed in contact with all<br>the all of these participants for five<br>years<br>regularly so we actually had<br>face-to-face visits at year two and year<br>five<br>and then um throughout that time we were<br>i would send them<br>uh sort of newsletters uh two<br>newsletters a year<br>just to stay in contact with them and so<br>that was the the first voyage<br>and the second voyage is the pacific<br>heart study so naturally<br>um the pacific are our neighbors and i<br>am a samoan so i'm a pacific islander<br>myself<br>and we recruited some our participants<br>here in christchurch<br>again partnering up with a pacific<br>health provider here which made it much<br>easier to access and also base ourselves<br>to perform our studies<br>similarly we were also looking at<br>cardiovascular risk factors and<br>biomarkers<br>as well we had some of our uh pacific<br>friends help out with the study as well<br>you know important to try and sort of<br>build up that capacity and the<br>experience<br>um for our pacific people because again<br>trying to address the equity issue<br>um for pacific health and so<br>we've also got some ongoing exciting um<br>studies for the specific heart study<br>interventions as well as um the one<br>some work with the biomarker anti-pro<br>bnp<br>which just watched this space and then<br>um just some reflections i think you<br>know the the chi<br>have partnered up really well with maori<br>um and pacifica researchers<br>to enable us to tell our stories it's<br>important to have that perspective<br>and particularly when you're working<br>with communities<br>doing research that's responsive and<br>socially accountable<br>is really key but also staying connected<br>because<br>as in traveling in a waka going from<br>point a to point b<br>it's a long journey and similarly with<br>working with maori pacifica communities<br>it's a long<br>relationship um health and health<br>research is an intervention which was<br>just<br>you know a great uh byproduct of the<br>research<br>building workforce capacity and<br>obviously publishing our research<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
