Institute is the 2020 recipient of the University of Otago Research Group Award. <br>From its formation in the 1980s, the Christchurch Heart Institute has been internationally recognised for its work on the humoral regulation of human circulation in health and cardiovascular disease, with particular recognition given to its work in the biology of cardiac natriuretic peptides.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>listen to the cry of the bird calling<br>unite<br>unite be one united above bound below<br>tied together within and without<br>richard blakey foreign<br>everyone i'm richard blakey i'm the<br>deputy vice chancellor research and<br>enterprise at the university of otago<br>it's my pleasure and privilege to<br>welcome you here to the first ceremonial<br>part of our afternoon<br>celebrating the christchurch heart<br>institute and<br>we and others of the official party uh<br>very look forward very much to<br>the lectures that we're able to attend<br>we apologize now that we have to<br>at various times slip out a little bit<br>early but we wish you well for the<br>afternoon so<br>to our leaders in the division of health<br>sciences in the otago medical school<br>teenager<br>christchurch heart institute to members<br>of the public family and supporters of<br>the university of otago in christchurch<br>of<br>aspects to do with heart disease or<br>other<br>members who are here for the pure<br>interest and joy of hearing about<br>advanced research out of the university<br>of otago atena koto<br>i'm just going to say a few words by<br>introduction to outline the reason that<br>we are<br>joining here to recognize the christ<br>church art institute<br>as the recipients of the university of<br>otago's 2020 research group awards<br>we've heard today uh in our celebration<br>of the distinguished research medal from<br>uh professor murdoch for those that were<br>able to attend that research<br>uh is a team sport inherently i think<br>that was one of the key messages<br>although it wasn't<br>particularly the words that you used in<br>which<br>the influences and act and drive of<br>individuals is important<br>but the achievement is generally the<br>result of a huge<br>collective effort and so the university<br>of otago<br>has recognized this for the last<br>five or six years with the establishment<br>of the<br>research group award it is much more<br>difficult<br>to define criteria for<br>what the achievements of a group should<br>be how they should be recognized what<br>defines a group<br>rather than just a natural form of<br>collaboration<br>but we have gone about that<br>and many of the requirements for the<br>group award<br>reflect the requirements of individual<br>achievement of outstanding scholarly<br>achievement<br>but in this case it's got to enhance<br>understanding development<br>and well-being of the individuals in<br>society so when we get together<br>collectively<br>as a research group it's very much more<br>often<br>the case that it's not to drive<br>fundamental knowledge and understanding<br>that is very critical<br>sometimes that does require good group<br>effort but it is really to drive<br>to impact a strong eye to impact is much<br>more what is needed to be the recipients<br>of the university of otago group award<br>and we can identify that for example one<br>of the other past recipient groups<br>has been the group from the dunedin<br>multi-disciplinary health and<br>development<br>research study that has over many many<br>years over 40 years plus<br>contributed alongside the christchurch<br>cohort that<br>is another one of the tanga form<br>university of otago<br>contributed to those knowledges and<br>understanding<br>for well-being of people<br>and so we call for applications every<br>year in about february march and we<br>receive an interesting cohort and this<br>year the standout<br>nomination was from the christchurch<br>heart institute<br>and many of you as you will see today<br>will see<br>over many many years over over<br>about 40 years or so that long-standing<br>heritage of achievement that whakapapa<br>that has come<br>through uh that makes it quite clear and<br>obvious however<br>when we define the criteria we<br>make it a little bit harder for the<br>nominators we we say that<br>whilst we can recognize long history and<br>heritage of achievement<br>you cannot just rest on laurels and say<br>we did wonderful work a long time ago<br>so please recognize us now the real work<br>the real assessment is on work that has<br>been undertaken<br>during the last five years so that's why<br>i particularly like your program that<br>you recognize<br>those that came before and the the<br>heritage of the christchurch heart<br>institute<br>but the panel that made this<br>recommendation to the vice chancellor<br>for this award<br>could not formally recognize that they<br>recognized that through that there was a<br>great deal of leadership and capability<br>development<br>but it was really the achievements over<br>the last five years that that<br>is the genesis is the um<br>at the core of of this award<br>and so we have um an afternoon's program<br>that has um at its conclusion some of<br>the<br>future leaders current and future<br>and i am<br>drawn to just a couple of final<br>reflections<br>before i ask professor murdoch to<br>introduce the<br>christchurch heart institute that that<br>impact sheets home<br>in in health and by medical sciences to<br>us<br>in a very personal way very often and in<br>fact just over the last week<br>i had called to reflect on that through<br>a very close member of our family<br>uh presenting in the morning with a um<br>a bit of a turn that then turned into a<br>visit to the um to the gp that then<br>turned into<br>a ride in the ambulance to an afternoon<br>in hospital<br>uh being subjected to a range of tests<br>that i'm sure<br>included for opponent and bnp and a<br>number of other things that the<br>christchurch heart institute has led<br>directly to which fortunately led to the<br>the pleasant outcome of you have got an<br>interesting heart rhythm but<br>we don't think that you've suffered a a<br>critical cardiac event<br>so we all have elements in our life with<br>people that are close to us<br>who have been affected positively by<br>this and i leave<br>i leave with a statement that we had<br>from professor mark richards in our<br>hakitinga global when<br>talking about the global impact of<br>research that when you<br>consider that there might be 25 million<br>people in the world<br>with heart failure facing 20 to 25<br>annual mortality<br>that's more than a million fewer lives<br>lost annually<br>should our findings be applied worldwide<br>so that is the level of achievement that<br>we are recognizing here<br>uh with the award of the university's<br>research group award to the christchurch<br>a heart institute<br>so please on behalf of the university<br>let's firstly congratulate that group<br>for this award<br>as i invite professor david murdock to<br>uh talk a little bit about their<br>and i was about to say for those who<br>don't know me i think i know most people<br>but<br>i'm david murdock the dean and head of<br>campus university of otago christchurch<br>and really<br>great pleasure to introduce the<br>christchurch heart institute and i<br>promise i'll keep it brief even just to<br>keep my voice<br>intact really<br>it really does give me great pleasure i<br>think anyone who's been<br>in christchurch anytime know that this<br>group is really<br>a cornerstone of health research in the<br>city both on this campus and beyond<br>and it really would be unusual to think<br>about<br>health research without thinking of the<br>christchurch heart and just institute<br>and i must admit i feel like i've grown<br>i've matured with the group anyway<br>without actually being a member<br>and i mean i can go back and remember as<br>a medical student under erika spinner<br>and gary<br>nichols and in fact i was your house<br>surgeon<br>as well in the world ward b3 quite a<br>long time ago<br>and i'm i'm sure that i probably took<br>part in some of those studies at the<br>time<br>what seemed to happen during ward rounds<br>yeah gary's not in here i think we would<br>often be<br>taken aside and have some blood tests<br>taken during<br>during the day and apparently many<br>details about the studies beyond that<br>and that was mark richards registrar at<br>one stage and<br>i actually recall mark's acumen and<br>infectious diseases because he actually<br>diagnosed me with glandular fever which<br>i don't think you probably remember<br>i was unwell and he insisted i was<br>tested and made a correct diagnosis<br>but that was that was some time ago but<br>the the group is certainly notable<br>for many things and i think for me it's<br>it's been the<br>bringing along a succession of<br>really bright young talent and taking<br>them through<br>to maturity into leadership positions<br>within the group<br>and that seems to have happened<br>throughout the journey<br>and then work that really<br>crosses both the lab and the clinical in<br>a in a great way<br>um and in terms of both fundamental<br>science<br>and diagnostic science in addition to<br>the<br>the clinical aspects in a way i've i've<br>very rarely<br>seen and done and systematically and<br>connected<br>and relevant and with a clear focus<br>on doing clinically relevant impactful<br>research and<br>i've only seen it you know since i've<br>been dean only seen more visibility<br>of that and and really that impressive<br>focus on on the best<br>of all science so really it's it's<br>absolutely great pleasure that i<br>introduce the group and and to say that<br>i'm a very proud dean<br>to know that you've received this award<br>because it's absolutely deserved so<br>i will um hand over to mark but<br>congratulations to the group on a<br>well-deserved award<br>kia ora it has to be all downhill after<br>that i think<br>so just to remind you if you're not<br>familiar with us we're about 50 people<br>we divide and naturally into four<br>disciplines and we work together and<br>that's been the key to our<br>success such as it is that we do get<br>along and we do<br>work off each other's strengths we are<br>hosted within<br>the university of otago christchurch and<br>we're closely linked with clinical<br>departments<br>and we have a lot of external<br>connections as well which i won't take<br>up time with at the moment<br>and we take as our brief freedom to<br>examine anything to do with<br>cardiovascular<br>risk and disease and you can divide that<br>into stages<br>a to d and a you might just be carrying<br>something<br>like a bit of high blood pressure but<br>you're perfectly well by the time you<br>get through to d you really should be<br>writing your will and talking<br>to your friends and we take permission<br>to<br>investigate each point of this cascade<br>and biomarkers and the things that we<br>have taken time<br>getting involved with play a role<br>particularly at the sharp end of disease<br>but progressively<br>it's obvious that measuring markers<br>earlier and earlier in the stages of<br>pre-morbid states where risk is present<br>but disease is not yet present<br>offers value clinically so we're trying<br>to move<br>we're trying to keep our place at the<br>sharp end but spread our<br>canvas right into the community<br>and the story for me but not for those<br>senior to me<br>began at princess margaret hospital in<br>1983<br>where we had endocrinology and<br>cardiology and respiratory medicine all<br>based there for<br>for the christchurch health board and<br>this man<br>mohammed iqrim professor hamer dikram<br>who is with us today<br>was a very cardinal part of this whole<br>deal<br>hamad brought christchurch screaming and<br>struggling into the 20th century with<br>respect to cardiology and introduced<br>things like left heart catheterization<br>much to the<br>horror intrepidation of many of our even<br>more senior colleagues but<br>he made cardiology in christchurch what<br>it is today<br>now you might recognize a couple of<br>people here you know<br>37 years i don't think i could grow a<br>moustache like that anymore<br>i think the ratio of spectacle lens to<br>facial surface area was there was the<br>competition at the time<br>and i still wear a white coat and a tie<br>both of which are quite ill-advised<br>really from a microbiological point of<br>view i'm sure david would agree<br>and this is eric who's so old-fashioned<br>with his facial hair and we had a<br>project and the project was to measure<br>contemporaneously<br>systemic arterial pressure by an<br>ambulatory device<br>and also pulmonary arterial pressure<br>which involves putting a catheter<br>through a vein<br>through the right heart into the<br>pulmonary artery and then getting people<br>to get up and walk around<br>now this was not my idea this was gary<br>nichols and hammett<br>or gamut and harry as we used to call<br>them sometimes actually conspiring<br>they thought this was a good thing to do<br>and i was really<br>completely unaware that logistically and<br>technically this is almost impossible so<br>we did it<br>and a lot of what's happened since then<br>has been a bit like that<br>so we had people to help us tom tanner's<br>a technician<br>most won't remember lisa brabont was a<br>technical person in the lab<br>well i was struck by the fact that they<br>would always line up to have these<br>things done and<br>kiwis are characterized by participation<br>they take part in research they seldom<br>say no<br>and that is in sharp contrast to other<br>places where i have worked<br>there's also expertise in the background<br>so long before i have arrived<br>gary was well known in the field of the<br>reno ninja tension elder stern system in<br>that domain<br>and we had a conversation on one<br>occasion in which i said um<br>you know the natural peptides are really<br>important you can't live without them<br>tiny shifts actually alter your<br>physiology and he said to me well i<br>thought the world revolved around the<br>renal<br>tension system so we came to a<br>compromise and this book is<br>is still the bible really i think of<br>reading ninja tension system<br>original work and and data<br>so the place was set up uh with<br>expertise if you like<br>this is a 1984 picture with hammond and<br>gary looking pretty frisky in geneva the<br>first ever<br>international conference i ever went to<br>the international society of<br>hypertension<br>this is gary just a few days ago and<br>this is hammered about three years back<br>when he got his his birthday honours and<br>i think<br>these three people can take the credit<br>for what's become of us<br>all because the cardiologist<br>hamad eker and the endocrinologist eric<br>espen are both master clinicians<br>glued together by a cardiovascular<br>endocrinologist with a kind of gluing<br>together tendency<br>really it's a conversation between these<br>three people that made<br>what was first the cardioendocrine<br>research group and laterally became the<br>christchurch heart institute<br>made it possible and creative in the way<br>that it is and has<br>so there are a lot of things we can talk<br>about we've already delved into about 20<br>different biological systems over time<br>but i'll just focus on the one that we<br>seem to be best known for<br>which is the cardiac naturally peptides<br>and our fortune favors the prepared mind<br>and it turned out<br>that long before amp and bnp actually<br>were discovered<br>gary was waiting for them to arrive so<br>he had a hypothesis which she published<br>in the lancet<br>in the days when i think you could<br>publish hypotheses in the lancet i'm not<br>sure you can anymore<br>but the bottom line there was that there<br>seemed to be the need for something else<br>to balance salt and water in the body<br>and there's likely to be an accurate<br>hormone<br>which augments electrolyte excretion and<br>sure enough<br>there was some electron microscopy data<br>these granules appear in atrial cells<br>and<br>mammals and they get bigger and smaller<br>and darker and lighter depending upon<br>the<br>volume and salt status of the animal and<br>then<br>adolfo de bold a chilean man working in<br>ontario<br>took the simple step of grinding up<br>atria making an extract and injecting it<br>into rats and produced this tremendous<br>surge in sodium excretion<br>and not long after that the actual<br>active element was identified<br>atrial naturally peptide we got hold of<br>some or i think it was gary who got hold<br>of it<br>probably from bristol myers squibb and<br>we injected it into our cells<br>and lo and behold actually people are<br>just like rats<br>they have this big spike in sodium if<br>you give them enough amp<br>the dose of amp was 100 micrograms we<br>hadn't figured out how to measure amp by<br>that stage we didn't realize we were<br>giving ourselves<br>what was actually a sledgehammer blow a<br>peptide to completely pharmacological<br>and non-physiological levels but we were<br>pleased that we produced<br>a result like this and actually all of<br>the guinea pigs were all of the authors<br>so it was actually a pretty<br>pretty good outcome around and actually<br>we are all still around<br>which is after 37 years not to be taken<br>for granted<br>um and then we got a little more<br>sophisticated and found that very subtle<br>increments in a amp<br>infused could produce very readily<br>detectable changes in salt balance and<br>blood pressure<br>and renin levels and this is a paper<br>that was penned by eric<br>and published in lance a year or two<br>later<br>and then we decided there might be<br>clinical applications we were really<br>interested in the biology that's what<br>really got us into in the first place<br>but the clinical applications really<br>started to cohere or coalesce<br>when eric got together with mark davis<br>was with us today<br>and said this might be a diagnostic<br>and indeed turned out to be true that a<br>bnp of a certain threshold<br>was very sensitive testing quite<br>specific for identifying<br>acute heart failure amongst people who<br>were turning up to the emergency<br>department<br>with shortness of breath mark's with us<br>now working the waikato eric still with<br>us still generating new data on new<br>projects<br>so this led on later to discovery of nt<br>pro bmp which is really a very much a<br>christchurch and university of otago<br>discovery<br>it was theorised that it should exist<br>tim meander in particular believed it<br>should be present<br>and went out of his way to then go and<br>prove that it was and this very simple<br>table in this humble journal<br>really doesn't really need statistics<br>you can see that in normal people<br>into your pro bmp is a long way lower<br>than in heart failure you don't even<br>need to draw a graph to see that and the<br>p-value<br>clearly has a very large number of zeros<br>in front of it and that assay was set up<br>using radio immune assay systems and<br>led by tim and i put them together here<br>with a rather dashing chris charles<br>but i've picked this picture because<br>it's the typical tim yandle<br>expression he's got his head turned to<br>one side he's looking at you out of the<br>side of his eyes<br>he's smiling i mean your harm but you<br>will have to prove that before i really<br>believe what you're saying to me<br>and he's been succeeded uh by chris<br>who has discovered new galaxies of<br>potential markers that people<br>dogmatically didn't believe could<br>possibly exist the signal peptides in<br>particular<br>and you'll hear more from some of these<br>folk later in the afternoon but<br>these people have generated chris tim<br>and those that work with them the team<br>in the lab that have worked with them<br>have generated<br>original assays numbering 20 or 30 over<br>the last<br>30 or so years and validated them often<br>before anybody else in the world has<br>done so<br>and this is our star marker anti-pro bnp<br>it's derived from pro bnp<br>and we found that it was useful<br>after all said and done looking at quite<br>large numbers of people coming through<br>the emergency department<br>if you are short of breath and you do<br>have antiprobemp above certain levels<br>it's a sensitive and specific test for<br>heart failure and it's hard to remember<br>now how<br>salutary that was there was no blood<br>test for heart failure it was entirely<br>clinical<br>and the error rate was roughly 50<br>usually fortunately in the direction of<br>over diagnosis rather than under<br>diagnosis<br>but you know the test has made a huge<br>amount of improvement globally around<br>the world<br>and it's a test which is used literally<br>hundreds of thousands of times<br>per year in every most centres<br>and aside from being diagnostic it told<br>us a little bit about the future so this<br>is a bunch of people with heart attacks<br>over 600<br>people with myocardial infarctions we<br>found that if you were above a certain<br>threshold your risks over the next 120<br>days after your heart attack<br>were considerably worse than if you had<br>and this is all dependent upon<br>participation by very many patients this<br>is a slide put together by vicky<br>who clearly has more artistic talent<br>than i do but each circle represents a<br>cohort<br>if you add up all these numbers that<br>equates to something like 13 000 people<br>that have participated<br>in chi studies over time and some of<br>them are still<br>contributing data even now i'd like to<br>say<br>a word about these young champs this is<br>in the 90s sometime or other<br>i particularly like to acknowledge<br>richard who has been a 2ic and a<br>clinical leader<br>particularly over the last decade or<br>more holding things together for our<br>clinical studies<br>in a skilled and humble fashion<br>i'd also like to acknowledge the fact<br>that we have collaborators up and down<br>the country rob doughty<br>i think still with us in the room has to<br>leave early you're still here so we have<br>a cohort stay this is one of several<br>that have operated between auckland and<br>in christchurch between auckland<br>university and university of otago<br>this is the was originally the acute<br>coronary syndrome study and then i<br>decided i was really interested in<br>chronic events so i changed its name<br>not a good idea don't do that just find<br>a nice acronym and stick with it<br>however over a number of years we<br>recruited over 2 000 people and they<br>have been yielding a lot of data<br>these are data that were put together by<br>phil adamson one of our more recent<br>arrivals in the group<br>and obviously had a greater artistic<br>sense than i've ever had<br>at putting data together and these are<br>troponin levels both early and then<br>later stages after a coronary event and<br>you can see that some of them remain<br>high right out at to<br>several months later even though this is<br>a test which is supposed to be used as<br>an acute on the day at the time test<br>it really is looking abnormal for a very<br>long period and what are<br>mainly stable patients and that actually<br>runs alongside outcome<br>so if you have a heart attack and your<br>troponin stays up your likelihood of<br>striking a fatal event over the<br>ensuing years is clearly much greater<br>than if that does not happen<br>and that fact and similar data related<br>to anti-pro bmp<br>are being used by rob at the moment to<br>lead a national study<br>adding in markers at the months after a<br>current event to see if you can improve<br>outcome by being guided by that<br>we're linked with genetics and<br>epigenetics and i think vicky's<br>now group is now called the omics group<br>this is vicky at earlier and slightly<br>later stages in<br>the chi trajectory i think before and<br>after birthday honours i think<br>ricky and some of our graduates<br>and what happened there is we combined<br>genotyping with markers and this is one<br>example<br>published in the journal of american<br>college of cardiology whereby you could<br>find that<br>a particular insertion deletion<br>change in the ace angiotensin converting<br>gene coupled with measurement of bnp<br>could give you an idea about outcomes<br>also post myocardial infarction<br>and that's one of very many genetic<br>studies and genomic typing studies that<br>vicky and anna have led since then these<br>cohorts when they're well planned and<br>well<br>annotated and deeply detailed just keep<br>on giving and giving<br>and the most recent example is the one<br>on the right hand side of the page there<br>which is<br>published in circulation a<br>co-top-ranking cardiovascular journal<br>and it's a study done in collaboration<br>with singapore we've had a lot of work<br>together with that country<br>in the last 10 years and really it<br>looked at people that had suffered a<br>heart attack<br>both in new zealand the cdcs cohort and<br>in singapore the immaculate cohort<br>did a rather sophisticated form of<br>proteomics on them<br>took single cells from other models both<br>human cells and rodent cells and looked<br>for common factors that occurred after<br>ischemic injury<br>the idea being to be who is going to<br>evolve in an adverse fashion<br>who will eventually arrive at heart<br>failure either in the intermediate or<br>longer term<br>after they have a coronary event and we<br>arrive at some targets some of which<br>were reassuringly obvious like nt<br>pro bmp and troponin but some others<br>that are not so obvious in which we're<br>now<br>enjoying exploring in greater depth so<br>that's a 2020 contribution<br>animals we've depended upon animal<br>models over time this is chris who<br>recently published a rather nice review<br>of animal models of heart failure<br>this figure is derived from that and he<br>works alongside miriam<br>who works with the sheep and this is a<br>model where you can pace animals in and<br>out of heart failure<br>which is unique a large animal closely<br>monitored<br>and with pressure measurements in the<br>heart and the in the vessels<br>uh measurement of the neural hormonal<br>status in the circulation<br>measurement of kidney function and<br>moving into failure and back out again<br>that's a unique asset which you'll only<br>find in a handful of places around the<br>world<br>and we've coupled this together from<br>omix studies<br>so we took kidney biopsies serially<br>swatania palma helped us<br>as the sheep moved in and out of failure<br>and then ran<br>rna-seq or a kind of global rna<br>expression analysis led by anna pilbrow<br>who's having one of her elfin days when<br>this picture was taken<br>and she has identified genetic gene<br>targets<br>that may relate to kidney injury in the<br>context of heart failure<br>so it's an example of cross-disciplinary<br>partnership<br>and also keeping up with the joneses in<br>terms of modern technologies<br>impact i'm near the end so don't become<br>too anxious<br>impact we do think we do try to<br>translate and this is an excerpt from<br>the<br>2016 european society of cardiology<br>guidelines<br>on the diagnosis and management of heart<br>failure and they are still extent they<br>still applies<br>and i remember when antipro bmp was<br>first published<br>back in the 90s and people asked us<br>well do you really need that i don't<br>need that but things have moved along a<br>lot since then<br>and what it says here is if you've got<br>someone in front of you who you suspect<br>might have heart failure<br>you should always measure an<br>anti-pro-bnp or a bnp<br>and the strength of recommendation is<br>the highest strength of recommendation<br>with the highest class<br>evidence ever given in universal<br>guidelines<br>and this is repeated in the american<br>guidelines and the australasian<br>guidelines and the uk nice guidelines<br>and our fingerprints are all over that<br>we actually influence clinical behaviour<br>in emergency departments all over the<br>world<br>every day second to last slide<br>this would not be complete without<br>acknowledging the heart foundation the<br>heart foundation has supported the chair<br>that i hold at the moment chair of<br>cardiovascular studies it's also<br>supported rob doughty in his own chair<br>and<br>that collaborative link between the two<br>chairs and we have done our bit<br>here's vicky and myself sitting on the<br>scientific advisory<br>group in 2006 so this is what we looked<br>like 14 years ago<br>haven't changed a bit really have we and<br>these are all people that have been<br>valuable colleagues in the process as<br>well<br>particularly norman sharp warrants<br>mentioned he was leader of the group<br>that rob has subsequently led very ably<br>since<br>but was always a major supporter of<br>christchurch cardiovascular efforts<br>and the heart foundation has provided<br>the chi and its predecessor<br>form with millions of dollars<br>effectively over the last several<br>decades<br>and finally this is most of us but not<br>all of us i think it's about 30 out of<br>the 50 of us<br>and this is what we look like in august<br>2019<br>30 years down the track with some<br>newcomers so phil<br>whom we are depending upon to lead the<br>charge and chris<br>to continue to leave the charge some<br>older sort of<br>not so newcomers lorraine who leads our<br>clinical coordination group myself<br>richard who is looking very senior and<br>mature these days<br>and our status just in here who also<br>um has been with us a very long time<br>and i'd like to apologize now because<br>whenever anybody does this they will<br>miss<br>people out and things out that are<br>actually really important<br>and later this evening i'll be kicking<br>myself repeatedly as i remember<br>a really important thing that gary or<br>eric or<br>somebody else in the lab did or a study<br>that we published that warranted<br>mentioned or a particular achievement<br>and i beg forgiveness for that and thank<br>you for your attention we are profoundly<br>grateful to<br>all of the people who work with us both<br>within the group and beyond the group<br>you<br>thank you very much mark and uh before i<br>hand over to vicki as the emcee for the<br>for the presentations there is a<br>formality to deal with in terms of the<br>presentation of something to the<br>christ church heart institute for the<br>university of otago group award<br>i would like to invite the vice<br>chancellor to come up and<br>also the i think the steering group for<br>the christchurch heart institute<br>are going to receive on behalf of the<br>university a token of our appreciation<br>for your efforts in recognition of<br>receiving the</p></main><footer
