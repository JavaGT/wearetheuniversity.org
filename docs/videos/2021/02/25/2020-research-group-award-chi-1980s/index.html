deputy dean here at the<br>university of otago christchurch<br>and a research professor with the christ<br>church heart institute<br>i'm going to be your mc for this this<br>afternoon's celebrations<br>of the christchurch heart institute<br>heart research group award<br>sorry research group award we are<br>dividing the afternoon into four sets of<br>talks<br>each representing a decade that the<br>group has been<br>in existence with two to three speakers<br>presenting some research highlights<br>from each decade we've got a lot to fit<br>in<br>and time is tight so we won't be able to<br>take questions after each<br>of the talks but i invite you all to<br>stay around for afternoon tea afterwards<br>when you can save your questions for the<br>speakers at that stage<br>before each set of talks i'm going to<br>give a brief<br>pictorial history of that decade to set<br>the scene<br>so this will introduce you to the people<br>rather than the science<br>hopefully it'll be a lighter look so<br>let's get started if i can get the<br>so<br>right we now have three talks from<br>some of those judo masters first we will<br>hear from emeritus professor<br>gary nichols whose specialty is<br>understanding the regulation of water<br>and salt balance in the body then we're<br>going to hear from associate professor<br>tim yandle<br>whose special skill is setting up tests<br>to measure blood levels of newly<br>discovered<br>hormones and our third speaker is<br>emeritus professor eric espina whose<br>area of<br>expertise is understanding the body's<br>response to stress<br>including the effects of stress on the<br>heart gary would you like to kick off<br>please<br>good afternoon i want to share with you<br>an<br>anecdote from 40 years ago<br>way before the naturality peptides were<br>even thought of<br>and it's to do with the<br>first administration of an ace inhibitor<br>in one of the first administrations in<br>the world for a patient with severe<br>heart failure as you know is a condition<br>when the heart is insulted for example<br>by a heart attack<br>and the remaining muscle struggles to<br>provide adequate<br>supply of essential components right<br>throughout the body<br>and as the heart failure worsens then<br>the renal angiotensin system is<br>activated proportionally<br>so in severe heart failure there's very<br>high levels of angiotensin<br>ii circulating formed by the enzyme ace<br>well the story really begins with both<br>rops jurarica<br>this south american pit viper<br>some very clever biochemists in the<br>scribd company in the united states<br>worked out<br>that the venom of the snake contained an<br>ace inhibitor<br>a substance that blocked ice and<br>therefore would drop angiotensin 2<br>levels in the blood<br>and should open up the little arterioles<br>throughout the body<br>based on that knowledge two very smart<br>biochemists in<br>the squib company in the states<br>synthesized<br>um a couple of drugs that should block<br>the system<br>so this is about 1980 and mr jay<br>is in the wards with really terminal<br>heart failure<br>most unwell sitting in bed panting<br>unable to eat sweating pale very low<br>blood pressure<br>we managed to persuade the squid company<br>through the local<br>company in auckland to get one of these<br>new drugs<br>from america well before it was<br>available for<br>and mr jay agreed<br>readily to take on this unknown<br>and<br>trying to persuade us that he was a<br>close relative of napoleon<br>but so mr jordan<br>agreed mr j agreed to be a guinea pig<br>for this new drug princess margaret<br>hospital<br>sitting in a recovery bed just below the<br>operating theatres<br>1980 or so<br>hammered put in the catheters by which<br>we could see whether<br>the response was good or bad from<br>cardiac function and arterial pressure<br>and we gave the first dose of this drug<br>silence and we watched and after 10 or<br>15 minutes the blood pressure started to<br>fall<br>after 20 minutes the blood pressure<br>continued to fall from a very low<br>baseline and i can tell you our blood<br>pressure started to fall<br>and i remember wondering where the<br>nearest toilet was at that stage but by<br>30 or 40 minutes<br>the pale skin became pink<br>his breathing clearly improved<br>and despite the low blood pressure a big<br>smile came across his face in<br>his face and he said geez and it really<br>was a marvelous moment that i suspect<br>hammered<br>we continued the drug over the next five<br>days there's mr j<br>i don't think the color is true there<br>but there's no doubt he was pink<br>whereas when he came in before the drug<br>he was just<br>so pale it was unbelievable as i say<br>this was a bed below the operating<br>he continued on the drug after having<br>his catheters removed and a couple of<br>weeks later he walked out of the<br>hospital<br>which was just a miracle to us and we<br>followed him up in the outpatient<br>department<br>and the rest is history really we<br>studied five<br>patients like mr j and published the<br>results in the lancet medical journal<br>and the rest is history really<br>big studies overseas showed that not<br>only was there a clinical<br>improvement of major magnitude but<br>longevity was increased as well<br>and that was kept to pull and many<br>prills followed later and they become<br>standard treatment<br>so that was one of the early studies 40<br>years ago and it brought together the<br>whole team<br>as has been mentioned dietitians<br>biochemist<br>lab technicians biostatistician<br>biochemists as well as the doctors and<br>we were<br>very grateful to such patients as mr j<br>yes well i'm going to really present<br>results on two of the nitrite pool<br>hormones from uh the early days<br>these are atrial naturalic peptide and<br>b-type<br>naturality peptide they're both secreted<br>by the heart<br>and they act on the candida induce a<br>loss of sodium and water through the<br>kidney<br>and to reduce blood pressure<br>they belong to this small family of<br>naturally peptides<br>which have the cyclic ring structure<br>here<br>now in 1984 i began setting up an assay<br>to measure amp in the plasma of patients<br>that was a difficult task but i<br>succeeded<br>after raising antibodies to the peptide<br>and developing a method to extract and<br>concentrate and p<br>from the plasma prior to asa and then at<br>the very beginning<br>we used the assay to measure the amp<br>concentrations and a number of subjects<br>and you can see that the circulating<br>levels of a<br>p and normal healthy subjects from our<br>point of view were reasonably low<br>and patients with heart failure they<br>were generally raised and some of them<br>markedly so<br>they were also raised in patients with<br>renal failure<br>and with corn syndrome so these studies<br>really<br>proved the worth of the assay and was<br>later used<br>for many studies in both their clinical<br>and animal groups in the<br>i used the essay myself for my own work<br>to characterize the forms<br>of amps circulating in the blood of<br>heart failure patients<br>hplc separation of anp peptides and<br>plasma<br>and using the assay to detect the anp<br>coming out of our hplc column<br>uh this large peak here eluted at the<br>position of a and p<br>um but you can see that that peak was a<br>relatively minor component of everything<br>that was diluting off<br>that column so i then went ahead and<br>extracted a large volume of plasma<br>uh purified the material substantially<br>and then put it back through the column<br>and then i sent these two major peaks<br>down to<br>the needing for amino acid sequencing to<br>further identify what was in them<br>and the sequencing data that came back<br>from alan khan and dunedin<br>showed that the main peak there was in<br>fact the complete a<br>p molecule as we sort of expected but in<br>reality this was the first definitive<br>identification of the main circulating<br>form of amp in humans<br>the smaller peak here was a metabolite<br>of anp<br>which we called cleaved amp because it<br>was<br>uh produced by cleavage at this point<br>here in the ring structure of a<br>p by the enzyme nepalison now i don't<br>have a lot of time<br>to detail all the flow on effects but<br>chris charles has shown that the<br>cleaved inp peptide is actually inactive<br>biologically<br>so that means that one cleavage at this<br>point here by neprolysin<br>inactivates anp following that a number<br>of drugs companies became<br>interested and made inhibitors of<br>nepalison<br>to block this degradation pathway and<br>chris charles will be further<br>talking on the subject on the subject<br>later<br>on the study he's done using an<br>inhibitor<br>i'll move on now to studies that we did<br>with<br>bnp peptides bnp was first i<br>identified in 1988 and<br>was subsequently shown to be synthesized<br>in the<br>heart by this long precursor pro bnp<br>and that precursor was cleaved at that<br>point<br>to give rise to the biologically active<br>circulating form of a<br>p so at that point i established an<br>essay to measure uh bnp and plasma<br>and that actually underpin a lot of the<br>subsequent<br>clinical studies that were done in the<br>group<br>but i also used the essay to investigate<br>what was happening with pro-bnp<br>and was able to show that in addition to<br>it being present in the heart<br>it was also circulating in the plasma of<br>patients with heart failure<br>and then encouraged by that finding we<br>then<br>looked for what happened to this amino<br>terminal fragment<br>of the pro-bnp molecule so the question<br>really was<br>did this fragment appear in the<br>circulate to circulate in humans<br>fortunately we had penny hunt available<br>to do that work<br>for her md thesis and she raised<br>antibodies to<br>the amino tumor lender this putative<br>peptide which we called<br>and then having she developed an assay<br>to<br>that fragment and then having developed<br>the assay<br>she then used hplc to separate<br>um the bnp related peptides<br>by on the on the column<br>and collected fractions and then assayed<br>those<br>with the first with the bnp assay now<br>the bnp assay shows the<br>initial peak that we usually got with<br>probe<br>alerting early and the smaller<br>biologically active peak coming in here<br>and we were predicting that the uh if we<br>if a minor general probe<br>circulated at all we'd see a little peak<br>somewhere in here<br>but i was in fact greatly surprised by<br>this enormous peak<br>of the minor terminal probing p alluding<br>at exactly<br>the position that amp should elude<br>so this was the first identification of<br>amino terminal pro<br>present in the blood of any species<br>penny then went on to measure the<br>concentrations<br>uh of amino terminal probemp in patients<br>with heart failure<br>and so they increased with increasing<br>severity<br>of heart failure and not only that but<br>these levels as mark has already<br>outlined<br>uh massively greater than the<br>immunoterminal<br>probiemp concentrations in normal people<br>so that study really concluded that<br>aminoterminal<br>uh pro bnp was an early cardiac<br>so we were delighted to find this new<br>peptide but much<br>work has been done since and it had many<br>outcomes<br>and from that as mark has already<br>alluded to uh studies by mark and<br>richard trowson have shown that<br>the anti-pro-bnp assay can be used to<br>diagnose heart failure<br>the anti-probium psas were then made<br>available on big commercial<br>automated analyzers by a company in<br>germany<br>and that spread the assay's diagnostic<br>use<br>worldwide and finally the immunoterminal<br>probium p<br>is now strongly recommended for use in<br>the diagnosis of heart failure<br>and both american and european<br>guidelines<br>and this study had a lot of<br>collaborative work in it and i'd like to<br>acknowledge the significant input that<br>both gary nichols and eric have spent<br>as we've already heard from mark and<br>others<br>uh these 15 years<br>the in the 80s through to 1990 were very<br>exciting ones for<br>the cardioendocrine group and we studied<br>a number of features<br>that reflected the actions of these<br>hormones a and p<br>and bmp in normal people and in people<br>with heart failure<br>and also the metabolism of those same<br>hormones<br>and very importantly as tim has alluded<br>to the measurements<br>of amp and bnp in different<br>cardiovascular disorders so we were well<br>advanced<br>in our thinking by the end of 1980 and<br>we<br>came up with this concept that<br>if the heart suffered some injury or<br>damage<br>then the ability to eject the right<br>amount of blood<br>into the circulation would be impaired<br>and there would be a buildup of<br>intracardiac pressure<br>that increase in intracardiac pressure<br>would lead to increased<br>release of these cardiac hormones<br>remembering that the heart was not known<br>as an endocrine gland<br>until these times and these hormones<br>circulated in the blood<br>to act on a number of different tissues<br>in fact<br>the tissues that maintain the health and<br>integrity of a normal cardiovascular<br>system<br>it led to the renal excretion of salt<br>and water if the heart was overloaded<br>this increase in intracardiac pressure<br>generating antnp<br>these hormones generated more excretion<br>of salt and water<br>and they reduced the hormones that would<br>normally<br>lead to re-absorption of those same<br>electrolytes<br>not only that these hormones opened up<br>the resistance vessels<br>so that the blood pressure would fall<br>and take the strain off the heart<br>and thirdly they would shift some fluid<br>from the overloaded<br>circular the circulation plasma<br>component<br>into the interstitial space further<br>reducing<br>um the circulatory pressure and in the<br>classic<br>endocrine negative feedback sense reduce<br>the initial problem<br>which was a build up in cardiac pressure<br>well it doesn't take rocket science to<br>think that the<br>level of amp and bnp might reflect<br>and i was thinking of just how we could<br>make use of that<br>as a clinician often faced with people<br>admitted<br>under my care with acute breathlessness<br>shortness of breath they were gasping<br>for breath and not been able to be sure<br>whether this was because of<br>lack of oxygenation or chronic<br>obstructive airways disease a very<br>common problem<br>or was it due to heart failure and in<br>fact<br>we would peer at some length at the neck<br>looking for engorged veins<br>and it was very difficult to see in the<br>person who was laboring<br>to get air and move their chest we tried<br>to find evidence of excess fluid for<br>instance with<br>any edema presence swelling of the ankle<br>or with the crackles of the lung bases<br>we were really guessing as to whether<br>this was airways disease or heart<br>failure<br>so i thought that was not<br>a good situation to be in we needed to<br>have a test<br>and why wouldn't we measure bnp if it<br>was a marker of cardiac<br>stress surely that would distinguish<br>heart failure<br>from a person who was struggling to get<br>out for another reason<br>so fortunately we had a very active<br>medical student mark davis who's in the<br>audience today<br>and we were able to initiate a study<br>which led to the um study of some<br>52 people admitted to the emergency room<br>acutely breathless the study<br>would involve the normal treatment best<br>treatment possible for that condition<br>whether it was thought to be heart<br>failure or airways of disease and i've<br>said that was a bit of a guessing game<br>but the addition here was the<br>measurement of<br>bnp and the blood sample taken as soon<br>as we could after the patient's<br>admission<br>and again just prior to their discharge<br>and there was one other test that was<br>added and that was a<br>measurement of cardiac performance using<br>a nuclear medicine<br>scan that couldn't be done on the day of<br>admission but often a day or two later<br>in the event we had 20 subjects that had<br>primary lung disease<br>12 that were thought to be heart failure<br>and 20 that had a mixed picture<br>both heart failure and lung disease how<br>did we determine that<br>well this was left to a parallel<br>specialist who adjudicated the diagnosis<br>after the fact in other words well after<br>the patient had been<br>disturbed from hospital and they would<br>have all the evidence that the<br>clinicians had<br>in addition they would have the<br>measurements of the x-ray<br>and the final outcome but they would<br>have no knowledge<br>of either the bnp level or the nuclear<br>med scan result<br>so in that respect it was an objective<br>study<br>well what were the findings we were<br>delighted to see<br>that as the left panel shows the<br>subjects with primary lung disease<br>did not have greatly elevated b and p<br>levels this<br>vertical scale here the y scale is a log<br>scale so<br>you're getting up here to enormously<br>high values just to give you perspective<br>the normal level of b and p is something<br>like five<br>pico moles per liter so the subjects<br>with hearts that are either pure and<br>simple<br>or mixed as it wasn't right here had<br>clearly elevated<br>levels compared to those with out a<br>heart failure component<br>a better way of examining that involves<br>a receiver operator curve<br>which basically looks at the ability of<br>one of these tests be it the amp<br>measurement<br>the bmp measurement or the scan<br>measurement to detect the signal<br>the signal here was an element of heart<br>failure<br>and the measurement is shown here are<br>the amp or bmp now let's<br>track down the bmp line this is data of<br>all 52 subjects thrown in<br>so if we travel down this curve we see<br>an inflection point<br>for the b and key which is corresponds<br>to<br>a 90 percent in that values that were<br>higher than that for the bnp level<br>in the securely breathless person uh<br>would represent heart failure in other<br>words<br>the stimul the signal here of heart<br>failure was detected in<br>90 of the time if the level was raised<br>the obverse of that is to define what is<br>the false positive from this<br>and at that very inflection point uh<br>there's ten percent of people that had a<br>high bnp<br>uh but did not have heart failure so<br>they were the false positives<br>so putting all that together uh we were<br>confident we'd come up<br>with a real advance here that in<br>subjects with severe breathlessness<br>the bmp level the essay is measured then<br>by radio immunosa<br>which took several days to measure by<br>the way<br>and that would assist in separating<br>subjects that truly<br>had a component of heart failure from<br>other causes of severe breathlessness<br>and if that was so it would open the<br>door and enable<br>much more effective focused treatment<br>well we published that in the lancet and<br>in no time we got correspondence to say<br>that's all very well but by the time you<br>got your b<br>p measurement the patient was either<br>dead<br>or they had discharged been discharged<br>from hospital<br>well and recovered that was fair comment<br>but technology came to our rescue and<br>within a few years<br>because of partly our paper and and the<br>recognition that bmp was registering<br>into cardiac pressure<br>and the new technology shows that<br>bnp could be measured in a simple<br>fingerprint test within<br>15 minutes so the patient admitted on<br>the emergency ward<br>could have that test available to the<br>doctor and they could decide<br>whether that was heart failure or<br>something else and that was formally<br>published<br>about eight years after our epic paper<br>in the lancet<br>and in 200 subjects<br>and using amino terminal pro bmp as well<br>as the<br>point of care assay that has been<br>alluded to<br>so i think we answered the question that<br>this was a very valuable test<br>there's one other thing that we found<br>from that study and that was that<br>if we looked at those subjects that had<br>responded well to treatment whether it<br>was from<br>airways treatments or treatment for<br>presumed heart failure<br>there was an important finding that<br>those that had the final diagnosis of an<br>element of<br>heart failure present that the level<br>fell from 82<br>to 36 a highly significant fall within<br>seven days uh there was no significant<br>fall<br>in the people that got the best<br>treatment for presumed obstructive<br>airways disease or<br>primary lung disease whatever it might<br>be that wasn't heart failure<br>um there was a small fall that could be<br>interesting to discuss but<br>this then tells us that bnp would be<br>likely<br>to reflect the efficiency of heart<br>failure treatment<br>and i think that opens the door to what<br>we'll heal further<br>uh later in terms of guided treatment<br>so we summarize our findings by saying<br>that<br>bmp essays um even today's mark has<br>alluded to<br>are officially recognized by the<br>american heart association<br>guidelines as a biomarker of choice for<br>the diagnosis of heart failure<br>that's a christchurch achievement<br>and since then there's been widespread<br>uptake of pleasant v<br>bmp essays thanks to tim yandle and the<br>group in cardio endocrinology<br>developing m e assays this has now been<br>added<br>to the traditional weaponry of imagery<br>and measurements of intracardia pressure<br>beloved by cardiologists i tell you it<br>took some time to convince cardiologists<br>that a simple blood test might also be<br>helpful<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
