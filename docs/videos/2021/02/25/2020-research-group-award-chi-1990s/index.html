point a fork stuck in<br>the<br>road time grabs you by the rest directs<br>you where to go<br>so make the best of this dance known as<br>why<br>it's not a question but a lesson learned<br>in time<br>that's something unpredictable but in<br>the end is<br>so take the photographs and still<br>friends in your mind<br>and get on a shelf in good health and<br>good time<br>tattoos and memories and dance get on<br>trial<br>but in the end is<br>that's something unpredictable but in<br>it's something unpredictable but in the<br>end is<br>so now we're going to hear talks from<br>two of the stars from that period<br>professor richard trouten a cardiologist<br>who specializes in cardiac imaging<br>and professor chris charles a<br>physiologist and expert in pre-clinical<br>models of heart disease<br>take it away richard please thanks<br>it's certainly a huge honor and<br>privilege to be part of this incredible<br>group<br>and one of the areas that the chi has<br>led in is the whole concept of biomarker<br>guided treatment particularly for heart<br>failure<br>and having it's a i think it's a real<br>example of the<br>brilliant basic science translating to<br>clinical utility<br>and having available a uh<br>an essay for anti-pro bmp which allowed<br>us to get insights into cardiac function<br>um was really the one of the back basis<br>for the rationale for the np guided<br>strategy<br>as has been pointed out and we've been<br>able to and others have shown that um<br>anti-probemp levels are related to<br>cardiac function<br>um loosely related to ejection fraction<br>but if you<br>look at carefully characterizing cardiac<br>function then we could show that in<br>heart failure patients about 80 percent<br>of antiprobemp<br>variability could be explained by<br>cardiac function<br>so as as<br>eric is uh showing very elegantly<br>antiprobe<br>also a validated diagnostic marker and<br>this is important<br>also the data he showed in terms of<br>response to therapy in that initial<br>cohort<br>um this was further data supported from<br>a large cohort that mark and john lynch<br>pre put together<br>forming the icon collaboration which was<br>part of the real validation of<br>anti-pro-bnp as a diagnostic marker<br>showing that you could rule out heart<br>failure with low levels but that higher<br>levels were indicative of acute heart<br>failure<br>which is important when you're guiding<br>patients because persisting high levels<br>could indicate<br>persistent congestion and risk for heart<br>failure<br>as well antiprobe bmp is a powerful<br>prognostic marker<br>mark had shown this in the in the mi<br>cohort<br>but an acute heart failure it's evident<br>that the change<br>that eric alluded to with treatment is<br>important so<br>if you look at changes in time over time<br>in terms of being p or anti pro b p<br>levels<br>patients whose levels fall had a much<br>superior outcome in terms of two-year<br>mortality<br>whereas those patients whose levels rose<br>or remained high<br>have very high levels of mortality at<br>two years so being able to<br>drive down into pro-bmp levels seemed to<br>be a good thing<br>and it turned out that most of the<br>proven therapies for<br>uh heart failure the ones that modified<br>outcome<br>actually produce a fallen antiprobe bmp<br>levels<br>this was elegantly described in this<br>paper led by<br>gary which shows that either short term<br>or long term<br>antiprobium p levels tend to fall if you<br>use proven therapies<br>the slight caveat was beta blocker<br>therapy which<br>in the in the first instance in the<br>early days or weeks<br>tends to cause a brief rise and this was<br>a study that mark davis and mark<br>richards led which showed that<br>for patients who were started on<br>metoprolol and proven heart failure<br>medication<br>by six weeks there was a near doubling<br>in the level of anti-probe bnp or bnp<br>but longer term levels fall and follow<br>beneficial remodeling<br>so that rationale led to a hypothesis<br>that was<br>generated by gary eric and mark and part<br>of the<br>the program application in the 90s<br>the hypothesis that heart failure<br>treatment could be guided by bnp<br>anti-pro bmp levels and if we could<br>drive down anti-probe np levels<br>that could improve outcomes so<br>uh the initial study that we evaluated<br>that that in was<br>performed in the late 90s we recruited<br>69 patients who had proven heart failure<br>and randomized them either to usual<br>clinical care using<br>usual clinical acumen and up titrating<br>medications according to clinical<br>criteria<br>or using an anti-pro-vnp target trying<br>to get patients below a target<br>so patients were seen regularly and this<br>involved gary sitting<br>in many clinics with me in a blinded<br>fashion he was blind to the patient<br>group but<br>he assisted patients clinically and then<br>i was unblinded and could up titrate for<br>the np group because i<br>knew the np levels and so we paid<br>followed patients and untitrated therapy<br>according to group<br>mark adjudicated all the clinical<br>outcomes and at the end of that we could<br>we<br>were able to demonstrate that using an<br>anti-pro bmp guided strategy<br>we could actually drive down the<br>anti-pro-bnp level so in the np group<br>levels were lower by the end of<br>follow-up<br>but more importantly we saw a much lower<br>event rate<br>in patients in the np-guided group so<br>much less patients were much less likely<br>to have a heart failure event to be<br>hospitalized or to die<br>during the first six months so that was<br>really<br>exciting pilot data and it led on to a<br>bigger study<br>the famously named battle scourge study<br>named by mark<br>and designed by mark and john and gary<br>and led by john lynch which went on to<br>look in a bigger cohort<br>at np guided care particularly comparing<br>intensive care with usual care<br>versus anti-probiotic bmp guided care<br>and also<br>looking at the effect effective age on<br>the effectiveness of the strategy<br>this again it received hrc funding and<br>heart foundation funding and essay<br>support from roche diagnostics<br>uh slightly more complex design and a<br>bigger study so 364 patients<br>randomized either to usual care and this<br>group actually we didn't see again<br>really they were seen in the community<br>or in the hospital clinics<br>or the intensive group which either had<br>usual intensively clinically guided<br>treatment<br>or anti-probium p-guided treatment and<br>we looked at events over two or three<br>years so much<br>larger study more complex but at the end<br>of it<br>the study demonstrated that in young<br>patients below the age of 75 there's a<br>substantial<br>survival benefit so this is all caused<br>mortality much lower in patients who<br>had an anti-pro-bmp guided strategy<br>compared to either clinically<br>guided care or the usual care in the<br>community above 75<br>their strategy doesn't seem to be<br>effective so our research really<br>generated a huge amount of interest<br>globally<br>and led to a large number of uh small<br>and moderate-sized studies performed<br>in europe and north america and<br>we had the privilege of being able to<br>lead a collaboration with<br>each of these groups and to combine the<br>data into an individual patient<br>meta-analysis<br>chris frampton worked some statistical<br>magic as he always does<br>and was able to help us analyse<br>all the individual patient data and what<br>that study showed amongst<br>um well over two two and a half thousand<br>patients<br>was that this np-guided strategy seemed<br>to be highly beneficial so<br>for all caused mortality and their 40<br>reduction in the hazards ratio but again<br>the benefits seem to be<br>uh largely in the the younger patient<br>group<br>and with no effect really overlapping uh<br>hazards uh<br>in the in the older group of patients<br>we could also demonstrate that there was<br>reduced hospitalization risk<br>for np guided therapy so as a<br>consequence of<br>this guidelines international guidelines<br>have included<br>monitoring of heart failure with or bnp<br>as a recommended strategy so<br>in summary chi has pioneered biomarker<br>guided treatment of heart failure<br>current guidelines now reflect that and<br>recommend anti-pro-bmp monitoring of<br>heart failure and cite our research and<br>our collaborations<br>and i haven't discussed it now but um<br>the imperative study has been a<br>follow-on<br>and in collaboration with our good<br>friend and collaborator rob doughty<br>we've been testing the strategy in acute<br>so i actually just uh squeezed into the<br>end of the 80s but we'll talk mainly<br>about um<br>some of the work that myself and miriam<br>did in the um<br>in the 90s and and tim has actually<br>already introduced this a little<br>um but and that is uh looking at uh<br>nep or nepalison inhibitors in<br>pre-clinical models or<br>or sheep studies basically paralleling<br>clinical studies<br>and before we do that so my very first<br>publication was what is the<br>physiological role of amp<br>and actually mark has already presented<br>studies that showed what it was when<br>they<br>took it themselves as volunteer humans<br>but we<br>did very similar studies in sheep too<br>sheep have advantages that you can do<br>some things that you<br>are not ethical to do in humans but you<br>can also potentially<br>for example in this study infuse for a<br>longer period 24 hours<br>or other studies we went longer and and<br>i won't dwell on this but but basically<br>this is very similar to results that<br>mark showed<br>show that subtle increments in an inp um<br>cause the expected and good reductions<br>and pressures<br>around the body and also an increased<br>natures and eric's also showed<br>and dwelled on on a version of this<br>study too at this<br>diagram too so i'm not going to dwell on<br>that but basically<br>we were able to show that sheep are good<br>models of human heart health and disease<br>amp and bmp are physically<br>physiologically relevant hormones that<br>contribute to the day-to-day control of<br>blood pressure and<br>salt and water balance and our<br>collaborative approach<br>physiologists working with in<br>partnership with clinician clinicians<br>biochemists assay and laboratory<br>scientists makes for world-class<br>research group with the ability to<br>so just just a wee sort of<br>digression heart failure there's<br>actually many many<br>hormonal systems which are activated in<br>in the setting of heart failure<br>and basically you can sum this up as as<br>the baddies<br>on the left the constrictors and the<br>goodies on the right the dilators<br>and in severe heart failure the baddies<br>outweigh<br>the effects of the the good systems<br>and gary has talked about<br>ace inhibitors the very first patient<br>that received one<br>so clinicians and scientists started<br>realizing that if you can<br>inhibit the effects of the bad hormone<br>systems<br>by giving drugs that inhibit those that<br>you show benefit and heart failure<br>so through the 80s 90s and 2000s<br>there were classes of drugs which<br>improved the<br>outcome well the living the daily living<br>conditions of patients without<br>heart failure but also mortality and you<br>can see<br>each time you introduce one of the new<br>classes of inhibitors<br>you improve annual mortality but after<br>the 2000s i wasn't quite sure<br>whether there would be the next big<br>class of drugs<br>so during the 90s we and others around<br>the world started wondering whether<br>we could promote the actions of the<br>naturoritic peptides in the body<br>mark's already shown this slide too so<br>won't dwell on it but it's<br>uh just introduced that we have a pacing<br>model of heart failure<br>and miriam is the person who heads up<br>those studies<br>but both uh myself in normal sheep<br>marim and heartfelt sheep and actually<br>mark<br>and normal humans and a range of<br>human patient cohorts we<br>spent a lot of time in particularly in<br>the early 90s<br>administering these nep or nepalese<br>inhibitors to either our animals<br>or patients or human volunteers so we<br>are blocking the<br>enzyme which cleaves inp<br>and and and activates it so a p will<br>hang around in the in the body for<br>longer to have<br>a beneficial effect<br>i'm not going to go in detail through<br>the studies but i'm going to show you<br>two<br>in the heart failed sheep<br>so if you give the nep inhibitors given<br>at this time point zero<br>and and infused for a three hour period<br>you can promote the circulating levels<br>of the natural<br>peptides you can show a good<br>array of hemodynamic or blood pressure<br>lowering and<br>heart improving actions and you can<br>promote the increase of<br>urine volume and urine sodium excretions<br>so you're having<br>things that benefit uh people or animals<br>in this case with heart failure<br>so one of the next studies that miriam<br>did was<br>she combined nep inhibition with the ace<br>inhibition<br>which was not by now stan that's the one<br>that gary talked about right at the<br>start<br>standard therapy if you add the nep<br>inhibition to it do you get added<br>benefit<br>over and above and uh i'm not going into<br>into detail but basically you do get an<br>additive over and above um improvements<br>in hemodynamics<br>and in the urine<br>output and sodium so smart<br>drug companies around the world started<br>to produce compounds that would<br>combine both ace inhibition and enep<br>inhibition<br>one of those compounds was omer petrolet<br>we did a sheep study with that here in<br>christchurch<br>we also did a human study with that in<br>christchurch as well<br>but then soon after 2002<br>a very a negative study actually using<br>this compound in a very large cohort of<br>uh nearly 6 000 patients actually showed<br>that that compound omepatrolat<br>had no benefit over ace inhibitors alone<br>and there are also clinical<br>so at that stage multiple pharma<br>companies pulled out of<br>nep inhibitor development and<br>we all wondered really was nep<br>inhibition destined for the big pharma<br>scrap peep<br>but 12 years later only six years ago<br>now<br>the paradigm started one company<br>persisted and the paradigm heart failure<br>study<br>had which had had been going for a<br>number of years was published in<br>the new england journal of medicine and<br>that was a combined<br>inhibitor of slightly different to the<br>ace inhibitors but still<br>inhibiting the angiotensin system and<br>nephrolysin inhibition<br>and although we didn't appear on the<br>orth list of of this<br>uh of this multinational study of the 28<br>references that were referenced in that<br>publication<br>two of them were our very own sheep<br>studies so<br>you know we we didn't get the final<br>glory but we contributed some<br>uh 15 years earlier to the science that<br>is the background to this<br>and in short not going into detail but<br>in that study there were 8<br>400 patients that were randomized heart<br>failure patients<br>to receive either an ace inhibitor alone<br>or the new compound and there was a 20<br>reduction in death and or<br>hospitalization<br>compared to the ace inhibitor alone this<br>compound received fast-track fda<br>approval<br>and intresto is now called and it was<br>the first change to heart failure<br>pharmaco therapy in over a decade<br>and so we're quite proud that chi<br>pre-clinical studies provide a key link<br>to the<br>translation of biodiscovery to new<br>treatments for cardiovascular disease<br>and not in the 90s but just looking<br>ahead a wee bit more<br>this is the nepalison that i talked<br>about before but that this is uh<br>above the line is on the outside of the<br>cells in our body<br>and below the line is what happens on<br>the inside of the cells<br>so once uh the natural peptides activate<br>their receptor they increase the cyclic<br>gmp<br>we've been looking well particularly<br>miriam and nick who has now joined the<br>team<br>switched over from the omics group about<br>five years ago at<br>uh uh inhibiting the degradation of<br>pde9 inhibitors and uh published<br>in a very prestigious journal about two<br>or three two years ago<br>showing that that is active and we just<br>got an email<br>just a couple of days ago to say coming<br>over from<br>being synthesized in australia is<br>osteocrine which is<br>is maybe the next big thing in this area<br>which we will be putting</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
