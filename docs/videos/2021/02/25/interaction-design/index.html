It’s one of the newest and fastest-growing fields of design. Hear what School of Design Innovation–Te Kura Hoahoa students Logan Kim, Alexandra Larkworthy, Gabrielle Pittar and Adam Ben-Dror say about the Bachelor of Design Innovation (BDI) in Interaction Design studies.<br><br>Study Interaction Design at Te Herenga Waka–Victoria University of Wellington: https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/explore/study-areas/design/study?subject=interaction-design<br><br>Video credit: Edgar Rodriguez-Ramirez</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>To me interaction design is all about the <br>communication between objects and people.  <br>So with every design concept you have <br>you can have objects talking to objects,  <br>people to objects, or people to people. <br>Whether it's like products or websites or <br>services interaction design is ultimately  <br>helping people so that those experiences <br>are the best that they possibly can be.<br>Interaction design kind of channels human <br>psychology towards design issues it's really just  <br>real-life problems and ways of solving them with <br>either tangible products or intangible services.<br>I define interaction design as kind of sitting <br>in between industrial and media design it draws  <br>on kind of all aspects of those papers. At the <br>base of all our designs, we find a pain point  <br>and then we target that. We're not just designing <br>a bit of furniture that you're going to sit on  <br>we might design a bit of furniture for someone <br>that has trouble getting up and down off their  <br>seat because they've got arthritis in their <br>hips or something like that. So we're looking  <br>at someone's personal problem or a large group <br>of people's problems and designing to fix that.<br>My favourite part about studying <br>interaction design at Vic  <br>is probably being able to work with a group <br>of people who are super like-minded and  <br>all kind of want what is best for <br>the people that we're designing for.<br>My favourite part of studying interaction design <br>at Vic has to be just the city, the city itself  <br>I love Wellington so much. I live two minutes <br>from campus it's a two-minute walk to get sushi  <br>on the break you know it's all really close. <br>I knew I wanted to study interaction design  <br>because it was looking at a <br>whole process it's not looking at  <br>you know a typical one point of like I'm gonna <br>design a couch or I'm gonna design a lamp. We're  <br>looking at the start and the end. We're looking <br>at how's that couch the experience of buying that  <br>couch and then when you buy the couch and then <br>that experience of getting that couch home and  <br>you're looking at the whole holistic approach of <br>it. It's not just a single point and it draws on  <br>all different aspects of design and I don't like <br>to kind of keep myself to one point I like to do  <br>video, I like to do photography, I like to design <br>physical objects, I like to do a little bit of  <br>website design and aesthetic design. So it kind <br>of just means I can kind of do everything I want.<br>As much as I'm not really like a <br>coder or a developer I don't really  <br>love the digital side of things all the time, I <br>think I like to step away from that when I can.  <br>But with interaction it means that I can <br>design products, I can design services,  <br>I can design apps, and they are all kind <br>of working towards the same common goal of  <br>just solving a problem. And that's really <br>gratifying to be able to do for someone<br>It's really undervalued <br>especially with the fact that  <br>interaction design in the workplace now is forming <br>a part of almost every major service business.<br>There's so many possible things that you <br>could do with interaction design whether it be  <br>being an in-house designer and helping companies <br>with certain aspects of user experience or  <br>web design and things like that.<br>My minor is in marketing and I've found <br>that there's actually a lot of parallels  <br>with social marketing and UX design, interaction <br>design, and video so I love video as well so all  <br>those three things combined. Social marketing is <br>essentially marketing for greater social goods so  <br>it would be kind of an agency like Clemenger <br>BBDO, for example, they do stuff with drunk  <br>driving campaigns and all that sort of stuff for <br>government agencies and that would be kind of like  <br>designing the problem, the strategy, the <br>implementation, like video and all that.<br>I really want to go out and try a few companies, <br>a few small companies, that are related to design  <br>and really see what the whole process is <br>like from the start to the end. You know  <br>what's it like running a company? I've always been <br>interested in having my own company in the future.<br>Just using my skills that I've got from <br>interaction to actually solve a problem  <br>and just make a change in someone's life <br>or a big group of people's lives and just  <br>design to make things better. And not <br>design for the sake of just making more  <br>crap if you don't mind me saying. And in the <br>end that just ends up getting thrown into  <br>the dump or it ends up getting thrown out and <br>you just keep adding to this consumerist society  <br>that we have. And we need to be designing to <br>get out of that so we have a better future<br>we know an MRI scan can be intimidating, <br>that's why we've designed our MRI scanner  <br>from the ground up to improve your MRI <br>experience without compromising image quality.  <br>Enabled by groundbreaking developments in MRI <br>methods and superconducting magnet technology.  <br>Our compact head imaging system allows <br>you to sit comfortably during the exam  <br>with your shoulders outside the scanner you <br>can look through a window in the side, you can  <br>control your own entry and exit we think it will <br>change how you experience MRI. Let's take a tour.<br>As people arrive for their appointments <br>the scanner is prepared for use.  <br>They sit down and the technologist <br>ensures the backrest is adjusted.  <br>Their remote control operates the chair. <br>The angle of the leg rest may be adjusted.  <br>And the chair then moved into position.  <br>It stops automatically when <br>their head is in the right place  <br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
