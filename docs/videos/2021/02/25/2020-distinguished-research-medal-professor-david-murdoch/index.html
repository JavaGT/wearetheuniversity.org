reki te mairaki pitama who<br>is my father-in-law who was our first<br>and that wayata takes us on a journey<br>from around the huramaka from around<br>banks peninsula<br>and starts from onoku and comes through<br>wairua to tomato<br>and through kokoda to out to<br>tuahiwee<br>and just acknowledged all of the<br>manufenua from this area<br>and in acknowledging the mana whenua<br>from this area<br>i also have the privilege of sharing<br>that water with david today<br>as the tumor there actually has really<br>contributed to the whole and well-being<br>of our people not just on the banks<br>peninsula<br>from but from further than that um and<br>i've just wanted to<br>uh acknowledge his work his uh<br>and his contribution to the field and<br>i'm sure we're all really excited to<br>hear about that but wanted to do it<br>by starting with the recognition to his<br>good afternoon everyone um my name is<br>harleen hayne and i have the great<br>privilege of being the vice chancellor<br>here at the university of otago<br>and it's my pleasure um to welcome you<br>to this um event in honor of the<br>distinguished research medal<br>i'd like to start first by thanking suze<br>for her beautiful mihi toe that<br>was absolutely wonderful way to start<br>our event today thank you very much<br>um now i know that this year has been<br>really difficult for<br>everyone and it's fantastic to see so<br>many people here today<br>to share in the celebration of professor<br>murdoch's<br>accomplishments i think it's really<br>important for all of us to just take a<br>moment<br>and acknowledge the fact that we are<br>here<br>because of the fruits of our collective<br>labor there are very very few places in<br>the world in fact<br>i can think of almost none where events<br>like this one<br>could be held right now so to each and<br>every one of you know my heart of mine<br>now this year as the vice chancellor i<br>have often reflected on the adage<br>when you are lost in a swamp you need a<br>compass<br>not a map now for most university<br>leaders<br>covet 19 has been the ultimate swamp<br>maker and all of our road maps and our<br>strategic plans<br>these things that we are accustomed to<br>using in leadership<br>have really gone out the window because<br>we are in an unfamiliar environment<br>where the rules keep changing but here<br>at otago<br>we are incredibly lucky because many of<br>our researchers<br>have provided the compass that the<br>university and the country so<br>desperately needed<br>they have allowed us to find our way out<br>of the swamp<br>the university of otago has not only<br>survived<br>the slings and arrows of covet 19 we<br>have actually thrived<br>and we've thrived because of outstanding<br>researchers like the one we are here to<br>honor today<br>now in a typical year the university<br>distinguished research medal is given to<br>an outstanding researcher<br>but as we know this year has been<br>anything but typical<br>and this year the award will be given to<br>someone who is not only an outstanding<br>researcher<br>but to someone whose expertise has also<br>helped to guide<br>a university and a nation in a situation<br>a disrupter that has been greater than<br>any that we've faced since world war ii<br>so on behalf of the university of otago<br>i would like to warmly congratulate<br>david<br>on his very very well earned honor today<br>as a research community i know that i<br>share<br>the sentiments of this audience by<br>saying we are incredibly proud of you<br>i will now hand over to professor blakey<br>who's going to tell us a bit<br>more about the distinguished research<br>medal and a bit more about professor<br>murdock's very very stellar research<br>career<br>namihinui koto no te nakoto tena koto<br>i'm richard blakey deputy vice<br>chancellor research and enterprise and<br>um it's my<br>pleasure and privilege to be here saying<br>a few words in introduction<br>to david and his award of the<br>distinguished research medal um<br>this is the university of otago's<br>highest award for distinction in<br>research<br>and it's been awarded for more than a<br>decade now and david will be joining<br>past recipients including pioneers<br>some of you some of whom you will be<br>familiar with and others not<br>people like christine winterbourne lisa<br>matsuzu smith<br>richie paulson and some of our our clear<br>research leaders it's award<br>awarded based on outstanding scholarly<br>advancement<br>which can include discovery and<br>dissemination of new knowledge<br>development of innovative technology<br>developing concepts that lead to other<br>significant advances<br>and in assessing this through the panel<br>that i convene<br>it's usually a very very hard job to<br>identify<br>uh elements that raise one person ahead<br>of others<br>in in that in that panel<br>we usually receive a large number of<br>very very deserving<br>nominations and in fact it is to<br>david's topic of aspects of leadership<br>that<br>often come through leadership and<br>partnership<br>that often come through as<br>distinguishing elements within<br>nominations<br>this is not simply a measure of<br>academic prowess although academic<br>prowess is<br>something that gets you into the into to<br>the discussion<br>it's what people do with their with<br>their<br>distinction and how they have advanced<br>through leadership and partnership<br>through career development that are some<br>of the elements that that differentiate<br>the awardee in any one year from others<br>and i have to say this year was a very<br>very difficult choice<br>and it was truly the breadth and depth<br>of your contributions david<br>not just to our national effort but<br>globally that made the difference<br>and in terms of the process people<br>should be aware that this was a<br>nomination and nominations were called<br>for this award<br>in march february march this year so<br>this is a nomination that was based on<br>david's contributions pre-covered and i<br>will outline some of those<br>what we have seen is that the panel uh<br>who made the recommendation to the vice<br>chancellor has<br>have had their recommendation endorsed<br>through the work that you have done<br>tirelessly<br>tirelessly with other colleagues since<br>the scale and the reach of the pandemic<br>have become clear globally<br>that you have been able to take some of<br>the immense and impressive work that<br>that we saw in the nomination and apply<br>that to a new area that again is a<br>distinguishing characteristic<br>uh we would hope of all of our of our<br>highest<br>achieving researchers just before i<br>introduce david in the lecture a few<br>words from his nomination<br>um i think one of the other<br>distinguishing characteristics that made<br>it um<br>that gave the panel some assurance was<br>that otago that otago is the place that<br>you graduated from<br>uh with your medical medical degree and<br>then went out into the world to all<br>kinds of other places but you were well<br>trained we knew that from the start<br>and that you have you have been uh since<br>about 2000 returned<br>here to christchurch and have<br>contributed very strongly<br>in roles of research of teaching and in<br>particular<br>in leadership your research leadership<br>and international activities<br>are some of the things that really stood<br>out to the panel most<br>well known internationally for your<br>research on respiratory infections<br>and an international leader leader in<br>pneumonia diagnostics<br>etiology and prevention uh you you<br>are one of the few people in the world<br>with clinical laboratory and<br>epidemiological expertise in adult and<br>childhood<br>pneumonia in both developing and<br>developed world<br>settings and amongst the many projects<br>uh one that stood out was your<br>involvement in leadership<br>in the perch pneumonia etiology research<br>for child health<br>program the world's largest pneumonia<br>study and a flagship of project of the<br>bill and melinda gates foundation<br>a 40 million project where you were<br>a laboratory director responsible for<br>overseeing all of the laboratory work at<br>each site<br>and in a central reference laboratory<br>and to be able to get that kind of<br>global global prominence and leadership<br>made your nomination amongst others very<br>very compelling david<br>so we're very very pleased that you are<br>the recipient this year<br>and looking to your title this is your<br>time well actually now this is your time<br>it is your time to share with us the<br>critical partnership of science and<br>leadership so please join me in<br>congratulating david and welcome him to<br>lecture<br>a big thank you for that introduction<br>and really thank you sues for the<br>wonderful welcome and the kind words um<br>helene and richard i was saying before<br>it's been a feels like<br>it's a bit like a wedding what's been<br>happening up until now today it's been<br>a little overwhelming and i think the<br>previous<br>recipients i'm sure would share with me<br>the the kind of<br>discomfort the fact that um you know<br>nobody gets to this point<br>uh without it being a team behind it so<br>to be the the focus<br>if it does feel a little uncomfortable<br>but<br>thank you all for coming and to see so<br>many<br>friends and family and colleagues and<br>people have come from out of town i mean<br>this is really<br>um a very very special event so thank<br>you very much<br>and this has been clearly pointed out<br>this has been a a really<br>unusual year for everybody and i can<br>tell you for an infectious disease<br>person and particularly somebody who's<br>interested in respiratory infections<br>it has been a really really unusual year<br>and this is your time actually came from<br>a conversation<br>i had earlier on the year with guyan<br>espina the the rnz journalist who<br>said to me david this really is your<br>time<br>and i thought that was a good title and<br>of course there's a nice link there of<br>course i don't know if eric is here<br>but yeah guyan is wonderful<br>um guyan of course is his father um<br>is an emeritus professor on this campus<br>and somebody who was a very important<br>figure when i was<br>but thinking about what i was going to<br>talk about today<br>obviously there's covert and we've<br>already mentioned this and i thought<br>well i can't get away without actually<br>mentioning covert<br>but i don't want to just talk about<br>covet i think everyone's going to be<br>very very tired of that<br>but are thinking about some of the<br>characteristics<br>that have really differentiated new<br>zealand's response from the rest of the<br>world<br>and we hear a lot about leadership and<br>about science and scientist<br>informed decision making and we've<br>certainly<br>seen that here in new zealand and it is<br>a difference a big difference from many<br>countries in the world so i thought that<br>was a<br>a good theme and it's something that<br>i've ended up focusing quite a bit on in<br>my career since i was<br>appointed a rather young age to be a<br>head of department in fact i've only<br>faculty positions i've only ever been a<br>head of department or a dean i don't<br>know what it's like to be an ordinary<br>academic<br>and so i've in a way been forced to<br>think a lot about<br>about leadership and i also had some<br>very clear writing instructions both<br>formal and<br>informal to talk about my career my<br>career<br>and getting to this stage so and i'm<br>thinking right i can do that<br>my career hasn't been particularly<br>linear it's gone in a number of<br>directions and so i thought<br>i would talk structured around some<br>some key elements i think in terms of<br>that partnership<br>with science and leadership the ability<br>to actually get<br>uh this the research into to change<br>things and in health we should always be<br>doing that we should always be doing<br>work that is somewhere on the impact<br>pathway<br>i think that's really really clear but<br>how we do that and how we make changes<br>of course<br>there are different ways and so these<br>are some of the areas incorporating<br>research<br>normalizing research and clinical<br>practice<br>challenging dogma we have a lot in<br>health and science<br>understanding the science policy<br>interface<br>scientists are often not really good at<br>understanding actually how do we get<br>those results to change policy<br>and the other way around a lot of policy<br>makers are often not so good at engaging<br>scientists but getting into that space<br>is really<br>important not being afraid to embrace<br>some<br>complexity we often hear well that's a<br>really important question but it's too<br>hard<br>and actually sometimes other ones we<br>just have to tackle and dealing with<br>uncertainty we just have to do it's<br>important<br>and looking to the future striving for<br>trans<br>disciplinarity and i'll explain that if<br>you don't know what i mean<br>by that shortly but that's looking to<br>the future and so i'm going to<br>tell some stories about each of these<br>and they actually<br>roughly go in some chronology through my<br>career<br>and the one at the bottom which really<br>should be at the top is is actually<br>being values driven doing the right<br>thing and i don't have a specific story<br>because it crosses everything and it's<br>just having those values of<br>integrity and honesty and addressing<br>inequalities and encouraging diversity<br>doing the right thing<br>and i need to do an acknowledgement<br>first before i get on to this and i<br>start<br>you struggle with these you struggle<br>with you know how do you thank everybody<br>you're going to show some photographs<br>and acknowledge people but they're<br>people you might forget<br>so with the help of pippa scott the<br>research fellow i work with who is much<br>better on r<br>coding than i am this is a network<br>diagram of my co-authors<br>and i thought i'm the blue one and these<br>are<br>and i think it looks a little bit like a<br>corona virus actually<br>and and this just shows the complexity<br>and it's not unusual<br>in my work to have lots of collaborators<br>but there are about 1500 i never added<br>up 1500 individuals there<br>and although they are named you can't<br>see them but this is my<br>acknowledgement slide so if you if<br>you've worked with me um you'll be there<br>so thank you very much it's been<br>a wonderful career and also it's not<br>just the co-authors there are plenty of<br>others who<br>really helped along the way<br>but i i thought before i get on to those<br>stories just to talk about<br>the beginnings and being an infectious<br>diseases person<br>why not start with your plunket book and<br>my my parents are here and they're both<br>teachers and meticulous in their<br>recordings<br>so here's my plunket book and as you can<br>see i don't<br>i don't regard myself as being<br>particularly old but look you know<br>measles chicken pox whooping cough mumps<br>all of them are now vaccine preventable<br>so children nowadays should not be<br>getting these infections and some of<br>them are major like measles major major<br>killer in the world<br>of children so that's changed in my<br>lifetime and we've<br>changed the focus infectious diseases<br>kind of goes in and out of fashion<br>people think they've solved the problem<br>and then something like covert happens<br>and so taking the eye off<br>we we really do need to focus on a lot<br>of the so-called non-communicable<br>diseases absolutely right<br>but when we take our eye off the ball<br>when it comes to infectious diseases<br>we often encounter problems i reassure<br>my parents i'm not going to go through<br>my childhood i'm going to jump now too<br>and i'm really glad to see brian dallow<br>here because<br>this is my my first paper my first<br>publication<br>i was a medical student and a big shout<br>out to the kansas medical research<br>foundation<br>i was one of your summer students<br>and that was between my fourth and fifth<br>year medical school<br>and i responded to a notice from brian<br>this project at the old christchurch<br>women's hospital i sat<br>for up to six hours a day writing<br>observing very prem babies<br>writing down every minute recordings<br>under the guise<br>that i was monitoring sleep patterns and<br>only brian<br>and the child's nurse knew i was<br>actually monitoring the handling and the<br>adverse effects of handling<br>and brian tells me this still gets cited<br>in fact it is it was cited last year<br>citations now i didn't become a<br>pediatrician but<br>interestingly i've dealt with a lot of<br>pediatric<br>disease in my career and as i'll<br>introduce shortly one of my<br>longest standing colleagues is a<br>pediatrician<br>the next major step in my research<br>apprenticeship was in a place<br>that was probably a little unusual<br>and it's in this place here so<br>then my wife and i we graduated from<br>medical school<br>we did a house surgeon years we did as<br>most of our colleagues did at that time<br>we traveled for a year or two around the<br>world<br>we came back we started our specialist<br>qualifications then there's a gp<br>myself an internal medicine and then we<br>had this opportunity we we couldn't turn<br>down<br>which was to take a complete break<br>and volunteer for a job for two years<br>in nepal in the mountains of nepal and<br>so this is the village of kundai<br>um that's a hospital at the back there<br>that's the the hillary hospital<br>it's built in 1966 and just to give you<br>a little<br>perspective on where it is this is<br>zooming back that's the location<br>in the himalaya of the village of about<br>350 people that's<br>um mount everest around the corner<br>behind the village itself is nearly 4<br>000 metres<br>and the view the other way is not bad<br>either that's looking south so<br>this was um the nearest road was seven<br>days walk away<br>we had an airstrip a little closer there<br>was no electricity<br>our contact with no radio apart from<br>shortwave radio<br>receiving we had a male runner that came<br>every two weeks if we were lucky it was<br>just heaven<br>and this is um this is where<br>we we worked for two years this is the<br>team<br>and this is with a few others this is<br>essentially the health worker team<br>health professional team for quite a<br>large geographic area<br>not so big in population but big in an<br>area<br>and this was an absolute privilege to be<br>part of<br>of this community and just to<br>acknowledge on the left to right of our<br>staff kami mingma and samji<br>where some of our staff mega kami on the<br>left subsequently trained as a doctor<br>and for the last 20 years or so has<br>actually been running that hospital<br>there's<br>no need to get volunteers from overseas<br>but this and and i don't have time to go<br>in into detail but<br>absolute privilege to be part of this<br>community and for<br>me and myself this has been something<br>that has really been a huge<br>change and it affected our lives every<br>day in terms of the experiences that we<br>gained from<br>from those two wonderful years and uh<br>we were kind of it we had to do we had<br>to deal with<br>everything that came our way we had to<br>rely a lot on each other<br>and our sherpa colleagues and um there<br>was a new meaning to making a house call<br>i mean this was the kind of territory<br>we had to walk and so we're in a pack a<br>lot we were frighteningly fit um<br>and we hadn't you know we had talking<br>about leadership our boss was somebody<br>uh you'll be familiar with so so ed<br>hillary was effectively our boss and<br>it's an interesting was an interesting<br>character really<br>well known as a great organizer somebody<br>who was obviously<br>mostly out of the country he was mainly<br>in auckland while we were there and left<br>us to our own devices<br>but he um he would we were always aware<br>that he would<br>um we would know about it if there's<br>something with particularly with the<br>budget<br>that we were he wasn't terribly happy<br>about um<br>and he also had an interesting<br>relationship with doctors and<br>he had some that were really really<br>close friends but then he was<br>he really knocked doctor entitlement and<br>now i kind of realized that was<br>something that was<br>probably fair enough in many cases but a<br>previous<br>um volunteer in the early 70s asked if<br>they could purchase a calculator to help<br>with the budget and<br>it begrudgingly agreed but then said our<br>next time we'll appoint a doctor who can<br>add<br>and um and then we were waiting our time<br>and actually we were i think pretty much<br>in their good books and then after we<br>got home we got a letter<br>and i don't know if you see it there but<br>it's basically commenting on our excess<br>luggage<br>and we've been there for two years as<br>volunteers we're taking a<br>we were over the limit and so i like the<br>sentence if you can read it which just<br>says<br>i can see it as a pretty pretty<br>anyway and um<br>this was a a place where i actually and<br>looking back i did a surprising amount<br>of<br>of research we had time on our hands it<br>was totally unsupervised<br>and uh a lot of it was actually related<br>to altitude this was a very high mount<br>and then we were seeing a lot of<br>altitude sickness<br>and in fact looking back this was<br>probably the project that i<br>um with the bigger project and it's<br>actually quite a nice little cohort<br>study which i<br>haven't looked at for a very long time<br>which was one of the first<br>to actually show there may be a link<br>with increased risk<br>of acute mountain sickness if you have<br>an infection um<br>interesting it's a sole author paper<br>which doesn't happen very often i think<br>lindy<br>wasn't didn't let me put her name for<br>some reason but anyway it was<br>and then there was um a project there's<br>you might not see it there's a hotel<br>there<br>it's called hotel everest viewers built<br>by a japanese company to<br>bring in tourists fly them directly up<br>to nearly 4 000 meters<br>unacclimatized had this fantastic view<br>of everest<br>and then try and cope with the altitude<br>and be shipped back the following day<br>and for some reason<br>they let me survey all the all the<br>clients and over 80<br>of them developed acute mouth and<br>sickness during that time<br>and we looked at measuring the amount of<br>oxygen in the blood<br>all of us in the in the hospital every<br>day we would measure with pulse oximetry<br>the amount of oxygen to show<br>that actually varied with the season<br>measures this curiosity<br>in the summer your oxygen levels were a<br>little higher with the barometric<br>pressure<br>we surveyed iodine deficiency which was<br>a major problem in the area<br>and in the 1960s a wonderful program<br>supplementing the area with iodized oil<br>injections and we showed that there was<br>persistence of that effect<br>and weirdly i reported on some strange<br>fingernail abnormalities and sherpas and<br>we had some case reports i was really<br>surprised looking back<br>over two year periods quite a number of<br>publications from that time period<br>but the most important thing i wrote at<br>that time was this letter<br>and i've given up long ago writing<br>letters to the editor but this is when<br>we got the british medical journal<br>we read it cover to cover we had time on<br>our hands<br>and i wrote this letter in response to<br>this editorial by this guy andrew<br>pollard<br>and he was a young british doctor who<br>had been on an expedition<br>to the himalaya encountered this<br>terrible situation of<br>somebody with avoidable mountain<br>sickness who died<br>and he came back quite unsensed and<br>wrote the set at all in the british<br>medical journal and i<br>felt the need to make a comment on it<br>but and it's actually not the comment or<br>the content that was important<br>in terms of this letter it was actually<br>what happened next<br>because a few months later i guess by<br>the time the mail runner had come a few<br>times<br>we i got a letter from this guy simon<br>curran<br>it's a more recent photograph of simon<br>but he he wrote to me and says<br>you probably don't remember me i was the<br>the<br>sho who in 1999 when you're a cardiology<br>registrar<br>the palm who broke his ankles<br>parapontine off mount cook one christmas<br>so<br>when you're on the cute you know cute<br>service at a hospital<br>at a major hospital over christmas the<br>house season you're working with is on<br>crutches because he's done both his<br>ankles<br>you kind of remember him and but anyway<br>simon writing says<br>you know we're putting together several<br>expedition i'm the leader the person<br>andrew pollard the author of the<br>editorial is the deputy leader would you<br>like to join and of course they said yes<br>at that time<br>subsequently i pulled out with um<br>for a variety of reasons including<br>having a family but<br>at that time i was very keen to be part<br>of this so<br>as it happened the following year when<br>we left kundi<br>i went to for three months to liverpool<br>to do a diploma in tropical medicine<br>and at that time the planning for that<br>expedition was still going ahead<br>and there was a meeting in oldham one<br>weekend<br>near manchester i went across and that's<br>where<br>i met andy for the first time and um<br>this is obviously a more recent<br>photograph but then it was<br>we are incredibly similar in<br>the way we our work habits our interests<br>and it was very much a meeting of the<br>minds on first<br>the first time we met in fact he dropped<br>me home that evening the day we met<br>he was working in birmingham at the time<br>dropped me off in liverpool on the way<br>and in that time we had decided to write<br>a book together<br>having only met that day to write a book<br>that was an accessible book for health<br>care professionals on acute on mountain<br>medicine<br>altitude sickness something between<br>inaccessible textbooks<br>and the sort of guide books that people<br>have and we did we actually wrote the<br>high altitude medicine handbook this is<br>my first encounter with<br>publishing colonialism because it was a<br>british publisher<br>radcliffe medical press and our<br>authorship was in alphabetical order for<br>a start i don't think we'd actually<br>thought about it<br>we'd equally contributed but they said<br>we'd like the british author fest<br>so it's become pollard and murdoch and<br>it went to three editions it had a<br>pocket edition<br>translated twice into two different<br>german editions<br>and the real badge of honor the pirated<br>indian version<br>which and that one would you believe<br>sells on amazon so if you hear amazon<br>going on about their anti-piracy well<br>don't believe them they<br>sell it on amazon but anyway and<br>for andy and i this was really only a<br>bit of an interest<br>but we did a little more over the years<br>and in fact<br>this is one this is some work i did<br>returning to new zealand<br>with a friend chris curry who's an<br>emergency physician here at christchurch<br>hospital we did<br>the first report of cute mountain<br>sequence in the southern alps and i like<br>this because<br>i hand drew that that diagram<br>and just say we're both kind of retired<br>from altitude but we<br>altitude research and interest but we've<br>we still<br>have uh i think our name is still on the<br>relevant chapter in the oxford textbook<br>of medicine but my other badge of honor<br>was getting in there my photograph in<br>there and this was in<br>uh climbing kilimanjaro in 2006 and john<br>crump and i<br>and uh in the middle halfway up i had<br>terrible acute mountain sickness<br>and i said to john please take a<br>photograph of me we're so hard to get<br>good photographs of people to keep<br>out in sickness and so there i'm looking<br>really really pathetic i felt<br>terribly ill much better the following<br>day but anyway there you go<br>and and just to kind of continue we both<br>andy and i both<br>moved from the altitude work but both<br>converged and infectious diseases so<br>they actually go to the present time<br>andy now has moved in pediatric<br>infectious diseases vaccinology he heads<br>the oxford vaccine group<br>he's the he leads the uk's uh committee<br>on vaccines and is the lead investigator<br>on the<br>covert vaccine trial let's go on the<br>only way at the moment<br>and i'll come back to andy later on but<br>to the um<br>back to leadership and i think the uh<br>the idea<br>of incorporating research into practice<br>into clinical practice is something that<br>is<br>i think really really critical and<br>invaluable it's both to keep it relevant<br>but also<br>uh as an efficient way of um of getting<br>of making change and when i returned<br>after<br>uh been in the pile continue my training<br>and infectious diseases<br>and i went to this place canterbury<br>health laboratories over the road<br>i intended to spend a year there<br>training in microbiology and ended up<br>staying several years and<br>finishing the full training as a<br>clinical microbiologist<br>and this is an absolute gem amongst us<br>this place and i didn't know it until i<br>went away<br>this lab is is by far the best lab that<br>i<br>among all the labs i've worked in around<br>the world the level of expertise<br>from that place absolutely fantastic<br>place to train and it's the midlab<br>scientists there<br>are the ones that taught me all my<br>microbiology and i really<br>am so grateful for that group of of<br>of scientists and and one that has a<br>real research ethos which you can't find<br>in many places<br>research is a normal part of what they<br>do to<br>to keep sharp to keep it um and to keep<br>relevant<br>and just to do be doing the right thing<br>and i do need to name a few people here<br>and it's great to see lance in the<br>audience today come down from nelson<br>and uh lance was uh i mean<br>amazing in terms of intro setting up the<br>clinical virology there and introducing<br>the science trevor anderson<br>an amazing scientific officer<br>technically among the the best i've ever<br>worked with<br>who we have worked together for a very<br>long time anja verna on the top right<br>top left who is one of my trainees<br>and my i was supervised to phd she's now<br>my boss is the<br>uh as the chief of pathology for the<br>district health board<br>and uh kirsten bain and we started<br>working together with her first job as a<br>med lab scientist<br>she's now the general manager of labs<br>for canada district health board and<br>people who<br>understand research and the importance<br>of it as part of routine clinical<br>practice not something that just<br>academics do<br>and then i arrive back into this great<br>interest in<br>pneumonia and again great to see ian<br>here<br>and and i think i was there on your<br>first day when you started as a<br>physician in christchurch in 1990 and<br>was still working together<br>on covert vaccines so a really long<br>journey together but ian and lance<br>and steve chambers is steve here yes<br>great steve long-standing mentor<br>person who really is the father figure<br>for infectious kind of<br>affects these research in new zealand i<br>mean these guys have really<br>set up this whole body of work around<br>pneumonia i just walked into it<br>but that led to my interest in<br>respiratory infections come into this<br>environment<br>training lots of data lots of samples<br>just to do<br>lots of different projects related to to<br>pneumonia and just to<br>really touch on some of the things you<br>know at that time identifying that<br>legionnaire's disease was common<br>in in christchurch in the new zealand<br>that came from really that work and<br>legionnaire's disease is a type of<br>pneumonia caused by a specific bacterial<br>legionella<br>that was first really discovered at that<br>time<br>this kerb 65 score it's a scoring system<br>used all around the world<br>to assess patients with pneumonia and<br>decide on the treatment that was<br>partly with information from<br>christchurch a whole lot of work on<br>different diagnostic tests for the cause<br>of pneumonia<br>research showing that viruses were<br>really important cause of<br>pneumonia in adults as well as children<br>these are just some of the<br>the critical work that was undertaken<br>here and continued<br>and um but i went i need to go to<br>finishing school and this was kind of<br>when i went to that we went to the us<br>and then i<br>and our daughters had a fabulous two<br>years<br>uh to complete our training in uh in the<br>us<br>and i was at um in north carolina at<br>duke university and uh<br>three on the left with magnus from<br>iceland and debbie from<br>from new york we were we ran the the<br>infectious service for a year<br>at duke and this was a place um<br>i've never been in a place that really<br>would bring out the best in people<br>so much a place where actually if you<br>did a good job people told you honestly<br>something new zealanders are so bad at<br>and<br>it's no wonder new zealanders thrive in<br>the us with a well-resourced<br>and that sort of environment and we just<br>had an absolutely wonderful time<br>and i have to briefly mention<br>endocarditis i'm not going to go into<br>about<br>endocarditis which i had a brief foray<br>into that area and endocarditis are<br>heart valve infections<br>of which duke university is is renowned<br>for they're the whole criteria for<br>diagnosing this<br>infection to do criteria and there's a<br>service there which<br>i was part of at the time and they were<br>setting up a collaboration<br>an international collaboration of over<br>40 countries<br>to look at a cohort study on<br>endocarditis<br>and when i came back to new zealand we<br>started a new zealand<br>site here and this i put it here because<br>it's my most well-cited paper it's well<br>over a thousand times<br>but this was the other point is that<br>this project in which there are many<br>many publications had no specific<br>funding<br>at all it was all in-kind support from a<br>group around the world and over 40<br>countries who just thought this was<br>just something that should be done and<br>it really it just shows us obviously for<br>observational studies that's a bit<br>easier than intervention studies but it<br>shows you what<br>be possible by integrating research with<br>normal clinical practice<br>my second year at duke was working with<br>this man here barthralla and this is a<br>the journal of clinical microbiology<br>their first time they featured<br>this the section was for bath it was an<br>absolute giant and microphone not in<br>stature a very short man but he had<br>a giant in clinical microbiology and<br>someone who was absolutely fastidious<br>about<br>making sure that everything had an<br>evidence based challenge dogma<br>don't do tests unless they were really<br>relevant and<br>he said to me um he knew my interest in<br>the parliament said<br>if you find a project i'll fund it we'll<br>find some funding for it<br>and so i thought well that's that's a<br>good offer so i went and<br>spoke to a an old colleague buddha<br>baznet buddha is a<br>physician based in kathmandu trained in<br>india in canada<br>the most amazing networker i know of<br>around the world of<br>among fantastic facilitator probably the<br>most published medical researcher in<br>nepal<br>and he i said but this is you know this<br>is the opportunity he said look we<br>really need to<br>look at uh partner hospital on the main<br>general hospitals in kathmandu and have<br>a chat<br>to the uh the medical director who<br>introduced me to mark zimmerman and he's<br>an american who's lived<br>all his career really in nepal and still<br>there<br>and he was the medical director and he<br>said okay um<br>give us a couple of days and he came<br>back and said look we<br>we we don't have we don't have tropical<br>medicine here we we have<br>we what we see is medicine from the time<br>of osla and if you know osler was the<br>north<br>american physician from the<br>mainly in the 19th century late 19th<br>century wrote this textbook by himself<br>if you ever read its amazing textbook<br>and known to be a fantastic clinician<br>and what he was saying is<br>the kind of diseases that were prevalent<br>in north america and kind of victorian<br>times and<br>and um they said we need if we need a<br>fever study we need to know we don't<br>know what<br>are the causes of infection we don't<br>have do a lot of diagnostic testing and<br>so we<br>with support from the u.s centers for<br>disease control about a hundred thousand<br>dollars i think<br>we set up this project just to really<br>look at adults with pneumonia it's very<br>simple<br>people come in with a fever not with<br>pneumonia with fever<br>we would do some diagnostic tests on<br>them all that weren't<br>available normally blood cultures and a<br>few other tests<br>record some information pretty basic<br>stuff and here's bath<br>pretending to be a blood culture machine<br>he's basically a box of blood<br>of blood cultures which normally it's<br>automated and they rock so he's deciding<br>to<br>to rock them to help them grow but um<br>it's it was a very simple study and and<br>the results<br>probably can't see that actually but<br>that's a log book the lab log<br>book and it shows a lot of typhoid thai<br>food's caused typically by salmonella<br>typhi and para typhi and this is<br>extraordinary there are almost every<br>third or fourth line it's is salmonella<br>typhi and this was<br>really demonstrated what they kind of<br>already knew that typhoid<br>was very very common in the city we also<br>showed that<br>typhus which is a different disease<br>caused by bacterium that's very common<br>in<br>urban environments like here in<br>kathmandu and it<br>which is normally transmitted between<br>rodents and it's transmitted to humans<br>by fleas<br>we found that that was actually quite<br>important which was really not we didn't<br>there was no information on that<br>show leptospirosis so really just<br>showing some some fundamentals<br>and in fact if you go remember mark zuma<br>about the time of osula well look at the<br>at the chapter typhoid typhus number one<br>and number two so he was absolutely spot<br>on<br>and this study although it's very simple<br>has left quite a legacy in the country<br>it's not still known as the fever study<br>the adult fever study<br>and has been a springboard for a lot of<br>fairly basic research<br>to inform some of the treatment<br>practices<br>and just to briefly mention i have to<br>mention john crump john<br>based in dunedin and i have known each<br>other for for a long time and<br>he um had been set up a wonderful<br>collaboration<br>in myanmar and he asked me to be part of<br>that and<br>did a very very similar uh sort of<br>project and again typhoid was a fairly<br>um fairly common um diagnosis<br>in that environment as well but just to<br>to mention some of the incredible people<br>that we've<br>involved with uh in the middle and the<br>green<br>is this professor of microbiology<br>absolutely outstanding woman trained<br>phd in london gone through the whole the<br>different<br>regimes in myanmar and when it was<br>opening up<br>really encouraging uh people to come and<br>um<br>overseas collaborators to really return<br>to what they<br>they used to do they're very proud of<br>their research and education in the past<br>and trying to get back there and really<br>acknowledge also<br>uh dr tinder nong from from the<br>department of microbiology<br>who really was very keen facilitating um<br>that collaboration i'll just quickly go<br>next story challenging dogma which i i<br>love doing um<br>and you know i like this quote um the<br>true to me science is a substitution of<br>thought<br>reflection and curiosity with dogma and<br>here i need to introduce this team here<br>the infection group and this is really<br>the team that<br>when i came back to christchurch steve<br>and i were<br>working together and after a while we<br>needed more structure in our group and<br>we formed the infection group<br>i was partly around work on vitamin d<br>and i'm not going into that that was a<br>weird wacky world<br>of vitamins but what we<br>main focuses around around pneumonia<br>work and really just to acknowledge<br>some people sandy slow uh pippa scott<br>amy scott thomas and here we've got<br>three of our phd students bruce<br>zee wa and and hyun trish priest in<br>dunedin who's been a<br>absolutely vital member of our group and<br>somebody who is<br>doing enormous things for the country at<br>the moment with the covert response<br>jonathan williams mike mays and tony<br>walls and<br>um the story i wanted one to really talk<br>to you about is the legionnaires disease<br>story this is the touch on that there's<br>about challenging dogma and i mentioned<br>before about how<br>we discovered that legionnaires disease<br>was common in new zealand<br>as you may know this was first described<br>in 1976<br>around this outbreak in philadelphia it<br>was an<br>american legion legionnaires conference<br>and it was a major outbreak there was a<br>real concern was the swine flu was<br>this unknown infection and it turned out<br>to be this bacteria now knows legionella<br>causing<br>this outbreak of pneumonia and that's<br>really the picture most people in the<br>world<br>have of it causing outbreaks<br>of particularly in people in a<br>vulnerable population<br>often linked to water and these are the<br>water sources found in spa<br>pools air conditioning units and this<br>was re this is the the kind of picture<br>from that very first<br>outbreak and is what most of the world<br>thinks about with legionnaires<br>disease well when we started looking<br>into it<br>we found it was common here we still<br>found we were missing many cases<br>and the clinicians were worried about<br>missing cases and people ended up in icu<br>because they didn't get on to the right<br>treatment<br>and in the lab we were concerned about<br>how we were we're actually diagnosing<br>them and the problem is you need<br>specific tests<br>to diagnose you need to order them you<br>need to think about it and think well<br>does this person have legionnaire's<br>disease<br>and it's just very difficult to do that<br>there are no very few clues so it's a<br>little bit random<br>how that was being done and the<br>clinicians in the lab got together so<br>we need to do better why don't we just<br>literally test anyone who's admitted<br>hospital with pneumonia who produces a<br>spirum sample<br>whether it's ordered or not we'll just<br>do it and we'll see<br>overnight we increased the diagnosis by<br>about four fold and what<br>happened is we this graph here shows<br>that<br>the two years before the intervention<br>which was a smart way of<br>using the diagnostic testing and the two<br>years afterwards<br>and four-fold increase very clearly<br>delineating these seasonal peaks every<br>spring and summer much more predictable<br>than<br>than influenza and throughout two-thirds<br>of the cases were due to this bacterium<br>called<br>the species legionnaire long beachy<br>which was different from the one that<br>caused the original outbreak in<br>philadelphia at least now<br>pneumophila and the interesting thing<br>about this species<br>is the one associated with soil and<br>gardening and we all know that um<br>and there's rather than water we all<br>know that story now and so<br>this is quite a different picture in new<br>zealand<br>and we were able to show that yes it was<br>related these use of these<br>these compost related products also<br>showed that if it was if you didn't wash<br>your hands<br>after being in the garden that was also<br>a risk factor<br>and we were faced with a situation where<br>we had this sort of global view<br>of the disease that it was uncommon that<br>was due to outbreaks associated with<br>water<br>no seasonality or maybe sometimes in<br>summer so the very different picture<br>here we<br>saw virtually no outbreaks it was common<br>it was often associated with gardening<br>and it had this very marked seasonality<br>and everyone in<br>new zealand thought well this is just a<br>christchurch thing you know that's for<br>years we got there this is just a<br>christchurch thing we always say well<br>you're just not looking for it<br>you're not look find it because you're<br>not looking for it and so we actually<br>we called their bluff and um<br>we with some support from the health<br>research council we basically rolled out<br>canterbury's testing regimen<br>to the whole country for a year and<br>and what it showed just to quickly<br>summarize it basically showed that<br>actually<br>the ins the places that had very rarely<br>diagnosed legionnaires these were<br>diagnosed in it<br>it was just as common pretty much<br>everywhere and in fact hawke's bay<br>took our crown they have the highest<br>incidence in fact in the world it's<br>reported instance because of course most<br>of the world don't actually test for it<br>so we've convinced the rest of new<br>zealand it's a new zealand thing<br>but we haven't yet convinced the world<br>that actually<br>they're just not looking for it and the<br>pattern is quite different and i<br>i populate this map every time i see a<br>country that's detected legionnaire long<br>beachy<br>in an environment or in a human sample<br>and it's getting bigger and bigger and<br>it's very very hard to believe<br>that this is just in new zealand and<br>australian phenomenon about the<br>gardening and in fact in sweden<br>and in scotland recently i've had quite<br>major outbreaks rather clusters<br>associated with gardening so i think<br>we're going to be proven right at some<br>stage<br>and just i thought of this to show show<br>the leaders of this university what<br>professor chambers actually does<br>during his work time and this is a true<br>bucket chemistry<br>uh with a phd student and a mound of<br>compost and at a facility so this is<br>steve's leading a wonderful bit of work<br>looking working with industry<br>to try and solve this issue about how we<br>can make compost<br>safe and so that's that's some ongoing<br>work<br>understanding the science policy<br>interface and i um<br>now this is really critical as<br>scientists we often<br>think we've got produced some good<br>results that should result in change but<br>we're actually<br>often quite poor at how we translate or<br>understanding<br>what policy makers need and vice versa<br>sometimes the policy makers don't always<br>engage with the scientists well and the<br>story i'm going to tell goes back to<br>nepal<br>when we did our fever study i was<br>approached by these these two people at<br>the front<br>on the right is is nila matakari who is<br>the<br>head of pediatrics wonderful wonderful<br>pediatrician at partner hospital and<br>steve thorson on the left to another<br>american who for his life<br>had been working at partner hospital<br>another pediatrician and they basically<br>said<br>this isn't fair you need to study kids<br>we've got some issues as well<br>and can you please can we please look at<br>some some research<br>looking at some of the infectious<br>diseases and children and not being a<br>pediatrician i thought we needed some<br>help so that's when i brought<br>contacted andy pollock and said andy you<br>know this is something we we should<br>really look at<br>and it led to quite a program of work<br>and i do need to just put another pose a<br>moment<br>neelam uh in the middle who it was<br>really the<br>her and her husband were the the power<br>couple of pediatrics and<br>and in nepal and she's originally from<br>india she married in nepali<br>and for her career really made a huge<br>difference<br>to child health and she passed away a<br>few weeks ago so very sadly i thought i<br>just<br>needed that i always said she looks so<br>short there i always think of her as<br>this amazing woman with<br>incredible mana all the junior doctors<br>called her mam<br>at the time and she was really an<br>absolutely<br>impressive woman and eventually the<br>rector of the university<br>and also mentioned uh these are two<br>pediatricians we've worked with for a<br>while and particularly<br>on the left shujana shrestha worked with<br>her since she was quite a junior<br>pediatrician<br>she became head of pediatrics and now<br>the dean of the medical school so we<br>compare notes fairly frequently and in<br>fact<br>the only piece of work we haven't done<br>is the response to earthquakes<br>i was in in kathmandu in 2015 with the<br>earthquakes then we were meaning to<br>write a piece comparing the response of<br>the two medical schools<br>to earthquakes we probably won't get<br>there i think at this stage but we<br>certainly talked about it a lot<br>again amazing supporter of research and<br>the area i just want to focus on about<br>the the science policy interface is<br>about<br>the introduction of a vaccine against<br>pneumonia<br>and pneumonia is the big single biggest<br>killer of children in the world<br>a major cause is a bacterium called<br>streptococcus pneumoniae or pneumococcus<br>and there's an effective vaccine and so<br>getting that vaccine<br>has been absolutely critical getting<br>into many places in the world<br>and so that was really the the project<br>one of our main projects was to provide<br>the supporting evidence and all the<br>information that's needed to get that<br>implemented<br>and this is a generic slide it shows<br>what would normally happen to get a<br>vaccine<br>and this is quite different from covert<br>i might say where every country in the<br>world wants it now<br>you usually have to go through a process<br>of convincing governments and ministries<br>that this<br>is worth investing in that this is a<br>priority<br>and so a lot of our work to cut it short<br>was going through<br>engaging with all the relevant<br>stakeholders working with the ministry<br>of health and nepal working with<br>the world health organization working<br>with local societies getting the<br>information the burden of disease<br>showing that the strains<br>that were around in the power were those<br>that were covered by the vaccine<br>working out vaccine schedules that will<br>fit in with with their program<br>leading to implementation and just to<br>mention some of the organizations we<br>worked with and<br>it was it was one we actually had<br>ministry people<br>presenting our data they were part of<br>our study we were involved right from<br>the beginning<br>they were regarded themselves as<br>investigators<br>and there they were at meetings at<br>scientific meetings presenting the data<br>that we had produced together and with<br>the world health organization people<br>and in 2014 the vaccine was implemented<br>i think this whole<br>process is one of the sort of proudest<br>things that i've been involved with<br>and really something that will affect<br>many many lives<br>in in and we're now funded by the gavi<br>alliance to actually<br>measure impact is how the vaccines<br>actually have an impact<br>in the country and i love this<br>photograph<br>it's it's wonderfully colorful um but it<br>shows the whole team and if you look<br>there there<br>all of the group of of of people from<br>putin hospital partner academy of health<br>sciences there's a<br>all collaborators from around the world<br>they're people from the ministry there's<br>people from unicef from the world health<br>organization<br>a former fellow of ours who now is the<br>lead<br>wha person in kathmandu and then this<br>whole cadre of<br>clinical research fellows who have been<br>trained in conducting relevant clinical<br>next story embracing complexity and<br>as i say we often will decide that<br>something's a bit too hard<br>despite it might be a really important<br>topic and<br>it's really about not being afraid to<br>embrace complexity<br>and i need to introduce a couple of<br>amazing people kate o'brien on the left<br>canadian pediatrician vaccinologist<br>oran levine on the right an<br>epidemiologist<br>vaccinologist kate's now the head of<br>vaccines for who<br>owens the director of vaccine delivery<br>for the bill and melinda gates<br>foundation<br>when i first knew them there are<br>associate professors at johns hopkins<br>school of public health<br>and they asked me to be part of the<br>project that um<br>richard mentioned before the perch<br>project<br>um they asked me a part of a project<br>looking at childhood pneumonia and the<br>the issue being as i alluded to<br>pneumonia is the biggest killer of under<br>fives in the world<br>and with the introduction of vaccines<br>with some changes in<br>urbanization antimicrobial resistance<br>there was a real need<br>to get a contemporary picture of the<br>actual causes of pneumonia in developing<br>countries<br>in children so this is you know which<br>bacteria which viruses are now important<br>to guide<br>future efforts uh research efforts and<br>the melinda gates foundation came to<br>kate nora isn't that amazing<br>came and said we want to study and<br>put together team oren was the initial<br>principal investigator before he went to<br>the gates foundation and then kate took<br>over<br>and the acronyms of the pneumonia<br>etiology research for child health<br>program and for those interested it was<br>a<br>case control study two year study period<br>seven sites uh around the world in<br>sub-saharan africa and asia<br>looking at children with severe<br>pneumonia or controls<br>really trying to understand<br>the causes of pneumonia and i say this<br>is a complex<br>difficult task because pneumonia is<br>really difficult to define the causes of<br>pneumonia is a real real challenge<br>so this required use of fairly<br>innovative diagnostics<br>developing a totally new statistical<br>model of how we actually determined the<br>causes of pneumonia it was a really it's<br>a really really<br>challenging problem these are the sites<br>and in fact the numbers we<br>enrolled nearly 10 000 children over the<br>the study period<br>let's say five countries in africa and<br>and two in asia<br>and to give you the idea of the<br>complexity these are all the the<br>organizations so you can see otago's<br>there in canterbury health laboratories<br>and i should say that canterbury health<br>laboratories was the reference lab i<br>mentioned that what a gem it is that was<br>a reference there and very few labs in<br>the world will have the expertise in<br>pneumonia research to do that sort of<br>work that was done here in christchurch<br>and i reflected about six years ago i<br>gave a talk to my old department at a<br>annual seminar about the complexities of<br>how to manage a complex<br>um large complex multinationals<br>multi-national study<br>and so these are the headings i used at<br>the time assemble a good team<br>make time to plan properly learn to run<br>efficient conference calls i think we're<br>all really good at that now<br>develop reasonable expectations and<br>management that includes the funders i<br>had to run around a few times on a<br>monday for<br>bill gates wanting data and there is no<br>the idea of this sometimes we just<br>absolutely need to be there<br>to make things happen sure good data<br>management and mix and<br>some fun with the hard work and uh<br>you don't even see all the names but<br>just to give you a sense of scale this<br>is the<br>the core team the leadership team at the<br>top<br>this fantastic group of coordinators a<br>lot of<br>expertise from around the world that<br>have input at different stages<br>the teams of each of the sites this is a<br>fraction of the people that were<br>involved at each of the study sites<br>and in terms of you know preparation i<br>always tell<br>students and young researchers put more<br>time than you think into the preparation<br>stage<br>i love this quote from abraham lincoln<br>and we<br>we had the luxury it was a well-funded<br>study to actually<br>hand-pick people from from around the<br>world and get them into a room and say<br>can you help us design this and we got<br>them back several times<br>the preparation with interpreting x-rays<br>this is in the gambia some lab<br>workshops that i ran um we spent two<br>years preparing<br>even though i'm really enjoying not<br>traveling much at the moment there's a<br>period of time we just had to and one of<br>the study coordinates and i traveled<br>more than anyone else to all the sites<br>in the study and then we did mix in the<br>fun that we had meetings in all sorts of<br>places this was<br>a conference in israel that we went to<br>jerusalem with a<br>study meeting afterwards and and in fact<br>i think<br>we we so often engineer study uh<br>research groups<br>and people will try to but actually the<br>most effective ones are people who work<br>with each other because they enjoy each<br>other and the friends and<br>this is very much what happened here<br>very close<br>group of friends who it was a rather<br>unusual time<br>meeting in all sorts of places around<br>the world doing really important work<br>but having time<br>to get to know each other enjoy each<br>other's company<br>and we did get some results i mean this<br>after all of that we were able to<br>get an idea of the the causes of<br>pneumonia<br>um showing that viruses as we expected<br>were really<br>important in this group and particularly<br>a virus called respiratory sensitive<br>virus<br>but then there were others and it varied<br>by the region uh we're able we developed<br>these very complex new statistical<br>models which we think will be applied to<br>many other situations to help<br>deal with that and there are many other<br>projects but this is<br>some fundamental um data that will now<br>be used to guide a lot of the efforts<br>around the world<br>um and then for future research and<br>certainly if you're an rsv researcher<br>this was a real shot in the arm<br>and the new zealand involvement new<br>zealanders do we<br>we're disproportionately in lots of<br>studies around the world and it wasn't<br>just me in canterbury health<br>laboratories<br>the pi in the gambia was the new zealand<br>pediatrician steve howey<br>susan morpeth is now microbiologist and<br>and at middlemore she ran the lab in<br>kenya we had a phd student<br>um nick fan court uh and then john crump<br>and daniel was on our expert<br>advisory group so we were way<br>overrepresented in the study my last<br>story<br>is about looking toward the future and<br>um striving for as i say<br>trans-disciplinary<br>discipline i'm having trouble saying<br>that disciplinarity<br>and this is the death certificate of my<br>great-grandmother<br>my father's grandmother and she<br>died at age 49 in sheffield in england<br>in november 1918 of influenza<br>so was part of the spanish flu and we<br>now that was a hundred years ago and<br>people are now looking at cove and<br>saying well this will the next one will<br>be a hundred years<br>from now because the last one was 100<br>years ago and clearly<br>that is not not the case and we really<br>need to<br>be looking to the future and planning<br>now for how we can respond<br>to what will undoubtedly be recurrences<br>or on their recurrences of<br>of what we're dealing with at the moment<br>and this is a bit harsh but i think<br>there's some truth in it and the history<br>of<br>past history of how we've responded to<br>these events is not great<br>we um we'll go through them we'll review<br>them and then we'll sigh<br>with relief and say we'll pass that and<br>then we'll park our recommendations<br>until the next one comes along and we're<br>now starting to see<br>many many reports from wwf<br>the un the lancet commissions lots of<br>other entities<br>really saying we now have to do better<br>both as a<br>globally and by country and preparing<br>for the next ones and that may come in<br>different shapes and forms but we need<br>to be<br>better at preparing for infectious<br>diseases risks<br>and you'll see a fairly common theme is<br>the idea of people working across<br>boundaries and one in particular is this<br>kind of the idea of this one health<br>approach and this is just one of several<br>entities to our eco-health planetary<br>health they're very similar they come<br>from different origins but they're<br>pretty very very similar in terms of the<br>idea of<br>working across boundaries and this<br>applies particularly well to infectious<br>diseases<br>and the particular triad for one health<br>is the idea of human health<br>animal health environmental health<br>people should be working together<br>both in terms of being able to solve the<br>problems but also for efficiency<br>of resources and the other concept about<br>the<br>trans-disciplinary um we tend to<br>this is a bit of semantics but i think<br>it's important in terms of what we<br>aspire to<br>we tend to sit at the bottom a lot we're<br>in these silos<br>and the science is very good for silos<br>we often talk about being<br>multi-disciplinary we we bring people in<br>if we need them but then sometimes we<br>interact with them but actually what we<br>need to do is<br>get the higher level we're actually<br>changing in response to others and<br>learning from each other and<br>it's very aspirational but actually this<br>is really what we should be trying to do<br>and<br>so this is um there's been a lot of<br>thought about how we should<br>approach the future in this way and to<br>many people this is just common sense<br>and it aligns really well with<br>indigenous thought in this country<br>um but it's really really important as<br>we go forward<br>and we've been trying to to do this for<br>a few years with an anti called one<br>health arterial<br>and it was really borne out of a number<br>of people around the country is<br>interested in efficiencies<br>led by otago and massey we're also with<br>esr as a key partner<br>but not restricted to those institutions<br>and we rewarded flagship research status<br>by the university we're very grateful<br>for that that's<br>enabled us to continue the work<br>and this is our current management group<br>as say based around massi otago and sr<br>but not restricted to those entities<br>with the idea of really trying to enact<br>change in the space<br>and whether it comes as a one health<br>umbrella or not<br>we'll be successful if we're able to<br>change nationally the way that we think<br>about infectious disease and we work<br>across<br>it and it's as i say it's solving<br>problems but also efficiencies<br>you know we could have a next outbreak<br>could be in our primary industries and<br>that would could also be crippling for<br>the country<br>but generic skills across all of those<br>we have them and we should be working<br>together a lot more<br>and just to end i was five years ago i<br>was at this meeting<br>with john mckenzie from australia we<br>were the two australasian<br>representatives it was<br>brought together in haste it was a<br>response to the ebola outbreak in west<br>africa<br>it was trying to how can we do better to<br>predict what we're dealing with at the<br>moment<br>and affects these risks and had an<br>incredible variety of amazing people<br>from around the world<br>really trying to think outside the box<br>and it was a real talk fest<br>and you always wonder what will happen<br>afterwards it was fun at the time but is<br>it actually going to make<br>change and i really struggle with<br>thinking about<br>whether we really did take things along<br>further i think the vaccines<br>clearly we have but i am just not<br>confident again<br>we're in danger of this kind of slippage<br>and for me the<br>the most most memorable was the last<br>talk by this guy<br>because david nabarro is then the un<br>special envoy and a ball he's now the<br>who<br>special envoy on covert and he came<br>straight from the paris<br>climate change conference to our meeting<br>in geneva<br>and he basically sat down said i'm just<br>going to give you these reflections<br>and he went through the the list you see<br>up there he talked about<br>all the stuff i've just talked about<br>having to work together never before<br>has the world been focused so much on<br>public health well<br>he hadn't been uncovered but obviously<br>at the time that was what he was saying<br>and we need to work across disciplines<br>we need to get back to nature we need to<br>show<br>leadership in that group and this was<br>the most amazing talk on leadership<br>i've ever taken in fact i got on the<br>plane and decided to put a late<br>application for my current job<br>true based upon that but it was about<br>the idea<br>of us actually being really really quite<br>different the way we engage with policy<br>makers<br>trying to be agents of change and you<br>know in new zealand we have that<br>opportunity now to do that we could be<br>world leaders<br>in how we respond to infectious disease<br>risk but we're actually going to take<br>that opportunity now and it can't be<br>after<br>this is over once we've reviewed it<br>actually has to be now while it's still<br>raw<br>we're still thinking about it and that's<br>i think it's time to thank the really<br>important people<br>so really who've been incredible support<br>for<br>for such a throughout all this and<br>particularly a very difficult year<br>i was about to say my my parents who<br>came from a very humble background who<br>instilled such<br>strong values in their children thank<br>you for that<br>my name's paul brunton and i'm the pro<br>vice chancellor of health sciences<br>at the university of otago now my role<br>in the next couple of minutes is to<br>summarize the significance of david's<br>lecture<br>and i don't know how you can do that in<br>one or two minutes but i'm going to do<br>my very best<br>so i think what did we hear today we<br>heard<br>about a personal journey in research<br>that was outstanding quite frankly but<br>we also learned about<br>and heard about a collegial and a<br>collaborative approach<br>there were lots of we and teams and<br>that's the success that david brings in<br>his leadership<br>in these research initiatives we also<br>heard<br>of research what i call research in<br>action research with real<br>impact so you know research that is<br>informing policy<br>the national response to covert the<br>international response to covert<br>and many other things because it isn't<br>all about covert<br>and also the final message that i heard<br>was the need to embed research in<br>clinical practice<br>and not have it running alongside on a<br>personal note from somebody who hails<br>from the north of england i'm<br>particularly impressed to hear that he<br>survived a trip to oldham<br>and for those of you who know all them<br>you'll know what i mean<br>so on that basis david on behalf of all<br>of us can i congratulate<br>you on an outstanding lecture and thank<br>you for your contribution wish you all<br>the very best<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
