Let me show you around!<br>Ever since I was little I've always been <br>tinkering and I've always enjoyed coming  <br>up with projects and bringing those projects to life, and through the design degree. I've really  <br>been able to explore my creative side and that's really thanks to the staff and some of my fellow  <br>classmates like Jed over here. <br>There are heaps of different courses to study in the Design Programme.  <br>My favourite this year definitely <br>had to be designing mixed realities.  <br>I'm really enjoying the Design degree as i feel it's teaching me a wide variety of design skills  <br>and design types. It's a tight-knit community and we're always looking out for each other,  <br>and what's really great about it is that <br>I can always ask for help from anyone.  <br>The one thing I was surprised about when I came to the University of Auckland was how accommodating  <br>it was. When I had a tricky question like enrolling in a conjoint degree, there was always someone to  <br>help me and because of this I could really focus on my studies which is what I really wanted.  <br>Through the design degree, there are heaps <br>of different job opportunities for you  <br>just to name a few I can think of - a user <br>experience designer, a game designer and even  <br>a creative technologist - and you can even pioneer your own jobs that haven't even been invented yet. <br>One thing I immediately noticed when I came to the University of Auckland was how multicultural  <br>it was. This has been really good when I've been studying design because every design perspective  <br>and design type is accepted and encouraged. <br>I hope to see you around design, and make sure to check us out online to <br>find out some more information.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
