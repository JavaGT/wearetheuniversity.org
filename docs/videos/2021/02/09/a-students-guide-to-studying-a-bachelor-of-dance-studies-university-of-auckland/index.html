I'm here at the Kenneth Myers Centre  <br>which is one of four studios that we as dancers train at and I'm just going to show you around.<br>I chose to study at the University of <br>Auckland because I recognised the way  <br>in which it valued the philosophies <br>which underpin the dance discipline.  <br>It really encourages a holistic education where history, culture and politics are valued enormously. <br>- so dance as an academic and creative platform.  <br>At Dance Studies we have a diverse range of <br>papers ones which extend from Pacific and  <br>Māori studies, kapa haka to dance politics. <br>Everyone here is super welcoming and friendly and inviting  <br>and it does not matter where you come from or who you are - you're welcome here and I love that!  <br>Many people have chosen completely different career pathways to each other but they've all been  <br>stimulated in each one. Some people have gone on to perform, choreograph, teach, work in communities,  <br>start up their own businesses, research and also advocate for social justice. The culture  <br>here is extremely friendly I think it goes <br>without saying that everyone just wants the  <br>best for each other and wants each other to <br>succeed in whichever way success looks like for them. <br>Jump online if you want to find out <br>more, and we hope to see you around campus soon!</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
