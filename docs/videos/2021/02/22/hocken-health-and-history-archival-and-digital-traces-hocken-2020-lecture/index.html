welcome<br>you to the 2020 hawkins lecture<br>2020 has been a particularly difficult<br>year for all of us<br>and it's absolutely wonderful that the<br>sacrifices that we made<br>prior to lockdown during lockdown and<br>after lockdown<br>have afforded us the kind of freedom<br>that we are currently<br>enjoying this evening now one of the<br>freedoms<br>of course is that we have the<br>opportunity to gather<br>together in a large group which is<br>extraordinarily rare<br>just about anywhere else in the world<br>like you i am sure that you are<br>anticipating<br>an outstanding lecture by our very<br>inspiring hawkins speaker this evening<br>now this year the world has taught us<br>many many things<br>but one of the things that it has taught<br>us is that it has underscored the<br>importance of universities<br>at the beginning of each year at our<br>annual convocation ceremony<br>i remind our students of the words<br>of emeritus professor alan musgrave<br>human knowledge is important it is the<br>greatest<br>achievement of our species it is what<br>more than anything else that sets us<br>apart from the other creatures<br>it's what makes us the most important<br>the most<br>powerful and yes the most dangerous<br>critter<br>that there is it is because<br>human knowledge is so important<br>that universities charged with<br>transmitting and extending that<br>knowledge<br>are also important this year<br>has been a cogent reminder of the<br>importance of knowledge<br>of the importance of universities and of<br>the importance of archives like those<br>held by the hawken the university of<br>otago is incredibly lucky<br>to have the hawking collection as a<br>resource for our academics<br>and our students as well as as a service<br>to the wider research community<br>no other university in new zealand or in<br>australia<br>has a collection that is anywhere near<br>as significant as this one<br>so it's not surprising that two recent<br>recipients of the royal society of new<br>zealand's otonui medal for humanities<br>are professors tony valentine<br>and professor barbara brooks both of<br>whom have worked extensively<br>with the hawkins collections<br>now the annual hawken lecture which we<br>are enjoying this evening<br>was established to reinforce the active<br>role<br>of the hawken in developing cultural<br>understanding<br>it was also established to share the<br>fruits of research conducted<br>at the hawken collection with a wider<br>audience<br>and it's fantastic to see such a wide<br>audience here this evening no my haramai<br>welcome<br>now tonight very shortly we are going to<br>have the opportunity to hear from<br>emeritus professor barbara brooks<br>and very shortly i am going to hand over<br>to professor tony valentine to introduce<br>professor brooks<br>but on a personal note i would like to<br>acknowledge that barbara<br>and her husband emeritus professor paul<br>roth<br>were among the very first people that i<br>met when i arrived in new zealand in<br>1992<br>now i met the brooks roth clan at the<br>university of otago child care center<br>where many many life-long relationships<br>started<br>in addition paul actually taught at my<br>undergraduate college colorado college<br>before i arrived<br>at that stage none of us probably knew<br>that we would create lives and careers<br>in new zealand<br>the academic world is a very small one<br>and we are extremely lucky to have<br>emeritus professor barbara brooks<br>emeritus professor paul roth and their<br>three sons<br>as part of our world here at the<br>university of otago<br>i will now hand over to professor<br>ballentine namihinui kiyokoto no<br>i'm tony valentine and i'm the pvc<br>humanities here at the university and<br>i'm really delighted to be able to<br>introduce our speaker<br>this evening being asked to introduce<br>professor america barbara brooks is both<br>very easy<br>as there is so many there are so many<br>positive things to say<br>and very difficult especially for a<br>dunedin audience because she is so well<br>known what can i say about barbara<br>that you do not already know so in these<br>brief framing remarks<br>i will imagine you don't know anything<br>about her and introduce<br>her in the conventional way and then<br>i'll offer a few reflections i think on<br>some of the key features of her work<br>particularly contributions to our<br>institutional life<br>that i think are particularly useful and<br>helping leiden<br>lead into her lecture this evening<br>in the middle of the year barbara<br>retired after a very distinguished<br>career<br>here at otago although she was born<br>north of the waitaki raised north of the<br>waitaki<br>and that's not its bad thing she was an<br>otago student<br>completing a ba honours and history here<br>before pursuing postgraduate studies in<br>the united states<br>she returned to otago and rose through<br>the ranks in the history department<br>becoming professor and serving a long<br>stint<br>as head of department eight and a half<br>years i think barbara<br>she was also a very prominent and<br>influential figure<br>on campus her leadership and service was<br>wide ranging within the university<br>and beyond and given this evening's<br>occasion it will not be a surprise that<br>she was strongly engaged with the<br>library<br>and hawken collections within her home<br>discipline<br>she was an outstanding teacher and<br>supervisor<br>and i'll say more about this shortly as<br>well as being a very important<br>researcher<br>barbara was a key player and remains a<br>key player<br>and two important historiographical<br>shifts in new zealand's historical<br>writing<br>the turn towards social history that<br>began in the 1970s<br>and the concomitant rise of women's and<br>gender history or then gender history<br>her substantial body of research in the<br>laser field<br>which was advanced through many chapters<br>journal articles<br>and his collections underpinned her<br>landmark<br>a history of new zealand women published<br>by bridget williams books<br>christmas is not far away if you do not<br>own this<br>this is still a great gift for a special<br>person in your life<br>it's also substantial enough that counts<br>but beyond these fields that we all<br>associate barbara with<br>um she's played a key role in opening up<br>other important areas of research<br>in new zealand she has made a very<br>substantial contribution to the history<br>of medicine<br>and also to the history of mental health<br>she has been a key figure in initiating<br>work on the history of emotions here in<br>new zealand<br>particularly through some past breaking<br>scholarship on<br>shame and its histories here<br>as is typical of barbara there was a<br>very tight connection<br>between her research and teaching she<br>developed a great undergraduate paper<br>on scandal and shame in new zealand<br>history<br>such a brief recap can't really serve or<br>offer you know a full justice such a<br>rich career<br>one that's been so very distinguished<br>but i think i can just note some key<br>recent markers<br>of her successes and these include the<br>accolades for this book<br>um that won the occam new zealand<br>book award for the best illustrated<br>non-fiction<br>volume it was shortlisted for the 2017<br>ernest scott prize in australia and new<br>zealand the 2017<br>roth award the wh oliver prize<br>and the 2016 new zealand heritage<br>non-fiction book prize<br>and in 2018 as<br>vice chancellor mentioned she won the<br>humanities aldo nui middle from the<br>sorry the citation recognizing her<br>particular contribution<br>as quote putting women at the center of<br>a substantial<br>and internationally recognized body of<br>scholarly work<br>that of course has been a career-long<br>commitment<br>it is very opposite the barbara won that<br>prize in 2018<br>the 125th anniversary of women's<br>suffrage<br>in new zealand and in that same year she<br>was also made a member<br>of the new zealand order of marriage for<br>services to historical research<br>into women i'm going to end shortly<br>but as a way of leading into this<br>evening's lecture i want to highlight<br>one aspect of barbara's career that is<br>particularly significant<br>for understanding her importance here at<br>otago<br>and i will help i think to frame what we<br>will hear from her this evening<br>one of the defining characteristics of<br>barbara's work was her commitment to<br>training students in the disciplines<br>at the heart of historical research<br>defining research questions<br>locating and exploring as rich and<br>diverse body of archival material as<br>possible<br>and building strong arguments through<br>barbara was a great champion of the old<br>style honours program here at otago<br>where there was a dedicated stream of<br>theory and method classes for<br>undergraduates<br>preparing them for their fourth year of<br>study which included a very substantial<br>piece of original archival research<br>and looking around the room i see many<br>people that went through that<br>experience when we moved to the new<br>model<br>where the honours program became a<br>one-year postgraduate clip-on<br>barbara was also pivotal in redesigning<br>our undergraduate programs<br>making sure that we had great papers<br>preparing students who might go down<br>that pathway<br>but also opening up the opportunity for<br>other undergraduate students<br>to learn about theory method and<br>historiography<br>so barbara was absolutely committed to<br>cultivating a very rich tradition of<br>student research here<br>and that was a tradition that trained<br>her it was a tradition that trained me<br>and that has continued to train our<br>students<br>and today so i think she deserves really<br>huge<br>recognition for her commitment to what<br>we might think of as that feedback loop<br>between teaching and research<br>central to this was archival research<br>something the barber has been a waving<br>champion of<br>just as she has been a tremendous<br>supporter of hawken collections<br>a national treasure that holds an<br>immensely rich body<br>of material so it's fantastic to have<br>her back with us in dunedin this evening<br>and i am delighted to invite you all in<br>joining me and welcoming her<br>thank you all for being here it's lovely<br>to see such a lovely<br>today courtesy of the magnificent<br>bequest he left us<br>we think of thomas moreland hocken as a<br>collector<br>my aim today is to re-emphasize his<br>original profession<br>a medical doctor and to examine how the<br>collection he initiated<br>can throw light on poor health and<br>medical treatment<br>in the past why is this important<br>my original research in the hocken might<br>provide a partial answer<br>as a fourth year student in 1976<br>worked on the 1930s controversy about<br>deaths from septic abortion in doing so<br>i uncovered the then unspoken history<br>of women's fears about an unplanned<br>pregnancy<br>which in the depths of a depression<br>meant precarious family finances<br>would tip into disaster<br>a number of women were willing to rick<br>risk their health<br>if not their lives through procuring a<br>criminal abortion<br>in order to preserve their existing<br>family as this source<br>the statistics of deaths led me to<br>uncover<br>a history of attempts at fertility<br>control<br>which had been regarded as a largely<br>private<br>and in the case of abortion as a<br>criminal matter<br>as the historian of medicine irwin<br>aconect<br>observed whether a person gets sick at<br>all what kind of disease he or she<br>acquires<br>and what kind of treatment he or she<br>receives<br>depend largely on social factors<br>deaths from abortion were a clear<br>example<br>of the way social factors gave rise to<br>what was regarded<br>as a medical crisis<br>when i studied the history of medicine<br>and graduate school with<br>under the direction of the great<br>historian of medicine charles rosenberg<br>i became even more aware of how that<br>history<br>dealt with the big themes of life birth<br>death and the inherently moral questions<br>of how societies provided for the sick<br>and dealt with threats to health<br>rosenberg's landmark book the cholera<br>years<br>demonstrated that a focus on epidemic<br>disease<br>opened up nearly every aspect of society<br>to historical consideration<br>and revealed the contingent nature of<br>medical knowledge<br>in the face of cholera in england in<br>1832 for example<br>king william iv commanded and i quote a<br>public day<br>of fasting and humiliation to beseech<br>god<br>to remove that previous disease<br>our current prime minister urged us to<br>work<br>as a team of 5 million in order to<br>prevent the spread of covert 19.<br>we are now i think well aware of the<br>differential impact<br>the influenza pandemic of 1918<br>had on maori and pakiha but how did our<br>knowledge of public health develop<br>one way it did so was through the work<br>of fifth year medical students<br>at the university of otago and this was<br>from the 1920s through to the 1970s they<br>carried out research exercises<br>which are a tremendous resource housed<br>in the hakken now for researchers<br>i've consulted them for a variety of<br>projects<br>and have recently had students use them<br>for a blog project<br>in the historical methods course some of<br>these blogs<br>have appeared on the medical humanities<br>blog corpus that my co-editor sue wooten<br>and i<br>edit i have had great pleasure in<br>supervising a number of students who<br>have drawn on the hopkins collections to<br>work on aspects of health care<br>some have examined the health<br>professions from the reception<br>of jewish refugee doctors and the<br>evolution of the professions of nursing<br>and dental nursing<br>others have examined aspects of diseases<br>the impact and control of goitre<br>of hydatids and of tuberculosis<br>and in the case of pamela wood the<br>cultural history of dirt<br>that made 19th century dunedin known as<br>mud<br>eden<br>diana brown's m.a thesis and now fine<br>biography of muriel bell was based on<br>bell's papers in the hocken<br>which have recently been inscribed on<br>the prestigious unesco<br>memory of the world new zealand register<br>other students have looked at aspects of<br>institutional history such as ashburn<br>hall<br>or the bassam hospital the latter which<br>provided pioneering care for children<br>born with cleft palate in all of these<br>studies<br>personal and familial suffering sits<br>alongside national policies and<br>professional interests<br>it is this conjunction of factors that<br>makes the history of medicine<br>so compelling and which lies in its<br>power to inform us today<br>in the era of a new pandemic<br>i will examine those factors in three<br>ways<br>first by an examination of a case<br>involving dr hawkin<br>in 1871 second by exploring a patient's<br>perspective<br>in 1921 and third<br>by taking a broad view of attitudes<br>towards<br>experts in matarangi matarangimari<br>tohanga over the 20th century<br>i want to begin with thomas moreland's<br>hawkins practice in dunedin<br>suggesting how one of his cases reveals<br>insight<br>into personal suffering professional<br>rivalries<br>and public policy this case became<br>apparent to me<br>through the wonderful digital source<br>papers past to which the hopkin has<br>contributed<br>those digitized newspapers make it<br>possible to track people's public<br>activities<br>in a way they might never have imagined<br>ali clark has discussed some dimensions<br>of this case<br>in her prize-winning book born into a<br>changing world<br>so here's the young and dr hockham<br>in december 1870 when the 34 year old dr<br>hawkins had been practicing in dunedin<br>for<br>eight years he was called to the case of<br>a woman<br>who had been delivered of a stillborn<br>child<br>margaret cochran wife of a commission<br>agent<br>began labour in her kavisham home on<br>wednesday december<br>14th and the midwife who attended her<br>previous births<br>mrs allen waterhouse was summoned<br>on friday morning margaret who had<br>already borne 10 children<br>and had one miscarriage was delivered of<br>a stillborn<br>child she later complained to the<br>midwife<br>of a pain in her abdomen and mrs<br>waterhouse applied hot<br>oatmeal bags to her swollen stomach and<br>gave her castor oil<br>concerned that his wife was not<br>improving on the following<br>tuesday morning edward cochran sent a<br>message calling for dr hocken<br>who duly came and prescribed medicines<br>hawkins suggested that mrs waterhouse<br>should have no more to do with the case<br>the following day mrs waterhouse<br>returned and seeing mrs cochran<br>said that dr hawkins should be here that<br>the patient was sinking<br>mr cochran went to summon hocken who was<br>unavailable<br>at that time when he returned home<br>cochran found his wife dying dr hochen<br>visited on thursday afternoon<br>and mrs cochran died that evening<br>at this ensuing coroner's inquest<br>held at the edinburgh castle hotel<br>inquests were commonly held in hotels at<br>their time<br>hopkin and dr alexander gave evidence<br>that the death was the result of a<br>protracted labour of 48 hours<br>in their view mrs cochran's life would<br>have been saved<br>if skilled assistance had been sought at<br>an earlier stage<br>the jury returned a verdict of death<br>through natural causes<br>and blamed the midwife for not calling<br>in<br>medical help at an earlier date<br>significantly they also recommended<br>a reduction in medical charges<br>when first called to the case dr hocken<br>asked edward cochrane<br>why he had not had a medical man from<br>the first<br>cochran answered that his wife wanted to<br>economize<br>and that mrs whitewaterhouse had<br>attended her before<br>hawking declared that if anything went<br>wrong with this case he'd sift it to the<br>bottom<br>his concern may well have been the<br>reason why alan waterhouse<br>was charged with manslaughter in the<br>mayor's court<br>on the 31st of january 1871.<br>i had fun finding out what amir's court<br>was but i'll<br>tell you about that if you want to know<br>later the prosecution declared that mrs<br>waterhouse<br>had shown criminal inattention by<br>allowing a protracted labour<br>and not calling in a medical man<br>mr barton for the defence argued the<br>medical profession brought the case<br>purely<br>to make this prosecution a vehicle for<br>preserving their monopoly<br>citing russell on crimes he argued that<br>mrs waterhouse was in exactly the same<br>footing as a medical man<br>who if they honestly exercised their<br>best skill<br>but the patient died were not guilty of<br>manslaughter<br>he charged that hocken and others<br>intended to shut the assistance of<br>midwives out from the poor<br>who could not afford medical men's<br>high fees while dr hocken had the<br>support of dr<br>alexander three other doctors<br>experienced in midwifery defended mrs<br>waterhouse<br>in the end the bench decided that mrs<br>waterhouse had done her best<br>that culpable negligence and want of<br>skill were unproved<br>and the case was duly discharged with an<br>outback<br>burst of applause in the court<br>mrs waterhouse's trial makes us consider<br>a time<br>when women's lives were tightly bound to<br>the numerous children they bore<br>and the risks they took to bear them we<br>see the agony of her husband<br>and think of her 10 other children left<br>motherless<br>we also see the ambitions of medical men<br>in a new colony<br>hoping to make their mark by asserting<br>their scientific superiority<br>and striving to limit the practice of<br>health care for themselves<br>hawkins concern about the quality of<br>care was perhaps heightened by a<br>previous encounter<br>with mrs waterhouse in his role as<br>coroner<br>and not purely instrumental but his<br>own examination of the patient was shown<br>to be cursory<br>and he was known to take at least 10<br>pounds a day<br>which is the equivalent of 1400 today<br>per day in fees we see the public's<br>objection to those high medical fees<br>with the jury asking that they be<br>reduced and their support for the<br>midwife<br>in an outburst of applause that greeted<br>her discharge<br>in the course of the hearing the lawyers<br>also pointed out that there was no<br>requirement for the licensing of<br>midwives in new zealand<br>and this raised an issue of public<br>policy that was not resolved until the<br>1904 midwives act<br>the questions of who should attend birth<br>and how they should be paid<br>have continued to be subject to dispute<br>up to the present day<br>in this case we see the matrix in which<br>medicine is embedded<br>that is once social economic political<br>and cultural my second example comes<br>from 50 years later<br>and from the view of a privileged<br>patient with no desire like that which<br>propelled margaret cochran<br>to economize the first forays into the<br>history of medicine were generally<br>by medical practitioners who were<br>fascinated<br>by the role and practices of their<br>predecessors<br>a g hawkins life of dr hocken is a good<br>example<br>social historians from the 1970s onwards<br>were keen to recuperate the experience<br>of patients<br>asking questions such as how did<br>patients access and experience<br>healthcare in the hawken archives lie<br>the correspondence of mary downey<br>stewart<br>oh okay i've said this before but they<br>are designed for male suit pockets<br>so the sort of history of medicine i was<br>trained in we were very keen to learn<br>about<br>the experience of patients and<br>in the hawkenaw archives lie the<br>correspondence of mary danny stewart<br>a woman from a well-to-do dunedin family<br>who moved as<br>as her disabled brothers hostess<br>in the highest reaches of new zealand<br>society<br>william danny stewart's career first as<br>mayor of dunedin and then as a member of<br>parliament and cabinet minister was<br>enabled<br>as historian rachel patrick has so well<br>argued<br>by the labour of his older sister<br>mary assisted him in coping with his<br>life-long debility<br>caused by rheumatoid arthritis<br>which confined him largely to a<br>wheelchair<br>it is to mary's much briefer encounter<br>with illness that i wish to turn<br>and i wish to thank yvonne wilkie for<br>first bringing this to my attention<br>since william downey stewart's returned<br>from war service in 1916<br>mary devoted herself to his care and a<br>continual search for cure<br>but in 1921 it was her turn to deal with<br>ill health<br>mary had been to see dr agnes bennett<br>about her problems<br>who had heightened her concern about the<br>possibility<br>dr bennett mary wrote looked so serious<br>during her examination which led mary to<br>imagine<br>that my womb and both breasts might be<br>removed<br>her concern was alleviated by a visit to<br>the bowen street hospital begun by w<br>e herbert and dr h hardwick smith<br>this is the hospital<br>just across the road from parliament was<br>beside the old alexander timbal library<br>bone street was one of the 260 private<br>hospitals in the country<br>run as business enterprises 165 of which<br>were maternity homes<br>when mary asked dr herbert if her<br>condition was serious<br>he reassured her that he'd take his life<br>that whatever was happening with her<br>ovaries<br>wasn't malignant you are not to worry he<br>continued<br>because we'll fix you up and take care<br>of you<br>unlike agnes bennett who was reluctant<br>to give her patient any unconfirmed<br>diagnosis<br>dr herbert made mary feel as if he were<br>a big brother and i found this charming<br>slide<br>of the national library supplied me this<br>charming picture of dr herbert with his<br>three daughters mary downey stewart was<br>suffering from an ovarian cyst<br>it was agnes bennett who first informed<br>her that both her ovaries had been<br>removed<br>and how this would cause early menopause<br>a fact that mary checked with dr herbert<br>her 13-pound ovarian cyst which is<br>nearly 6 kilos<br>appeared minor she reported<br>compared to the 40 pound 18 kilo<br>cyst endured by a nun which was removed<br>by dr barnett at dunedin stafford street<br>hospital<br>dr herbert told mary her diseased<br>ovaries were only a menace<br>and reassured her that a voice would not<br>let get like a man's<br>and there was nothing to worry about at<br>all<br>dr bennett on the other hand warned the<br>early onset of menopause would likely<br>cause depression<br>irritability and headaches and so mary<br>should take time to convalesce<br>mary was intrigued by the operation<br>asking dr bennett for copies of the<br>photos taken of the removed cyst<br>my hat she wrote what a butcher shop it<br>looks<br>her brother did not share her enthusiasm<br>for viewing the photographs<br>when she attempted to show them to him<br>and to others<br>he was shocked and disgusted and said i<br>must<br>never show them to anybody<br>mary was well looked after in her<br>private room at the hospital tucked into<br>a bed with a hot water bottle<br>and supplied with good food for a month<br>friends visited frequently sent oysters<br>and stout<br>quail an abundance of flowers and<br>whiskey and soda<br>when it came time to leave the hospital<br>mary remarked how she would miss the<br>nursing sisters<br>very much and all the waiting on<br>as someone who spent her life waiting on<br>her brother<br>this was a time of rare respite for mary<br>she wrote it has been such a wonderful<br>experience<br>one of the most wonderful in my life the<br>revelation of the kindness<br>in the world and the revelation of god's<br>nearness<br>i hope the latter will not leave me when<br>i get back to the busy world<br>again mary downey stewart had every<br>assistance and comfort in bowen street<br>private hospital<br>the kind of care that those with the<br>resources could buy<br>her recovery however wasn't entirely<br>straightforward she suffered the<br>depression bennett predicted<br>noting and yet with all my luxury<br>friends and love<br>i had my groggy days when i wish i had<br>not come out of the chloroform<br>and when i pray very earnestly that god<br>will let me die<br>the operation she

members<br>helped her through<br>the wealth and social connections of the<br>dani stewart family ensured that mary<br>had the best of care for her operation<br>she chose to have it in wellington no<br>doubt to be close to her brother who at<br>the time<br>was minister of internal affairs and the<br>reformed government<br>in the bowen street private hospital<br>across from parliament she recorded her<br>progress in letters to her sister rachel<br>hence we can now read about her<br>experience<br>mary obviously felt herself the social<br>equal of her doctors<br>and able to ask them anything including<br>for the photos of her specimen<br>while she was pleased to be able to<br>consult a woman doctor<br>she preferred the paternalism of dr<br>herbert to dr bennett's realistic advice<br>the doctors followed her progress once<br>she left the hospital<br>dr herbert writing to her saying he<br>could not take her depression seriously<br>many new zealanders however did not have<br>such ready access<br>and such familiarity with their doctors<br>and<br>few could afford to afford a month away<br>from their breadwinning or domestic<br>duties<br>mary downey stewart's ability to consult<br>a woman doctor about her internal<br>troubles<br>was a privilege only available to a few<br>even if she preferred dr herbert's<br>paternalism<br>most people could not afford to travel<br>for specialised treatment<br>those in rural districts were<br>particularly disadvantaged<br>in 1919 the otago daily times described<br>dunedin hospital<br>as extensive and modernly equipped where<br>patients had the service of a strong<br>honorary<br>staff no such facility existed the<br>editorial pointed out for the people of<br>the catlins district<br>but even dunedin hospital faced the<br>problem of recruiting an<br>adequate number of nurses which one<br>member of the hospital board<br>suggested was due to nursing's low<br>status<br>compared to the new profession of dental<br>nursing<br>the latter was more attractive to young<br>women as it was better paid<br>and required only two years as opposed<br>to three years of training<br>problems of recruiting a workforce force<br>and questions of access<br>and equity in medical care so central<br>today<br>were equally debated in the past those<br>debates<br>led to the first labour government's<br>introduction of free hospital care<br>for all in 1939 and its attempt to<br>create<br>free access to primary health care<br>strenuously opposed by the new<br>zealand branch of the british medical<br>association<br>my third example takes a long view and<br>examines the place of experts<br>tohanga in all branches of matarang and<br>maori<br>warfare growing crops recounting history<br>and healing to see how understandings of<br>disease<br>were embedded in cultural codes<br>in the marsden online a wonderful<br>resource for researchers that has made<br>the marsden collection available to<br>scholars worldwide<br>thomas kendall recorded in 1815<br>how an artwork had entered the chief<br>ruatara<br>making him ill and also making him<br>a sacred person who no one could<br>approach<br>but a touhou or close family members<br>so the second sentence from<br>online<br>nearly a century later tohanga had<br>become the people most reviled<br>by those maori men who were the first to<br>study western medicine<br>allegiance to touhou became a cultural<br>fault line<br>men who regarded themselves as modern<br>and scientific<br>were scathing about their rival healing<br>counterparts<br>who they saw as a degraded version of<br>the traditional<br>high priests maori<br>inhabited a porous world where spirits<br>and gods made themselves known<br>in numerous ways<br>interpreted this world and how to behave<br>in it<br>christianity offered different<br>interpretations<br>and the first maori men who traded it in<br>medicine<br>were pupils at thiate college run by the<br>anglican church<br>there under the charismatic leadership<br>of john thornton<br>who had begun his career with the church<br>missionary society in<br>india they took christianity seriously<br>and began to abdure supernatural aspects<br>of their own culture<br>and tohanga in particular the men i am<br>discussing here<br>tutere ripa peter bak te rangahiro<br>and maui pomade pursued european<br>medicine<br>in order to address the serious<br>depopulation<br>and poor health of maori communities<br>while at school the young men men had<br>supported proposals for health reform<br>and toured local communities encouraging<br>the abolition<br>of injurious customs<br>maui pomade was the first to embark on a<br>medical career<br>and encouraged by the seventh-day<br>adventists he went to he met at napier<br>decided to leave new zealand and to<br>study medicine at their battle creek<br>college in michigan<br>palmade then attended the american<br>medical missionary college<br>at chicago graduating md in 1899.<br>in that year fellow tiate students to<br>terewe ripa and peter buck<br>traveled down to dunedin to begin<br>medical training<br>at the university of otago<br>medical training required a new attitude<br>to the body<br>according to the ethnographer ellsden<br>best the tapu from touching a dead body<br>was extremely strong and prohibitory<br>it rendered the person unclean and<br>unable to mix with his family or fellows<br>until he had been purified the tapu<br>taken off him<br>as a source of defilement the touching<br>or handling of courses<br>corpses was preeminent<br>ritual cleansing provided by tohanga in<br>the past<br>was vitally necessary even if those who<br>had been killed<br>were slaves who were thought to be<br>without tapu<br>such ideas had no place in late 19th<br>century medical training committed as<br>its teachers were to the facts<br>revealed to the eye for example by<br>dissection<br>to tere ripa perhaps concerned that<br>misunderstandings might arise about<br>medical training in mighty communities<br>was moved to write about the experience<br>of working<br>in the room for cutting up corpses and<br>thank you to lockheed<br>patterson who alerted me to this<br>in the november 1900<br>issue of the church of england maori<br>language newspaper<br>he discussed the dissection room where<br>he wrote<br>that it was important to ensure that<br>people have truthful knowledge about it<br>he described the room and the way the<br>bodies were immersed in chemicals to<br>preserve them<br>and again thanks to lockheed for the<br>translation<br>students worked in pairs and 10 students<br>worked on one body<br>he noted that women were training<br>alongside the men to be doctors<br>and that there was an important purpose<br>in cutting up the bodies<br>it was not for pleasure or as a trick<br>it was to teach about the amazing<br>aspects of the human body<br>it was a wonder of creation and made by<br>jehovah<br>just under the angels<br>by the late 19th century christianity<br>provided a justification for an<br>act previously full of danger in<br>rejecting<br>the existence of supernatural beings<br>such as typo<br>and kehua it emphasized a separation<br>of the somatic and supernatural worlds<br>this became an essential prior<br>separation to the public health work<br>that these men undertook in the future<br>at a time when maori were dying from a<br>range of preventable diseases<br>due to the dispossession of their land<br>and the undermining of their communal<br>culture<br>by an emphasis on individualism public<br>health practitioners in otago<br>were preoccupied with separation they<br>insisted<br>in separation of people from each other<br>hence the term<br>overcrowding was separating excreta<br>from conta and but containing it hence<br>pit toilets and handkerchiefs with the<br>separation of dirt from bodies<br>hence the centrality of hygiene with the<br>separation of animals from<br>humans and with the separation of water<br>sources<br>from animal contamination<br>these ideas about separation were<br>underpinned of course by the germ theory<br>developments in bacteriology and also<br>middle class<br>views about the right ways of living<br>germs and the need for their eradication<br>were at the heart of public health<br>practice germs were unseen sources of<br>danger and hygiene practices<br>with the way to counteract them and<br>thank you to the hawken<br>for supplying these wonderful posters<br>which are actually<br>slightly later than the the period i'm<br>i'm talking about<br>traditional maori communities had their<br>own conceptions of space<br>and separation guided by the concepts of<br>tapu<br>sacred and noah common ideas about the<br>unseen sources of<br>illness and enduring links of whakapapa<br>and land<br>these ideas and revered practitioners of<br>healing who could interpret the<br>influence of wider relationships<br>had been undermined by colonisation<br>old patterns of living in which latrines<br>were well separated from housing and<br>water supplies for example<br>were undermined by land loss and<br>relocation<br>and the tussle between these systems the<br>public health model based on unseen<br>germs and the maori model of illness<br>caused by larger<br>unseen forces tohanga became painted as<br>culprits keeping past<br>beliefs alive peter buck wrote<br>in his 1910 otago md thesis<br>the greatest factor which retards the<br>progress of the maori in health matters<br>is the influence of the past<br>present-day touhou he argued had brought<br>the once-honored name<br>into disgrace they were charlatans who<br>played upon the credulity of the people<br>to achieve notoriety and make money<br>the danger of touhou had been marked in<br>the maori councils act<br>1900 which was framed to give some<br>limited self-government to mighty<br>communities in order to promote<br>education<br>sanitation and suppress injurious<br>maori customs such councils were<br>empowered to prevent common<br>nuisances in order to promote health and<br>to regulate the proceedings of tohanga<br>and to punish by a fine those with the<br>european or maori<br>who practice upon the superstition or<br>credulity<br>of any maori in connection with the<br>treatment of any disease<br>maui pomade was appointed maori health<br>officer when he returned to new zealand<br>in 1901<br>by 1903 pomeray was arguing<br>for a specific law to prohibit<br>tohangai-ism<br>he realised that maori went to tohanga<br>because they had few alternatives<br>but he argued that properly qualified<br>medical men<br>should be sent to maori districts<br>in that year the maori councils passed a<br>series of bylaws to control tohanga<br>including licensing which involved<br>payment of a fee<br>but prohibited tohanga from charging for<br>their services<br>forbade them from using a traditional<br>practice of bathing the sick in cold<br>water<br>and preventing tohanga who gained a<br>following from traveling around<br>and disrupting kyonga<br>by 1907 concern of modern maori men was<br>such that they backed<br>james carroll's introduction of the<br>which stated every person who gathers<br>maoris around him by practicing on their<br>superstition or credulity or who<br>misleads or attempts to mislead any<br>maori by professing<br>or pretending to profess supernatural<br>powers and the treatment to cure<br>of any disease or in the foretelling of<br>future events or otherwise<br>is liable to a summary conviction before<br>a magistrate i won't read you the whole<br>thing but you know the main thing is<br>tohanga are now outlawed<br>for the first half of the 20th century<br>sorry the first half of the 20th century<br>was a period of both hope<br>and despair for maori hope that the<br>population was increasing and despair<br>and that the rates of illness remained<br>high<br>and all ways of living were no longer<br>possible on reduced lands<br>traditional beliefs survived in new<br>maori religious movement<br>movements such as the ringer ii faith<br>the refusal of orangutu community to<br>accept a medical attendant<br>led a maori welfare officer in the 1930s<br>to comment on their belief<br>that god alone would contribute to the<br>recovery of the sick<br>they genuinely held it it was not<br>however a belief that could be corrected<br>by any form of compulsion<br>he said we must convince them that there<br>are undoubtedly benefits to be derived<br>by calling<br>in a doctor or a nurse in a case of<br>illness<br>two otago medical students investigating<br>health conditions<br>in maori communities in the hokianga in<br>1932<br>found people reluctant to discuss<br>tohanga<br>effectively concealing their practices<br>all the students could glean was that<br>tohanga were called upon in cases of<br>serious illness<br>where they performed mysterious rights<br>used herbal preparations<br>and provided a psychological cure even<br>if the material conditions<br>had not improved the students found that<br>the trees and shrubs widely used by the<br>traditional healers and various<br>preparations were efficacious<br>and found this work of the touhou to be<br>very commendable<br>but expressed great concern about the<br>play<br>on superstition evidence that<br>superstition remained deeply ingrained<br>they noted<br>could be seen in the deathbed faith of<br>the average<br>maori in the tohanga later student<br>investigators<br>also noted the resilience of resort to<br>tohanga and communities<br>in 1948 one reported that the tikuiti<br>in the tikuiti district the maori doctor<br>was<br>intimately connected with the religious<br>aspect of maori life<br>his education on medical subjects had<br>been handed down by his predecessors<br>and he treated his patients to the best<br>of his ability<br>the student noted the fear in the<br>community of hospitals and institutions<br>which were associated with death<br>by the early 1950s the new zealand<br>government<br>employed film to engage maori with the<br>western health system<br>and in particular to be willing to have<br>members of their whanau<br>enter hospitals in 1951<br>the national film unit's didactic<br>production which you can all watch<br>easily on new zealand on screen araha<br>a study of the maori people a young<br>maori chief's daughter<br>is studying at university<br>her embrace of modernity is such that<br>she persuades her ill father to ignore<br>the advice of the touhou that he is<br>dying among his people at home<br>and instead to enter hospital where he<br>is cured<br>the very fact that the influence of<br>tohanga had to be addressed<br>on screen i think is testament to their<br>ongoing influence<br>repeal of the tohanga suppression act<br>took place in 1962 as part of a larger<br>act pertaining to maori welfare<br>by then maori members of the house the<br>maori member<br>of the house of southern maori sir<br>terekatani believed that christianity<br>had put paid to primitive rights and<br>beliefs<br>while the pakeha minister of maori<br>affairs named the 1907 act<br>as a discriminatory piece of legislation<br>by 1968 in a symposium on the maori<br>people<br>anthropologist eric schwimmer noted that<br>few maori thought only a touhou could<br>cure all diseases<br>but they believe that in addition to<br>natural causes there are spiritual<br>causes also<br>he continued such a view is defensible<br>on logical grounds<br>even if the death of a child run over by<br>a motorcar has a palpably natural<br>cause we may still ask<br>why this child had to die and why<br>at this time only the spiritual realm he<br>believed<br>could help provide answers<br>mason jury son of a pakiha mother<br>and maori father was immersed in both<br>worlds<br>growing up but found when he entered<br>medical school at<br>otago in the late 1950s<br>that the study of disease has altered<br>little from the paradigm encountered by<br>the first generation of maori students<br>study was firmly based on discrete<br>systems an assumption of separation<br>between mind and body<br>and lacked any sense of connectedness<br>between<br>systems between comorbidities and<br>between people<br>and their social and natural<br>environments<br>jury's decision to study psychiatry he<br>suggests<br>may well have been an attempt to match<br>biomedicine<br>with the wider appreciation of the human<br>condition<br>that interest may have led him to study<br>what was then called<br>mongolism and what we now know is down<br>syndrome<br>for his 1962 fifth year preventive<br>medicine thesis<br>and i think in that very naming we see<br>how clearly medicine is embedded in<br>cultural understanding<br>jerry's opportunity came when he studied<br>at mcgill in the late 1960s<br>where those working in community and<br>trans-cultural psychiatry<br>highlighted the impact of wider social<br>structures of oppression<br>such as racism and damaging the<br>well-being of individuals<br>their jury's interest in the way culture<br>determined how mental health might be<br>conceived<br>led to his determination to<br>reconceptualize mental health in new<br>zealand<br>in terms he said that made sense to my<br>own people<br>the political climate of the 1970s and<br>80s allowed new directions in health<br>particularly<br>increased attention to the treaty of<br>waitangi after decades of maori<br>agitation<br>working within these trained<br>circumstances and supported by maori<br>leaders<br>jury advocated for an indigenous<br>dimension to the health services<br>arguing that little would change until<br>maori had a sense of ownership over<br>health<br>which required a recognition of amongst<br>other things<br>of the inseparability of taha wairua<br>to wellbeing this allowed agreement<br>for the official restoration of tohanga<br>into the health workforce<br>tracing the history of touhou suggests<br>how a health service that ignored<br>maori epistemologies failed in terms of<br>engagement and meaning<br>a recognition currently acknowledged<br>albeit<br>in insufficient and patchy ways<br>the first maori medical men fervently<br>believed that their faith in science<br>would be rewarded<br>by improved health for maori<br>their efforts to protect communities<br>through public health initiatives<br>resulted in a denial of supernatural<br>beliefs<br>those initiatives led to clean water<br>better sanitation and fewer deaths from<br>preventable diseases but<br>such physical measures prove not to be<br>enough for communities<br>who clung to the wisdom of the tohanga<br>that form of indigenous knowledge has<br>resurfaced to challenge a dichotomy<br>between physical<br>and spiritual wellbeing with benefits<br>for the mighty community<br>and perhaps beyond i've traced three<br>discrete episodes from the history of<br>medicine<br>made apparent to me through the archival<br>and digital<br>resources of the hocken collections<br>the sad case of mrs cochrane reminds us<br>of the hazards of birth in the 19th<br>century<br>of the competing interests of health<br>providers<br>and the importance of the affordability<br>of care<br>from mary downey stewart's letters we<br>get a glimpse into the experience of a<br>privileged<br>patient in a private hospital and the<br>assumed equal relationship<br>of such a patient with her doctors<br>with the advent of more women in<br>medicine and more maori and pacific<br>practitioners<br>we have the prospect that many more<br>people will feel similarly at ease<br>with their health professionals insights<br>into maori communities provided by fifth<br>year medical students in their public<br>health dissertations<br>allow us to understand the dynamic<br>interplay between maori and pakiha<br>cultural practices<br>around healing over time with disruption<br>ebbs and flows and the re-emergence of<br>much<br>older elements that reshape the new<br>according to a much more foundational<br>cultural<br>code i suggest we need histories of<br>medicine and society<br>in order to attend to contemporary<br>health issues<br>and the hawken collections provide a<br>rich resource for such studies<br>we cannot understand who is vulnerable<br>today<br>without a knowledge of the past<br>specific policies made an important<br>impact<br>as our former student john ryan<br>maclean's 2012 phd thesis<br>on the 1918 influenza pandemic in<br>western polynesia<br>has shown no deaths occurred in american<br>samar<br>while 50 kilometers away a quarter of<br>the inhabitants died<br>in new zealand administered western<br>samoa<br>history helps us to understand why maori<br>communities living in economically and<br>culturally deprived circumstances caused<br>by colonisation<br>have lower life expectancy than pakiha<br>the recent survey of life and death in<br>new zealand by epidemiologists woodward<br>and blakely suggests that health<br>improvements amongst maori<br>relied on a paradigm shift to a secular<br>worldview<br>that conceives of illness as amenable to<br>human intervention<br>but in the end that notion of the<br>triumph of secular science<br>as mason jury's contribution has<br>indicated<br>is insufficient actually trusting<br>maori and pacific communities to take<br>their own measures<br>in their own way in the covert pandemic<br>has led to effective quarantine in some<br>ewe areas<br>and very high levels of testing among<br>auckland pacific peoples<br>medicine exists of course to serve the<br>suffering patient<br>we might hope that the revelation of<br>kindness<br>that mary downey stuart experienced as a<br>result of her illness in 1921<br>so<br>many thanks barbara that was just<br>fantastic<br>it was a lecture that spoke not only to<br>the arc of your own work but also the<br>incredible riches<br>of the hocking itself i'd like to<br>introduce to you<br>dr miranda johnson who will respond to<br>barbara's lecture<br>miranda recently joined the history<br>program here at otago<br>she came from the university of sydney<br>but previously held positions at the<br>university of wisconsin in the<br>university of michigan<br>and her phds from the university of<br>chicago that's a pretty fantastic<br>intellectual genealogy of course<br>reaching its apogee<br>she is an outstanding scholar of<br>comparative indigenous histories<br>uh critical histories of the law in the<br>history of settler colonialism<br>her work has been deeply concerned with<br>how we access the past and<br>the political work that historical<br>scholarship<br>and of course in our mutu here<br>so can you please join me and welcome<br>um thank you for that lovely<br>introduction tony and to sharon for the<br>invitation<br>it's a real privilege to be asked to<br>respond to barbara's rich<br>paper and i'm especially grateful for<br>the opportunity to be able to<br>acknowledge<br>barbara's personal influence on me and<br>her encouragement of my work throughout<br>my career<br>i know i'm not the only student and<br>scholar to have benefited from her<br>attentiveness<br>barbara always poses central questions<br>of our time<br>and does so with a light touch and in a<br>resonant<br>and personal way this evening her<br>lecture has addressed<br>themes of power gender race<br>and indigeneity in the context of<br>changing practices of medicine<br>and public health what could be<br>more fitting for consideration in 2020<br>and woven through all her examples are<br>connections to dunedin<br>to the university of otago and even to<br>dr hocken himself<br>i want to address what i see as a<br>central thorny question<br>in the lecture which concerns the making<br>of medical knowledge<br>and the politics of applying such<br>knowledge in various colonial contexts<br>barbara referred to this problematic<br>several times in the lecture<br>as one of separability for instance<br>the separability of the somatic or<br>embodied<br>and supernatural or beyond the body<br>worlds<br>that modernizing public health officials<br>such as maui pumari<br>advocated and aiming to improve what<br>today we would call the health outcomes<br>of maori in early 20th century new<br>zealand<br>this involved attempts to suppress<br>tohonga or esoteric experts<br>whose own distinctions between tapu and<br>noah<br>sacred and common also worked to<br>classify<br>worlds but according to different some<br>might say<br>enchanted terms rather than that of<br>secular modernity<br>as barbara elegantly points out these<br>attempts to separate<br>and indeed to suppress tohonga did<br>transform<br>but did not eliminate the status<br>and function of these experts over the<br>course of the century<br>perhaps because as eric schwimmer put it<br>in barbara's quote medical science can<br>often only provide answers<br>in generalized aggregated or even<br>abstract<br>terms and not in the highly particular<br>contingent ones that are so meaningful<br>to us<br>in our individual circumstances why this<br>child<br>barbara provides other examples of<br>attempts to separate out<br>what medical practitioners regarded as<br>good or modern<br>science and bad traditional practice<br>for example dr hawkins argument against<br>the midwife in court<br>following the death of margaret cochrane<br>after a<br>difficult labor in this instance<br>the attempt to separate a traditional or<br>customary world<br>from a world of science is gendered<br>medical science inhabited and performed<br>by credentialized men<br>who charged exhortantly for their<br>services<br>and customary knowledge performed by<br>women such as the midwife mrs waterhouse<br>again although mod although modern<br>science is powerful<br>it's not the clear winner in the contest<br>the charge of manslaughter against mrs<br>waterhouse is thrown out<br>and she appears to have had considerable<br>public support<br>if the applause in the court is anything<br>to go by<br>so in alerting us to these attempts at<br>separating the modern from the<br>traditional the scientific from the<br>customary<br>and indeed the attempts to suppress the<br>traditional and customary by the modern<br>and scientific<br>barbara's argument is not an<br>anti-modernist or activistic one<br>she's not arguing that we should or even<br>that we can<br>reclaim and reinhabit some pre-modern<br>customary world<br>but it does seem to me that she's posing<br>for us through sharp illustration<br>the central problem of modernity which<br>is the relationship of the modern to the<br>pre-modern<br>while modernists assumed that the<br>pre-modern would be left behind<br>relegated to the past what in fact<br>barbara shows so well<br>is how the modern and the traditional<br>are co-inhabited<br>often intense relation and also how they<br>shape<br>each other history as a discipline<br>at times emulates modern science and its<br>truth practices and evidentiary<br>procedures<br>and the archive in this sense is a<br>repository of fact<br>and a place for establishing proof<br>but it is also deeply engaged in the<br>ancient craft<br>of storytelling and in this sense<br>history is not only a modern knowledge<br>practice<br>by engaging both modern scientific<br>practices<br>and ancient narrative arts historians<br>themselves cross that bright line<br>between the modern and the customary<br>they can help us to see<br>these thresholds and reveal how we all<br>move between worlds<br>sometimes seamlessly sometimes with<br>difficulty<br>and at personal cost and particularly<br>now<br>this is a lived truth that we can<br>reflect on at the year<br>at the end of the year benefiting from<br>epidemiological knowledge<br>in our country expertly followed by our<br>elected representatives<br>while at the same time we furnish our<br>experience of<br>and our commitments to our communities<br>in much<br>older precious languages of care<br>and trust that revelation of kindness<br>that barbara ends with<br>thank you miranda for a for a very<br>eloquent and thoughtful response to<br>barbara's lecture<br>we're going to have time for some<br>questions so<br>the floor will be open barbara will<br>respond<br>i'm sure i'm not<br>before i ask a question about the<br>different<br>experiences<br>before i asked that question about samoa<br>the you referred to<br>the new zealand branch of the british<br>medical association<br>promotion of private medicine see i'm<br>not a doctor<br>i'm not a historian and i'm not a lawyer<br>but i believe what the british medical<br>association was attempting to do<br>was to keep the relationship between the<br>gp<br>and the patient subject to private law<br>whereas the hospitals in new zealand<br>were<br>going to be subject to public law i<br>think they were trying to preserve their<br>ability to charge fees actually<br>well the fee the fee was meant to be a<br>peppercorn fee so that it could remain<br>as a<br>well i think we could debate this but<br>they were very strenuously<br>opposed to becoming states<br>yeah like i like i've got a different<br>view but some more<br>you can put it differently when you<br>write your book<br>some more white what was the reason what<br>was the reason why<br>american samoa did so well during the<br>flu you'll have to read john mcclane's<br>thesis<br>on otago archive but it is partly to do<br>with the american<br>naval presence and the imposition of<br>yes i'm interested uh um<br>hocken was the coroner in the targo<br>area do you know the name of the uh<br>coroner that investigated the um<br>death of um the patient<br>and do you think um<br>would there be a friendship between dr<br>hocken and<br>the other coroner you think which would<br>affect the decision<br>oh well actually hocken and alexander<br>did the autopsy themselves<br>so um<br>and i mean i i didn't go into all the<br>gruesome details<br>uh but there's a lot of debate about<br>whether the cause of death was<br>protracted labour<br>right but actually they exaggerated the<br>length of the labour it wasn't 48 hours<br>jocelyn<br>it is it's a way for me to keep in shape<br>barbara can you tell me what's the<br>present status of of<br>dr smith's experiments in the hokianga<br>with paramedical<br>staff how do people think about that now<br>do you know<br>it's just i found a pamphlet of his the<br>other day which i've given to peter<br>crempton<br>just and it's kind of weird but on the<br>other hand<br>you mean the dr smith of hogan doctor<br>smith<br>yes yes dr smith of the her king i don't<br>know anything about his medical<br>experiments but i know i quoted him in<br>my<br>in my fourth year long essay because he<br>said<br>any woman was liable to drop an egg at<br>his views on fertility control were<br>dependent on women's sexual excitement<br>so um you know i don't know i haven't<br>seen these pensions so i don't know<br>anything about<br>well there was a history there's been a<br>history a biography written of him but<br>the interesting thing was that he used<br>local people very much and trained them<br>as nurses to go out into all the fingers<br>of the hakianga and the maori were very<br>trusting of him as i understand so<br>um i'm interested in your lecture<br>because of the<br>holism you bought into<br>discussing the evolution of medical<br>epistemology what do you think<br>is the historical reason<br>for the current move towards<br>a more holistic version of medicine<br>complete dissatisfaction with<br>the biomedical model people feeling it<br>was insufficient so<br>that would be my there was a young<br>person up there who had a question which<br>you make it sound like well no no no i'm<br>sorry<br>i mean i'm just identifying<br>i'm full of making errors today<br>sorry kyola thank you for the wonderful<br>talk<br>um i was really interested to see dr<br>agnes bennett i was wondering how common<br>these female doctors actually were in<br>the 20s<br>agnes bennett um trained in edinburgh in<br>the 1890s she was<br>australian actually she found it very<br>difficult to set up and practice<br>when she went back to australia so it<br>was very hard for women<br>to be taken seriously as doctors<br>she a new zealand doctor resigned to get<br>married and asked her if she wanted to<br>take over her practice in wellington so<br>she came to wellington<br>for that reason i have written another<br>piece about<br>her and the woman she trained with<br>and they all write about the difficulty<br>of<br>being taken seriously and setting up in<br>practice so they're all very grateful<br>for state appointments so agnes bennett<br>becomes the medical superintendent of<br>the st<br>helens hospital and um<br>she you know she's a fine general<br>practitioner as well<br>and even in retirement she goes to the<br>chathams as a locum<br>in her 70s but there were great personal<br>costs<br>because it was impossible to be<br>married and operate as a doctor<br>in their particular era i mean it's<br>it's kind of interesting because the fir<br>you know like um<br>elizabeth garrett anderson in london one<br>of the very early<br>women doctors did marry but it becomes<br>much more difficult later<br>yeah well it's really interesting thank<br>you<br>yeah i do know about so we've been<br>talking about holism and i have to say<br>i'm noticing that the side of the room<br>is carrying the weight of the questions<br>and i'm going to come over the other<br>side and see if we've got any questions<br>over here to balance out our<br>conversation<br>good i like basic<br>kia ora um thank you that was a<br>wonderful talk um<br>my question is i was wondering is it<br>normal practice to have<br>multiple doctor advice i guess<br>so mary's gone to see a woman doctor and<br>a male doctor and i'm wondering<br>if you've come across reasons for why<br>she's done that no no no<br>she she only had called the midwife<br>oh sorry so um mary danny stewart sorry<br>well because she was able to you know<br>she could afford it<br>the fees didn't matter to her um and<br>i mean well i i didn't go into it in<br>great detail in this lecture but it was<br>absolutely fascinating<br>her desire to be kind of patronized by<br>dr herbert<br>as opposed to get realistic advice from<br>dr bennett<br>and she's even critical of bennett you<br>know all she wanted five<br>pounds you know no she didn't worry at<br>so there's these really interesting<br>gender dynamics<br>at work uh and i i would like to know<br>more about<br>um bennett's association with the bowen<br>street<br>private hospital than i do actually yeah<br>i think we're like<br>yeah jane but can we just<br>okay<br>i think with bennett i think they did it<br>together<br>yeah yeah that's why bennett had the<br>photographs<br>i must say the revelation of showing you<br>photographs of your internal organs<br>was a rather wonderful gem in the<br>archive but i think i<br>was shrieking in the hawk and reading<br>room<br>okay i think we'll take maybe one more<br>question we've got another one<br>on the side of the room i can cross back<br>over if you're<br>in the more like waitress and oh<br>right in the middle thank you very much<br>do you think it may be the fact that dr<br>hocken<br>charged fees that mothers of tim and<br>kavisham couldn't afford<br>but actually is the reason we're here<br>today celebrating the hawken collection<br>of course i mean<br>but you know one of the interesting<br>things that charlotte paul reminded me<br>of<br>is that franz finnon and his you know<br>the dispossessed of the earth<br>said you know medical men who couldn't<br>make it<br>in the uk or you know it was very<br>overcrowded the profession in the uk<br>uh at the time so when they came to the<br>colonies<br>they flourished and developed a status<br>far beyond<br>anything that would have been available<br>to them in small town<br>you know bournemouth or somewhere<br>so you know he he's giving talks to the<br>local you know about botany and you know<br>becoming a collector in a way<br>that would not have been i think opened<br>up to him<br>in provincial practice in england and i<br>mean we can all<br>we can see that in parliament too a<br>number of men become<br>politicians and medical men so they they<br>develop a status in new zealand<br>that they wouldn't have been able to<br>achieve<br>had they not been in a colonial context<br>so i just like to end by making a couple<br>of observations firstly barbara what an<br>amazing crowd that you've drawn a<br>distinguished mix of<br>council members former council members<br>academic staff students<br>former students and people from the city<br>it's just just terrific<br>can i thank the vice chancellor and<br>miranda<br>particularly miranda for eloquent uh<br>response and vice chancellor for being<br>here and opening the<br>occasion so beautifully and finally<br>could i acknowledge<br>sharon dao and the hook and staff<br>and the events team for staging a<br>wonderful event that is truly fantastic<br>that we could have the hawking lecture<br>uh this year and come together and<br>fellowship and hear these reflections<br>on a series of issues that are<br>incredibly timely<br>and also to have this opportunity to<br>celebrate hawken<br>itself so can we just end by coming<br>together and thanking barbara one last<br>time</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
