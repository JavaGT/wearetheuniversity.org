our honorary doctorate<br>elizabeth knox to give today's<br>graduation address<br>graduates family and friends<br>before i begin i'd just like to say<br>that i wouldn't be here without emeritus<br>professor bill manhire<br>when i was at university i was too vain<br>to wear my glasses<br>it was the 1980s and no one had<br>positioned spectacles as a fashion item<br>though they've managed with shoulder<br>pads and lip liners so you have to<br>wonder about their blindness to<br>opportunity<br>i preferred my own blindness and the<br>smeared<br>pastel forms of buildings and traffic on<br>kelvin parade<br>to actually recognizing my friends when<br>they were walking towards me<br>they took to signaling like airport<br>ground crew waving a plane to its spot<br>before i decided to wear my glasses the<br>glasses<br>i already had for movies though i'd only<br>put them on<br>after the lights went down nowadays<br>i never leave the house without first<br>cleaning my glasses<br>though i've been known to step out<br>without looking in a mirror and noticing<br>the dab of dried egg yolk on my<br>top lip that makes me look like one of<br>the eggs stealing weasels from the wind<br>i go out forgetting i'll be looked at<br>but having made sure i'll see as well as<br>clean spectacles allow<br>what does shameless weasel me<br>make of her that young woman whose aunt<br>might have said no one makes passes at<br>girls who wear glasses<br>but whom passes mostly turned into taz<br>from the warner brothers cartoon<br>a snarling whirlwind what to make of her<br>beautifully blundering about whispering<br>endearments at pangastump she'd mistake<br>for cats she wanted to pat<br>and hurting her friend's feelings unless<br>those friends knew her well enough<br>to greet her and semaphore<br>i want to say is this habit of<br>consciousness<br>consciousness about my appearance and<br>tolerance for losing lots of information<br>about the world<br>was a form of not taking myself<br>seriously<br>this is the meat of my speech which my<br>february brief said should be<br>light-hearted and congratulatory<br>and about which since april i've been<br>in this year strange and unnerving here<br>and terrible many other places i thought<br>i might<br>try a bit of upfront advice which is<br>all you smart and hopeful and maybe<br>simultaneously uncertain<br>and exasperated people do yourselves a<br>favor<br>of taking yourself seriously don't be<br>mocked<br>or discouraged out of it and by serious<br>i don't mean sober<br>or standing on your dignity i don't mean<br>grabs for power<br>or authority or consequence or<br>seriousness<br>is a form of display designed to cool<br>things down<br>and close the sluice gates of high<br>spirits and fun<br>what i mean is taking yourself seriously<br>as a mode of being<br>rather than a manner of acting<br>why do we make ourselves uneasy<br>wondering how we appear<br>to others how we're putting ourselves<br>across<br>as if the aim is to turn ourselves into<br>consumables<br>always being inspected and chosen<br>or not chosen it's fine to have fun<br>being<br>a looked at body but before that<br>be a consciousness carrying itself about<br>inside a body's worth of skin with<br>nerves<br>at the surface of that skin<br>you touch you're hot and cold<br>you can walk into the sea and float you<br>are<br>ears and eyes and a tongue for tasting<br>and talking<br>you're a place to stand and a place to<br>step<br>out from you're a vessel of exploration<br>on a mission of hopefully many years to<br>strange new worlds<br>there will have been times in these past<br>few years when maybe you've felt that<br>yourself as an exploratory vessel<br>your group of friends as fellow crew<br>members<br>may that continue the friendships and<br>the questing<br>or the nosing about it doesn't have to<br>be grand<br>that's taking yourself seriously<br>be the one who goes out and learns and<br>is moved and amused<br>not the one who keeps their cards close<br>to their chest<br>who doesn't venture an idea only picks<br>apart other people's ideas<br>be the one prepared to make a fool of<br>himself<br>who puts others at ease and encourages<br>openness<br>be the serious person the one who<br>listens<br>the one who laughs my heartfelt<br>thank you so much elizabeth for a<br>beautiful

the holders of the postgraduate<br>diploma in strategic studies<br>chancellor<br>traditionally each graduation ceremony<br>features an address by one of our newest<br>graduates who speaks on behalf of their<br>peers<br>this honour is awarded to someone who<br>during their time at the university<br>has exemplified the qualities we seek to<br>instill<br>in all our graduates<br>this evening's address will be given by<br>jesse tien<br>who has graduated with a bachelor of<br>education<br>in early childhood teaching<br>during her studies jesse was a recipient<br>of both a victoria<br>excellence scholarship and a teacher<br>education<br>excellence award jesse held leadership<br>roles as the president<br>and committee member of the tertiary<br>students christian<br>fellowship club and was the student<br>representative<br>for the early childhood teacher<br>education advisory committee<br>jesse is currently working as an early<br>childhood teacher<br>at the karore child space early learning<br>centre<br>and is serving as the graduate<br>representative for the early childhood<br>teacher education advisory committee<br>ladies and gentlemen please welcome<br>jesse tien<br>it is such an honor and a privilege to<br>be here tonight speaking<br>on behalf of this graduate ceremony i<br>want to start by thanking the university<br>staff and anyone else who<br>has helped pull together yet another<br>graduation ceremony<br>leading up to the ceremony i was<br>thinking oh when is this one going to<br>get cancelled too<br>but like me i'm sure many of you are<br>quite relieved that we're finally<br>managing to graduate tonight<br>now i know that i won't be able to fully<br>represent and speak on behalf of<br>everyone here<br>because our experiences at university<br>are so varied<br>and unique but with the few minutes that<br>i do have<br>what i can do is share a little<br>something about my time at university i<br>can definitely say<br>that i learnt a lot over the past few<br>years<br>bit about myself about others<br>about the depth of knowledge surrounding<br>early childhood education<br>and the various unexpected intricacies<br>that being a university student<br>brings with it it really tested my<br>patience<br>at how long i could stay at my desk<br>writing an assignment<br>which i could say the longest was eight<br>hours um i don't know how i managed that<br>because i've not been able to do that<br>ever since<br>um and sometimes testing my patients<br>with flat mates and friends<br>i was challenged in so many ways<br>i was pushed out of my comfort zone a<br>fair few times<br>even if it was me putting myself in<br>those situations<br>i remember that when we were first<br>introduced to fariki<br>our early childhood curriculum and i<br>thought that<br>these were some great values for us to<br>teach and instill in our children<br>but as i studied them deeper i learned<br>that the values<br>principles and strands that we integrate<br>and uphold in our teaching<br>don't only apply to the children that we<br>teach<br>but to us as well two of the principles<br>relationships and family and community<br>have always stood out to me<br>not only do they underpin this the<br>values and practices<br>of early childhood education but i hold<br>so strongly to them<br>because i believe them to be the<br>principles which help create<br>a solid foundation for our own lives<br>it's for this very reason that i know<br>that while i can try to do this<br>alone it just wouldn't be easy<br>it wouldn't be sustainable and this has<br>spoken<br>so true in my life and i'm sure does for<br>many of you tonight<br>the people around us form a community<br>which helps us to grow<br>in knowledge respect confidence<br>this is why i love the image of a fariki<br>or a woven match<br>as each strand is intertwined and woven<br>together<br>it creates a strong and beautiful mat<br>one that becomes hard to break and can<br>bend<br>adapt and withstand the challenges that<br>come our way<br>these strands i believe are the people<br>in our lives<br>past present and future<br>all working together whether we realize<br>it or not<br>to build us into the people we are now<br>and will become<br>in saying all this i want to say thank<br>you to my community of people<br>who have given me an overwhelming amount<br>of support<br>throughout my time at university thank<br>you to<br>my lecturers who encouraged me<br>to create and voice my opinions<br>allowed me to express and be true to<br>myself<br>thank you to my family who have always<br>supported me wherever my interests took<br>me<br>including following my passion to become<br>an early childhood teacher<br>thanks to natalie tash and jess yes you<br>guys do<br>get a shout out for our countless hours<br>spent walking around level 3 of the<br>library<br>trying to find a seat in between our<br>lectures and for an equal<br>number of hours spent doing buzzfeed<br>quizzes when<br>we probably should have been studying<br>and for all the messages about all our<br>assignments<br>thank you to my cf group<br>my old flat ronald pai special mentioned<br>to vic and alex<br>and my church family you definitely<br>brought<br>a lot of laughter in my into my life as<br>well as tears<br>but then also gave me a shoulder to cry<br>on<br>thank you for letting me tell you how<br>nervous i was about giving this speech<br>tonight<br>for the past few months i'm sure you're<br>all quite relieved that i'm finally<br>giving this speech<br>but all jokes aside you guys walked<br>alongside me through some of the<br>toughest<br>and best moments of my life and for that<br>i'm grateful and to anyone else who i<br>may have encountered<br>along my journey or shown kindness to me<br>thank you your actions and words have<br>definitely not gone unnoticed<br>i would like to finish with the<br>whakatoki one that is quite special to<br>me<br>and i
