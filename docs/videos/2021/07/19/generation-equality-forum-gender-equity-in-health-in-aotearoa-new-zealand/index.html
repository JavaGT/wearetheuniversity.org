The GEF is a global gathering for gender equality, convened by UN Women and co-chaired by France and Mexico, in partnership with civil society and youth.<br><br>This event was designed to spark conversations and catalyse collective action on improving gender equity in the health and care workforce. A number action points have been carried forward as a result of this discussion. <br><br>The panel was made up of inspiring women leaders in New Zealand and Pacific health to share combined knowledge and experience:<br> <br>Debbie Sorensen NZRPN MNZIOD - CEO, Pacific Medical Association<br>Gerardine Clifford-Lidstone - Director, Pacific Health, Ministry of Health<br>Anjana Naidu - Associate Director of Nursing, Capital & Coast District Health Board<br>Tania Mullane - Head of Pacific Nursing, Whitireia<br><br>Moderator: Loretta Elive-Daunakamakama (Awesome Women Network)<br> <br>COVID-19 has exacerbated existing gender inequities, with reports of rising violence against women, as well as higher adverse economic impacts caused both by increased unpaid care-giving and the fact that women work in more insecure, low-paid and informal jobs. Women of colour, indigenous women and youth face compounded risks and barriers. <br><br>We are living through a gender equality crisis, and the Generation Equality Forum offers a critical opportunity

sorry to have<br>jumped a little bit earlier<br>on that exercise and i just was saying<br>that i would like to be brief in order<br>to leave more time<br>to the panel and all the<br>wonderful people taking part in this<br>panel<br>um and i was also saying that since<br>um beijing um the<br>um the situation is that<br>not any country in the world has<br>achieved<br>equality between men and women<br>and so it is absolutely vital<br>for us to ensure that the conversation<br>carries on<br>um since the last years<br>and that we keep building on the legacy<br>of the beijing declaration<br>in order to stamp out the discrimination<br>against<br>women and achieve equality<br>and this is where the forum generation<br>equality<br>comes in 25 years after beijing<br>a wish with mexico who are<br>who is also co-chairing that event<br>is that international organizations<br>civil society private sector<br>youth movements like yours<br>are mobilizing once again um<br>to to ensure action accountability<br>and to achieve<br>tangible progress because this is what<br>is the more important that we have<br>something<br>really concrete so the forum opened last<br>march in mexico um presided by the<br>president of mexico<br>uh city and it's currently taking place<br>in paris<br>loretta it started yesterday<br>and until the second of july um<br>it will be um it will be organized with<br>a series of<br>uh events online like today<br>unfortunately we had planned to organize<br>the event in paris but we had<br>like here to shift to a virtual<br>exercise but the important point is that<br>it is widely open<br>to civil society i would just quote a<br>few words said by president macron<br>in opening that um conference well that<br>forum<br>um yesterday night in fact<br>he said that through forum generation<br>equality<br>francis objective is to state loud and<br>clear<br>that the rights of women and girls are<br>universal<br>and as are all human rights<br>everywhere have to be respected<br>everywhere all the<br>time the union secretary general himself<br>said that the forum was a moment to<br>readdress global<br>concern with activists policy makers<br>and leaders across all ages<br>shaping our world into a<br>more just and gender<br>and what i would like to add maybe in<br>the context here of the pacific is that<br>in this unprecedented uh pandemic of<br>convent 19<br>not only in the pacific but especially<br>here and in the rest of the world<br>women have been strongly impacted<br>in terms of inequalities family violence<br>and economic capabilities it's always on<br>women that<br>this kind of problem unfortunately<br>raised and therefore it is<br>very important and more than ever<br>to acknowledge that women have a<br>huge contribution to society they are at<br>the root at the heart of society<br>and they have to be supported so<br>today we will you will<br>loretta and and the panel will be<br>focusing<br>on the healthcare sector a very<br>very very uh important one for women<br>women and children because that's the<br>continuum<br>that's where women are really at the<br>heart of society<br>and i'm happy that we will hear from<br>the panel of women leaders with<br>extensive experience in that field so<br>i'm sure you'll have a<br>very very very thorough discussions<br>and i would before stopping there<br>because again i think it is what you<br>will say which<br>will be important uh to thank<br>very very sincerely also from the bottom<br>of my heart<br>the awesome women network<br>and in particular you loretta<br>we

bravo who will<br>be giving his address as to his thoughts<br>and<br>bonjour good morning buenos dias<br>i would like to thank to thank first<br>loretta for<br>the introduction and for the work you<br>have been doing<br>with everybody in this seminar uh<br>i of course would like to say thank you<br>very much mexiboku<br>to the ambassador of france is who has<br>been very active<br>in this regard but she's one of the most<br>amazing diplomats i ever met in in my<br>career<br>but she did a wonderful job for this<br>seminar<br>and i want to thank the university of<br>victoria for the<br>taking the lead in this<br>very important subject for us and of<br>course to the speakers<br>of this morning uh well<br>the ambassador and carter alleviate<br>mentioned most of the important things<br>about the seminar<br>just let me add that<br>mexico was leading also<br>in this subject when we host the very<br>important<br>first international conference on women<br>uh maybe you read about that i don't<br>think you were there because that was a<br>long time ago and you're very young<br>people<br>but 1975 by the way was my first job in<br>the ministry of foreign affairs<br>was the international conference on<br>women<br>and then we have to wait 20 years until<br>1995<br>in the beijing conference that was the<br>fourth conference<br>to start to have a uh guidelines in the<br>in this important matter with the<br>beijing platform of action<br>but frankly speaking as the ambassador<br>of france just mentioned<br>very few things happened and we had to<br>wait another 26 years<br>until france and mexico took the<br>initiative<br>to host and to organize<br>this very important forum of<br>generation equality and health<br>the forum has been divided into parts<br>and the first part<br>was already in march in mexico city<br>the forum of mexico and that was<br>a very good opportunity because one of<br>the most<br>important things that we<br>in the in the forum of mexico is that<br>the pandemic<br>the covet create a a a<br>worse situation for women girls<br>and it was really<br>something that shocked us<br>in in many in many regards uh<br>in mexico a forum<br>we have to say that it was create the<br>momentum to<br>mobilize mobilize the the people<br>mobilize the the organizations and the<br>governments<br>around this extremely important subject<br>of women<br>it was a big success the forum of mexico<br>because we have<br>91 government representatives of around<br>the world<br>and there were 250 speakers<br>in the forum so we learned a lot of<br>things<br>we got a lot of information and uh<br>i have to say that the main result of<br>the forum of mexico<br>was the global acceleration plan plan<br>for<br>gender and this plan has<br>several pillars several<br>areas where divided by subjects<br>now in the form of parties are going to<br>be review<br>and take some actions or propose actions<br>or lines of actions so that's<br>that's a i'm very happy to hear that<br>the forum in paris is already there and<br>this is a very successful activity<br>co-host by france and mexico just to<br>finish<br>allowed me to recognize the role of<br>france in<br>of one of the leaders countries in the<br>world<br>addressing this important matter and<br>mexico is extremely happy<br>uh to associate with france<br>and organize this forum and now<br>thanks

more important role in<br>this subject<br>around the world so we really invite you<br>we really want to see new zealand<br>important actors social economic<br>political actors of this

it over to you<br>to for your core and to share with<br>others<br>thank you tanya and thank you everyone<br>for for um the privilege of of being<br>here today for being<br>asked to be part of this um<br>animal uh i was just saying earlier that<br>it comes with a little bit of um<br>you know humbleness and a little bit of<br>excitement<br>but a little bit of anxiety as well you<br>know do we want to pitch it right and<br>want to get it right<br>um so so thank you for for um<br>letting me align me to be part of the<br>panel um<br>so nissan bullavinaka is tanya duncan<br>and i did currently in the role of<br>associate director of nursing workforce<br>development for capital<br>coast district health board here in<br>wellington um<br>you probably have gathered that i come<br>from fiji that's where i originate from<br>and uh i completed my bachelor of<br>nursing degree in australia<br>and then returned to fiji to work in<br>lotoca hospital<br>for two years and what a journey that<br>was<br>um but i want to to<br>uh you know situate myself and<br>talk about my personal uh background in<br>my journey because i think<br>it's important in the way that it has<br>brought me to where<br>i currently am so uh<br>i moved to australia to complete my<br>higher studies<br>um and i lived with my sisters and we<br>were<br>all aged between uh 17 and uh<br>seven years of age when we were living<br>in australia without our parents because<br>um<br>that's the way uh education was<br>important so that's where we went uh<br>with our journey<br>um it was uh at the time uh that things<br>in fiji were um a little bit unrest<br>um and so that that was the decision<br>that was made<br>um for those who who come from fiji i<br>completed my primary<br>in high school at jesper williams high<br>school and this may not sound important<br>for people who are not from fiji<br>but these schools are all girls schools<br>um in fiji and this is where<br>um as a female as<br>a woman growing up or a youngster<br>growing up<br>i um i learned that girls can do<br>anything<br>anything that they put their minds to<br>this is also where<br>i found my voice many would say<br>that i could provide an opinion on just<br>about anything<br>however when you think about it it is<br>also called leadership abilities so<br>this was the foundation for me growing<br>up around a lot of women<br>a lot of strong women and um<br>you know you're in your finding years or<br>as you're growing up you're you're<br>wanting to<br>to navigate the system and you want to<br>see<br>uh who you are and surrounded by women<br>strong women educated women um<br>it was it was quite remarkable i think<br>and and<br>integral um to my journey<br>um so how i entered the the health<br>profession when i lived um<br>i lived with my grandmother for a period<br>of time<br>um growing up and um it was my<br>responsibility<br>to look after her when she broke both<br>her arms<br>um and she she was a diabetic as well<br>a type one diabetic that required<br>insulin so<br>it was my responsibility and it was very<br>um at that time very old school<br>uh equipment that she used so you had to<br>boil her<br>uh her needle and her uh you know<br>syringe and all of that and that was<br>part of the process of of giving her<br>her medication back home so um you know<br>i i used to help her with that not<br>thinking that that's what i wanted to do<br>and nursing wasn't<br>uh what i wanted to do at the time but<br>as<br>i went into high school and i was<br>completing my studies in australia<br>uh we had um you know<br>different people talk about their<br>careers and<br>part of that career uh conversation was<br>from a nurse<br>and i thought gosh i do all of these<br>things at home maybe<br>maybe this is something i could do so i<br>looked a little bit<br>uh more into nursing as part of them<br>because<br>you know by in my head nurses give<br>injections and i was doing it at home so<br>maybe<br>i could do that and that would be my<br>career anyway it was<br>longer than that um so but one of the<br>things that was really important growing<br>up<br>is that uh my mom always said that<br>education was the<br>only way um that we would get out of the<br>situation that that we were in<br>so so education was massively valued by<br>my parents<br>and it hugely influenced my my nursing<br>journey and<br>my career as well um<br>uh so for me uh i i have a family<br>of uh i grew up in a family of uh four<br>girls<br>um and education provided that<br>that power to change the circumstances<br>that we were in growing up it provided<br>us with<br>choices um that we might may not have<br>had<br>and it also provided us with with<br>opportunities<br>and that that was really uh<br>how i i got started in the main driver<br>uh for entering the the health<br>profession and i do<br>have to thank my grandmother a lot for<br>that<br>um after completing my degree in<br>australia i returned to fiji<br>and um my clinical work in fiji gave me<br>great foundational nursing skills um in<br>a different<br>lot of uh clinical settings so<br>it was quite different to being an<br>australian here in new zealand<br>in fiji the matron decides which ward<br>and which<br>area you will practice in depending on<br>staffing levels<br>and um depend and that person decides<br>how long you will stay in that area so<br>you might want to work in<br>say for instance in a surgical area but<br>the the need at that time<br>was ed and pediatrics so i spent a lot<br>of time<br>working in emergency department in fiji<br>um peds i did medical surgical<br>um and icu areas as well because um<br>it you moved where the need was and um<br>when i look at the health system in new<br>zealand sometimes i wish you know<br>that's something that we could use here<br>as well to be moved around but<br>you know it comes with a lot of anxiety<br>and just different health systems i<br>suppose<br>um the movement around the hospital<br>was a great opportunity to navigate the<br>health system it's<br>it's great for meeting other nurses<br>across the healthcare setting<br>um you also learn to appreciate the<br>skills and<br>knowledge and the strengths that other<br>nurses bring so<br>my perspective on this uh today<br>is is about um a lot coming from nursing<br>um in the healthcare and about women but<br>also a little bit about my journey as<br>well<br>anyway so um spending a lot of time<br>across different health<br>settings i learned a lot about using and<br>sharing the<br>the limited resources that we had in<br>fiji<br>from equipment or knowledge and skills<br>or<br>just moving around um after after that<br>period<br>um in fiji i moved to new zealand and<br>that was about<br>24 years ago so uh in in preparation for<br>that i had to do some counting i thought<br>gosh it doesn't feel like i've been here<br>for<br>um you know that long but it it has been<br>um quite quite a long period yeah so my<br>areas as tony alluded to his cardiology<br>cardio syracuse<br>became my passion because the the<br>hospital that i<br>initially worked in there was a<br>insurance scheme in fiji<br>where a lot of fijians could come to new<br>zealand<br>for cardiology and cardiothoracic<br>interventions<br>because those were not available in fiji<br>at that time so<br>i still got to work with a lot of my<br>people um<br>but but in a hospital in new zealand and<br>that<br>that was really helpful uh for me and in<br>my journey<br>um however when i was working clinically<br>i felt like i didn't know enough um some<br>days i felt like i didn't know anything<br>but um so i started i started thinking<br>about<br>okay having a a bachelor's degree<br>probably was just the start to to the<br>journey<br>and i needed to learn more um in order<br>to look after my patients well<br>and and to care for them in a in the<br>technical work<br>world that was changing quite rapidly um<br>so i started my<br>my postgraduate journey i i started with<br>um<br>i thought what was a very difficult<br>paper which was pathophysiology<br>at messi and at that time not very many<br>nurses were studying in the hospital<br>that i<br>certainly worked in but i thought okay<br>this would<br>give me the things that that i need in<br>order to<br>safely uh look after to after the<br>patients<br>um in my care so i<br>i continued my postgraduate journey as i<br>wanted to also be an educator<br>and i realized that talking to different<br>people<br>what i um if i wanted to teach at a<br>university or a polytechnic<br>i needed to have a master's<br>qualification so i thought okay<br>well i've started a few papers i might<br>as well uh continue with<br>with the journey so i went<br>to find out more about teaching roles<br>because that's what i wanted to do<br>and um i found that my values and<br>and beliefs align very closely with<br>futile which is a tertiary education<br>provider<br>and i love the way that they supported<br>undergraduate students<br>in part of their journey in their<br>nursing education<br>and a majority of um or there was<br>significant amount<br>of um pacific nurses involved and and<br>students who were involved<br>in part of their journey and so um<br>it just you know felt like the right fit<br>for me<br>um it is here that i learned so much<br>about myself<br>about teaching about equity and<br>workforce development<br>and for me creating creating teachable<br>moments in practice was<br>exciting as it was linking theory to<br>practice<br>and it was about developing the next um<br>nursing<br>uh workforce and and the generation so i<br>thought okay this is what i want to do<br>although i thought i went to into<br>education to just<br>um you know teach about heart and lungs<br>because that's all i thought i knew<br>um first i when i got to today is i<br>learned<br>about how to teach how to engage a large<br>crowd of students um and this challenged<br>my world and my perspective about<br>teaching and learning um and its<br>application to the the clinical<br>environment as well they shouldn't be<br>so distant from each other that there is<br>a significant gap about<br>from what we learn and how we apply to<br>practice so that became my passion<br>and the drive between uh and then the<br>drive<br>uh for you know the clinical and<br>bringing together the clinical into the<br>um into the classroom um<br>so i think it is really important that<br>you find your passion<br>it's important to know your values it's<br>important to know what drives you and in<br>your chosen area of work<br>and for me that was nursing but when<br>these align<br>your passion and your values and what<br>you're doing it brings the best out in<br>you<br>and also in the service that you're<br>providing<br>so it is important to me to ensure that<br>that you make all opportunities count<br>so knowing yourself and what value<br>is important in as part of your<br>leadership journey as well<br>um after today there was an opportunity<br>here<br>at capitol coast district health board<br>to<br>be a nurse lecturer for a new graduate<br>program<br>and it was fairly new they wanted<br>somebody to come in<br>support the student learning but also to<br>embed a postgraduate education<br>um as part of the the new graduate<br>program<br>and that was the thing that um a<br>you know helped me move from fativa to<br>ccdhb federer is very cocooned it was a<br>great<br>place to teach and grow and um but<br>you know coming to ccdhb you learned<br>what health system is and how you fit<br>into this<br>but for me i was bringing the strengths<br>that i had learned around<br>teaching and education and bringing that<br>again into<br>into the clinical area and working with<br>the new graduates which was um<br>quite exciting um being here working in<br>a large<br>uh clinical environment you have to know<br>what<br>battles to fight um the the what<br>tanya said about being favorite or being<br>a fighter really resonates<br>um so knowing what battles to fight and<br>there are some things<br>that are not fighting for but but they<br>are others that<br>that are not negotiable and and as part<br>of your own development<br>you need to choose when when you need<br>to fight and when to let things go<br>because that's been also part of the<br>the learning here and and part of of my<br>journey<br>um some of uh what i want to talk about<br>is the next is uh so what are the<br>some of the key health um gender<br>in uh inequalities affecting pacific<br>communities<br>um in in new zealand and from a health<br>workforce perspective because that's<br>going to be what i'm going to talk about<br>um the key health-related gender<br>inequalities<br>affecting pacific communities that i<br>will talk about today is<br>health workforce um education and<br>and leadership so um a little bit of<br>background regarding uh<br>and putting things into context in new<br>zealand<br>health workforce forecast stated that<br>the most significant<br>change facing the new zealand labor<br>market over the next 25 years<br>would be that more many more workers<br>will retire<br>then they will be recruited in addition<br>uh projections in 2006 um suggested that<br>maori and pacific people<br>will make up a greater proportion of the<br>workforce<br>and um you know years later<br>um in the recent health and disability<br>system review<br>which some of you might be familiar with<br>and the same notion continues about<br>workforce development<br>as a key limitation in our current<br>health and disability system<br>and it's in line with the worldwide<br>trends but<br>new zealand is experiencing growing<br>clinical<br>workforce um shortages so i'm not here<br>to talk about<br>recruiting um nurses to to ccdhb<br>although<br>it might sound like that a little bit<br>but i i am here to talk about<br>workforce in the way that one of the<br>recommendations of the health and<br>disability system review is that<br>maori health providers develop<br>strategies to ensure that appropriate<br>maori workforce<br>and the range of services to meet in<br>health and disability<br>needs of maori whanau and communities<br>and and also about increasing the<br>provision for<br>maori providers to to employ uh<br>the maori workforce in in the same line<br>and similar sort of thing our pacific<br>population is growing<br>and this needs to enhance our focus on<br>this population<br>of workforce so currently<br>at captain coast district health board<br>our population of pacific<br>patients do not represent the pacific<br>workforce<br>that should be you know that should be<br>part of the workforce<br>or if they are part of the workforce<br>they are not in the roles<br>um that we would like uh them to be<br>where they can make<br>a difference to population health so in<br>relation to health<br>females make a majority of the current<br>workforce in nursing<br>when i say nursing um this includes<br>healthcare assistant enrolled nurses<br>and and registered nurses and as nurses<br>we make a difference in the health<br>outcomes<br>of of the population including<br>maori and pacific population most<br>if not all published documents and<br>research<br>say that the workforce needs to reflect<br>the population<br>population we serve however that is not<br>a reality so as specific women<br>are we focusing on the development of<br>our own health<br>of education and for leadership<br>as well you know so it needs to start<br>for us<br>quite further back in the way that um<br>the young pacific women are they taking<br>the right subjects at school so that if<br>they are choosing<br>a career say for instance in health care<br>um they are able to get into that into<br>that field if that's where they're<br>wanting to be<br>are we able to staircase education<br>um and get into the roles in health that<br>they want for example<br>um we don't all have to start with a<br>degree program because<br>if that's not what we're wanting to do<br>or the support's not there<br>there's opportunity to start at a level<br>3 nz qa course and still be part of the<br>the health workforce by completing the<br>health and well-being course at level<br>three<br>and starting your journey in the health<br>in the health workforce around that or<br>and it is a free course at the moment so<br>um you know do pacific young pacific<br>people know about that that is a free<br>course that is available<br>to them as as part of their journey<br>um the other programs that are<br>free at the moment as well is the<br>enrolled nursing program<br>um that you can do it for today but you<br>can do it at other<br>um tertiary education providers across<br>new zealand it doesn't have to be just<br>here in wellington<br>and of course there are bachelor of<br>nursing programs<br>and the bn pacific and the bien maori<br>locally um you know those scholarships<br>are awarded<br>for these courses as well that you can<br>be partaking in<br>um so these are about qualifications and<br>about workforce and well why are<br>qualifications important are they<br>important<br>um because for ministry of health and<br>other organizations<br>they use the qualification to say that<br>this person has achieved<br>and report to the qualification and<br>under the pay equity<br>settlement um uh information for<br>employees on the website um it does say<br>that<br>um there needs to be evidence of the<br>qualification<br>so that the you know you can apply for<br>the standards to achieve<br>um and that needs to be by accredited<br>organization<br>so having a big picture and knowing<br>where you are navigating and where you<br>are going<br>is part of the the development and<br>sharing those resources and and<br>providing these um<br>networking uh uh platforms is is so<br>important and truly appreciative and<br>and thankful the wall more we know of<br>what is be what is available and what we<br>are using<br>the better we will be in supporting<br>people that we need to say well this is<br>available and this is free at the moment<br>why don't you use this opportunity<br>so so my take on that is challenge<br>yourself<br>move out of the comfort zone to make a<br>start<br>because as women and<br>in in health care you can make a<br>significant difference<br>and tooled tool that with education<br>because it provides us<br>with choices and i think that you have<br>to be<br>in the system in healthcare to navigate<br>the system<br>and and to change the system it's hard<br>looking<br>um from outside in and saying that there<br>are many challenges and there are many<br>challenges<br>but if you're in the system you can be<br>part of the solution as well<br>so education will get you into the<br>health system<br>um as part of the workforce so that you<br>are able to<br>navigate um the system and sometimes not<br>just for yourself but for your family<br>and far now<br>um sorry sorry to interrupt<br>um that's your that's your time okay<br>um i just just wanna um we've got<br>time for questions um after everyone's<br>presented<br>um but um thank you so much for your<br>presentation<br>and yes you certainly don't have to<br>attend every fight that you're<br>you're invited to but there are some<br>fights that you do<br>have to attend and certainly as we all<br>go along in our career we<br>we become a bit more um adaptable about<br>deciding which one of those we're going<br>to attend and which one we're not<br>we have got time everybody for questions<br>after so if you want to<br>put some questions in the chat um i've<br>certainly got some<br>um and um once again um<br>for your presentation um i will<br>introduce our next um speaker<br>uh this is geradine clifford<br>lidstone she is the director of pacific<br>health at the ministry of health<br>and she's worked in health and social<br>welcome and i will hand over to you<br>to to let us know more about your<br>thank you so much for the opportunity to<br>talk to you all today<br>um firstly i'd like to acknowledge your<br>excellencies<br>um the participants but in particular<br>my fellow panelists um debbie sorensen<br>who joins me<br>today um over the past few weeks as i've<br>been thinking about the inequalities and<br>challenges that women in health face<br>i've often thought of debbie because<br>when you see her in action she's quite<br>amazing<br>and she never conforms to the<br>stereotypes and i know that this will<br>come at a cost to her and your whanau<br>so i consider it a real honor to be on<br>the panel<br>with her today and thank you also anjana<br>for your<br>contribution um so i have 15 minutes to<br>cover the brief and i was<br>given around starting with my personal<br>background and i realized that i've<br>now reached an age where it's quite<br>difficult to do that in 15 minutes<br>however i will attempt<br>um and so from the outset i think that<br>as a pacific woman<br>it is very difficult for me to separate<br>out my gender from my ethnicity<br>and the experiences of gender and<br>equality and racism go hand in hand for<br>me<br>so please understand if i use these<br>experiences<br>interchangeably also i try really hard<br>to be my authentic self so<br>can i apologize in advance for any use<br>of colorful language<br>as i share my experiences because i'm<br>just a colorful person<br>and when i was thinking about this i was<br>trying to think back to my earliest<br>memories of<br>being aware of my specificness and of my<br>womanhood<br>because i think that these formative<br>experiences really start to identify<br>your identity and your personality<br>and the earliest memory i have<br>was when my older sister and i used to<br>walk home from school together and i was<br>five and we used to walk past this<br>butcher who was greek and he would come<br>out as we pass<br>and make a big fuss over my sister who<br>was much finer featured than me<br>taken after our australian italian<br>father<br>and he would say oh beautiful greek girl<br>beautiful greek girl<br>and then you'd give her a saveloy and<br>totally ignore me<br>and so we'd split the saboloi on the way<br>home but man did i want my own savoloy<br>anyway this would happen like two to<br>three times a week you'd give her a<br>saballoy and give me nothing<br>and i you know i think what a strict guy<br>i've seen photos of me when i was five<br>and i was pretty damn cute too i was a<br>cute island child<br>and i deserve my own savily so did i<br>feel sorry for myself<br>oh how yes i do did feel sorry for<br>myself and i still feel sorry for myself<br>anyway a few months after this one day i<br>went to kauri woolworths with my mother<br>and as i walked past the bins of lollies<br>and for those of you that are old enough<br>to remember that you have these big bins<br>of um pick and mix lollies and it was<br>like roses chocolates they were really<br>bright and colorful<br>and so while my mum was shopping i stood<br>there and i ate all the chocolates<br>i wasn't trying to hide i just learned<br>that no one was going to give me<br>anything<br>if i didn't take my chances so much to<br>my mum's horror<br>they called the police on us and i was<br>done for shoplifting<br>it must have been a terrible experience<br>for her so<br>but the point is that not only was i a<br>cute five-year-old<br>i was also full of badassery so i was a<br>badass five-year-old<br>and so i had so many of these<br>experiences through my early years<br>i think of my neighbour and dane who<br>used to call me boomer girl from<br>boomerland and girl every day<br>and i didn't know what a bunga or a<br> was but i actually thought they<br>sounded like really cool words<br>so until i went home and i called up to<br>my brother and said hey grant<br>boy and i admired my ability to join the<br>two words together i thought that was<br>pretty intelligent<br>and my parents heard and went completely<br>nuts<br>and that's what i when i found out what<br>it meant<br>so the next day well all i can say is<br>poor dane<br>but subconsciously what what happened is<br>that<br>it came clear to me that teachers<br>community my peers the students that i<br>went to school with<br>they didn't really have any hope for me<br>and so in my schooling i walked a very<br>fine line of being totally disengaged<br>and rebellious<br>while doing enough for my parents not to<br>find out<br>so and this is kind of like the start of<br>a splitting of personality where you<br>become two different people and<br>sometimes three or four different people<br>and it's really easy to do when you<br>realize that people don't have much hope<br>these things is what we now know as<br>microaggressions and the definition of a<br>microaggression is daily verbal<br>behavioral environment or environmental<br>slides<br>whether intentional or unintentional<br>that communicate hostile<br>derogatory or negative attitudes towards<br>stigmatized<br>or culturally marginalized groups that's<br>the<br>definition that was on google um<br>anyway so and i think about some of the<br>experiences and the examples and<br>um i remember one guy in the office<br>saying to me oh don't read the<br>organizational strategy jared and that's<br>far too comprehensive<br>for someone like you i didn't really<br>know what someone like me was<br>whether it's brown or a woman or<br>you speak english really well can your<br>parents speak english too<br>or going to the christmas function and<br>someone's saying to me oh the chief<br>executives like girls like you serving<br>them<br>so can you wear a black skirt and a<br>white shoe when you come<br>or we've got you down to do the karangan<br>because there's no maoris in the team<br>and it's like um this didn't occur to me<br>as a microaggression this was just life<br>this is just how you were treated how<br>you<br>how you were raised and so this is the<br>backdrop<br>of my entry into the health sector which<br>was more like a morphing<br>rather than a conscious shift um my<br>parents started a<br>ngo in puerto rico trust<br>and they used emotional blackmail to<br>come to entice me to come and work with<br>them<br>um essentially they said if you use a<br>scholarship for pacific people<br>you need to come back and give back to<br>your community so i took<br>one year's leave without pay and i went<br>and worked in what was essentially a<br>social service provider<br>but it morphed into a health provider<br>through the problem gambling family<br>violence and alcohol and drug services<br>that it<br>provided and working in an ngo<br>really just gives you so much depth a<br>lot of my<br>peers said to me oh you're leaving a<br>real job to go and work there<br>but it fast tracked my confidence<br>and my exposure because i was dealing<br>with ministers right<br>through to community and you can't<br>that is such a huge amazing grounding to<br>have<br>so when i think now about the challenges<br>and<br>inequalities for pacific women and<br>health<br>in the health system i have to draw on<br>my own experience<br>as a patient and so seven years ago i<br>was diagnosed with metastatic breast<br>cancer<br>and as a consequence of that to this day<br>i get receptive intravenously every<br>three weeks and to get to that point of<br>diagnosis i went to the gp<br>three times i had two mammograms i had<br>three ultrasounds<br>and it took five months from the onset<br>of symptoms<br>my first doctor's visit to the point of<br>diagnosis<br>and at that diagnosis i was told that i<br>had<br>an aggressive aggressive breast cancer<br>that it had<br>spread secondary speed to my sternum<br>and it was now incurable so essentially<br>i was given a terminal diagnosis<br>this is what the clinicians define as a<br>terminal diagnosis that can't be cured<br>and so like a lot of cancer as we know<br>earlier diagnosis gives you better<br>outcomes<br>it's pretty hard not to be pissed off<br>when you know you've been seeking<br>a solution for five months and you get<br>told<br>that if you've been identified as with<br>this illness five months earlier<br>your chances of survival would be better<br>and i had two young kids and i was just<br>like<br>life is not fair um<br>right through that diagnosis diagnostic<br>period<br>i kept being told that my risk factors<br>were low and that i don't warrant<br>urgent investigation because i had no<br>history of breast cancer in my family<br>i had children and i had breastfed them<br>in my age i was under 45<br>but what i now know is the only risk<br>factor<br>that they needed to consider to warrant<br>urgent investigation is that i am a<br>woman and that i am pacific<br>those are the two things that would have<br>warranted urgent<br>intervention because the data and<br>statistics tells us<br>that these are really things that you<br>need to look out for<br>so unfortunately the health system is<br>only as good<br>as you are at advocating for yourself<br>and this is the reason why<br>i think it's broken realizing my<br>mortality<br>is why i now try to um really be my<br>authentic self<br>and to bring back together that person<br>that split excuse me<br>two to three to four times when i was at<br>school<br>partly because this is part of my<br>healing but also because<br>the full person is so much more amazing<br>than the<br>the separated out person i actually feel<br>sorry for people that come across me now<br>because<br>of the level of um i just like<br>put up with that i used to put up<br>with in the past<br>so how has covert affected this<br>well it just exacerbates the inequities<br>that are already there and it compounds<br>the multiple disadvantages that restrict<br>access to health for women and i can't<br>go much further without acknowledging<br>um the pacific health workforce their<br>response to covert 19 has been<br>phenomenal<br>and at the leading edge of that response<br>has been some phenomenal woman<br>thanks tanya pacific nurses on the front<br>line<br>looking after early covert cases who<br>didn't go home for four weeks during<br>lockdown because they lived in<br>intergenerational households with aged<br>parents<br>and young children who they wanted to<br>protect<br>single mums single pacific moms in<br>senior executive roles who were<br>simultaneously leading the covert<br>response<br>while supervising and home schooling<br>their children<br>community support workers standing out<br>in the pouring rain<br>doing welfare support assessments and<br>door knocking to find people<br>when the contact tracing system couldn't<br>find them<br>these are the heroes of the covert<br>response<br>yet the gender pay gap for pacific woman<br>and health<br>my back of the envelope working out<br>equates it to about<br>18 700 less per annum<br>so i've been at the ministry for nearly<br>18 months and now i'm on to my fourth<br>executive assistant and when you turn<br>over that many executive assistants in<br>such a short period of time you have to<br>start asking yourself whether there's<br>some kind of underlying pathological<br>behavior that makes you a difficult<br>person to work with<br>and i now have a very experienced<br>ea who has worked with first-tier and<br>second-tier<br>executives and she is astounded at the<br>broad nature of the work that i'm<br>dealing with and the hours that i put in<br>and she says to me in her experience<br>that the level of intensity is next<br>level<br>so i'm really relieved to know that i'm<br>not a psycho and that the research says<br>that a lot of women and women of color<br>no less<br>pay this performance tax where we<br>perform at a higher level<br>we manage a higher degree of complexity<br>and hold a huge workload for little or<br>no<br>return and less wages than our male<br>counterparts<br>so um ministry of education did<br>some research into 15 year old pacific<br>girls and they looked at the top 10<br>careers<br>number one on that list nurses and<br>midwives this is what they want to be<br>number four on the list doctors and we<br>have to do better for them<br>i was recently reading an article by a<br>woman of color who was trained to be a<br>physician in america<br>and she wanted to work with your own<br>community and observe that<br>they were only taught to diagnose<br>conditions on white patients<br>and that the cpr mannequins are in the<br>form of a white male<br>when this is not typically the form of<br>those that need the medical intervention<br>or the form of the woman that she would<br>be dealing with<br>so um noting the time<br>i guess what i want to say is i hope<br>i've drawn a really compelling picture<br>about why you would want to work in<br>health there's<br>lots to fix there's lots to contribute<br>to<br>and you can make a difference but most<br>of all<br>i get to work with some of the smartest<br>women in the country<br>the smartest pacific woman and they are<br>amazing<br>people like debbie and anjana and tanya<br>who are the antithesis of these<br>microaggressions<br>so i'd like to close by just saying<br>thank you to costa the butcher for<br>teaching me resilience<br>at a young age and i'd like to high five<br>my five-year-old self<br>for eating the damn chocolates without<br>any regard for the consequences because<br>i was sticking it to the man<br>and then finally for julia who asked did<br>i do some interpretive dance<br>um and i bet those chocolates tasted<br>really good because the chocolates they<br>make these days even the roses certainly<br>don't taste the same<br>uh so it does does take take us back to<br>those 70s which we will acknowledge that<br>maybe we were born then<br>um i'd i'd just like to also um<br>acknowledge that um anjana and geradine<br>i've worked closely with to support<br>pacific and maori workforce<br>since my short time here and certainly<br>some of those um<br>those gains are already um being shown<br>um and our graduates and also future<br>projects that are that are<br>um being discussed so really exciting<br>time um with all the opportunities<br>um that have been presented um for for<br>multiple<br>um reasons so cure to geradine for um<br>for sharing your your life and your<br>lived experience<br>um remember everybody you can put<br>questions um into the chat we do have<br>time after this after our next speaker<br>our next speaker is um debbie um<br>debbie sorensen and who has been<br>instrumental in the development<br>of pacific health sector in aotearoa<br>and the region she has demonstrated<br>leadership through her appointment to a<br>number of key roles<br>which have been described as first she's<br>been the first<br>chief advisor pacific health at the<br>ministry of health<br>the first general manager of pacific<br>health at countess monaco<br>district health board and the first ceo<br>of the pacific<br>whanau order commissioning agency for<br>pacific families in aotearoa<br>significant roles debbie you bring with<br>you a real legacy<br>and who better to talk about<br>you than you and share with us your<br>experiences<br>dias your excellencies um can i<br>recognize my sister panelists<br>uh loretta and niari for the kind and<br>generous invitation<br>and jaredine you're way too kind to me<br>and we have way too much fun<br>in a sector that is often full of too<br>much pain<br>um i wanted to start really talking<br>about<br>you know 40 years ago i graduated as a<br>nurse<br>and they were obviously much shorter<br>years because i'm really not that old<br>well i don't feel that old and i didn't<br>have any lifelong learning desire to<br>care for people<br>the truth was i didn't have a job and i<br>needed to leave home<br>and so becoming an old-fashioned<br>nurse meant that i moved into a nursing<br>home<br>it meant i had a roof over my head and i<br>got fed three meals a day when i was<br>working<br>and i had colleagues and friends that<br>became lifelong<br>friends while i learnt my trade<br>hands-on and awards and were taken out<br>you know for three months at a time to<br>do<br>our academic training<br>those days were very interesting and my<br>first um<br>real experience of<br>overt racism and overt sexism<br>one of the bosses in the hospital was a<br>male nurse<br>and he was a um he was a charge nurse<br>and he told me on my very first three<br>months that i was there<br>that he liked the way that i walked<br>and therefore i would get a good mark<br>for my clinical placement<br>i was incredibly grateful for the good<br>mark but i was really offended<br>by the way that i walked and i wasn't<br>quite sure whether he meant that was a<br>good thing or it was a bad thing and i<br>was forever confused by that i was young<br>remembered then that it wasn't a good<br>thing to be a pacific woman and in fact<br>i worked with a pacific nurse and we<br>never discussed being pacific women<br>we never referred to our ethnicity or<br>our background we just wanted to blend<br>in<br>we wanted to be like everyone else and<br>it was many years later<br>that i became brave enough to stand up<br>and say who i was<br>and where i came from and to hold that<br>proudly<br>it wasn't okay to be brown it was seen<br>that you weren't good enough<br>and many many times in my career in the<br>health sector over 40 years<br>i heard managers clinical leaders<br>health sector bosses ministers<br>talk about pacific doctors pacific<br>nurses specific health workers<br>as being second class has not been good<br>enough<br>and there's not to be deserving<br>of being in the workforce it's a real<br>tough gay gay<br>help it's a real tough gig so i started<br>off you know there's a nurse that needed<br>a job and i remember standing in a ward<br>with 30 men<br>i'm a psychiatric nurse by trade<br>and i remember standing in the showers<br>and thinking<br>my father won't like this that i'm<br>standing in the showers of 30 naked men<br>in the morning<br>and i'm thinking i better not tell dave<br>my father was really<br>unhappy that i became a nurse he wanted<br>me to do a nice clean job like be a<br>teacher<br>or work in a bank he thought that<br>putting hands on people was below my<br>status<br>i don't know what he thought my status<br>was but certainly he would have been<br>horrified if he'd heard the story about<br>30 naked men when i was<br>as i moved through my career i became<br>really passionate about disparities<br>and every day i saw how badly our<br>families were treated in the hospital<br>i was often called out at night and i<br>was called away from my day job as a<br>nurse<br>because a family somewhere in a hospital<br>needed someone to help them navigate<br>often that means that i had to advocate<br>for things that<br>we shouldn't have to fight for things<br>like<br>i want to stay with my father overnight<br>he's been admitted to hospital<br>why do we have to fight a health system<br>about that who gets to choose how many<br>of us<br>are in a room uh who gets to choose<br>how we die well we do<br>and i learned then that we needed strong<br>voices around us<br>and we needed people who would fear us<br>those battles take a toll they took a<br>personal toll on my life<br>and they took a personal toll on my<br>family<br>but what i learned was we had to fight<br>really hard and<br>i was pleased to have fought that battle<br>and i look now and things have changed<br>somewhat<br>only last week i was in auckland<br>hospital with my 89 year old mother<br>and as i walked into the room in the<br>emergency department<br>there was a lovely young new<br>zealand-born indian physician<br>love the young woman and she was sitting<br>relaxed on the bed<br>and she was chatting to mum and when i<br>walked in she introduced herself<br>to me both by name and by position not<br>i'm one of the doctors<br>or totally ignoring me which had been<br>common practice for many years<br>and she talked to my mother like she was<br>a person like she cared about her<br>like she understood that my mother lives<br>in a bubble with 11 of us<br>with an additional four dogs and death<br>row daisy the cat that refuses to die<br>bit like mum<br>and she understood that we were a<br>collective that it wasn't<br>a conversation just with my mother about<br>her care but it was a conversation with<br>all of us<br>and so that's how health has changed but<br>in order for that to change we need to<br>have people in our workforce<br>who are able to articulate the context<br>in which we live<br>you know who are able to talk about how<br>things need to change<br>and to interpret their context even<br>better we need our own people in the<br>workforce and i have to say over 40<br>years not much has changed<br>if you look across the health sector we<br>have one<br>pacific ceo we have one pacific chair of<br>a board<br>we have one tier two health sector<br>manager<br>and that's about it that is shameful<br>absolutely shameful<br>and so what i would say to the health<br>sector is<br>you've had your chance it's now our<br>chance<br>we should be determining our own<br>solution we can craft our solutions<br>we can grow our workforce and we surely<br>couldn't do a worse job than has been<br>done for us for the last 40 years<br>so it's now our time if it's going to be<br>our time then we need to step<br>up we need to be really clear about the<br>inequities<br>pacific women are paid 26 less than men<br>in my role i have often been the only<br>woman i have worked alongside men<br>and spent quite a lot of my time making<br>them look good<br>and unpaid 26 and in fact substantially<br>more than that less than most men in a<br>similar role<br>pacific women in new zealand's public<br>service<br>are the lowest paid workers why is that<br>okay<br>and why is it okay that people think<br>that publishing those results<br>actually fixes something when there's no<br>action after that<br>as pacific women we live six<br>years less than non-pacific women<br>50 of our young women who are pregnant<br>are not enrolled with a midwife<br>and they turn up late we're more likely<br>to suffer from postnatal depression<br>and we're most likely to die from cancer<br>we're more likely to die from stroke and<br>chronic lung disease<br>and we eat less fruit and vegetables and<br>exercise less and i've got to say we<br>drink more and smoke more<br>this isn't just a list of statistics<br>this is real for me<br>my mother is 90. i will not live as long<br>as her because i'm a pacific woman<br>i will not live to see my<br>great-grandchildren grow up and get<br>married<br>like my mother is i will not see that<br>just because i'm a pacific woman<br>that's really really disturbing to me<br>and as i have four generations who live<br>in my household with me<br>i desperately want my daughters my<br>daughter-in-law's<br>and my granddaughters to actually live a<br>longer and better life<br>when i think about what we need to do<br>about that we need to be fearless<br>we need to lead by example and we need<br>to take every opportunity<br>to work alongside other pacific women<br>and rise them up it's not about what we<br>do for us<br>it's what we can do for our sisters and<br>in<br>everywhere i look there's always an<br>opportunity<br>in my own organisation in the last 12<br>months we've<br>increased our pacific women<br>board members and we have 22 governors<br>across all our companies<br>from 14 of our board members to 66<br>it's intentional we intend to have more<br>women running our organization<br>and we intend to support them into<br>leadership roles<br>you know with due respect to the<br>incredible men that i work alongside<br>it's our time to and we need to be<br>active in making that happen it won't<br>happen by chance<br>i've been very pleased in the<br>organisation to make changes<br>so that families come through and that<br>our young women who have young children<br>no longer feel guilty<br>about needing to come in late after they<br>drop their kids off<br>go home early and pick them up from<br>preschool and take their parents and<br>their sisters to medical appointments<br>this is our life we can work and have a<br>life as well<br>and we need to be consistent with our<br>values and with the way that we operate<br>i can do that because i'm the ceo and i<br>have very little patience for people who<br>talk about all the things that are wrong<br>when in their fear of employment<br>in their um ability to impact you can<br>make lots of changes<br>you don't need someone's permission to<br>do that and as we step up and into<br>leadership roles we should be able to do<br>all of that<br>we need to shine a light on our young<br>talent<br>and i particularly recognize a sinner<br>who is on this conference pool today and<br>as she starts her career with foreign<br>affairs<br>i look forward to watching her bright<br>star shine<br>but we need to shine a light on our<br>young talents on our young women<br>at every opportunity we need to give<br>them a hand up<br>we need to work alongside them<br>we need to provide opportunities and be<br>absolutely aggressive about that<br>we recognized about 10 years ago in our<br>organization that the young men were<br>actually getting paid more<br>we knew that because we actually looked<br>at us and now every year<br>we review all our salaries and we check<br>that we are paying our women the same<br>as our men it's really important that we<br>actually check ourselves<br>i thought we were pretty slick but it's<br>not true young pacific men are much more<br>aggressive<br>at negotiating their salary and that<br>getting a better deal than women are<br>and so we need to actively um intervene<br>to make that happen<br>a couple of years ago we started sending<br>our women to<br>harvard previously only men got to go to<br>harvard<br>and it was a real pleasure for us to be<br>in the presence of professor amy tuddy<br>at harvard and as i reflected on that<br>photo this week<br>three pacific women plus myself<br>standing alongside amikadi in harvard<br>was kind of breathtaking really we all<br>have an opportunity to do better we all<br>have an opportunity to step forward<br>we can't um continue to make the excuse<br>that our culture is respectful<br>and so we shouldn't say anything we<br>shouldn't stand up we shouldn't be<br>countered<br>our culture is proud we are warriors we<br>are navigators<br>we survive and we're fantastic and we<br>need to step forward at every<br>opportunity and we shouldn't be shy<br>about that<br>we need to teach our young women that<br>not only can they be excellent with<br>anything they want to be<br>but their superpower is their<br>pacificness<br>their language their culture their<br>values and their family<br>when i think about uh the challenges you<br>know the challenges of racism would have<br>been talked about here but also cost to<br>families and costs to sell<br>in the course of my career i've lost a<br>son through drink driving<br>i got up and two weeks later came back<br>to work<br>i've had a number of health challenges<br>and never paid much attention to them<br>just being very grateful that the next<br>day i was alive<br>and less than 12 months ago i actually<br>died but here we are<br>god sent me back obviously not good<br>enough and was rejected for another go<br>round<br>my final advice to young women is this<br>i'm a really great<br>reader like many of you and i really<br>love<br>brene brown i love her courage<br>and this is from something that brene<br>brown wrote<br>there is no greater threat to the<br>critics and cynics and fear mongers than<br>those of us who are willing to fall<br>because we have learned how to rise with<br>skinned knees and bruised hearts we<br>choose<br>owning our stories of struggle over<br>hiding<br>over hustling over pretending<br>when we deny our stories they define us<br>when we run from struggle we are never<br>free<br>so we turn toward truth and we look it<br>in the eye<br>we indeed look it in the eye we will not<br>be characters in our stories not<br>villains not victims not even heroes<br>we are the authors of our lives we write<br>our own<br>daring endings we craft love from<br>heartbreak<br>compassion from shame grace from<br>disappointment and courage from failure<br>showing up is our superpower story is<br>our way home<br>truth is our song we are the brave and<br>brokenhearted<br>we are rising strong this to me really<br>resonates<br>as a pacific woman and i thank you so<br>much for the opportunity to speak with<br>you today my lord peter<br>hello peter um debbie thank you so much<br>for sharing your experiences<br>and also some of the examples of how<br>you've affected<br>affected change that's debbie was the<br>the last speaker we do have<br>some time to take some questions<br>to start off i do have a question for<br>the three of you<br>um the question i have got is um<br>from your from your each of your<br>respective<br>perspectives um how have you been able<br>to affect change in your roles<br>geradine shall i ask you to go first<br>sure sure thanks um i'll try and be<br>quick to give the others an opportunity<br>um i think uh it's recognizing that you<br>don't hold<br>all the expertise uh it's very specific<br>um and very woman uh to be collective in<br>your nature and your thinking<br>and so for me it is about<br>making sure that i call on my broader<br>networks<br>and and access the skills and experience<br>that sit in the wider collective of<br>pacific women and pacific health<br>i agree i think it's um you know<br>networking and getting all your networks<br>um to help you work with the<br>you know workforce development for us so<br>partnering with<br>uh the tertiary education<br>has been quite significant for us in<br>developing uh the maori and pacific<br>nurses coming in<br>um you know into the workforce it's been<br>important<br>i think it's being at the table i think<br>it's all of that our collectiveness is a<br>real strength for us but we need to be<br>at the table<br>we need to be where decisions are made<br>and we need to follow the money<br>at the end of the day a question for<br>three of you again at the end of the end<br>of the day<br>and listen changing environment and<br>health and education and all the reforms<br>going on<br>how important is it that women who are<br>pacific or pacific women<br>are at the forefront of um<br>of decision making and being at the<br>table<br>okay um very important you have to be<br>part of<br>of the sorry can you hear me<br>um to to be part of um the decision<br>making to<br>to influence the change um that's really<br>important<br>but also it's about our ability to<br>articulate the strengths that we bring<br>um that's that's really important um i<br>think as well<br>maybe you've got a lot of experience um<br>in this area<br>did you want to go next um thanks jordan<br>i think the first thing is that we need<br>to use our collectiveness<br>and we need to exercise our voice and<br>the health reforms regardless of all the<br>stats everyone knows them like there's<br>nothing new about this<br>uh but we have been overlooked we're<br>often tacked on to the end of the<br>sentence<br>we collectively need to come together as<br>a health sector we need to stand up and<br>we need to put pressure on<br>unless i'm mistaken we all pay our taxes<br>so we have the right to have a say in<br>the health system<br>and it's for us to design what those<br>solutions are<br>it's not for other people anymore to be<br>telling us how to look after our people<br>um yes i agree and i just to add to that<br>um we definitely need woman around that<br>table but it can't be your only strategy<br>if that's your only strategy because at<br>the end of the day and i can see that<br>um millie winks on um line i'm hoping<br>that she will agree with me here<br>is that you're one voice and quite often<br>that voice can be voted down by the<br>majority<br>so if that's your only strategy then you<br>need to really think hard about how else<br>you<br>as as the collective term of pacific is<br>unique to aotearoa<br>what's um for those who may not be um<br>so familiar was it<br>what's our point of difference in<br>specific wahine toa in aotearoa what<br>what does that mean and what does it<br>it's funny how um we've got this whole<br>group but i'm looking at you be like you<br>go<br>um i'm going to defer to um<br>you're making me feel really old um you<br>know pacific has been a convenient<br>kind of collection we need to make it<br>clear to people that it's<br>an artificial kind of thing you know<br>there is no pacific there's no country<br>called pacific we're not pacific<br>you know i'm a tongan woman actually i<br>use pacific as part of a collective<br>approach so that we can come together<br>and get numbers really to make an<br>impact and make a difference but at the<br>end of the day we need to<br>encourage i think particularly our young<br>women<br>to be really comfortable in who they are<br>and whatever paths they bring to that i<br>think there's been you know considerable<br>bias inside the community around whether<br>you're a real pacific person<br>or you're not whether you really speak a<br>language or you're not<br>and i think that does a disservice to<br>our collective group<br>we all bring our unique superpower and<br>so<br>um i think pacific is used for me from<br>my perspective<br>outside um of my community of my family<br>you know my island and my village and<br>i agree with db and<br>you know sometimes from a data<br>perspective as well when you look at the<br>group collectively you don't<br>actually understand what the underlying<br>insights might be<br>and so to respond<br>may mean that you deliver things that<br>aren't<br>entirely appropriate because tommen's do<br>behave differently from samoans<br>and cook islanders and so um<br>you know taking ethnic specific<br>approaches<br>is often what is needed to be more<br>effective<br>for those who are listening you're<br>welcome to<br>add some questions in the chat um while<br>we're waiting for some questions<br>um i i've got one last question if you<br>could um<br>sit sit with the uh the main<br>decision makers from each of you what<br>are what are some<br>key things that you advice you would<br>give that we could<br>then uh see that could positively<br>contribute to<br>our pacific well-being increase<br>in outcomes you know in all areas what's<br>the advice you'd give to those people<br>who<br>had the decision making or held the<br>and i i and i'm in a position<br>which is very privileged where i<br>actually do provide this advice<br>uh whether they want it or not um and my<br>advice is that<br>this is our time this is our season uh<br>we<br>are now in a position as a community to<br>make decisions and to<br>navigate our own pathway and we need to<br>be<br>provided the opportunity to do that what<br>that requires is a giving up of power<br>a sharing of power and a sharing of<br>resources<br>and we will continue to make noise until<br>i agree with debbie once again<br>i think where we've been most effective<br>and what we need to do is we need to<br>collect some of the traditional<br>boundaries that um prevent us from<br>working<br>in uh specific models of care um<br>and debbie covered some of this in her<br>talk and i covered a little bit of it<br>in mine where um<br>the expertise doesn't have to sit with<br>the government agency<br>and you have to give up some of the<br>power<br>we have to come up with our own<br>solutions you know we do know what the<br>disparities are and we've talked about<br>it um for so long but we are the<br>solution as well<br>we have to come up with the solution um<br>because otherwise<br>the solutions that have come up<br>previously aren't working for us<br>so it is our opportunity to to raise up<br>and say these are the things that are<br>not working because that's important but<br>the solutions to that are<br>comes to the end of our um our presenter<br>session<br>and question and answers um loretta i'll<br>hand back to you<br>uh once again thank you for the<br>opportunity to be part of this<br>um but also be able to<br>host a fantastic lineup of speakers<br>and our wonderful esteemed panelist i do<br>have one question panelist that has come<br>through from<br>long standing awesome woman supporter<br>mali went<br>and she has asked can the everyday<br>person and society do<br>things two things to help improve<br>increase gender equity and health what<br>are those things<br>can i start with uh jared dean i know<br>jenny thinks it's because of your age<br>but it's not it's because of your wealth<br>of experience<br>she definitely doesn't look um aged in<br>any way<br>um yeah so i think<br>um you know i hear this week in<br>particular the term wokeism being thrown<br>around like it's a negative thing<br>but i think in the first instance<br>the everyday person can read up on what<br>the issues are<br>next week there is a document being<br>released from the health quality safety<br>commission<br>called bulla soltu in that is a terrible<br>account<br>of the health status of pacific peoples<br>um in new zealand it's nothing that we<br>don't already know<br>but i would encourage you to have a read<br>of this document<br>if you're just um if you're an everyday<br>person that doesn't really feel<br>confident that you've got a handle on<br>what some of the pacific health issues<br>are<br>this document will give you a really<br>any more pearls of wisdoms to come um<br>for the everyday person<br>i i think there are two things that are<br>really important<br>encourage young women and support young<br>women to do science at school<br>that's really important for the health<br>sector<br>and the second thing is give people jobs<br>jobs are the single way that we can<br>improve health outcomes by improving you<br>know prosperity and family<br>and so if the everyday person had an<br>opportunity to do that<br>in whatever form whether that's sitting<br>beside a woman and helping her do her cv<br>whether it's talking to a young woman<br>and encouraging her to do<br>science or talking to our babies at<br>preschool<br>and getting them to count and right all<br>those things make a difference<br>wonderful thank you very much debbie i<br>know we are way over time my<br>my colleagues are telling me to hurry<br>along because there is an interactive<br>session that is coming after this before<br>i wrap up<br>but there is one question that i think<br>would be worth the panelists<br>um giving their brief responses to and<br>just to let our audiences know if there<br>are still questions coming through we<br>will collect them and provide some<br>answers and circulate them out<br>the question is with the investment in<br>health research and development i.e the<br>health research council<br>focused on improving outcomes for<br>pacific peoples<br>how can these studies be better utilized<br>yes i'm not sure what mainstreaming<br>means uh<br>because i don't feel like i'm in the<br>mainstream uh my experience of<br>uh watching the health research council<br>function is that it kind of comes a bit<br>in ways<br>but what i would say is that they seldom<br>use their whole allocation for pacific<br>uh research first point uh second point<br>a lot of specific research that is done<br>uh is not focused on the issues that<br>need to be addressed which<br>allows us a better understanding of what<br>interventions work<br>and so i think focusing on impact how<br>can we measure impact and what makes a<br>difference<br>i think would be a really good<br>investment for the future<br>my loyalty geradine<br>um i'm just kind of pulling together a<br>number of the responses so apologies if<br>this comes across<br>a little bit muddled i know that the<br>specific question is about health<br>research but<br>um often we just look at one aspect<br>and ask how is this going to solve<br>health but actually we need to look<br>at the system in its entirety<br>and how they all the elements come<br>together<br>to solve the issue of pacific health of<br>which<br>research is one very very important part<br>so i just wanted to make that<br>i guess using it and listening to it is<br>really important is probably the most<br>important because often<br>when i've seen research done on pacific<br>people<br>and it goes to a mainstream agency<br>and i think particularly of one that i<br>saw when i had experience with the<br>health promotion agency when<br>information from the community was given<br>to them in the way of<br>uh research they said oh we can't do<br>that that's terrible<br>there's absolutely no way that we can do<br>that<br>and yeah so needs to be heard<br>thank you jaradine and jama<br>i agree with both of those we look at<br>the the research and then we try<br>to fit it into the system uh and not<br>making changes<br>that is recommended from that research<br>because it doesn't fit the mainstream<br>therefore<br>we cannot do so we'll park it because it<br>it's not applicable<br>now whereas what probably the<br>recommendations are saying is that<br>the system is not um meeting the needs<br>but we we're not<br>changing the system to do that<br>and tanya i know you've been moderating<br>but i'm going to take over the<br>moderation for you for you so you can<br>provide a response<br>hi well workforce development is<br>something i'm really passionate about<br>and i think that's a a huge opportunity<br>to to transform and to build that<br>cultural capital and cultural confidence<br>especially in our non-pacific colleagues<br>and peers<br>so if the research is related to that<br>how can we bridge over to a non-pacific<br>i i get a strong sense a lot of our<br>non-pacific want to do something<br>um and they want to they want to support<br>um our kaupapa<br>a lot of the time they don't know what<br>to do so they do nothing<br>so if we can somehow infiltrate the<br>workforce development<br>um give it to them in a um<br>in a in a way that that is understood<br>so they're able to apply it um and<br>that would be able to we need all the<br>help we can um as pacific<br>to um to support um better outcomes we<br>can't do it by ourself<br>so the more champions we have along<br>beside us and behind us<br>um we you know that will certainly um um<br>support the cause<br>um kia ora kia ora thank you tanya<br>i've got two more questions i will wrap<br>them into one<br>um because they're interrelated what are<br>the strategies that can be used to<br>influence<br>more pacifica youths and to be involved<br>in the health sector<br>and what is one quality you look for in<br>pacific women leaders that you would<br>um i'll i'll start i uh i'll start with<br>the<br>what's the quality the quality for me is<br>courage<br>um you know i think you need to have<br>courage<br>and kindness um those two things i think<br>go a long way in a leadership journey<br>and enables you to step<br>up in terms of young people um i think<br>we need to<br>provide young people with the confidence<br>that they bring value<br>they don't have to have all the all the<br>skills they don't have to have all of<br>the papers and the leases behind their<br>name but anything is possible<br>uh i'm a living example of that i left<br>school at 15<br>and i run a 53 million dollar final or a<br>commissioning<br>organization anything is possible um<br>and i think we need to give our young<br>people the opportunity<br>and the confidence that they can be<br>anything they want to be there's a job<br>for everyone in the health sector<br>hello beethoven<br>uh yeah um so there are wonderful<br>examples um<br>out in the sector where youth have been<br>engaged and<br>i'm thinking of youthquake at capital<br>coast where<br>um you know for a lot of our pacific<br>young people we are smart and we are<br>clever but we<br>fail in the system and i just you know<br>was really on that fine line i was<br>really lucky and by the sounds of things<br>debbie too was<br>lucky engaging them in co-design<br>processes<br>if they haven't come through a<br>traditional academic<br>pathway is a really good way of<br>encouraging young people<br>to harness their natural talent<br>and for that talent to be recognized so<br>in terms of the<br>quality i don't think the quality of our<br>young people is<br>phenomenal it's just that it's not seen<br>they're invisible um and so on that note<br>i just wanted to<br>challenge um tanya and you know for for<br>non-pacific people that want to do<br>something and don't know what to do and<br>so therefore do nothing that's totally<br>inappropriate<br>um you should not do nothing we don't<br>have the luxury<br>of doing nothing so politely i'd like to<br>challenge that if you're<br>non-pacific and you don't know what to<br>wonderful i'm juradine tanya oh kia ora<br>geradine i<br>i agree and that's where i think<br>workforce development um<br>can play a big part um to support um or<br>to challenge that doing nothing<br>because it certainly isn't acceptable um<br>i think that the qualities<br>um that we're looking for is<br>a high high resilience high adaptability<br>and a strong sense of self-identity um<br>or the willingness to continue that<br>journey of self-identity<br>so certainly as a pacific and aotearoa<br>you do need to be resilient and<br>adaptable<br>as we know you can see by the the<br>environment<br>times are changing um and you need to be<br>able to seek where those opportunities<br>are<br>and um and and make the best of them um<br>but also<br>not only um of course for yourself but<br>looking for<br>for those who stand uh behind you that<br>have supported you your community and<br>your whanau<br>sorry agree with all of those as well um<br>exposure uh<br>into the into what health offers um<br>is really good and some initiatives that<br>are already being done by the dhbs<br>around is exposing them much earlier so<br>that they are choosing the right<br>subjects at school so much earlier in<br>the piece would<br>you know entice them to say okay this is<br>what i can offer as well<br>you know i do agree knowing yourself as<br>a quality<br>is part of that because that is what you<br>bring to wherever you're going to work<br>venaka anjana thank you all very much<br>again our wonderful esteemed<br>knowledgeable<br>panel you have inspired me you have<br>given me more fire in my belly<br>um we have one more interactive session<br>please don't go
