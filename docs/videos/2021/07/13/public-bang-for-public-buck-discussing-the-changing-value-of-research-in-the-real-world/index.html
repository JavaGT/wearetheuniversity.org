The panel will talk about the commercial, social, environmental and policy impacts of publicly funded research, and answer your questions.<br>Panellists:<br><br>Dr Carrie Barber:<br><br>Dr Barber has recently featured in news media with her Positively Pregnant app, a free tool to support families through pregnancy. As a clinical psychologist, development of the app stemmed from her current research focus on perinatal mental health.<br><br>Associate Professor Adam Hartland:<br><br>Dr Hartland is a Kudos Award-winning environmental geochemist who has taken an interdisciplinary approach to environmental sampling. His research has resulted in the development of an automated water sampler for cave environments, a tool gaining attention for its commercial, and research, applications.<br><br>Associate Professor Kura Paul-Burke:<br><br>Dr Paul-Burke (Ngāti Awa, Ngāti Whakahemo) has applied mātauranga Māori principles to her mātai moana - marine research, mapping generations of knowledge passed down via local kaumātua to the restoration, management and development of shellfish beds in the Eastern Bay of Plenty.<br><br>This Kaupapa Kōrero "little talks, big topics" was held at the Gallagher Academy of

accurate.</p><p>thank you<br>for issuing forth this freezing weather<br>it's clearly kept several people at home<br>uh but that's okay because we're gonna<br>have a small and into much chat<br>instead my name is bryony james i'm the<br>deputy vice chancellor research at<br>tethering<br>the purpose of this intermittent series<br>of public lectures<br>is to talk about topics of<br>interest to our community in the<br>broadest sense that are informed<br>by our own research the original<br>intention<br>for tonight's talk was to have<br>a reflection on the government's budget<br>and looking at how<br>that budget had reflected the<br>recent and very public value that the<br>aotearoa research community has<br>contributed<br>in keeping the public safe in recent<br>months and the last year<br>now of course as it turned out budget<br>didn't really reflect that at all<br>so that got me thinking i thought if i<br>traveled around<br>and asked people up and down the country<br>what<br>value does university research offer<br>i would get as many answers as the<br>number of people that i asked<br>and part of the reason for that i think<br>might be that sometimes we forget<br>as university academics to pause and<br>actually<br>tell the world about the amazing stuff<br>we're doing<br>so a little bit of that is what we're<br>going to do tonight<br>also what we're going to do tonight<br>we're going to consider the idea of<br>research<br>impact now the impact of research is<br>something you hear about a lot at the<br>moment as university<br>academics we hear about it a lot from<br>our funders they want to see what impact<br>will our research make in the world but<br>crucially our community<br>also asks us the same question what<br>impact on me<br>will your research have and i think<br>so tonight we are very fortunate to have<br>three researchers<br>who will talk to us about their impact<br>and i'm talking about impact in the<br>broadest possible sense not just<br>economic impact but impact across<br>human social and natural capitals<br>now my personal definition always sits<br>at the back of my mind when i talk about<br>research impact<br>is the change we want to make in the<br>world<br>and we have three wonderful change<br>makers here without<br>us tonight sadly uh ian white is unable<br>to join us<br>so we are depleted but not bereft<br>and and carrie adam and kura<br>are going to share some of their<br>research stories with us and talk about<br>the change<br>that they're making in the world with a<br>nice<br>small audience like this hopefully we'll<br>leave plenty of time at the end<br>for questions and on that note the<br>structure of this talk<br>is so that we'll have around 10 12<br>minutes each from each of our wonderful<br>panelists<br>and plenty of time at the end of people<br>to ask questions<br>and the easiest way these days for<br>people to ask questions is via<br>technology<br>is amanda with the app ended up here<br>so if we there we are if you if you do<br>your smartphone thingy with the qr code<br>up there<br>that'll send you to an app called slido<br>and slido will enable you to ask you<br>questions<br>throughout the talk or at the end and at<br>the end they will get beamed to my<br>ipad here hopefully and we'll pass them<br>on to our panelists<br>so that's the format for tonight what<br>i'll do is introduce each of our<br>speakers<br>internals as it's their turn to talk and<br>at the first speaker tonight is dr kerry<br>barber<br>now kerry might look familiar to you<br>because she's spent a lot of time on the<br>news recently<br>talking about the app she developed<br>called positively pregnant<br>now positively pregnant is designed to<br>support<br>families through pregnancy reducing the<br>anxiety of that time and helping people<br>transition<br>into parenthood carey is a clinical<br>psychologist so development of that app<br>stemmed from her research<br>looking at perinatal mental health<br>bubba<br>thank you is this yes it sounds like<br>it's working<br>um yes as brian he said i'm a clinical<br>psychologist and originally<br>um was most interest working with<br>children and adolescents um<br>and over but over the last 15 years or<br>more oh it's going on by itself<br>oh we're going back that's all right i<br>have a power<br>um the last 15 years or so<br>i've gotten interested in sort of moving<br>back before the beginning and trying to<br>get families off to a good start<br>and recognizing how important in<br>particular<br>perinatal mental health as a general<br>field sort of evolved<br>going back um largely out of the<br>um an interest in postnatal depression<br>which you may have heard about<br>but in the last decade or so we've<br>recognized<br>more and more the importance of<br>pregnancy as well<br>and the kinds of challenges that<br>families cope with during pregnancy so<br>that's why<br>that's what we decided to focus this app<br>on so why pregnancy so we're developing<br>an<br>app to help families as they um as they<br>transition to parenthood um pregnancy is<br>a time of enormous change<br>both physically we hear all about that<br>but also<br>um psychologically stress is sort of is<br>often defined as sort of the disruption<br>of homeostasis and things<br>that are changing and pregnancy is all<br>sorts of things changing<br>um so that's so that can be a stress but<br>it also is a time of enormous<br>opportunity it's a time when people<br>think about their lives<br>and think about what's important and<br>make plans for how they want their<br>family to develop<br>and so and it's a time when they have<br>extra incentive<br>to change some of their health habits or<br>what lifestyle plans<br>um so it's a time that we want to take<br>advantage of<br>that capacity for reflection and making<br>change<br>to work not only to help those who are<br>struggling but also to help those who<br>are doing okay<br>to move in a positive direction okay for<br>so it's a time of change and that stress<br>um can be difficult um most people<br>though manage it well<br>but for a smaller proportion 20 to 30<br>percent or so<br>it that stress gets converted to<br>distress they've got that anxiety that<br>might take the form of<br>anxiety depression doubt in themselves<br>as they're becoming parents worrying<br>now some degree of that is normal um<br>probably almost everybody feels but when<br>it becomes<br>so when it starts to sort of take over<br>um a person's world view that's when we<br>start to worry about it so the app<br>and that matters i suppose what we've<br>learned over the last<br>15 or 20 years is that that anxiety and<br>depression has an impact<br>not only on the psychological<br>development of the parents<br>but also on the physiological<br>development of the child and children<br>who are born to parents mothers who are<br>struggling with that<br>are more likely to struggle with a<br>number of other things so that's the<br>motivation beside<br>behind why we want to develop tools that<br>can help<br>families during pregnancy to cope better<br>with all the kinds of changes that are<br>going on<br>now they we we could say okay well they<br>should go see a psychologist like me<br>paranatal mental health<br>um but what we know from from a lot of<br>what you've heard in the news in the<br>last six months especially i think that<br>that our mental health care system<br>is very much overstretched and they<br>can't all access a psychologist nor<br>would they necessarily want to<br>but there's a lot in psychology that<br>they can access and that's what we've<br>tried to put<br>into this app positively pregnant um now<br>why an app then when<br>you know when i first started this i<br>barely knew what an app was<br>it was actually some of my students who<br>said i was saying well we want something<br>that people can have<br>with them and that can't be stolen we<br>were talking about some other<br>computerized programs and things like<br>that and they said what about an app<br>i said an app and then we so gradually<br>over the last<br>six or seven years i've learned on some<br>of the advantages<br>of an app for this sort of task um<br>in when we we first started working on<br>this in 2015<br>2016 or so i was looking back at the<br>data<br>that we had then about how many people<br>had a smartphone this is of young adults<br>um at that point in 2014 82<br>of young adults had a smartphone so even<br>then this was a pervasive tool<br>i looked at this again last week to find<br>out<br>you know i wonder what percentage of the<br>population has a smartphone now and it<br>said 142<br>of the population has a smartphone<br>i think they must be calculating the<br>number<br>of smartphones to people so some people<br>have more than one clearly but very so<br>virtually everybody<br>um and certainly virtually all pregnant<br>women<br>have and use um smartphones so it's it's<br>it's it's accessible to most people and<br>there are low cost there are high cost<br>expensive ones there are also some<br>that are low-cost and we've designed the<br>app to work on the most basic models of<br>cell phones<br>that not only are they accessible to<br>lots of people they're also available<br>you have it in your pocket<br>so it's something you can access on a<br>moment-to-moment basis if you want<br>unfortunately<br>for some people if you want to apps are<br>also<br>adaptable you can tailor the content to<br>information that the person puts in so<br>that they can get<br>personalized information back and that's<br>really helpful for the kind of<br>information that we were talking about<br>and it's not they're interactive it's<br>not just like reading a book<br>it's actually reading information that<br>is tailored to<br>the question the way that you've<br>answered questions into what you<br>are coping with at that time and so that<br>what the<br>app can link to information both local<br>information<br>um about new zealand resources and<br>situations<br>um and also information that's on there<br>on online because there's a whole lot<br>out there in the world<br>for people when they're<br>in that process of becoming a parent<br>so we decided to develop an app we call<br>it positively pregnant<br>um that comes both out of um the idea<br>that uh<br>that this a lot of posit what's called<br>positive psychology is a sort of domain<br>within psychology that<br>that's also developed over the last 20<br>years or so about trying to help people<br>to facilitate sort of well-being as<br>opposed to just<br>solving problems to actually make what's<br>okay better<br>and we're using a lot of the tools from<br>positive psychology in this<br>app we also did a little did a survey at<br>the<br>part of the beginning and development of<br>the app and this was the most popular<br>name<br>and it's it's a bit of a catchy title so<br>we decided to develop this app<br>it's focusing on the social and<br>emotional side of becoming a parent<br>there are plenty of apps out there to<br>tell you about how big the baby is or<br>count your contractions or lots of other<br>things<br>but there was very little out there<br>about what it means<br>emotionally to become a mother what it<br>means<br>socially in terms of your relationships<br>so that's what we were aiming at<br>and the app has four different sets of<br>components<br>um that are interactive in different<br>ways there's a set of<br>things of things called know yourself<br>which are like<br>quizzes essentially you answer questions<br>about your strengths and values and<br>resources<br>your stressors what's going on for you<br>right now<br>what kinds of strategies you've used or<br>would be interested in trying<br>to kind of cope when you're stressed out<br>who are the people around you for social<br>support<br>and how you think about the world and<br>and think about the choices that you're<br>making because pregnancy is a time when<br>there are an awful lot of choices to be<br>made<br>and often made in in<br>collaboration hopefully with another<br>person the partner or support person<br>and so some of those tools ask those<br>questions and then give you feedback<br>about how you might make those choices<br>and how much<br>the two of the couple make those choices<br>together how their thinking styles work<br>together<br>so those are the interactive those are<br>the know yourself taking<br>advantage of the time for reflection um<br>then there are also a series of<br>of prompts for conversations really sort<br>of a structure for<br>uh having either the person and their<br>partner<br>or a support person um or they can be<br>used as prompts for individual<br>reflection but thinking about<br>ranging from things that are most basic<br>like who does what like chores which is<br>a popular topic or a<br>controversial topic in a lot of um in a<br>lot of these situations what who is<br>doing what now who's going to do what<br>after the baby comes<br>and then they the couple can compare<br>their answers to those questions<br>the others are more things like we like<br>traditions what kinds of traditions do<br>you want to have for your child and<br>family<br>talking about things like the birth who<br>do you want to be there how do you want<br>to handle different things<br>parenting choices and styles and those<br>sorts so<br>facilitating interaction and<br>conversation and thinking about those<br>things<br>then there are um activities within the<br>app which we call do something there are<br>six<br>audio recorded kind of relaxation<br>meditation<br>things as well as some more journaling<br>oriented a gratitude journal<br>a journal you can take pictures and<br>write notes to the baby<br>those sorts of things and<br>and then some things like just have<br>watching funny videos just how to relax<br>on those sorts of things and finally<br>there's find out which are<br>are just bite-sized pieces of<br>information about again that<br>social interpersonal um and emotional<br>side of becoming a parent and<br>how can you man and managing things like<br>managing worry managing mood<br>what to do if actually you find that you<br>need more help and how you might seek<br>that out<br>go now and go and i wanted to go so how<br>might this help<br>what we're trying to do with it is both<br>um<br>help the people this the app is designed<br>hopefully to be useful to the range of<br>people<br>um people who are doing pretty well and<br>just want to make sure they stay that<br>way<br>and take this chance to look and think<br>about things to improve their well-being<br>and resilience<br>to enhance to give them different<br>options for coping and more flexible<br>things that they can do<br>and also for those who are struggling to<br>prevent that<br>distress becoming worse to give them<br>some ideas for how to reach out for<br>support and how to figure out what works<br>for them<br>um so that they don't become more<br>distressed and and<br>more and have a bigger effect on the<br>child and the broader family<br>and to provide information and support<br>for those who do<br>need more formal mental health services<br>or what are the options out there for<br>support<br>for those people so it's aimed at a<br>range of different<br>situations um and so then moving on to<br>what we want to<br>do in the future right now so what we've<br>been the reason we've gotten some<br>great press with the help of our of our<br>communications department<br>recently is because we've just launched<br>a new a revised version of the app<br>positive pregnant was originally<br>launched in<br>late 2018 um but we have we<br>have gotten some funding to reprogram<br>and design it<br>and it's been launched in the newer<br>version recently so we're trying to get<br>that word out<br>to midwives and health professionals and<br>parents and people<br>um just to give it a try and and<br>see if it's useful so that's one of the<br>big focuses now i'm talking to groups of<br>gps and midwives and those sorts of<br>people<br>um then we also one of the things i<br>discovered in developing this app is<br>that it's<br>it's never finished it's not like a book<br>that you're published and it's done<br>it's like continuing even if even if the<br>information stays the same which it<br>doesn't<br>the the program the comp the devices<br>change so you have to have continual<br>re fixing um and program and and that<br>provides an opportunity<br>for continuing improvement for taking<br>feedback we have<br>on our webpage people are always welcome<br>to give feedback and ideas<br>and we can incorporate those as we<br>continue to develop it<br>we're hoping in the future to develop a<br>partner version there are some<br>aspects of the current version where the<br>partner is involved and answers<br>questions<br>but we'd like to have a completely<br>stand-alone partner version or linked<br>but an individual partner version that<br>provides some<br>information that's more particular to<br>the situation of those partners<br>and and then although we have focused<br>mainly on prenatal on the pro the<br>experience of pregnancy<br>there's a lot of a lot of the tools and<br>ideas in the app are very<br>uh applicable to the postnatal period to<br>that ongoing parenting<br>experience but we might want to add a<br>postnatal extension to some of the<br>information<br>for that more directly kind of focuses<br>on those times<br>and then the the sort of the ideas and<br>the structure<br>um of the positively pregnant of this<br>particular app<br>also may be applied to other kind of big<br>transitions in people's lives it's about<br>how do we handle and cope with big<br>stress and transition and there are<br>other transitions like from<br>university to work or from work to<br>retirement where the kinds of model that<br>we're talking about here might also be<br>applicable<br>so those are just some future ideas that<br>we've had to think about and<br>we it isn't just me there have been a<br>lot of people who've worked on this<br>project in all sorts of different ways<br>um over the last um six seven whatever<br>number of years<br>um including we did a pilot in 2017 with<br>does this have a pointer thing yes<br>maybe no um with 88 um women who<br>tested out that initial version of the<br>app<br>and now i don't know it has a mind of<br>its own i didn't press it i promise<br>okay we've got automatic transitions<br>turned on for some slides and not others<br>just to<br>just a mess with you just to keep you on<br>your toes thank you karen<br>i i don't think there's some mothers in<br>the audience who should right now log on<br>to slido and come up with some of the<br>suggestions for the partner app<br>because i'm sure you can think of some<br>um our next speaker<br>is is um associate professor adam<br>hartland now adam is an environmental<br>geochemist<br>he's taken an interdisciplinary approach<br>to environmental science<br>which spans the land water continuum<br>now some of these more challenging<br>sampling tasks have been deep<br>underground<br>so this has resulted in him developing a<br>particular piece of kit which is now<br>called sip<br>which is specifically targeted at<br>challenging<br>sampling of water samples in difficult<br>environments<br>so adam's going to talk to us about his<br>research and hopefully his widget<br>hi everyone um thanks for the<br>opportunity to talk to you today about<br>some of the research we're doing on cave<br>systems and we'll get around to talking<br>about<br>the gizmo said um right<br>good so um<br>first a little word about climate um a<br>lot of us<br>probably don't necessarily think about<br>what climate is<br>and from a technical standpoint<br>it's merely the average weather that we<br>experience<br>in any particular location over an<br>extended time period<br>but in the broad sense climate is<br>actually<br>incredibly intricate and complex system<br>of processes that<br>and feedbacks that occur between the<br>atmosphere the oceans<br>and the land and these feedbacks occur<br>on any any number of time scales so from<br>seconds to minutes to millennia and<br>therefore because as humans we've only<br>really been observing climate<br>and climate change for a briefest<br>interval in any meaningful sense<br>we have to really rely and rest our<br>understanding on<br>geological archives the geological<br>record<br>and so that that's things like icicles<br>or marine sediments<br>and by studying these we can understand<br>things like how<br>external processes like changes in<br>earth's orbit with respect to the sun<br>or internal processes like the exchange<br>of carbon dioxide between the oceans and<br>the atmosphere<br>how these impact climate on on a range<br>so within this geological view of<br>climate<br>caves are becoming an increasingly<br>important part<br>we can think of caves and the deposits<br>that form inside<br>them as libraries of climate history<br>but libraries that are written books<br>that are written in foreign language<br>that<br>we don't necessarily understand and it's<br>our job as geoscientists to try and<br>understand those<br>now within my field of cave research<br>it's increasingly recognized that<br>to understand any individual cave system<br>you actually need to spend time<br>in that cave monitoring that cave to<br>understand<br>how it responds to changes in the<br>external environment<br>and with that with that understanding<br>you can then<br>apply that to the deposits that are<br>formed within the cave<br>in order to be able to get a much more<br>precise understanding of how climate has<br>so um yeah so salad mites which are the<br>main<br>type of deposit that formed in that we<br>work with<br>as geoscientists stalagmites form from<br>a single drop of water that forms a film<br>on the palm of the stagmax tip<br>and that film of water provides the<br>material for the growing static knife so<br>ions and molecules are trapped by the<br>cygmate as it grows but then as the next<br>subsequent drop falls<br>that film from which the solubility is<br>growing is reset<br>so we can quickly see that the fluid<br>composition the water<br>composition how it changes over time is<br>really an essential part of the puzzle<br>for understanding the climate records<br>that we are able to get from<br>starting wipes<br>so this is uh an image of the location<br>in waipuna cave in the white hound where<br>we<br>do much of our research we started<br>working here<br>about five years ago um<br>and this was as part of a project called<br>quest and that's a<br>project which we initiated with<br>colleagues in the uk and in europe<br>and the goals of that project were to<br>try and develop new ways of doing this<br>final science<br>to find new and quantitative ways of<br>measuring the past climate using cave<br>deposits<br>secondary the goals of that project were<br>to actually develop records of climate<br>history from new zealand<br>and also other parts of australia<br>austral asia so um<br>parts of the the pacific islands and<br>australia and so<br>to meet that goal we we set about um<br>to monitor wipro in the cave this was<br>our local study site<br>and initially the objective was actually<br>to deploy an auto sampler which had been<br>designed in switzerland<br>for this purpose unfortunately by the<br>time it reached us the auto sampler had<br>sort of succumbed to the attrition of<br>time<br>and corrosion and rodents and all sorts<br>of things<br>and so it was basically unusable<br>so we were left with no other recourse<br>and to start from scratch<br>and actually start a manual monitoring<br>campaign as<br>as is traditionally done and so<br>once a month or so i'll go with my<br>students to wipe in the cave and collect<br>water samples and download loggers and<br>take measurements of the air and so on<br>in order to get this understanding of<br>so just for you just to orient you the<br>uppermost star on the the map is weipona<br>and then the other stars are secondary<br>study sites that we identified where we<br>subject uh having all the preconditions<br>so<br>we carried on three and a half years of<br>work<br>and we published that work last year<br>and this is a monitoring study that<br>supports the subsequent climate<br>histories that we're hoping to produce<br>now it doesn't matter<br>what the plots indicate just just to say<br>that each individual point on those<br>plots<br>represents a water sample someone<br>collected and then analyzed and<br>interpreted<br>so there's a lot of work so if we run<br>the numbers on this<br>we did 36 field trips over the course of<br>that three and a half year period<br>um equating to at least 576 percent<br>hours<br>certainly meant much more than that um<br>we consumed at least 72 pies in the<br>process<br>it's essential caver energy source<br>and we still only achieve monthly<br>resolution data<br>now um caves are very stable<br>environments but even caves and the<br>waters that enter them<br>change on time scales that are more<br>rapid than that<br>so really even in our best case scenario<br>but local<br>easy relatively easy access site we<br>couldn't do much better than<br>so clearly the the goal of trying to<br>develop this time<br>series of water chemistry and water<br>properties<br>from caves that's an insurmountable task<br>in all of the most readily accessed<br>environments so as part of this work we<br>also had<br>the goal of developing a new water<br>sampler to replace the one which<br>died and the goal was to have something<br>that was robust<br>and intuitive that would collect water<br>samples ideally<br>and um and overcome the limitations of<br>previous solutions<br>so that's something that we've been<br>doing as part of this project<br>so initially we funded a masters of<br>engineering projects here at waikato<br>and that project was certainly<br>successful<br>in identifying some solutions to the<br>problem of how you<br>actually build a machine to collect<br>water in a cave<br>but we were left somewhere short of<br>having<br>a functional prototype that we could<br>actually use for our research<br>and as researchers we were just that's<br>all we really want to do<br>is be nerdy and learn about caves you<br>know so<br>kind of left not really having the the<br>solution that we wanted<br>um now the masters project<br>was a success because the research<br>student learned a lot and developed<br>an understanding of their discipline and<br>produce a thesis<br>so the research wasn't a failure by any<br>stretch of the imagination but<br>the applied goal we had was still yet to<br>so unfortunately we were given a contact<br>easter the local<br>firm here in uh kirikou<br>bentek which is in franklin and it's a<br>small company that<br>um they actually run us as a side<br>business alongside the main business so<br>if any of you ever been to led stuff in<br>franklin bought<br>leds and stuff then you'll know it they<br>have this<br>engineering workshop as part of the<br>business and<br>the the business is staffed by former<br>wycatta graduates<br>and also people who are currently<br>studying at waikato so it was really<br>fantastic opportunity to work with<br>people who know the university well and<br>they were able to bring us forward to<br>having something that was a functional<br>prototype that we could begin testing<br>and that was in 2019<br>and so we julie and enthusiastically<br>went caving with that box<br>and there's actually a new way in the<br>south pacific of all places that we<br>went to try and test it and the idea was<br>well this is an extreme environment<br>quite quite an extreme cave environment<br>to test it in and it needs to be we need<br>to be confident that this is going to<br>really work<br>unfortunately we were just met with<br>a series of mishaps problems<br>malfunctions<br>um all sorts of things went wrong you<br>turned the box on the side to try and<br>get it through a constriction and the<br>vials fell out<br>the box was simply just too big as well<br>it couldn't come with us to the places<br>in the case<br>we were able to go so it's you know as<br>um physically we were able to get into<br>places that are surprisingly small<br>and really only limited by the span of<br>our shoulders<br>success we still went didn't have<br>something that really worked and<br>things went on like this for for a while<br>until last year we got to mark three<br>um and now we had something that um as<br>you see before you<br>um it was in two parts so that could be<br>carried<br>um the halves could be carried<br>individually and then assembled<br>mated at the site deployment of the auto<br>sampler<br>um and there are other innovations like<br>screwing files<br>and a wireless interface so we also have<br>it's not quite an app it's it's a it's a<br>website sort of thing<br>the autosampler broadcasts a wi-fi<br>signal that you can then connect with<br>your cell phone and drive the user<br>software and<br>configure it however you want so um<br>after much work and dedication from<br>my student servca who's in the picture<br>here<br>much to his embarrassment probably we<br>were actually it got to the point where<br>we could do some<br>some science with the autosampler and<br>the<br>um we commissioned five units<br>and we um were able to deploy two of the<br>auto samples in<br>south island just in april and may uh<br>this year<br>so this is a picture on the on the left<br>there's a<br>entrance tomorrow on top of a mountain<br>in fiordland<br>near to lake tiana and just to sort of<br>show you you can see a couple of figures<br>there for scale<br>um that these are challenging<br>environments to get to and to do<br>research in<br>so over the course of this period<br>probably about<br>two or three years ago we started<br>working alongside<br>the university's commercialization unit<br>which is called waikato link<br>and they were able to help us<br>work towards having something that was<br>not only suitable for research but also<br>taking it from the province of research<br>into a commercial<br>thing so thanks to them in large part<br>we now have a product that we're<br>actually selling and<br>we've sold i think four not possibly<br>five units<br>um to universities in the usa uk and<br>france<br>and um a website and so you're welcome<br>to go and check it out<br>if you have a spare five minutes<br>and we've started getting the word out<br>so we're using social media to talk to<br>our<br>fellow cave nerds and it's really<br>gratifying to see the<br>interest that's there within our<br>community from people who see the<br>obvious<br>benefits and applications of this for<br>their own research<br>but we're also hopeful that the auto<br>sampler sip<br>after kids have to call it sick now<br>that it has has benefits and utility to<br>other other scientists and people<br>working other kinds of<br>environmental monitoring for whom<br>perhaps<br>the existing tools aren't sufficient to<br>meet their needs<br>as the tagline says more data less work<br>thank you adam as an undergraduate i<br>spent most of<br>my degree skilling lectures under the<br>mended hills but we weren't fueled by<br>pies we were fueled by pasties<br>now our next speaker tonight our last<br>speaker for tonight is associate<br>professor<br>she blends western science with mature<br>and amari<br>to help coastal communities manage their<br>marine tana<br>amongst other things this means mapping<br>generations of knowledge that she<br>acquires by speaking to<br>komatsu and kuya and applying this to<br>the restoration of shellfish beds and<br>the development of the shellfish<br>industry<br>in the eastern bay of plenty so thank<br>you<br>but it's okay because i practiced a<br>we've got it on the screen here but we<br>haven't got it up there<br>it's projecting something it's not<br>yes<br>um let me just explain what<br>my work title is mata mwana and so<br>manpai<br>has a number of meanings matai can mean<br>to investigate or examine something it's<br>also another<br>word for ocean i know you knew that did<br>you know that<br>maokai so when we say my time one is<br>ocean ocean if you really think about it<br>or it's um to investigate the ocean and<br>another word for matai<br>is ecology like ecology<br>biology all the ologies i don't know<br>what other allergies they are so<br>my role here is ap material is<br>but um adam i think you broke it<br>your breakfast well okay i'm just gonna<br>stand in and talk some stuff because i<br>really didn't do<br>that but what i'm going to do tonight<br>what i was hoping to do was share with<br>you some of the work i've been doing in<br>the eastern bay of plenty<br>um around ohio harbour which is<br>we've been working here with um<br>there are four ewe partners and through<br>councils<br>and the half was a really shallow<br>shallow harbour it's exposed 80<br>of us is exposed at low tides that's<br>when you can see all the mudflats<br>and um so i got distracted by the<br>concealed look<br>but um and so what we do because<br>traditionally when we do<br>marine science research we go out we<br>decide i'm going to do this<br>i want to find it out and i get in the<br>water and go find it out<br>but in terms of mata and maori<br>some people can some people describe<br>mata<br>maori as almighty knowledge system<br>we have lots of knowledge systems every<br>culture<br>has their own ways of seeing the world<br>their own ways of celebrating<br>singing dancing eating the foods we eat<br>and even the houses we live in<br>so maori is just a knowledge system<br>passed down through our ancestors<br>because i'm a barbie<br>of course i've got some really cool<br>photos but you'll just have to like ease<br>free them from me<br>um let me see so what we use uh when i<br>do my research i<br>use this approach called a phenomena<br>throat<br>and phenomena just means relationships<br>relationships within yourself within<br>your research team<br>and the people you're researching with<br>and it has<br>four principles if you like<br>and the first principle is so when we go<br>and do our research you know when i<br>first started out<br>research was as i said earlier you just<br>go and do it you don't talk to anyone<br>that's why we do marine<br>because fish don't talk back we don't<br>want to talk to people<br>we want to go out get in the water go<br>for a dive and learn some stuff<br>come back write it up and um and carry<br>humans uh holistic approach to the word<br>is we are a species<br>shakora humans<br>people are humans are species of the<br>world which means we are part<br>of the world we are part of nature<br>so from a mata ranga maori perspective<br>of<br>working within the world means we need<br>to include<br>people in our research and so that's<br>approach alongside marine science and<br>they have a lot of commonalities<br>like marine science and mata ranga maori<br>both seek to better understand the world<br>in which we live<br>which makes sense doesn't it we're all<br>sitting there they're making up theories<br>about<br>why the stars are there why the water<br>does that<br>and so both knowledge systems seek to do<br>the same<br>are we did we give up i'm just like<br>talking<br>i should have done my tap dance um<br>uh let me think what do i have on here<br>oh why don't i just<br>okay um so let me go back to ohio so in<br>ohio<br>back in 2007 we went out with komata or<br>the elders<br>from the two different tribes there are<br>four main<br>around and it's generally known that<br>there are two main kaitiaki<br>or like active guardians in the harbour<br>and so we went out with the with the<br>elders from the ewe and we said to them<br>when you were young<br>uh where did you used to go to get your<br>muscles we were looking at greenlit<br>mussels at that time<br>and the reason we asked him the question<br>about where did you used to go<br>when you were young because it meant<br>that someone from another generation<br>generally took them to go get their<br>muscles or their puppies or whatever<br>so already you have intergenerational<br>knowledge<br>does that make sense cool and so um<br>we went out with our komatsu on the boat<br>and<br>landmarks and intergen all or<br>signs and signals signs of the natural<br>world and they would say<br>muscles start here they end there you'll<br>find scallops here<br>and we went through the whole harvard<br>doing this<br>and that's how we actually interviewed<br>our commander because i've discovered<br>that when we walked into a room to do<br>interviews<br>i have the power which i liked a lot<br>but as a researcher i noticed that<br>our komatsu were looking and nannies<br>that they would look at me as if to say<br>was my answer correct you know how you<br>go someone asks you a question you go<br>it's weird like that and i thought<br>that's not right i'm just<br>a minion i'm i have brown hair there so<br>i'm just a girl but<br>not not so young now and so what i did<br>what we did was decided we needed to get<br>out of the room<br>and get on the water where our<br>participants were our komatsu<br>and which is another word for<br>grandmothers or<br>elderly women where they held the power<br>and they did as soon as we were on the<br>water<br>they just took over because that's their<br>place<br>because it's placed place-based<br>knowledge we then backed<br>we met all the sites where they said um<br>shellfish grew in the harbour and then<br>we went down and dive and it was really<br>really cold but we did it for the team<br>and we went down and we then mapped<br>underwater<br>and those maps um we didn't know that<br>then this was in 2007<br>where people didn't talk about mata rang<br>maori<br>people didn't talk about kaityakitanga<br>which is customary practices and the way<br>we do things<br>culturally you didn't do that with the<br>marine science<br>it just wasn't a thing but we did it<br>because that's what felt right<br>and we met the exact size and shape of<br>the muscle beds in the harbour at that<br>time<br>underwater and we discovered that one<br>bed<br>that was approximately two k's in length<br>had around about 112 million muscles<br>in it and then but two years later we<br>were back<br>and i think it was uh around 80 percent<br>oh 69 to 60 percent of the bed had<br>disappeared<br>and the reason for that was sea stars<br>had come<br>the 11am sea star which is native to<br>aotearoa<br>had decimated 60 of the bed<br>so if this was the bed here behind me<br>was nothing but complete devastation<br>dead muscle showers everywhere and they<br>were fresh because they were still green<br>and in front was muscles<br>so i always think about and i think of<br>sea stars they're chemo receptors they<br>sense their<br>prey and you know like you're teenagers<br>when there's food in the fridge and they<br>just go like oh zombies<br>and they go like that and that's how i<br>explain sea stars to<br>our younger children they sense their<br>food<br>and they just go and get it and what<br>they did was leave behind devastation<br>at in that bed of sea stars there were<br>112<br>i know 1.2 million sea stars it was<br>about a full hectare bed<br>which equated to around 672<br>i wish you could see my pictures because<br>they're really cool but never mind<br>fast forward to 2019<br>and way back in 2007 we had four<br>traditional beds muscle bears in the<br>harbour<br>fast forward to 2019 and there's one bed<br>left<br>and there's approximately just under 80<br>000<br>muscles in the whole harbour so what we<br>did<br>was working with our evening partners as<br>well as three councils<br>we developed restoration stations<br>um a lot of uh some<br>when you look at this restoring muscles<br>i just want to say this isn't what i was<br>going to talk about tonight<br>by the way but um so<br>one of the methods of restoring muscles<br>people get um seconds from aquaculture<br>farms<br>and dump them on the bottom to see if<br>they will reattach and grow and have<br>babies<br>but we were voluntary for at that time<br>so we didn't have any money<br>so we decided that that was not an<br>option for us to buy muscles and dump<br>them<br>so actually one of the first questions<br>we wanted to know which our komatsu came<br>up with<br>was whakapapa or genealogy<br>if you want to have a population<br>don't you need to get pregnant or have<br>babies<br>so our food i don't know why i'm<br>freaking careful you know why<br>so we needed to know do our muscles need<br>to have a possibly<br>positively pregnant ab to reproduce or<br>to restore the muscle bed<br>and so i'm getting distracted i'll just<br>carry on<br>um oh muscles so we wanted to know<br>can our muscles have babies because<br>isn't that the first question you want<br>to know if you want a slower population<br>so we developed a series of<br>lines hanging in the water much like<br>aquaculture and muscle farms<br>and off those lines we talk mussels<br>from the i got this the yachts<br>the yachts and or harvard because<br>they're not like yachts in auckland<br>they're like your ass so um we dive<br>under those yards and um they have<br>mooring chains mooring lines and we took<br>the muscles off those<br>and we got the chains we allowed the<br>chains and we hung them on floats in the<br>water<br>and then we've got mussels fat lines<br>which aquaculture and mussel farms use<br>and we hung those to see can we grow can<br>we grow our own mussels and our harbour<br>from our while we were doing that<br>we started to really look around some<br>industry lines that you use to grow<br>mussels and aquaculture<br>they're largely plastic based which<br>means they're naturally<br>i don't know if nature is the right word<br>but they are just releasing little bits<br>of microplastic pollution into the water<br>all the time so using mathorango maori<br>oh i need to say that all our<br>restoration stations were identified<br>positioned by our kaumatua using<br>intergenerational material<br>so we then developed natural resource<br>muscle lines made out of cabinetry<br>leaves<br>you know you know you know cabbage trees<br>and you know when the dead leaves fall<br>on the ground and then you know when you<br>go row your realms<br>and those and those deer leaves<br>wrap around your lawnmower but they<br>don't really die they don't just break<br>up<br>that means they're awesomely fibrous so<br>and our people used to use them for<br>generations for lots of<br>for lots of reasons so we use ticoca<br>that's what we call cabbage tree the<br>fallen leaf<br>the bio waste and with that bio waste<br>we using traditional weaving methods<br>made natural resource muscle lines out<br>of cabbage trees<br>free totally free we didn't oh just<br>that's it for the energy to make them<br>we also made lines out of flax and<br>other materials i'm just like i'm going<br>um the great thing was was that our<br>lines our natural resource lines or toda<br>total um you know where mussels grow on<br>the bottom on a soft bottom they grow<br>i don't know why i do this but they grow<br>like a family as a farmer they grow<br>clumps they re they don't normally grow<br>as individuals so they grow as a farming<br>so if you have natural resource lines<br>eventually it will biodegrade dissipate<br>out and the muscles they have attached<br>will fall<br>as a whanau and reattach on the bottom<br>of the harbour<br>as a whanau i mean brilliant<br>if i say so myself and that's what<br>happened<br>talked<br>and so our lines have been really<br>successful we've had two generation of<br>lines we're now moving into the third<br>generation<br>this year and i don't know what else to<br>say<br>um and so i'm going to stop cause i feel<br>like i've just raved at you for a sweet<br>sorry<br>right so the technician's name belting<br>back up to turn my company and probably<br>hear me without anyone<br>um thank you for actually just goes to<br>show you don't need slides<br>that was that was brilliant thank you<br>very much um<br>so we've got some time for questions<br>several questions have been coming in<br>through slido if anybody's on to slido<br>you find that you can<br>um i believe the correct term is up vote<br>you can up<br>vote questions if you're if you can ask<br>do that question otherwise i'm just<br>going to sort of train through<br>and pass questions over to yourself<br>so that there's several questions here<br>though<br>quite clearly from our academic staff<br>talking about um<br>various reward metrics for academics we<br>may come back to those if we have time<br>but i suspect that might be a<br>conversation over a glass of wine<br>um so let's<br>let's kick off with a fairly leading<br>question<br>actually um this would have been<br>possibly a more leading question if ian<br>was able to make it tonight because ian<br>is also from the division<br>of um asp what does that have to stand<br>for<br>arts social science and psychology all<br>so the question is which is more<br>valuable<br>very leading question i think<br>so who would like to jump into into that<br>creating<br>i think it's an interesting question so<br>so my background is very much from an<br>engineering stem background but in my<br>role as dvcr<br>i get to stick my beak into all sorts of<br>people's research<br>shall i love these talks so much um<br>and i thought i was an interdisciplinary<br>researcher before i got here and then i<br>actually saw the genuine<br>of interdisciplinary research and for me<br>the question is loaded because it<br>assumes there is more valuable less<br>valuable but either or both<br>i think is exactly the right answer um<br>in each of your your cases you've<br>discussed uh sort of an<br>interdisciplinary approach<br>to things that's blended not just<br>mathematics and<br>knowledge system but knowledge systems<br>that come from the arts from the<br>sciences they're all<br>they're all different knowledge systems<br>as well so so<br>in terms of interdisciplinarity um<br>how did you get there how did you get to<br>the interdisciplinary<br>place that you're coming from now you<br>know you've got you've got programming<br>you've got<br>an institutional approach to<br>environmental sciences you're blending<br>material<br>and western science and coming up with<br>amazing<br>transformations all of you so how did<br>or for me anyway the goal is to try to<br>figure out something<br>that will help people you have to just<br>bring in<br>whatever ideas might work and<br>work together with the people who have<br>that knowledge<br>in order to make that happen so you know<br>it's about what's the goal<br>i suppose that's it yeah i mean<br>the also sampler is purely um it's built<br>by engineers i didn't build it<br>and you know it was necessity that sort<br>of led me along that path to<br>creating it well-being being<br>driving driving its its<br>design and manufacture but um it's<br>working with<br>the diverse number of colleagues who<br>have the right skills that<br>has enabled that to happen so yeah it's<br>really the<br>um i think the world's holistic and i<br>think we<br>live in silos i don't think you know you<br>know when you're<br>i've got five children and so you know<br>when one of them finally is sitting the<br>table<br>they're not just doing math they're<br>doing math by counting how many people<br>have to sit at the table<br>and then we're doing english or whatever<br>language you're talking about when you<br>try to get out of it and weasel and<br>negotiate<br>with your siblings why you shouldn't be<br>doing it<br>but and then there's also like food and<br>you're<br>probably going to sing it when they're<br>doing it isn't the world holistic<br>like yeah<br>that's interdisciplinary translation<br>multi-disciplinary<br>the more we share and work with each<br>other the better for ourselves<br>and our world i love the word holistic i<br>think that's a very good word for it<br>yeah<br>far better than arguing about the<br>difference between interdisciplinarity<br>and trans disciplinarity which is a<br>whole different rabbit hole<br>um there's a follow-up question um just<br>arrived about the same sort of topic<br>really has your ecological work<br>had an additional social impact of<br>uniting and empowering<br>the eastern bay ue and communities<br>what was the field was it hasn't has it<br>has it has your home because you've been<br>working that sort of very environmental<br>space but<br>has there been a social impact about<br>uniting the people in that community as<br>well<br>yes there has it's been fantastic like i<br>said there are four<br>ewe we also work with the three councils<br>two district councils and a regional<br>council as well as<br>to on the periphery's department of<br>conservation<br>we work with the kurukai proper on both<br>sides of the<br>harbour as well as the high school we<br>train<br>youth and we also work with the regional<br>council with these summer internships<br>um so there it's all about i guess it<br>goes back to the previous question<br>and i guess one a really important thing<br>is which i was going to talk about<br>tonight<br>was about how do we um<br>how do we build capacitive capability<br>capacity<br>but<br>or whatever type of ecology biology<br>ology you're doing<br>how do our how does the next generation<br>get access to that<br>how what does that look like so really<br>that's a big and for maori<br>that succession is everything it's the<br>next generation coming through<br>short answer yes there's a there's a<br>question that follows up to that that we<br>can then pass over to youtube as well<br>but it builds on that<br>each work do you do or would you like to<br>do particularly with schools to engage<br>in with your research is there something<br>that you're already doing or is there<br>something that you could envisage doing<br>with the local schools here or further<br>afield<br>i'm not sure i heard the very first part<br>of what you were saying but but<br>but thinking of that i mean thinking<br>about all this<br>makes one of the things that i think can<br>be a barrier to that<br>to to developing these kinds of projects<br>or to doing interdisciplinary researches<br>is speaking is to is when we get into<br>those little silos<br>when you just learn this one way of<br>doing things then you don't have<br>then you can't communicate with the<br>people who are doing it the other way<br>i had a little bit of that well i think<br>the most<br>the thing that made me ate us able to<br>to develop this app was finding a for<br>example a programmer<br>who would i could communicate with who i<br>could explain<br>what do i want and that he could<br>understand and<br>talk back you know that communicating<br>across those<br>those worldview lines and we can get<br>too easily into those in our different<br>workplaces<br>so the more we have the idea of all of<br>those<br>contributions i think the more you can<br>get interesting things done<br>and and and i don't know it seems like<br>it starts earlier and earlier<br>now in school that you know your 16 year<br>old's supposed to know what they want to<br>do when they're<br>you know and or decide when they're in<br>year nine<br>and that's sort of getting people into<br>channels i suppose i come from a<br>background where there's sort of more<br>broad holistic education<br>may enable people to actually talk to<br>each other better<br>do you do you get the opportunity to get<br>i have not very few of us find the time<br>yeah um<br>it's hard you get a chance i i would<br>love to do yeah<br>it's just an open day really yeah yeah<br>did you get a chance to get out<br>no i haven't been into schools like<br>sort of as an adversary or but we've had<br>uh school students visit university<br>recently yeah and um<br>been able to work with students from<br>college oh yeah um who came<br>we took out on waikato river and took<br>samples of water and we<br>they're investigating the effects of<br>acidification<br>it's coming from carbon dioxide so co2<br>goes out of the atmosphere it's water<br>and makes it more acidic<br>and they're interested in exploring<br>that's part of their<br>their studies for ncaa but there are<br>lots of opportunities<br>and pathways for that engagement but as<br>you say<br>time is the greatest commodity that none<br>of us have<br>enough of and so<br>having the the um having the opportunity<br>to do that is<br>it's it's um it's about i guess how we<br>manage our time<br>but yeah it'd be good to do more it's<br>interesting because for me<br>how we speak to the next generation of<br>researchers coming through<br>is another aspect of impact and today's<br>talk was all about<br>impact really and how we are changing<br>the world so there's a very good<br>question here<br>recently i heard a leading nz researcher<br>argue that we shouldn't be discussing<br>impact<br>because researchers can't control this<br>we should be talking about<br>initiating research so what are your<br>thoughts on where<br>there's a very we'll concentrate on us<br>as university researchers too in<br>answering this<br>where do university researchers where<br>should they sit<br>can you say that what did you think<br>the argument is possibly that we can't<br>control<br>the impact of our research because<br>impact is long-term so<br>should we even concern ourselves with it<br>or should we simply concern ourselves<br>with<br>initiating the research where do we sit<br>on the spectrum of starting it to seeing<br>its endpoint<br>uh i think it's a continuum like um<br>another thing i was going to talk about<br>today was co-innovating<br>in terms of initiating like we just<br>talked earlier about working with<br>schools we actually build that into our<br>research<br>design and so i thank you when you work<br>with a<br>across disciplines if you like<br>then you're in a position to co-innovate<br>and when you co-innovate<br>then research has to be meaningful<br>or what's the point if it's not useful<br>if it doesn't assist<br>someone or something why are we doing it<br>so the co-innovation comes from there<br>and then our research we then lead it<br>action management plans or into policy<br>so<br>i think it's a continuum i think that<br>there is i agree<br>about the initiating and co-innovating<br>and co-designing but i also think there<br>has to be what's the point of doing all<br>this<br>if it's not meaningful and then for in<br>our space<br>we're looking at decision-making tools<br>for ewe to be able to contribute<br>and participate to management regimes so<br>policy and stuff so i i<br>that was kind of a tricky question it<br>was a very tricky question<br>so where do you two sit on the um you're<br>just going to sit in your office and<br>think deep thoughts<br>or are you gonna get out there and<br>change the world or<br>where are you where are you sitting on<br>it<br>um i i think that i started off as an<br>academic<br>being purely driven by my own interests<br>and you know i saw something the other<br>day<br>someone talking about palliative climate<br>science which is the study of<br>past climate states and the reason why<br>people study that<br>and it's really comes from a place of<br>nerdiness that's the main reason that we<br>do this<br>but it is actually super relevant for<br>understanding<br>the climate changes we're experiencing<br>now and<br>trying to model and predict that for the<br>future so<br>there is definitely an applied and an<br>impact that comes from it<br>um but the that in that continuum<br>our role you know we can excuse me we<br>can generate knowledge we can<br>communicate it<br>and we can work with other organization<br>stakeholders governments to try and<br>implement things into policy and see<br>some effects of change but we are only<br>one part of that<br>so yeah yeah i mean i think there is<br>there is a spectrum from<br>very theoretical trying to figure out<br>and understand how the world works<br>um which is important you may not know<br>what the endpoint is going to be there<br>but it's still important<br>and to to apply i i mean i<br>tend toward the applied and trying to<br>figure out<br>but that's but there's a but if we<br>didn't have some of these theoretical<br>people then we wouldn't be able to<br>make those applications later so this<br>just don't<br>i think the the beauty of working in<br>university is we're aboard church<br>and then we have the whole range of<br>researchers<br>within our university and and we're very<br>fortunate to do so so we do get to have<br>conversations that span<br>the entire impact timeline<br>shall we say and somebody has actually<br>asked and it's got at least one upload<br>here<br>i think geological time yeah<br>actually yeah i think so um<br>i um again there was a post on twitter<br>actually so<br>apologies for that but there was a<br>someone who's a<br>science communicator on climate change<br>and saying that we actually have had<br>have all the science we need to be able<br>to start<br>acting on climate change that we don't<br>need to<br>do more research in order to motivate<br>ourselves to do so<br>um so impact<br>is yeah who knows but you know the<br>evidence is there that we need<br>to make changes on every level of<br>society<br>um and so yeah it's an open question as<br>to whether or not<br>when we will you know at large<br>governments and<br>a society implements what science has<br>been telling us for decades<br>interestingly bringing us back to the<br>initial question about which is more<br>important humanities or science research<br>um having one without the other means<br>that neither are important<br>having both is where it's at yeah<br>because the science tells us<br>um the physical basis for our you know<br>why yeah um<br>what are you going to do with it yeah<br>but put people into it that's what my<br>thoughts<br>and warfare that's right so a few very<br>specific questions then<br>um one of you how do you address the sea<br>style predation<br>oh good question<br>we actually have a uh we actually have a<br>project with sustainability's national<br>science challenge<br>and one of the first questions is why<br>are there so many sisters<br>and how do we manage them because<br>they're native like they meant to be<br>here<br>some people at home have quite a few<br>actually have said oh<br>um you just need to call them just kill<br>them<br>kill them all off kill them did i<br>emphasize that enough<br>i'm not sure if you got it and so<br>but we can't kill them dead because<br>they're meant to be here<br>they are native species to aotearoa new<br>zealand so that means<br>they have their own mana and their own<br>modi<br>so i guess some of the questions we have<br>a phd student here from wakato who<br>is trying looking at that and we<br>co-develop<br>her research with our ewe partners and<br>our council<br>partners as well and and so in short<br>answer<br>they're over abundant and they're kind<br>so are they edible are they edible yeah<br>oh we've had that conversation i think<br>only leading forward i think we should<br>have a cook-off<br>i don't know why it's like seriously<br>i've got soy sauce<br>but um you don't really know some people<br>say yes but um<br>i'll have a try and there's a difference<br>between edible and nice as well so<br>that's yeah<br>a specific question for you carrie that<br>that app does it<br>address the issues of how others<br>sometimes negatively treat pregnant<br>women<br>an example in the know yourself section<br>um<br>would be things like you know are they<br>hysterical are they fragile don't they<br>belong in this public space<br>does the app address those questions it<br>in some of the<br>those find out bits it talks a bit about<br>that and about how you know people<br>suddenly<br>everybody has an opinion about things<br>and you know sort of just coping with<br>those things comments on the law i<br>wouldn't say there's a lot but it's yeah<br>it's<br>an experience that many people have that<br>suddenly your body becomes a public<br>place yeah yeah and a good suggestion<br>that came out earlier actually for the<br>partner app<br>is is that it should wake your partner<br>up every time you have to get up to go<br>to the loan<br>so um well we'd expect to see that a<br>little bit<br>um so one specific question for you adam<br>speleothem research<br>these things take thousands and<br>thousands and thousands of years to grow<br>and are you cutting them up with them<br>yeah is that<br>good well<br>um so it's kind of a necessary part of<br>the process<br>so that's um i guess i don't want to try<br>and defend<br>the uh the dissection of spirit attempts<br>as a practice but it is<br>necessary part of doing kind of research<br>um<br>however there are people who um<br>researchers who have<br>gone through that process of removing a<br>safe side by doing the doing the<br>analysis<br>and then um either returning that sample<br>to the cave or<br>creating a sort of um a mock-up or like<br>a cast of it<br>and putting it in the cave and and in<br>the long run<br>no one would not be any wiser given that<br>they are<br>you know continuously growing yeah so<br>you know give it a thousand years or so<br>every night that's that's how long<br>impacted<br>the end of s time here there's plenty<br>more questions we could go out so so<br>we'll draw a line under it there but i<br>will just hand it over to yourself if<br>there's any last thing<br>you'd like to share then i'd invite you<br>to do so<br>now in the context of public bang for<br>i think that the um the pursuit of<br>impact<br>um is can it can be counter productive<br>um as scientists as researchers i should<br>say sorry we spend a lot of the time our<br>time<br>trying to sort of demonstrate the merits<br>of our research we spend a lot of time<br>applying for funding<br>to go about doing research and huge<br>amounts of unproductive effort go into<br>that exercise every year<br>and uh that model isn't necessarily the<br>best it's<br>it's it's one solution but it's not<br>necessarily the best<br>and i think that the auto sampler is an<br>example of<br>what can be done with the modest amount<br>of funding and with time<br>because i've been i've been recipient<br>and had the benefit of having a<br>fellowship from the government which<br>means that i don't have to do<br>as much teaching as other academics and<br>so on and that's<br>that time and modest amount of funding<br>allows for<br>the sort of the full cycle of research<br>to take place it doesn't just happen it<br>takes a long time<br>and that includes developing<br>relationships and working with a lot of<br>people<br>and having lots of challenges and<br>pitfalls along the way to get to the end<br>and so<br>having more unconstrained funding<br>not necessarily increasing the amount<br>funding but changing the way that we<br>distribute it and<br>probably benefit okay<br>very thoughtful thank you carrie well i<br>think that's a good point i think that<br>you know having the time the space and<br>and the time to make connections with<br>with all of those<br>colleagues people in the community to<br>get that input back<br>is really valuable and it's not gonna<br>happen<br>overnight two three years it takes take<br>it<br>always i actually tell my students<br>always to think about how long<br>calculate how long you think this<br>project is going to take and then<br>and it'll take twice that long after<br>you've taken that<br>even after you've taken that into<br>account it always takes four times as<br>long as you think it's going to take<br>this is right or it even should take so<br>all of our all of the projects all the<br>research that we do<br>we do with the home people<br>all around the country and the greatest<br>i think of talking about impact the<br>greatest success for us<br>is that the people that we have worked<br>with the one<br>that whatever our findings are they're<br>useful<br>they're meaningful and it helps them to<br>make better decisions to better<br>understand<br>care for and manage their marine spaces<br>and two and arguably<br>um the most important i think is that<br>they're glad to have been part of the<br>research<br>no matter how long it took if it was<br>well it never takes two weeks<br>if it was three years ten years we've<br>done one project we're coming up to 14<br>years<br>and because you if your relationships<br>are there<br>if you put that time and effort into the<br>people it's the people<br>that will look after the land the water<br>so for us that is one of the most<br>fundamental aspects of all of our<br>research<br>is making space for the people in order<br>to ensure that our oceans<br>and our grandchildren have a future for<br>tomorrow<br>thank you so i would like to say thank<br>you<br>thank you thank you nami that was a<br>really interesting and engaging<br>conversation i invite you all to join me<br>in thanking our speakers one last<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
