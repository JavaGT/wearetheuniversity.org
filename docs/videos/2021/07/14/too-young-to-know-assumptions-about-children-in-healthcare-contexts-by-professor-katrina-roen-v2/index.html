Assumptions about children in healthcare contexts' - by Professor Katrina Roen v2" style="width: 100%;"><div class="tags"></div><h2>Description</h2><p>Healthcare has historically taken a paternalistic approach, especially with regard to children and young people. The growth in patient advocacy and client centred care in recent decades has brought about significant changes, but not necessarily where children are concerned.<br><br>Nowadays, children and young people who express significant distress in relation to their gender may have access to gender affirming health care interventions. This means that some trans-youth have a meaningful say in their healthcare at least from the time of puberty. For children and young people who have a variation in sex characteristics, the story can be very different. Some find themselves involved in treatment plans that were not of their choosing and this can have lifelong implications.<br><br>This public lecture by Professor Katrina Roen addresses dilemmas that arise when healthcare meets sexuality, gender and the sexed body.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100%

i will<br>continue in english<br>and i'm speaking here to people in the<br>audience who many of you can see<br>i'm also speaking to people on zoom who<br>might not be used to maori introductions<br>so that's fine explaining myself a<br>how<br>i grew up in christchurch as you've<br>heard<br>and as a child in the south island i<br>experienced a lot of going<br>fishing and boating a lot of holidays<br>with extended family<br>i spent time with my grandparents aunts<br>uncles cousins and one of the things i<br>remember very clearly<br>is the time i spent on the water i loved<br>boating<br>and i still do i remember my grandfather<br>teaching me how to tie a fishhook onto<br>the line<br>and i also remember him teaching me how<br>to drive the boat<br>which i might have to do as a child if<br>he fell overboard<br>these kinds of things were ordinary<br>things for children and our family to<br>learn<br>if we were involved in boating and<br>fishing our gender did not matter<br>in this regard i would have been about<br>eight or nine and i remember<br>digging with helping some adults to dig<br>um<br>in the backyard and at the end of this<br>digging task one of the men in my family<br>turned to me and said<br>i was good at digging for a girl<br>i don't actually remember what i felt in<br>relation to that comment but i do<br>remember what happened next<br>my mother said and no uncertain terms<br>that<br>my being a girl was not relevant to my<br>i learnt two things in that moment i<br>learnt that<br>i could be profoundly underestimated<br>misunderstood<br>in relation to my gender and we have to<br>learn that<br>it's not obvious why should it be so<br>in that interaction i also learned that<br>it's possible to speak<br>out about these things when we are<br>the opportunity for children and young<br>people to speak<br>out about things that matter to them as<br>something that runs through my research<br>this is a theme i can see now that i<br>look back over the past 20 years but it<br>wasn't a theme i set out to follow<br>i began principally with an interest and<br>how we make sense<br>of who we are how we engage<br>understandings about<br>sex gender of sexuality and how we make<br>sense of our bodies in that context<br>i also began with questions about health<br>and well-being<br>questions about how psychomedical<br>discourses<br>produce particular understandings about<br>us<br>as gendered and sexual human beings<br>and as i read i saw again<br>and again examples where academic<br>literature<br>seemed to put forward ideas about people<br>without necessarily consulting<br>those people it didn't seem to matter<br>too much what i was reading<br>whether i was reading psychological<br>literature on trans people<br>whether i was reading suicide research<br>about young people<br>or reading self-harm research about<br>lgbt youth or medical literature about<br>people with intersex variations<br>no matter what i read i kept seeing<br>examples of research literature that<br>framed people in ways that seemed to me<br>to be<br>i kept encountering academic literature<br>that pronounced knowledge<br>about groups of people without robustly<br>engaging those people<br>without engaging in dialogue without<br>listening to them<br>to their voices their stories<br>this concern has led me into this<br>interdisciplinary field<br>this space that i've depicted with three<br>overlapping shapes here<br>and this is where i've spent most of my<br>time as a researcher<br>asking people about their experiences to<br>find out how they make sense<br>of gender identity the sexed body and<br>sexuality among other things<br>so today i'm going to speak about three<br>particular research areas that<br>sit at this intersection<br>all of this research sorry<br>so firstly most of my research on the<br>topic of youth suicide<br>was done in collaboration with liz<br>mcdermott at lancaster university<br>over 10 years of collaboration we<br>listened to the way that young people<br>spoke about the topic of suicide<br>we listened to their stories of<br>their experience of feeling suicidal and<br>also sometimes their experience of using<br>self-harm with the view that it might<br>stop them becoming suicidal<br>when we began reading the research<br>literature together we noticed<br>three things that really concerned us<br>we noticed that the existing research<br>literature<br>tended to frame people and pathologizing<br>terms if they engaged in self-harming<br>or suicide we also noticed that<br>the existing research literature focused<br>very heavily on population level data<br>it identified risk groups and it didn't<br>really explore<br>the experiences of distress that lay<br>behind<br>finally we noticed that even though<br>there is good<br>evidence that lgbt youth have<br>particularly high rates of self-harm and<br>suicidality<br>existing suicide prevention strategies<br>tended to overlook<br>lgbt youth altogether<br>the research that we carried out in<br>collaboration with colleagues and<br>students over the years produced a body<br>of work that's very focused<br>on the experiences and interpretations<br>of young people<br>with a view to presenting this and<br>non-pathologizing ways<br>over time we came to focus particularly<br>on the narratives of<br>lgbt youth highlighting life experiences<br>such as homophobic biphobic and<br>transphobic abuse<br>which was happening for them at home and<br>at school<br>these kinds of abuse based on prejudice<br>are things that sometimes lead to<br>homelessness<br>and often impact on educational outcomes<br>we could not see any benefit in<br>pathologising the young people who face<br>this kind of adversity<br>in fact failing to listen to their<br>stories<br>reducing them to statistics and<br>psychiatric labels<br>seems to me certain to add to<br>rather than reducing the stigma that<br>they face<br>so our research contributes to a wider<br>body of work that now<br>advocates for the inclusion of lgbt<br>youth<br>in suicide prevention programs among<br>so moving on to the second topic i'm<br>going to talk about<br>i started researching trans identities<br>as a phd student in the 1990s<br>i traveled around aotearoa and new<br>zealand interviewing trans people<br>with a view to producing narratives of<br>trans identity and embodiment<br>that contrasted with the academic<br>literature<br>at the time in the academic literature<br>trans people<br>were fairly exclusively<br>described in relation to psychiatric<br>diagnostic terms<br>and rarely presented as valid subjects<br>who could speak for themselves<br>thankfully<br>since that time a lot has changed and<br>there are now<br>numerous trans researchers and journals<br>that publish<br>articles where trans voices are heard<br>in more recent years i've been in<br>dialogue with a number of psychologists<br>who specialise in working with<br>children and young people who question<br>the gender to which they've been<br>assigned at birth<br>so that is children who are born<br>male and then as they grow do not<br>identify as boys<br>or children who are born female and then<br>some of us working in this space have<br>noticed that there is still a tendency<br>to<br>think of gender and binary terms<br>to assume that if a person doesn't feel<br>comfortable<br>in one gender that they must simply<br>belong to<br>the other agenda<br>some of my work engages with clinical<br>psychologists<br>where we are trying to support a genuine<br>openness to diverse gendered<br>possibilities<br>focusing particularly on healthcare<br>settings and thinking about how this<br>could work best for young people<br>so the intention is to open up space for<br>children and young people<br>and also adults to express the gender<br>they experience<br>rather than only being offered the kind<br>of health care that's about<br>fitting people into binary gender<br>whether or not that's how they actually<br>feel<br>so the point is to promote health and<br>well-being<br>to affirm people's experience of<br>themselves<br>rather than fitting people into social<br>norms<br>what i want to spend most time talking<br>with you about this evening<br>is my current research and this relates<br>to a third topic<br>that i've barely mentioned yet before i<br>give this topic a name<br>i want to tell you a story about someone<br>who we will call<br>tanya when tanya was an<br>infant there were medical issues that<br>led her to undergo surgery<br>it was something to do with her<br>reproductive organs<br>her parents felt intensely uncomfortable<br>about this issue so they didn't talk to<br>anyone about it<br>the doctor did explain it to them at the<br>time but it was something that they'd<br>never heard of before<br>and it had a pretty scary sounding<br>medical name<br>tanya's parents didn't even talk to<br>tanya about this over the years<br>as she grew they knew that they would<br>have to one day<br>but they mostly wanted her to just have<br>as she grew they realized that they<br>wanted less and less to worry their<br>child<br>about something that had happened years<br>before they figured it was best to put<br>tanya however always knew that there was<br>something<br>wrong with her something her parents<br>didn't want to talk about<br>she knew that she had been in hospital<br>when she was much younger<br>she knew they had done some surgery down<br>there<br>and she didn't know much more than that<br>but she had a persistent feeling<br>something just wasn't right if her<br>parents didn't want to tell her what it<br>was<br>maybe they were trying to protect her<br>from something terrible<br>sometimes she wondered if she was going<br>to die but mostly she didn't want to<br>tanya's story is shared by many people<br>two persistent features of stories like<br>this are<br>silence and distress silence as<br>in this is not something i was told<br>about myself<br>this is too shameful to speak about and<br>i don't even have words for this if i<br>did want to speak about it<br>silence as in we will never be able to<br>speak about this as a family<br>even though it's touched all of us<br>deeply<br>the kinds of distress that are woven<br>through this<br>narrative are the distress of not being<br>told what's happening to one's own body<br>the distress of not being involved in<br>health care decisions<br>that have a lifelong impact and the<br>distress of never seeing one's own<br>reality reflected<br>because almost everyone who has a<br>similar experience is keeping quiet<br>about it<br>in this context i suggest that silence<br>leads to distress<br>and distress leads to silence<br>the topic i'm referring to is sometimes<br>called intersex<br>in medical terms it gets called<br>disorders of sex development<br>though many who engage in health care<br>and health research<br>say differences in sex development in<br>recent years there's been a move towards<br>the term variations and sex<br>characteristics<br>but it remains the case that no matter<br>which of these terms i use<br>i will inevitably alienate some of the<br>people<br>that i would like to be in dialogue with<br>i'm going to give you a whole lot more<br>terms in the moment and these are<br>diagnostic terms which<br>probably more alienating than any of the<br>others but i'll put them there just for<br>information<br>i'm committed to being in dialogue with<br>health professionals who can make a real<br>difference to people's lives<br>health professionals who want to do the<br>best job they can to promote health and<br>well-being<br>i'm also committed to being in dialogue<br>with people who may have a diagnosis<br>perhaps one of these diagnoses who may<br>have a variation in sex<br>characteristics and who may identify as<br>intersex<br>there are many ways that our physical<br>development can diverge from<br>male and female norms many<br>chromosomal hormonal and anatomical<br>variations it's suggested that at least<br>1.7 percent of the population has such a<br>variation<br>so it's very likely that there are more<br>than 200 people at this university with<br>variations<br>and maybe around 85 000 people in<br>so i want to tell you about one thread<br>of this research that i'm carrying out<br>with colleagues<br>this thread relates to the topic<br>of talking about this topic<br>and it relies on our being able to<br>listen very carefully to what young<br>people<br>say about their experience<br>i'm going to show you some quotations<br>from our interview data<br>these interviews were carried out as<br>part of the sense<br>project in this project we're interested<br>in how people make sense<br>of the medical interventions carried out<br>on children with variations in sex<br>characteristics<br>the medical interventions relevant here<br>include<br>surgery on genital and reproductive<br>organs this is surgery that<br>is often done in infancy and<br>it also includes hormonal treatments<br>the medical treatment can<br>often happens in infancy but also can<br>happen throughout childhood<br>and and youth this research i'm talking<br>about here<br>is located in scandinavia and the uk<br>where we interviewed health<br>professionals who work in specialist<br>teams doing this kind of medical<br>intervention<br>a key part of the research was carried<br>out by torva lundberg in the context of<br>her doctoral studies<br>she interviewed parents and young people<br>who had personal experience of these<br>medical interventions<br>so our interviews with health<br>professionals parents and young<br>people produced a large body of data but<br>i'm just going to focus today on the<br>question of<br>how young people are told about their<br>diagnosis<br>their treatment their body any aspect of<br>medical specialists in leading european<br>centres<br>are willing to acknowledge that there<br>are difficulties and inconsistencies and<br>how children and young people get given<br>information<br>clinicians explained that this isn't<br>consistent there are various concerns<br>although disclosing information to a<br>child or a young person<br>is seen as important the uh<br>the clarity about how to do it when to<br>do it who does it<br>is is just not there one clinician said<br>for instance it's assumed<br>that the child absorbs by osmosis what<br>has happened to them<br>so children can be there in the<br>discussion there in the clinic they're<br>coming repeatedly for hospital visits<br>but it's not clear that someone<br>routinely sits down and explains things<br>before we go any further i'm going to<br>have to check in with you because this<br>is a point where<br>there's often some confusion between<br>the topic i talked about before which<br>was trans identities<br>and the topic i'm talking about now<br>so the distinction here with regard to<br>trans identities i was talking about<br>gender identity<br>i was talking about a person's sense of<br>being a girl or a boy or non-binary for<br>instance<br>but now i'm talking about variations in<br>sex characteristics<br>so i'm talking about bodily features<br>that relate to anatomy chromosomes<br>hormones<br>the reason i'm checking in with you<br>about that is because i'm about to show<br>you<br>a piece of data where we're actually<br>talking about puberty induction<br>so i'm still talking about variations<br>and sex characteristics<br>this is an instance where a person might<br>not<br>be able to produce their own hormones<br>that would<br>would move the body into puberty and so<br>there will be medical intervention<br>to induce puberty this is what we were<br>discussing in this particular interview<br>where i asked a medical<br>specialist about the clinical ethics the<br>ethical implications of this<br>if puberty is being induced<br>but actually no one in the medical team<br>is really talking with the young person<br>in terms they understand about what is<br>happening<br>in what way are they consenting to that<br>treatment is what i asked<br>and the response was absolute agreement<br>i think that's a very valid point<br>i think we haven't addressed that yet we<br>discuss it with the parents<br>we get their consent we don't<br>technically get the child's consent for<br>the treatment<br>so the responsibility for talking with<br>children about their health related<br>issues is left up to the guardians<br>usually the parents<br>and there's little to no support given<br>to those adults<br>who take on that quite tricky task<br>many of the parents we interviewed said<br>that it's not easy for them to know<br>when and how to talk about these things<br>with children<br>they acknowledged that this is a<br>difficult topic between parents and<br>children<br>they need some support to talk about<br>this or perhaps someone else to help<br>actually do it<br>some explained to us why they didn't<br>want to talk with their children at<br>certain points in the child's life<br>maybe relieving the child from stress<br>being concerned that this is too<br>distressing a topic to raise<br>some parents talked about being afraid<br>to bother<br>their child with this topic at all<br>one said for instance that<br>raise the topic with his daughter<br>because he said i don't want to start<br>putting thoughts in her head<br>so you can see examples here where there<br>are opportunities for at least some<br>children and young people to be going<br>through medical interventions not just<br>in infancy but after that as well<br>where no one's actually talking to them<br>on the other hand there are certainly<br>parents<br>who do an admirable job of finding<br>opportunities<br>tackling difficult topics and having<br>these conversations with their children<br>as they are growing<br>i'm focusing more on the instances where<br>this doesn't work<br>because i'm suggesting maybe there<br>should be some processes in place to<br>young people that we spoke with said<br>for example i think i was 14 when i got<br>told the full diagnosis<br>i asked for it when i was at the<br>doctor's so there's an example<br>someone who got to the age of 14 quite<br>possibly parents had known about it<br>for 14 years by then and this young<br>person had to proactively ask<br>another person said in an ideal world<br>the doctor would have asked me<br>would you like me to tell you to talk to<br>your parents or both of you together<br>and i would have said i'd like to talk<br>to you alone<br>so here's a young person responding to<br>that dilemma that parents froze too<br>that this is a difficult topic between<br>parents and children<br>so we might think okay so let's<br>get health professionals to more<br>proactively mediate this conversation<br>but wait another person says i probably<br>blocked quite a lot of doubt<br>i can't really remember what they said<br>they just defined the term<br>ais androgen and sensitivity syndrome<br>i see syndrome as quite a derogatory<br>thing<br>so i have concerns about the suggestion<br>that health professionals should be the<br>ones to mediate this topic<br>because health professionals will often<br>bring in diagnostic terminology<br>the terms that i'm referring to is<br>pathologising and that clearly<br>at least some young people find<br>derogatory<br>so i'm suggesting there's room for<br>improvement and how adults talk with<br>children and young people about<br>variations in sex characteristics and<br>about the medical treatment that often<br>some children are involved in treatment<br>over a period of years<br>starting in infancy and if there is no<br>consistent or reliable approach to<br>talking with<br>the child in age-appropriate ways about<br>what is happening<br>then it's likely to mean that at least<br>some children<br>and young people go through medical<br>interventions with only limited<br>understanding about what is happening<br>and why<br>it's also likely to mean that the only<br>understanding a young person can glean<br>is a medically based understanding so by<br>the time they're old enough<br>to make their own legally make their own<br>health care decisions<br>they'll most often be making those<br>decisions in the absence of<br>broader understandings about how people<br>live<br>with variations with bodily variations<br>of any sort<br>how one might experience variations in<br>terms of uniqueness and value<br>rather than just experiencing it in<br>terms of diagnosis and treatment<br>even when young people are old enough to<br>in principle have a say<br>in their health care and practice if<br>they've not been<br>socialized into this process of thinking<br>and<br>talking about their bodies and<br>non-medicalised ways<br>then i would say they're unlikely to be<br>able to fully engage in healthcare<br>decisions anyway<br>even if they are technically old enough<br>this raises the question who talks with<br>children<br>who's responsible for teaching children<br>to talk about their bodies at<br>all who's responsible for socializing<br>children and young people who have a<br>medical diagnosis<br>into understanding their bodies and<br>let's back up a little bit here let's<br>think about what it means to talk about<br>when a bodily variation is framed in<br>medical terms<br>people are more likely to regard that<br>variation as a problem that needs to be<br>fixed<br>they're more likely to seek a medical<br>solution to the problem<br>alternatively framing a bodily variation<br>in non-medical terms can lead people to<br>find<br>other creative ways of making sense of<br>the difference<br>this is a relational emotional process<br>not just a medical process<br>we're all involved in making sense of<br>our bodies<br>making sense of who we are making sense<br>of how we're different from one another<br>i'm sure that everyone listening can<br>think of something about your body<br>that you regard as a little different it<br>might be a different that is not visible<br>to anyone else<br>it might be a different that you're a<br>little uncomfortable about<br>it might be a difference that other<br>people comment on<br>now suppose that any aspect of those<br>differences that we're imagining<br>any aspect of those differences between<br>us suppose they could be framed<br>medically<br>could be framed as a problem or<br>these differences could simply be under<br>understood as part of our human<br>uniqueness<br>something to be celebrated or at least<br>appreciated<br>our research involves standing outside<br>medicine and asking what do people<br>experience how do they make sense of<br>this<br>what kind of effect does it have on<br>their lives<br>what we see people experiencing is the<br>effect of medicalisation<br>medicalisation this process where an<br>aspect of our lives<br>an aspect of our bodies is framed in<br>medical terms<br>it's constructed as a medical problem is<br>medicalisation is particularly<br>interesting and powerful because of the<br>way it<br>often leaves us thinking that there is<br>no alternative<br>when our experience has been medicalised<br>it simply makes sense to think of<br>ourselves as sick<br>or as having a disorder as having a<br>syndrome<br>we live with these for our whole lives<br>with this idea<br>when this makes sense to us it can be<br>extremely difficult to find some<br>other way of making sense of our<br>experiences<br>so as a social researcher i'm interested<br>when health professionals work with<br>people who present with some kind of<br>bodily variation there is still work to<br>be done then to shift the language away<br>from medically centred and problematic<br>assumptions<br>and towards understandings that can help<br>the person to interpret<br>and experience the variation in<br>constructive ways<br>this means being able for example to<br>experience one's<br>sexual anatomy as something other<br>people who have variations of sex<br>characteristics and who have been<br>courageous enough to speak out about<br>this<br>now have very articulate and<br>sophisticated ways of reframing this<br>particular bodily experience<br>and communicating alternative<br>understandings using<br>social media international conferences<br>developing educational materials a whole<br>raft of work that has been done<br>some people doing this work describe<br>themselves as intersex advocates and it<br>is owing to them<br>that international human rights<br>organizations<br>now pay attention to the medicalisation<br>of<br>various human rights organizations have<br>spoken<br>out in recent years against this kind of<br>medical treatment<br>stating that it doesn't uphold the<br>rights of the child<br>and so far as children are too young to<br>consent to surgical<br>and hormonal intervention when it's<br>typical typically carried out<br>aotearoa new zealand has come to the<br>particular attention of the united<br>nations for this reason<br>we've been charged by the united nations<br>committee for the human<br>rights of the child to change how we<br>treat<br>children and young people medically with<br>variations of sex characteristics<br>the new zealand government has now had<br>more than four years to respond to the<br>united nations<br>on this issue this year the<br>um the final report is due back<br>and it is far from clear that change is<br>afoot<br>in relation to medical interventions<br>so where do we go from here<br>my next steps in this research will be<br>to<br>open opportunities for creating new<br>understandings that make<br>sense in this particular cultural<br>location here<br>understandings that are empowering not<br>pathologising<br>i think there's potential here for maori<br>intersex<br>voices and maori models of health and<br>well-being<br>to play a key part i hope to do research<br>that helps develop our thinking about<br>what it might mean<br>to respect bodily integrity and<br>engage children and young people in age<br>appropriate conversations about health<br>care<br>internationally when researchers have<br>asked<br>children and young people whether they<br>want to know<br>about health-related issues that affect<br>them<br>even if that means hearing about<br>difficult and distressing issues<br>they are very clear that they do want to<br>know they do want to be involved at all<br>ages<br>so the next step is for us to become<br>clearer about<br>how to involve children and young people<br>and conversations<br>along the way so that they can<br>eventually have<br>a meaningful say in their own health<br>often when i speak with students and<br>public audiences about<br>this topic of medical intervention<br>in relation to variations of sex<br>characteristics<br>people often express surprise that this<br>kind of<br>normalizing medical intervention still<br>happens<br>even though we and aotearoa are<br>currently going<br>through a united nations review process<br>the issue of<br>elective medical intervention on<br>non-consenting minors<br>is not widely talked about perhaps this<br>issue<br>is thought to be a thing of the past<br>people aren't necessarily aware<br>how we make sense of our experiences can<br>change<br>lives when i was told that<br>for a girl i was good at digging my<br>mother immediately helped me to make<br>sense of this<br>saying that being a girl had nothing to<br>do with it<br>she helped me by reflecting that the<br>comment<br>directed at me was nonsensical<br>we're all involved in making
