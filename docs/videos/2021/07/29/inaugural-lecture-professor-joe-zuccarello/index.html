universities<br>are perfect places to pursue these goals<br>please join me in welcoming professor<br>thank you all for coming um it's nice to<br>uh<br>grant essan wendy thank you for coming<br>um<br>it's nice to be here and uh give this<br>talk on some of the work i've done<br>over many years too many years actually<br>today i was talking to a student<br>and i told them about a paper i wrote<br>and they said they were four years old<br>when i wrote that paper<br>so it's kind of scary um so i'm going to<br>talk about<br>investigations of seaweeds and i'm going<br>to cover a few things one is sort of<br>the things i've done sort of the general<br>things i've done but i also want to<br>highlight<br>how being at a university and having the<br>opportunity<br>we call it academic freedom we call it<br>uh the ability to uh<br>just follow what we like uh is useful<br>and has led to productive insights at<br>least<br>productive for me and then i want to<br>finish about on<br>a topic that's a bit more esoteric<br>and that will is<br>part of ongoing research so this is um<br>the first slide and<br>i guess i'll start by how you get around<br>it's uh it's this right it's it's what<br>are these things right that was my<br>question<br>what are these things in the ocean right<br>this is i didn't do it here i did it in<br>california<br>but i was just very intrigued about<br>stuff that i didn't know anything about<br>and so what are these things can we name<br>them these are all<br>relatively large things that people<br>probably couldn't name<br>just how can you go through life without<br>knowing the things around you<br>and so i was just kind of interested in<br>their natural history sorry about that<br>whenever i take these uh<br>videos on my phone my son always says it<br>looks like i'm trying to film bigfoot<br>obviously i'm not doing it the proper<br>way<br>let's see so i'm going to talk about my<br>biological interests and of course it<br>has to go back to<br>the people who inspired me and taught me<br>and uh<br>there are a few and i'll talk about<br>their work and they've been teachers and<br>you know<br>i'm not sure i fit into that mold but<br>when you think back<br>at the people that influenced you it is<br>those mentors and so<br>my approaches are also based on what my<br>mentors told me<br>and so then i will also talk about some<br>of the things i study that i find<br>interesting<br>and then pick up new research directions<br>because i have this ability to<br>do what i like i hope grant doesn't mind<br>that he has people around that just do<br>what they like<br>so one of the first mentors was a woman<br>called linda gough<br>she was at university of california<br>santa cruz and<br>her approach to science was very<br>question based<br>guessing we call them hypotheses in<br>science but making guesses about things<br>and then trying to think about the<br>organisms you could use<br>to address those questions they're<br>always seaweeds the organisms you could<br>use to address those questions<br>right so it was always questions and so<br>it's very exciting to come up with these<br>guesses<br>and then try and figure out if they were<br>right or wrong which is great<br>the problem with having hypotheses that<br>you are wedded to is<br>you also have to be able to drop them<br>and sometimes that can be difficult<br>this is linda when she's retired she's<br>uh very much involved in<br>carving birds which is a<br>nice thing we all have to think about<br>what we're going to do when we retire<br>my phd i was a guy called john west<br>nothing to do with the tuna company<br>um he was uh very different from linda<br>golf<br>he didn't ask any questions he just his<br>his approach was just look at them just<br>study them<br>don't come up with guesses about how<br>things are done<br>just try and understand what they do see<br>how they reproduce see how they grow<br>find out where they grow and come up<br>with those questions later<br>very different approach this is me<br>with john west as a phd student the<br>woman on the other side is badly reeling<br>she used to work on<br>well she doesn't anymore because they're<br>both retired she used to work on<br>algal cell walls that's john and that's<br>me when i was younger<br>as a phd student and of course with john<br>we've traveled the world<br>collecting algae here we are somewhere<br>in the tropics a little bit later in<br>life<br>and here we are in some beautiful<br>tropical paradise<br>working real hard on university money um<br>this is actually el salvador we were on<br>the pacific coast of el salvador it was<br>very nice<br>with our friend francisco pedoche<br>students have seen this all the time<br>this is my approach to understanding the<br>biological world<br>this is where diversity is in my view of<br>organisms and it has nothing to do with<br>animals<br>somewhere on that tree there are animals<br>in fact i can point them<br>out to people this is where animals are<br>but the diversity is a whole bunch of<br>other things<br>these are eukaryotes we're not even<br>talking about bacteria which<br>one would fill the screen and three more<br>the algae are all over the place<br>and basically their photosynthetic<br>organisms that have particular<br>characteristics i'm going to<br>talk about a few of these i mostly study<br>red algae which is this group called the<br>archiplacida<br>then there's green algae and the large<br>brown algae in the strumenopiles<br>but there's algal groups and other<br>things touched about them<br>in recent research every once in a while<br>so there's three main algal groups the<br>browns the greens and the reds i just<br>came out<br>from a evolution lecture in three two<br>nine so<br>i'm going to lecture to you um<br>nothing like learning something new<br>right um so brain algae are stremeno<br>piles this is a group of eukaryotes<br>that we'll talk about a little bit and<br>two archiplasita which are the reds and<br>greens<br>and the greens of course led to land<br>plants<br>i was trying to think of an art of a<br>typical and<br>charismatic new zealand alga and i guess<br>it would have to be this thing<br>when you get old as i am you start<br>getting grouchy<br>and this is uh probably about the most<br>iconic<br>uh alga of new zealand i can think of<br>and this is what i get grouchy about<br>it was the only seaweed on a dollar on a<br>monetary note and you can see at the top<br>we have a penguin<br>and birds and a penguin and some plants<br>and some dervillia right here<br>and they re-did it and they kept the<br>bird they kept their other one plant<br>they kept the other plant they got rid<br>of the algae<br>this is kind of the position<br>that phycologists have to be in they<br>obviously didn't<br>consult me this is just some<br>work looking at diversity so this is a<br>alga<br>that's very common in new zealand called<br>lasonia it was thought to be one species<br>in all over the country<br>sonalgona makes alginate it's got a<br>possibility of being grown<br>for uh for alginate which is a cell wall<br>product that can be used commercially<br>this is what it looks like it turns out<br>that if you look at it genetically there<br>are four species in new zealand that<br>have very<br>distinct distributions so there's one<br>that<br>goes up to east cape there's one that's<br>found in kaikoura<br>genetic diversity multiple species if<br>you want to<br>harvest these if you want to exploit<br>them<br>you have to take this into consideration<br>then there's another brown alga<br>that film they all have they don't<br>really have uh<br>common names uh this is called rack<br>there's so many things called rack it<br>doesn't make any sense<br>so this is what it looks like it also<br>got floating devices and you can look at<br>the genetic diversity<br>so just the colors when there's more<br>color different colors they're<br>genetically different<br>and you can see that in the south and<br>the east coast<br>there's less genetic diversity and<br>there's reasons for this it has to do<br>with<br>climate change and there's changes in<br>sea water temperatures<br>and these things have been moving down<br>as the water has been cooling<br>as the water's been warming sorry but<br>different genetic diversity<br>this is a red alga these are the sort of<br>studies i do very often is just trying<br>to understand the genetic diversity<br>and these organisms and trying to get<br>some idea of<br>what we have in new zealand and how they<br>live so here is analga just look at the<br>colors<br>there's some purple species here they<br>all look the same<br>genetic types and then there's a purple<br>one and in some places there are<br>multiple living together and the<br>question is when<br>organisms live together what do they do<br>do they segregate<br>the environment and it turns out in this<br>organism it does<br>so this is um a alga that grows<br>in the intertidal it's called apostrokia<br>intracta<br>in one genotype so the purple gene<br>the orange genotype grows much lower<br>than the other genotype<br>so genetic diversity is not just a<br>measure of some random thing<br>it's a measure that reflects some<br>ecological characteristic<br>its production its productivity its<br>reproduction<br>and also how it segregates in the<br>environment so that's<br>uh that's one of the reasons that we try<br>and study these things<br>i also had the opportunity to work with<br>a colleague that couldn't come here<br>his car broke down on the way he lives<br>in raumati now<br>and to work on a green algae i don't<br>usually work on green algae<br>that grows in lake baikal but like<br>baikal is in siberia here it is<br>it's the largest freshwater body of<br>water in the ocean is the deepest<br>largest oldest and coldest now maybe not<br>coldest<br>it's got all the epitaphs oldest deepest<br>something very oligotrophic very special<br>body of water in east germany and east<br>in siberia and it has a unique flora<br>of green algae that have been studied<br>by russian by soviet uh scientists and<br>that we<br>wanted to look at also and look at them<br>genetically<br>uh because they've been described as<br>indi different uh genera from what<br>we studied before and they're quite<br>diverse<br>this doesn't seem like a lot of<br>diversity but for this group of<br>organisms there's a lot of diversity<br>so it's branched organisms crustos<br>organisms one's a branch more one's at<br>branchless<br>this is much diversity as you see within<br>this whole order of these green algae<br>and it's a very unique environment these<br>are sponge<br>green algal symbioses in this ocean it's<br>a very unique<br>very oligotrophic ocean of water it has<br>a<br>landlocked seal thousands of miles from<br>the ocean that got stuck there<br>all kinds of interesting organisms but<br>also these things<br>but when we looked at them instead of<br>being different genera it turned out<br>that they were all<br>very closely genetically related to each<br>other and they're all nested<br>within a group of organisms that doesn't<br>looks very similar they're all<br>unbranched filaments so this<br>morphological diversity seems to have<br>originated<br>in lake baikal and uh christian and i<br>applied for a marsden we got some money<br>to continue this work so they look<br>different<br>are they different species or is it just<br>genetic variation within a species<br>you know the resolution of the markers<br>we used at the beginning were very low<br>and so christian and this phd student<br>continued on this<br>and showed that these species these many<br>of these morphological types are<br>actually genetic species<br>and this is called sympatric speciation<br>which is very rare<br>in biology at least rare to show in<br>biology<br>organisms that live in the same place<br>that speciate and certainly not known<br>analogy<br>so here's um just this these are the<br>individuals around these little rows and<br>the color<br>puts them based on genetic data into one<br>species or another so here you can see a<br>morphology<br>that all fits together and here's a<br>morphology that mostly fits together and<br>some<br>don't quite match the morphology doesn't<br>quite match the genetics<br>so that means that there's some sort of<br>reproductive compatibility between these<br>individuals<br>this is rhizoctium these bicone<br>samples and then of course there's this<br>right there's the continued<br>and something that i spend quite a bit<br>of time with some of my colleagues<br>especially aniwa there are things that<br>look different<br>they're all the same and they're of<br>course things that are the same<br>that are different and so just to<br>untangle that<br>again if we don't know what they are if<br>we can't give them a name then how can<br>we understand their distribution how can<br>we understand the chemistry that they<br>have how can we understand<br>how they'll grow and be impacted by the<br>environment these are all the same thing<br>i would never have guessed it right<br>genetically they're identical right<br>again this is a<br>ongoing we're very lucky in new zealand<br>for hat<br>lucky maybe is the wrong word we have<br>lots and lots of species that have not<br>been described in new zealand and we<br>still don't understand the diversity<br>that exists in new zealand<br>okay i want to kind of change a little<br>bit<br>and talk about chance serendipity and<br>this is uh sort of<br>backing up this idea that i had of<br>of the ability you have as a academic<br>to just follow things that you're<br>interested in<br>having students having small parts of<br>money<br>paid for by the universe given by the<br>university to do<br>research of whatever interests you right<br>and so it's called serendipity<br>so my first serendipity is in one of my<br>classes we do a dna extraction<br>and and we sequence<br>sequence seaweed and we try and teach<br>the students<br>both lab techniques but also how to<br>understand diversity based on dna<br>sequences<br>and so we do a dna extraction and when<br>we do a dna extraction you expect a<br>heavy<br>high molecular weight band this is the<br>chromosomal big band of dna<br>and all the students do that and they<br>all run the gel they're all happy<br>because they run inaugural gels and put<br>blue juice into<br>agarose gels but this one had a band it<br>actually had two bands it had a band<br>there<br>and this is from red alga called<br>champion overzealandia<br>and you know it's like yeah you know<br>there are 60 students lots of labs it's<br>like yeah<br>i looked at it and i said that's<br>interesting i wonder what that is<br>to honor students later we've kind of<br>figured out what it was<br>for a long time i thought it was a<br>plasmid so red algae are known to have<br>plasmids these are circular<br>extra chromosomal dna that exists in<br>the organisms this is a dna extraction a<br>lab dna extraction<br>that uses rnase so i thought okay it<br>can't be rna<br>but if we so this is the same different<br>gel here's a ladder<br>this is the dna the high molecular<br>weight dna here's that band<br>that i was talking to if you add a dna<br>it's an enzyme that eats dna<br>it actually removes that but not this<br>after a long process we learned that it<br>was a double-stranded<br>rna virus and it's actually so we<br>sequenced it it's made up of two genes<br>and it's a total virus which are known<br>in some red algae<br>but the most intriguing thing is when<br>you run this virus<br>in a dna extraction you have a band<br>and then you have a band you can see<br>it turns out that this total virus makes<br>up about 30 percent of the<br>double-stranded nucleic acid in this<br>organism<br>i mean i don't know where that could<br>possibly happen in the world right it<br>just<br>is mind-boggling what is it doing right<br>to<br>copy itself to 30 percent of the nucleic<br>acid that exists in the organism<br>right how does it affect that organism<br>so this is individual<br>individual plants the percentage of<br>double-stranded rna within those<br>individual plants<br>a large amount uh i'm not sure i will<br>continue with this<br>those questions may be very difficult to<br>is is intriguing right and it all led<br>from just me paying attention to when<br>students ran these gels<br>extracting from random algae in new<br>zealand right<br>you know a little bit of money to do<br>that<br>a while ago i had a friend who worked<br>for a company a chemical company<br>a degussa which does all kinds of<br>chemistry including carbohydrate<br>chemistry<br>and red algae this is another red algal<br>red algae or<br>even though it looks green red algae<br>have products<br>carrageenan in this case which is used<br>for rough<br>industry for all kinds of things<br>additives to food<br>grown in the tropics like crazy this<br>person had all these dried samples i had<br>some dna mark some<br>markers that would tell variation within<br>species and he said could i send these<br>to you to sequence i'm like sure i'd be<br>fine it wouldn't cost that much so he<br>sent me you know 200 samples<br>spent a bit of time sequencing them you<br>know are these<br>the same species right they all look<br>different here's these farms<br>gigantic farms this is in indonesia but<br>in malaysia and the philippines<br>and now all over the world it's been<br>sequenced<br>because you can put it into food right<br>here it is carrageenan<br>if you have anything slimy fast food<br>frozen dinners they'll have carrageenan<br>and toothpaste will have carrigane in it<br>it's just slime from a so from a red<br>alga but it's a<br>it's a it's a big business and it's you<br>know there's<br>also the social benefits of farmers who<br>are fishing to actually grow these<br>things<br>and so i ended up sequencing these some<br>of them were wild some of them were<br>cultivated all the cultivated ones were<br>practically identical<br>so they're identical with the mark as i<br>had this is what this line up and down<br>means here's another<br>eukuma dentindiculatum also identical<br>it looks like in farms all over the<br>world<br>including the americas there identically<br>genetically<br>which makes sense you just break a piece<br>off you actually put it in your pocket<br>get on the plane take it to some place<br>and put it in the ocean and grow it<br>again<br>right so there's no genetic variation<br>and this is starting to cause a problem<br>with no genetic variation<br>in monoculture you're starting to have a<br>problem of diseases<br>right and we have to<br>learn to increase the genetic diversity<br>before we do that we didn't know that<br>there was no genetic diversity we could<br>have guessed it<br>we didn't know it not only that<br>these things in farms are all identical<br>so in this is in africa so this is<br>this is tanzania this is zanzibar and<br>pemba two islands off of tanzania<br>in farms they're all the genotype that<br>is used for farms<br>in outside farms in coral reefs<br>in seagrass beds the african genotypes<br>are disappearing<br>because these plants are breaking off in<br>from farms<br>and spreading to outside the reef and<br>out competing just because of numbers<br>how competing<br>the genotypes that you would like to<br>keep if you want to produce plants that<br>will have<br>higher genetic variation<br>to protect them against diseases for<br>example<br>so this was continued work with some<br>people from sweden after i'd written the<br>first paper<br>and of course this led to a bunch of<br>work<br>in indonesia i've gone to three i've<br>taught three workshops in indonesia<br>they really care about these things<br>because they have carrageenan<br>teach people how to do basic molecular<br>biology<br>genotyping these samples to try and<br>understand<br>the genetic variation and what species<br>they're growing mostly farmers don't<br>even know right they just grows well<br>so here's this me in one of the<br>workshops i was going to go to one just<br>before covet hit<br>i missed one out and here's me talking<br>to somebody who knows what the heck i'm<br>saying<br>but here i am eating indonesian food<br>here's another kind of serendipitous<br>story so i've been working with<br>some people in asia in korea on<br>something i'll talk about at the end<br>which is a bit of genetic variation<br>this is me at a perfera farm a pyropia<br>farm so this is a nori farm<br>or kim as it's called in korea farm<br>they grow it in korea this is it this is<br>stuff that gets wrapped around your<br>sushi<br>it's a big business in korea it's more<br>profitable than all the other<br>aquaculture combined<br>again have problems with diseases<br>this is a picture of round wando from an<br>island all these stripes<br>are those nets and this is just a small<br>part<br>of these maps big business<br>there's always ideas of trying to bring<br>something like this to new zealand<br>we have lots of these related species to<br>these ones that are cultivated in korea<br>in new zealand this is just me and my<br>colleagues<br>you have to go in winter they don't grow<br>in summer and of course it has diseases<br>and one of the diseases is called red<br>spot<br>and so this is the red spot disease it<br>kills them<br>they don't look nice the price goes down<br>the plant falls apart<br>and so my question was i was there for<br>other reasons i thought well i wonder if<br>they have it in new zealand we have lots<br>of these algae in new zealand and<br>related things<br>so this is actually red spot this is<br>what it causes just kills them it turns<br>out it's a stramina pile<br>it's an oh my seat and i had a student<br>look at it in new zealand collected from<br>different plants<br>it exists you can isolate it you can<br>grow it in dishes<br>so oh my seats all my seats used to be<br>called lower fungi i never understood<br>what that meant<br>used to be called pseudo fungi i don't<br>understand what that meant they're not<br>even<br>either they're just stromenopiles but<br>they cause diseases<br>same group of organisms causes kaori<br>dieback and<br>i talk through disease and potatoes and<br>things<br>and of course it's the same so in new<br>zealand<br>we have this genotype that's the same as<br>the ones<br>that are causing diseases in in korea<br>and of course this is something we have<br>to think about right if we want to have<br>an<br>industry of pyropia it turns out this<br>thing will infect<br>other pyropia plants if we want to have<br>an industry we have to take into<br>consideration<br>the pathogen is already here how is that<br>going to affect things what are we going<br>to do<br>about that okay<br>all science all fields of science have a<br>bit of esoterica<br>esoterica in novels is always<br>interesting<br>we have esoterica in science<br>kind of how it progresses we just talk<br>to each other about things that are<br>important to<br>advance the field that may not be<br>interesting to other people<br>and i'm going to talk a little bit about<br>esoterica and how it led to an<br>understanding of something that i think<br>is more important<br>so again teaching you red algae transfer<br>nuclei between cells<br>not from the same division it's called<br>secondary connection formation and it<br>produces beautiful pattern where you<br>have cells<br>that have one nucleus and cells that<br>have two<br>it's a normal process that red algae<br>have<br>but also after fertilization they<br>transfer nuclei<br>so this is a an egg this is the<br>extension of the egg<br>and these are three sperm attached to<br>the egg they fertilize that egg<br>makes a diploid nucleus and that diploid<br>nucleus goes somewhere<br>it often goes to a nearby cell it's got<br>special names like<br>all reproduction has<br>crazy names it goes to another cell and<br>then causes that cell<br>that used to be haploid that has this<br>new nucleus to act differently<br>it grows into a zygote with multiple<br>cells that goes into a diploid this<br>parasite is<br>on the female and this work has been<br>going on for a very long time you can<br>always tell that is because it's always<br>it's written in german that's how old<br>it's been but again<br>these nuclei get transferred very odd<br>and this is just some work i did with my<br>korean colleagues trying to understand<br>how the auxiliary cell the specialized<br>cell<br>gets ready to accept that nucleus so<br>here we have a picture of a<br>egg with a sperm attached here's the<br>this is a reactive oxygen species<br>very interesting so these products which<br>are really<br>poisons that are produced by<br>chloroplasts and mitochondria are<br>actually now used<br>as a signaling molecule so here's the<br>molecules the egg the sperm is<br>fertilized<br>once the sperm and the sperm and the egg<br>fuse<br>the body of the egg becomes labeled<br>with these reactive oxygen species and<br>the cells that maintain that that hold<br>that<br>egg also get labeled and here you can<br>see it<br>the egg gets fertilized and these cells<br>get labeled<br>why are they doing that well again it's<br>this<br>thing in this organism the<br>the signal seems to go down this<br>these cells and activates cell division<br>to prepare<br>esoterica it gets weirder than that<br>these cells can these diploid cells can<br>transfer that<br>nucleus to another diploid cell that can<br>grow into a<br>multiple deployed parasitizing the<br>female<br>and be transferred to another cell and<br>they just pass on this nucleus<br>and they'd grow into a diploid on the<br>female and just release<br>these things very odd it's the thing<br>that red algae do<br>nobody else does and of course<br>esoterica you have to interpret these<br>kind of things<br>i wouldn't try i can almost understand<br>it<br>roberto is here she's the only one that<br>can actually do this<br>work but you can see just what i said so<br>here's a cell<br>that has received a diploid nucleus<br>through this cell<br>here these cells transferring these<br>diploid nuclei<br>to a special cell that then grows and<br>continues growing<br>and releases these diploid nuclei so<br>basically from one fertilization you get<br>millions<br>of diploid zygotes released it's a very<br>unique characteristic of red algae why<br>is that interesting<br>is because this process has been kind of<br>hijacked somehow<br>by parasites so hijacked so there are<br>red algae that are parasites on other<br>red algae<br>and they've hijacked this ability to<br>transfer nuclei<br>to a cell that they're not related to<br>and get it to act<br>like one of them this is just some<br>pictures of those<br>some very nice ones there's lots of them<br>in new zealand it turns out that these<br>parasites so these are parasites in blue<br>and the and the host in red the<br>parasites are more closely related to<br>their host than the host is to other<br>these parasites came out of the host<br>that they growing on<br>right sometimes they're not so closely<br>related so they're in the same genus but<br>they're slightly more distally related<br>and what they do is just what it sounds<br>like they transfer a nucleus so this is<br>the parasite in red<br>transfers a nucleus into a host cell<br>in this case the host cell just grows<br>and acts as a sink for nutrients here's<br>some pictures of that<br>here the host nuclei and here's the<br>transferred parasite nucleus<br>transfer the nucleus into a non-related<br>cell<br>and gets it to do something for itself<br>and of course that continues there's<br>some parasites<br>that will transfer that nucleus and that<br>diploid cell starts<br>the nuclei of the parasites are growing<br>they continue growing they infect<br>other host cells it produces a parasite<br>these parasites don't really affect the<br>host<br>there are about 120 independent<br>evolutions of these parasites<br>they seem to have hijacked this<br>machinery of passing nuclei around<br>and controlling somebody who's not you<br>right using their nuclei to control<br>things how they came about<br>what the effects of all this is are just<br>interesting questions for phycologists<br>here's just more pictures that here's a<br>parasite<br>fused to this host cell this is the host<br>nucleus and these are the parasite<br>nuclei<br>in the host in the cell and it<br>transforms them so here's a parasite<br>transform<br>passing it on to a host this host has<br>chloroplasts these yellow things but<br>they're starting to be degraded<br>by turning this parasite this host cell<br>into a parasite cell<br>so what's the what's the outcome of all<br>that right what happens to these<br>organelles that get transferred into the<br>nucleus they got<br>nuclei what happens to the host nuclei<br>what happens to the host mitochondrion<br>chloroplast the same for the parasite<br>what gets transmitted to the next<br>generation does everything get<br>transmitted to the next generation<br>and of course how did it all come about<br>right we've got this idea<br>from this esoteric understanding of<br>parasites of red algae transferring<br>nuclear between unrelated cells but<br>somehow<br>it got co-opted into this process and<br>how it came about<br>question of keep me alive keep me uh<br>thinking about it for a while<br>so new zealand has lots of parasites new<br>discoveries all the time<br>there's lots of questions about what<br>species we have in new zealand<br>what variation we have in new zealand<br>what evolutionary transitions we have<br>between different species what<br>physiological capacity capacities we<br>have about this<br>underlying genetic variation that we<br>can't see from from just morphology<br>and also it's just important to be able<br>to have the opportunity not only<br>mentally open<br>and just observing things without<br>thinking about the consequences<br>yeah i am apparently told that i always<br>do things without thinking about the<br>consequences<br>my wife keeps telling me this but also<br>the freedom<br>to pursue these things right and so<br>universities do<br>provide this ability right i'm here to<br>teach students i'm here to train<br>other scientists but i also have the<br>ability<br>to just follow my interests right to<br>advance<br>the field i<br>you know without thinking about where it<br>might go<br>right just because it's interesting and<br>it's advancing<br>my research field this is a<br>famous this is a saying by uh theodore<br>bavaria virgil very is a very famous<br>biologist german<br>you can never misquote people<br>or take quotes out of context the first<br>half of this quote is actually very good<br>bavaria discovered the<br>nuclei controlled development he also<br>was the first to try and make the<br>connection between chromosomal<br>abnormality<br>abnormality and cancer<br>he also was a very strong advocate of<br>marine stations and spent every summer<br>why would you spend it in germany we can<br>go to naples to anton d'or marine<br>station<br>and so he had a very strong connection<br>with<br>the marine stations in naples equally<br>strong is a contrast between the<br>marvelous freedom of research<br>which is the good part of that and then<br>the other part never end on a good note<br>and you can't leave take it out of con<br>but one finds interest<br>research one finds interesting and the<br>sufficiently exercised task to press<br>zoology i could say phycology into heads<br>that do not want to know anything at all<br>about it<br>uh yeah i didn't want to take it out of<br>context so i'll give you the whole thing<br>this is a letter he wrote to anton door<br>wonderful thank you thank you very much<br>tanaka<br>my name is essan mespahi and i'm the pro<br>vice chancellor<br>of the wellington faculties of science<br>health engineering architecture and<br>design innovation also known as<br>shady and it's my great pleasure to give<br>the vote of thanks to<br>professor jose carello for tonight's<br>lecture<br>i have to do a little bit of this script<br>if i may because joe is a marine<br>biologist and i'm a marine engineer<br>so i started working on algae because i<br>wanted to kill them<br>because algae and different type of<br>phytoplankton get on board ships<br>and go around around the world and<br>they call them introduction of<br>non-indigenous species<br>and they cause a lot of problems because<br>sometimes they produce toxic<br>toxic alcohol blooms so my job was to<br>find the best way to eradicate and kill<br>them<br>and i had a research group about 12 phd<br>students and one of them<br>during the process of finding how you<br>can kill<br>algae and phytoplankton and seaweeds he<br>found<br>the ways that you can grow them you know<br>sometimes when you want to kill<br>something you understand how they live<br>and so so he started calling himself dr<br>seaweed and he started a company in uk<br>dr seaweed um i didn't know we have<br>professor seaweed here<br>so but probably i don't want to put<br>anything into your mind<br>uh but maybe you can do something<br>business-like<br>no no what he does he produces seaweed<br>for nutritional<br>and medicinal purposes and he puts them<br>in little capsules and sells them quite<br>quite expensively but<br>anyway so tonight we had<br>the the pleasure of having a very small<br>glimpse of<br>your fantastic enthusiasm for biology<br>and<br>in particular marine biology and and<br>they<br>feel the known in the very very<br>uh reputable field of research with<br>alcohol<br>diversity and this is something which i<br>personally totally enjoyed<br>all these alongside your strong<br>commitment to teaching<br>means you have made them continue to<br>make invaluable contribution to the<br>school of biological sciences<br>and the wider university community<br>and as wesh chancellor mentioned your<br>contribution goes beyond<br>your research at tehrangawaka one of our<br>primary purposes is to provide<br>excellent education to other students<br>and to prepare them<br>for an extraordinary life and this is<br>something joe that you do<br>you are an enthusiastic teacher and we<br>could probably<br>see it quite clearly in the way you<br>presented tonight<br>and you're always improving your own<br>skills you are inspiring our students<br>and um and it's not only looking into<br>teaching biological information but i<br>think you also<br>introduce critical thinking and this is<br>something which you<br>probably repeatedly mentioned the<br>freedom<br>of what you get at university and that<br>critical thinking without freedom<br>is not helpful and and so i can i can<br>see that how<br>it has helped you and your students to<br>flourish<br>uh at university i have to note here<br>that um his wife patricia<br>i don't know where she is she must be<br>somewhere hi patricia<br>patricia is one of our senior student<br>advisors in faculty of science<br>and i think joe admits that patricia<br>does<br>a lot more contribution to university<br>that you do<br>behind every successful professor is a<br>very strong partner<br>and i think i have to probably thank you<br>more than i'm thanking you<br>for making sure that you're doing a<br>fantastic job<br>and uh with her support and and the<br>fantastic job that patricia does for the<br>faculty and the division<br>your lecture tonight also highlighted<br>the important role that<br>universities in general play in society<br>um our environment provides a staff with<br>the freedom to explore a wide range of<br>questions<br>in the unencumbered pursuit of knowledge<br>while one of our primary goals is<br>teaching<br>the teaching that inspires and prepares<br>the students<br>best is led by researchers who can feed<br>their world-class research into their<br>classrooms and i think this<br>is what you do brilliantly and job<br>as a pro vice chancellor i'm very proud<br>to have you as one of my professors<br>you have been around for 17 years here<br>and i hope that we can have you another<br>17 years<br>at university by the way i've been here<br>in 17 months<br>so i think i have a long way to go and<br>for this wonderful<br>fantastic inaugural lecture and without<br>further ado i would like to invite all<br>of you<br>to not only join me in thanking joe<br>again for his fantastic lecture<br>but also there are some refreshments<br>outside and then let us<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
