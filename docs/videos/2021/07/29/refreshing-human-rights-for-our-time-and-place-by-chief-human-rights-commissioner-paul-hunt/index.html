very<br>much indeed and the university<br>as the vice chancellor intimated the<br>university played<br>a really important role in my life and<br>the life of my father<br>as some of you will know joe<br>taught in religious studies here on on<br>campus<br>and our son robbie was born here in<br>kirikiri roa<br>he and our daughter emily schooled in<br>hillcrest<br>and coming back here memories flood in<br>i i remember walking through campus with<br>emily who was then a little girl and she<br>urged me<br>to skip with her<br>hand in hand from one side of campus to<br>the other<br>and we did and it was quite<br>a sight on another occasion<br>robbie a little boy at that stage was at<br>home<br>and he was playing with a friend and i<br>returned to the house i returned with a<br>suitcase<br>i'd been traveling overseas and<br>he warmly greeted me and<br>his playmate that he was with said<br>what does your dad do and rob replied<br>he travels around the world doing good<br>and then there was a long sigh<br>you see i kept having to go back right<br>so obviously i failed to fix it<br>the first time well i can't be<br>sure it'll work this afternoon either<br>but what i'd like to do<br>is to make a few remarks<br>human rights in aotearoa have made<br>a major contribution to our<br>society but in my humble opinion<br>they need urgently refreshing<br>for our time and place in our turbo<br>human rights are mainly associated with<br>combating discrimination<br>and this struggle is of huge importance<br>and in the human rights commission most<br>of our work<br>is devoted to fighting discrimination<br>but human rights are not only<br>about discrimination they also include<br>a range of other human rights including<br>for instance<br>the right to a decent home successive<br>new zealand governments have legally<br>agreed to implement these other human<br>rights<br>but they have failed to adequately do so<br>worse than that some of these human<br>rights are almost<br>unknown and invisible in anteroa<br>agreeing things in new york and burying<br>them<br>in wellington is disgraceful<br>and it undermines trust and confidence<br>in government human rights now toro have<br>other elemental problems too<br>they need refreshing because human<br>rights talk<br>has become excessively legalistic and<br>often divorced from everyday lives<br>also most people think that human rights<br>only place responsibilities on<br>government<br>whereas human rights place<br>responsibilities on governments<br>on business and indeed on individuals<br>further in relation to human rights we<br>have yet to strike<br>a healthy balance between i and we<br>that is between individual and community<br>last year two pillars of the british<br>establishment<br>support collier and sir john k published<br>a slim<br>volume called greed is dead<br>politics after individualism<br>the authors are leading economists and<br>after reading the book<br>i was left wondering what they've been<br>doing for the last 40 years<br>but nonetheless the book makes important<br>points<br>and it it talks<br>about what has been called and i quote<br>destructive individualism<br>community community is vital to human<br>beings<br>because community brings us a sense of<br>belonging<br>the norwegian prime minister anna<br>solberg who has been forced to confront<br>violent white supremacists<br>recently observed you don't attack<br>what you feel that you belong to<br>so how can we refresh human rights for<br>our time<br>and for our place here in<br>in aotearoa i think that we have to<br>begin by reflecting on values<br>values and human rights prime minister<br>ardern often talks about values<br>when she addressed the united nations in<br>the shadow<br>of the 15th of march 2019 she affirmed<br>the universal declaration for human<br>rights<br>and she said this she said what if we no<br>longer see ourselves<br>based on what we look like what religion<br>we practice or where we live<br>but by what we value humanity she said<br>kindness an innate sense of our<br>connection to each other<br>and a belief that we are guardians not<br>just of our home<br>and our planet but of each but of each<br>other<br>last week at the government's extremely<br>turbulent hui<br>on countering terrorism and violent<br>extremism<br>she emphasized we are seeking guidance<br>and ideas on strengthening our<br>counterterrorism strategy in a uniquely<br>new zealand way<br>and then she said recognizing our treaty<br>relationship<br>our diversity and our values<br>and the prime minister is absolutely<br>right to emphasize the critical<br>importance of<br>values values are the glue<br>that holds a society together values<br>inform human rights and crucially<br>human rights embody values<br>human rights are designed to ensure that<br>our values are not<br>inadvertently overlooked or deliberately<br>sacrificed on the altar of political<br>expediency<br>human rights help to ensure that<br>confronted by a national crisis<br>by a global pandemic or other emergency<br>human rights are a check on what alex<br>the tockville called<br>the tyranny of the majority a human<br>rights it seems to me are not only a<br>check on the tyranny of the majority<br>they're also a check on the tyranny of<br>the powerful<br>at root human rights provide a check on<br>the abuse<br>of public power their primary<br>purpose the primary purpose of human<br>rights is to protect<br>our values<br>but which values if values inform human<br>rights<br>and human rights and body values which<br>are among the values<br>mari is underpinned by a whakapapa<br>and by kinship<br>in this world view relationships between<br>people past present and future are of<br>central importance<br>also the relationship between people and<br>the natural world<br>is crucial kaitiakitanga<br>stewardship a system of reciprocal<br>rights and responsibilities<br>arises from these relationships it<br>includes<br>intergenerational responsibilities and<br>it also has<br>spiritual dimensions mana requires the<br>maintenance of these relationships and<br>responsibilities<br>reflects an indivisible relationship<br>it includes an abiding sense of love<br>for papa to which targeted<br>belong in our<br>in altera our values encompass<br>to our mari and the world views<br>of other communities<br>these values not only include those that<br>i've already mentioned<br>they also include menarche dignity<br>fairness decency equality<br>freedom well-being<br>safety autonomy<br>participation partnership<br>community and responsibility<br>these are the values that provide the<br>bedrock<br>of society in hunter rome<br>and these are the values that are<br>embodied in human rights<br>and if human rights become estranged<br>from these<br>values human rights lose their<br>legitimacy<br>their authority their currency<br>values however values like culture<br>are not set in stone values evolve as<br>generations come and go<br>because values evolve so must human<br>rights<br>but without compromising the essence of<br>human rights<br>what is this essence of human rights and<br>here<br>i cannot do the question justice but i<br>provide two<br>laughably superficial responses<br>first the essence of human rights<br>coalesces around kaitiakitanga<br>manakitanga dignity well-being<br>and the fair treatment of individuals<br>and communities<br>the second response is this the essence<br>of human rights is encapsulated<br>in what's known as the golden rule the<br>golden rule which<br>arguably is found in all major world<br>religions<br>and informs all major cultural ethical<br>systems<br>the golden rule has a negative and a<br>positive form<br>the positive form is this do to others<br>what you would have then do to you<br>it seems to me the golden rule might<br>have an important role to play as we<br>journey<br>towards a multicultural society based on<br>teteriti or waitangi but my main point<br>is this<br>human rights are inalienable that is<br>they belong to everyone by virtue of<br>their humanity<br>and they cannot be expunged but<br>human rights are not unchanging<br>human rights have to be dynamic<br>as un secretary general bucharest<br>mitrosgali put it in his opening address<br>to the world conference on human rights<br>in vienna in 1993<br>he said human rights are in constant<br>movement<br>if human rights become static if they<br>become<br>relics from the past they<br>hinder progress in aotearoa the dynamism<br>of human rights<br>enables them to play a constructive role<br>as we confront<br>our colonial past and build a<br>multicultural society<br>based on tateritiuetangi in which<br>everyone everyone can meaningfully<br>last year conscious of the values<br>new zealanders esteemed<br>i try to reframe human rights<br>as the three r's<br>relationships responsibilities<br>and rights first of all<br>briefly relationships at the heart of<br>human rights<br>and at the heart of taituriti are<br>respectful<br>relationships between individuals and<br>communities<br>i often hear inspiring stories about our<br>rich multiculturalism grounded in<br>tataridi<br>but i also hear about communities<br>talking past each other<br>and we really do need to give more<br>attention to thoughtful<br>relationship building between<br>communities<br>that's the first star relationships the<br>second<br>responsibilities although<br>the provision is often overlooked the<br>universal declaration of human rights<br>confirms that individuals have and i<br>quote<br>duties to the community of course<br>responsibilities are integral to<br>tateviti<br>the response to kovic 19 which we're<br>experiencing today<br>at least we are in wellington the<br>response to kovic 19<br>such as social distancing and<br>self-isolation shows that most of us<br>understand we have responsibilities to<br>our communities<br>we've exhibited that in the last 18<br>months or so<br>most of us also grasp that we have a<br>responsibility not to discriminate<br>on any of the prohibited crowns such as<br>disability<br>gender and sexual orientation<br>most of us accept we have some sort of<br>responsibility<br>to safeguard our environment<br>we need to be much clearer that human<br>rights not only grant entitlements but<br>also place<br>responsibilities on all of us<br>nonetheless i acknowledge we must be<br>very careful<br>about the idea of placing human rights<br>responsibilities<br>on individuals if a society is plagued<br>by systemic disadvantage as<br>ours is and we then place<br>responsibilities on disadvantaged<br>individuals and communities<br>this runs the risk of reinforcing<br>their disadvantage i have to say<br>in the united nations i always avoided<br>deliberately avoided saying<br>individuals have human rights<br>responsibilities because i knew this<br>argument<br>would be misused by authoritarian<br>regimes<br>by feudal regimes<br>here in aotearoa for a bunch of reasons<br>that i won't go<br>into i think it is appropriate to talk<br>about<br>individuals human rights<br>responsibilities<br>but i accept the argument needs careful<br>attention<br>to ensure that it does not accidentally<br>do more harm than good so the three r's<br>relationships responsibilities and then<br>the third one is riots<br>and as we've seen human rights are about<br>fairness<br>they're about men archetyping human<br>rights dignify<br>individuals human rights empower<br>communities<br>in the united nations successive new<br>zealand governments have promised to<br>advance civil rights<br>political rights workers rights<br>social rights cultural rights the right<br>to a safe environment<br>and indigenous people's rights<br>this broad understanding of human rights<br>reflects<br>what humans value this broad<br>understanding<br>also chimes with teteriti<br>just a few months ago just a few months<br>ago i<br>i wrote an op-ed in which i in which i<br>argued that we had to think in terms of<br>the three eyes<br>it was just an editorial opinion piece<br>editorial page opinion piece in the<br>dominion post<br>in which i talked about as i talked this<br>afternoon about the importance of seeing<br>human rights as<br>a question of responsibilities and<br>relationships and indeed rights<br>and to my delight a cartoonist in the<br>dominion post picked up<br>my op-ed and did this cartoon<br>she made one correction um i really<br>liked the cartoon but she did make one<br>correction and i<br>i had talked about the garden of human<br>rights and tetoriti<br>and actually territory has slipped off<br>but<br>there you have it in the garden of human<br>rights relationships building<br>relationships between individuals and<br>between communities and understanding<br>their often comes acceptance<br>and then the middle the little panel we<br>each have responsibilities to each other<br>like when we maintain physical distance<br>if we are sick or pay our fair share<br>toward<br>maintaining our society and environment<br>and then there is the rights component<br>civil political workers social culture<br>rights the right to safe environment<br>each and every one of us deserves the<br>right to<br>thrive so i was very grateful<br>i was very grateful to the cartoonist<br>for<br>capturing um rather in a rather<br>elegant way um what i was trying to<br>write<br>in my short article in the dominion post<br>i have to i have to say that i was<br>talking about the three r's<br>responsibilities relationships and<br>rights at another meeting<br>and afterwards someone who i greatly<br>respect someone came up to me and said<br>paul i completely get it while you're<br>talking about relationships<br>and i completely get it while you're<br>talking about responsibilities<br>but why are you talking about riots<br>so given my accent i hadn't been<br>sufficiently clear<br>and she thought i was advocating the<br>three hours of relationships<br>responsibilities and riots<br>you can imagine the headline<br>commissioner for human rights urges<br>public to riot<br>so it's not riots it's rights and it<br>seems to me<br>that if we are to understand<br>the three eyes and implement them then<br>these human rights<br>have to be brought home they have to be<br>brought<br>home they have to be situated<br>and implemented within our unique<br>historical context demographic context<br>within our unique environment<br>environmental and legal context<br>including tateriti of waitangi<br>that it seems to me is one of the great<br>challenges confronting us<br>is how to bring human rights home<br>so that they are relevant and meaningful<br>in our<br>distinctive unique context<br>it seems to me that there are signs<br>it's going to be very challenging to do<br>what i've just said to bring these human<br>rights<br>home i think it's going to be very<br>challenging i've often been told by<br>diplomats some of them<br>representatives of misogynistic<br>authoritarian racist homophobic states<br>i've often been told by diplomats<br>don't worry our laws and policies may<br>not<br>explicitly mention human rights but<br>don't worry about it<br>they those human rights implicitly shape<br>more surprising i've heard the same<br>argument<br>from diplomats of liberal democratic<br>states<br>and i have to tell you that since my<br>appointment to the human rights<br>commission<br>i've heard vision versions i've heard<br>versions of this argument<br>on lambton key and the beehive<br>in fact one version of that argument<br>just in the last couple of days<br>now this argument we don't have to worry<br>because officials<br>will ensure the human rights are<br>implicitly<br>honored this argument is patronizing<br>it's self-serving and<br>it masks human rights<br>it drains power away from individuals<br>and communities<br>to those in authority<br>it means only those in authority know<br>whether and when human rights are being<br>taken into account<br>and if they are how they're being<br>interpreted<br>and how they're being applied and such<br>arbitrariness is deeply objectionable<br>explicitly not implicitly explicitly<br>framing something as a human rights<br>as a human right matters without the<br>status of a human right<br>it is shorn of its trans transformative<br>promise<br>its emancipatory promise and its<br>relational<br>promise but how<br>how can we make explicit human rights<br>more operational<br>more relevant to the everyday lives of<br>everybody<br>in 2005 the u.n secretary general kofi<br>annan made a speech on human rights<br>a really important speech in which he<br>emphasized<br>that and he said the era of declaration<br>is now giving way to the era<br>of implementation the era of declaration<br>he said was giving way<br>to the era of implementation what he<br>meant was that since 1945 the<br>international community has negotiated<br>or declared an impressive and extensive<br>battery<br>of international human rights<br>instruments<br>and now he was saying the time has come<br>to make these treaties<br>real to take them off the shelves and to<br>make them real<br>to implement them in everyday lives<br>so this major shift from declaring to<br>implementing has dramatic implications<br>for the united nations<br>which i've written about elsewhere very<br>briefly<br>what i call the un human rights mainland<br>such as the u.n human rights council the<br>the ua human rights mainland<br>can draft human rights can declare human<br>rights<br>but it's not designed to implement that<br>un human rights implementation has to<br>take place elsewhere<br>in u.n operational agencies such as the<br>world health organization<br>in other words in this new era of<br>human rights implementation the un needs<br>both its human rights mainland<br>such as the u.n human rights council and<br>also<br>what i call an archipelago of human<br>rights initiatives<br>which are scattered across u.n<br>operational<br>agencies now this shift<br>from declaration to implementation is<br>only<br>is not only relevant in the united<br>nations it's got dramatic<br>implications at country level<br>the land of human rights and archipelago<br>of human rights initiatives this another<br>this analogy<br>also applies in aotearoa<br>in new zealand the human rights mainland<br>includes<br>the ministry of justice crown law<br>possibly the ministry of foreign affairs<br>and trade but for the most part<br>the main land of human rights in<br>aotearoa<br>is not designed to implement human<br>rights<br>human rights implementation has to take<br>place in local and central agencies<br>such as the ministries of health<br>education and social development<br>so in this new era of implementation of<br>human rights new zealand needs<br>its human rights mainland such as the<br>ministry of justice<br>but also it needs an archipelago<br>of human rights initiatives across<br>central agencies human rights<br>implementation will be impossible in<br>this country<br>without the positive engagement of<br>mainland<br>and the archipelago in<br>aotearoa but if this<br>is correct we have to distinguish<br>compliance<br>with implementation put very simply<br>compliance is usually a tick box<br>exercise<br>late in a policy process to check<br>whether there's conformity with a law or<br>with a<br>rule that's compliance implementation is<br>totally different<br>it refers to interventions and<br>initiatives that are designed<br>to make something happen on the ground<br>in real life<br>so if our government wishes to implement<br>the right to health<br>and reduce say rheumatic fever it turns<br>to the ministry of health<br>it turns to district health boards and<br>the ministry of housing<br>as well lawyers probably from the<br>ministry of justice are likely to<br>undertake<br>to undertake a human rights compliance<br>check<br>but implementation has to be done by<br>professionals<br>working in central agencies health<br>professionals<br>housing experts educationalists<br>environmentalists<br>town planners economists and so on<br>working hand in glove with local<br>communities<br>and respecting the credo nothing about<br>us<br>without us so<br>during the era of human rights<br>implementation<br>a wide range of sexual professions have<br>to step<br>up and if we depend on lawyers<br>to implement say the right to health<br>we will all die prematurely health<br>professionals<br>have to do this with us and for us<br>but i have to say that the the<br>government has not adjusted to the era<br>of implementation heralded by kofi annan<br>in 2005.<br>in our terror human rights which<br>remember embody our values<br>in outer human rights should be on the<br>policy table they should be there early<br>in the policy making process<br>that's what's needed in the era of<br>implementation<br>human rights shaped policies and other<br>initiatives<br>the era of implementation is less about<br>going to court<br>it's more about integrating human rights<br>into policies<br>international human rights law is<br>legally binding in outer era<br>whether it's brought into our national<br>law or not international human rights<br>war is legally binding<br>in international law in new zealand<br>but integrating human rights into<br>policies<br>depends upon public officials having<br>some familiarity with human rights<br>and with a few honorable exceptions<br>central agencies<br>lack the human rights capability<br>required for this new<br>era of human rights implementation there<br>are exceptions<br>and they're largely associated with<br>disability rights<br>women's rights racism and to a limited<br>degree children's rights<br>as you would expect the ministry of<br>justice and crown law have human rights<br>capability<br>in relation to the new zealand bill of<br>rights act but this capability<br>does not extend in my experience across<br>the spectrum of international human<br>rights that are legally binding on<br>government<br>political leadership is needed to<br>elevate<br>the importance of human rights in the<br>public sector<br>in this new era of human rights<br>implementation<br>and it's really not rocket science each<br>central agency needs to have one or two<br>human rights officers who help and<br>support policymakers within their agency<br>the human rights officers would help<br>their agency colleagues to integrate<br>human rights into policies<br>and other initiatives in those agencies<br>in their turn<br>the agency's human rights officers<br>should be supported by the ministry of<br>justice<br>by the human rights commission if they<br>so wish and<br>if governments are unwilling to enhance<br>human rights capability within the<br>public service<br>if they are unwilling to bring<br>international human rights to bear upon<br>policy making initiatives<br>why bother to draft and ratify<br>now what's the role of the human rights<br>commission in all this<br>i'll be brief it has to be said the<br>human rights commission is misnamed<br>its primary focus is non-discrimination<br>and civil and political rights such as<br>the prohibition against torture and<br>freedom of speech<br>the human rights commission's primary<br>focus is not<br>the full range of human rights set out<br>in the united nations<br>civil political workers social and<br>cultural rights and the right to safe<br>environment and indigenous people's<br>rights<br>it's not just me who's saying this the<br>report of the royal commission of<br>inquiry into the terrorist attacks in<br>christchurch on the 15th of march<br>wrote this despite its name the human<br>rights act<br>only focuses on one human right the<br>right to be free from discrimination<br>one of the leading international authors<br>on national human rights institutions<br>discusses the new zealand human rights<br>commission and the canadian human rights<br>commission<br>and she says this as anti-discrimination<br>bodies<br>their focus has largely been on civil<br>political rights<br>while the commissions could promote<br>compliance with the full range of<br>international human rights<br>treaties that these countries have<br>ratified they remain<br>first and foremost anti-discrimination<br>agencies three leading<br>new zealand human rights scholar<br>practitioners at least one of whom is in<br>the room<br>described the predecessor of the human<br>rights act<br>as primarily an anti-discrimination<br>statute the earlier legislation to which<br>the authors refer<br>has now been greatly improved but in my<br>view the amendments did not alter<br>the sort of dna of the human rights<br>commission which continues to lead<br>towards non-discrimination<br>don't misunderstand me i'm not being<br>critical<br>of my predecessors nor am i being<br>critical of my fellow<br>tireless commissioners nor might be<br>critical of commissioned staff<br>i'm simply pointing out an institutional<br>bias<br>that is rooted in legislation<br>the perennial problem facing all<br>national human rights institutions<br>across the globe is how to ensure their<br>independence from government<br>and so far as i'm aware no country has<br>solved this problem<br>the new zealand government has done well<br>to put in place<br>several safeguards to ensure the human<br>rights commission's independence<br>for example an independent panel advises<br>on commissioner appointments all<br>political parties are then consulted<br>and then they decide that the final<br>decision is made by the governor general<br>following advice from the government<br>as chief commissioner i've never been<br>subjected to any<br>inappropriate pressure and i have made<br>decisions<br>without fear or favor<br>on one occasion i took a position which<br>deeply angered a high-ranking political<br>figure<br>later i discussed this with a minister<br>he brushed it off<br>he said paul you were doing your job<br>sometimes difficult questions arise and<br>i need a wide<br>range of views including from government<br>the governor's views<br>will not be determinative but i need to<br>know what they are<br>in this situation officials will<br>sometimes decline to give me a view<br>on the grounds i'm independent and i<br>often find myself saying i know i'm<br>independent<br>nonetheless i would very much welcome<br>your views<br>and i reserve the right not to adopt<br>them<br>despite the devices put in place to<br>safeguard the commission's independence<br>at the end of the day the commission as<br>an independent crown entity<br>reports to and is funded by government<br>there is no perfect alternative<br>but i tentatively suggest that there is<br>a better alternative<br>a recent ministerial review favored<br>consideration of the commissioners<br>becoming officers of parliament similar<br>to the<br>ombudsman in my opinion<br>this option should at least be<br>considered<br>considering considered in the light of<br>teeth waitangi<br>in the light of article 1 in the light<br>of article 2<br>raymond and in line of article 3<br>which i understand is a pledge of<br>equality and balance<br>i should bring my remarks<br>to a close<br>over the over the last year<br>or so the human rights commission<br>has joined forces with the national erie<br>chairs forum<br>and a non-governmental organization<br>called community housing<br>altera and we've prepared<br>what we call framework guidelines on the<br>right to a decent home in outer rubble<br>these guidelines aim to bring home<br>to aotearoa the international<br>the guidelines strive to take into<br>account<br>new zealand's unique social<br>democratic historical and legal context<br>including settler colonization<br>the guidelines aim to raise the profile<br>of the right to decent home<br>among local and national government and<br>among<br>the guidelines have recently been<br>adopted by<br>my board and they will be launched<br>in the next few weeks<br>we hope the guidelines will be used by<br>housing policymakers<br>to strengthen their efforts and by<br>rights holders<br>to hold local government central<br>government<br>and the private sector to account for<br>their<br>that it seems to me is one way to<br>refresh<br>human rights in outer role<br>we have to convey that human rights<br>embody important and dynamic<br>values we have to convey that they are<br>for everyone<br>not just some people<br>we have to bring human rights home<br>we have to contextualize them<br>we have to place them at the disposal<br>of communities we have to make them as<br>operational as possible we have to<br>insert them in policies<br>human rights are not just about me<br>they are not just about entitlements<br>they are also<br>hold duty bearers accountable for their<br>human rights promises<br>but not necessarily accountable before<br>we have to maintain a wide vision<br>although discrimination is crucially<br>important<br>fighting discrimination is absolutely<br>imperative<br>but we need a wider vision than<br>discrimination<br>we need a wider vision than civil and<br>political rights<br>we also need the um vision that we've<br>signed up to<br>we've ratified it the wider vision of<br>civil and political rights<br>non-discrimination<br>workers rights social rights<br>cultural rights the right to safe<br>environment<br>and indigenous people's rights<br>and all of that all of that underpinned<br>and reinforced by tiriti or waitangi<br>maori kite mario
