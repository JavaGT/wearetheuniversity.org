This presentation by Heike Schänzel, draws on the insights gained from 14 men reflecting on their research experiences as collated in Masculinities in the Field: Tourism and Transdisciplinary Research (2021).</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good morning everybody<br>and good morning here from wellington oh<br>good morning good evening good afternoon<br>to the rest of the world because this<br>this webinar seminar has gone live to<br>across the world so we've got people<br>from all over the<br>all over the place today speaker um<br>as an ex-phd student from<br>victoria university um and to all of us<br>we just know where's haiker<br>so heike was a phd student here under<br>under professors<br>doug pearce and professor karen smith<br>and many many many many years ago we<br>were talking about this<br>talking about this last night and that<br>phd was on family tourism<br>but since finishing at the uw hiker<br>has got is went up to auckland to aut<br>and where she's been a really big<br>success story continuing her research<br>on family tourism but also branching out<br>into other areas within<br>tourism research fundamentally on on<br>gender research<br>in today's presentation what we are not<br>talking about masculinities<br>in the field in the field of research<br>and tourism<br>as an extension of a previous book on<br>feminine on femininity in in tourism<br>so welcome and there's the book so<br>welcome hiker so without any further ado<br>i'd just like to hand over<br>to you thank you so much ian and um good<br>morning everyone and yes um i hear<br>there's<br>others watching us and listening to us<br>um<br>on the webinar online so it's a real<br>pleasure being back in wellington<br>as ian mentioned i actually graduated 11<br>years ago<br>um and i've been now at iet for<br>almost 10 years karen believe it or not<br>i know where did that time go<br>so i was at victoria university i think<br>for 12 years<br>overall so now i'm an associate<br>professor at aet but i really really<br>need to<br>acknowledge my collaborators and the<br>initial book the femininity is in the<br>book<br>a feminine disease in the field book<br>associate professor<br>porter who lives in italy and<br>that really got us starting which then<br>led<br>to oh there we go uh which led us then<br>to<br>our follow-up book on masculinities in<br>the field<br>trends tourism and transdisciplinary<br>research which i want to talk about<br>today but i also will talk a little bit<br>about the femininities in the field and<br>you might ask<br>what is a woman talking about<br>masculinities and that's probably a good<br>question<br>but i've just sort of explained myself<br>who started off as the feminine in his<br>book<br>and then we felt very strongly that<br>actually we need a book on masculinities<br>as well<br>and for this we invited my good friend<br>and colleague professor joseph chia<br>who is at wakayama university in japan<br>and he really gave us the extra insight<br>include us<br>as well right yeah that's better<br>okay right hopefully technology is<br>sorted<br>so what about gender issues in general<br>a really really good book i've very much<br>enjoyed about caroline created perez<br>uh in her book invisible women exposing<br>data bias<br>in a world designed for men states that<br>there are three main themes that crop up<br>again and again for women<br>it's a female body women's unpaid care<br>burden<br>in male violence against women these are<br>issues of such significance that they<br>touch on nearly every area of women's<br>lives<br>including conducting research in the<br>field and working as an academic<br>the same is not true for men because men<br>do not have female bodies or<br>often the same care responsibilities and<br>while men<br>may have to contend with harassment this<br>violence typically manifests in quite a<br>different way from violence faced by men<br>we also need to acknowledge in a western<br>academic context<br>that gender is thought of as being<br>overall the differences in field work<br>experiences for women and men<br>have been largely ignored and academia<br>has proceeded as if the male body and<br>its attendant life experience are the<br>tender neutral default<br>it is only through more reflective<br>exercises that detended nature fieldwork<br>and research is beginning to emerge<br>and this is of course where our book<br>compilations on femininities and<br>masculinities in the field come in<br>the consensus is that field space<br>reminds a masculine construct<br>and that's the idea of general privilege<br>accompanying masculinity in masculine<br>spaces<br>the underlying sentiment here is that<br>this is still very much a man's world in<br>which really leads me to talk about our<br>first<br>book on femininities in the field which<br>was published in 2018<br>it started out with women's field<br>experiences in<br>what are we not talking about it was<br>about the influential experiences in the<br>field<br>deliberately omitted by women not only<br>from their doctoral thesis<br>but also from the academic tourism<br>literature<br>many women reported that this was the<br>most cathartic<br>and rewarding writing they have ever<br>done as an academic such as reflecting<br>on taking their baby to the field<br>for example to the acting and this is<br>what susan frolick had to say about her<br>reflection of bringing her baby to<br>everest base camp when conducting<br>research she published this amazing<br>paper in 2002<br>it is about the embodied entanglements<br>that play out between ourselves<br>or subjectivities and our research sites<br>both before and while we are in the<br>field and it is about something we as<br>academics do not talk about<br>soon after finishing this book<br>compilation it became obvious that the<br>need for more masculine perspectives on<br>fieldwork was also pressing<br>despite some criticism our original aims<br>remain unchanged our call for equality<br>is in recognizing that gender issues and<br>fieldwork<br>are deserving of our attention in doing<br>so we acknowledge that viewing the field<br>as a masculine space is defunct<br>what about gender and tourism research<br>traditionally tourism research has been<br>chained appliance<br>and most studies in tourism make no<br>mention of any gender considerations<br>it's only really in more recent years<br>that research into gender have<br>almost exclusively come from female<br>researchers in from a feminist lens<br>as a result gender studies have<br>consistently failed to excite the<br>imagination of media the general public<br>or the wider social science academy<br>because gender is still acquainted with<br>studies of women's experiences<br>we do have to acknowledge that there is<br>increasing gender diversity<br>and seeing gender as a spectrum and<br>non-binary is still lacking<br>maybe one day we break free from binary<br>conceptualizations of male and female<br>well we can dream isn't it but there's<br>still a long way to go until then<br>masculinities and tourism research is<br>also lacking including studies on<br>fatherhood<br>so my background as ian mentioned at the<br>beginning is family research and tourism<br>and to my knowledge i'm still just about<br>the only one researching fatherhood<br>and tourism why you might ask<br>so you might ask what about masculinity<br>studies<br>have you even heard of masculinity<br>studies<br>let me tell you a little bit more about<br>that masculinity is in plural<br>acknowledges that there is more than one<br>way to be a man<br>at a deeper level it has long been<br>argued that masculinities are<br>multifarious in conception<br>this untold complexities and<br>contradictions in that<br>invocations of masculinities as<br>straightforward<br>and simplistic are counterproductive to<br>fostering optimum gender relations<br>masculinities as a field of study<br>continues to lag behind<br>research on femininities some progress<br>is being made as reflected in the centre<br>for the study of men<br>and masculinities at stony brook<br>university<br>part of the state university of new york<br>system which began<br>offering a master's degree in<br>masculinity studies in 2019<br>this means that masculinity studies at a<br>postgraduate level<br>have only been in existence for two<br>years<br>so you can see we still got a very long<br>way to go<br>masculinity studies is described as<br>offering a framework to break down<br>so-called toxic masculinity<br>seen as affecting people of all genders<br>there's also increasing public debate<br>about masculinities including in new<br>zealand such as the he'll be right<br>masculinity podcast that was<br>um published by stuff.co.net<br>which are about the search of the right<br>way to be a man in 2021<br>and reflect on modern masculinities in<br>our tiara<br>however this reflexivity is still<br>missing in debates and tourism research<br>for decades now female writers and<br>theorists have been dismantling their<br>biological gender from the perceived<br>feminine<br>roles that can restrict or harm their<br>lives<br>but it's only recently that we have<br>started to do this with men too<br>to see a man as distinct from the<br>concept of and construct of masculinity<br>and that really leads me to the book and<br>there's a copy there as well<br>so this was published it actually came<br>out this year masculinity<br>in the field our book compilation on<br>masculinities in the field for which we<br>invited my colleague<br>and friend joseph cheer to contribute<br>and give us some kind of authority<br>after all we were women entering the<br>field of masculinities in needed an<br>authentic<br>male voice so what are we not talking<br>about<br>the reflective accounts of gendered<br>field experiences<br>exploring the question of what it means<br>masculinity is fundamentally defined as<br>the quality of being male<br>while this is simplistic the purpose of<br>this book compilation was not to<br>challenge the construction<br>and or deconstruction of masculinity<br>instead our aim was to create a space<br>where the performances of masculinities<br>in academia field spaces can be explored<br>we set out to establish how the<br>performance of masculinities plays out<br>in the field by asking researchers all<br>of whom are<br>male 14 in total contributing<br>heart gender has influenced and shaped<br>their research practice<br>we recruited our contributors through<br>convenience sampling mainly by tapping<br>male scholars we knew on their shoulder<br>it was about<br>advancing the attention of chin and<br>white buyers and fieldwork<br>this time through a masculine lens in<br>showcasing why the wider academy must<br>were<br>the 14 contributors were self-defined<br>self-reflexive<br>using first-person accounts describing<br>the constructs of varying masculinities<br>and the sometimes fluid<br>and contextual performance of<br>masculinities<br>reflections on masculinities were coming<br>in many personal forms and were<br>organized in four parts<br>part one hegemonic and heteronormative<br>masculinities looks at what it means to<br>be a<br>manly man part two performing<br>heteronormative masculinities<br>the contributors reflect on gender and<br>sexuality<br>in their influence on fieldwork and<br>gendered performance<br>part three situated masculinities<br>explores the intersections of<br>gender ethnicities and cross-cultural<br>experiences<br>part four paternal masculinities<br>reflects an<br>accompanied fieldwork as a father<br>researcher and explores the intricacies<br>of fatherhood and field research<br>interestingly we had difficulties to<br>find contributors to reflect on their<br>fatherhood and field research<br>i will illustrate the four parts with a<br>contributed contributors reflection each<br>in by letting the contributors speak for<br>themselves<br>it is interesting to note that whereas<br>none of the female contributors in our<br>femininities<br>question their femininity all the men in<br>this book question to some extent what<br>it means to be a man<br>today and seemingly distance themselves<br>from being part of the emergent<br>a theme that goes throughout<br>this book so i start off as an example<br>there's a book chapter by<br>who wrote about it's okay to cry<br>encouraging emotional writing among<br>male tourism scholars and this is part<br>of the hegemonic and heteronormative<br>masculinities<br>and this is what jack had to say what we<br>are saying to a boy when we tell him to<br>man up or act like a man<br>at its most benign we might be saying do<br>the things that needs doing if you<br>even if you don't want to do it but more<br>often<br>when we tell a boy to act like a man<br>we're effectively saying<br>stop expressing those feelings and if<br>the boy hears that often enough<br>it actually starts to sound uncannily<br>like stop feeling those feelings<br>as boys grow up so does their<br>masculinity<br>it becomes stricter its expectations<br>heavier<br>it is okay to bumble your ways through<br>masculinity as a boy<br>but not as a man as a man you have to<br>start perfecting the art of what it<br>means to be masculine<br>a masculinity that teaches boys and men<br>not to talk about emotions<br>boys don't cry as a result it's not so<br>much act your age but actual gender<br>check highlights how the supremacy of<br>obstinacy and the rejection of emotion<br>as key cornerstones<br>of western masculinity entrench<br>themselves in manhood<br>he reflects on the way we produce<br>knowledge<br>the masculine approach to tourism<br>studies divided by scholars as<br>positivistic<br>objective and emotionless this is about<br>the primacy of masculinity in our<br>academy<br>maintaining a facade of objectivity<br>pretending that the researcher can enter<br>the field<br>as an emotionless detached observer<br>it is about the way tourism studies show<br>a disregard for emotional writings<br>and how western epistemology view the<br>placing of emotion and reason as<br>incompatible<br>this necklace that emotions are integral<br>to our understanding of the world<br>and after all tourism is an emotional<br>experience right<br>by rejecting emotions in research we<br>also dehumanize<br>dehumanize do you humanize those we<br>study sorry<br>so how to bring emotions back into our<br>scholarship<br>how to bring humanity and its emotions<br>and sensibilities closer to the center<br>of what we do as a researcher and these<br>were questions we also post for our<br>femininities book<br>czech use used ortho-ethnography as a<br>method by using personal stories to<br>explore societal issues<br>this is about putting reflexivity in<br>emotions central to our understanding of<br>culture<br>autoindustry autonomous autoenography<br>is still in its infancy within tourism<br>with me<br>not taking the reflexive driving scene<br>it can encourage us to embrace and<br>reveal the multiple selves that we bring<br>with us<br>into the field and allowing the<br>cacophony of voices<br>kept reflected on his subjective<br>experiences of tourism within contested<br>spaces<br>in besliham and palestine in doing so he<br>unleashed the pandora's box of the<br>epistemology of emotion<br>that men had self-consciously captured<br>as such in this chapter czech's<br>reflection is about<br>going deeper you using autoethnography<br>and encouraging emotional and more<br>truthful writing among<br>i now want to move on to the next part<br>performing heteronormative masculinities<br>and this contribution is based on<br>richard aquino's reflection on his<br>performance of filipino masculinity<br>in the field and how his performed<br>masculinity affected his interaction<br>with research participants richard is<br>filipino he was my master he was my<br>master and my phd student<br>but has been living in new zealand for<br>several years as an openly gay man<br>however going back to the philippines<br>and conducting research in rural<br>communities required him to go back into<br>the closet<br>this is his reflection on his identity<br>and sense of masculinity<br>and about packaging his masculine self<br>to fit with more traditional filipino<br>masculinity<br>like many colonized territories western<br>colonialism has distorted traditional<br>gender roles and ideologies in the<br>philippines<br>pre-colonial societies in the<br>philippines had enjoyed sexually<br>egalitarian social structures<br>yet the introduction of roman<br>catholicism through spanish<br>colonialization<br>has embedded misogyny and patriarchy in<br>native philippine cultures<br>with consequent changes to gender roles<br>in relations in the country<br>today filipina society is largely<br>considered patriarchal with traditional<br>views on gender roles implying<br>that men should convey a strong<br>character in image in society<br>as a right as a result men not<br>conforming to this hegemonic filipino<br>masculinity<br>are labeled as gay with homosexuality<br>richard's community-based research<br>approach required his immersion in the<br>field<br>this required the negotiation of his<br>gender and sexuality to fit the<br>standards of traditional filipino<br>masculinity<br>his main priority was to prepare for the<br>practicalities of conducting field<br>research<br>so packing for his gender performance is<br>not explicitly linked with the letter<br>he acknowledges that while in the field<br>he must keep his masculinity in place to<br>be respected<br>and to establish his credibility as a<br>researcher<br>having this agenda in mind means<br>packaging himself to conform to the<br>hegemonic image of a filipino male<br>through his closing language actions and<br>interactions with<br>others his main concern became acting<br>approximately masculine to try and fit<br>in<br>this performance required participating<br>in drinking culture<br>accepting boys comments and jokes and<br>conforming to other masculine behavior<br>he also experienced performance anxiety<br>when encountering sexist<br>masculine jokes and stigmatizing<br>homosexual comments<br>or when he felt that he was not<br>conforming well to the local masculine<br>image<br>richard speaks of having to wear masks<br>when he is in the field<br>to establish rapport and form<br>professional relationships with his<br>research participants<br>without deceiving them at least until<br>homosexuality is more accepted in the<br>philippines<br>so in a sense performing heteronormative<br>masculinities for non-heterosexual<br>non-heterosexual male researchers is<br>then strongly configured in relation to<br>their experience struggles<br>for acceptance and normalization in<br>something we do not talk about<br>we managed to include two contributors<br>reflecting on this performance in the<br>book<br>now moving to part three situated<br>masculinities and this contribution<br>is by my co-editor and good colleague<br>and friend joseph cheer<br>so he reflects about his performance of<br>masculinity and field research<br>and how he is negotiated and shaped by<br>cross-cultural context<br>this is central to much fieldwork<br>especially in cross-cultural contexts<br>whereas patriarchal structures<br>underline extended societies this<br>reflection travels with mutual's<br>assertion that in invoking masculinities<br>and research we are compelled to develop<br>frameworks<br>that will fully capture the complexities<br>of men lives<br>for my researches cross-cultural<br>contexts that challenge normative<br>understandings of masculinity and<br>mildness<br>and especially the appropriate placement<br>of women in society<br>can be confronting discomforting an<br>alien<br>this is particularly the case when our<br>notions of masculinity are departure<br>from the encounter in the field<br>negotiating dissonance between fieldwork<br>attitudes towards masculinities and the<br>superstructures around what it means to<br>be a man<br>alongside contrasting notions evident in<br>cross-cultural fieldwork encounters<br>sow the seeds for a range of emotions<br>including bewilderment<br>discontent apprehension and abhorrence<br>among others<br>this tends to occur when in-situ<br>masculinities are severely at odds with<br>what researchers are usually accustomed<br>to<br>for joseph it is evident that the upshot<br>of a mixed race in multicultural<br>background<br>has had a profound influence on his<br>construction<br>of self and the attitudes and<br>perspectives attached to it<br>his research perspective steeped in the<br>asia pacific<br>while maintaining pan-asian eurasian<br>identities<br>gives him both etic and emic<br>perspectives or insider outside<br>perspectives<br>for his research in vanuatu<br>joseph was quickly impressed by many of<br>the participants of his research on<br>account of his specific heritage<br>privileged by belonging to a pacific<br>brotherhood and defined an opposition to<br>the fact<br>that he was not a bislama or white man<br>of european descent<br>in guanajuato the performance of<br>masculinity is largely<br>representative of masculinities in<br>melanation context more generally<br>where an abiding dominance of the<br>patriarchy in indigenous institutions<br>persists<br>during field work the gender position he<br>encountered privileged male authority<br>where women also valued for their<br>contributions to public and private life<br>dominate the keeping of the domestic<br>domain<br>this meant that also he sought a more<br>representative sample of community<br>attitudes increasing socialities<br>subordinated potential female<br>participants<br>meaning that most participants in his<br>field work were men<br>this made the space he inhabited an<br>overwhelmingly male domain<br>so how to deal with this as a self<br>self-defined social progressive<br>how can the voices of women be amplified<br>in the pursuit of sustainable<br>development of tourism<br>these are all practical constraints that<br>all researchers face<br>in situations where the in-situ culture<br>is much different to what we are<br>accustomed to<br>however when male researchers are<br>expected to conform to the local<br>and patriarchal context challenging<br>these norms can be risky<br>hearing was the dilemma he faced in the<br>demonstration of his masculinity<br>should he go along with the structures<br>in place or<br>to try to bend them toward what he saw<br>was most acceptable<br>instead he downplayed his own socially<br>constructed normative understandings<br>to abide by what was customary at the<br>field study site<br>also he encountered mild moral anxiety<br>given that as a socially progressive<br>male he sees the merits in addressing<br>the impacts of patriarchal dominance<br>this is what joseph had to say about<br>situated masculinities<br>for researchers and in particular my<br>research is coming into the country with<br>very different<br>conceptualizations of gender discourses<br>the practice of individual masculinities<br>in the field<br>needs to be given greater importance in<br>field work planning and preparation<br>very often foreign male researchers<br>intervenoratu confronted with having<br>little understanding of the country's<br>cultural norms<br>while also disadvantaged by their lack<br>of adeptness in the local language<br>male researchers would do well to<br>examine and understand the ways<br>pre-existing masculinities are conceived<br>of and applied at each of the study<br>sites they work in<br>especially if they are diametrically<br>this now leads me<br>to part four the last part paternal<br>masculinities<br>stewart reed reflected on the masculine<br>entanglements of family in<br>field and field in family in his chapter<br>traditionally the personal professional<br>entanglements of family and field are<br>mainly from female points of views<br>this was the case for our femininities<br>book where i<br>for example reflected on my accompanied<br>research with my two daughters<br>until when doing field work in samoa on<br>family tourism<br>having children miss me gave me instant<br>access in a level of trust when<br>recruiting other families<br>however when it came to reflections on<br>paternal masculinities we had<br>difficulties finding male researchers<br>who are fathers<br>to reflect on their accompanied research<br>experiences<br>i met stuart at a conference in finland<br>in 2018.<br>stuart and his middle aged man so he did<br>his phd at a later stage stuart is<br>originally from<br>australia but he decided to move his<br>family of three children and wife to<br>sweden for his phd research<br>stuart's reflection is about solving the<br>personal professional dilemma<br>by bringing his family with him to the<br>field in setting the stage for<br>accompanied field work<br>in sweden this is what stewart had to<br>say<br>as a heterosexual married man who is a<br>father to three young children i<br>occupy family roles as husband and<br>father<br>and these circumstantial positions<br>variously activate masculinities of<br>fatherhood and husbandhood in<br>all the domains of social life including<br>when i'm a researcher in the field<br>chief among his concern was his<br>perceived masculine duty as husband and<br>it became apparent for him that family<br>care<br>in homemaking burdens of field<br>relocation work<br>are both uneven and gendered privileging<br>the one who is the researcher at expense<br>of the one who's not<br>and likely more so when this happens to<br>be a male<br>he acknowledged that most of this work<br>was done by his wife<br>he also reflected that not only did each<br>instance of family distress<br>render the culture shock cost of<br>accompanied fieldwork a parent<br>but also signaled a personal failure to<br>however on the plus side when taking his<br>children along on field research<br>his children became incidental adjuncts<br>to his research<br>enterprise through their active<br>involvement in these spaces<br>also some of the disruptions of family<br>afforded many new insights into his<br>research<br>such as having to take his son to the<br>toilet which allowed him insights into<br>the backstage<br>of his field site additionally his<br>husband<br>fatherhood afforded entry points for<br>discussions just as for women<br>accompanied research involving families<br>can be a resource facilitating fieldwork<br>enabling interactions and revealing<br>aspects of the field that might<br>otherwise remain obscure<br>as a result his masculinities of<br>fatherhood and husbandhood became part<br>of his research<br>his conclusion was that for researchers<br>who have families<br>the masculinities are rising in the<br>intersection of family<br>and field are always essentially present<br>and that family influences in the field<br>which has been acknowledged by women<br>are still rare by men as i mentioned<br>before we managed to have two<br>contributors in our book reflecting on<br>their paternal<br>there are questions about what it means<br>to be a man<br>which is continually being reshaped amid<br>the ongoing resetting of gender<br>relations<br>research into gender is almost<br>exclusively from<br>female researchers and much of this is<br>focused on the quest for equality<br>empowerment and inclusiveness in tourism<br>however integrating considerations of<br>gender into research practice<br>should be imperative yet for many<br>contributors thinking about gender and<br>the application of their masculinity<br>was unprecedented furthermore that the<br>minors of contributors could influence<br>their research practice and somehow<br>potentially shape their field with<br>outcomes was rarely acknowledged if at<br>all<br>consider fieldwork planning and research<br>design phases<br>this highlights a rethink of how<br>masculinities are conceived of and acted<br>out in academic practice<br>and provides a sense that a narrow<br>definition of masculinity<br>is not serving anyone be it in academia<br>or<br>in the public it also questions the<br>sense that hegemonic masculinities are<br>not needing consideration or reflections<br>instead scholarship or masculinities can<br>make a difference in fostering a shared<br>sense towards a more inclusive humanity<br>and this should be something we should<br>all strive towards<br>we finished off our book this emerged<br>inquiries<br>we couldn't really give you answers but<br>we do have several questions and i can't<br>necessarily give you answers<br>what does it mean to be a man that was<br>really the<br>pervasive theme throughout the book this<br>is the overarching theme emerging from<br>our contributors and is related to the<br>all-consuming effort<br>to proving to be a man anywhere in the<br>world<br>which in fact can seem a ridiculous and<br>anachronistic concept<br>women would never entertain the concept<br>of proving that they are women<br>definitely never arose in our feminine<br>facebook<br>for female researchers the struggles<br>were largely in the world around them<br>while for male researchers the struggles<br>were often from the inside<br>why does this matter because it gets us<br>to the heart of the gender issue<br>in that identifying the diverse types of<br>manliness can help us understand<br>areas of concern and ways forward beyond<br>the need for having to define what it<br>means to be a man and the need for any<br>proof<br>why the resistance to emotional<br>entanglements<br>for the most part authors reflected a<br>combination of ambivalence<br>and uncertainty when it came to<br>emotional entanglements<br>and these eventually presented as<br>resistance however that<br>generally heterosexual men shy away from<br>emotional entanglement might be changing<br>due to a shift in generational attitudes<br>we are seeing increasing debates about<br>gender diversity in today's society so<br>why not in academia<br>why are masculinity still taken for<br>granted<br>how is the dominance of masculinity<br>shaping research insights and knowledge<br>production processes<br>how is access to research sites and<br>participants gendered<br>several contributors lamented that by<br>virtue of being male their access to<br>certain research sites and contexts was<br>constrained<br>but where do we draw the line in<br>allowing males access to women only safe<br>spaces<br>should they have access should we all<br>have access to different spaces<br>how do we include a spectrum of<br>masculinities<br>in relation to vulnerable masculinities<br>the experiences and challenges<br>of non-heteronormative contributors and<br>those from ethnically diverse<br>backgrounds in this volume<br>is testament that developing<br>competencies to successfully negotiate<br>particular masculinities is vital<br>how do we address toxic masculinities<br>how should we include the consideration<br>of masculinities in research practice<br>one way would be to actively and<br>immediately consider adding a gender<br>dimension to research training<br>reflecting on both femininities and<br>masculinities<br>to expand and deepen tourism research<br>with a truer tinder perspective<br>in the end our learnings and insights<br>are not about gender itself<br>but that we all possess the same<br>humanity that we are one which requires<br>constant deep reflection to counter any<br>possible imbalances due to gender<br>ethnicity or otherwise<br>so thank you for listening and i'm of<br>course more than happy to answer your<br>questions<br>but i also would like to remind you that<br>i only presented some of the voices of<br>our 14 male contributors in that i<br>cannot speak for them<br>because this is after all their book and<br>i was only really an editor<br>and i also would like to mention if you<br>would like to<br>buy the book we've actually got a 40<br>discount that applies until the end of<br>july<br>and the code is you know oh it's not<br>very well to see<br>mitf40 or you can actually contact me<br>for detail<br>so thank you for listening and i'm sure<br>you've had lots of<br>questions<br>thank you very much um thank you very<br>much so<br>to our audience online if you put your<br>questions<br>into the q a session if you want to ask<br>any questions we'll be able to we'll be<br>able to pick them up<br>but i'm just wondering if there's<br>anybody who would like to start the ball<br>rolling any questions or emerging issues<br>you'd like to ask<br>doug uh sorry can i just ask you to<br>talk into that i should<br>stay here just to comment on<br>the titles of your two books saying one<br>of the points you raise and<br>your major queries are your titles are<br>femininities and masculinities in the<br>field<br>as a geographer i would argue that there<br>are many different sorts of fields<br>and by putting field into the plural you<br>would gain much greater insight into<br>some of these issues<br>okay that's a good point yep yep<br>we had initially i think field research<br>so then it became yeah<br>that's a good point yep thank you i<br>thank you guilty at the moment of<br>putting the emphasis<br>on the plurals on one side but not only<br>yes no that's a good point thank you yes<br>yep<br>um you also say thanks not throwing it<br>doug<br>thank you for sharing it was really<br>interesting i got a little bit<br>distracted during the summer by<br>clicking through the copy that you'd<br>place in front front of us<br>and um one of the things i was really<br>interested in i just happened to open a<br>couple of pages it happened to be where<br>those<br>um writers were reflecting on this was<br>around<br>the sort of profile of your respondents<br>in terms of their seniority<br>and it was interesting you shared an<br>example say from richard about his<br>phd research but you also have more<br>senior academics<br>in here as well and i wondered if you<br>can't have any reflections<br>on or they have reflections on their<br>seniority<br>in relation to the topic yes so we've<br>got one chapter from neil carr professor<br>near carr<br>and he very much actually reflected on<br>his whole yeah exactly he reflected very<br>much on his home journey yeah so we had<br>some phd students but we also had some<br>senior<br>so probably neocast chapter in he his<br>whole journey and how he came about<br>and also actually very much about not<br>being toxic masculine or heteronormative<br>masculinity and we also had professor<br>mark orens<br>and he and he admittedly he really<br>struggled writing that<br>that chapter he had to go three goes i<br>think but he<br>persevered um and admittedly he never<br>reflected on his masculinity so that was<br>actually really interesting but we<br>deliberately and yeah we very much<br>shoulder attacked<br>so it was never an open call who we knew<br>because it was difficult i think we<br>wouldn't have managed with an open call<br>i don't think people would have<br>responded<br>um so some were cornered somewhere quite<br>happy to participate some took forever<br>to finish their chapters<br>but yeah do you feel um<br>that those who perhaps more senior were<br>able to reflect<br>more openly about this or had they<br>created an identity that they<br>potentially were now challenging in a in<br>well nier carl was quite okay because i<br>think he works in these<br>fields but mark oran struggled<br>and i think that's where sort of a<br>generation<br>difference as well the younger<br>generation is much more we have so many<br>more debates about gender<br>stop in society as the younger<br>generation that's the whole<br>non-binary and so on so i think there's<br>definitely a difference so i think if i<br>would go to some<br>senior academics and ask them to reflect<br>i think<br>depending on what kind of research<br>they've done in the past that probably<br>would struggle much more than<br>maybe current phd students so i<br>certainly like that you had got a cross<br>section of of um but ages<br>as well and that's that's fine yeah we<br>tried to get geographic<br>as well look it's it was quite difficult<br>in the end to get<br>contributors like i said we managed to<br>actually then get two fathers to<br>reflect but that was sort of difficult<br>luckily i met stuart<br>um at a conference so it's sometimes<br>these incidental<br>you know how you meet people but yeah so<br>we tried we had to sort of from an<br>african context<br>because that's the thing it's sort of<br>geographical we have to be careful as<br>well<br>because so much in academia is from an<br>english speaking perspective so we<br>actually had some<br>from french canada so there was some<br>really good contributors as well<br>so that's sort of another thing we have<br>to be aware of what are we talking about<br>what kind of masculinities<br>are they all you know english-speaking<br>ones or are they actually wider<br>um i mean in many ways i think the way<br>we look at it<br>this opens the debate really and more<br>needs to be done<br>and hopefully it keeps rolling and there<br>will be other publications maybe from it<br>as well thank you<br>thank you karen thank you we've got a<br>couple of questions online<br>um and the first question is from lisa<br>raymond who's a<br>phd student here and and her question is<br>did any of your participants reflect on<br>field research conducted in<br>new zealand and she'd be curious to hear<br>about their experiences<br>probably mark orums partly that<br>um who else god no i have to have a look<br>as well<br>we had something you said in<br>contributors um i mean richard went<br>no i think everyone else was actually<br>yes only partly mark orbs i think so<br>yeah<br>so we have a second question from kevin<br>wallace and<br>um congratulate you on the book thank<br>you<br>looks excellent in the terms of a lot of<br>field research and the question from<br>kevin is did any contributors<br>reflect on other methodologies and the<br>potential<br>gender framing and the dynamics involved<br>other than autoethnography yes uh<br>some did ethnography but it's all<br>related around that autoinography or<br>actually reflecting afterwards after<br>they've been<br>doing research i mean richards he did<br>grounded theory so this was just a<br>reflection<br>as part of her phd so not everyone did<br>autoignography i think some framed it<br>around that whole idea<br>now i'm i'm looking back on what i've<br>done the research i've did<br>and if i would take an auto econograph<br>lens<br>and i've got a third question from uh<br>online as well from<br>daniel chen who asked the question<br>um thank you for a wonderful<br>presentation um<br>the speaker mentioned that gender is<br>performative<br>in your opinion which factors will<br>influence this<br>where to open the door which<br>yeah i don't think i can answer that<br>because there's all sorts of literature<br>about the whole performance<br>uh on on masculinity and that's where<br>sort of richard aquina talked about a<br>mask<br>um if you look at the australian author<br>he does research from families and<br>fatherhood and<br>he actually says all men wear masks so<br>i think this is uh something much wider<br>than i could probably<br>answer here and i think that's part of<br>actually reflecting on that whether<br>we're all performing<br>i'm performing at the moment i'm<br>performing i'm trying to be a woman and<br>being academic<br>and be taken serious so i don't know<br>um so it's part of that and i think<br>by reflecting on that one going into the<br>field as well are we<br>and and ken singh actually reflected on<br>that one<br>being the academic but actually also<br>being a<br>gay man so that's sort of sometimes<br>these this overlaps do we have different<br>i'll ask a question um if that's okay um<br>if you were to do volume 2 the second<br>edition of this book<br>what would probably be in it in the<br>second edition what would probably<br>well ideally it would be a third edition<br>i actually would like to see um<br>gender diversity just get away with<br>binaries not masculinity or femininities<br>but actually uh<br>yeah gender diversity and be much more<br>get away from that binary thinking<br>really yeah<br>that would be my dream but i don't i<br>mean i think we still got a long way to<br>go for that one so<br>in line with that i've got a question um<br>so in<br>relatively recent research we've seen a<br>stronger focus on<br>feminist research paradigms and<br>interpreting collecting data through a<br>feminist lens<br>which you know on the one hand is lovely<br>but<br>do we also need a masculine lens or<br>would that actually<br>be a step back and we need a gender<br>diverse non-binary lens<br>what are your thoughts on that probably<br>the yeah it's a very good question<br>i mean i i do a lot of reviewing and up<br>with<br>and i've looked into this before when<br>you put in gender in tourism<br>you will invariably everything that<br>comes up is from a female perspective<br>and i get a little bit annoyed by that<br>as well because i don't think<br>you can do that you know i think then at<br>least say it's female gender<br>you know to make it clearer because we<br>can't just we need to get away from that<br>idea gender is automatically all women's<br>experiences and i made a point about<br>that but as well<br>so i always actually felt very strongly<br>and that was my family tourism research<br>as well as karen<br>induct would know i did a whole family<br>research because i was very adamant that<br>i wanted to include everyone including<br>fathers and that still hasn't been done<br>my feeling is really we need to branch<br>out it needs to go much broader<br>and maybe we actually need to go into<br>gender diversity<br>some would say we've always had a<br>masculine lens<br>if you go back to a lot of research<br>because you know in the 80s and 90s you<br>read any research papers and it's always<br>it says the tourist he<br>it's always equated you know it's always<br>a suit it was always made by the form<br>so we have to be careful in that sense<br>as well<br>but i think it's more what i spoke about<br>particularly czech shepherd<br>um in others it's including different<br>voices of masculinities<br>more emotions different autoimmune<br>again in his chapter he did um a bit of<br>research and most<br>autonomy is actually being conducted by<br>women or if there are male authors it's<br>quite often the<br>supervisors of um female students<br>so and i think that really needs to<br>change where we need to get away from<br>thinking only objective<br>research counts but actually have much<br>more<br>wider and different ways of conducting<br>research and having<br>reflective sections i think going<br>forward<br>i get all my research students who at<br>least have some reflective sections in<br>their master's<br>thesis or phds it's a step towards that<br>but also thinking<br>about different ways we conduct research<br>as well<br>i have it's actually a question to doug<br>pierce<br>it's actually a question to doug pierce<br>so<br>um it's a question from one of our ex<br>master students amelia would you like to<br>know when is the second edition<br>of your book frameworks of tourism<br>uh it's not on the program at the moment<br>there was<br>sufficient interest i guess we could<br>revive it i think<br>i think this is evidence of<br>international interest<br>uh sorry emilia says ha ha<br>i've got a question for you if you you<br>know you finish the book you've done<br>the two books um if you had a<br>you know a potential phd came to see you<br>said i'd like to do a phd<br>in this topic what's the one emerging<br>theme or topic that's come from the both<br>books<br>you'd like that phd student to go away<br>and<br>delve into and do some deep research oof<br>it probably would be auto ethnographies<br>or ethnography i mean you could probably<br>and interview other other men on their<br>experiences we've actually continued<br>because when we finished that<br>femininities book we felt like<br>and quite a few women actually came<br>forward and said listen<br>it's great but we don't really want to<br>have a job chapter published we don't<br>want to have our names<br>in it so we actually continued and um<br>interviewed<br>more women anonymously because more<br>things came out so maybe something like<br>this as well<br>because not everyone is prepared to<br>write a chapter or be you know really<br>open about it so maybe a phd<br>about actually finding out from other<br>men different<br>different levels different research<br>fields<br>on their experiences and their thoughts<br>and there might be actually more<br>revealing things coming out that you<br>don't necessarily reflect this your name<br>on in a chapter<br>okay okay okay any questions anything<br>else<br>let's talk about the box i'm<br>uh in the past there's been a lot of<br>emphasis<br>on advancing research through doing<br>multi-disciplinary work<br>to what extent is there a way forward in<br>terms of doing<br>multi-gendered research where you have<br>two or more<br>different genders uh working on the same<br>topic<br>and integrated from the start i think it<br>would be brilliant<br>and i think that would get a get around<br>a lot of issues<br>i absolutely agree i mean from our<br>femininities book we actually found<br>particularly<br>i mean women who my age or with children<br>they get instant access to communities<br>it's much easier for women to talk to<br>other women particularly if they have a<br>baby<br>in tow or married or things like this so<br>yes so we probably have to think much<br>harder about that<br>you know how to actually get access so i<br>reflected on joseph cheer<br>who did research in vanuatu it probably<br>would have helped a lot if there was a<br>female researcher<br>um who maybe then actually would have<br>been able to<br>you know to talk to to the women in the<br>fit you know in in the village<br>colleague porter who did research in the<br>philippines and she reflected<br>in a chapter that once she had a baby<br>she did um<br>research in the philippines in a very<br>remote fishing fishing<br>village as soon as she had a baby she<br>had a very very different access<br>to um to the people living in the<br>village to the women but also to the men<br>she was no longer threat she's got a<br>baby<br>and other women can relate to that so<br>yeah it's a very good question<br>maybe i think and that's probably<br>something that came true is our<br>femininities book as well very much<br>that idea of actually sending one<br>research out into the field<br>probably needs to be questioned i mean<br>for women quite often it's for safety<br>issues<br>but in general actually you know maybe<br>would be much better<br>different gender research groups they<br>have different skills different<br>advantages and disadvantages so yeah<br>very good question<br>but it also gets away from that lone<br>researcher and that's the<br>original narrative of the lone<br>researcher doing objective research and<br>i think both these books prove<br>that well that's actually not the case<br>because all research is subjective<br>opportunities any questions online<br>just another haha from amelia oh<br>sorry another question has come through<br>and another question from dennis<br>tolka<br>his question is all contributors seem<br>rather progressive<br>did you try to find a contributor who<br>would represent tosca<br>toxic masculinity good question<br>probably not yeah i mean you see<br>this is where it would be interesting to<br>do be a phd<br>because i doubt they would have<br>volunteered to contribute<br>correct they would struggle with the<br>reflection itself yeah like i said mark<br>orange freckled<br>and he would be probably progressive but<br>he's still the you know<br>so yeah good question<br>dennis yes do you want to volunteer<br>um what were the emergence<br>how are the emerging themes different<br>from this the book you did here with<br>the book he did on feminist femininity<br>in the field<br>oh it's very different very different<br>like i said for the women<br>not once reflected women don't reflect<br>on being female<br>every chapter to some extent reflected<br>on what it means to be<br>a man so obviously there is a big<br>question mark<br>there yeah so women for women was always<br>about<br>dealing with sexual harassment or taking<br>care of themselves or having children<br>with them<br>so it was always outside of them and how<br>to you know deal with that<br>or access or access conduct<br>the way you dress in all of that whereas<br>all the men reflected on what it means<br>to be a man<br>and what masculinities means but also<br>actually very much<br>no i'm not toxic masculinity no that's<br>not me<br>so distancing themselves from that as<br>well<br>okay and i think that seems to be quite<br>like that i mean that's sort of<br>happening in new zealand now as well<br>isn't it this<br>that he'll be right and there's other<br>movements<br>uh men's sheds getting them to talk<br>about emotions<br>and revealing so we do have an issue<br>here in new zealand as well<br>so uh so our book actually starts with<br>czech shepherds<br>and that's a great chapter boys do not<br>cry so if you want to read one thing<br>and i think that's what you know it's it<br>opens a whole pandora's box off<br>yeah absolutely brilliant and so there's<br>no more questions<br>um just one final plug what was the c<br>what was the discount code<br>oh hang on mitf40<br>all that can contact me and i send them<br>the link brilliant that's fine<br>so uh channel few thank you um yes<br>so until the end of july 40 discount<br>mitf40<br>okay so everybody's got that across the<br>this webinar has been recorded so we'll<br>be put on victoria university's website<br>and it'll go on to youtube and that kind<br>of thing so<br>it'll be there for us a permanent record<br>and but hiker absolutely brilliant<br>and i just remember you 10 years ago<br>as a we phd student graduated and we we<br>decided one day<br>oh let's write a book it just happened<br>i know on on family tourism and<br>you've gone on from there in terms of<br>progression academic discipline and<br>establishing yourself<br>as a great associate professor up at the<br>aut<br>so um thank you um absolutely yeah so<br>thank you ian and thank you victoria<br>university and thank you for coming and<br>thank you for attending in the webinar<br>thank you the next webinar the next<br>hybrid seminar webinar seminar will be<br>on the 31st of<br>august with professor kathleen schuff<br>from<br>thompson rivers university and john<br>allen the<br>ceo of wellington nz and they'll be<br>talking about<br>um creative tourism in small places<br>so it's all about smallness and<br>creativity in terms of placement<br>so that'll be on the 31st of august and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
