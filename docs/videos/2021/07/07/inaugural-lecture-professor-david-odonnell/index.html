The digitalisation of society has not diluted the power of live performance, it has given it new relevance. <br>In this lecture, Professor David O’Donnell will examine the contribution of the theatre to the cultural capital of Aotearoa New Zealand. At its best, theatre is community-forming, uniting audiences in a shared experience of contemplating the crucial issues of the time. Most importantly, the theatre teaches us empathy, at a period in time where we need a sense of compassionate responsiveness more than ever before.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;

before<br>please join me in welcoming professor<br>takaka<br>thank you grant for your very generous<br>introduction<br>and uh thank you for giving me this pen<br>which i have to say perfectly matches<br>my tie tonight so i'll just put that<br>there and<br>make sure i don't forget it um<br>on this occasion i would really like to<br>acknowledge the mana<br>of the people who built the theater of<br>ulta aurora new zealand<br>particularly nola miller naio marsh<br>maria dronker richard campion don selwyn<br>nancy brunning and bruce mason whose<br>100th anniversary of his birth has been<br>celebrated this year<br>i also acknowledge and give my sincere<br>thanks to those<br>who have taught me particularly george<br>webby<br>rona bailey grant chile philip mann<br>david carnegie john downey<br>and runaway taylor i want to thank bill<br>walker for giving me my first directing<br>job<br>and lisa warrington for giving me a job<br>at the university of otago<br>and theater is always a team effort so i<br>also want to thank<br>and acknowledge my colleagues in the<br>theatre program<br>megan evans kathy mccullough laurie lay<br>nicola hyland<br>sarah thomason james manley paul tozer<br>and sam tiffan<br>and i thank all of the students that<br>i've taught over the years<br>from whom i've learned so much and i<br>also really want to thank my family<br>down here in the front row for their<br>love and support<br>throughout my entire career because<br>working in the theater is quite hard<br>it's quite time consuming<br>so your family does take a lot of that<br>on board so um what has<br>theater contributed to new zealand<br>culture<br>in march i went to auckland to see the<br>hakka party incident<br>a new verbatim play by katie wolfe<br>about the 1979 protest by ketawa<br>at a mock haka performed by university<br>of auckland engineering students<br>i've been looking forward to this play<br>for months because i have particular<br>interest in new zealand<br>history and verbatim theatre<br>but due to a covert 19 community case<br>sparking a level 3 lockdown on 28th of<br>february<br>many of the productions in the auckland<br>arts festival<br>including the hakka party incident were<br>postponed<br>so this was a chilling reminder not only<br>of the continuing presence of covert in<br>the community<br>but also of the crippling cost to our<br>performing artists<br>and arts organisations that rely on<br>social<br>interaction and face-to-face gatherings<br>for their very existence so<br>instead of seeing the hakka party<br>incident i went to<br>a play reading a stage reading at the<br>civic theatre<br>of nathan joe's scenes from a yellow<br>carol<br>now the orientalist architecture of the<br>civic<br>was a very ironic frame for this play<br>that aimed to question stereotypes of<br>east asian people<br>as quote demure soft spoken<br>and subservient so nathan joe and five<br>other actors perform poetic monologues<br>and dialogues<br>that raged at cultural appropriation<br>the colonial invasion of ontario the<br>stereotyping and homogenizing of<br>asians and racist violence at the climax<br>nathan joe says i'm sorry i couldn't<br>write a nice play<br>i'm sorry for opening old wounds but the<br>audience isn't sorrow<br>we spring to our feet in a long<br>sustained standing ovation<br>nathan joe challenges me to think about<br>white privilege<br>culture gender race and racism and<br>aotearoa<br>and he does it with poetic skill wit<br>charm and honesty switching between<br>anger<br>and vulnerability creating a tangible<br>emotional<br>empathetic response in the audience<br>so the hugger party incident went on to<br>be staged to rave reviews but i still<br>haven't seen it<br>so why am i talking about why i haven't<br>seen well i want to stress<br>this is the thing that makes theatre<br>special you have to be there<br>you have to be in town you have to be in<br>the room<br>so when theatre's really doing its job<br>audiences get this unique<br>one-off in-person experience an event<br>that<br>films and stream drama can't replace<br>so this evening i'm making a case for<br>the value of theatre in new zealand<br>society<br>theater goes far beyond providing<br>entertainment<br>to adding cultural economic social<br>educational<br>political value now i admit there is<br>some bad theatre<br>just as there are formulaic movies<br>tedious novels derivative paintings<br>leaky architecture but<br>at its best the community is the theater<br>is community forming<br>bringing people together for a shared<br>experience of thinking about<br>and talking about crucial issues of the<br>time<br>i've spent my adult life in theaters in<br>the audience<br>scribbling notes making shows<br>changing about shows reading about it<br>writing about it i became a kind of<br>eternal drama student<br>i learned acting at the new zealand<br>drama school did drama studies here at<br>victoria<br>and i did a masters in drama of otago<br>while some people dream of having a<br>night out<br>i dream of having a night in<br>but the players that have touched me<br>most have been those which have most<br>helped to make sense of my identity<br>as a parker new zealander and this has<br>not been an easy journey<br>inevitably this has been confronting<br>this country's troubled<br>history of colonization economic<br>disparity<br>racism sexism male violence the theater<br>is very good<br>at bringing these things to the surface<br>and making me feel both uncomfortable<br>and critical<br>but the theater is also very playful<br>people buy tricksters and shake shifters<br>full of wit irony and black humor<br>now i want to talk about the<br>relationship between<br>theaters across the globe stimulate<br>economic activity<br>especially in the hospitality retail and<br>transport industries<br>prior to the cloverd pandemic london's<br>west end theaters brought in<br>2.7 billion pounds annually<br>to the uk economy in 2008<br>theatre scholar dan rabalato calculated<br>the stage productions of andrew lloyd<br>webber's the phantom of the opera<br>had earned more than 5 billion us<br>dollars<br>at that time that was equivalent to the<br>total box office<br>of the four highest grossing movies of<br>all time<br>however money isn't everything<br>indeed parker's marching towards<br>bethlehem<br>a highly entertaining play about the<br>former prime minister robert muldoon<br>muldoon has a quiet moment with a taxi<br>driver and he says to the taxi driver<br>i'm just an accountant and then he<br>goes on to describe double entry<br>bookkeeping<br>as the sublimeous creation of a human<br>mind<br>now i love accountants as much as<br>anybody but i don't know<br>but i don't buy the idea that economics<br>will always be top<br>priority french philosopher pierre<br>bourdieu<br>explores the relationship between<br>economic capital and other forms of<br>capital<br>he stresses the value of cultural<br>capital which is the accumulation of<br>education<br>knowledge and social skills over time<br>geocritics economists<br>focus on money and profits stating<br>they are unaware that ability or talent<br>is itself the product of an investment<br>of time<br>and cultural capital and bulldoze<br>theories are particularly applicable to<br>theater<br>because he stresses that cultural<br>capital<br>is linked to the body and presupposes<br>embodiment theater is an embodied art<br>form the body<br>is at the center of it it said that the<br>performing arts are the only art form<br>where the artist and the artwork are the<br>so let's talk about investment and<br>cultural capital<br>in the 1950s and 60s there were heated<br>debates<br>about the pros and cons of setting up a<br>drama school<br>in new zealand at the time it was much<br>cheaper<br>to send talented young actors to train<br>at a drama school in england<br>the chair of the arts council the late<br>bill sheet<br>argued new zealand needed its own<br>drama school and i quote<br>it was misguided it was wrong<br>either they didn't come back which was a<br>big waste of time<br>or they would come back with a whole<br>series of attitudes which were totally<br>unrelated<br>to the realities of their own country it<br>is my strong belief<br>that the person who wishes to seek a<br>career in the performing arts<br>is as much entitled to be trained as<br>your lawyers<br>and school teachers thank you bill sheet<br>the establishment of the new zealand<br>drama school now toy fukari in 1970<br>was a leap of faith a belief that if you<br>train actors designers and technicians<br>they will grow the art form they will<br>create the industry and they have<br>in 2020 toyotari celebrated its 50th<br>anniversary<br>and its role caller graduates includes<br>many leaders<br>and artistic innovators in the creative<br>industries<br>the foundation of drama studies at<br>victoria by philip<br>mann up here in 1970<br>happened the same year and demonstrated<br>that drama was becoming a serious<br>subject of study<br>and a career option for our graduates<br>three years later<br>play market was established on robert<br>lord's bed in clifton terrace<br>by lord nanita reese judy russell and<br>ian fraser play market is a non-profit<br>playwrights agency<br>that also supports writers and promotes<br>their work<br>toy for curry clay market and university<br>drama studies<br>were game-changing investments in what<br>bourgeois would call the embodied<br>cultural capital<br>of aotearoa actors and writers are<br>trained to be astute observers of<br>society<br>and human behaviour play market<br>statistics show that 2020<br>88 of plays and professional theatres<br>were new zealand plays proof that new<br>zealanders want to see<br>theatre that reflects their own<br>experiences but the influence of new<br>zealand theatre goes<br>far beyond these shores this is the plot<br>for my colleagues look<br>james wedley's book is a fantastic book<br>uh ulta aurora new zealand and the<br>global marketplace<br>is a comprehensive study of new zealand<br>performers touring overseas from the<br>kiwi concert party of the 1940s to the<br>immersive<br>zombie apocalypse show the generation of<br>zed apocalypse<br>which played london for three months in<br>2015.<br>wendy suggests that theatre traveling<br>abroad has been a cultural connector<br>demonstrating the utopic potential of<br>theater to be a means for cross-cultural<br>fear people work really hard at least<br>six days a week morning afternoons and<br>nights<br>especially nights there's a very high<br>burnout rate in theatre<br>and once people reach a certain age and<br>want to settle down<br>the demands of low pay unstable<br>employment and unsociable hours make it<br>difficult<br>or impossible to continue but does it<br>always have to be that way<br>in a study of the adelaide french<br>festival sarah thomason<br>another colleague of mine argues that<br>many of the artists<br>effectively subsidize the festival<br>because they work for little or no money<br>noting that the adelaide festival<br>produces 77 million dollars<br>for businesses and local government in<br>adelaide<br>she questions quote the ethics and<br>sustainability<br>of a free market model that is<br>underwritten by the precarious and often<br>free labor<br>of performing of producing artists so is<br>it fair that everybody seems to be<br>making money<br>out of arts festivals apart from the<br>artists themselves<br>yet the economic contribution made by<br>performing artists is significant<br>and quantifiable according to the<br>ministry of culture and heritage<br>the performing arts contributed 2.3<br>billion dollars<br>or nearly one percent of gdp to the new<br>zealand economy in 2018.<br>contrast that 2.3 billion with the<br>incomes of artists<br>in 2019 creative new zealand research<br>found<br>the median personal annual income for<br>creative<br>professionals is 35 800<br>compared to 51 800 for all new<br>zealanders zooming away from salary<br>but that includes other sources of<br>income the median<br>income from creative work is only<br>fifteen thousand dollars<br>through dark comedy and performance poet<br>dominic chloe's recent show at bats<br>45 cents an hour which is roughly what<br>chloe earned from<br>writing rehearsing promoting and<br>performing his show<br>performing artists are experts at<br>creating empathy for others<br>maybe the time has come to have more<br>empathy for performing artists<br>but empathy has become such a political<br>buzzword at the moment<br>it's in danger of losing its meaning as<br>caroline heim writes empathy<br>is predominantly understood as the<br>process<br>of one person feeling into the emotional<br>states of another<br>performance theorists have looked to<br>science<br>to seek explanations of how mirror<br>neurons in the brain<br>explain how we are affected by the<br>emotional state<br>of characters on stage empathy<br>is relational it encourages<br>us to consider or reconsider our<br>relationships with others<br>empathy includes identification with<br>people who may be like me<br>but much more importantly it means being<br>able to identify with people<br>who are not like me to see things from a<br>different point of view<br>to feel a sense of understanding and<br>compassion for others<br>the film critic roger ebert wrote movies<br>are the most powerful<br>empathy machine in all the arts but for<br>me<br>there's nothing machine-like about the<br>process of improvising and live theatre<br>precisely because it is live i'm in the<br>same space i'm breathing the same air<br>as the performer as of nathan jones joe<br>scenes from a yellow peril the actors<br>bring their own personal life<br>experiences and cultures to their roles<br>their performances are invested with<br>their own passions and beliefs<br>and if it's a good performance i can't<br>help but get caught up in that<br>but why is empathy so important now<br>in recent years psychologists have<br>identified an<br>empathy deficit in society<br>donna moritini argues the isolated<br>non-social nature of internet activity<br>could contribute to a less empathetic<br>world<br>citing a 2010 study in the us that found<br>that<br>empathy among college students had<br>declined by 40 percent<br>between 1979 and 2009.<br>such studies empathic emphasize that<br>empathy is not<br>fixed that it can be acquired learned<br>and enhanced<br>attending theatre is an opposite<br>experience to digital<br>immersion and social media use you have<br>to leave the house<br>you have to meet up with others you have<br>to buy a ticket watching a show with<br>real people in it<br>talk to real people about the show<br>afterwards it's a profoundly active<br>social experience<br>the social engagement fostered by<br>theater encourages human interaction<br>counters empathy deficit and builds on<br>the empathetic responses created by the<br>performance itself<br>since the 1970s maori and pacific<br>playwrights have used the stage<br>as a place to raise awareness and<br>empathy for those most<br>affected by the colonial legacy of<br>aotearoa<br>1972 the feathers of the albatross by<br>harry dansy<br>who went on to become new zealand's<br>second race relations conciliator<br>commissioned by the altman arts festival<br>educated aucklanders about the history<br>of maori resistance in taranaki<br>during the land wars and the passive<br>resistance strategies of tiffity and<br>tohu<br>at parihaka in the spectacular<br>production mounted at saint mary's<br>cathedral<br>to fiti addresses the people of panipaka<br>and i'm just going to read a short quote<br>from this<br>in the days before i was taken from you<br>before togu was taken from you<br>i spoke of peace when i was taken<br>i spoke at peace and now when i return<br>i speak again of peace you have suffered<br>and i have suffered but we have kept the<br>peace<br>this is a beautiful play that<br>beautifully captures the mana and<br>dignity of maori leadership<br>in the face of colonisation and this<br>play paved the way for many maori<br>playwrights to come<br>in the last decades of the 20th century<br>maori artists made sure<br>that theater became a public space where<br>torreira could be spoken<br>where audiences could appreciate the<br>value of preserving alta rosa's<br>indigenous language and this is one of<br>the reasons why<br>romaportichi wrote in 1991 in their work<br>maori playwrights reassert the mana of<br>in action and i want to give a<br>fascinating case history<br>of maori self-determination<br>uh takithua productions began in<br>wellington in 1983 as the depot<br>a pacquiao run theater dedicated to<br>presenting only new zealand work<br>in 1991 it changed the same to take<br>depot adopting a bicultural kaupapa that<br>place equal weight on maori and pakia<br>values<br>in 1993 the depot was dropped from the<br>name signifying that takirua was now a<br>fully indigenous company<br>and by 1997 it had become a maori led<br>nationwide touring theatre company so<br>the evolution<br>of takilua like the foundation of kuda<br>kopapa and kohanga<br>at the same time is a potent example of<br>transformational governance<br>that provides a template for maori<br>taking control of strategic<br>organizations<br>and moving towards hopefully a more<br>equitable<br>decolonized society and<br>this is quite incredible i mean i won't<br>put this up alongside the stats i showed<br>earlier about how much money<br>the theater puts into economies in<br>britain and here<br>ever since 1995 takirua has toured a<br>play<br>in toro around new zealand performing to<br>young audiences in schools<br>marae and isolated communities in the<br>last 10 years alone<br>takerua had performed nearly 1 000 shows<br>of torreira plays to audiences totaling<br>130 000<br>176 so how can we assess the cultural<br>capital<br>generated by these performances it's not<br>about money<br>it's impossible to quantify the benefits<br>of young people experiencing plays<br>in their indigenous language but<br>takedown's archives are filled<br>with feedback forms in english antero<br>from children expressing their deep<br>appreciation of these plays<br>takiru's terrell performances are<br>an example of a considerable cultural<br>capital<br>generated by just one performing arts<br>company<br>and in wellington at this very moment we<br>have a potent example of tino<br>rangatiratanga in<br>action in kiamo a festival of maori<br>pacifica and global indigenous<br>performance<br>with 22 shows and writers festival<br>spread across all of wellington's<br>now yesterday the government<br>announced there will be a formal apology<br>to the pacific<br>community for the dawn raids of the<br>1970s<br>but 24 years ago a play about the race<br>was produced by pacific underground<br>a theater and music company founded in<br>christchurch in 1992<br>by young pacifica artists in 1997<br>oscar kaibi's play dawn raids helped<br>audiences of all cultures<br>to empathize with pacific communities as<br>they reenacted the trauma of the raids<br>the play shows the samoan family living<br>in fear<br>as they hide their son sione's pregnant<br>fiancee<br>rossa in their house at the end of the<br>play the house is raided by the police<br>before rossa is arrested and deported to<br>someone<br>her conviction means she won't be able<br>to return to new zealand<br>and sione has no money to go to samoa<br>so it's clear their child will grow up<br>without a father<br>and this year to acknowledge the 50th<br>anniversary of the polynesian panthers<br>our first year theatre students study<br>dawn rays<br>for many of them this opened up a period<br>of new zealand history<br>they knew nothing about this play<br>creates<br>a critical empathy a concern for others<br>and a desire to make change<br>and albert wentz play the song maker's<br>chair<br>his main character the patriarch of the<br>samoan family describes aotearoa as<br>quote a country that has not been kind<br>and generous to us<br>and the suffering experienced by some<br>migrant families in aotearoa<br>is powerfully revealed in a boy called<br>piano<br>a production by the koch based on the<br>experiences of<br>lofutu<br>in the 1960s this play premiered at bats<br>and was recently broadcast on radio new<br>zealand<br>similar stories are being told every day<br>in the current royal commission of<br>abuse and state care but a boy called<br>piano<br>translates this into art that<br>lifts us up rather than bringing us down<br>in the play we witnessed the abuse<br>experienced by the main character piano<br>and his two<br>maori friends and various state<br>institutions<br>although the boys are played by adult<br>actors we're constantly reminded they're<br>only 11 years old<br>their close friendship brings some<br>humour and likeness to the narrative<br>piano was named after his mother's piano<br>the memory of which is represented on<br>stage<br>by a grand piano played by mark vanilla<br>who creates theatrical magic with his<br>delicate interpretations of traditional<br>and contemporary music from the pacific<br>the beauty of the music provides a<br>balance to the violence of piano's story<br>and helps to sustain a possibility for<br>contemporary theater artists have<br>responded to digital isolation and<br>empathy deficit<br>by enhancing the liveness of theater<br>through immersive theatre techniques and<br>incorporating digital technology<br>yes yes yes by elena bishop and karen<br>mccracken<br>is a play for teenagers exploring issues<br>of consent and healthy sexual<br>relationships<br>as the audience enters the actor karen<br>mccracken sets up the space<br>chats the people making them feel at<br>ease setting up an atmosphere of trust<br>she asks for volunteers from the<br>audience to play several of the<br>characters<br>and telling a story of sexual abuse at a<br>party<br>the characters are given<br>non-gender-specific names<br>to avoid stereotyping and to make the<br>experience relevant to all<br>the volunteers come up on stage and read<br>from scripts<br>they're asked to read mutually without<br>trying to act the characters<br>and when i saw the performance all the<br>volunteers were young women<br>their unrehearsed performances were<br>extremely<br>moving with a degree of spontaneity and<br>realness<br>it was really different from polish<br>performances by actors<br>and prior to the performance we were<br>invited to upload a web link onto our<br>phones<br>at specific moments in the show we<br>typed in comments about how we felt<br>about what we were seeing<br>as people typed on their phones their<br>comments were projected live<br>on screen i want to have a cry<br>i'm feeling like i want to get better<br>about talking about this<br>it's important to be educated about what<br>to say<br>where did our ideas about romance come<br>from<br>yes yes yes heightens the likeness of<br>the audience experience<br>and including audience reactions and the<br>performance itself<br>really works in increasing awareness and<br>understanding<br>of the issue of consent there's a really<br>powerful sense of community<br>in the theatre a sense of shared mission<br>and despite the distressing subject<br>matter the tone in the play<br>is often light and humorous and the<br>conclusion is actually joyful<br>and positive yes yes yes creates a<br>critical empathy<br>because it acknowledges a social problem<br>takes an ethical position<br>educates us about respect and healthy<br>relationships<br>and encourages us to take that out of<br>i'm just going to talk a little bit now<br>about some of my own creative practice<br>in which i've been drawn to work that<br>creates uh cultural capital<br>as well as economic capital in 1986<br>i helped to contribute to the economic<br>capital of the wairarapa<br>when i directed this musical rogers<br>uh six nights in the old greytown town<br>hall were completely sold out<br>but did footrot flats contribute<br>anything to the cultural capital of the<br>community<br>living behind the cartoony<br>characterizations of the one-liners was<br>a simple message<br>the farmer and the townie should be<br>friends still rather<br>today in 1981 shortly after graduating<br>from drama school<br>i acted in a roger hall comedy 5050<br>it was a great thrill to be acting<br>alongside two consummate actors helen<br>mulder and ray henwood<br>the play was set and margaret thatcher's<br>britain<br>ray played george who has been made<br>redundant<br>from his job as an insurance clerk at<br>age 54.<br>i played his son michael who after<br>completing a phd on a very obscure<br>novelist is also unemployed<br>5050 is a comedy but that contains a<br>warning<br>about the social cost of<br>intergenerational unemployment<br>and at the time i played this role i had<br>absolutely no idea<br>that the election of the fourth labour<br>government in new zealand three years<br>later<br>would instigate thatcher-style free<br>market reforms<br>here leading to similar levels of<br>restructuring and unemployment<br>looking back at 50 50 today bull's place<br>seems president and<br>anticipating the social impact of<br>neo-liberal reforms<br>that swept the globe in the 1980s and is<br>still with us today<br>1981 was also the year of the springbok<br>rugby tour<br>that traumatized and divided the nation<br>we at the downstage theatre company were<br>told<br>that when we went on the anti-tour<br>protests we had to a<br>not get injured and b not get arrested<br>because we had to be in the theater by 7<br>25 pm<br>some years later my experiences in 1981<br>fed into the process<br>of directing albert beltz's play to<br>karakia<br>a play set during the springbok tour<br>now one of the most satisfying aspects<br>of my directing career<br>has been working on new scripts a new<br>play<br>is a fragile thing a template for a<br>future production<br>that exists at first only on the<br>playwright's imagination<br>then it gets on the page then it becomes<br>a team effort<br>a creative community gathers around this<br>writing<br>a dramaturg which is a fancy name for a<br>script advisor<br>designers actors stage manager director<br>slowly the production becomes tangible<br>images<br>form timber and canvas<br>light and sound flesh and blood<br>the empathy and listening skills the<br>artists bring to this collaboration<br>has the same quality as the empathy and<br>listening<br>you hope the audience will bring with<br>this fragile thing<br>this new performance work finds its way<br>into the magical space of the theater<br>at the heart of takarakia is a love<br>story<br>between irania and matt<br>childhood friends who we see singing<br>and playing together at the school bus<br>the adult actors playing children<br>immediately engage the empathy of the<br>audience setting the scene<br>for what is to come rania and matt<br>meet years later in auckland in 1981<br>where rania is a photographer involved<br>with the anti-tour protests<br>sparks fly they become lovers<br>although rania notices that matt is very<br>uneasy<br>socialising with her protester friends<br>finally to irania's horror<br>matt reveals that he is a policeman<br>and not only that he's a member of the<br>elite riot police unit known as the red<br>squad<br>after the hamilton test match is called<br>off following protesters invading the<br>field<br>they see some hope that matt might leave<br>the place and that rania and matt can be<br>reconciled<br>but he chooses the police force over<br>love<br>a simple reading of this plot could see<br>it as a metaphor<br>for race relations in new zealand a<br>bicultural romance<br>plagued by different world views and<br>doomed failure<br>albert belts complicates the scenario<br>and that was brought up in the rigorous<br>discipline<br>of the exclusive brethren church rania's<br>touring<br>is<br>worked for his whole life and the hope<br>of buying back<br>his whanau's ancestral land from matt's<br>family<br>both rania and matt are empathetic<br>characters there's this romeo and juliet<br>like hope<br>of a happy ending but it's endlessly<br>frustrated<br>by the larger socio-political context<br>matt referring to his police uniform<br>says<br>these are my clothes now this is my<br>warmth<br>this is what i choose rania replies<br>then should we face each other in new<br>plymouth<br>christchurch eden park would you arrest<br>me<br>would you arrest anyone in this room<br>matt says<br>i will do what needs to be done<br>if the audience ends up feeling for<br>these characters<br>they must be aware that rania and matt<br>are caught up in historical factors<br>beyond their control and to cope here<br>albert belt skillfully weaves weaves<br>together all these disparate elements<br>the political division<br>sparked by the springbok tour the legacy<br>of fundamentalism<br>the struggle for maori land rights the<br>global fight<br>against racism the same year i worked on<br>takarakia<br>i worked on another new play this one<br>was set in the eternal night<br>of an antarctic winter heat<br>was first performed at bats in 2008<br>then in 2010 the production toured<br>nationwide<br>entirely powered off-grid by four solar<br>panels<br>and a wooden turbine mounted on a<br>shipping container<br>through the framing device of a love<br>triangle between a woman<br>a man and a penguin the play dealt with<br>ecological things<br>specifically the impact of climate<br>change on the natural environment<br>the alternative power setup was designed<br>both to echo the themes of the play<br>and to model eco-friendly technology<br>that could help reduce the carbon<br>footprint of theater production<br>heat begins with a scientist couple<br>stella and john preparing for winter<br>over in a plywood hut<br>lashed to an ice shelf as the antarctic<br>winter sets in<br>the couple's relationship comes under<br>extreme stress<br>and when a sick emperor penguin<br>nicknamed bob<br>joins him in the heart tensions spill<br>over<br>now linda specified that bob be played<br>by a completely naked<br>body painted actor two<br>beret ray backers played this role<br>requiring over one hour of makeup prior<br>to the show<br>and a very high degree of physical<br>expertise<br>to portray a penguin realistically bob<br>never spoke<br>expressing himself only through movement<br>and his nakedness produced<br>a tangible sense that there was an<br>animal in the room<br>in both productions the portrayal of bob<br>is highly successful generating<br>very high degrees of empathy in the<br>audience<br>because bob is such an engaging<br>character when he dies at the end and<br>stella's arms<br>were left with this great sense of loss<br>he was one of three plays in linda<br>chiang mai girl's antarctic trilogy<br>and last year i directed the development<br>season on the second play<br>hole set in the 1980s when scientists<br>discovered a hole in the ozone layer<br>the relationship between stella an<br>atmospheric chemist<br>and bonnie leader of the green priest's<br>protest camp<br>symbolizes the relationship between<br>science and political activism<br>that led to the signing of the montreal<br>protocol in 1989<br>an international treaty designed to<br>limit the depletion of the ozone wire<br>later by the way the full production of<br>paul will be staged<br>at circa later this year with a<br>different director<br>linda chiang mai oil makes the most of<br>the visceral nature<br>of live performance to engage audiences<br>emotionally and intellectually<br>challenging us who empathize<br>with the fragility of the environment<br>itself<br>empathy is not an end in itself it can<br>be the beginning of new relationships<br>deeper understanding a more balanced way<br>of viewing society and culture<br>or of solving problems theatre can<br>create a critical empathy where we feel<br>and identify<br>but also critique and question<br>wellington's barbarian productions<br>responded to the 250th anniversary of<br>captain cook's arrival in new zealand<br>by producing cook thinks again<br>written by joe ranson and tom clark<br>plays a clown version of cook in his<br>trademark white wig<br>tricorn hat and blue uniform cook slash<br>clark<br>takes us on a walking tour from te alo<br>park<br>to the museum of wellington taking in<br>sites such as the remnants of<br>the fliniwaka the grove of karaka trees<br>and the kupe statue<br>in this performance the whole of<br>wellington harbour<br>becomes a magnificent theater<br>with all of its symbolism i can't help<br>but think of the arrival of kupe<br>the paths that line the harbour before<br>the colonial forces<br>arrived as a comic caricature of cook<br>clark plants small union jacks on<br>everything<br>he wants to colonize and he names<br>everybody in the audience<br>john because it's much easier to use<br>names you already know rather than<br>bothering with finding out what people's<br>names really are<br>as cook reflects on his legacy he begins<br>to have doubts<br>about the justice of the colonial<br>project he says<br>i've had 240 years to think about it<br>since i was killed on valentine's day in<br>hawaii<br>and since then i've been trying to<br>reconsider my actions<br>because that wasn't the best way to go<br>hatch the pieces<br>i had blood running out from everywhere<br>and i'm thinking what did i do<br>as he contemplates his legacy cook<br>begins to<br>think again discovering some empathy<br>for the indigenous peoples of the<br>pacific he says<br>the racist thinking i was part of has to<br>change<br>these hierarchical ways of thinking<br>they have to go and you<br>it's a very breathtaking ending by the<br>way uh court thanks again<br>concludes with an audience discussion<br>with tom clark over a cup of tea at<br>museum<br>surrounded by artifacts of wellington's<br>colonial history at the performance i<br>attended<br>the discussion revealed that the<br>participants learned a huge amount about<br>new zealand history<br>immediately walked past the arrow site<br>without even noticing it<br>so the ironic humour in this production<br>successfully opened the pathway<br>for challenging conversations on the<br>this play takes a different stance on<br>empathy<br>which a transmission by stewart mckenzie<br>examines the new zealand government's<br>approach to the covert 19th pandemic<br>the script was created by editing<br>verbatim transcripts of interviews<br>with prime minister jacinda adam deputy<br>prime minister grant robertson<br>and epidemiologist dr michael michael<br>baker<br>who are the main characters in the play<br>the play delves into the psyches of the<br>politicians<br>who made such momentous decisions last<br>year under extreme pressure to protect<br>public health and reveals their humanity<br>in compelling ways<br>ardern and robinson are portrayed as<br>empathetic individuals<br>committed to principles of well-being<br>and kindness<br>yet there's a dramatically effective<br>tension between their empathy<br>and the urgency of making unprecedented<br>decisions<br>that will negatively impact on the<br>well-being and livelihoods<br>of new zealanders a reporter may hera<br>expresses unease at the widespread<br>adulation of ardern<br>and ashley bloomfield when she states to<br>think that the gold standard of ethics<br>is dangerous<br>yet the verbatim script gives us access<br>into the motivations of politicians<br>to see them as vulnerable identifiable<br>living breathing people rather than<br>media bites<br>or distant figureheads so transmission<br>opens up crucial questions<br>in this moment of global crisis what<br>role should empathy play<br>in leadership how real is the empathy<br>expressed by politicians<br>can empathy be sustained under political<br>pressure<br>i hope that my examples tonight have<br>proved to you<br>beyond out that theater people have made<br>a magnificent lasting contribution to<br>new zealand culture<br>theatre has represented the diversity of<br>cultures and languages in new zealand<br>theatre is reflected and in some cases<br>anticipated<br>theatrical representation is fine art<br>and leaves behind it<br>it's actual presence no trace<br>no object to carry off it is neither a<br>book<br>nor a work but an energy<br>and in this sense it is the only art of<br>life<br>now we don't memorialize our theater<br>history<br>and large public buildings like we do<br>with the visual arts<br>so how do we remember it learn from it<br>draw inspiration from it when the<br>theaters closed due to covert<br>every theater technician left a ghost<br>light<br>burning in the darkened auditorium<br>garage project even produced a ghostlike<br>beer to support theaters<br>after the lockdown theater people<br>are obsessed by ghosts because theaters<br>are filled<br>with the ghosts of past performances<br>because fear is an illusion that exists<br>only briefly then it is gone<br>it is as dari now suggests the art form<br>most like life itself<br>fear has been a place where we have<br>imagined and dreamed together<br>theater has been a place for reflecting<br>on our postcolonial history<br>theatre has contributed to the health<br>and well-being<br>of everyone in ulta aurora theater has<br>been my classroom<br>my history book my philosophy lesson<br>my spiritual guide kia ora thank you for<br>listening<br>david<br>good evening i'm professor sarah leggett<br>i'm the dean of the faculty of<br>humanities and social sciences<br>tewahanga and it's my privilege this<br>evening<br>to offer the vote of thanks on behalf of<br>us all<br>to professor david o'donnell for his<br>powerful inaugural lecture<br>as professor of theater at te<br>harengawaka<br>victoria university of wellington<br>professor david o'donnell is recognized<br>nationally and internationally<br>as both a leading theatre director and a<br>preeminent scholar of theatre studies<br>and his inaugural this evening has<br>confirmed without doubt<br>that this high reputation is thoroughly<br>deserved<br>david's lecture has provided a space for<br>us to pause<br>and reflect on the multiple<br>contributions that theatre makes<br>to our society and culture it has<br>challenged us<br>to address the conditions faced by our<br>performing artists and others in the<br>sector<br>and it has illuminated the power of the<br>theater to help us confront some of the<br>more negative aspects of our country's<br>history<br>from economic disparity to sexism<br>male violence racism and the colonial<br>legacy<br>of oppression and disadvantage<br>this evening david has taken us on a<br>fascinating journey<br>through multiple aspects of new<br>zealand's theatrical history<br>from the establishment of the new<br>zealand drama school in 1970<br>now tu followed by the opening of play<br>market<br>both described by david as game-changing<br>investments<br>in the cultural capital of aotearoa<br>signaling<br>a tribute to the vision and enduring<br>legacy<br>of those who spearheaded those<br>initiatives and through to the<br>contemporary leadership<br>and impact of the takirua theatre<br>company<br>through examples from productions by<br>playwrights ranging from roger hall and<br>albert wendt<br>to oscar kitely and joe anderson through<br>to contemporary figures such as nathan<br>joe and eleanor bishop among others<br>david<br>has highlighted for us the immense<br>contribution that theatre<br>has made and continues to make to new<br>zealand culture<br>and this brings us to the central tenet<br>of david's beautifully presented<br>inaugural<br>that theatre is a highly influential<br>form of entertainment<br>but that its value extends well beyond<br>that<br>david makes a compelling case for the<br>economic<br>social educational educational cultural<br>and political value of theatre<br>challenging us<br>as a society to acknowledge and<br>appropriately<br>reward the significant economic capital<br>created by the performing arts sector<br>this is a sector<br>under intense pressure with david's<br>lecture highlighting the financial and<br>workload pressures<br>faced by our performing artists together<br>with significant concerns<br>about the well-being and mental health<br>of actors<br>and other workers in the stage and<br>screen industries<br>david also makes a compelling case for<br>the role that theater can play<br>in helping us make sense of our identity<br>as individuals and as a society<br>in challenging us to think about such<br>confronting issues<br>in the history and present of ayatiro in<br>new zealand<br>as domestic violence ingrained privilege<br>abuse and state care sexual consent<br>and the multiple impacts of the colonial<br>legacy<br>racism dawn raids loss of land loss of<br>the right to use te reo maori<br>david signals here the particular power<br>of indigenous theatre<br>and its potential to raise awareness of<br>past<br>and ongoing inequality and to serve as<br>an enabler of decolonization<br>these are difficult issues but important<br>ones<br>posing questions that we as a society<br>need to ask ourselves<br>and good theatre can reveal probe and<br>examine<br>aspects of these complex issues with wit<br>and humor<br>and most importantly david argues<br>in a way that generates empathy helping<br>us to identify with different people<br>and their experiences to feel compassion<br>for others<br>in contemporary society where we suffer<br>from the identified empathy deficit<br>this ability to foster social engagement<br>and human interaction<br>is absolutely critical so<br>thank you david for a powerful and very<br>personal<br>inaugural lecture we're enormously<br>appreciative<br>and i think we'll all leave this evening<br>with a strong appreciation<br>of the enormous contributions that<br>theatre makes to the society<br>and culture of our tierra in new zealand<br>with a greater awareness of the power of<br>the theater to generate<br>empathy and reminded of the cultural<br>and economic capital generated by the<br>performing arts sector<br>writ large finally<br>i think we'll also leave this evening<br>reminded that we are extremely fortunate<br>to have david o'donnell<br>actor director and theater scholar<br>here as professor of theater at<br>tehengawaka victoria university<br>of wellington david is as many people in<br>this room tonight can attest<br>an
