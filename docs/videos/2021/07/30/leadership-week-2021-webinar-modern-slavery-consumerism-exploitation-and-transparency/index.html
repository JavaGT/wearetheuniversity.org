This institutionalised and systemic slavery is happening all around us, but often just out of sight, and most of us are unaware of its magnitude and gravity. People can become entrapped making our clothes, serving our food, picking our crops, working in factories, or working in households as cooks, cleaners, or nannies.

thanks<br>becky<br>thank you so much james for the kind<br>introduction i'm just going to share my<br>screen so<br>right right so we<br>should be good to go and um yeah just to<br>echo again the comments that have<br>already been said thank you so much for<br>inviting myself and world vision to<br>to share this evening and thank you to<br>all those that are<br>engaging with this and giving up your<br>time to to watch the panel and engage<br>with the panel<br>i think it's really important this issue<br>obviously and so<br>it's actually encouraging to see how<br>much interest there is in modern slavery<br>and<br>i hope that tonight's session is<br>informative and and yeah that will<br>continue to sort of grow your interest<br>in<br>in this space so i've got the the tricky<br>task i guess of laying the foundation<br>for the night of what is modern slavery<br>what do we mean when we use this<br>terminology and<br>actually what needs to be done um to to<br>counteract this and<br>and to address modern slavery um i guess<br>i just want to unpack very quickly a<br>little bit of my background so um<br>my background was as a new zealand<br>lawyer i worked for a number of years in<br>the uk<br>representing survivors of one slavery<br>and human trafficking and<br>um after that i moved into the policy<br>space and i'll be honest it's you know<br>actually seeing you know firsthand what<br>survivors have gone through and and the<br>deep-rooted issues that are in our<br>communities and our society it's given<br>me a huge passion for this<br>um and i'm really happy to be able to be<br>working with world vision and to sort of<br>be working on this in the space in new<br>zealand because actually this is a lot<br>more connected to new zealand<br>and then perhaps we realized so<br>um moving straight into it when you hear<br>the term modern slavery<br>um you'll probably find that there are a<br>lot of terminology that's thrown around<br>and it can be really confusing when it<br>comes to definitions<br>and you know in general there isn't sort<br>of like a formal global<br>legal definition of one slavery but<br>there's a sort of general understanding<br>and different jurisdictions also have<br>within the domestic law<br>kind of fleshed out what modern slavery<br>means but i think here a really good<br>kind of<br>succinct um definition that we could use<br>is the severe exploitation of people for<br>personal or commercial gain<br>and along the on the slide here you see<br>i've listed a whole number of um<br>i guess forms of exploitation that often<br>fall or are categorized within modern<br>slavery so we've got human trafficking<br>forced labor the slavery of children<br>forced in early marriage<br>organ harvesting forced criminality we<br>don't have time to go through<br>each of these different um headings and<br>definitions tonight actually you could<br>do a massive seminar on each on each one<br>and um i guess i just don't want to to<br>paint the picture that this can easily<br>be packaged into one term<br>it's not it's complicated and it can<br>look really different in different<br>contexts<br>but we'll have a crack at kind of just<br>laying a bit of foundation<br>um so one term that i did want to pick<br>out a little bit is because you'll hear<br>it a lot<br>is the term of human trafficking so this<br>is something that's generally accepted<br>to fall within<br>um the terminology of modern slavery and<br>i've got here the definition from the<br>palmeiro protocol<br>and but i've broken that down into sort<br>of more it's a really mouthy wordy<br>definition if you have a crack it's<br>saying that quickly you'll find you get<br>lost very<br>very quickly but if you sort of draw out<br>the key concepts as you can see here on<br>the right we've got three main elements<br>we've got act which is the movement<br>recruitment transportation<br>of persons we've got the means which is<br>the control<br>so threat use of force deception abuse<br>of power or vulnerability<br>and we've got purpose so the<br>exploitation of that person and that<br>exploitation can take a number of forms<br>that could be sexual exploitation that<br>could be forced labor that could be<br>domestic service and so<br>that kind of can help you think about<br>these three elements a couple of um<br>i guess myth-busting things here so for<br>trafficking to have taken place that<br>doesn't need to have been the crossing<br>of an international border<br>that can happen within a domestic<br>framework it can just be the movement of<br>somebody from one place to another<br>and um i think also important to note as<br>well that actually for someone to be<br>classified as a victim or survivor of<br>human trafficking the exploitation<br>doesn't need to have actually taken<br>place<br>and they just had to have been the actor<br>means element for the purpose of that<br>expectation has to be found<br>and the last thing to remember as well<br>that for a child um<br>child trafficking doesn't need that<br>means element just the movement for the<br>exploitation<br>that doesn't need to have been that<br>control or deceit for that threshold of<br>trafficking to have been met<br>the other one i wanted to pull out<br>because you'll hear it a lot and i'm<br>sure it will come up be quite i think<br>the sort of<br>main type of exploitation that we're<br>talking about but in the context of this<br>webinar and that is forced labor<br>so the un convention converting force to<br>compulsory labor defines forced labor as<br>all work or service which is exactly<br>from any person under the menace of any<br>penalty for which the said person has<br>not offered himself voluntarily<br>and i've done the same thing here and<br>i've tried to break that definition down<br>a little bit into like a more<br>easy to understand um i guess yeah<br>breakdown of concept<br>so i think i've got here the means so<br>that's the threat of the penalty<br>and um you know again that deception or<br>that abuse of power of vulnerability and<br>then we've got the service so that can<br>be<br>i guess the the the type of exploitation<br>or the means an individual provides a<br>service for the benefit of somebody else<br>um so here it could be manual labor it<br>could be begging it could be sexual<br>services<br>it could be domestic service they could<br>all fall under forced labor<br>um i think also important to note that<br>penalty and that word could be very<br>like blatantly obvious you know that<br>somebody is threatened they have to do<br>something and there's a really you know<br>a threat of physical violence but often<br>it takes a lot more subtle forms in a<br>way that somebody<br>is that means element is met and it<br>could be the deception so obviously<br>lying about what's taking place and that<br>abuse of vulnerability<br>again so knowing that that person has no<br>other option and meaning that they're<br>sort of forced<br>to to consent to this activity because<br>there's no alternative<br>and it can be also psychological in<br>nature like threatening to turn that<br>person over to authorities<br>often there can be an abuse of someone's<br>immigration or lack of immigration<br>status<br>um or you know threat of turning them<br>over to the police which means there's<br>that control<br>and the person feels they have to stay<br>in that situation that they can't escape<br>it<br>again for children only the service<br>element needs to take place so for a<br>child to be a victim of forced labor<br>there doesn't need to be that that means<br>element<br>so um modern slavery i'm sure many of<br>you are aware<br>actually this is you know this is a<br>pressing issue all the time in fact i<br>would challenge and say it's the<br>pressing issue of our time<br>there are thought to be 40 million<br>people estimated to be trapped in one<br>slavery worldwide which is a really<br>scary stat right like<br>i think often we see that state and we<br>just get lost we're like it's so big<br>what can we do<br>i mean we'll get to that there's a lot<br>that new zealand can and should be doing<br>and we're you know we're behind our game<br>but you know i'm sure we'll get more<br>into those details<br>71 are women and girls and one in four<br>victims are thought to be<br>a child and um this does connect close<br>to home and<br>earlier this year world vision has<br>released research um<br>and we found that 3.1 billion of risky<br>products were imported into new zealand<br>in 2019<br>by risky product i mean a product that<br>given the<br>context with their product was produced<br>and the supply chains associated to it<br>there was a high risk it was produced in<br>the context of one slavery and we also<br>found that<br>on average 34 each week is spent by the<br>average kiwi household<br>on on risky products so actually this is<br>you know<br>as much as we also have issues of<br>domestic slavery within our country<br>the exploitation of people happening on<br>new zealand's shores<br>it's in our everyday household goods and<br>items and so it's something we all<br>should be alive to<br>and it's something we should all be<br>doing something about it's not<br>acceptable<br>for this to be an issue of our society<br>um so how do we deal with this obviously<br>i've just presented a huge problem<br>and actually i'm pleased to say i really<br>do believe there are solutions and there<br>are things that we need to be doing<br>however i actually believe a holistic<br>approach is what's needed to end slavery<br>there's not one<br>tick box exercise that's going to get<br>this you know um<br>to be made history in our time and<br>actually we need to be working together<br>across industries and with communities<br>and i've just listed i guess some of the<br>ways which we can address this one of<br>this is actually by recognizing and<br>addressing push factors<br>that um cause people to be vulnerable to<br>mon slavery in the first place<br>here i've listed some so poverty it's<br>like your inability to meet your basic<br>need<br>discrimination we saw just before in the<br>state that women and children uh<br>you know the majority of people in these<br>situations of exploitation<br>immigration status they talked about<br>that psychological control but also it<br>can happen as well to kiwi nationals and<br>nationals of the country<br>as well so it's not just a migrant issue<br>lack of access to education and work<br>lack of access to rights so that's<br>access to injustice to justice access to<br>employment rights<br>um are really important in terms of<br>addressing the actual causing factors of<br>modern slavery the protection and rights<br>of survivors<br>are extremely important making sure that<br>survivors are identified and also that<br>they can access support and protection<br>and access to remedy<br>also some people are confident to come<br>forward and report when this happens to<br>them<br>supply chain due diligence so working<br>with corporate and the public sector<br>and i know many of my fantastic<br>colleagues on this call are going to<br>dive into this more what these models<br>look like and how they are effective and<br>what the impact of them are<br>and also i put her criminal and civil<br>justice so we're talking here about<br>making sure that there's um<br>both criminal and civil penalty<br>penalties here and able to get<br>restitution<br>um for when this happens um i think<br>that's all i've got time for i'm going<br>to wrap up soon i guess i just want to<br>say from world vision's perspective<br>you know we are really passionate about<br>the work that needs to be done here<br>within new zealand in the pacific region<br>and wider at the side of the world<br>we see that as both the new zealand<br>government bringing in effective<br>legislation<br>we support that and we are pushing for<br>that and we also see that in our<br>programmatic work on the ground with<br>communities where we're trying to<br>address some of these push factors that<br>make people vulnerable to exploitation<br>so that especially for children there is<br>another route that children are able to<br>stay in education and access when<br>they're older appropriate and<br>sustainable work that's good for their<br>families and communities<br>that they're not going to be exploited i<br>just left here my contact details um in<br>case you're you know interested in what<br>world vision are doing in the space and<br>have any questions we can't address in<br>the session<br>but thank you so much and i'll hand over<br>thank you becky and we will circulate<br>those those slides uh elise gordon over<br>thanks james and thank you to<br>transparency international<br>and the brian piccott chair of ethical<br>leadership for having me<br>the aussie ring in on the call so i<br>appreciate it<br>i'm just gonna quickly share my screen<br>yes we can thanks<br>okay so um in terms of our region<br>um and what modern slavery looks like i<br>am<br>i just wanted to mention that you know<br>modern slavery happens in all countries<br>in the world uh and and the countries of<br>the pacific<br>region in our region um are no exception<br>so walk free in our 2018<br>global slavery index report estimated<br>that<br>in australia there were some 15 000<br>people<br>in modern slavery some form of bond<br>slavery on any given day<br>in 2016 and in that same period we<br>estimated that in new zealand there were<br>around three thousand people in some<br>form of modern slavery<br>we don't have estimates for the extent<br>of modern slavery<br>in um the south pacific islands and<br>territories unfortunately<br>as yet um but we do know that it exists<br>and so i really wanted to sort of break<br>that that number<br>well maybe put put some faces to those<br>numbers so what does<br>what do these numbers actually look like<br>at practice um so you may be aware<br>of the um the recent case of modern<br>slavery<br>in new zealand um where the samoan chief<br>joseph orga matamata was um convicted of<br>slavery and trafficking offences<br>um and he was he was jailed for 11 years<br>for those<br>those offences now this was a really<br>horrible case it<br>involves um the exploitation of 13<br>samoans<br>one as young as 12 years of age um it<br>happened the exploitation happened over<br>the course of 25 years<br>um and i think what i really wanted to<br>point out was that some of the elements<br>of this case<br>um are really common across many<br>of the modern slavery experiences in our<br>region so there's deception<br>so the victims were um<br>were told that they would have<br>legitimate work in new zealand<br>and would be paid a fair price and<br>instead they were<br>made to work long hours their pay was<br>withheld their movement was restricted<br>and heavily monitored<br>they weren't able to contact their<br>families at home and there was<br>verbal and physical abuse as well if<br>they weren't working hard enough<br>um and we know that this is just the tip<br>of the iceberg<br>so um majority of cases go undetected we<br>let along going to trial or ending in a<br>conviction or any kind of justice for<br>the victims sadly<br>um so so uh<br>wilfred did some research in 2019 and<br>trying to better understand what modern<br>slavery looks like<br>in the pacific region and what we found<br>with that<br>most forms of modern slavery were<br>reported across the region<br>so for example we identified<br>forced labor in the construction<br>horticulture<br>fishing and agricultural sectors for<br>for example a given example from fiji um<br>filipino workers had been reported to be<br>in forced labor in the construction<br>industry over there debt bondage<br>in the fishing and horticulture industry<br>was also identified<br>so this includes the debt bondage of<br>migrant fishes<br>often from southeast asia aboard tuna<br>fishing vessels<br>in pacific waters and and often they<br>ended up in debt bondage because they<br>had<br>to pay incredibly high recruitment fees<br>to to land a job<br>and then once working they had to pay<br>off these incredibly large fees before<br>they're<br>allowed to leave and oftentimes um you<br>know it takes months or years to be able<br>to work these<br>these fees off um debt bondage<br>in the horticulture sector of australia<br>and new zealand has also been identified<br>and this is sometimes<br>it's our pacific islander<br>neighbors who are the victims in these<br>cases sometimes<br>forced sexual exploitation and<br>commercial sexual exploitation of<br>children<br>in hospitality and tourism sectors in<br>sex work<br>and in and around the extractive<br>industries like<br>mining and logging has also been<br>identified across the region<br>so an example from the solomon islands<br>is the commercial sexual exploitation of<br>girls by males in the in the logging<br>camps<br>which is often facilitated by male<br>relatives of the girls who<br>are offered cash and cigarettes and<br>alcohol in order to arrange these<br>domestic work is also another sector<br>which is high risk in our region<br>um in 2019 in australia<br>a couple an australian couple were<br>jailed for the forced labor<br>of a fijian woman who was forced to work<br>um in their home for a period of eight<br>years<br>she had a passport confiscated and<br>um was unable to physically leave<br>um so we know that you know these these<br>are high-risk sectors<br>and then forced in early marriage again<br>certainly happens in many countries<br>across our region<br>uh an example from papua new guinea is<br>the um<br>is customary marriage of children which<br>still does occur<br>um sometimes um for children as young as<br>10 years of age<br>despite their being wars that mandate<br>that the minimum age of marriage is 18.<br>so as you can see um uh<br>these these examples illustrate that<br>it's not a sort of um<br>while there are similarities a lot among<br>a lot of these cases<br>um they um it doesn't always look the<br>same in our region<br>and i think it also illustrates that um<br>as with other regions in the world one<br>slavery tends to occur<br>in sectors um that are characterized by<br>a high migrant workforce<br>uh low skilled work and um often also<br>are labour intensive<br>so these are just a few of a few<br>examples um but you can read<br>more in our murky waters report which i<br>will link to in the chat<br>um and i think i might have a couple<br>more minutes um correct me if i'm wrong<br>james but i just wanted to um and i<br>think he have a really great<br>introduction introduction to some of<br>those push factors<br>um for uh experiences of modern slavery<br>um and i think i just wanted to also<br>mention that in the context<br>of of the pacific region um there are<br>also it's<br>like exacerbating factors um so<br>of course being highly vulnerable to the<br>effects of climate change and to<br>the impacts of natural disasters that<br>often<br>um exacerbates displacement um<br>affects people's ability to make a<br>living because of um<br>things like um uh soul intrusion into<br>the land and inability to<br>grow crops as well as<br>um impacting government's ability<br>to provide and address some of these<br>issues because of the impacts on their<br>resources and also on infrastructure<br>government infrastructure<br>um and of course the um big elephant in<br>the room is the impact of covers so<br>i mean we're seeing covert having a<br>clear impact on<br>for example the hospitality sector which<br>is um having a real um<br>really detrimental effects on people's<br>ability to<br>um to make a living and pushing people<br>further into poverty which<br>as becky said is a real driver of<br>modern slavery in our region and in the<br>in the world more generally um<br>and i think i'll probably leave it there<br>brilliant thank you elise um<br>yeah really insightful and and some<br>really powerful photos there as well<br>which<br>um yeah very similar to some of the<br>photos i have so it's uh yeah really<br>frightening<br>um over to todd cooper from transparency<br>international<br>so my name is todd cooper i'm the<br>director i'm a director of transparency<br>international<br>um i'm also director of procurement at<br>department of corrections<br>and um a congress representative for the<br>um charter institute of procurement and<br>supply so<br>um this is something that cuts to the<br>heart so what i'm going to do also is<br>um<br>yes it's done great okay okay so if i<br>just<br>start off on this one so on you know<br>it's great to hear becky talk and set<br>that foundation<br>about those horrific statistics um<br>really highlighting the problem of<br>modern slavery um and we started to talk<br>about the fact that it is a worldwide<br>problem sharing some actual examples<br>um which really pull at the heartstrings<br>in terms of the impacts these are having<br>on<br>you know societies and individuals and<br>their their families and whanau and<br>children<br>so um so what are we gonna do about it<br>um and i think you know this is where<br>where i come into interplay so<br>at the moment in new zealand you know um<br>these sorts of social issues really cut<br>to the value of<br>what's important to new zealanders and<br>embarrassing<br>and we've been really slow at reacting<br>to this you know<br>and don't take this the wrong way at<br>least this is something that you know<br>um we shouldn't be following australia<br>on we should be you know taking a real<br>world leading stance on this um we<br>should be as young as to do it<br>at the moment um sadly we've got no<br>modern slavery legislation<br>um so we've got no sanctions on goods<br>arriving from areas suspected of human<br>rights abuses<br>so literally we've done nothing from a<br>governmental perspective<br>um but there is a bit of a shift and and<br>i think that that's really important to<br>talk about so um you know historically<br>over certainly over the last two to<br>three years we've had civil society<br>banging on about um how important this<br>is um<br>we've started to see businesses come on<br>board and and this<br>recent open letter from businesses you<br>know just demonstrated the government<br>how important it is to them now from a<br>moralistic<br>stand um has really seen a lot of<br>momentum shift within government<br>so you know there are promises from<br>minister michael woods<br>um earlier in the year that the<br>government would look to introduce<br>legislation he was ambitious<br>as saying you know as early as the end<br>of 2021 um<br>so you know i think we all have an<br>obligation to keep government counted<br>accountable to that promise um they have<br>put out a draft<br>more modern slavery statement where<br>they're looking at 28 actions across<br>sort of three areas and if you see on<br>this one um we've got<br>prevention protection and enforcement so<br>they've got their 28 actions that set<br>across those three areas<br>um this is a downloadable document from<br>the internet as well so i'll see if i<br>can get some links um also with the<br>transparency international so you can<br>have a look<br>um i've really broken that down from a<br>pragmatic perspective into sort of four<br>stages so<br>um you know so you've got you've got<br>four<br>um you know four mainstays so the first<br>one is plan<br>and um there are a few principles that<br>come that come across this so<br>plan is really around getting a really<br>good understanding of what your work<br>force planning is um your<br>pre-procurement planning so<br>understanding labor rights um<br>environmental standards that come into<br>play<br>and what assurance you know measures<br>you're going to have in place<br>um understanding the supply chain you<br>know as i said this is a worldwide<br>problem um so we need to take a bit of a<br>worldwide stance in terms of our<br>planning<br>so that way um you know we can<br>understand what sort of assurance we<br>need in that and what expectations we<br>have on the suppliers<br>and that can come down to what our<br>expectations around codes of conduct<br>so then we move into the you know let me<br>move into the fourth space<br>um<br>to this one so then we move into the<br>source space so<br>so the sourcing cyber is is more around<br>you know make sure you've got the right<br>document to be going out there<br>um and we're setting those expectations<br>up in our tendering<br>um and then we get into the protection<br>side i think this is<br>you know this is something that is is<br>new to a lot of people<br>certainly in the government procurement<br>sector so you know<br>we spend um from a government<br>perspective 50 billion dollars every<br>year<br>um that buys us a lot of influence in<br>terms of changing behaviors<br>um and and influence influence in the<br>market we combine that with australia<br>we combine it with the united kingdom<br>you know we combine that with the united<br>states of america<br>we start to get huge governments being<br>influencing international markets<br>in terms of behavioral change about what<br>is not right now from a procurement<br>perspective that's shifting from a<br>traditional behavior of the lowest price<br>um race to the bottom um and that really<br>does drive exploitation and supply<br>chains<br>as businesses try to um you know try to<br>give us what we're looking for<br>there's been a real shift in that one um<br>and we're starting to see<br>um you know certainly from the new<br>zealand context so we've got<br>um you know things like um<br>the the broader outcomes and<br>progressive procurement policy and these<br>these are really driving a really strong<br>social economic environmental<br>reset and the way that we procure our<br>goods and<br>services so once you've got that<br>monitoring and you know you're<br>constantly looking at your supply chain<br>not only at the sort of tier one<br>but the expectations around having<br>visibility at tier two and tier three<br>um and pushing those onto those tier two<br>and tier three suppliers<br>i think the key thing and this is the<br>really challenging thing you know is<br>how do you react um you know how do you<br>react so<br>if you use for example a tool like ask<br>your team where you get employees to<br>fill<br>and honestly outside of surveys in terms<br>of how they're being treated<br>um so once you get information where<br>there's exploitation um<br>you know do you terminate the contract<br>um how does that solve the problem and<br>this is the really challenging part<br>and this is about that there's no<br>there's no real silver bullet to this<br>um you know so it's really about not<br>overreacting from a commercial<br>perspective<br>and trying to take a really um a really<br>collaborative<br>approach to try and address the issue um<br>and you know<br>there's a great example of you know if<br>if you find exploitation in a factory<br>at tier 2 in your supply chain and you<br>terminate that contract<br>you create 150 workers you know that<br>with that we're being exported and you<br>turn them into a intersex workers and<br>they'll be trafficked<br>in another way so you know you're<br>solving one problem by potentially<br>creating a worst problem so<br>so that the thing is about working<br>collaboratively with your supply chain<br>to address those issues<br>if they you know if they become visible<br>um<br>so i'm because i'm conscious of time um<br>but hopefully that gives you a little<br>bit of a sense around around what's<br>what's being done<br>um i do have a few links but<br>unfortunately<br>um screen is not working in terms of<br>shifting forward so um<br>that's probably it for me in terms of i<br>think my time is up so<br>um any questions let me know<br>brilliant thank you todd um<br>and so yeah with those questions um<br>please answer them<br>uh or ask those in the q a function<br>uh at the bottom of your screen um<br>polling should now be up as well<br>so um please add your responses to the<br>poll<br>um and in 15 minutes<br>um we'll announce um how that poll went<br>uh and and what we think are some of the<br>most effective<br>again to all the panelists thank you<br>very much<br>it's really informative to understand<br>your insights<br>and just i suppose the nuances<br>uh that come with modern slavery and it<br>maybe isn't<br>um as clear-cut as we'd all like it to<br>be<br>um and really understanding uh the<br>situation before we<br>react uh how important that is um but<br>also the<br>the urgent need uh to act and how<br>invasive it is<br>uh in our everyday lives<br>um with that being said um becky<br>uh one of your slides uh 34<br>each week uh is spent on on risky<br>products<br>um and i'd like to ask uh the question<br>from kay jones<br>how can we find out if a product is made<br>with slavery or coerced labor<br>it's a it's a fantastic question kay and<br>the problem at the moment is that<br>actually it's very difficult to find out<br>where our products come from in new<br>zealand because we don't have any<br>legislation in place that requires<br>um due diligence to be done by companies<br>and reporting to happen on that due<br>diligence so that's exactly why we're<br>calling<br>for this legislation so that new<br>zealanders don't need to be buying in<br>the dark<br>um but you know we think it's very yeah<br>we think as a consumer<br>your voice is important and your ability<br>to make consumer choices<br>equally we think that the government and<br>companies should be helping you to do<br>that and there's a responsibility from<br>the new zealand government to be<br>actually have a centralized reporting<br>system<br>for there to be obligations on companies<br>to take these steps and one thing i will<br>say as well is that actually<br>i don't want the narrative to be that<br>this is scary for business because<br>because what this actually does and<br>actually putting these requirements in<br>place is it creates a level playing<br>field in our economy<br>and at the moment we have an economy<br>that rewards people for cutting corners<br>and treating people badly because it<br>enables them to profit when actually we<br>want an economy that encourages<br>sustainable responsible business<br>that's better for the workers and<br>communities on the ground it's better<br>for kiwis buying the products<br>and it's also better for our business<br>environment that we're trading and<br>thank you becky at least todd anything<br>yeah yeah look i mean becca was sort of<br>spot on the you know<br>the fact that we don't have sanctions<br>and we don't visibly<br>you know communicate when we have um<br>when there is slavery within supply<br>chains overseas you know it is a concern<br>and i think<br>uh from a transparency perspective you<br>know we need to be much better<br>um at calling out these sorts of<br>behaviors these sorts of products and<br>these sorts of businesses<br>and like i said if we can get this sort<br>of reporting regime in place<br>um then we create that transparency and<br>you know kiwis can<br>you know and and i hope they would they<br>would vote with their wallet in terms of<br>making that choice<br>to you know to go with you know<br>ethical companies and we are seeing that<br>consumer change in that consumer<br>yeah and i think i'll just really<br>quickly add i agree with<br>both becky and todd and that consumers<br>want this<br>business as many businesses want this as<br>well um as<br>as he said for you know at least for you<br>know a level play<br>playing field if not because you know<br>they want to<br>you know contribute something good to to<br>the world that they operate in<br>um and you know i think it's you know<br>it's time for<br>for governments not just the new zealand<br>government you know all governments to<br>really<br>enable um enable that by putting in<br>place legislation and policies that<br>you know make it easier for um you know<br>thanks very much um i suppose<br>the next question talks a little bit<br>just to the the nuances<br>um really uh so the concept<br>of uh the social gradient appears in the<br>marmot review<br>to express inequalities exist at<br>different levels of society<br>how does the phenomena of wage slavery<br>relate to this discussion even for new<br>zealand-based jobs<br>that are considered at face value to be<br>legitimate and legal<br>do you want me to take a make a first<br>comment<br>please that would be great thanks yes um<br>so i mean<br>we talk about modern slavery or forced<br>labor in particular<br>as being on a sliding scale of of la of<br>exploitation so you're absolutely right<br>you know you can't<br>i don't think you can just look at force<br>labor without also<br>looking at labor exploitation and you<br>know while it's not<br>necessarily as extreme as forced labor<br>in some of these situations<br>around underpayment um uh overwork<br>and and those kinds of things it doesn't<br>mean that it's it's not a serious issue<br>that needs to be addressed and i think<br>um by uh addressing<br>you know the drivers of forced labor<br>we're also addressing the drivers<br>i completely agree with elise and i the<br>same i when i look at the issue of<br>forced labor and exploitation i do see<br>this on a scale and if you think on the<br>one end of the scale you have<br>labor rights that are upheld access to<br>remedy for workers and easy enforcement<br>of rights<br>then in the middle you kind of start to<br>go towards labor abuses and that may be<br>things like health and safety violations<br>you know not complying with contractual<br>terms maybe they're not even being a<br>proper contract in place<br>and that gradient gets it's more and<br>more severe and i think actually a<br>really key part of you know how i talked<br>about a holistic approach of tackling<br>this<br>is actually in society we need to be<br>striving and upholding labor rights on<br>this<br>end because that helps prevent things<br>escalating to this end<br>so there does need to be that view that<br>this is seen by as well and actually the<br>government the new zealand government's<br>um plan of action does acknowledge and<br>even i think use an image of that kind<br>of scale<br>which is really positive to see the<br>government recognizing that there needs<br>thanks very much um and uh curator<br>daniel king<br>uh todd quick question for you uh<br>will aog procurement be working together<br>to address<br>exploitation or work separately<br>well 100 working together so you know<br>the<br>there's a lot of work being done you<br>know a center net approach from the<br>ministry of business innovation and<br>employment<br>around um you know around getting you<br>know getting us sort of full behind<br>those tools templates and maturity<br>um to ensure we take a single you know a<br>single view on a single approach<br>and i think you know for most<br>procurement people um that i've talked<br>to<br>you know we need to start to talk about<br>the progress progressive consumer policy<br>um and and the the drive towards broader<br>outcomes and what that means<br>you know that is really driving a really<br>sort of a a really<br>um social currency approach to it so<br>um yeah it will be a little government<br>like i said we have to combine<br>50 billion dollars buys a big behavioral<br>change<br>you know and and that's that's the<br>thanks todd um from anonymous<br>attendee uh how can grievance mechanisms<br>help an organization address modern<br>yes certainly um<br>yeah absolutely and i mean i think there<br>are um it's not a silver bullet<br>grievance mechanisms<br>um but i think having an independent<br>grievance mechanism<br>is a great place for businesses to start<br>in terms of<br>um identifying risks within their own<br>operations<br>uh and um and also in the operations of<br>of suppliers if if there is a way to<br>also<br>um uh ensure that there are agreements<br>mechanisms within their supply chain<br>as well um as i said it's not a silver<br>bullet i think<br>you know um there are lots of barriers<br>to people reporting<br>some of these issues a lot of it is<br>around fear of losing a job which<br>as we spoke about before people are<br>often in really precarious positions<br>because of their<br>economic insecurity and so um<br>you know it's not as easy as just making<br>a complaint and then<br>being confident a lot of people there's<br>a lack of trust that that will<br>necessarily<br>end the situation and in many cases<br>maybe it won't so i think<br>it's a great starting point but there<br>needs to be a whole suite of<br>actions that business take in order to<br>reduce the risks in their own operations<br>and supply chains grievance mechanisms<br>just one of them<br>and just to add to that you know<br>you know apple and peer for example<br>using you know using<br>um anonymous surveys for staff um you<br>know to to fill out<br>um and and obviously whistleblowing and<br>all that sort of adds to the tools where<br>you know<br>we where you're starting to get it<br>you're starting to build a situation<br>where you know workers can have a voice<br>they they can put their agreements up um<br>knowing that there won't be<br>blow back on them for doing that and um<br>you know and hopefully you know we can<br>change a system where you know we will<br>address those either independently or<br>directly within an organization you know<br>through<br>um you know through the wrong roles<br>being created<br>and to support the grievances<br>thanks todd and just a follow-up<br>question um<br>for me on that really is if people uh<br>or businesses are looking to um<br>improve um their way<br>of their systems and structures to deal<br>with modern slavery<br>i'm going to put something out there<br>there perhaps um there is there are so<br>many places you can get good advice from<br>but in terms of thinking of mechanisms<br>that can work for the workers<br>i would suggest asking the workers and<br>working out you know<br>that grievance for an example as an<br>example i just want to give an example i<br>guess tangibly of where there wasn't a<br>grievous mechanism<br>and how that can itself be a risk so uh<br>we did some research in an organization<br>i was based on in the uk<br>in the cleaning sector around covert<br>cleaning particularly because there was<br>an exasperated risk for workers<br>in that sector and sexual harassment was<br>an issue but there was no grievance for<br>reporting sexual harassment and so it<br>meant for some workers<br>if they didn't respond to the sexual<br>harassment they would end up losing<br>their shifts their cleaning shifts<br>and so you can see it actually building<br>into exploitation not having those<br>effective mechanisms<br>but what would work for those workers in<br>terms of feeling confident to come<br>forward and report i think that they<br>should be involved in some of those<br>discussions<br>and the community should be however<br>again holistic there are so many great<br>places to go to help but i'm going to<br>let<br>my colleagues chip in on this because i<br>know they'll have some really tangible<br>examples<br>i think it can be quite overwhelming for<br>businesses because often there<br>is so much information and it's not<br>always practical<br>um we'll just do a little uh a sprig for<br>walk freeze website we actually have a<br>really great business hub<br>on our website where um we we collate<br>not our own tools but tools<br>from um a range of different<br>organizations that<br>um can help businesses to increase<br>transparency in their supply chains and<br>identify risks<br>um so that's one one place to go um<br>and it would be fantastic to see um<br>and you know this doesn't it doesn't<br>really answer the question but it'll be<br>fantastic to see<br>new zealand um once the government<br>passes<br>supply chain legislation really having<br>some fantastic<br>um guidance around how businesses can do<br>that as a as part of the process<br>which is something that australia and um<br>the uk have done so i'm sure that<br>new zealand will do it even better<br>yeah and i think at least that you know<br>that that is starting to come and i<br>think<br>you know there's an initiative um like i<br>said with mbie and and<br>where they're starting to put that that<br>material up for businesses to start<br>thinking about what they want to do<br>um you know before the legislation is in<br>place<br>we don't want to be reactive in this and<br>i think we're seeing that that come<br>through<br>you know quite strongly um you know<br>ultimately some of these are tools and<br>there's plenty of material out there<br>around<br>you know um you know obviously you know<br>from yourselves<br>um from world vision all that in terms<br>of how businesses do it there are plenty<br>of consulting firms out there that will<br>help<br>um to drive um you know modern slavery<br>statements<br>and what that means and trying to recast<br>their vision values and principles<br>you know around these sorts of things um<br>but in terms of looking at the supply<br>chain<br>you know again you know the tools that<br>help you identify some of these red<br>flags<br>um are important um there are there are<br>international organizations that will<br>you know<br>um that will call out um you know<br>businesses<br>um and so it's just a matter of being<br>able to tap in and<br>and again um it it's just where you look<br>brilliant thanks todd uh so just letting<br>you know um<br>we will do one more minute uh on the<br>poll<br>uh and then we will announce what the<br>the<br>poll results are and then we will<br>continue<br>um the discussion on those poll results<br>and and also<br>um any other questions but um before we<br>announce the poll results i'll ask<br>one more question from graham<br>and that is is there an example of a<br>modern slavery law<br>that is accepted as best practice that<br>countries like new zealand<br>could use as a starting point and what<br>countries are doing particularly well<br>here<br>perhaps i could share some experience<br>from the uk and i know obviously at<br>least we'll have a lot of experience<br>from the australian sector but i<br>i guess i want to emphasize that maybe<br>where the uk and the commonwealth have<br>been<br>at for me as a starting point and it's<br>been really positive<br>that the uk did bring in the mon slavery<br>act and it was held to be<br>you know an amazing step forward in this<br>this movement<br>but in terms of the transparency<br>provisions particularly<br>that was a lot of work to do and initial<br>analysis of the act once it had been<br>enforced for a number of years by<br>independent organization<br>found that only i think two out of five<br>companies that should have been<br>complying with that provision were<br>and there were some real you know<br>obvious reasons for this<br>partly it was because there was no<br>central reporting system it was just<br>left a civil society to actually monitor<br>what was going on<br>so there's not a lot of incentive for<br>compliance there were no penalties there<br>was no<br>you know not a single injunction was was<br>put against any of those companies that<br>didn't comply<br>and also there was not enough clarity<br>around what companies were supposed to<br>do<br>which the australian act has improved on<br>or at least touch on that um in terms of<br>actually being specific about what is<br>required<br>to discharge the obligation what i will<br>say though is the uk's modern slave<br>reactors<br>is you know that section itself has been<br>reformed and there are improvements but<br>i strongly believe new zealand can do a<br>lot better<br>we can also look at what our european<br>colleagues are doing and they're<br>actually bringing in<br>due diligence provisions and we've just<br>seen law passed in norway<br>and germany in june and i could spend a<br>long time talking about those laws but<br>maybe give them a google<br>and to see what actually is being done<br>by europe and i think you know we need<br>to have our eyes open in new zealand<br>it's not just about being compatible<br>with the uk and australia<br>but also our european um i guess friends<br>as well because<br>you know we want to be consistent with<br>what's going on there and i hope even<br>better<br>yes we hope that too um over here in<br>australia we want to see new zealand<br>do much better um yes i think<br>the uk um modern slavery act was a great<br>starting point the australian modern<br>slavery act has tried to<br>um improve on that using lessons learned<br>from the uk<br>case study one thing that was really<br>great about the uk legislation is that<br>they built in<br>a review so that um you know after a<br>period<br>of years there was a it was required to<br>you know basically touch basically how<br>it was going<br>what were the gaps what was going well<br>what wasn't going well how can you<br>improve it<br>one of the things that the australian<br>legislation has done is have<br>um the central repository which becky<br>was talking about which<br>houses the the statements that<br>businesses have to make<br>the threshold is a little bit lower for<br>australian businesses and i think it's<br>important to<br>um to you know ensure that you know<br>we're capturing all<br>um major businesses so that we can kind<br>of have that tipping point effect<br>um and i think you know what we would<br>really like to see<br>is um penalties for businesses<br>not um not reporting<br>under the act if that's if they're<br>required to do so um that's certainly<br>i agree somewhere that we're falling<br>short in that regard<br>yeah i think you know i think we've got<br>the advantage of not being the first<br>mover on<br>this so you know if we don't improve<br>upon<br>you know australia we don't improve upon<br>the uk then we then we've missed the<br>boat on that one and i think look he<br>said the penalties is a big one and i<br>know that's<br>you know a lot of criticism that comes<br>out of the australian one is there there<br>are very little consequences<br>for falling to adhere to it so you know<br>we certainly want to get the right and i<br>think we need to take a<br>you know um instead of adopting um the<br>same as the uk we need to really look at<br>what works for the new zealand<br>environment and sizes it appropriately<br>and communicated properly<br>thanks everyone and<br>thank you to everyone watching<br>and uh for submitting um<br>your your poll uh answers<br>um what we're going to do now is um the<br>panelists<br>if they click on the polling down below<br>they should be able to<br>um see the polling results and we're<br>we're going to open it up really<br>for a conversation about what some of<br>these results are<br>and i think for me that's interesting<br>about you know what are the easy things<br>to do and what are the challenging<br>uh things to do um it's really positive<br>to see<br>um set 77 percent i will talk with other<br>people to raise more awareness about<br>modern slavery which i think is really<br>promising<br>um one of the lower ones sitting at 38<br>is i will protest and demand action from<br>government to do more<br>to end modern slavery i thought i might<br>open that up to the panelists<br>um as to uh yeah<br>what role do we do we have as citizens<br>to advocate for this with our government<br>well i think i think a huge role i mean<br>ultimately when it comes down to where<br>democracy<br>the voice of the people is what matters<br>the most so um<br>you know i mean i was surprised to see<br>that as low as it was and<br>maybe that's because there is you know a<br>lack of understanding of what modern<br>slavery is and<br>this is a this is something that happens<br>overseas and not in new zealand and i<br>think<br>there's an educational piece around that<br>um<br>but ultimately you know the government<br>work for the people<br>so um you know if from a groundswell<br>perspective this is what we want<br>um this is what will happen and like i<br>said we're seeing the change because<br>i don't know you've got a civil society<br>but you've got businesses starting to<br>bang on<br>now you know if we start to see the you<br>know the joe public bearing on about<br>this as well then<br>you know you will see it accelerate so<br>yeah i agree with todd wholeheartedly on<br>that one that i think<br>certainly we need um consumer voices um<br>to be louder<br>and i agree that's probably part of the<br>reason that it is quite<br>the response is quite low is around<br>maybe not not knowing<br>um that it is a significant issue that<br>impacts<br>you know australia and new zealand and<br>um other<br>more developed countries um i think<br>linked to that is um<br>it's also the response was quite low<br>with regards to<br>um asking political parties and<br>representatives to undertake action so<br>that's obviously<br>quite well linked to you know demanding<br>government action<br>when and it's such an important um<br>avenue to call for change um<br>to actually really let your local member<br>know that<br>this is an issue that's important to you<br>and then and also you know<br>vote for the people those<br>representatives who<br>um you know advocating for policy change<br>which will improve<br>labor rights and will um bring in<br>legislation which will<br>level the playing field for businesses<br>in terms of supply chain and<br>transparency and<br>do want to bring in legislation that um<br>for example<br>uh you know stops imports of um goods<br>with high risk of<br>forced labor at the borders these kind<br>of things so i think you know um<br>i understand why like there are some<br>reasons why that might be low but i<br>think you know it's<br>it's really important to um let<br>the government know that this is an<br>issue that is important to you<br>just to echo that as well i think<br>sometimes um<br>it can seem a bit scary and like this<br>isn't you know asking anybody to like<br>you know<br>stay overnight and at the bottom of the<br>beehive necessarily in order to get<br>government attention but i completely<br>reiterate what<br>elise and todd have said and just to<br>give some really tangible things that<br>can you can do to show<br>your mp and government that you care<br>about this you can write to your mp<br>and usually the mp has their email<br>address if you just google your mp that<br>will come up how to contact them<br>if you that's too much work i think you<br>can tweet or tag your mp on social media<br>say you've been to this event and hey<br>you really care about this<br>hey can you get involved actually the<br>government at some point i really hope<br>that they will open this up to public<br>consultation and<br>that's something that you can contribute<br>to as a member of the public and say<br>that it's important to you that the<br>public that the government prioritize<br>this and<br>not to underestimate actually how<br>important as a new zealander your voice<br>is to government<br>showing that this should be a priority<br>for them on their agenda governments<br>have a lot of things on their books that<br>they need to get across<br>so actually a public you know showing<br>that the public are interested engaged<br>in what action<br>thanks that's that's really useful um<br>one of the things i was quite um<br>positive to see is also<br>just some of the support for uh the<br>organizations in this room<br>um again you know it can be<br>quite confronting to put yourself out<br>there and so being able to you know be<br>part of<br>um a network and an action i was<br>wondering if<br>um you'd be able to speak a little bit<br>to um<br>you know with the organizations that<br>you're representing today how can people<br>get involved with<br>what you're promoting and what you're<br>i can start us off and obviously give<br>time for um<br>my colleagues on the call but yes<br>absolutely would really welcome<br>um not it doesn't even just need to be<br>financial support to our programs on the<br>ground of course that is welcome but<br>if you're not in a position to give or<br>you don't want to give you're still<br>welcome to be<br>involved in what world vision are doing<br>in the space and we want to equip you<br>to help you become more aware of these<br>issues i guess educate on what they mean<br>for you as a new zealander and the<br>context that we work in<br>and i guess hope activate you to kind of<br>make some steps of action and maybe some<br>of those steps are the ones<br>listed in the poll so something that you<br>can do is check out our advocacy<br>page on our website and i think what<br>we're going to be introducing<br>soon over like the course is actually a<br>bit of a journey and for people to<br>subscribe onto so we can talk about<br>these issues and help with that<br>education awareness process you are very<br>welcome<br>and um yeah would be great to to kind of<br>continue this relationship i guess<br>because it's actually really important<br>for us that um you know we don't see<br>ourselves as doing this just as an<br>organization<br>we see ourselves being a voice for the<br>communities on the ground and for the<br>supporters and the public in new zealand<br>lisa yeah so from from a transparency<br>international perspective<br>obviously as a global organization as<br>well you know we have the new zealand<br>chapter<br>um so good ways to get involved at the<br>start is<br>is to you know just join our newsletter<br>and just be vocal with us<br>and and you know get that two-way<br>dialogue going um and if you see value<br>become a member<br>um which helps to support us and get<br>involved in some of the initiatives that<br>we're um you know that we're pushing<br>forward um you know<br>the latest one for example fisa are<br>around driving um<br>you know um awareness of the financial<br>integrity um<br>you know without within our financial<br>systems and so i mean a good<br>organization but i think it starts with<br>us<br>um you know with the newsletter and and<br>potentially<br>becoming a member um then eventually if<br>you want to get really involved um<br>you know um you know george jorwan is a<br>member of delegated authority i know<br>um james is involved in that and then<br>you eventually might want to become a<br>director<br>thanks dad elise um<br>how can people get involved with and<br>support the work that<br>our walk free has done<br>um well certainly following following<br>our<br>our research uh reports and and um<br>informing yourself about what are the<br>latest trends<br>um in are in modern slavery we've got<br>our next global slavery index that's<br>coming out next year<br>and we also have the next global<br>estimates of modern slavery which we<br>produce<br>in partnership with the international<br>labour organization<br>and the international organization for<br>migration which is coming out early next<br>year so we'll have some updated figures<br>on<br>the extent of the issue and i think<br>really using these<br>to um yeah chat chat to your friends and<br>your family<br>and um and let them know the<br>significance of the issue and i think<br>then<br>you know in whatever role you take in<br>society whether it's as an investor as a<br>business person<br>uh as a voter as a consumer um<br>you know get involved on the issue and i<br>think um<br>walt free will be very very grateful if<br>brilliant thank you um one of the<br>questions<br>um from shamilla is how does modern<br>slavery<br>really good question um and i think you<br>know it often gets<br>talked about in uh the you know<br>in the same sentence sometimes so i<br>think it can be a little bit<br>confusing um slavery of the past is very<br>much about you know<br>you know physical um physical<br>shackles almost um and and<br>while modern slavery there can be that<br>physical element of coercion<br>um often it's not uh and so<br>i think it's important it's often more<br>subtle and not as obvious modern slavery<br>so<br>um you know it is around and you know<br>becky talked about that you know<br>um psychological um coercion and those<br>kind of things<br>that keep people in situations of modern<br>slavery and<br>and you know i think that's the the<br>really<br>the main issue is that it doesn't has to<br>have to be physical confinement or<br>physical<br>um restrictions to to be considered<br>modern slavery<br>yeah just a comment i agree with elise<br>and i think one of the really<br>actually scary things about one slavery<br>is that this isn't<br>new what's happening it's just suddenly<br>got kind of a lot more data and research<br>and understanding in the last couple of<br>decades to be honest and that's<br>part of the inherent evil to me that<br>this has been so<br>easy to hide in a way and part of that<br>is because of the lack of legislation<br>around transparency and reporting and us<br>having<br>you know really good systems in place to<br>address this that's part of the problem<br>and why it has been hidden<br>but that's not in any way to say that<br>this hasn't been around unfortunately<br>you know<br>it's been part of our the way that we've<br>been running things and that's why<br>it needs to stop<br>thanks um yeah one of the one of the<br>questions that's been<br>raised um and we talked a little bit um<br>about it just in terms of<br>uh climate and how that's influencing<br>more people but how people<br>can it's quite difficult to monitor when<br>you're looking<br>at the international marketplace<br>so a question from omar is you know<br>different countries have different<br>labor and employment laws and their<br>national standards<br>also importers are looking for cheap<br>labor costs so how<br>when i talked earlier about um you know<br>understanding international markets so<br>you know you really need to leverage um<br>you know<br>what what foreign bodies your what<br>offices you've got over there so for new<br>zealand for example we have<br>you know missions in many countries<br>around the world that we can leverage in<br>terms of understanding you know local<br>labor laws and that you know so that we<br>can work within those<br>and understand them because it you know<br>everyone's going to be different you<br>know<br>we're not going to pay a living way in<br>new zealand living wage if we're<br>recruiting<br>you know from a supply chain overseas um<br>you know because it just<br>it throws their whole um<br>you know market out so so it's about<br>really understanding<br>it's about really understanding and like<br>i said you know it's about ensuring that<br>you're putting the right um<br>mechanisms and due diligence in place<br>that's<br>probably the starting point is it<br>probably an area release is pretty<br>strong with warp free<br>yeah i think you're right like you don't<br>want you<br>you don't want to address the issue just<br>one location and then it to be displaced<br>into another country like you<br>you might stop sourcing goods from<br>xinjiang and china but that doesn't<br>necessarily mean<br>that you know it's not still happening<br>in another location people are sourcing<br>goods from other high-risk areas or<br>other high-risk sectors so i think it's<br>really about<br>you know this you know trying to bring<br>all<br>governments on board to really really<br>try to reduce the risks in their<br>countries<br>that is obviously a massive thing to do<br>um and i think you know and again it<br>comes back to you know<br>asking your your government<br>representatives to<br>you know have those diplomatic meetings<br>and you know call on<br>um you know other countries governments<br>to<br>um improve labor standards and you know<br>you know come together with other<br>countries<br>in your region or outside of the region<br>um<br>and have you know agreements around<br>labor practices and things like that and<br>um i think<br>i mean it's a long road but i don't that<br>doesn't mean we can't<br>make you know huge improvements if we<br>really make a concerted effort to bring<br>everybody on board absolutely and i<br>think that's why there is<br>a huge point to say as new zealand we do<br>need to clean up our own backyard<br>because we do need to be<br>really i guess encouraging in our<br>diplomacy and our international<br>relations for<br>labor standards to be upheld and to be<br>improved as well as human rights across<br>the board<br>but if we're not upholding them in our<br>own country how can we be in a position<br>to say that<br>so you know i i do i do really think<br>that part of good international raising<br>of standards<br>brilliant thank you um and a question<br>i'm cured of david<br>from david duncheeth what progress is<br>required to new zealand visa legislation<br>to substantially reduce the likelihood<br>is that question about the changes that<br>are being introduced by mbie is<br>if i understood that right i'm uh but do<br>you want to um give us a bit of an<br>update as to what some of those changes<br>are<br>i understand that there's been an<br>introduction of a six<br>uh visa that's accessible for a worker<br>that reports exploitation<br>my understanding though is that there<br>are still in my mind a few<br>issues with that visa because i believe<br>at the end of that six-month period they<br>need to have secured<br>another work visa that's again tied to<br>an employer<br>so i have an issue with worker visas<br>that are tied to an employer because i<br>think that creates a breeding ground for<br>exploitation unfortunately<br>i also have an issue with people on work<br>visas that come in and aren't able to<br>access any of the safety nets of our<br>society<br>despite being paying tax and being<br>contributing to our economy because that<br>means a push<br>factor if somebody can't access housing<br>or you know employment support while<br>they're trying to find another job<br>then they're going to be more likely to<br>stay with an exploitative employer<br>because otherwise they're going to be<br>destitute<br>so actually my recommendations for<br>immigration<br>visas to protect those that are<br>identified and come forward<br>as um you know survivors of exploitation<br>is that they should be<br>then given an extension of a visa that's<br>for the whole period of the initial<br>grant that came through<br>that isn't tied to any particular<br>employer so that they don't end up in a<br>similar situation or they don't end up<br>having to be removed or returned home<br>despite this terrible thing happening<br>on our country and they can continue to<br>contribute to the economy and continue<br>to send<br>money home to their family or for the<br>reasons that they came in the first<br>place<br>i also think i'll add on to this as well<br>that this needs to be done in<br>contingency with access to remedy<br>through the employment tribunal<br>it's not just about criminal um<br>prosecution which though is very<br>important<br>but an employer an employee in this<br>country if they haven't been paid<br>properly and they've been treated badly<br>they should be able to access those lost<br>wages so they actually have remedy for<br>what's happened to them<br>and we should be making sure that<br>there's a really easy mechanism for that<br>there's not much you can add to that<br>becky but other than to say you know we<br>should have learned a lot during covert<br>with the vulnerabilities of<br>a lot of our micro workers you know who<br>were stranded in new zealand without any<br>support mechanism<br>you know and a government unwilling to<br>budge on that and you know we certainly<br>don't want to see<br>you know new visa rules basically<br>you know replicate that issue in a<br>long-term basis<br>so i certainly support becky's view<br>yeah and i'll add to that as well i<br>agree in australia we had a similar<br>situation in terms of you know having<br>um our you know pacifis pacific island<br>workers<br>you know over on seasonal work permits<br>who were stranded in australia without<br>access to support services<br>um and uh that obviously<br>you know echoes similar situation to<br>new zealand and i think it's also really<br>important to have<br>pathways to to permanent permanency and<br>citizenship as well because<br>in many cases it's an expired visa that<br>unscrupulous employers use to hold over<br>the heads of workers<br>and you know threaten them with<br>deportation basically<br>if um if they don't do what they're<br>they're asking so i think<br>and we've got one last question uh from<br>doug adam<br>which is what is the experience so far<br>from the uk<br>legislations<br>i think we touched on that a little bit<br>briefly in the conversation but i guess<br>just to recap so<br>i know in the uk the legislation was<br>brought in and it addresses quite a<br>broad spectrum of things so it sort of<br>um<br>really sort of consolidates the criminal<br>definitions and also<br>the um i guess the terms of imprisonment<br>if you are convicted of trafficking it<br>brings in a really which i think is a<br>really positive thing<br>a defense for somebody that is exploited<br>um criminally so an example of that<br>is in the uk a lot of vietnamese<br>children or nationals can be<br>exploited and forced to grow cannabis<br>and that's a criminal offence right<br>obviously the production of drugs but if<br>it's found to be in connection to<br>trafficking this triggers a defense<br>so that they don't end up with a<br>criminal record a criminal record is<br>another thing that can drive somebody<br>into exploitation because it's so hard<br>to get<br>a job so um that's a really positive<br>thing that it creates a provision<br>um for an independent anti-slavery<br>commissioner i would be really pro and<br>independent anti-slavery commissioner<br>being in place in new zealand i think<br>it's a really valuable<br>uh i guess an asset for the sector to<br>have as long as that role is independent<br>and there has been<br>you know interesting debate in the uk<br>about the independence of the role<br>because of it's sitting with the home<br>office a conversation for another day<br>but the current independent slavery<br>commissioner has done some really<br>positive work<br>and as had her predecessor um and you<br>know it also<br>provides obviously the stuff we talked<br>about tonight the supply chain the<br>reporting<br>it really encompasses a lot and it's a<br>great starting place but there is much<br>more work to be done<br>we have a lot more research<br>understanding and learnings from what's<br>taken place in that jurisdiction and<br>others<br>and so hence a great opportunity to<br>provide something for a new zealand<br>context that's really<br>yes totally agree with that and um in<br>terms of the independent<br>commissioner i think that's something<br>that the australian legislation is<br>really lacking<br>having that independent person that<br>really oversees the<br>national strategy to address modern<br>slavery<br>um and so looking forward to seeing new<br>zealand<br>having an independent commissioner as<br>part of their legislation as well<br>brilliant thank you very much um and<br>uh just thank you um<br>becky todd and elise um for<br>joining us on the panel uh today some<br>really uh insightful comments<br>um certainly improved you know my<br>understanding and knowledge of modern<br>slavery<br>um and also i think um<br>some really tangible actions uh that we<br>can take out of this<br>um uh thank you also to everyone that<br>has joined us<br>uh this evening from all around the<br>world<br>um yeah we really appreciate<br>the support and your interest in modern<br>slavery<br>and um it's great to see uh<br>you know the poll and the actions that<br>everyone is prepared to take<br>to um yeah address something that is so<br>pervasive in our society and um<br>how deceptive it can be and how it<br>continues<br>uh to change names and you know<br>make its way into a society so um i<br>really appreciate uh<br>everyone joining us and discussion<br>and i will hand over to julie<br>who has um who will do a final wrap-up<br>so thank you once again from me from the<br>panelists<br>and look forward to uh catching you on<br>and uh thanks very much james for um<br>guiding us being a helmsman tonight that<br>was a really great job<br>um so just before people leave melinda<br>is going to share a link<br>through to a give a little page which is<br>called it's the money would go to friend<br>fiji which is a great organization in<br>fiji<br>um who are also distributing packages<br>of support to migrant workers in fiji<br>along with other people<br>we know that the people in fiji are<br>doing it really hard and we thought as a<br>way of sort of thinking directly<br>thanking<br>us it would be a way to actually give<br>some something to also to<br>these organizations this organization of<br>3g through that link which is a new<br>zealand<br>based organization beckett raising some<br>money and they'll<br>pass it on to friend fiji so i just<br>thought i'd hand that on<br>so i just as people are going thank you<br>so much and um<br>yeah so yeah hi today and also um<br>to the to our fijian friends um and<br>and to everybody um thanks very much and<br>and we<br>look forward to holding another one in<br>the near future thank you very much also<br>to<br>karen lustfiezen from victoria<br>university brian p co-chair and ethical<br>leadership<br>for helping us get this going and being<br>part of it</p></main><footer
