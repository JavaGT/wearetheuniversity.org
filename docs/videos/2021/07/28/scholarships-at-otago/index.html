at the school you can also choose<br>the last<br>option so in this case we'll say dpd<br>head<br>student again for community roles you<br>can select as many as applicable<br>or if you haven't had any particular<br>roles in the community there's the last<br>option<br>so for example here we'll say that we're<br>a chair of a community group<br>and then we ask you to provide<br>statements in relation

attended<br>different science camps or different<br>fears<br>please just put in the examples that are<br>appropriate to your situation<br>the next section is sporting and<br>cultural again you're asked if you wish<br>to be considered for such scholarships<br>and there's a drop down list that allows<br>you to list your highest performance<br>activity<br>if your activity is not included in this<br>list there is an option to select other<br>but as you can see it is quite<br>a comprehensive list of activities so<br>please check through to see if your<br>activity is there before selecting other<br>it concludes both sporting and cultural<br>activities so please choose which is<br>appropriate to you<br>and you can give your statements as an<br>examples in relation to that activity<br>once you've given your answers again<br>there's a 200 word limit<br>you can answer the question whether you<br>intend to continue to participate in<br>your performance activity while at otago<br>there is no compulsion that you have to<br>but it is good to know for our records<br>moving on to the next section we ask if<br>you've participated in any<br>extracurricular activities while at<br>school<br>this could be for example the duke of<br>edinburgh awards<br>and again you're asked if you wish to<br>provide more information in relation to<br>this<br>and can give up to three examples the<br>next section is in relation to the<br>multi-instrument scholarships<br>to begin with you're asked if you wish<br>to be considered for such scholarships<br>yes or no you have the ability here if<br>you are of maori ancestry to apply for<br>these scholarships<br>and you're asked to provide statements<br>in relation to your experiences<br>and personal and professional career<br>aspirations<br>where you can put statements the word<br>limit within these boxes<br>has been extended to allow you to<br>provide more information<br>and we also ask that you provide the<br>contact details of a referee<br>who might be able to provide comment in<br>relation to your responses that you have<br>provided<br>this would normally have to be a third<br>party person so<br>not somebody who's directly related to<br>in the aspect of a parent or sibling<br>and we would ask that you provide the<br>contact details and make sure that you<br>speak with your<br>referee so that they're aware that you<br>have nominated them<br>as somebody to comment in relation to<br>your application<br>once you're satisfied with this you can<br>save and continue<br>and move on to the next question which<br>is the pacific section<br>which is very similar to the maori<br>section again do you wish to be<br>considered for such scholarships<br>you're asked to provide your involvement<br>with specific communities<br>and what are your professional career<br>aspirations<br>we ask that you provide the contact<br>details for someone who can act as a<br>referee to

general context of what your<br>circumstances are<br>and the impact and opportunity that the<br>scholarship will allow you to have<br>for this particular section we do ask<br>that the contact referee<br>is a parent or caregiver who can give<br>direct contact<br>in relation to your financial<br>circumstances of your family<br>it doesn't have to be a third party as<br>they don't necessarily have to be<br>involved with knowing what your<br>financial circumstances of your family<br>is<br>so a parent or caregiver is the best<br>person to provide a comment in this<br>relationship<br>we also ask any questions in relation to<br>work<br>and if you are eligible for a family<br>community services card<br>so please answer as appropriate that<br>you're aware of the situation<br>and you can save

attend the university<br>so please tell us this information<br>because it's worth taking into<br>consideration when we assess the<br>entrance scholarships<br>again if this is not applicable to you<br>you can select these options<br>and we also ask that you would provide a<br>non-family member who can be a reference<br>in relation<br>to providing information in regards to<br>your family circumstances<br>again this would be a third party<br>verification so somebody within the<br>community group<br>or somebody within the school who can<br>provide the best comment in relation to<br>your circumstances<br>the next section is the disability<br>scholarship information again you asked<br>if you wish to be considered for such<br>scholarships<br>and you're given a text box to be able<br>to provide information in relation to<br>your disability impairment or medical<br>condition<br>and the impact that it has had on your<br>high school results and your access to<br>university study we also ask that you<br>provide a non-family member who can<br>discuss the impact of your disability<br>and you may choose<br>to use the same referees as previously<br>but we would ask that it would be<br>somebody who can give comment in<br>relation to your study<br>for example a doctor may confirm that<br>you have a disability but they may not<br>be able to provide information in<br>relation to your study<br>so please choose the appropriate person<br>who can comment<br>once you've gone through and answered<br>that question you get to the final<br>section which is the privacy statement<br>and
