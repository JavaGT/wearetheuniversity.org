government webinar<br>to discuss the 2021 budget um i'm jane<br>bryson i'm the<br>acting pro vice chancellor and dean of<br>the wellington school of business and<br>government<br>and i'm a professor in the management<br>group<br>welcome i can see that grant robertson<br>is online with us now too<br>thanks to you all for joining us online<br>for this budget 2021 discussion<br>we're sorry that the change in covert<br>alert levels um<br>has meant that we couldn't host you in<br>rutherford house the home<br>of the wellington school of business and<br>government which is only five minutes<br>walk from parliament<br>and government departments where all<br>these budget decisions get made<br>we hope to see you here some other time<br>it's great that we had nearly 290<br>students and their teachers due to<br>attend this<br>in-person event today but we had always<br>intended to film the session as we did<br>last year<br>so that students all around the country<br>can have an opportunity to hear from the<br>minister too<br>so welcome also if you are watching this<br>as a recording<br>and thank you to those that are here<br>online<br>as a capital city business school<br>embedded in the heart of wellington we<br>draw on the expertise of the businesses<br>and government organizations around us<br>to<br>inform our teaching and research<br>you may have noticed in our name that<br>we're not just a business school<br>we're a school of business and<br>government<br>and that on not only reflects our<br>location but also because<br>business and government are two groups<br>of people<br>and activities that fundamentally<br>influence<br>and shape the society we live in to<br>study one group<br>without considering the other is only to<br>get part of the picture<br>so through our unique combination of<br>business and government<br>expertise our students gain a valuable<br>set of skills that prepares them<br>hopefully for extraordinary careers in<br>either business or government<br>or both and hosting events like this<br>demonstrates<br>the university's close connections and<br>physical proximity to<br>um and our unique track record of<br>engagement<br>um with with government a big thank you<br>to grant robertson and his parliamentary<br>colleagues<br>for always being willing to have these<br>to the students and teachers watching we<br>would love to have you here studying a<br>bachelor of commerce or a diploma or a<br>master's program with us<br>we've got great staff who are passionate<br>about education<br>and exploration and the rapidly changing<br>world<br>of business and government i don't think<br>it's ever changed as rapidly as it has<br>in the last few years<br>sustainability ethics entrepreneurship<br>and innovation<br>well-being these are some of the current<br>themes<br>that run through many of our<br>disciplinary areas economics<br>finance accounting commercial law<br>management marketing<br>international business tourism public<br>policy and information systems<br>so i'll just quickly run through some<br>ways that<br>students might consider connecting with<br>the wellington school of business and<br>government before i<br>formally introduce the minister and we<br>get into the the heart of the<br>so um now is a sort of<br>prime time for engagement with the<br>university there's a lot going<br>on here are some key dates there are<br>information evenings that have been<br>running since may<br>and will continue to run<br>and we also have scholarships<br>that have opened in mid-june and<br>the deadline for applying for those is<br>at the beginning of september<br>august you can start applying for<br>residential halls<br>and the big event really is the 20th of<br>august which is the university open day<br>but of course we're keen and interested<br>to<br>engage with you at at any time<br>just move to the next slide which shows<br>our school leaver<br>scholarships we have many of these<br>to award to talented school leavers<br>of different values<br>and just go online to<br>our scholarship site to have a look at<br>those in more detail<br>oops i think we've missed a slide here<br>um also if your high school is wanting<br>to visit<br>uh wellington um and visit us here at<br>the wellington school of business and<br>government<br>um when we're not at alert level two um<br>then you're most welcome to um we've got<br>a description here of the sorts of<br>things that we do when you come to us<br>for the day<br>taste a lecture someone from business to<br>speak to you<br>an overview of what it would be like to<br>be a student here<br>so schools can get in touch with rachel<br>thacker or<br>jackie harper the the people that have<br>been in touch with you already<br>if if you're wanting to come and visit<br>us<br>so there are various ways to connect<br>with us<br>please come and look at our website look<br>at us on linkedin<br>we're on twitter we're also on facebook<br>so link with us through<br>through any of those mechanisms and we'd<br>so i mentioned before that business and<br>government are two<br>groups of people and activities that<br>fundamentally influence and shape the<br>society we live in<br>and to study one group without<br>considering the others to only get part<br>of the picture<br>and that's the challenge that the<br>government has<br>in its budget task every year<br>balancing that complex mix of<br>interdependencies<br>that enable our society to function and<br>thrive<br>to achieve well-being individually and<br>collectively<br>and the budget this year is a prime<br>example<br>balancing issues of covert employment<br>unemployment housing health education<br>climate change productivity i'm sure we<br>will all have lots of questions about<br>that balancing act<br>so it's really my pleasure to welcome<br>and introduce the honourable<br>grant robertson deputy prime minister mp<br>for wellington central<br>my mp um minister of finance<br>minister for infrastructure minister for<br>racing<br>and importantly minister of sport and<br>recreation<br>so he is responsible for the black caps<br>win<br>grant has a presentation that he will<br>talk through for about 30 minutes<br>i will move through the slides for him<br>assuming my cursor works correctly um<br>and then he'll answer questions for<br>those of you that are participating in<br>this event<br>live in the webinar you can type your<br>questions<br>in online in the<br>question and answer section<br>and you can vote for questions i believe<br>so if you see a question that you really<br>want to see answered you can vote for it<br>there's no pressure grant<br>um and it's my job at the end<br>uh once grant's talked through his<br>slides to<br>make sure that he picks up the questions<br>and there are also a few questions that<br>we received in advance from a couple of<br>schools<br>which i will put into the mix as well so<br>hopefully all our technology works<br>smoothly<br>and and grant i will click through to um<br>your slides uh thank you jane<br>um<br>greetings everybody um it's great to be<br>with you i am sorry that we're not in a<br>position to be able to<br>have today's uh session um all together<br>but it is a reminder to all of us that<br>um we are still very much living<br>with covet 19 both here in new zealand<br>and around the world<br>and that was as james already alluded to<br>one of the<br>issues that we were dealing with with<br>putting the budget together<br>was that despite the fact that in new<br>zealand we've had an extended period<br>with<br>limited restrictions or no restrictions<br>on our movement and<br>our social and economic activity many<br>other countries in the world still face<br>those restrictions and indeed<br>are now facing third and fourth waves of<br>the virus and so<br>that shadow of covert 19 was very much<br>cast<br>over the budget and was one of the main<br>things we had to bear in mind<br>in putting the budget together this year<br>our focus was on the title of the budget<br>which you'll see on the screen which is<br>securing our recovery<br>this is very much the idea that new<br>zealand's response to covet 19 has been<br>very positive<br>and very good and it has put us in a<br>strong position to be able to recover<br>but there are certain things we needed<br>to do to make sure that we did secure<br>that<br>we also have to continue to look to the<br>long term in our budgeting process<br>um obviously what gets focused on in<br>most budgets is for spending<br>the new spending that will be done over<br>the coming year or two or three years<br>beyond that<br>but equally we have to keep an eye on<br>the long-term fiscal situation for new<br>zealand so that includes our levels of<br>debt<br>um whether or not we're able to run an<br>operating surplus<br>and other indicators such as<br>unemployment and so on and so<br>those uh balance of providing for the<br>here and now and the needs that we have<br>in a long-term um fiscal situation that<br>leaves future generations is at least<br>as well off if not better off than we<br>have been is very important to us<br>we go to the next slide jane um and this<br>is the test of your cursor<br>is to see if it was i can see your<br>cursor so that's something encouraging<br>um there we are so as many of you will<br>know<br>um since 2019 we've been putting our<br>budgets together<br>using a well-being approach and this is<br>essentially based<br>on a piece of work done by the new<br>zealand treasury called the living<br>standards framework<br>and what that does is look at our<br>society and our economy not just through<br>the lens of our financial<br>position which we do but in addition to<br>that<br>how we're doing it looking after our<br>people our environment and our<br>communities<br>and the framework that the treasury has<br>designed uses the language of economists<br>to describe that<br>which is to talk about the four capitals<br>so those are financial<br>human natural and social or as i say<br>essentially<br>the money the people the environment and<br>our communities and we use that<br>framework<br>to decide not only what to invest in but<br>also to measure our success and part of<br>our budget documentation<br>is something called the well-being<br>outlook it's quite a long document and<br>on the slide there you'll just see some<br>small highlights from it<br>if i can just briefly characterize them<br>that is that new zealand's well-being<br>held up pretty well through covert and<br>in fact was actually slightly higher as<br>we moved through covert<br>um as people i think felt supported both<br>by measures that the government took but<br>also by one another and<br>one of the things i think was very<br>instrumental<br>in new zealand doing well and perhaps<br>better than some other countries were<br>our stocks of social capital that is the<br>trust<br>that we have in each other and the trust<br>we have in our institutions<br>including in government however as<br>you'll see from the slide there<br>the well-being of new zealanders is<br>experienced unevenly<br>and particularly those who are sole<br>parents unemployed<br>if you're maori or pacifica in terms of<br>your health or education<br>um or other social outcomes that is not<br>as good as the rest of the population<br>and so that knowledge about the<br>unevenness of well-being in new zealand<br>influences what we then invest in and<br>you'll certainly see in a few moments<br>when i go through<br>the main areas of investment in the<br>budget how how understanding of new<br>zealand's well-being<br>impacts how we put our budgets together<br>if we go to the next slide and then the<br>so that's a brief slide there on the gdp<br>and we can go to the unemployment one<br>that's next<br>um just to show that um we are better<br>off than we thought<br>so what you see there on the<br>unemployment chart is where we were<br>projected to be in terms of unemployment<br>at this time and that was at around just<br>under 10<br>the good news is we've peaked up just<br>over five percent and then now come down<br>to about<br>4.7 that is a very good result relative<br>to the rest of the world it's an<br>extremely good result with the oecd<br>average for unemployment being up over<br>six percent<br>um we think that a significant part of<br>this was the wage subsidy scheme<br>which meant that people stayed in work<br>uh precipitous decisions weren't made<br>about laying people off and that cash<br>flow and confidence that went with the<br>wage subsidy scheme<br>then in turn allowed people to recover<br>better<br>at the same time new zealand's exports<br>have continued to do very well<br>and so the new zealand economy is<br>actually now<br>operating at a level about where it was<br>before covert in terms of activity<br>that's a pretty remarkable result given<br>the hit that the new zealand economy<br>experienced if we just go on past the<br>intro slide to the first chart<br>um so what you'll see there is for for<br>gdp which is the traditional measure we<br>use for economic activity<br>you'll see what's essentially a pretty<br>um standard v-shaped recovery an<br>enormous shock<br>to the new zealand economy through 2020<br>and in covert<br>and then a big bounce back what you'll<br>also see at the end of that chart is<br>some pretty significant volatility<br>and i think that's one of my overarching<br>messages is that there isn't a<br>economic forecast document that i get<br>that doesn't have<br>some words like uncertainty or<br>volatility in it<br>the rest of the world's dealing with<br>coverts still we're not all fully aware<br>of the full economic impact let alone<br>the health impact<br>and so you're going to see charts with<br>with um<br>quite a bit of of that kind of movement<br>in them as<br>we get a bit more certainty but the good<br>news there is that um we're forecasting<br>uh<br>gdp growth to average out at about three<br>and a half percent<br>over the forecast period that is a very<br>solid and sound result for that<br>particular measure<br>if we go to the next slide please jane<br>as i said unemployment um the reason<br>that there's a spider appeared on the<br>chart there is that<br>treasury actually finalized its<br>unemployment forecasts before we got<br>the latest data and so we're already<br>ahead of where the treasury thought we<br>would be<br>at that time this time and you can see<br>the trend back down towards four percent<br>for unemployment again a very good<br>result<br>given the circumstances next slide<br>thanks jane<br>um so this is the slide that measures um<br>what's called the obergell<br>which is what's commonly when people<br>talk about this in the media<br>talks about our deficit or our surplus<br>so this is the the year to year<br>where we're at in terms of our spending<br>um you'll see that obviously<br>um the deficit caused by the very large<br>amount of debt we had to take on and the<br>amount of money we needed to spend<br>does begin to reduce significantly and<br>by the end of our four year period we're<br>just<br>about getting back into surplus and if<br>we were to extend this chart out<br>to 2627 in our projection period you<br>would see that we'd be back in surplus<br>um we're not going to try to get our<br>books back into surplus<br>ahead of where the economy and society<br>is<br>so if we were to try to take measures to<br>get back to surplus within one or two<br>years<br>that would require us to significantly<br>reduce the spending and the investment<br>that we need to be making<br>to support strong public services and to<br>help people get through covert<br>the kind of approach that would take you<br>back there much quicker is<br>often referred to as austerity measures<br>and the government simply isn't prepared<br>to do that we don't think<br>that would be the right thing for the<br>long-term uh benefit of society or the<br>economy so<br>we have a gradual return to surplus uh<br>around about on the same time<br>scale as the previous government did<br>when uh the global financial crisis<br>next slide thanks jane um there's quite<br>a lot in this slide but this is a slide<br>that depicts where our net<br>debt track is um similar point to the<br>one i've just made that<br>we are heading back we pick up indeed um<br>and around the 2023 year<br>and then we begin to come off this is<br>the debt we've taken on in order to get<br>us all through covert i'm<br>i 100 stand by the decision that we<br>needed to make to borrow this money<br>we do need to begin to uh you know<br>return our levels of debt back to<br>lower levels than than we are at the<br>moment but again that will be a gradual<br>exercise in order to<br>protect our social services and protect<br>the supports that we've put in place<br>next slide thanks jane now it's not a<br>competition<br>but if you were to compare us to<br>australia<br>who brought their budget out just a<br>little bit before hours you'll see on<br>the indicator there on gdp<br>on employment and on unemployment that<br>new zealanders<br>is going ahead of where australia is and<br>if we go to the next slide jane<br>also on debt and on our operating<br>balance<br>australia measures net debt differently<br>to new zealand but if we use<br>their measure um we end up at a<br>significantly lower level<br>than they are at so as i say not a<br>competition but just a slide to<br>illustrate that<br>we are doing pretty well relative to<br>those countries we often choose to<br>compare ourselves to<br>all of this means uh that we've been<br>able to do two things in this budget<br>that i was not confident when i was<br>beginning to put it together that we<br>would be able to do we're able to see<br>those levels of debt and deficit come<br>down<br>but we're also increasing our spending<br>and that's both and what we're doing and<br>what's called operating spending the<br>day-to-day expenditure that we do<br>and capital spending the buildings and<br>the infrastructure and so on<br>so we've increased both of those at the<br>same time<br>as being able to bring down and bring<br>the deficit down<br>that's the balance i've been talking<br>about home it's a good tribute to the<br>strength of the new zealand economy that<br>we've been able to do there<br>next slide thanks june so<br>for this tomb of government the<br>government has the three priorities that<br>you see there the first of those is<br>continuing<br>to keep alterato new zealand safe from<br>covert 19.<br>um clearly the threat of government 19<br>is with us and those of us in wellington<br>know that more than anyone else at the<br>moment and that i will come back to that<br>at the end of my presentation but that<br>remains an important<br>element of our work the budget however<br>focuses on the second and third<br>priorities<br>accelerating our recovery and rebuild<br>and getting on to addressing the big<br>long-term foundational issues we have<br>climate change in particular housing<br>and child wellbeing go to the next slide<br>in the next one uh and so as i say that<br>gives you an idea of the overall amount<br>of spending the<br>new spending that you're going to see<br>over this forecast four year period<br>just a little note there of the bottom<br>bullet point that we have kept<br>back 5.1 billion dollars from our covert<br>response and recovery fund<br>uh in order to make sure should there be<br>a significant resurgence<br>and we had to pay out something like the<br>wage subsidy or what's called our new<br>resurgence support payment uh that we<br>have money put aside um to do that<br>next slide thanks jane um so you would<br>have heard<br>probably in it's been a little while<br>since the budget now you would have<br>heard quite a bit<br>about the first of the priorities uh<br>highlights rather on that<br>uh table there the lifting of benefits<br>was a really significant<br>and important part of this budget<br>we made the decision that having<br>established something called the wealthy<br>expert advisory group<br>that uh it was very clear in the advice<br>that they gave us the value of<br>main benefits had slipped significantly<br>below<br>levels that we would be comfortable for<br>people being able to live their lives<br>with<br>a sense of dignity and so that's why we<br>have increased benefits by what are very<br>large amounts of per week amounts<br>uh that you see on the ta on the um<br>slide there<br>given that there's been so much focus<br>and attention on that in the period<br>after the budget i'm not going to talk<br>so much about it today<br>other than to make a point that in<br>addition to supporting those who are on<br>very low incomes<br>this also has the effect of continuing<br>to stimulate the economy<br>because around about three billion<br>dollars extra is is now<br>going to be in the economy with these<br>benefit rates increasing and that money<br>gets spent<br>in the communities in which those people<br>live and so that acts to support small<br>businesses and others<br>uh to be able to uh operate um in this<br>in this covert era<br>we go on to the next slide and i'll work<br>through uh those core issues so housing<br>remains one of our biggest<br>um issues the government made a number<br>of announcements in march around our<br>attempt to try and really<br>get on top of the housing crisis and<br>those have been funded<br>uh in the budget i just note that<br>there's a mixture here of<br>of funding to help others build houses<br>and funding for the government itself<br>to build houses and this is a has to be<br>a long-term<br>series of commitments and there's a<br>particular focus on maori housing<br>uh because we know that home ownership<br>rates for maori are significantly lower<br>than the rest of the population and this<br>starts to come back to some of that<br>well-being work that i mentioned earlier<br>next slide thanks gene<br>clearly climate change in dealing with<br>the government's<br>role in supporting our transition to a<br>low-carbon economy<br>is critical and this will now be a<br>feature of budgets from here onwards<br>the first point's one that um only<br>really those who are very focused on the<br>way the government does its accounting<br>perhaps would see the significance of<br>but we have made a commitment that the<br>money that we get from the emissions<br>trading scheme<br>which is the the scheme to trade carbon<br>credits uh that was set up many years<br>ago now that revenue will now all get<br>recycled<br>into programs that reduce our carbon and<br>other emissions<br>it is really important we give certainty<br>and a decent<br>funding pathway to be able to support<br>what is a big shift<br>for the new zealand economy and then<br>below there you'll see a number of<br>initiatives one of which<br>since um the slide was created has now<br>been announced<br>and that is the clean car discount the<br>incentive program<br>to get more low emissions vehicles on<br>the road<br>we simply will not meet our climate<br>change objectives<br>unless we take significant action in the<br>next two to three years<br>around how we reduce our emissions<br>across sectors ranging from agriculture<br>through to transport<br>through to the way that we heat our<br>different industrial plants<br>through to the energy efficiency of our<br>homes all of those are dealt within the<br>initiatives there but there will have to<br>be more and significantly more<br>investment in this area<br>over the next couple of budgets and then<br>the third if we go to the next slide<br>um the third on so<br>the third issue is the child wellbeing<br>one which i dealt with before<br>in terms of the other part of the<br>priorities around accelerating our<br>recovery<br>the big focus here is a boost to our<br>productivity<br>and the way we've taken one major step<br>towards that<br>is our investment in infrastructure and<br>so the chart there shows you<br>um the investments that we're going to<br>be making we are significantly<br>interested in how we can lift our<br>performance not only in transport<br>but also housing the educational<br>facilities health facilities<br>and really what we're doing here is<br>laying out a pipeline of funding that<br>the government's providing<br>to give certainty to the people who<br>actually do the building we<br>need infrastructure to be developed more<br>to improve our productivity so our<br>cities are less congested uh that we've<br>got high quality<br>facilities for us to provide our public<br>services in and so<br>this is a very significant boost to that<br>investment<br>next slide thanks a number of other<br>areas we're doing that particularly in<br>the area of rail<br>rail is a great investment because not<br>only does it reduce emissions by getting<br>uh trucks off the road but also supports<br>job creation<br>um and particularly good in areas like<br>apprenticeships and so a big boost<br>to our rail there and then continuing to<br>support those sectors<br>who have been affected by covert<br>particularly tourism but also our small<br>businesses<br>and listening to small businesses that<br>really what they want to support<br>uh to get online and be trading online<br>um some some continuing boosts into<br>training and skills which are a really<br>important part<br>of um productivity and in particular a<br>real focus around what we call<br>vocational education<br>so this is the trade training work that<br>we've done we've made apprenticeships<br>and trade training free and we're seeing<br>a lot more people going into that<br>but we need to continue to boost that<br>and support those who are currently out<br>of work<br>and being able to get further<br>qualifications at the same time we're<br>doing some big work to reform<br>particularly the resource management act<br>and the way we manage<br>water within our cities and towns in new<br>zealand all of that's about improving<br>our productivity lifting the value of<br>what we do<br>and in creating more high-paying jobs<br>next slide thanks june um as in every<br>budget health<br>is a big part of the investments we make<br>and<br>we are completely reforming our health<br>system we're getting rid of the dhbs<br>there's investment in this budget to do<br>that but at the same time while we're in<br>that process of reform we've got to<br>continue<br>to make sure that health services are<br>offered and that's the funding<br>that you see on the chart there as well<br>as a real focus around pharmac where<br>clearly there are calls for even more<br>investment than what we have made but<br>you'll see that we feel we've<br>boosted that budget significantly over<br>recent years and then a range of other<br>health initiatives including the ones<br>that were announced just before the<br>budget<br>around improvements for cancer screening<br>next slide thanks<br>continuing to invest in education and<br>the last term in government chris<br>hipkins the minister of education<br>set off a number of reform processes<br>including around nca<br>which i'm sure many of the students<br>would be interested in the change<br>program there and we have<br>listened to students voices in that<br>process as well as a big investment<br>in maori and pacific education and<br>making sure that we particularly are<br>able to expand opportunities<br>for pacific language learning but also<br>today on maori as well<br>next slide thanks as i said i wanted<br>just to come back to keeping new<br>zealanders safe from covert 19.<br>the vaccine rollout is one of the most<br>important things that we can do<br>and we put aside more than one and a<br>half billion dollars actually now<br>to make sure that the vaccine program<br>rolls out well<br>we are very confident that we have<br>enough doses available for all new<br>zealanders who want to get the two doses<br>free of charge to get them by the end of<br>the year and the reason for that<br>is because we have a delivery schedule<br>with pfizer<br>who are the provider of that vaccine so<br>everyone will get one you'll see some<br>stories at the moment where people are<br>concerned about whether<br>they can get their booking right now but<br>everybody will be able to get access and<br>since<br>the budget and since these slides were<br>created that includes 12 to 16 year olds<br>and that's a really important<br>step forward the clinical trials have<br>now been done in the u.s and elsewhere<br>and we're aware that um that that<br>opportunity is an important one<br>for lifting the immunity of new<br>zealanders so the work program on how<br>that will happen is happening now but<br>your schools<br>and also when your family other family<br>members are getting vaccinated<br>we're now going to be in a position for<br>12 to 16 year olds to get there too<br>so a little bit of paperwork to be done<br>before that rolls out fully<br>so you'll hear a bit more about that<br>over the coming weeks<br>and we continue obviously with our<br>managed isolation quarantine and border<br>work<br>it is so important that new zealanders<br>do get vaccinated it's not compulsory<br>but we really need all new zealanders<br>who can and are willing to do so<br>to step forward because that's what will<br>allow us to begin to open up our borders<br>a bit more and<br>see life look a little bit more like it<br>did before covert<br>came along but we won't get there<br>without a vaccination program and we<br>need<br>everybody's help in that and just i<br>think the last couple of slides<br>uh now um jane the next one<br>um is an interesting idea that's emerged<br>as a lesson from covet<br>we found that one of the things we had<br>to do just as the previous government<br>had had to do after the canopy<br>earthquakes<br>was provide some emergency support for<br>people who lost their jobs very suddenly<br>they lost their jobs suddenly they still<br>had outgoings<br>that were commensurate with with what<br>income they had previously had<br>and to avoid the economic scarring the<br>potential of people having to sell<br>houses<br>and and and uproot their families and so<br>on<br>we're proposing a scheme that runs in a<br>lot of other countries which is a social<br>insurance scheme<br>that would support people at 80 percent<br>is<br>okay everyone just a slight interruption<br>while grant's uh<br>computer is being re-established<br>are you able to see us grant uh you<br>think<br>you can hear me i suspect yes we can<br>hear you and we can see you<br>yeah good oh i can't see you so just<br>right interesting that was a<br>technological moment<br>for us all there um all right<br>so um as i said yeah that that um that<br>scheme is common in a lot of other<br>countries in the world<br>and we're um we're looking to develop<br>that in<br>consultation with uh business new<br>zealand and the council of trade unions<br>over the next little while and the final<br>slide we go there jane<br>um so in summary this really is a budget<br>set in the shadow of covert um we are<br>trying to<br>to develop a series of initiatives that<br>get on top of<br>the big issues of our time around<br>housing around child poverty and climate<br>change<br>but we want to do that in a balanced way<br>that creates jobs<br>uh keeps our fiscal position strong and<br>the hopefully unlikely event<br>of further disruptions to the economy<br>such as covert and so<br>for us it's a budget which had that<br>balance in mind and obviously it's up to<br>the people of<br>new zealand as to whether they feel we<br>got their balance right<br>so jane i'll leave it there and i'm very<br>happy to answer whatever questions<br>great thank you very much grant that was<br>a great overview of the budget which<br>obviously took a lot more time to<br>prepare than it did to present<br>and so people that are here online with<br>us<br>live if you want to type in any<br>questions please go ahead and do that<br>in the interim i have some questions<br>that were already sent in by a couple of<br>schools<br>so i'll just pose some of those to you<br>grant on their behalf<br>so first we had a question from<br>wellington girls college from jessica<br>how much do you think the spending<br>commitment we had to make on covert<br>will change the government's fiscal<br>planning in new zealand<br>now and in years to come yeah<br>it's a really good question geezer and i<br>covered some of that in the presentation<br>um clearly when you're needing to take<br>on extra dip<br>to the extent that we did it's going to<br>have a big impact we measure that depth<br>in a couple of different ways<br>the main way we measure it is as a<br>percentage of the economy overall as a<br>percentage of gdp<br>and and in that on that score we've gone<br>from about 19<br>and we're projected to peak up in the<br>mid 40<br>area so that's a massive increase in<br>dollar terms that's going to turn out to<br>be<br>a good hundred million dollars extra<br>than what we had 100 billion sorry<br>dollars extra<br>than what we had um intended to um<br>borrow and so that has to have a big<br>impact<br>as i said before the way we're looking<br>at it is<br>we will reduce that debt over time<br>because we want to bring ourselves back<br>to a position that were we needing<br>at some point in the future to increase<br>that we had the the room to do that<br>the treasury tell us that um in a crisis<br>the new zealand economy can sustain<br>something between<br>um 50 and 60 net debt<br>um and then come back down from there so<br>we haven't got as high as that which is<br>a good thing<br>but we do want to see it consolidate<br>down as i said before um there are some<br>people who<br>who are advocating for us to move much<br>more quickly back<br>to that um position with those lower<br>levels of debt uh but our viewers in<br>order to do that we would have to stop<br>a lot of very important programs that<br>we've got and we're just not prepared to<br>do that<br>the really i guess the other really<br>important thing is that when we compare<br>ourselves to the rest of the<br>world and we're in a much stronger<br>position on debt<br>so my british equivalent the person who<br>does my job in the united kingdom<br>produced a budget a month or two<br>before mine and he had 100<br>net debt in his budget so other<br>countries who<br>went into this um crisis in a more<br>difficult position than we did are<br>really struggling<br>um with with their repayment so diet is<br>a really important<br>uh position um for people to be able to<br>think about<br>but it's got to be balanced okay<br>grant we've got a couple of um questions<br>that have appeared online you can see<br>those yeah yep so i can<br>work my way through those and yeah and<br>then one other one if you like sure<br>um so in terms of the question is um why<br>have we not implemented the full benefit<br>recommendations of the welfare advisory<br>group<br>um we've certainly taken on board<br>the major ones that that we have seen um<br>the first of those<br>were the largest of those sorry was the<br>increases to main benefit rates that<br>we've indicated<br>in addition to that we had already done<br>some of the other<br>recommendations such as indexing uh<br>benefits to the average wage and that<br>will make a big increase<br>as we move move forward that rather than<br>benefits being<br>having to be increased by a specific<br>decision we can simply do that<br>in line and we've made changes around<br>what's called the abatement rate<br>which allows people to keep more of<br>their income before their benefit<br>reduces<br>they keep more of income they earn from<br>working before their benefit begins to<br>reduce which is a really important way<br>of<br>supporting people back into some other<br>types of work<br>reinstated the training incentive<br>allowance which is another<br>recommendation<br>which is about giving support to people<br>on benefit to undertake<br>degree level qualifications there are<br>still one or two<br>changes that we haven't yet looked at<br>and we're working our way through those<br>but our view is<br>that we're taking the most significant<br>steps we can at the moment<br>and the welfare expert advisory group<br>remains their report remains<br>uh the blueprint for us that we will<br>continue to look at<br>how we can go ahead with the other<br>recommendations that have not yet been<br>uh<br>implemented jacob has a question saying<br>in comparison with<br>uh 2021 but last year's budget um he's<br>asking why has there been a four million<br>dollar increase in budget money<br>allocated towards the provision<br>purchase and support of health and<br>disability services are provided by<br>maori for maori<br>especially when reports have shown that<br>maori pacific people's recorded lower<br>life satisfaction<br>health and access to education services<br>jacob um i think what you've hit on here<br>is<br>is really in essence the way we do some<br>of the accounting and the budget<br>so where money is provided for a<br>specific service or a specific purchase<br>and not all of that money is used in a<br>particular<br>year sometimes the decision is made to<br>return what's called returning that<br>money to the centre<br>so basically the money was allocated but<br>it wasn't all<br>um spent or utilized in a year and then<br>the portion that wasn't used comes back<br>in actual fact the budget significantly<br>increases the amount of money available<br>for health and disability services<br>going forward and especially those for<br>by maori foreign<br>and in particular what this year's<br>budget does<br>is that it puts in place the building<br>blocks for the new<br>maori health authority and that will<br>provide a great deal<br>of more impetus and support behind by<br>maori for maori solutions and health<br>it will be able and it's in fact funded<br>in part in the budget to commission its<br>own<br>health services we know that maori<br>health outcomes are poorer<br>than the rest of the population and<br>we're really excited about now having a<br>vehicle by which to focus in<br>to get those interventions right but in<br>a sense that four million dollars was<br>really<br>just moving from an annual allocation<br>back into the<br>central pool but there is an increase in<br>funding in programs to support maori<br>health outcomes if i scroll<br>up so daisy if i scroll down my list<br>here<br>um the question how will the money<br>allocated to scott base be used and what<br>issues is it directed towards i'm<br>really impressed that people are reading<br>the detail of the budget so that's<br>fantastic<br>um that's uh a rebuild of scott base<br>so scott base is new zealand's um home<br>in in antarctica it's been there for a<br>long time<br>and it's in desperate need of of a<br>complete change and so this will rebuild<br>the base<br>not only to be a safe and secure place<br>for those new zealanders<br>who are on antarctica but also to<br>rebuild it as a<br>higher quality research facility so<br>there'll be laboratory space there'll be<br>space for other researchers to be able<br>to use<br>when they go down to antarctica around<br>about 300 million<br>dollar redevelopment and the other<br>benefit that it has it'll be new zealand<br>firms that will be doing the building<br>there's a particular firm<br>based out of christchurch that's got a<br>bit of experience building down on the<br>ice because um<br>it's a bit different from doing building<br>projects elsewhere and so<br>it'll create a large number of jobs over<br>the next few years<br>next question from tower college is um<br>how am i going to limit the effects of<br>the three billion dollars in extra<br>spending<br>as an injection into the economy on<br>inflation so this is a really good<br>question around<br>where we are in terms of the stimulus<br>that we want<br>in our economy because when we looked at<br>where we were about a year ago<br>nobody was at all concerned or worried<br>about inflation we were just worried<br>about making sure that the economy kept<br>operating and jobs kept being created<br>at the moment the economy is at capacity<br>in some areas so for example you might<br>have read<br>in the news uh people's comments about<br>um the supply of<br>of staff of labor because with the<br>borders shut<br>um you know and as the economy grows<br>faster than we expected<br>um we haven't necessarily got all the<br>people here we would normally have<br>um to do that work so there are labor<br>shortages we've also got some<br>real constraints around building<br>supplies and so on coming into new<br>zealand because<br>shipping routes have been disrupted by<br>covert and other issues<br>one of the reasons we think the support<br>into benefits is good because<br>that's a consumption-led stimulus so it<br>means that<br>it's money that's being spent in small<br>businesses who could really do with it<br>overall in terms of the impact on<br>inflation three billion within the much<br>wider<br>um 300 billion new zealand economy is<br>small so in terms of its<br>single effect on inflation it will be<br>limited<br>but inflation more generally is forecast<br>by the treasury<br>to peak up somewhere around two and a<br>half percent before coming down again<br>uh bank economists more recently are<br>saying something more like three percent<br>inflation might be likely that's still<br>historically<br>low and sits around the band<br>that the reserve bank are obliged to try<br>and keep inflation out that's<br>between one and three percent so we<br>think that's manageable wages are also<br>forecast to go up by about three percent<br>across the forecast period too so some<br>level of inflation in the economy is to<br>be expected we've just had a period of<br>time where we've had<br>very very low inflation uh but we think<br>this is at a manageable level but in<br>particular in answer to the question<br>the three billion dollars we think<br>targets are a part of the economy that<br>could do with stimulus and relatively<br>speaking is is a bit lower than<br>uh sorry is is a small component to what<br>we do our regular questioner has a<br>couple more<br>and so um i mentioned the next budgets<br>we will invest in climate change<br>solutions<br>my question is why not tackle this issue<br>in this budget well we are<br>it's just that there will be a great<br>deal more focus on that in the next two<br>budgets so i had a slide earlier which<br>had<br>a number of the initiatives we are<br>taking in this budget<br>including our green investment fund<br>where we partner with the private sector<br>on<br>new technological investments to reduce<br>emissions<br>and the support that we're giving to our<br>healthy homes program to insulate homes<br>making the public sector carbon neutral<br>by 2025<br>so the big investments there too but one<br>of the reasons was we put the budget<br>together before we got the final report<br>of the independent climate commission<br>and that report<br>has given us a very clear stare on what<br>are called our carbon budgets so what we<br>need to do to reduce<br>emissions across different sectors and<br>so that's why the next two budgets<br>will focus more on that now that we've<br>got uh the final answers there but as<br>you saw<br>we're we're moving as quickly and<br>swiftly as we can with things like the<br>clean car discount<br>uh but it's much more a signal that the<br>next two badgers will have even more<br>uh investment and then the last question<br>i've got there in front of me is around<br>uh what part of the budget will be<br>allocated to hospitals and the need for<br>more nurses and nurses um<br>being able to perform well you know as i<br>mentioned a massive increase in in<br>health spending in this budget<br>about 4.7 billion dollars on an annual<br>basis we're now spending 45 percent<br>more um in the health area than annually<br>than when we came in<br>to government in 20 late 2017 so we are<br>really really boosting spending there in<br>terms of specifically the nurses we've<br>got<br>i think it's about 3 000 more nursing<br>places in place<br>and then when we came into government<br>not all of those have been<br>filled yet because of again some of the<br>issues around the borders and<br>immigration<br>as you'll know we're in a negotiation at<br>the moment with the nurses about their<br>latest pay round<br>having done a pretty big boost in 2018<br>it's now time for another negotiation<br>part of that negotiation is actually the<br>conditions<br>in which nurses work and we're trying to<br>create what we call safe staffing levels<br>for nurses not all dhbs have met those<br>yet and that is pretty disappointing to<br>all of us<br>and kind of indicates one of the many<br>reasons why we want to reform the health<br>system<br>and and get rid of the dhbs and move to<br>a model where we can get<br>more consistency around the country<br>around for example<br>the way in which we do support nurses so<br>we are in a pay negotiation so you'll<br>hear a bit about that<br>uh but that doesn't take away from the<br>fact that we're very committed to<br>investing in health and making sure that<br>happy to inject new questions in<br>do you want to do your one um yes i've<br>got a couple here from st<br>patrick's silver stream which i'm keen<br>that we cover off given they sent them<br>in<br>so um uh one<br>from will who is a year 13 um<br>economics student at st patrick's silver<br>stream and he's got two questions one is<br>um they're both related to housing do<br>you intend to balance the inflation<br>gains of<br>homeowners against the interests of<br>young people who are being shut out of<br>the housing market<br>yeah look we made a number of<br>announcements in<br>march around what we were trying to do<br>on housing<br>our focus is not so much on into on<br>those who are owner occupiers of housing<br>but those who use housing as an<br>investment and so<br>our focus there is as you might have<br>heard is to remove the ability of people<br>to be able to<br>deduct their interest costs on uh<br>the borrowing they do for an investment<br>property so not the<br>home that they live in but about the<br>homes that they might rent out<br>and effectively people have been running<br>this in many ways as a business<br>and we think that that's led to<br>speculation because there's been a tax<br>advantage there<br>so we're removing that tax advantage we<br>do however want to see more homes built<br>because we are we have an enormous<br>shortage at the moment<br>and so we are retaining that takes<br>advantage if you're building a new<br>property<br>um so that we're adding to the housing<br>stock<br>we think that will make a difference in<br>terms of tilting the market towards<br>first-time<br>buyers and also in the budget we've<br>increased the support we give to<br>first-time buyers who<br>are gathering a deposit together and how<br>we can help more<br>people into their first time so that's<br>the focus we chose rather than looking<br>specifically at all<br>homeowners and an owner occupier owners<br>um<br>you know i recognize it it's harder and<br>harder for<br>younger people particularly to get into<br>housing unfortunately we didn't build<br>houses at the rate we needed to over the<br>last<br>couple of decades we are playing catch<br>up there but<br>um we are as a government building more<br>houses than<br>than any government since the 1970s and<br>and the funds and support programs we<br>put in<br>which i mentioned earlier we'll see more<br>houses built by the private sector too<br>but<br>house building does take time and so<br>it'll take us a while to get back<br>to all of that a related question from<br>will was that student allowances and<br>benefits are being increased as per the<br>budget however<br>is this an effective economic policy in<br>the face of<br>saturated and very responsive housing<br>market<br>will this not simply increase the price<br>level of housing<br>yeah i mean i don't know about the<br>prices of houses but there has<br>been concern expressed that it would um<br>be passed on immediately by landlords in<br>terms of increased rents<br>which is i think what will is getting at<br>with that question um<br>the evidence when previously we've<br>increased things like allowances and<br>benefits is actually<br>it doesn't increase rents by any more<br>than rents would normally<br>uh be increasing anyway and we're just<br>waiting to see where the data<br>comes through in the next few months but<br>i think it was just yesterday we saw<br>trademe's rental data<br>come out that showed that there hadn't<br>actually been a spike in rents as a<br>result<br>of some of the policies that we<br>announced uh that that basically<br>flatlined<br>um where where they are they've been in<br>the last few months so<br>the evidence doesn't back up that i know<br>it's a kind of<br>an assertion that people make is that<br>it'll automatically go into rents going<br>up<br>so we keep an eye on that um there are a<br>variety of things that can be done about<br>that<br>if rents are increased beyond the market<br>rate it's possible for the tenancy<br>tribunal to intervene<br>at that point to make sure they're not<br>and we've also changed the law so you<br>can only increase<br>rent once a year in a property that is<br>rented out to try and<br>control some of the changes that people<br>make there<br>okay um i think um the other question<br>from<br>pats you've answered because it was<br>really about<br>do you think the 3.8 billion being put<br>into housing acceleration fund could<br>become the solution to the ongoing<br>housing crisis and if so how it'll<br>certainly help<br>but there is no silver bullet when it<br>comes to housing but<br>the biggest issue raised with us by<br>local government and by private sector<br>developers<br>is access to what they call build ready<br>land so that's land that's got the pipes<br>and the drains and the roads associated<br>with it<br>so that they can get on with building<br>the houses and quite small amounts of<br>money put in by the government can<br>unleash<br>a large number of houses being built and<br>so we do think that fund will be really<br>really important<br>if i go back to the list um jacob's got<br>another question around whether we're<br>ready to respond to another resurgence<br>look as i said in the presentation jacob<br>yes i believe we are<br>we've kept money aside should we need it<br>for resurgence we're obviously<br>hopeful that our vaccination program<br>will see a reduction in the likelihood<br>of resurgences<br>as you know new zealand took a different<br>approach than other countries<br>and focused on vaccinating our border<br>workforce and our health workforce first<br>because that's where the greatest risk<br>of infection actually lay for us<br>other countries we're dealing with<br>community<br>infections in there when they were doing<br>vaccination and so they focused in a<br>different way<br>but we put resources aside if it's<br>needed um to be able to deal with that<br>and then tawa college is back asking if<br>in the budget i've taken a cost benefit<br>analysis of opening the travel bubble<br>with australia with the economic effects<br>from a lockdown or high alert levels<br>um and does the benefit of increased<br>productivity from workers matter<br>i think it's a really interesting<br>question i mean in terms of cost benefit<br>analysis<br>i mean quite clearly it's it's it's<br>actually quite a complex<br>analysis because cost benefit you really<br>have to put risk<br>as the main thing that you're looking at<br>here so the strong advice we had from<br>our health officials was that<br>given the way that australia had managed<br>the pandemic which was very similar<br>to the way that new zealand had managed<br>the pandemic that we could<br>manage the risk of there being<br>outbreaks um we've now had our first<br>example<br>of that in wellington at the moment uh<br>the treasury model<br>would tell you that um if wellington was<br>at level two<br>for seven days or so that would cost<br>about 10 million dollars to the<br>wellington economy<br>we know that the number of visitors<br>who've come into new zealand and the<br>benefit that<br>that we've got from that from australia<br>as well and truly exceeded that<br>um already so that is within the<br>calculations but we primarily made our<br>calculation<br>on the basis of public health and the<br>fact that that we felt this was<br>manageable<br>and um so far it has been but obviously<br>if we saw<br>very very significant outbreaks that<br>would cause us to rethink<br>uh all of our settings we're not<br>expecting that<br>we have good relationships with<br>right i think that's all the questions<br>and we're just about<br>up to time as well so<br>um i would just like to<br>first of all thank um the honorable<br>grant robertson<br>very much for giving up your time today<br>grant you we've probably eaten your<br>entire lunch hour for you<br>assuming you have one as a
