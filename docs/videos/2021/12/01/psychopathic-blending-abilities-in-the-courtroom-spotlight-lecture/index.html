How can we uncover the true speaker or writer behind the disguise? Forensic linguistics considers aspects of language that are “below the radar”—that is, aspects of language that most people don’t realise tend to pattern in a certain way for speakers and writers. When forensic linguists analyse spoken or written text, we peel back the obvious layers of superficial disguise to get to the subconscious patterning underneath. We are able to use natural language patterning to help us determine if we can take the speaker or author at face value, or if disguise is being attempted. If disguise is attempted, we can also use subconscious features of language patterning to uncover information about the person hidden beneath. This talk looks at some of the processes involved with uncovering deception in forensic linguistics and provides some real life examples of how this has been done. <br><br>Psychopathic blending abilities at court with Associate Professor Hedwig Eisenbarth: <br><br>Part of the description of psychopathic personality is an ability to manipulate and deceive people, as well as a tendency to lie. So what if someone scoring high on psychopathic personality is a defendant at court? Are they able to deceive the jury, impress the judge or just lie about the actions they are accused about? Would it matter if the jury knows about the defendant’s psychopathic personality scores? And how would the gender of the defendant play a role in the proceedings? While there might be some explanation for interpersonal manipulation through the concept of psychopathic personality, the ever more interesting question might be if the cold-hearted impression, and physiological calmness that is driving such an effect. This talk will highlight the known and unknown parts of this stereotype of psychopathy at court.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically

in<br>tahereh<br>university of wellington and i'm<br>interested in forensic psychology in the<br>broadest sense and<br>the how emotion<br>and interactions between people play a<br>role in the context of antisocial<br>behavior<br>my name is karen seals<br>and i am a senior lecturer of applied<br>linguistics<br>here at tejedangawaka victoria<br>university of wellington<br>originally from the u.s um but i have<br>lived here for a good long while now<br>and i have an interest in forensic<br>linguistics in the area which i have<br>trained and studied and and<br>actively work in as a forensic linguist<br>so um hedwig and i have a very exciting<br>double presentation for you today to<br>all right i'll take it for the start so<br>the first thing to launch us off<br>hedwig and i will be speaking today<br>about deception and about two takes on<br>deception one perspective from forensic<br>linguistics and one from forensic<br>psychology<br>so my area is in forensic linguistics as<br>i mentioned so we'll take a jump start<br>into this looking at how we can uncover<br>deception through a forensic linguistics<br>approach<br>we'll begin with a case<br>in october 2009<br>seventeen-year-old ashley hall of the<br>united kingdom went missing<br>her body was later found in a remote<br>area near her home<br>police discovered that she had been on<br>her way to a date with a boy she'd been<br>texting with and talking to on facebook<br>these are her last known text messages<br>that we know for sure were written by<br>her you see there are some back and<br>forth between ashley and peter also<br>between ashley and peter stad who<br>entered the conversation at one point<br>we'll not spend too much time on this<br>but i'm happy to share these at any<br>point in the future if anyone's keen you<br>what arose as a question however were<br>these two texts<br>that seemed to have come in around the<br>time she died so one of the questions<br>that investigators had<br>was were these messages written by<br>ashley or were they written by someone<br>else<br>i'm going to fast forward now to that<br>as you see this was the the question the<br>q texts the questioned texts were they<br>written by ashley or by someone else<br>the finding was that peter and his<br>father were the same person<br>they were peter chapman age 32 who is a<br>sex offender with multiple convictions<br>dr john olson who is a very well-known<br>forensic linguist in the in the united<br>kingdom analyzed the text using forensic<br>linguistics and was able to determine<br>that those q-texts the questioned ones<br>were sent by peter chapman using<br>ashley's phone<br>in order to keep suspicion away and<br>peter chapman when confronted with this<br>evidence did admit ashley's murder and<br>was convicted in 2010 and sentenced to<br>35 years to life in prison<br>so forensic linguistics has a real life<br>um<br>it's able to be applied to real life and<br>be quite helpful for that one of the<br>questions that i often get though is<br>when you<br>are given a text or a bit of speech or<br>one of many many things that can be<br>analyzed through forensic linguistics<br>how do you know how to begin<br>in all cases<br>one of the things that<br>i usually ask for is to find um<br>if there's a question of authorship or<br>speaker identity i ask for items where<br>the person is known that they did those<br>and then to be able to compare those to<br>a document that is in question<br>so an example of this where we can<br>compare linguistic features across text<br>is if we have documents with a known<br>writer which we call kdox for known<br>then for example if in those documents<br>the person we know who wrote those<br>documents always uses there spelled<br>t-h-e-r-e<br>for any instance that could be any of<br>the grammatical theirs such as<br>t-a-t-e-i-r t-h-e-y apostrophe re or<br>t-h-e-r-e<br>and then we have a question document<br>with an unknown writer<br>and that person always<br>accurately uses<br>those grammatical<br>items throughout<br>if that was the only linguistic element<br>that mattered then we could surmise that<br>they were likely different people it was<br>not the same person who wrote them<br>however it's not that simple<br>there are many many linguistic elements<br>we consider both in speech and in text<br>when<br>doing an analysis<br>so some of the other elements that are<br>considered are things like<br>sociolinguistic variation also analysis<br>of the discourse both of those are very<br>systematic procedures and linguistics<br>that we can apply for the purposes of<br>forensic linguistics<br>sometimes we might linguistically answer<br>the question why does it sound different<br>and we'll look at those items but we<br>could also look at things like<br>phonology and phonetics so the sounds<br>and our words pronounce differently<br>also are different lexical items used so<br>the individual words<br>is the variation in spelling also one of<br>my favorites is syntactic complexity so<br>how complex<br>are the structures within sentences so<br>that's something that's really under the<br>radar<br>that patterns in a very interesting very<br>specific way and people have a very<br>difficult time convincingly<br>hiding<br>who they are when you analyze things<br>through syntactic complexity<br>and just a point of note forensic<br>linguistics is not the same as<br>handwriting analysis we don't do that<br>sometimes i have people ask me to do<br>that it's it's not that it's a<br>scientific approach to analyzing how<br>so discourse analysis is one of the key<br>items we use and for that we're looking<br>at form and function in discourse so<br>what was said how was it said what was<br>the function of this what was implied<br>was it considered successful in the<br>communicative event or not so how did<br>people respond<br>if it yeah if it was why if it was not<br>why not what sorts of clues are there in<br>the discourse so we pull it apart a bit<br>like a puzzle<br>we also look at variation and style<br>because we have options in what we say<br>every day some of them happen very<br>quickly and we don't even notice that<br>we're drawing upon<br>our most frequent usage other times we<br>think about which word is better or how<br>might i say this in a different way<br>those are all choices we make and those<br>choices matter<br>in forensic linguistics that also helps<br>us identify intent and also<br>characteristics of the author of the<br>text<br>to do this we analyze all possible<br>tokens of a linguistic feature even when<br>they don't occur could they have<br>occurred and if so what does it mean<br>that it could have occurred and doesn't<br>lots of questions going around with this<br>we also use corpus linguistics so we can<br>look at things like collocations so<br>words that appear together or as i<br>mentioned before syntactic structures<br>so some examples of this uh using the<br>internet looking at the subject pronoun<br>and past such as i was and m i am and<br>was<br>looking at how common different usages<br>are so this came from the book word<br>crime by john olson who i mentioned<br>earlier and this was a search he<br>conducted<br>and at that time you can see the<br>different frequencies that are here now<br>if someone used the structure i was an m<br>throughout that's quite common that's<br>what the database shows us so that's not<br>something that would point to any<br>particular individual by itself<br>however something like she is and was is<br>quite an uncommon structure to find so<br>that would be more likely to point to a<br>particular individual who might use that<br>frequently that would be a notable<br>but how do we account for deception so<br>all of this is talking about finding an<br>author and assuming that they're writing<br>as themselves but deception is the act<br>of misleading another person<br>intentionally through intentionally<br>false statements or fraudulent actions<br>so someone is trying to intentionally<br>hide themselves so how do we peel that<br>back<br>one of the things we do consider is that<br>speakers tend to shift their styles<br>towards their intended audience<br>so we need to be aware of who that<br>assumed audience is and speakers will<br>change their style and register for that<br>assumed audience now what's interesting<br>about that is that for fake authorship<br>cases the author will attempt to talk to<br>the audience how they think the<br>impersonated person would talk to that<br>audience so it's an assumption made of<br>how they think that person would do it<br>and they're trying to replicate that so<br>that's where we get that things often<br>pattern closely but not exactly as how<br>the actual person would do that<br>so that's one of the first signs for us<br>is things are showing up very near but<br>not exact<br>we also know from lots of research that<br>there are certain markers of deception<br>so for example when people are being<br>deceptive they usually either provide<br>fewer details or way too many details<br>they tend to make more negative<br>statements they tend to use more<br>language that is uncertain impersonal<br>evasive and unclear<br>and they tend to use more distancing<br>language<br>now distancing language looks kind of<br>like this these different things<br>so you might have<br>distancing through quotation<br>where if you have a direct quote such as<br>someone saying i remember him saying i<br>completely disagree with this decision<br>they're voicing that other person<br>which leads to greater distancing and<br>discourse because they're ascribing all<br>responsibility to someone else who's not<br>there<br>whereas indirect quotations such as i<br>remember him saying that he completely<br>disagrees with the this decision<br>is claiming some of the voicing of that<br>idea which leads to less distancing in<br>the discourse um cognitively as well<br>when we look at how language patterns<br>another distancing strategy is people<br>tend to use passive language so my<br>laptop was stolen yesterday<br>instead of so and so someone stole my<br>laptop yesterday<br>um also people tend to use them more<br>and<br>other groups of people so make them seem<br>like another such as those people always<br>steal<br>there's also a greater use of the third<br>person pronoun such as then she went<br>outside but there's no mention of i saw<br>her going outside that focuses on the<br>other person<br>also within the first person one that's<br>used me and my is much more distant than<br>i so it's that objectifying what you're<br>saying instead of remaining as the<br>subject so these are all distancing<br>features that we can look for within the<br>discourse<br>also there are two additional major<br>strategies that have been found to be<br>used in deceptive writing in particular<br>one is called being cooperatively vague<br>so being more verbose talking more about<br>the immediate actions happening the<br>immediate um<br>future<br>and also using more ambiguous speech<br>also there's impersonal disassociation<br>and depersonalization so using very<br>short clauses a very low use of<br>self-references<br>more use of the third person and agency<br>is attributed to someone else so much<br>purposeful ambiguity was one of the<br>things i mentioned and that's another<br>way a high marker of deception<br>these are three different types of<br>purposeful ambiguity one is using words<br>with multiple possible meanings<br>such as if someone asked did you leave a<br>message telling her that i already sent<br>her the file<br>and someone says she didn't get it<br>well she didn't get the message she<br>didn't get the file she didn't get what<br>so using words with multiple possible<br>meanings<br>also using an implied actor who's not<br>actually stated<br>so if someone says this text needs<br>defining<br>okay but who's meant to do that they're<br>not saying<br>or if someone says everything possible<br>has been done<br>okay who did<br>what what was done<br>also there's the maxim of relevance in<br>pragmatics which is that you respond in<br>a way that is directly relevant<br>to what someone else has said so<br>purposefully ambiguous discourse will<br>flout that maxim of relevance they won't<br>use it<br>such as where are you keeping the files<br>i've already told you all i can that's<br>not an answer to the question that's<br>actually another statement and it's<br>implied i'm not answering your question<br>but directly<br>all right let's look at another case<br>so this is a case i worked on<br>police contacted me about their concern<br>around a potential abuse case<br>a stepfather was arrested after a young<br>girl in primary school said he abused<br>her<br>the stepfather was then released on bail<br>police were given a handwritten letter<br>after this that the girl's mother said<br>was written by the girl<br>police questioned the validity of the<br>letter<br>and that's when i came in and i asked<br>for known documents as well as the<br>question documents so i was given five<br>known pieces of writing by the girl and<br>the questioned letter<br>there were two areas i just focus on as<br>this is a written case one was lexical<br>variation between and across text so<br>differences in word choice and word<br>usage<br>and another with syntactic complexity<br>how complex were the individual<br>sentences<br>however there was a quite unexpected<br>challenge that arose so this is one of<br>the tables that we use when doing the<br>sort of analysis the first column<br>are instances of the words in the<br>question document the second is<br>instances of<br>notable words or<br>misspellings or things you want to<br>expect occurring in the first<br>known document and then you get this<br>across the different known documents<br>now it's very very rare<br>that when you fill out the non-document<br>none of those things are occurring in<br>the question document<br>so that's an absence of comparative<br>elements but in absence does not mean<br>that you can conclude it's not the same<br>person it means you have to take a<br>different course of analysis<br>because you can't base a conclusion on<br>so instead i look to syntactic<br>complexity which is how complex are the<br>sentences that are being constructed and<br>in this case we're looking at sentences<br>so specific spellings are not they're<br>not relevant to the level of complexity<br>in the sentences themselves<br>so i use the syntactic complexity<br>analyzer and there's information there<br>for anyone who'd like to know more about<br>it<br>and i looked at things such as the mean<br>length of the sentence the mean length<br>of a t unit which is a core grammatical<br>clause and all the things around it that<br>are dependent on it<br>how many verb phrases there were per<br>t unit so number two and then also how<br>complex the nominals are for the t unit<br>which means how many independent noun<br>phrases can be found within that t unit<br>so i ran those and for anyone who likes<br>numbers you might see start to see that<br>there's a very interesting<br>pattern occurring<br>but for those who aren't as comfortable<br>with numbers here's a visual<br>so the dark blue on the right is the<br>question document each time<br>whereas the other three colors are the<br>known documents<br>now statistically<br>it there was a significance in the<br>difference<br>between<br>the q dots and what was happening there<br>versus all the k dots so the k dots were<br>patterning more or less<br>the same with some variation natural<br>variation that we would expect<br>but the q dots were happening more often<br>in particular for mean length of<br>sentence and mean length of t<br>unit so what's particularly interesting<br>you say okay so what so you've got this<br>we see there's a difference what's that<br>mean well we then take it back to what<br>we know about language that's been<br>studied<br>and the way that the syntax<br>complexity is being used in these k dots<br>is the way that we expect from someone<br>in primary school however the way it was<br>being used in the qdox is the syntactic<br>sophistication found in secondary school<br>and above<br>so while the handwriting looked the same<br>my conclusion that i was able to come to<br>was that there were indicators<br>that<br>the girl had likely been led<br>uh in what to write by someone who had<br>an education of secondary school or a<br>higher so the handwriting was likely<br>hers like i said we don't look at<br>handwriting<br>but the words were very much influenced<br>so if you are interested in these types<br>of topics i can refer you to this<br>chapter that i worked on with natalie<br>schilling<br>in this book which actually goes into<br>quite a number of other examples looking<br>at deception in speaking and writing<br>thank you very much<br>and over to you that was super<br>interesting cheers<br>cool<br>so uh<br>coming from here um it's a very<br>interesting conflict to see um<br>how you actually use the language to<br>figure out if like basically somebody's<br>intentions is that right<br>so um<br>we in uh in this area that um that i'm<br>working in um think about um<br>deception and<br>things that people do in the course of<br>committing a crime but also in the<br>courtroom<br>from an individual perspective again you<br>also talk about the individual but we<br>are talking about like what did they<br>bring with them as a characteristic that<br>they bring with them<br>so uh one of the things that um has been<br>um quite interesting in the past uh or<br>one of the characteristics is a<br>psychopathic personality<br>and uh so i want to start out with also<br>a case example<br>so imagine you're in the courtroom<br>and you're hearing about this case on<br>april 22nd um 2014 susan died from a<br>debilitating and mysterious illness<br>police determined her husband john<br>had been slowly poisoning susan<br>while pretending to care and nurse her<br>back to health while she had a very<br>severe illness<br>two months prior to her death john spoke<br>to his wife about increasing the values<br>of her their life insurance policies he<br>subsequently raised each of their<br>policies to be valued at 250 000 each<br>john accep attempted to collect the<br>money on his policy only days after his<br>wife's burial<br>this was the second marriage of jon<br>he was first married with a wife he was<br>divorced from<br>only after six months when after they<br>got married<br>and in this case that first wife<br>discovered that sean had a sexual<br>relationship with a woman<br>shortly after divorcing with his first<br>wife john met and moved in with susan<br>they married six weeks later and in his<br>free time john reported that he enjoyed<br>going to the casino<br>and one friend stated that he was fun to<br>be around because he's so carefree and<br>spent money like it grown trees<br>prior to his arrest<br>john had been a manager at a local<br>clothing store for approximately one<br>year he had previously worked on another<br>location but had to be transferred due<br>to physical altercations with his boss<br>his boss had<br>re-primed pre-mandated him for<br>consistently um disregarding the<br>company's policy on inappropriate<br>language in the workplace<br>although there was evidence that john<br>provoked the physical fight john claimed<br>self-defense and witnesses were unable<br>to speak on details of the altercation<br>instead of firing john and risking a<br>potential civil lawsuit the company<br>transferred him to another location<br>during the trial so while you're there<br>john ins insisted on talking um<br>on taking the stand to<br>testify in his own defense against the<br>advice of his attorney<br>on the stand john appeared confident<br>self-assured stating that it is<br>ridiculous for a man of his stature to<br>pledge for his life<br>john denied any participation in the<br>crime and instead stated susan was<br>suicidal<br>due to the pain associated with her<br>illness<br>and he also spoke at length about how<br>the events events both<br>his wife's death and the trial had<br>interfered with his life<br>reports from the local jail where he was<br>during before the trial started um<br>suggested jon was well behaved while<br>awaiting trial with the exception of a<br>single brief verbal altercation with a<br>corrections officer and he was described<br>by guards as a rule follower and<br>cooperative inmate<br>so now<br>think a little bit what do you think<br>about this person and how would you<br>perceive such a person in the courtroom<br>well when we<br>give such example<br>descriptions to participants and studies<br>what they most often<br>say is that this person is high on<br>psychopathic personality so what is<br>psychopathy um<br>many people think first about examples<br>in movies and in the literature like<br>honeybell lecture<br>who are highly psychopathic<br>and commit uh<br>serious crimes oftentimes also very<br>sadistic crimes<br>um however that's not necessarily a<br>characteristic of it but um what people<br>high on psychopathy are characterized by<br>is<br>impulsive<br>anti-sociality<br>and an unemotional dominant style<br>what do these things mean so this<br>impulsive anti-sociality is defined by<br>risk-taking<br>being irresponsible<br>ignoring rules<br>rules of the society and other rules and<br>harming others<br>and the other component of psychopathy<br>is basically this unemotionality and<br>being very dominant and this is<br>described at what people often<br>say this is really the core of a<br>psychopathic personality this low<br>empathy it was low ability to feel with<br>other people<br>very savvy<br>on the social side being able to<br>manipulate others and basically getting<br>off what they want from others very<br>easily<br>and also pathological lying there we go<br>deception alarm<br>so this is what people think that people<br>high in psychopathy are probably very<br>so<br>there are a couple of studies out there<br>that actually looked into that if people<br>high on psychopathy lie more<br>and what is important to consider when<br>we talk about this is that we don't see<br>psychopathy as a<br>um a kind of like disease type of<br>characteristic which you either have or<br>you have not it's not you are<br>psychopathically not but psychopathic<br>personality traits are dimensional and<br>so people vary on that dimension and<br>have more or less of those traits so any<br>of those results that i'm going to talk<br>about um are related to a this idea that<br>you can have a relationship between the<br>higher somebody is uh or scores on those<br>psychopathic traits<br>for example for this variable x the<br>higher they are on this other variable x<br>so it's important to keep in mind that<br>it's not about people<br>that we compare people who are<br>psychopaths and with non-psychopaths but<br>we think about it<br>do higher levels of this trait relate to<br>something<br>so in terms of lying<br>what actually has been found is that um<br>people who are high on psychopathy<br>tend to exaggerate the reactivity of<br>their homicides and<br>being like more a reactive um<br>behavior rather than a proactive<br>behavior and they also tend to omit<br>major details of their offenses so<br>that's something that goes along with<br>these traits as in trying to downplay<br>certain aspects but also being very<br>savvy about that<br>in<br>which which parts of them<br>um<br>another thing that has been found is<br>actually that people high in psychopathy<br>tend to speak faster<br>and do more blinking and more head<br>movements while they're lying<br>in comparison to other people who are<br>lying so uh again important to look at<br>what the comparison is so they seem to<br>show that also in their uh the the way<br>that they um talk um to show some<br>certain characteristics that<br>are seem to be related to the to this uh<br>psychopathic to the psychopathic traits<br>does not necessarily yet uh tell us more<br>about the success of the lion<br>and um they also uh have been found to<br>um<br>when they can choose to lie to<br>really more often choose to lie so if<br>it's like open to them um they would<br>rather go for lying than telling the<br>truth and it's actually also quite<br>interesting this pathological lying<br>criterion of psychopathy is not<br>necessarily just like<br>lying for the purpose of getting<br>something which would make a lot of<br>sense for some people<br>but also lying just for the purpose of<br>lying so just seeing can i convince<br>somebody of something that has not<br>happened<br>and how good am i in doing so so this is<br>quite interesting that's also this kind<br>of playing with the other person in the<br>social context<br>and you can imagine how that can also<br>play a role in the courtroom<br>and what is also quite interesting um<br>so how do they potentially do that um<br>what has been found is that<br>if um<br>the participants are asked to show a<br>deceptive facial expression so to show a<br>facial expression that they're actually<br>not it's not related to how they<br>currently feel<br>um the leakage of their true emotion the<br>state how long that leaks through is<br>shorter for them so they they actually<br>don't show that much of much of a<br>leakage so they are very good in<br>actually pretending a facial expression<br>in comparison to those lower on<br>psychopathy<br>so yes they t<br>seem to do that more often not only in<br>this<br>description or as kind of a symptom of<br>psychopathy<br>but now of course the big question is<br>are they actually better in doing<br>that well<br>there are mixed findings so that's<br>definitely not a clear picture there are<br>some findings that show that<br>these psychopathic traits contribute to<br>be a good liar to be convincing<br>to convince people of things that have<br>not happened um but there are also other<br>findings that did not replicate that so<br>it's really<br>not a clear picture if they're really<br>better at it even if they try to to use<br>that<br>um<br>uh also what we um can do to actually<br>try to understand better um<br>what is happening while somebody is<br>lying and if that is related to certain<br>personality traits but also to the way<br>that they deal with the current<br>situation<br>um<br>some studies have looked and it's very<br>few studies only unfortunately so far um<br>what is going on in the brain while<br>people are lying so um<br>and<br>the unfortunate thing is so far the<br>picture is really diverse so some<br>studies found higher brain activities in<br>a brain activity in areas that are<br>linked to emotional processing so<br>something that goes on when when you<br>actually probably feel bad about telling<br>a lie not to being truthful<br>and other studies found<br>higher activities a higher and lower<br>activity is not uh it's not consistent<br>between the studies and so i think that<br>probably needs just more work in this<br>area very small sample sizes but this<br>could be an avenue in the future to<br>figure out why what is that that's going<br>on that makes it<br>probably um<br>easier for them to do it and what does<br>it um how does it then relate to the<br>behavior<br>and uh as an another addition although<br>psychopathy is related to malingering<br>for example as well so there is a<br>correlation<br>it is not a good predictor so coming<br>back to this idea about sometimes two<br>variables can be correlated so they<br>co-occur co-occur<br>that does not necessarily necessarily<br>mean that from knowing one<br>tells you something about the other one<br>so for example knowing that somebody's<br>high in psychopathy does not give you a<br>guarantee that this person is going to<br>be malingering or lying consistently so<br>that's important to keep in mind<br>correlations are not<br>not always good predictors<br>so um<br>now that we know um people high in<br>psychopathy<br>do lie more<br>but they are not necessarily better with<br>it the question is how do they present<br>themselves in the courtroom and coming<br>back to that example<br>i mentioned at the beginning so how do<br>you see john when he's there on trial<br>and and defending himself himself so<br>this is a very interesting area of<br>research<br>that ties into this um<br>uh<br>question of how make people make<br>decisions so especially juries make<br>decisions<br>um<br>and<br>what we do in this context we give these<br>kind of um scenarios that one that i<br>just read out to you to people and we<br>tell them imagine you are in the jury<br>imagine you're at the courtroom and uh<br>that you have to make um a decision and<br>we give them these um scripts um short<br>descriptions of a of a case and then we<br>ask them and that's a main research in<br>this field is predominantly uh done in<br>the us where um<br>the question is then oftentimes um do<br>you consider death sentence or a prison<br>sentence for this um person<br>and then we can ask we can evaluate on<br>basing these descriptions that have been<br>given um what is what this response and<br>we can also ask how certain are you and<br>how responsible do you think this person<br>is and how treatable do you think this<br>person is<br>and as you can imagine we can then vary<br>this description so the one that i just<br>read out to you was one that actually<br>had cues in it for<br>somebody being high on psychopathy you<br>can vary the description keep all the<br>text the same all the words the same<br>almost and just very tiny bits and<br>pieces where it's about<br>characteristics that refer to<br>psychopathic personality and then see<br>how this variation in these scripts um<br>have an impact or<br>vary the the way that people evaluate it<br>and come to a conclusion about it<br>so what do we find when we investigate<br>how do<br>these descriptions vary on psychopathic<br>traits in the defendant<br>influence the<br>decisions<br>first of all as you know public<br>perception is of psychopaths is to be<br>intelligent cunning dangerous and<br>interest intrinsically evil<br>so basically that applies to the jury<br>members as well<br>and so what we find is that<br>there's a higher support for death<br>penalty and less positive<br>evaluation of potential positive<br>treatment effects for people that are<br>described as highly psychopathic<br>and interestingly this is not not even<br>mentioning the word psychopathy at all<br>so this is all also holds if this is<br>just a description as one that i just<br>the interesting other question then was<br>in a recent study that we're just um<br>writing up at the moment uh does gender<br>matter because gender tends to matter in<br>the courtroom in terms of how people<br>perceive a defendant and how they they<br>think about this defendant to be<br>treatable as well and so we wanted to<br>see in in a variation of this varying<br>the gender of the defendant<br>by simply uh swapping the name<br>um and also varying the characteristic<br>the psycho psychopathic characteristics<br>from uh being more this violent male<br>type of um uh stereotyped male<br>psychopathic characteristic description<br>to a more female one where it's more<br>like malingering and more<br>indirect violent or indirect and<br>anti-social behavior<br>very stereotyped<br>interestingly<br>neither of the two things mattered so<br>here we not not the defendant gender did<br>not matter and not the characteristics<br>of those psychopathic traits no matter<br>what those who were described as more<br>psychopathic in this type of description<br>were<br>referred to as should that they should<br>have a receive death penalty more often<br>and would be less able to or we would be<br>less<br>so um now the big question is of course<br>what are the mechanisms how and why does<br>why does that um what is uh what is the<br>relationship between psychopathy and<br>malingering and lying and being<br>deceptive<br>and uh especially in the courtroom where<br>it's like a highly stressful environment<br>so<br>one can think of<br>the stress resistance that's part of the<br>characteristics could be one of them<br>which is actually linked to another<br>characteristic of psychopathy so people<br>high on psychopathy are low on fear they<br>just don't<br>feel the same stage fright and they<br>don't feel the same type of<br>fear of punishment also very relevant to<br>the courtroom so that might be some sort<br>of mechanism that is underlying this and<br>here's more research to be done<br>definitely<br>so what can we conclude<br>psychopathy is related to more lying but<br>not too better lying so far<br>psycho psychopathic defendants are seen<br>as more punishable and<br>less treatable<br>the only question or many questions are<br>still open but one question would be<br>should we actually assess psychopathic<br>traits for the courtroom should we let<br>people know that this defendant is high<br>in psychopathy or should we rather not<br>and this is something food for thought<br>for yourself<br>and i mean thank you and um i think<br>we're going to move into the thai<br>section questions um and really<br>okay<br>so i think we're gonna wait until some<br>questions come in and<br>until it starts maybe you can i can i<br>would be interested to hear how do you<br>actually ever think about<br>characteristics of the individuals like<br>other characteristics why are you doing<br>this no i don't i actually um<br>specifically asked to not be told<br>anything about them because it's very<br>important that i separate the linguistic<br>analysis from a psychological analysis<br>because i'm not a<br>psychologist so i can't look at those<br>aspects and i have been asked by um<br>attorneys in the courtroom to comment on<br>that but no i cannot because that's not<br>my area of specialty so sometimes people<br>offer to tell me<br>things about the suspects and i ask not<br>to be told<br>so how much do you actually then know<br>from about the case in general um i know<br>what<br>the proceedings have been so far up till<br>that point<br>i also ask to be given<br>any evidence that has anything to do<br>with language that's under consideration<br>and that's considered relevant at the<br>time<br>and i ask for<br>whoever i'm working with to<br>whichever agency or whichever attorney<br>to give me very specific questions of<br>what they want to know and then i'll ask<br>them do you actually mean this or you<br>know is it is it this you're looking at<br>until we get to the language related<br>issues and then that's where i can give<br>an assessment on the language so it's<br>always a piece of the puzzle<br>but it can never be the full answer to<br>the puzzle<br>it's also interesting because you try to<br>not being influenced by all sorts of<br>characteristics exactly<br>yeah exactly and i mean there is a<br>motive language that comes out you know<br>of course but that's that's tied into<br>the language so that can be<br>analyzed from a linguistic perspective<br>but yeah no anything about the past<br>history of the person or any of that i<br>don't want to know that<br>because that would influence<br>so how much do you look at language<br>um good question yeah actually um<br>in that in this type of research it's<br>it's present in all of these pieces of<br>in of research it's present because we<br>use language but not in that way<br>so it's quite interesting so uh going<br>back to court testimony more from the<br>psychology type of um view we do take<br>into account questions that the language<br>yeah how people<br>use the language so but more like in<br>this indirect way so it's much more<br>about it's not not so concrete and not<br>so detailed as you would do in a<br>discourse analysis but we would um um<br>for example the way that somebody<br>interacts with us or with me as a<br>examiner or so the language that they<br>use if they try in an interview for<br>example and do a assessment interview<br>the way they talk with us so that that's<br>definitely something um to consider and<br>if there's<br>people high on psychopathy tend to have<br>a certain way of interacting and also<br>using language and so that definitely<br>comes<br>yeah<br>definitely i can see that<br>okay<br>so one question what happens in the<br>courtroom if the defendant refuses to<br>take the stand and therefore there are<br>so um<br>i suppose i when i analyze things uh<br>it's usually from a linguistic forensic<br>linguistic perspective it's what happens<br>before<br>the courtroom so it's<br>an analysis<br>that takes place as part<br>of the investigation<br>sometimes i am called in by<br>um if if there was a case and something<br>was questionable that happened in the<br>courtroom and now it's being appealed<br>sometimes i'll be called in at that<br>point<br>and<br>i will be asked to<br>review<br>uh some aspect of the testimony but that<br>can be from anyone so it's whatever was<br>at issue so it's not necessarily if the<br>defendant what the defendant said it can<br>be<br>what any of the witnesses said it can be<br>uh what the plaintiff has said it can be<br>what the attorney said and how they<br>went about what they did<br>um so<br>it's<br>it's usually done well it's always done<br>after the fact so i don't do it live<br>because i need that time to<br>sit with the data and do the full<br>analysis and go into depth<br>so whether it's after the fact of the<br>crime's been committed and now the<br>investigation is ongoing or if it's<br>after the trial and now there's an<br>appeal process<br>yeah so you basically work off the<br>transcript yeah after transcript or<br>recording<br>so sometimes i'm given a recording and i<br>then transcribe it and i have the<br>recording and the transcript both to<br>work with because linguistic transcript<br>is also quite different from courtroom<br>transcript it's much more detailed oh<br>what percentage of serious crime is<br>perpetrated by persons high in<br>psychopathic traits in general as<br>opposed to low<br>scoring and psychopathic traits that's a<br>very good question um<br>there is not it's they're not really<br>good numbers on that but what people and<br>it's quite interesting because they're<br>this<br>in the literature<br>there is this number that people come up<br>with um that is not um<br>not really easy to trace down um but<br>because we don't have a full examination<br>of psychopathic traits of people who<br>have committed crime so that would need<br>basically to be able to answer that<br>question right but what is uh actually<br>definitely true is that the percentage<br>of crime that is committed by people<br>higher in psychopathy is is higher than<br>you would expect so it's kind of it's<br>also there's there's not only the<br>serious crime but it's also more<br>iterative um<br>so people who are high in psychopathy um<br>commit crimes more often so they also<br>come back um<br>more often and for that reason there is<br>actually the bulk of the<br>crimes are actually committed more by<br>people higher on psychopathy while<br>they're lower in psychology<br>and here's another question for you<br>do you retrospectively analyze whether<br>someone is demonstrating some<br>psychopathic traits or does it take<br>place during a proceeding and what other<br>factors do you look at if any<br>um well um retrospective analysis so we<br>don't think that psychopathic traits<br>change that quickly so we would always<br>think that they somebody if i assess<br>them today they will have similar traits<br>tomorrow in the week time they change<br>over the life course but um they can be<br>done retrospectively if you want to say<br>so however um uh depends on where you<br>are and how that assessment is um asked<br>for<br>so sometimes it's during a trial that<br>they come out and say like we want this<br>assessment and then you would do this<br>assessment but not in the courtroom so<br>you would need for an assessment of for<br>psychopathic traits you need file<br>records um you need to go and talk<br>ideally you talk with the person and<br>have a couple of sessions with them and<br>then you do an expert based rating that<br>you need to be trained for and you can<br>do that at any time and um<br>yeah if this<br>those if you<br>if you have like a such an assessment<br>you probably don't need to do another<br>one a year later because they're kind of<br>stable yeah that makes sense<br>can i uh ask you that question that's<br>posted um speaking in the third person<br>or in language that doesn't um<br>apportion blame in the active voice is<br>the writing style that lawyers adopt and<br>are taught<br>is that something that you take into<br>consideration<br>yeah that's a great question so um yes<br>that's why<br>there are a lot of these features that<br>individually can be assigned to<br>different groups or different genres<br>different writing or speaking styles<br>that's why we take the whole bank of<br>these things together to analyze and see<br>if there's<br>a patterning happening across a larger<br>group of features if it was<br>you know genre-specific such as that and<br>we're not finding the other deceptive<br>markers well that actually can tell us<br>that might be someone who<br>had some sort of training either<br>self-training or formal training<br>um in legalese as well so it's still a<br>clue a language clue um but when it<br>comes to deception yeah we would take<br>the whole bank of possible features to<br>see how many are being ticked off by<br>that<br>related to that i wondered when you<br>showed that plot with um how much the so<br>what the these features were of the<br>writing style um from the pieces of that<br>of that girl and then in comparison to<br>that<br>documenting question and you were<br>referring to that the the features that<br>um in the the other pieces of writing<br>were more similar to like a school level<br>yeah yeah how do you know that is that<br>are there some sort of norms out there<br>so there are heaps of studies that have<br>already happened looking at um you know<br>in language learning and education and<br>looking at development of language so<br>we know things about the the syntactic<br>complexity the type of complex<br>vocabulary that people can use that they<br>tend to use so there's a common<br>patterning<br>in the way that people<br>at different ages and at different<br>educational levels assuming that they've<br>continued in their education you know<br>otherwise it's just at that educational<br>level whatever their age might be<br>but um it patterns in a certain way and<br>yes there's give and take but not so<br>drastically that you would get<br>someone suddenly jumping<br>one day they're writing all like a<br>primary school student and always<br>writing that way and then you know the<br>next week they're writing like a<br>secondary school that doesn't happen<br>unless they're led or you know<br>encouraged to include certain words and<br>phrases and it has to do with also the<br>um the complexity of the sentences<br>themselves how many embedded phrases you<br>have within the sentence<br>so the younger people are the<br>younger their educational level is they<br>tend to use more direct less embedded<br>parts in their sentences the more<br>educated someone is<br>their<br>sentence structure gets much more<br>complex and they have many more embedded<br>pieces<br>and also something related to that can<br>you could you tell from the writing<br>style and again are there norms or<br>something that you can compare it to<br>from like from which area from a country<br>or from which part of the world<br>somebody's coming from or<br>you mentioned the level of education<br>what type exactly of education so for<br>example what type of schooling that<br>would have been or<br>stuff yeah possible well that's one that<br>is one of the things i ask if um the<br>people approaching me for an analysis if<br>they can tell me if this person<br>the language they're operating in is<br>that their first language is it an<br>additional language<br>what's the<br>you know what's the region is that the<br>region they're from or have they moved<br>that sort of information is highly<br>relevant<br>because then that tells me if i need to<br>take into consideration these types of<br>structures and word choices<br>from people who may have grown up in one<br>place<br>in one language one language variety and<br>moved somewhere else and then it gets a<br>lot more complex but that is something<br>else i do is i do look at people who are<br>operating in an additional language that<br>they learned later<br>and look at also what would the norms be<br>in<br>their first language<br>and<br>look at kind of what might be going on<br>there if there's some sort of<br>overlap of features or if something else<br>is going on so it gets very<br>multi-leveled in the analysis yeah i can<br>imagine but it's interesting also that<br>you actually use it as an information i<br>guess a source to base your uh analysis<br>yeah yeah because it's important we<br>never you know we never drop any<br>features of<br>we might think we do but we don't<br>any of the<br>um<br>the subconscious features of the way we<br>speak and of the other languages we've<br>learned and of the additional ones we<br>pick up and places we've lived that all<br>becomes part of our linguistic<br>repertoire<br>so it's all pieces of the puzzle<br>what was your most interesting<br>the most interesting piece or like as in<br>format of type of writing or language<br>not only writing but language that you<br>actually<br>ever analyzed um<br>that's tricky<br>right there are so many interesting ones<br>i mean one of my favorite things to look<br>at has even more of a crossover with<br>psychology which is looking at the<br>reliability of<br>uh<br>testimony your witness testimony when<br>someone says you know<br>i heard this person say this they<br>sounded like this they did this i can<br>identify them because they sound like<br>this<br>i didn't see their face but they sound<br>like<br>you know and then looking at<br>looking at that and seeing how reliable<br>that is or what sort of other real world<br>things they're drawing upon<br>that area of inquiry fascinates me and<br>i've done quite a bit of research in<br>that area as well and um<br>worked a number of cases in that but<br>that's interesting too because then you<br>know you get the transcripts but you<br>also get the interviews with people<br>you know and it's really interesting<br>there are markers in discourse as well<br>that we can look at when people are<br>trying to reconstruct mentally what<br>happened<br>and so<br>chasing those markers and seeing what<br>they correspond with to see at what<br>times they're trying to piece back<br>together things that happened and those<br>are also times when their memories most<br>likely not as accurate<br>and how do you see that then<br>what are these markers um<br>good questions<br>so some of the markers have to do with<br>restarts in the language the amount of<br>times you restart and stop and hesitate<br>and then start again those are things we<br>do naturally when we're talking people<br>do it different ways some people do it<br>by um uh yeah some people do it just by<br>restarting the word or sentence again<br>some people do it by cutting themselves<br>off and stopping with silence and then<br>continuing on but all of these are<br>hesitancies that show their thinking<br>they're trying to piece through those<br>bits together<br>so if if somebody has read all your<br>papers and all these books<br>would they then be able to<br>get away with uh conception no<br>that is one thing i worry about that is<br>yeah so i i am very careful about how<br>much detail i<br>share specifically because um no i i<br>always do consider that having done my<br>training in washington dc<br>you know i do<br>have that always i'm concerned with that<br>so um but<br>no unfortunately they might have an idea<br>of how to do a very rudimentary analysis<br>but they're not going to be able to<br>cover themselves up because there are<br>also things so under the radar that<br>people there's no way<br>you can't no matter how much you<br>practice you just can't yeah you know<br>yeah<br>so yeah that's so funny because it's uh<br>in the in the faking um<br>area of um well psychology or also<br>psychopathy that's uh it's also a<br>question and it's kind of interesting<br>people try to fake to be high or low on<br>psychopathy it's just overshoot so yeah<br>if you ask people to do that they just<br>overshoot completely yeah it's just so<br>out of question that it's not exactly<br>an area of concern yeah yeah and i<br>totally understand that and that's why<br>you know we compare<br>across<br>a set of documents or recordings or<br>whatever because you can see a person's<br>natural variation and then you can also<br>see when suddenly something's way off<br>the scale because something else is<br>going on like they're trying to<br>trying to make you think they're doing<br>or thinking something else<br>yeah<br>it's almost interesting how we<br>uh we think it's so easy to fake<br>something but it's actually not yeah<br>there are some great classic examples of<br>that too<br>where um<br>people have for example william lebov a<br>very well well-known<br>sociolinguistic variationist in<br>pennsylvania<br>he<br>works worked on some cases in the past<br>for the us government and one of them<br>was a kidnapping case<br>where the ransom letter<br>spelled<br>all these very simple words wrong<br>but then spelled extremely complicated<br>words correctly<br>and it turned out you know it<br>the person they found him and he was a<br>doctor<br>and he was trying to downplay his<br>intelligence level but again there are<br>things that<br>you're so used to in your everyday you<br>don't even think that they can then give<br>away who you are yeah you know<br>you know what i what just occurred to me<br>what would be such a cool collaboration<br>so when<br>as i said earlier so people hide in<br>psychology they sometimes they they lie<br>for the sake of lying they don't need to<br>get something so one of the interesting<br>things that i came across is that people<br>who have committed crimes and if you<br>interview them<br>um<br>and who are high on psychopathy they<br>there are some cases where they actually<br>they tell you about crimes they have<br>never committed that's fascinating i<br>think so too why would you do that yeah<br>but it's in the in the in the context of<br>research where it's like and there's<br>like no there's no yeah percussion so<br>uh but it's it's more about this making<br>somebody believe something and seeing my<br>reaction yeah is the assessor so how<br>does this person react if i tell them<br>about that it would be so interesting to<br>see if you from if you look at these<br>these statements if there would be<br>anything that you can take out if that<br>would be really interesting because that<br>is where the<br>the some of the research has come in<br>saying<br>you know people either give way too many<br>details<br>or men way too few yeah and that would<br>be one of the starting places and<br>actually i say there's no trap up so one<br>of the things i would say if people are<br>keen<br>on checking out how they themselves lie<br>i always have my students write two<br>pieces<br>of text<br>right one where you tell a short story<br>of a paragraph for so long of something<br>that recently happened to you and it's<br>true<br>and one where you make something up<br>and put them aside and bring them back<br>out a week later and then analyze and<br>see do you give more detail do you give<br>less detail how did your language change<br>and that will give you an indication of<br>that's amazing<br>that's a really cool exercise so thank<br>you to everyone i guess we'll wrap up<br>here<br>thank you as well<br>and well yeah if you have any questions<br>you can contact us<br>indeed<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
