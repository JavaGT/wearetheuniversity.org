in the college of education<br>auditorium welcome and to those online<br>welcome my name is richard blakey i'm<br>deputy vice chancellor for research and<br>enterprise here at the university of<br>otago and i'm just going to um be very<br>very brief in welcoming um dr asher<br>verrill<br>onto campus and welcome her back to a<br>place that she knows very well<br>and also thank her for all of her<br>efforts<br>before entering parliament with us at<br>otago in helping to contribute to the<br>efforts we've got to keep ourselves and<br>our communities safe from covert 19<br>and uh really just it's been our great<br>pleasure to to have you uh back here and<br>uh to reconnect you with some of your<br>old<br>haunts but to show you some of the other<br>things that we've got here um we're very<br>very pleased that you<br>expressed a desire to give a public<br>lecture while you're here and i think<br>there's<br>people both in this audience and many<br>people online who are really interested<br>to hear what you say want to say<br>so i will get out of the way and i will<br>hand over to professor bob hancock from<br>the department of preventive and social<br>medicine to give a little bit more<br>detail by way of introduction to<br>minister but can you please join me in<br>welcoming minister to the campus<br>i'm bob hancox i'm the head of the<br>department of preventive and social<br>medicine and i'm honored to introduce<br>the honourable doctor aisha verrell for<br>this lecture<br>so each year our department hosts uh<br>invites a distinguished guest to provide<br>an open lecture on the state of public<br>health<br>and it was sort of ironic in the biggest<br>health crisis of our time that last year<br>we had to cancel the lecture<br>and we were we were far from confident<br>that we were going to be able to hold a<br>lecture this year so we are uh delighted<br>that the stars have aligned and uh we're<br>able to host dr ish veril for this<br>lecture to do uh this year<br>so dr verrell is very well known to many<br>people in the university and in our<br>department in particular<br>she studied medicine at the university<br>of otago and while here as an<br>undergraduate student made a huge impact<br>particularly the otago university<br>student association serving as<br>the representatives for the health<br>sciences division the women's rights<br>officer and eventually the president<br>of the the student association<br>she also had an instrumental role in<br>finding the the new zealand medical<br>student journal<br>after graduating as a doctor she<br>undertook uh training as a specialist in<br>infectious diseases mainly based in<br>wellington and overseas um<br>and i practiced in wellington as a<br>specialist public health a specialist<br>infectious disease physician<br>but returned to otago to undertake a phd<br>through our department<br>uh the phd will study in uh<br>tuberculosis in indonesia<br>and it's important to notice<br>that even though she was studying a<br>devastating disease in a disadvantaged<br>population<br>she was really interested in what<br>protected people from getting infected<br>in other words she was taking a<br>strength-based approach to a<br>after completing a phd<br>dr vero continued to work as an<br>infectious disease specialist and a<br>senior lecturer at the university of<br>otago wellington<br>and then entered parliament at the last<br>election before becoming a minister<br>dr verrell holds a number of ministerial<br>portfolios including minister for food<br>safety minister for seniors associate<br>minister for research<br>science and innovation<br>but what is closest to our hearts at<br>least in our department is the fact that<br>she's associate minister for health<br>she's played a very leading role in the<br>response to covert<br>but she's also been in many involved in<br>many other public health initiatives<br>including water fluoridation<br>trying to prevent rheumatic heart<br>disease and proposals for a smoke-free<br>free aotearoa<br>these have the potential to transform<br>the health of new zealanders in<br>particular they promise to<br>improve the health of some of the most<br>disadvantaged people in our society<br>dr verrell aisha we are delighted to<br>welcome you back and we're very much<br>inamana<br>tena koto katoa<br>kahuriki<br>it's a real pleasure to be back at the<br>university today and thank you richard<br>and bob for that<br>very warm welcome and thank you richard<br>for hosting me today<br>i really value the chance to meet new<br>and established researchers and as we'll<br>discuss science-based policy is really<br>important to me so chance to meet with<br>your researchers has been very valuable<br>it's nice to see so many old friends in<br>the audience too<br>i'd like to begin by acknowledging the<br>many researchers asked and staff of the<br>university of otago who have contributed<br>to the covert 19 response<br>um recently<br>and i know there are many of you but<br>some of the contributions<br>that i'm aware of include<br>we've recently had epidemio<br>epidemiologist professor trish priest<br>seconded to the ministry of health to<br>assist us with covert 19 modeling we've<br>been<br>benefited from the collaboration um betw<br>between uh jimmy gergen and um esr on<br>whole genome sequencing of covert 19.<br>and alongside that<br>professor<br>murdoch incoming vice chancellor and<br>james ushers and others have served on<br>several technical advisory<br>groups i'm sure there are many others of<br>you who have who have helped i'm very<br>grateful for that<br>it's also a pleasure to be back on<br>campus because for me like so many new<br>zealanders<br>this university played a role in helping<br>me become who i am<br>you may or may not want to take the<br>credit for that and while i'm sometimes<br>still surprised to find myself in in the<br>role i'm currently in i if i think of<br>myself as a former medical student and i<br>usa student president then perhaps i<br>should acknowledge there were clues that<br>i might have ended up in the job in<br>health politics that i'm currently in<br>and crucial to my readiness to enter<br>parliament and cabinet during a pandemic<br>was the rigorous training in medicine<br>and epidemiology that i enjoyed here<br>during my undergraduate and doctoral<br>studies so i'm immensely grateful for<br>the teaching of epidemiologists like<br>professors skeg dixon paul and hill from<br>whom i developed a structured approach<br>to disease prevention<br>so today i want to outline some of the<br>initiatives that i've been involved with<br>in the field of public health<br>and then i want to discuss the covert 19<br>response and the transition in that<br>response that we're currently going<br>through<br>i'm most interested to reflect on what i<br>think the lessons we should take from<br>the public health response to covet are<br>and finally i want to discuss how we can<br>embed these lessons in our reformed<br>so earlier this month i was extremely<br>proud to be part of the government<br>passing the health fluoridation of<br>drinking water amendment bill<br>i know<br>otago as a leading<br>a centre of dental education excellence<br>has played an important role in<br>advocating for fluoridation<br>as many of you will know evidence has<br>shown that since since the 1950s<br>that fluoride prevents dental caries and<br>our country's oral health is poor<br>in 2019 six uh 6<br>270 children under the age of 14 were<br>admitted to for operations for dental<br>admitted to hospital for operations for<br>dental caries<br>i'm aware otago<br>has done excellent work and laying the<br>evidence base for this<br>the bill entered parliament in 2016 and<br>as originally drafted sought to pass<br>decision-making from local authorities<br>to district health boards<br>one of my first decisions as minister<br>was to take the opportunity to amend the<br>bill by supplementary order paper to<br>instead have the director-general of<br>health as the decision maker rather than<br>dhbs as proposed<br>this is a long-standing labor policy and<br>it is in my view a vast improvement<br>community water fluoridation should not<br>be a political decision<br>and we are only able to achieve<br>equitable health equitable health<br>outcomes if evidence-based public<br>decision public health decisions are not<br>re-litigated by a dr raft of different<br>local authorities<br>now the director-general of health will<br>make decisions about fluoridation of<br>community drinking water supplies<br>potentially extending coverage from<br>about 50<br>of community water supplies<br>to more than 80<br>and improving the oral health of tens of<br>thousands of new zealanders<br>from december the ministry of health<br>will be writing to water suppliers to<br>gauge among other things<br>uh their readiness to commence<br>fluoridation and the director general<br>will be able to make decisions or<br>directions to fluoridate from mid-2022<br>as i've mentioned previously we have<br>some funds to assist local authorities<br>with this transition<br>and i hope that local authorities in the<br>southern region will take the<br>opportunity to act quickly<br>another area of progress has been the<br>mandating of folate fortification of<br>non-organic bread flour bread making<br>wheat flour<br>we know this vitamin is crucial to the<br>healthy development of babies in early<br>pregnancy<br>and often at a stage when even before<br>the woman knows she's pregnant<br>also about half of pregnancies in new<br>zealand are unplanned so it's not<br>possible for all women to take folic<br>acid supplementation one month before<br>they conceive to reduce their risk<br>individually of their baby developing a<br>neural tube defect such as spina bifida<br>this is another public health measure<br>for which the science was unequivocal<br>yet new zealand had opted out of a joint<br>australian new zealand food standard to<br>mandate for<br>fold late fortification in 2009<br>this followed a scare campaign led by<br>the food and grocery council which<br>forced then minister kate wilkinson to<br>abandon the proposal<br>both folate and fluoridation are<br>reminders that misinformation have been<br>potent weapons against public health<br>action in the past<br>that's why i approach my work on these<br>issues very carefully<br>our progress this term has been enabled<br>by high quality reports published by the<br>prime minister's chief science advisors<br>on these topics and also some good<br>journalism<br>but also by the government's<br>prioritization of child well-being<br>science is essential information to how<br>we solve some of our most pressing<br>problems<br>but how you act on that information is<br>ultimately a matter of values in<br>politics<br>earlier this year i announced a major<br>upgrade of the breast cancer screening<br>system and a new primary cervical<br>screening test to help reduce the number<br>of women dying from these diseases<br>breast cancer touches the lives of many<br>families in new zealand and i'm<br>committed to ensuring new zealand women<br>can access the health care they need<br>the upgrade to the breast cancer<br>screening register will ensure women<br>aren't falling through the cracks by<br>reaching out to the 271 000 women who<br>are eligible to access breast cancer<br>screening but are not currently screened<br>directly inviting them to get screened<br>and running targeted targeted campaigns<br>in other words by moving from an opt-in<br>to an opt-out register we can improve<br>the reach of breast cancer screening<br>particularly into maori and pacific<br>communities<br>and while our cervical screening program<br>has been a very effective tool for<br>reducing cancer cervical cancer<br>only about 65 percent of eligible wahine<br>maori access it because of the excess<br>acceptability of the current smear test<br>fakama associated with the procedure is<br>also another barrier as is time and cost<br>i've been working on a budget bid for<br>this issue for months when my<br>friend and colleague and the beehive<br>minister kitty allen told me that she<br>was unwell<br>sadly it's these same barriers that led<br>her to developing a stage 3 cervical<br>cancer<br>it was with mixed feelings that i got<br>the 100 million dollar investment in<br>these two programs across the line in<br>the last budget<br>but now i'm proud to say we're funding<br>an effective simple and quick swab women<br>can choose to do themselves reducing<br>barriers and making screening services<br>more accessible<br>particularly for maori and pacific women<br>again information technology upgrades<br>are an important enabler of this change<br>a new system will track women a woman<br>through the appropriate clinical pathway<br>and generate an alert when a swab or an<br>appointment is missed<br>and i'm pleased to say my friend kitty<br>is back at work in the beehive in the<br>office next to me recovered working hard<br>and always there to discuss a difficult<br>problem or share a life late into the<br>night<br>but throughout my first year in<br>parliament the most acute public health<br>issues have been those relating to<br>covert 19.<br>let's and i want to reflect together on<br>our experience to date<br>after the virus first appeared in china<br>in late 2019 and began to spread rapidly<br>around the world it became clear that<br>new zealand's standard pandemic<br>preparedness plan based on influenza<br>would result in a nurse missing an<br>opportunity to control the disease<br>for me<br>this realisation followed the release of<br>the world health organisation special<br>mission report into the wuhan outbreak<br>on february 28 2020<br>the report mentioned important<br>differences between sars kovi and<br>influenza including a lower rate of<br>asymptomatic disease and a longer<br>incubation period both important fact<br>factors for the success of contact<br>racing<br>in late march following the detection of<br>cases in the community in new zealand<br>the government introduced a new<br>four-level alert system<br>to clearly indicate the current public<br>health risk and the necessary measures<br>required to protect new zealanders and<br>eliminate the virus from our shores<br>this approach evolved into new zealand's<br>elimination strategy a sustained<br>approach to keep it out find it and<br>stamp it out<br>our elimination strategy protected the<br>majority of communities from the virus<br>for more than 18 months something that's<br>evident in the relatively few<br>hospitalizations and deaths here<br>compared to overseas<br>from the start of the pandemic until the<br>auckland delta outbreak this year there<br>were only 26 deaths in new zealand out<br>of<br>2571 cases<br>new zealanders enjoyed relative freedoms<br>in the face of covert 19 something that<br>was rare globally and as other<br>jurisdictions faced lengthy lockdowns<br>and high death rates with significant<br>strain on the health system<br>i want to think about some of the<br>reasons for that success because their<br>lessons are useful the lessons are<br>useful as we transition our covert 19<br>response and as we restructure the<br>health system<br>the first is about the role of science<br>the centrality of science to our covert<br>19 response is undoubtedly a reason for<br>the good<br>outcomes that new zealand has enjoyed<br>but what makes for successful<br>incorporation of science into policy<br>during a pandemic<br>clearly having a critical mass of<br>technical expertise within our<br>institutions including the ministry of<br>health<br>is important and the director general<br>has built that um that critical mass up<br>over the course of the pandemic<br>and we have processes to capture<br>insights from domestic experts<br>international posts the science<br>lecturers literature and modeling i've<br>sought to strengthen these linkages<br>through the announcement of a strategic<br>scientific investment fund focused on<br>infectious diseases<br>i've also worked with minister hipkins<br>to commission advice from the strategic<br>public health advisory committee chaired<br>by professor sir professor david skegg<br>and on which professor murdoch also also<br>serves<br>one of the challenges we face is being<br>able to plan ahead in a dynamic<br>environment<br>you will recall that this group's august<br>advice was about safely reconnecting new<br>zealand<br>that began a work program that included<br>developing methods to evaluate and<br>manage risks posed by returning<br>travellers<br>developing vaccine passports and<br>altering the duration and<br>and setting for quarantine<br>a key<br>a key feature of the advice would that<br>be would be was that there would be<br>three categories of return traveler<br>those from high medium and low risk<br>countries<br>it is that work that has enabled the<br>phased reopening<br>that minister hitkins announced on<br>wednesday however it is fair to say that<br>every single aspect of our work on that<br>on this program has changed most notably<br>the emergence of delta around the world<br>meant that we the number of low-risk<br>countries has become very small indeed<br>another vital lesson from the pandemic<br>is the need to build strong public<br>health systems<br>in fact we need to build strong public<br>health systems as if our lives depended<br>on them because they do<br>that is what we have done with our<br>contact racing system<br>we have turned around<br>decades of under investment in health<br>public health units and invested in the<br>workforce<br>we built information systems that<br>connected case and contact data across<br>the country<br>this is a practical necessity to fight a<br>rapidly spreading virus and also because<br>the devolved model of public health<br>protection services of health protection<br>services essentially meant that small<br>public health units could not afford<br>purpose-built information systems<br>the ministry of health has led the<br>development of much better coordinated<br>systems and protocols we have developed<br>a telehealth service the national<br>contact racing centre<br>you might call some of these changes<br>centralization<br>there is certainly greater coordination<br>and leadership and provision of enabling<br>resources like staff or information<br>technology systems<br>but we continue to value the expertise<br>of public health professionals who know<br>their community well and are able to<br>lead the response on the ground<br>collectively these measures have meant<br>we've been able to contact trace at an<br>what i call an industrial scale<br>remember when we trace 2 000 contacts of<br>a single case when one traveler from<br>sydney visited wellington in june<br>and in the early part of the august<br>outbreak we had 30 000 contacts and<br>active management in the system this is<br>a marked change from the<br>from the<br>communicable diseases control system we<br>had prior to the pandemic<br>another area we have learnt lessons is<br>the need to work hand in hand with<br>communities using their local knowledge<br>and expertise that has really been<br>highlighted by this pandemic<br>we've seen this in our vaccine rollout<br>where we have had to work carefully with<br>communities to overcome barriers to<br>access but also to build up trust in the<br>system in a vaccine that has been<br>subject to misinformation<br>maori and pacific health providers have<br>been the stars of the vaccine rollout<br>they have been reaching out to whanau<br>who we have traditionally underserved by<br>door knocking going to workplaces and<br>places of worship sports and recreation<br>grounds to vaccinate people<br>we have learnt lessons on the way<br>successful campaigns have focused on<br>trusted faces and familiar spaces<br>we have also learned that it's better to<br>commission these services more directly<br>now rather than going through dhbs<br>the spirit of these initiatives was<br>perhaps best captured by super saturday<br>somehow the call out to community<br>leaders minor celebrities mps in an<br>earnest cheesy eight-hour live<br>television broadcast inspired over 2.5<br>percent of the population to get<br>vaccinated in a single day<br>we unleash the power of our aunties<br>principals rugby coaches and pastors to<br>protect our people<br>these measures are making a difference<br>in a short time the percentage of maori<br>vaccinated with their first dose<br>increased from the mid 50 to 80 today<br>we are not where we want to be yet but<br>things are improving markedly<br>meanwhile pacific pacifica peoples are<br>now vaccinated to almost the same level<br>as the general population at 90 for the<br>first dose and 80 are fully vaccinated<br>my last lesson is we have mobilized all<br>of government around a single health<br>objective<br>a key element of this whole of<br>government approach has been the stand<br>standing up of the managed isolation and<br>quarantine to form a defence at our<br>border and to keep covert out of the<br>community<br>the miq system is led by the ministry of<br>business innovation and employment in<br>collaboration with the defence force and<br>a workforce provided by dhbs<br>while there is an understandable emerg<br>urge to remove the need for miq it is<br>important to remember that since march<br>last year<br>with 40<br>more than 189<br>000 people have been through our miq<br>facilities with 1 400 cases of covert<br>identified among them<br>the miq workforce nurses hotel staff<br>defence and security guards cooks and<br>cleaners can claim a large share of the<br>responsibility and the credit for the<br>exceptional public health outcomes<br>however the tools that were effective<br>against the original variant of covert<br>19 including the world's most stringent<br>lockdown<br>testing and contact racing have not been<br>as effective against the delta variant<br>an r value that is twice as high<br>a shorter incubation period and a<br>foothold in our most vulnerable<br>communities has made delta impossible to<br>eliminate<br>so we are shifting from the strategic<br>goal of elimination to minimisation and<br>protection<br>under the new covert 19 protection<br>framework which will come into effect in<br>this country in a week on december third<br>the minimization and protection goal as<br>articulated by um by the covert 19<br>strategic public health advisory group<br>sets the goal of minimising the presence<br>of covert 19 and protecting people and<br>health systems from its impact<br>it is not mitigation or learning to live<br>with it it is perhaps closest to what<br>other countries call tight suppression<br>vaccination is the foundation of this<br>new protection framework colloquially<br>known as a traffic light system<br>we have access to one of the world's<br>most effective vaccines for covert 19.<br>so far 84 of new zealanders are fully<br>vaccinated and 90 92 percent have had<br>their first dose<br>other countries such as israel and<br>singapore have achieved high vaccination<br>rates but see breakthrough infections<br>and we are really increased the same<br>happens here we have already provided a<br>third primary dose of the vaccine for<br>people with lower immunity<br>and booster doses will be available in<br>just a few days time from those six<br>months on from their first dose boosters<br>are strongly recommended for anyone<br>who's had the elasto six six months ago<br>and vaccination clinics pharmacies and<br>gps will provide them from the 29th<br>children as young as 12 are able to be<br>vaccinated against covert 19 and our<br>technical experts are currently advising<br>on whether children age 5 to 5 to 12<br>should also be vaccinated we have hope<br>to have more information on this in the<br>coming weeks<br>vaccination remains our strongest and<br>most effective form of protection and we<br>need as many workers as possible to be<br>vaccinated<br>so sectors can respond on the pandemic<br>and deliver everyday services with as<br>little disruption as possible so we have<br>made it mandatory for workers to be<br>vaccinated across the health and<br>disability sector our education<br>workforce borders and corrections we<br>have also mandated vaccination of<br>workers at businesses where customers<br>need to show cover 19 vaccination<br>certificates in order to make those<br>workplaces as safe as possible<br>we estimate 40 per cent<br>of our workforce will be covered by<br>vaccine mandates in addition we've<br>provided a legal framework to allow<br>enable employers to work with their<br>workforce to make decisions about<br>requiring vaccination in other<br>workplaces<br>and we enable all of these changes<br>through the vaccine pass<br>which<br>many of you i hope have have already<br>downloaded<br>the covert<br>covert protection framework is how we<br>continue to mobilize all of government<br>um and therefore the community to<br>respond to um covert 19 in our new<br>system<br>it will the framework will enable us to<br>move more freely than we have under the<br>alert level system with less disruption<br>and provides the stability many of us<br>need to plan for the future<br>however strong public health protections<br>remain<br>i'm not aware of other countries whose<br>plans for post-vaccine roll-out include<br>the ability to escalate public health<br>restrictions like ours does in fact<br>others just call their plans reopening<br>plans or freedom day<br>we've learned from other countries<br>reopenings and then being forced to read<br>and seeing them being forced to<br>re-implement restrictions as is<br>currently happening in europe we know<br>that might be necessary but it would not<br>happen as abruptly as it previously did<br>here under the alert level system<br>the covert 19 protection framework<br>builds on existing mask and<br>record-keeping mandates it places limits<br>on gatherings<br>in the situation that we need to protect<br>the health system<br>it very clearly gives an extra nudge to<br>those who need further encouragement for<br>vaccination<br>i've been working with colleagues on the<br>detailed guidance that underpins this<br>underpins a framework that spans a<br>number of industries we are still<br>mobilizing all of the community around a<br>public health<br>goal with the introduction of the<br>framework systems and processes which<br>were designed for elimination now need<br>to be adjusted<br>to our new goals of minimizing the<br>spread of covert 19 in the community and<br>protecting those who are most vulnerable<br>that's why yesterday i announced an<br>almost one billion dollar investment to<br>strengthen our testing and contact<br>tracing system<br>we will boost laboratory pcr testing<br>capacity across the country reaching 60<br>000 daily tests in the first quarter of<br>next year<br>and pcr testing will remain our<br>preferred diagnostic test<br>we will expand the use of rapid antigen<br>tests for screening tests for health<br>workers including in age residential<br>care and workplaces and enable the<br>public to purchase a rapid antigen test<br>at a pharmacy and have the test<br>conducted under supervision<br>we've also extended the funding for<br>public health units who will focus their<br>efforts on complex outbreaks that might<br>occur in vulnerable communities or<br>places where people<br>are in close proximity<br>their expertise and knowledge of their<br>communities remain invaluable in our<br>response and we will take care to learn<br>the lessons from the present outbreak of<br>working with marginalised communities<br>and to provide a service that integrates<br>welfare clinical and public health needs<br>the efforts of public health<br>professionals and community providers<br>will be complemented by further<br>investment in telehealth services<br>boosting our contact racing capacity and<br>bringing in a new telehealth case<br>investigation service<br>we are also developing a digital portal<br>to enable a case to upload their own<br>exposure events<br>this enables us to operate this public<br>health system with a differentiated<br>model<br>where those who are comfortable with<br>technology<br>who have resources and relatively few<br>needs will be managed more efficiently<br>but safely and we're able to provide<br>more intensive support to those who need<br>it most<br>we continue to strengthen the public<br>health response to covert 19 and in<br>doing so are creating new models for<br>future public health programs<br>so how do we build on the lessons learnt<br>in their pandemic response as we<br>restructure our health system<br>we need to strengthen public health<br>expertise and structures to make<br>scientific input into policy decisions<br>more routine<br>continue to strengthen our public health<br>systems<br>build on our ability to work with<br>communities<br>and transition our whole of government<br>pandemic response to strong systems for<br>addressing the social determinants of<br>health<br>the most important shift in the health<br>reforms is reorientating the whole<br>system towards achieving pi order<br>healthy futures for all so all people<br>their whanau and communities are<br>supported to achieve their health and<br>well-being aspirations<br>overall this signals a reorientation of<br>the whole system towards population<br>health and a greater focus on prevention<br>of disease harm and injury<br>this is the biggest change to the health<br>system in a generation and the<br>difficulty and complexity of this<br>with respect to strengthening<br>institution expertise and institutions<br>the new public health agency will be at<br>the heart of the ministry of health and<br>will be responsible for leading<br>population and public health in<br>partnership with the maori health<br>authority and the national public health<br>service<br>in particular the public health agency<br>will lead population and public health<br>strategy policy regulatory technical<br>specifications for public health<br>programs intelligence surveillance and<br>monitoring functions across the health<br>system<br>we've seen the pivotal role of science<br>in the covert 19 response and we want to<br>make this approach of linking science<br>and health much more routine and<br>systematic<br>the strength of the new public health<br>system will come from consolidating<br>public health expertise and leadership<br>and bringing building strong connections<br>with local communities<br>the public health agency will develop a<br>public health strategy and policy<br>framework which will contribute to the<br>new zealand health plan<br>and this is so important because<br>because for so many popular important<br>health issues unless we have a plan<br>we are not able to confront them because<br>many of them are long-term issues<br>this will incorporate<br>a long-term view recognising that<br>achieve to to achieve pi order and<br>equity we need to focus on the<br>environments we live work and play in<br>and important factors that often sit<br>outside the health system that determine<br>our health<br>a core foundation for the public health<br>system will be a more fit for purpose<br>knowledge and surveillance system to be<br>led by the public health agency<br>in particular there will be a strong<br>focus a stronger focus on ensuring<br>intelligence directly informs decisions<br>and actions in a timely way<br>the system will draw both on the<br>technical expertise of people and<br>universities and local community<br>expertise and knowledge<br>the system will bring together a broad<br>range of data scientific and public<br>health data as well as insights from<br>engagements with communities in<br>matarangamati<br>this joined up approach offers the best<br>opportunity to help all new zealanders<br>to live longer healthier lives<br>the public health agency will provide<br>secretarial support for a new public<br>health advisory committee which will<br>play a critical role in the system this<br>committee will provide independent<br>advice to ministers and will also help<br>ensure early and effective response to<br>public health issues they will be<br>expected to provide public advice health<br>advice to the minister which reflects a<br>perspective of maori and wider community<br>views as well<br>the advice includes taking a<br>systems-based approach to public health<br>and to reporting annually on systems<br>enablers such as information systems<br>workforce and regulatory settings<br>the committee will be expected to<br>prioritize equity-based approaches<br>including considering the factors<br>underlying the health of people and<br>communities<br>this will be an additional source of<br>public health advice rather than<br>replacing the ministry's primary advice<br>role and the committee will expect be<br>expected to consult the director general<br>director of public health and director<br>of the public health agency on its<br>annual work<br>work plan as well as the minister<br>an expression of interest will be<br>shortly released seeking peop interested<br>people wanting to be considered<br>for membership of this important<br>committee<br>as we have learned through the covet 19<br>response collaborating with and<br>supporting communities is also vital in<br>order to achieve public health impact<br>we can achieve this in part through a<br>locality model of care<br>through the health and disability<br>systems reform we want to see service<br>provision at locality networks where<br>different strands of healthcare are<br>integrated so new zealanders can easily<br>access support and treatment tailored<br>for their needs<br>focusing on localities centres our<br>approach on the strengths of each<br>community<br>including its ewe and community<br>providers it encourages siloed<br>government programs to collaborate at<br>the local level to meet the needs that<br>are there<br>what would that look like well take our<br>vision for the well child tamariki order<br>program<br>a review of this program found services<br>across the early years should be<br>strengthened to keep pace with the needs<br>of whanau<br>and be more integrated across health<br>maternity and social and early learning<br>services<br>this could include<br>simplifying the pathways for screening<br>and early interventions and providing<br>more responsive wrap around services<br>this is particularly important for some<br>new zealanders with the highest needs<br>including whanau with child and<br>protection child care and protection<br>issues or drug use<br>they are more likely to accept support<br>if it is from someone familiar and these<br>types of models are already being tested<br>including through enhanced support<br>pilots no otherwise known as nurse<br>family partnerships and lakes and<br>counties monaco dhbs<br>soon i'll be releasing the smoke free<br>aotearoa action plan and similarly<br>through that i want to see seek to<br>empower communities to mobilise around a<br>smoke-free goal<br>by working at the community level we can<br>change the environment so smokers feel<br>better supported to quit and we<br>denormalizing we denormalise smoking so<br>young people don't start<br>we will only achieve that goal if we<br>enable maori leadership of this work and<br>we will<br>but communities will also know that we<br>have their back and we will regulate to<br>protect communities from the intrusive<br>and harmful presence of big to get big<br>tobacco<br>a new<br>in<br>in terms of building stronger public<br>health systems an important thing will<br>be the development of a single<br>a single public health<br>public health unit<br>within the<br>within health new zealand and reporting<br>to the director of public health<br>in the public health agency and this<br>will build on the success we've had in<br>the pandemic with having public health<br>units work in a more coordinated way<br>while still respecting their strengths<br>at the local at a local level they'll be<br>supported by the<br>by the public health agency which will<br>convene our local expertise and national<br>expertise for developing public health<br>programs<br>commissioned by health new zealand and<br>the maori health<br>authority the health reforms provide<br>opportunities to more extensively take<br>into account consideration the social<br>and economic determinants of health and<br>well-being<br>and we must have a health and all<br>policies approach and we're almost there<br>we currently have a covert in all<br>policies approach<br>we have laid the foundations for this<br>approach and in fact we did so before<br>the pandemic<br>minister robertson has brought wellbeing<br>to the core of our budget setting<br>process and last term minister hipkins<br>enabled cross sector cross agency work<br>through public sector reforms<br>this enables novel collaborations<br>between agencies like the joint venture<br>on<br>that brings together officials to work<br>on complex problems like preventing<br>domestic violence<br>the public health agency will be a focal<br>point for this type of work across<br>agency<br>however we aren't waiting for the<br>reforms to be complete the government<br>has an ambitious work plan on how the<br>housing and health officials are active<br>to ensure that the housing we build is<br>healthy connected to services and<br>transport<br>we work collaboratively on the prime<br>minister's child and youth wellbeing<br>strategy and we work closely with<br>minister mahuta on the three waters<br>reform because until water<br>entities are financially sustainable<br>they will never make the required<br>investments and infrastructure to ensure<br>drinking water is safe for all no matter<br>where they live<br>so in closing we should be proud of what<br>our pandemic response has achieved to<br>date and as we transition to a new<br>approach to covert 19 you can be assured<br>that our confidence to protect people<br>our determination to protect people is<br>as strong as ever<br>it is important that we continue to<br>learn from our experiences<br>and continuously improve in the pandemic<br>response<br>and as we reform the health system<br>we have a lot of work to do but there<br>are many opportunities and i feel<br>optimistic about our future<br>na mahinui kia koto<br>uh current minister it falls upon me to<br>um<br>say a few words and vote of thanks i<br>know um professor philip hill would have<br>liked to have been here to have done<br>this<br>as a<br>former colleague and collaborator but<br>he's not able to be here<br>i have to say in making these remarks<br>i'm a physicist and so in terms of my<br>approach to research it's reductionist<br>and there is a place for reductionism to<br>understand at its core what uh key<br>issues are<br>and we will often say<br>in physics we would like to think of<br>something in health as the patient being<br>a sphere in a vacuum and looking at the<br>at some of the root causes but um<br>you have impressed me very much and i'm<br>sure the rest of our audience with the<br>with the understanding and the knowledge<br>that uh to attack or to tackle real<br>problems for real communities in areas<br>such as public health you need a broad<br>spectrum of knowledge<br>as an individual researcher and policy<br>maker but also you need to draw on a<br>huge range of knowledges from different<br>communities<br>perhaps occasionally even physicists<br>when it comes to uh testing and other<br>strategies um i forgot to say in my<br>introduction that um<br>um you and other colleagues who are in<br>the public communication around the<br>pandemic in the early in the early<br>months were very reassuring to many of<br>us<br>and being a face that was able to<br>communicate uh the research the um the<br>impacts and then the the potential<br>futures to us in such an approachable<br>and um<br>and kind kind manner and i think one of<br>the things that i reflected on was your<br>the breadth of your of your uh love for<br>scholarly matters extended into the the<br>arts and literature with looking at the<br>library behind you and many of the many<br>of that and my wife<br>as a student of of english uh would have<br>looked dearly at your margaret atwood<br>collection i also note look that what<br>we've heard today is the immense amount<br>of effort that you have put in and<br>i um i am not i would not be surprised<br>if um someone has found a way to clone<br>people and there is more than one eye<br>shaving because<br>the amount of<br>work that you have demonstrated to us<br>over a short period of time<br>clearly can't be done by one person<br>alone and i think the multiple copies of<br>some of the books in your library behind<br>you<br>indicates that there must be at least<br>two aisha veros that each need a copy of<br>the book no i i joke but but honestly um<br>seeing the work that you've presented<br>here and when i see a a title talking<br>about lessons learned from the covert<br>response but that your the first things<br>you tell us are about um are some of the<br>other things in the a to z of public<br>health of fluorine and<br>folate that you have managed to<br>implement a tackle issues that are<br>have been of of significant public<br>interest in a manner that has got to a<br>point of of implementation is truly<br>impressive we've then heard of<br>the work that has been done under<br>extreme pressure and duress i'm sure<br>with<br>significant difficulty in decision<br>making and guidance<br>to help lead us through<br>our elimination and into this new<br>new era of<br>of of active management saying<br>suppression and we do trust that the<br>decision-making will be sound and that<br>you will still lean on us as a research<br>community for knowledge to help support<br>decision-making as<br>as<br>as needed but then we didn't stop at<br>in the midst of a pandemic<br>we can focus on on those issues we also<br>saw your vision and your drive and your<br>commitment and your clear articulation<br>of what<br>our health system and in particular the<br>public health component of our health<br>system should be for the future for<br>ourselves as individuals for our<br>whanau's finance and community and<br>actually for the national good and so<br>again in that we thank you immensely and<br>through your inspiration i think would<br>all commit to being here to support you<br>as needed so on behalf of the audience<br>here and online can you please join me<br>in thanking aisha for a wonderful talk<br>now um<br>minister viral is happy to take<br>questions now i think for those on the<br>online audience i apologize i don't<br>believe we've set up a mechanism for<br>relaying online questions<br>but i think we have quite a decent<br>audience here today that will probably<br>be able to ask<br>some of the kind questions and perhaps<br>even some of the challenging questions<br>that<br>those online might be willing to<br>engage with as well do we have any<br>questions from the audience here there's<br>one up there i'll run i'll run the<br>microphone and uh if you stay there<br>minister<br>yeah hi yeshua it's quite a wide-ranging<br>policy you've got going there<br>um my name is richard seeger<br>and<br>i'm just going to quote you something<br>from john r sue<br>vaccine safety team on the cdc the<br>center for disease control in the united<br>states<br>and that is that<br>they were expecting<br>um<br>the number of of cases of<br>myopericarditis to be between uh 12 and<br>24 um no sorry 2 in 19 cases<br>in the 12 to 24 year old age range group<br>and they actually got 434 cases that's a<br>significant increase in what they were<br>expecting and it's across all range age<br>groups in that in that age group so 12<br>to 15 is 140 free<br>16 to 17 is 139 and 18 to 24 is 152.<br>the risk for this<br>age profile is very very low this is<br>these are males by the way there's also<br>um females they've had a lower incidence<br>of those<br>um cases of myo-pericarditis<br>this would seem to because the risk<br>profile for this these age groups are so<br>low they're literally at no risk<br>whatsoever of getting covered<br>um why are we even proceeding with a<br>vaccine rollout for this these age<br>groups<br>why isn't that there's no reason<br>thank you very much for your question<br>and we take care to make sure that every<br>part of the population every group in<br>the population that we roll a vaccine<br>out to has a<br>very thorough assessment by our<br>medicines regulator medsafe and also by<br>technical experts<br>all of those<br>data is constantly monitored by by med<br>say it is true that there is a<br>the risk of myocarditis does increase<br>in in younger age groups particularly<br>men but it is uh i think<br>not controversial that there is a much<br>stronger benefit from vaccinating that<br>group and protecting them from covert<br>than the risk of risk of myocarditis<br>however we can we have<br>we make sure that we continue to monitor<br>that and we do so um uh both<br>domestically and keep um up with the<br>international data on that current<br>minister and there may be other<br>expertise in the room that can help help<br>with that question uh after that after<br>so from your uh title lessons and<br>opportunities<br>so as a mental<br>experiment<br>if we have everything the way for the<br>next<br>you know<br>case next<br>epidemic if everything was the same the<br>technology etc the contact tracing but<br>we didn't know the nature of the<br>organism and we didn't have any testing<br>tests available to identify the positive<br>cases what would we do or<br>based on the last two years what<br>lessons should we<br>should we attempt<br>to<br>explore and develop in our minds<br>oh thank you i had a<br>discussion with um<br>some of<br>some of the researchers in microbiology<br>today about some of these issues so for<br>a start<br>i'm i'm told by researchers here that<br>genomics is<br>sufficiently advanced that we can<br>develop sequencing technologies to<br>characterize unknown pathogens so i<br>guess the the response would begin with<br>someone realizing that they were dealing<br>with someone with an um with a<br>clinician realizing they had a patient<br>who had a<br>emerging infection that they couldn't<br>yet diagnose and we would need to have<br>the facilities which we have in academia<br>but not in our public health system to<br>be able to sequence that from there as<br>wuhan from having the sequence it is<br>possible then to start to make<br>diagnostic tests and indeed some of the<br>scientists here at otago<br>were part of early efforts to do that<br>here in in new zealand and then the<br>response starts again<br>i don't want to think much about the<br>next pandemic because it just feels a<br>bit much at the moment but i think one<br>one thing to know about our current<br>response<br>is that<br>if we have a new variant or something<br>and another threat we still have the<br>alert level system right so if we have a<br>if we don't have immunity to a new<br>pathogen<br>don't anticipate that we have to and<br>we're progressing with the traffic light<br>framework because we feel<br>because we're doing i have a highly<br>vaccinated population but we have those<br>options<br>if we haven't identified the positive<br>cases the alert system is just<br>you know if we can't i identified the<br>positive cases the way we have done on<br>this occasion the alert system the<br>contact trace saying surveillance<br>they're all<br>they'll prove of no use so when i worked<br>as an infectious diseases specialist i<br>guess there would be the types of types<br>of cases where that does um that does<br>raise that question and then that would<br>send you down that path of of sequencing<br>and then developing tests for it and<br>they're the patients who clearly have an<br>infectious syndrome uh but they um but<br>you can't culture another i can't<br>give another microbiological diagnosis<br>for them<br>thank you minister and um my health and<br>well-being is getting an advantage<br>because i'm running up and down the<br>stairs<br>because people are deciding that<br>questions are coming from um<br>diametrically opposed parts of the room<br>thank you very much um thank you<br>um<br>we've trained a lot of people who've got<br>a lot of expertise out of covert<br>particularly in things like contact<br>tracing them that we've upskilled a vast<br>number of<br>people just wonder if there are any<br>plans to when covert eventually settles<br>and phase in the contract tracing is no<br>longer needed are there any plans to use<br>those skills into contact racing for tb<br>or<br>sexually transmitted infections or other<br>things like that well certainly i hope<br>we come out of this with um with just<br>that um<br>extra strength in our human um and our<br>workforce for managing<br>other communicable and environmental<br>health threats so<br>you know the<br>that's why we're making long-term<br>investments for example in the public<br>health workforce<br>yes we have trained an army of contact<br>races<br>but also training some of those highly<br>highly skilled people that we<br>that will need in the future<br>um i think another uh way of thinking<br>about that question is the number of<br>people who have been brought in as staff<br>and maori and pacific providers we are<br>thinking about<br>and<br>in essence what we are contracting for<br>we draw on beyond covet<br>i know we've got a busy um three years<br>ahead to reach our smoke free 2025 goal<br>to get our um smoke-free rates down to 5<br>and you know<br>if we<br>uh the skills and community mobilization<br>that have been built up around<br>say the vaccine rollout may have carry<br>through into some of that work we want<br>to do in communities communities there<br>so i see scope for both the sort of<br>professional and the um and the<br>community workforce to transition to<br>some of our other other programs<br>um i might just follow on there and i<br>think there's a question here but i have<br>to formulate it um i also um<br>as has have some others of us<br>gone through personally the christchurch<br>earthquake and we're seeing that in the<br>covert response of things like the<br>student volunteer army coming up and<br>i guess we've developed our own form of<br>national service that has people has<br>standing<br>cohorts of people who are able to win<br>the need comes and we don't know what<br>that might be a public health it might<br>be a natural disaster there might be<br>some other thing that's over the horizon<br>but i think we can have confidence that<br>we've got communities that are prepared<br>to<br>lay down what they're doing and focus<br>their effort and then we've just got to<br>build capacity in that than that sort of<br>standing public service and public duty<br>is there anything more structurally we<br>might need to do around that um i was<br>really it's interesting you mentioned<br>the christchurch earthquake because one<br>of i was very impressed when i visited<br>the public health unit in<br>canterbury dhb at the range of<br>relationships that that public health<br>unit had built with ewe with community<br>organizations with vulnerable<br>communities with<br>local government following<br>from the christchurch earthquake and<br>as a result they<br>weren't doing that work for the first<br>time when they um when<br>covered covert struck so that was a very<br>impressive group and i think it's those<br>sorts of relationships that would focus<br>on more when we bring that locality<br>approach to health service planning and<br>i should say the other point i<br>meant to note in my vote of thanks when<br>you talked about activating communities<br>was<br>understanding from what's happening here<br>of the kaiko as a model as well the<br>village that's that's um community<br>driven um it is uh runaka led in and<br>it's a partnership model and it's<br>delivering health and other services and<br>i was just in in vicar morehead<br>yesterday and and that delivery of um<br>career advice and training and<br>and being integrated in those community<br>services that we provide i think offers<br>anyway we are<br>approaching the time where um the<br>minister has to get into a vehicle to<br>get to the dunedin airport to get back<br>to<br>busy work in wellington we know how um<br>how much effort you put in minister so<br>if there are no further questions can<br>you please all um in the room join me<br>again and thanking minister viral for<br>that um very very
