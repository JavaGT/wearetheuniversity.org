i'm<br>going to talk to you today about a<br>digital health<br>programme at the university of otago<br>um<br>so just first of all just a bit of<br>background about me<br>um<br>i'm a medical doctor i've got clinical<br>experience in<br>nhs in the uk<br>um and in new zealand<br>and i've specialized in clinical<br>informatics or digital health<br>so i worked in digital health for most<br>of my career<br>working on it projects in new zealand<br>uk kenya and vietnam<br>i'm a fellow of the uk faculty of<br>clinical informatics<br>which is<br>a<br>association for<br>academics and clinicians<br>who specialise in digital health i've<br>also got an executive mba from the<br>university of auckland and i also work<br>part-time for the university of oxford<br>for my projects in kenya and vietnam<br>so my research interests in digital<br>health are in global health um also in<br>usability<br>and also doing work with virtual reality<br>for training healthcare professionals<br>so if you have any questions as we go<br>along<br>feel free to<br>put on your mic and ask them or you can<br>type them into the chat<br>and<br>i'll come to them at the end<br>okay<br>so<br>just a bit of background about what<br>digital health is so digital health is<br>about the use of digital technologies to<br>improve uh healthcare<br>and so it covers a huge<br>kind of range of things but some of the<br>things that you might have seen<br>in the news or you might have heard<br>about digital health are things like<br>telemedicine where<br>doctors and healthcare professionals use<br>video conferencing a bit like we're<br>doing now<br>to talk to<br>patients<br>artificial intelligence which is where<br>the computers are helping clinicians<br>make decisions<br>so it might be that they're analyzing<br>um<br>ct scans or radiology images and can<br>detect if there's a disease process<br>there just the computer on its own and<br>then helping the doctor to make clinical<br>decisions<br>also about wearable sensors so these are<br>things that people can wear<br>a bit like fitbits and things like that<br>that can track your movement and pick up<br>your signs<br>of your heart rate and things like that<br>and also<br>more kind of routinely use systems such<br>as electronic health records so<br>electronic health records are the kind<br>of digital version<br>of<br>medical records that are used in<br>doctors clinics and<br>hospitals<br>so over the last few years digital<br>health has been growing quite<br>rapidly um<br>so you might have seen in new zealand<br>has recently been quite an increase in<br>the budget<br>attached to data and digital<br>but also in the private sector and over<br>the course of the pandemic there's been<br>a huge investment in<br>new companies<br>addressing digital health challenges<br>and this graph on the right shows that<br>there's over<br>14 billion<br>dollars invested in<br>um but you don't have to take my word<br>for it one of our guest lecturers on the<br>course is shane hunter he's the deputy<br>director general for data and digital at<br>the ministry of health in new zealand<br>and he gave us a great lecture about the<br>work that they're doing<br>but also um<br>is really passionate about growing the<br>next generation of digital health<br>experts and has been very supportive of<br>us as we're trying to train<br>clinicians and people from itu<br>backgrounds and other backgrounds in<br>we also include on the course<br>people from the digital health private<br>sector so people who've been setting up<br>companies<br>or involved in digital health outside<br>the government sector so an example of<br>this is dr angela lim who is a junior<br>doctor<br>based in new zealand who set up a new<br>company called clear head<br>to help people with mental health<br>challenges<br>and<br>she's very passionate about the way that<br>technology can address um and change<br>health systems and how that's going to<br>happen over the next few years<br>and we also have um dr will reedy who's<br>um<br>medical doctor but also now chief<br>executive officer of spark health which<br>is<br>a major<br>digital health company in new zealand<br>and he's very passionate about the new<br>technologies on the horizon so things<br>like artificial intelligence and machine<br>learning and how we can really use<br>things like telehealth to engage people<br>in their own<br>health care<br>so excuse<br>me so<br>what does the program consist of so<br>we've got two<br>qualifications at the moment one is the<br>postgraduate certificate<br>this takes place over six months<br>starting from next year<br>and is based on two papers and i'll just<br>talk about those in a second and the<br>other qualification is the postgraduate<br>diploma which takes place over 12 months<br>which includes the papers from the first<br>from the postgraduate certificate but<br>then also has additional papers that you<br>can take<br>so this is the postgraduate certificate<br>in digital health<br>so the two papers are 701 and 783<br>so 701 is principles of digital health<br>and informatics which is the 30-point<br>paper<br>and 703 is digital health technologies<br>and systems<br>and so the principles of digital health<br>and informatics give you kind of a<br>baseline about what digital health is<br>all about<br>the different types of<br>information systems used in healthcare<br>the kind of<br>international standards and<br>terminologies and things like that that<br>are used for sharing data uh within<br>healthcare and we also have a lot of<br>guest lecturers from the sector come in<br>talk about all the different projects<br>that people have been involved in<br>and cover um<br>quite a lot of detail about the basic<br>principles of informatics<br>and then in 703 it's much more practical<br>paper so the students fit into groups<br>and they work on a challenge<br>this year we've been working on the<br>challenge of<br>covert vaccination and certification<br>so two the teams have been working<br>together to<br>go through that kind of design process<br>of how you think about who your<br>digital health project is going to be<br>aimed at<br>and then iterating through with designs<br>and prototypes<br>to come up with something that they can<br>think would be useful<br>as a digital health project<br>and we cover in that paper we cover a<br>lot about what you need to do in order<br>to get a digital health project<br>um<br>into the hands of people in terms of<br>regulation and who you need to<br>how you need to get funding and things<br>so the postgraduate diploma then builds<br>on those two initial papers and so it<br>takes place in the semester two next<br>year and then you can choose from a<br>selection of papers that are on offer<br>um and you choose um two of the two you<br>can choose two papers out of this out of<br>786 and 707 so 786 is research methods<br>for digital health which is a 30-point<br>paper<br>and that covers how you do<br>research on digital health and 707 is<br>about digital health information<br>governance and ethics<br>and then we have two papers that are 15<br>point papers so these you could consider<br>as one uh one paper together in terms of<br>your options of how you would choose and<br>that's those are on patient-centered<br>digital health which is about digital<br>health technologies that um help<br>patients um engage with the health<br>service so things like telemedicine and<br>self-monitoring and that kind of thing<br>and then we also talk about emerging<br>technologies and digital health so these<br>are the<br>things like ai and virtual reality and<br>new technologies<br>so um yeah so you can choose<br>two 30 points<br>you can choose up 60 points out of the<br>90 points available and you also can<br>potentially swap the research methods in<br>digital health for another paper that we<br>have on offer<br>within the information science<br>department<br>okay so how do we teach so we use<br>microsoft teams for teaching<br>so sometimes when you do online courses<br>you have to log into lots of different<br>systems and it gets a bit complicated<br>and difficult<br>so we just use one system which is<br>microsoft teams and you'll be given an<br>account<br>when you're involved with the university<br>and it works with your whole microsoft<br>365 account<br>so<br>your word and excel and things are all<br>linked into the same user account<br>um<br>so we deliver live lectures um so it's<br>not just watching uh recordings of<br>lectures<br>uh we have live lectures like this where<br>we participate and discuss things and we<br>also split uh people up into the small<br>groups to work on projects together<br>and the course is designed for working<br>professionals so<br>the lectures take place in the evenings<br>or if they're during the day<br>then you can watch them back on on teams<br>and participate in the<br>chat stream<br>on teams to engage with people<br>we have me as the main lecturer for the<br>course we also have other lecturers from<br>our department in information science<br>and the medical school<br>and we also bring in outside lecturers<br>this is an example of one of our papers<br>so this is digital health 701 and i'll<br>just show you how we go through the<br>content week by week so they start off<br>with an introduction to digital health<br>then we talk about health information<br>systems and how we can use health data<br>for improving health care<br>then we talk about interoperability of<br>digital health systems so how they share<br>data<br>with each other and connect to work<br>together<br>we talk about international and new<br>zealand digital health standards<br>ethics security privacy and trust so<br>that's by<br>dr tanya morinhoot and she is also the<br>lecturer for the 787 paper that you can<br>take<br>as an option for the<br>in week six we talk about quality<br>improvement so how you can use digital<br>systems for improving quality and also<br>cover the major new zealand health it<br>projects<br>then we talk about digital<br>transformation and usability of digital<br>health systems so how you can get<br>clinicians to use systems quite often<br>systems are not necessarily designed<br>with usability in mind so we talk about<br>how you how you can do that<br>we talked then about digital health<br>innovation and theories of informatics<br>and that's when dr angela lim gives a<br>guest lecture<br>on uh how she set up her company and how<br>she developed uh innovative uh idea and<br>digital health uh then we talk about<br>digital learning and global digital<br>health with a couple of really great uh<br>guest lecturers there<br>and then the final few presentations and<br>lectures are on<br>recording analyzing interpreting data<br>and<br>how you procure and implement and<br>project managed systems and also we<br>finished with the discussion of future<br>digital health<br>technologies<br>and in the final<br>week we have presentations from<br>the students on based on one of the<br>projects that they've done<br>and so this is just a quote from<br>sarah he's actually on the call now so<br>if you wanted to ask her any questions<br>and<br>i think we've had really good response<br>to the course so this is the first year<br>that we've run it<br>um it's take we've just been doing um<br>a 701 paper over the first semester and<br>then the 783 paper the second semester<br>this year but they'll both run together<br>in the first semester<br>next year<br>but the students i think have really<br>enjoyed it and it's been great bringing<br>in all the guest lecturers from around<br>the sector<br>to have discussions with students<br>so i will leave it there and<br>you can ask me any questions now if you<br>like<br>or you can get in contact with me there<br>on my email or have a look at our
