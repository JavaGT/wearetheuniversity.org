webinar links so<br>we are going to be recording this uh<br>this session and so just be aware of<br>that if you're asking questions later on<br>and we are capturing this and so that<br>you can access these resources later as<br>well<br>it's really um exciting to finally be<br>able to<br>um welcome you to our 2021 commerce<br>teachers then like many things this year<br>we felt it wasn't going to happen for<br>quite a while we changed the date at<br>least once internally i think we changed<br>the date about three times but i think<br>we promoted one date and then and moved<br>it but it's really exciting to be able<br>to see some old old familiar faces who<br>i've seen a couple of these before and<br>also we've got some new um faces in the<br>room online and as well so whether or<br>not you're in auckland and enjoying that<br>first day of coming out of the alerts<br>into the travel lights or you're<br>elsewhere in the country or here in<br>wellington we've got a really<br>interesting program for you this morning<br>um<br>to take you through some of the things<br>that we think are going to be quite<br>interesting for our commerce teachers<br>and purpose of the day<br>is as always to give you to you to learn<br>something new for you to network with<br>colleagues and obviously that looks a<br>little bit different online for those of<br>you who are online compared to those of<br>you are in the room but we'd like those<br>of you who are online to use some of<br>those breaks we have as a breakaway from<br>the screen because we know all know what<br>it's like when you've kind of got<br>intensive watching um happening<br>it's also an opportunity not just to<br>network amongst your fellow commerce<br>teachers but also to meet some of our<br>staff so we've got some of our uh<br>wellington school of business and<br>government uh senior leaders joining us<br>at uh morning tea<br>and uh lunchtime as well um it's<br>opportunity to access some case studies<br>and examples and data that you might<br>take to the classroom<br>and we'll also talk a little bit about<br>what we do here at the wellington school<br>of business and government as well<br>i will do a couple of introductions just<br>as we're getting going i'm ably<br>supported to here today by jackie and<br>rachel rachel fecker is in the rooms<br>waving to those those who are in on<br>campus with us rachel is our engagement<br>manager and there's all the brains<br>behind activities such as this and she's<br>really your go-to person if you want any<br>follow-ups around some of the things<br>that we talk about today i'll talk a<br>little bit later about some resources we<br>can share with you those in on campus<br>we've got some takeaways for you and you<br>should hopefully have found a green bag<br>if you're one of those who headed<br>straight to the back of the room i think<br>we only put green bags in the first five<br>rows so at the break come and grab one<br>from further um further forward<br>those of you who are online we don't<br>want you to miss out either so we've got<br>some things we can kind of follow up and<br>share digitally but also if you'd like<br>any of the physical resources that we<br>talk about again rachel's you'll go to<br>around that as well as things like<br>school visits which i'll mention in a<br>moment and then many of you will have<br>met jackie already who's out there and<br>running the welcome desk jackie will be<br>here throughout the day and she's like<br>she's our person then if you're not sure<br>where the morning tea is or where your<br>special diet requirements are etc jackie<br>is the one to hunt down she'll know<br>where they<br>are where they are<br>i'd also like to introduce nicola<br>lancaster who's also joining us today so<br>cure nicola nicola is careers um<br>engagement manager for chartered<br>accountants australia new zealand uh<br>nicholas colleague rebecca will be<br>speaking on our panel about the future<br>of accounting later on but nicola is<br>here throughout the day so grab her at<br>morning tea or at lunch if you'd like to<br>hear a little bit more there's actually<br>for those in on campus in your um your<br>pack there is actually some um<br>information from cairns that you might<br>want to follow up with and we can get<br>we're going to share a digital copy of<br>that and to those of you who are online<br>as well um later<br>so hopefully um if you<br>hopefully everyone can access this if<br>you are online and you've got any<br>questions do pop them in the chat uh<br>rachel will be manning those and i'll<br>also be watching that as well um as we<br>get our presenters in<br>now i don't think i actually told you<br>who i was so i probably should have that<br>on the next slide so i should have said<br>cura my name is karen smith i'm<br>professor of tourism management here and<br>i'm actually here today in my role as<br>associate dean learning teaching for the<br>wellington school of business and<br>government and i think this is my third<br>and commerce teacher's day and it's<br>always really nice to to actually hear<br>from those who are essentially our<br>pipeline who<br>for the students coming into our program<br>we're doing some really exciting work at<br>the moment at the university and<br>particularly we're starting off a<br>project slightly delayed project let's<br>be honest um around our bachelor of<br>commerce so we'll be coming out to you<br>next year to get commerce teachers input<br>into what you see as kind of the<br>commerce future of today and the<br>commerce degree of today and tomorrow<br>and get some input into what you see is<br>really important in that space we know<br>that you're also having lots of changes<br>happening in the ncaa level space as<br>well so another opportunity for<br>engagement<br>so i'm just going to say a couple of<br>things that you like which relate to<br>those of this in the room here so<br>welcome to campus now the emergency<br>procedures if we do have a<br>fire alarm does sound do we do need to<br>leave there's two exits either side this<br>is where i feel a little bit like i'm on<br>the airplane because there are also two<br>at the back as well um once you leave<br>out if you just go out the nearest exit<br>is to the left as you come out which<br>will take you out towards the buses but<br>there's an alternative if you go to the<br>right which many of you will probably<br>have come in our assembly point is<br>across bunny street which is the road<br>take you into the old government<br>buildings um<br>area there so that's where we would go<br>um and if we do need to leave in a<br>tsunami we are head towards parliament<br>which is slightly higher than we are<br>obviously we've got our covered<br>protocols as well and i think we're all<br>learning what it is to be in a different<br>traffic light levels i know a few people<br>were a bit thrown this morning at big<br>boobs that you was your first chance to<br>show your covered um<br>your covert pass um we are using the<br>tracer app so if you haven't signed in<br>already there are signs around the room<br>and elsewhere in the building um as well<br>you've got hand sanitizer available and<br>as you can see<br>i'm a bit of social distancing in this<br>space as well and i know a lot of people<br>are still wearing masks and that's all<br>great as well<br>if you do want to access wi-fi if not<br>work to date and do you can use the<br>wellington university guest wi-fi so if<br>you just find that on your wi-fi<br>settings click don't have an account at<br>the bottom and you do need to pop in an<br>email address that can be any email<br>address<br>and then just agree and it'll take you<br>through the register to um to do that so<br>you can click onto that at any point<br>now for those of you who are online this<br>actually is not what it looks like<br>because i hadn't realized we were<br>running this online as a webinar so<br>ignore the first two things because you<br>can't do those but you can't do the<br>thing on there so we've got the chat<br>function working uh for those of you<br>online please do it great opportunity to<br>introduce yourself it would be lovely to<br>see where your job you're joining us<br>from uh today<br>you can also chat in there and you can<br>put questions in there but you can also<br>use the question and answer box as well<br>so and we'll be monitoring those through<br>the session and we'll give you<br>opportunities when we have some question<br>time we'll pull up the questions from<br>online as well as in the room<br>so we've got a busy day ahead or busy<br>morning ahead so and once i finish up<br>we're in the welcoming ben walker he's a<br>lecturer in organizational behavior here<br>at university and he's going to talk<br>about lay theories of expertise he's<br>actually backed by popular demand some<br>of you will have seen ben present in the<br>last couple of years at other commerce<br>teachers days and he's bringing<br>something new to us today<br>we've then got dominic stevens deputy<br>secretary chief economic adviser at the<br>treasury he's going to give us some<br>changing thinking on the housing market<br>i'm sure that's all very top of mind for<br>many of us and looking at things like<br>interest rate taxes and land supply and<br>we're always really pleased to be able<br>to draw on those government links that<br>we have here at the university<br>well then about just after eleven be<br>taking a half an hour break so those of<br>you online can go and grab your cup of<br>tea and biscuit those of you on campus<br>we've got morning tea on the mezzanine<br>floor and you can access it through the<br>front and go up the stairs or you can<br>actually head out the back of the<br>lecture theater and walk around as well<br>well then we're back in here at 11 35 um<br>for uh christian associate professor<br>christian shot he's one of my colleagues<br>in tourism management he's going to talk<br>about keeping it real and looking at<br>situated learning in the real world and<br>talk about some of the projects that<br>he's been involved in in places like<br>fiji and peru using um virtual reality<br>and looking at sort of our virtual field<br>trips as a learning tool<br>and then we're rounding off the session<br>with i think it's going to be really<br>interesting panel on the future of<br>accounting that'll be chaired by my<br>colleague cinderella george who's a<br>senior lecturer in accounting and we've<br>got three great panelists from xrv we've<br>got um<br>rebecca kennedy um nicholas um uh<br>colleague from chartered accountants um<br>australian new zealand and i realized<br>that<br>she'd say accountants and then we also<br>have daniel mccoy from um the<br>bdo wellington so they're going to come<br>on<br>i've seen some of the prep questions<br>that cinderella has put out to them and<br>i think they're going to be transversing<br>a whole range of different things from<br>things like climate change looking at<br>different forms of reporting i think<br>there's going to be some interesting<br>things coming out and then we'll finish<br>off with just some closing remarks and<br>then again apologies to those of you<br>joining us on the webinar and we are<br>going to be breaking here for lunch um<br>and join us upstairs um again in the<br>mezzanine floor for a bit more<br>networking and there<br>we've definitely kept it a bit shorter<br>this year because it can be quite<br>challenging if you're spending lots of<br>time on zoom over the morning um but i<br>think hopefully we've put together an<br>interesting program there but as always<br>we're really keen for feedback and we<br>will send out a survey for feedback but<br>if you have any suggestions or comments<br>during the day i'll be about rachel and<br>jackie will too so please do let us know<br>all right so many of you know the<br>university quite well your regular<br>attenders here but it's always worth us<br>just talking a little bit about who we<br>are and what we do so victoria<br>university of wellington teherangawaka<br>has a long history and teharangawaku is<br>essentially means the mooring place of<br>canoes and that's kind of how we're<br>increasingly thinking of ourselves as a<br>university a place that people from<br>different places from different parts of<br>the country indeed different parts of<br>the world can journey to hitch their<br>walker whilst they study with us and<br>then sail away<br>with what the knowledge that they have<br>taken and keep connected as well we're<br>also a capital city university you can<br>see in the image there just how compact<br>wellington is and as well as the kelvin<br>campus up on the hill we're obviously<br>down here the wellington school of<br>business and government in the heart of<br>the and the commerce and the public<br>sector district and we really sort of<br>value that um that input from the<br>commercial and the public sector and the<br>not-for-profit sector as well and we<br>bring that into our classrooms and<br>here's some examples i think about that<br>um today but thinking about the<br>intersection of commerce government and<br>the social implications of those<br>economic decisions which are made just<br>right across the road<br>we've got some exciting things happening<br>in our program so i'm just going to<br>highlight a couple for you that you<br>might be interested in and your students<br>might be interested in we have just<br>launched a new miner in business ethics<br>and sustainability management now that<br>can sit within the become a bachelor of<br>commerce but it can actually be taken as<br>part of any undergraduate degree and<br>this responds to the real sort of<br>wealth of interest that we see with our<br>students around both ethics and<br>sustainability so essentially it's a<br>four courses that you take as part of<br>your undergraduate degree and it links<br>really well into the united nations<br>sustainable development goals work and<br>christian shot will talk to you a little<br>bit about um that and later on<br>so that'll actually be we're<br>teaching that from next year<br>we're also starting to teach a new<br>marketing communications major so we've<br>had a marketing major in our bcom for<br>many many years um but we now have a<br>bachelor of communication as well in the<br>university and we've developed and<br>they're launching a marketing<br>communications major which you can take<br>as a part of the bachelor of commerce<br>but you can also take as part of the<br>bachelor so the budget is part of the<br>bachelor of communication but you can<br>also take it as an outside major here as<br>well and it's actually delivered mainly<br>by staff from our school marketing and<br>international business here at the<br>business school<br>this allows looking at communication<br>from very much a business orientated<br>perspective<br>and i think it's a really great one for<br>students who perhaps are kind of wanting<br>that sort of va sort of looking at some<br>of the different top subject areas in<br>there but they're also wanting to think<br>about the communications and business<br>angle as well so we're expecting this to<br>we also got lots of opportunities for<br>you to engage with us and to bring your<br>students on site or to work with us so<br>in your packs and again for those of you<br>online we'll send this out to you and we<br>host high school visits here at the<br>university so this is an addition to the<br>university's various outreach programs<br>that we have we can also host your<br>commerce students here on campus um and<br>again linking into rachel and her team<br>for that so it's an opportunity what we<br>tend to do is we tend to bring them in<br>and we start off in our atom<br>entrepreneurial space which is just down<br>by the the entrance that many of you<br>would have come in and that's a space<br>where our student entrepreneurs actually<br>use for teaching but also started<br>businesses as well so we have dedicated<br>support and space for uh<br>young entrepreneurs<br>and we then generally bring in one of<br>our academics to do a sort of a taster<br>lecture usually about some 20 minutes or<br>so and we can generally tailor that to<br>what you're interested in so if you're<br>doing a particular topic and you'd like<br>to sort of have one of our sort of<br>expert speakers we can work with you to<br>find the best person to talk to your<br>students there<br>and then there's also an opportunity to<br>have a bit of a look around the campus<br>and also find out a little bit more<br>about studying at um victoria university<br>of wellington from our recruitment team<br>as well<br>we also have some posters i think we<br>gave them out a couple of times last<br>year at our event there are some<br>available in the foyer if you are on<br>campus but these are largest um where<br>can business take you posters if you<br>would like one and sent to you again get<br>in touch and i'll put the email up in a<br>moment and get in touch with us and we<br>can we've still got a few of those that<br>we can send out really great to put in<br>the classroom about some of the<br>different opportunities that students<br>can do with a commerce degree and some<br>of them are ones you might kind of<br>expect like accounting and perhaps<br>thinking about kind of a management<br>consultant but also things like policy<br>advisor business analysts marketing<br>specialists and so on<br>and that's the way to connect with us<br>please do keep in touch the best way to<br>email us is commerce at<br>www.ac.nz but we also obviously on the<br>other the social media as well and it's<br>a great way to keep in touch with us and<br>all right well very well timed i'm going<br>to introduce now our first speaker of<br>the day um just before i do that just<br>checking if there are any questions<br>online or if anyone in the room has<br>anything questions before we we kick off<br>so i'm going to pass over to our first<br>because some of you will have met him at<br>previous events so he really is backed<br>by popular demand and he had no pressure<br>then i should also point out that ben<br>told me yesterday that he was up at 5 00<br>a.m this morning and has been in a<br>four-hour international management<br>academy of management meetings so it's<br>raring to go here out on point um then<br>is a lecturer in our school of<br>management um i'm not going to tell you<br>much more because i think you've<br>actually got a couple of slides talking<br>a little bit about your journey and it's<br>really great to have you with us ben<br>we've got the clicker working there and<br>i see some familiar faces from<br>yeah as karen said it's nice to actually<br>see some real people in front of me<br>after the last four hours um apologies<br>to those on zoom i hope i don't cause<br>you the same sort of experience i just<br>had<br>um<br>and i'll rachel you're gonna see<br>monitoring the chatter yeah cool i have<br>to make sure i'm just like moving around<br>so i'll try and make sure i stay in the<br>screen for our zoomies as well<br>so the the research i'm going to talk<br>about with you today is really something<br>that's very much ongoing i've been<br>working on it for about the last two<br>years uh one thing i forgot to put in<br>the program is the question mark<br>there very important because i don't<br>actually know the answer to that yet<br>right it's very much a question and<br>something that we're still looking into<br>but still there's some interesting<br>things coming out of it it was actually<br>a cool opportunity with karen<br>approaching this i thought to kind of<br>share with you and see what you think<br>um<br>just a little bit about myself i did go<br>to school here in wellington i actually<br>went to nine eye college out in lower<br>huts i did my undergraduate and honours<br>and masters here at hitting owakka i<br>worked for a couple of years in the<br>public sector i decided i really missed<br>university so i went into the phd at<br>unsw in sydney australia and then at the<br>end of that i got a job here back in<br>2018 so i've returned and been here for<br>about three and a half years but when i<br>was over there in australia i thought<br>i'd tell you a little bit of a story<br>like i always think the most interesting<br>part of people presenting research<br>researchers hearing where it came from<br>the back story in a way the behind the<br>scenes so the behind the scenes<br>for this project uh really was when my<br>daughter was born so this is my daughter<br>evie she was born<br>would be four years ago in february<br>but as you can tell<br>when she was born she'd have all this<br>stuff held up to her it was a little bit<br>unusual you can probably guess she was<br>premature so she was born nine weeks<br>early<br>um<br>and this created this really interesting<br>experience for me i mean it was scary<br>but as time went on she was so she spent<br>the first five weeks of her life in<br>hospital<br>in the neonatal intensive care unit<br>there in sydney and so i got to spend a<br>lot of time just sitting around in this<br>hospital observing things which for<br>someone who considers themselves you<br>know a social scientist<br>is kind of amazing the thing is i<br>couldn't use it for research purposes<br>obviously because i didn't have the kids<br>through and i was looking after my<br>daughter<br>but it was really interesting to see you<br>know in between looking after her and<br>doing the things with her just seeing<br>that the way that different parents of<br>these babies were interacting with these<br>medical<br>experts be they nurses<br>neonatologists or other doctors around<br>the place<br>it was especially interesting because at<br>the time that this happened i was<br>finishing off my phd my office was 10<br>minutes from the hospital it was like<br>somehow that worked out really well it<br>was a very strange time but i was<br>bouncing between doing shifts in the<br>hospital with her and trying to finish<br>this thesis off before the deadline so i<br>was very much immersed in this idea of<br>you know what does it actually mean to<br>develop expertise and how do we get it<br>and in those interactions between<br>parents and doctors in the hospital<br>um i started to see some very<br>interesting things<br>some of them seemed to go very<br>positively and they were very smooth and<br>easy and everyone was kind of happy and<br>some of them went horribly wrong<br>and the more i started to watch this<br>kind of unfold<br>the more i started to think that i mean<br>there's a lot of things going on there<br>people are very emotional because it's<br>their children and the stakes can be<br>really really high<br>but one of the things i started to<br>realize<br>is that a lot of the time the central<br>issue was a difference in<br>basic assumptions about what it means to<br>be an expert<br>that to me seemed to be a major issue in<br>these situations and these conflicts<br>often between parents and medical<br>experts<br>so by the way daughters she's fine now<br>that was here on her birthday earlier<br>this year so she's doing really really<br>great but that experience really led me<br>to start thinking seriously about this<br>question here<br>how can we actually explain and<br>understand<br>these unproductive interactions both<br>that people have with experts if they're<br>seeking them out but also in terms of<br>experts you know maybe not conducting<br>themselves in especially helpful ways so<br>i was really thinking about this<br>question following that experience my<br>daughter in the hospital i started<br>talking to my friend lauren about this<br>we started our phd at the same time and<br>finished more or less at the same time<br>and<br>i started talking to her about this<br>because her thesis was all about these<br>things called lay theories<br>lay theories um has anyone heard this<br>term before<br>no so it's not something that's super<br>you know<br>commonly used but the basic idea is<br>actually really really simple<br>they're basically just<br>you know when psychologists talk about<br>lay theories or sometimes they call them<br>implicit theories they're these<br>subjective assumptions that all of us<br>have about what the world is and how it<br>works<br>right and those lay theories we begin<br>developing from the time we're babies<br>you know if i cry i get fed or someone<br>attends to me we develop these lay<br>theories from the moment we're born<br>basically and continue to develop and<br>refine them throughout our lives and we<br>develop them both about the physical<br>world you know if i go out in the rain<br>without a jacket then my late theory<br>indicates i'm going to get wet i might<br>get sick it might be kind of miserable<br>but also importantly<br>about the social world and about<br>ourselves<br>so lauren's thesis was all on this<br>kind of thing<br>and her specific focus was actually on<br>something you're probably very familiar<br>with maybe too familiar with as<br>educators<br>but this idea of fix and growth mindsets<br>so carol dweck has done a lot of<br>research on that so she calls that she<br>called the stuff mindsets to really<br>make it you know<br>uh<br>basically easier to translate it sounds<br>mindset sounds a lot more catchy than<br>implicit theory right<br>so it's clever marketing on her behalf<br>but all of the research she's actually<br>done is under the umbrella of implicit<br>theories of intelligence and abilities<br>so you already know<br>uh probably quite a bit about one form<br>of these lay theories right so while her<br>focus<br>was on people's assumptions about how do<br>you develop intelligence or skill<br>between myself and lauren we really<br>started to wonder well how could we ask<br>similar questions about people's<br>assumptions about expertise you know<br>what does it even mean<br>to be an expert and how you kind of<br>get that and with what consequences<br>so we decided to collaborate on some<br>research and this was really our big<br>question that we've been working on for<br>the last little while<br>and looking at what kinds of lay<br>theories of expertise are out there in<br>people's minds<br>you know so we know with the delay<br>theories or the mindset stuff there's<br>sort of the fixed and growth of the two<br>main dominant types that people vary on<br>we wanted to see what's out there in<br>terms of expertise<br>so then another funny thing kind of<br>happened in this process<br>um<br>we wrote a really short sort of paper<br>for a conference about this early last<br>year in january 2020<br>and in the introduction to that i was<br>following quite closely at the time<br>there was a measles epidemic in samoa<br>which was big news some of you might<br>remember it you know and it was a lot of<br>cases and kids were dying and stuff and<br>it was serious<br>and we use that as sort of you know to<br>highlight the consequences of people not<br>engaging or experts not engaging with<br>people appropriately in terms of things<br>like vaccination<br>right little did we know<br>that a month later<br>this covert thing would come along and<br>happen and all of a sudden<br>all of these issues<br>are suddenly magnified a hundred<br>thousand times over<br>um<br>which has obviously been devastating in<br>terms of deaths and other social<br>consequences<br>but for us as researchers we were like<br>wow you know<br>here's a chance to really study the very<br>thing we're interested in in a lot of<br>detail with a lot of different data<br>sources that we can draw<br>um so there's a sort of a running joke i<br>think in academia at the moment that<br>everyone has this sort of covert moment<br>you know where they find a way to write<br>a paper or do a study on something that<br>has covert plus whatever their research<br>interest is so<br>with us though to be fair you know we<br>were sort of already thinking about this<br>and covert became a vehicle we could use<br>to study it a lot more closely and<br>specifically<br>so to do this<br>and look at these laters of expertise a<br>bit more closely we basically use a<br>combination of questionnaires not the<br>the old-fashioned handwritten type but<br>the online type and also looking at what<br>people were tweeting about expertise on<br>social media<br>um particularly in the early stages of<br>covert between april and may 2020 so<br>there's a huge amount of activity on<br>there about that stuff at the time i'll<br>share some of that with you in a second<br>um<br>basically we did a very simple<br>open-ended question here to start off<br>with we asked a bunch of people<br>you know what do you think expertise<br>means how do you kind of size it up we<br>got the tweets off twitter and these two<br>alone when we started to look at this<br>data we were able to<br>just start developing some initial<br>categories these different types of<br>understandings of expertise<br>and then we had this like second phase<br>where we got a little bit more creative<br>um and we got people to as big these big<br>representative samples in the usa<br>to generate<br>lists of words they associate with<br>expertise we took the most common words<br>and we got another big group to sort<br>these words into categories and then we<br>looked across all the participants to<br>see what categories were common and<br>whether those sort of aligned with our<br>initial thoughts from that first phase<br>right and whether we were sort of what<br>they call triangulation i suppose<br>converging<br>on<br>the right or a valid<br>uh structure of categories of late use<br>of expertise<br>this service was really helpful for us<br>prolific it's basically an online<br>service that helps you recruit research<br>participants that's why a lot of our<br>research participants are from the us<br>because most of the people who sign up<br>to the services from there they get paid<br>to do studies and you specify the<br>research how much they get paid and what<br>you want them to do so it's really<br>revolutionized sort of survey research<br>and stuff but it was very helpful<br>i thought the easiest way to show you<br>what we actually found<br>is to show you how you know i talked<br>about getting participants people to<br>generate those lists of words associated<br>with expertise<br>what that allows us to do in combination<br>with the word sort is to quantitatively<br>we use this technique called cluster<br>analysis<br>that basically allows us to see which<br>words tend to go in the same places<br>across all of the participants right so<br>which words basically orbit the same<br>basic idea or assumption about expertise<br>and these were our four categories that<br>our cluster analysis after a few<br>iterations gave us<br>and you could probably intuitively see<br>right that there are sort of<br>they make sense to a degree right the<br>last one that blue one is a little bit<br>confusing but i mean this first one you<br>can see all of this here is basically<br>suggesting that expertise is about<br>knowing a whole lot right that's the key<br>i the key thing so we kind of call this<br>the epistemic<br>lay theory of expertise the second one<br>the purple one on the other hand<br>is quite different it's not so much<br>about knowing a lot it's about actually<br>getting stuff done right making things<br>happen and solving problems so we call<br>that the practical lay theory this third<br>one<br>really emphasizes i mean it still<br>maintains the knowledge or the skill<br>aspect but it's really emphasizing this<br>idea of having gone through some sort of<br>special process via doing research or<br>completing a degree or study to get that<br>right so it's not like you've just gone<br>out into your back shed or googled a<br>whole lot of stuff on uh wikipedia or<br>youtube right there's some sort of<br>systematic special process you've gone<br>through so we call that developmental<br>lay theory this last one is it might<br>seem a little bit confusing i think it<br>will become clearer to you when i show<br>you some of the tweets about this um<br>but in our view all of this is really<br>getting at the status aspect of<br>expertise it's something about your<br>position and society<br>relative to other people so that one i<br>feel is a little bit more<br>blurry than the others but i think it<br>will make sense once i show you some of<br>the stuff so i thought what would be<br>cool to show you next recognizing we<br>don't have a whole heap of time uh just<br>some of the like questionnaire responses<br>and tweets that informed in their<br>initial phase<br>these categories that we sort of arrived<br>at because some of them are quite<br>interesting um<br>the this one's really obvious i don't<br>even need to spend much time on i just<br>sort of show you as the baseline right<br>this was this was very common<br>understandably a lot of people<br>think about expertise as really knowing<br>a whole lot right so you know a whole<br>lot about something you understand the<br>grand ideas and things fine<br>um<br>on the other hand though<br>we saw this really interesting variant<br>of this lay theory<br>um that was a lot more sort of<br>pessimistic and cynical and saying so an<br>expert is someone who knows a lot but<br>their knowledge is so narrow<br>that it's basically<br>useless<br>which as an academic reading that uh<br>really<br>you know<br>that hit me quite hard reading that one<br>seeing that in the twitter data that we<br>were looking at<br>but you know it's a view that's out<br>there and that's what we're trying to<br>canvas all these different views<br>a really interesting one we saw<br>that is very rare but it's definitely a<br>thing like it's it's a way that people<br>think about it um is this idea that<br>expertise yes it's about knowing a lot<br>but it's also<br>about realizing your limitations you<br>know so knowing what you don't know<br>basically that whole you know idea of<br>socrates i'm the wisest because i<br>realize that i don't know everything<br>that kind of thing<br>so we saw that came through in a little<br>bit of the data as well and i think<br>of all the ones i'm covering with you<br>today<br>i feel like this is perhaps one of the<br>most consequential and you see it in<br>this tweet right in terms of<br>what i talked about those interactions<br>people have we're having in the hospital<br>with<br>doctors and things that sort of level of<br>forgiveness and realizing that experts<br>don't always get it right but they<br>probably get it better you know more<br>they're probably more likely to be<br>accurate than anyone else that level of<br>realism and sort of wisdom i think is<br>super important in making or breaking<br>those expert interactions so really<br>interesting one that we saw there a sort<br>of variant of the episemic the<br>developmental one again pretty<br>straightforward i think<br>we didn't see too many interesting<br>variants with this one in terms of the<br>twitter data and stuff<br>um<br>just people emphasizing your process and<br>going through special sort of avenues to<br>develop your knowledgeable skills<br>the practical one again<br>is one that i think is pretty<br>consequential<br>because on the one hand i think all of<br>us have this to a degree right we do<br>expect experts<br>to solve problems to a degree if they<br>did it we probably wouldn't pay them<br>much attention<br>but at the extreme<br>and we kind of saw this on odds<br>especially in the twitter data something<br>about people on twitter um<br>when people endorse this particular lane<br>theory like they really really believe<br>in it to a high level they're basically<br>just consistently disappointed<br>because<br>experts always get stuff wrong you know<br>there's always a level of error involved<br>in doing things like modeling covert<br>outcomes or predicting what's going to<br>happen with vaccination or whatever<br>so the downside of this practical lay<br>theory at the extreme is we think that<br>it gives people<br>unrealistically high expectations of<br>experts<br>sets them up to be disappointed and<br>breeds mistrust and<br>a lack of satisfaction so i think this<br>is another one that could be<br>consequential<br>this one too was kind of scary<br>because<br>there were a lot of people in the<br>twitter data<br>like a really sizable amount<br>that basically just saw expertise as a<br>status<br>and that's it like<br>a social status purely a status thing<br>devoid of any functional substance like<br>knowledge skills whatever it doesn't<br>really enter into the picture expertise<br>is really just about your position in<br>society that you have these fancy<br>degrees or affiliations<br>and i think<br>you're seeing that born out quite<br>clearly in a lot of the conspiracy<br>theory things and different movements<br>that we've seen over the last few months<br>where that<br>that mistrust that this kind of lay<br>theory breathe starts to become really<br>consequential in terms of some of the<br>social outcomes<br>we don't have any hard data on that yet<br>but i think this particular lathier of<br>expertise this assumption that expertise<br>is really just a status and and often<br>people use that state as a<br>self-interested ends which you know that<br>does happen to a degree that's accurate<br>but endorsing this in the extreme i<br>think is potentially quite problematic<br>so that's sort of where we've um<br>got to with things all of that took a<br>little while to do with navigating the<br>different ethics processes and<br>collecting data and things but now and i<br>thought this might be a nice sort of<br>segue into the i think we've got about<br>10 minutes or so for questions or<br>whatever<br>um a nice segue into that part what<br>we're working on is really starting to<br>think about<br>and test i've alluded to some of this<br>and what i just said<br>what does all of this mean these<br>differences and assumptions about<br>expertise for the quality<br>of interactions with experts you know do<br>they do those interactions go well do<br>they go badly<br>do people learn a lot do they not learn<br>a lot<br>as well as looking at the different<br>combinations of these things you know<br>because we the norm was that people<br>didn't just have one of these views on<br>expertise they had a mixture of them but<br>they might endorse<br>one or more of them to another stronger<br>degree so looking at those different<br>configurations or mixtures is also<br>something we're looking at<br>we're designing an experiment at the<br>moment to do we haven't exactly<br>identified the the group but some sort<br>of experiment where we can start to<br>tease these things out a little bit more<br>but i'd be really interested to hear<br>from all of you<br>you know if anything i've said today<br>resonates with something you see in your<br>own lives personally or professionally<br>um<br>yeah be really keen to to hear some of<br>those because that's often how<br>future research ideas are sort of<br>inspired and where they come from<br>i don't want to plug the university too<br>hard either but if anyone wants to do a<br>master's or a phd or something and this<br>stuff is interesting to you then there's<br>there's always<br>that opportunity as well<br>i've opened the chat that is there any<br>attendees online can also hear the<br>questions as well so um depending on<br>your<br>skills<br>if<br>i think that yeah it's a really good<br>question um<br>i think that practical one<br>was very salient for people like very<br>front of mind<br>but i think i totally understand that<br>because it's<br>your child is there they might have an<br>issue or something<br>the the biggest thing like i think your<br>goal really affects it there you know in<br>that context you want them to be okay so<br>you want the expert to come in and just<br>tell you here's how we're going to fix<br>it it's all going to be good i'm going<br>to make it happen<br>off but experts that's this kind of the<br>thing we've found that that's the the<br>cruel paradox in a way is that the more<br>you actually develop a lot of knowledge<br>in an area the more you actually realize<br>how little you know so the more likely<br>you are to actually hedge things and<br>qualify because you you don't want to<br>you know come off as overconfident so i<br>think in that setting<br>the major problem was that a lot of<br>people were very high on this practical<br>lay theory and it was very front of mind<br>for them but a lot of the doctors and<br>the nurses who came in very much had<br>that sort of socratic thing going on<br>that i mentioned and being seeing<br>expertise a cool part of this is knowing<br>what my limitations are and<br>communicating that but because of the<br>misalignment<br>you had these these conflicts and these<br>issues and<br>a lot of you know disappointment and<br>frustration i i want to look at that<br>actually as a researcher<br>one of my hopes is to go back into<br>actually that setting and try and see<br>these things and actually put some hard<br>data around these things because i think<br>that particular setting could be a<br>really interesting<br>you know real world application of some<br>similar um that social media itself<br>is reaching the balance of these<br>underlying assumptions of people it<br>seems to me truly that sort of<br>constructivists<br>will actually get more related<br>i think i'm sorry i just missed the<br>i think for sure one of the things we<br>point out in the<br>limitations of the twitter study well<br>it's not really a limitation but it<br>attracts a certain type of person<br>so<br>what was interesting to us i don't have<br>the graphs here but when we looked at<br>the questionnaire data which was from<br>you know i'd say a different sort of<br>subset of the population the epistemic<br>the practical ones were very high the<br>the one that was we most commonly saw<br>amongst the twitter group was the<br>constructivist one and that very<br>cynical<br>expertise is just a status thing<br>um we saw that as the most common so<br>there's definitely these differences<br>between subgroups and i think<br>that the the social media platforms<br>themselves do play a role in that right<br>because it's all about i mean on twitter<br>you only have what is it like 280<br>characters now so it's whatever is the<br>most sort of bold and confident sounding<br>claim tends to get retweeted and<br>amplified and amplified and the guy<br>who's on twitter going well you know<br>it's sort of like that but it's also<br>kind of like this and maybe i don't know<br>no one's going to retweet that right so<br>that is kind of the central problem in a<br>way because that ladder view<br>is probably actually<br>depending on what you have but probably<br>more actually reflective of real<br>i don't think we've got any questions<br>coming through yet on the chat but if<br>please hi um we're just passing along<br>here<br>um<br>i'm just wondering if you come up with<br>any idea we've had a big deal i mean i<br>guess people might i need to find<br>something um<br>um<br>i always hate it when researchers say<br>this but the good news is<br>that that when you look at that research<br>on other forms of implicit theories like<br>i mean this is why she sort of became so<br>famous carol directs stuff on<br>intelligence and ability<br>the the big thing for her wasn't that<br>there's these two implicit theories but<br>that you can actually change them<br>through interventions like education or<br>workshops or coaching so our<br>hope<br>is that maybe the same principle applies<br>to late theories of expertise and that<br>if you did not design an intervention in<br>a way<br>that you can actually manipulate and<br>change a person's mindset about<br>expertise<br>it might actually result in better<br>outcomes so there is a precedent there<br>in terms of research on other forms of<br>lay theories that suggest if with the<br>right approach and the right effort you<br>can change these things<br>the downside is<br>we don't know i mean we this is why we<br>sort of want to do that experiment that<br>i talked about to try this stuff out<br>because<br>the lathe use of expertise might not be<br>as malleable you know it might not be as<br>easy to change those as it is<br>potentially some of the other things but<br>don't know at the moment but i agree if<br>that is something that we could find and<br>if we could find a good intervention and<br>intervention in particular for i think<br>adjusting that constructivist one and<br>the practical one bringing it back down<br>to a more reasonable level then<br>yeah hopefully that results in some<br>better outcomes in terms of things like<br>bring<br>different attitudes to those and<br>maybe<br>um the way that you approach a<br>conversation<br>with a parent might depend on like<br>you'll read their kind of attitude<br>and i'm just wondering how it feeds into<br>this and maybe<br>thinking about<br>rather than<br>looking to<br>adjust people's layer theories like is<br>there um some work that could be done<br>around giving experts the skills to<br>um<br>these conversations there's also<br>different ways depending on that's such<br>a good idea<br>yeah<br>that is a really cool idea right because<br>it's it's not just that i mean the ideal<br>thing is that if you could have<br>an expert like a teacher or a doctor or<br>whatever<br>to have the skill to be able to sort of<br>shape it in real time right with the<br>person they're interacting with eg the<br>grumpy parent or whatever at the<br>interview<br>yeah i think that's an it's an awesome<br>idea um<br>i think the first step would be<br>to what extent are these things<br>changeable and if they are then the next<br>step is how can we<br>train and equip people in these<br>important positions<br>with the skills to actually do that you<br>know because it is it's hard you know<br>like if you've ever talked to anyone<br>who<br>endorses maybe some of these more<br>outlier things like the constructivist<br>one really strongly it's a really hard<br>thing to do and and often none of us<br>really knows how where to start with<br>that about how to sort of work their<br>mind around to a<br>different perspective but i think it's<br>awesome view i'd love to look into that<br>in the in the future<br>um<br>management systems that teachers might<br>go through it's an expectation that<br>teachers have certain skills and<br>capabilities expertise<br>and thank you<br>to the latest my research on<br>mpfs really interesting<br>i think it's really great when the<br>thank you all so much for that i really<br>now whoever has the blue box i'll just<br>now you can hopefully see we've got our<br>next speaker um this i'll just get<br>are those slides kind of working and<br>they have come up we can see those<br>that's all looking good let me introduce<br>a second speaker joining us over at zoom<br>it's really great to have you dominic<br>dominic stevens is deputy secretary<br>chief economic advisor and this sounds<br>very important responsible for ensuring<br>the treasury's policy advice on lifting<br>new zealand's living standards supported<br>and strengthened by science economic<br>theory and evidence dominic's actually<br>on secondment from his to treasury from<br>westback where he's been chief economist<br>for the last decade providing leading a<br>team providing forecasting research on<br>new zealand's economy it has a number of<br>roles including and membership of the<br>westpac sustainability steering<br>committee and dominate we've got a<br>speaker talking about sustainability<br>after the break so it's a very good<br>topic there as well dominic's actually<br>going to talk to us today about new<br>zealand's housing market and the<br>importance of interest rates and urban<br>land supply um dominic do you want to<br>just say hello so we can check the uh<br>sound levels here and online<br>can i just ask can you see me<br>we can't see you as well yes brilliant<br>oh that's fantastic and you can see the<br>slides so let's just check that the<br>slides<br>transitions work<br>all good<br>they do work excellent<br>okay<br>so i'm just going to check and room if<br>the signs okay there<br>yeah i can see some nods from the back<br>all right so i'm going to go and sit<br>down again we'll be monitoring the chat<br>so if you do have questions as we go<br>through do pop them in there don't make<br>don't worry about monitoring that we'll<br>let you know when the questions uh when<br>the questions uh come through<br>over to you dominic<br>thanks very much for uh introducing me<br>and welcoming me to to the stage today<br>um i can't actually see you<br>um but i'll do my best and there's<br>actually a little bit of an echo coming<br>through to me<br>um<br>perhaps that might be something<br>is there anything we can do about that<br>just sort of at this and i think we've<br>left<br>okay thanks very much um this is these<br>are days of covert and this is how we do<br>things we we we make do and we we do the<br>best that we possibly can um i'm<br>actually although i'm deputy secretary<br>at the treasury uh which is wellington<br>based i'm i live in auckland so i was<br>commuting to wellington sort of for<br>three days a week<br>until august and since that time i've<br>been stuck in auckland um working from<br>home<br>uh in a wellington job which has been<br>it's actually worked really well so<br>okay so what i'm here to talk about<br>today for i've got 45 minutes in total<br>including questions is<br>i'd like to uh convey<br>the way that we are thinking about<br>housing or house prices in new zealand<br>is changing<br>so i think there's been there are common<br>ideas about how housing markets work<br>that i think have been severely<br>challenged by the data over the past<br>year but in my view have been severely<br>challenged actually over 20 years<br>and<br>new thoughts about how housing markets<br>work<br>are sort of coming to the fore within<br>government and you'll notice there has<br>been some change in the government's<br>say government policy statement on<br>housing and urban development is really<br>focusing more and more on<br>the availability of land for development<br>rather than construction of dwellings on<br>top of<br>land okay so<br>as i say i'll try and sort of i gave<br>this presentation the other day and it<br>took 55 minutes so i'm going to try and<br>get through it as quick as possible so<br>we can have some um some time for<br>discussion<br>what i'm going to start by doing is<br>is um challenging<br>three<br>i think quite embedded ways of thinking<br>about the housing market in new zealand<br>and i think these these ways of thinking<br>about the housing market do reflect<br>they actually reflect sort of<br>well-established theories that were<br>developed in the 1960s in the united<br>states and maybe once upon a time they<br>applied but as i say i think the last 20<br>years of experience in new zealand has<br>really challenged three common ideas<br>about housing in new zealand<br>um the first i have to say you know when<br>i talk to people i think most people<br>have an idea that house prices in new<br>zealand are really expensive because<br>well they observe that we do in fact<br>have a housing shortage so we know that<br>people more people are squeezing into<br>fewer houses in new zealand we know that<br>there's homelessness and i think most<br>people connect that to the really high<br>house prices that are out there and kind<br>of think well<br>the mismatch between the number of<br>people in the country and the number of<br>houses we've got is what's caused house<br>prices to go up so often theories of<br>what's driven house prices<br>sort of hark back to well there's been a<br>lot of immigration recently and that's<br>what's driving prices up or<br>there's not enough responsiveness in the<br>construction sector so the shortage of<br>construction is what has has driven<br>prices up<br>as i say this idea has been<br>severely challenged over the past year<br>and a half so it's actually it's a year<br>and three quarters now since april 2020<br>net migration to new zealand has been<br>essentially zero<br>since april 2020 so more than 18 months<br>of basic a very very low population<br>growth<br>the other thing that's happening is that<br>the blue line in this chart the number<br>of dwellings being built each quarter is<br>absolutely booming and is at its highest<br>in over 40 years it's much higher more<br>than double uh what it was 10 years ago<br>so construction is booming<br>population growth is very low the idea<br>of many kiwis returning from overseas is<br>actually a myth<br>population growth has been very very low<br>yet house prices have risen at 30<br>percent per annum and i think that's a<br>very severe challenge to the idea that<br>physical supply and demand<br>drives of dwellings drives prices<br>um you might sort of say okay well yeah<br>but covert is kind of an exception and<br>things are a little bit different so<br>that's fair enough but i think the<br>challenge to this idea is much deeper<br>than just the past 18 months actually if<br>we go back over the past 20 years<br>and we look at what's happened to prices<br>and rents relative to inflation<br>over 20 years<br>we have to sort of scratch our heads at<br>this point and say well<br>if it's all about supply and demand so<br>people you know<br>getting shelter over your head is the<br>problem of people paying up for houses<br>because they're short well why haven't<br>rents risen<br>because rents relative to inflation have<br>actually risen 26<br>over 20 years which is pretty much in<br>line with what's happened to income<br>growth over that period<br>whereas house prices have risen last i<br>looked it was 336 percent but you know<br>that was a month or so ago it's probably<br>350 percent now you know<br>the the increase in house prices is an<br>order of magnitude different<br>to the lift and rents<br>and again if it's if it's really about<br>just a physical shortage of shelter<br>surely some of the people squeezed out<br>of purchasing houses would have gone<br>into the rental market so why haven't<br>rents risen more<br>and sometimes people say well it's<br>because you know if they're very fixed<br>on an immigration link they sort of say<br>well the incoming people want to buy<br>they don't want to you know different<br>markets<br>but that just doesn't hold water at all<br>the um we then have to ask why are<br>landlords paying such a massively higher<br>price relative to the stream of rents<br>they're earning than they were 20 years<br>ago<br>so this blowout and the price to rent<br>ratio is actually the biggest thing that<br>needs explaining in the new zealand<br>housing market<br>and just in case you think that this is<br>a sort of a theoretical idea that<br>if we really were short of houses both<br>rents and prices would have risen<br>we can have a look at what happened to<br>christchurch after the earthquakes which<br>is a great example<br>or a very unfortunate example<br>of what happens when physical supply and<br>demand of dwellings changes really<br>rapidly<br>so in christchurch i've got two charts<br>here<br>christchurch house prices relative to<br>the national average on the left<br>rents relative to the national average<br>on the right and actually as you'd<br>expect what happened you know we wiped<br>out 10 000 houses overnight<br>and rent went through the roof to a<br>greater extent than prices these are<br>actually graphed on the same axes rents<br>went through the roof to a greater<br>extent than prices<br>over time we built a load of houses in<br>christchurch both rents and prices<br>moderated relative to the national<br>average<br>and more recently what you've seen is<br>christchurch behaving pretty much the<br>same as the rest of the country with<br>prices exploding while rents are kind of<br>more or less stable<br>so we really do know<br>that when you're shorter houses and when<br>you build more<br>rents and prices both respond together<br>the final challenge to this idea of<br>physical supply and demand is the driver<br>as well<br>unless different places in new zealand<br>were perfect substitutes for one another<br>you you'd surely think that the places<br>with the most population growth<br>house price inflation<br>but that's not true<br>this scatter plot shows all of the<br>territorial authorities in new zealand<br>it plots them by population growth on<br>the horizontal axis and house price<br>growth on the vertical there is no<br>correspondence at all between population<br>growth and house price growth and in<br>fact there are four territorial<br>authorities where population has shrunk<br>over 20 years and they've had absolutely<br>massive house price booms<br>okay so hopefully i've at least<br>challenged um the first assertion people<br>often make<br>the second would be<br>construction costs so people often say<br>well<br>in it's kind of related to the um<br>to the responsiveness of the<br>construction industry people say well<br>well it's really hard to get<br>construction done in new zealand you've<br>got to pay all this money to the council<br>you've got you know difficulty getting<br>supplies in you builders charge an arm<br>and a leg and they're really inefficient<br>and construction costs going up are<br>what's driven house prices up and if we<br>if we just got construction costs down<br>we'd fix the housing crisis<br>well<br>that's challenged by the facts to some<br>extent as well i do think there's<br>something in this but it's it's not it's<br>not really a big part of the whole thing<br>this chart shows what's happened to<br>inflation over 20 years construction<br>costs and house prices the construction<br>cost bit is the cpi um new dwellings<br>index it measures the cost of building<br>everything and once you've got the pipes<br>into the section it's the cost of<br>putting the the box on top of that<br>including your architects and your<br>development um sort of levies and and<br>building consent and all the rest of it<br>and it is true that in inflation<br>adjusted terms construction costs have<br>doubled in new zealand over 20 years so<br>that's that's serious<br>but house prices have done much more<br>than that implying that the vast<br>majority<br>of the lift in prices<br>has been in the land<br>and anybody who's owned a house over the<br>past 20 years will know that each three<br>years you get a<br>you get a bit of you know good piece of<br>paper telling you what your house is is<br>valued at uh and it gives you a<br>valuation for the capital in the land<br>and it's always the land that goes up so<br>land prices<br>really are what has risen<br>to some extent the price of putting a a<br>dwelling on the land has risen but it's<br>it's a small part of the puzzle and i<br>think that really challenges the idea<br>that construction costs are the biggest<br>driver<br>okay so that's two two ideas that i'm<br>sort of<br>that i think are actually puzzles rather<br>than you know<br>definitely set ideas now<br>if you're not already sitting can i<br>please make sure you are sitting for the<br>next one because i'm really going to<br>push the boat out here and and<br>challenge a very sacrosanct idea<br>what i'm going to say is<br>it's not actually completely<br>straightforward to say housing is<br>unaffordable<br>in new zealand<br>and i know that if this was a a physical<br>presentation i would be chased off the<br>stage at this point so i'm lucky i'm i'm<br>not physically there<br>but but just bear with me for a second<br>while i work through this<br>at some level you must know this is true<br>by the way because<br>10 000 houses a month are trading<br>hands<br>at the prices we experience today<br>somebody can afford them<br>at these prices<br>so let's just trace through what's going<br>on and this this is the uh department of<br>housing and urban development's new<br>brand new housing affordability indices<br>these have just gone up on their website<br>and they're um there's a really fancy<br>tool in there where you can look at<br>what's happened to various ideas of<br>housing affordability across places in<br>new zealand these are the national<br>averages<br>now there's three different concepts of<br>affordability in there and the first is<br>the rent affordability index<br>you can see over 20 years so what it is<br>is the rent price index measured by<br>stats new zealand versus median incomes<br>in new zealand<br>and you can see over 20 years the change<br>in the rent affordability and the change<br>in the rent price index has been similar<br>to the change in median incomes so rent<br>affordability sort of hasn't gone<br>anywhere on average and again that<br>chimes with the idea that it's not<br>really rents that have risen over 20<br>years<br>now i do know that<br>averages disguise a lot so there are<br>times and places where rents have gone<br>up and i already mentioned christchurch<br>i know that wellington right now is a<br>place where rents have risen quite<br>rapidly over about the past four or five<br>years um we're doing a deep dive into<br>hamilton we know that and rotorua those<br>are other places where<br>rents have risen quite rapidly relative<br>to incomes and it's<br>a big lift and rents is often a worse<br>societal outcome because often often<br>more vulnerable people are renting<br>um and there's<br>there's no sort of capital gain for<br>renters to to sort of<br>ease the pain of of lack of<br>affordability where it occurs<br>um the other thing of course is<br>actually rents for pretty much across<br>the board have risen about the same<br>amount so small medium and big houses<br>flash houses apartments they've all<br>risen about the same percentage but<br>incomes have not so the lowest incomes<br>have not kept pace with the median<br>and that means there is a rent<br>affordability issue among the lowest<br>income new zealanders so i'm not<br>diminishing any of those<br>social issues but but when we diagnose<br>the housing market<br>overall and we i'm sort of stepping back<br>and looking macro here<br>rent affordability<br>is not the place that we are looking and<br>in fact on average rents have risen at<br>about the same speed as incomes over 20<br>years<br>second concept is and by the way on<br>these charts up means more affordable<br>down means less<br>mortgage affordability is the next<br>concept and what that measures is the<br>is the weekly cost of servicing<br>a two-year fixed rate mortgage<br>at<br>a normal house price<br>compared to the change in median incomes<br>so it measures it's basically just<br>saying it is in fact<br>cheaper<br>to service the massive mortgages people<br>have today<br>than it was to service them when house<br>prices were half what they are today but<br>but mortgage rates were more than double<br>what they are<br>the mortgage affordability index is far<br>higher than it was in 2001 and far far<br>higher than 2007 um and even it's it's<br>it's you know mortgage affordability is<br>better than it was even just a few years<br>ago<br>rapidly changing by the way as mortgage<br>rates rise but still um<br>this is this is kind of a really key<br>point<br>people who are able to muster a deposit<br>the people who already have the means<br>to get on that housing ladder<br>are actually finding housing very<br>and that's a that's a um<br>a really interesting idea and it i think<br>it's worth pointing out because it<br>focuses us<br>on the real problem<br>which is deposit affordability so the<br>deposit affordability index measures<br>the<br>a 20 of fixed deposit level on a house<br>how has that changed relative to median<br>incomes and it has plunged<br>so it is much harder twice as hard now<br>to muster a deposit on a median income<br>than it was 20 years ago<br>so if we narrow in on what the actual<br>social issue is there's there's<br>distributional issues and rents<br>but the the big thing is the people who<br>it's much harder to muster a deposit<br>severe problem for young people so locks<br>them into renting um and pro a problem<br>for people who<br>perhaps are on lower than median incomes<br>and can't muster the<br>the lifting hurdle that is required to<br>to to to muster a a deposit<br>there's actually<br>this is a good framework for thinking<br>about it because in a way if you think<br>about it the<br>the rampant affordability<br>of borrowing money today to buy a house<br>is precisely what's driven prices up<br>and has caused the problem with deposit<br>affordability<br>so one group of new zealanders is doing<br>very well out of this obviously and one<br>group of new zealanders is really<br>struggling and that's that's really the<br>problem<br>probably the other<br>thought that occurs when you look at<br>this is<br>the next time somebody says um<br>why are people paying nine times income<br>for houses today when<br>we used to only pay three times income<br>to buy a house<br>the answer is they're not because really<br>the<br>when you purchase a house<br>you don't pay away eight hundred<br>thousand dollars today whereas you used<br>to pay away four hundred thousand you<br>you purchase an eight hundred thousand<br>dollar asset which you can later sell<br>or downgrade in your old age and use the<br>capital<br>so you're not paying away eight hundred<br>thousand dollars what you're doing is<br>tying up eight hundred thousand dollars<br>and as the mortgage affordability index<br>shows actually the cost the weekly cost<br>of tying up a bunch of money or<br>borrowing<br>is less than it was 20 years ago people<br>are not paying<br>a huge<br>hugely high proportion of their income<br>to borrow money to buy houses<br>what's what is happening is it's really<br>hard to muster a deposit and that has<br>created a<br>it's redistributed wealth in<br>uncomfortable ways uh it's prevented<br>people from getting into the market and<br>it's as i say deposit affordability is<br>the actual issue<br>okay so um so hopefully i've i've raised<br>a few thoughts that are less than than<br>common and by the way i forgot my little<br>disclaimer at the start which is that<br>the views expressed here are my own<br>um i am drawing on experience from<br>westpac and treasury and i'm the chair<br>of a housing technical working group<br>which<br>is a cooperation between treasury<br>reserve bank and<br>and the department of housing and urban<br>development but these are these are my<br>views and i will try to sort of um<br>explain which parts are my observations<br>and which parts are sort of more<br>consensus<br>okay so um<br>as i say it's not so much about physical<br>supply and demand of dwellings it's not<br>so much about construction costs and and<br>actually some people are finding this<br>housing market really affordable while<br>i'm going to propose a um that<br>actually interest rates<br>are the biggest driver<br>of house prices in new zealand<br>so<br>this chart shows you that over time<br>mortgage the ups and downs of mortgage<br>rates in new zealand are closely<br>correlated to the ups and downs of house<br>price inflation in new zealand i've<br>highlighted the ups but the downs also<br>kind of match up<br>i have in fact this is a simple way of<br>showing it but i have in fact done<br>loads of statistical analysis on this<br>and anybody who who researches this at a<br>macro level cannot get away from the<br>link between interest rates and house<br>prices that really shows up in<br>regressions<br>and i just want to say right at the<br>start this is not a beat up of the<br>reserve bank or a proposal that we<br>should change the way the reserve bank<br>operates because as adrianov said a week<br>or two ago<br>new zealand's a price taker on interest<br>rates we you know the big thing that's<br>happened over the last 20 years is a<br>global drop in interest rates and we<br>could no longer no more have stopped<br>that<br>arriving on new zealand shores then we<br>could have stopped um then king canute<br>could have<br>stopped the tide you know<br>globally there's been a big drop in<br>interest rates and new zealand had to<br>take that<br>um<br>but what i'm going to propose is that<br>a big decline in global interest rates<br>over the course of 20 years<br>in the context of constrained urban land<br>supply is what has driven<br>prices up in new zealand<br>okay so why would interest rates affect<br>house prices<br>and i am going to do a little bit of um<br>get into a little bit of sort of basic<br>economics here and a few little<br>equations and things<br>um<br>basically the rental yield on a house<br>should bear some kind of a relationship<br>to the interest rate because after all<br>if you could borrow money at two percent<br>and then buy a house rented out at 10<br>percent of what it's worth each year<br>well<br>there'd be a load of demand to buy<br>houses house prices would go up and the<br>rental yield would change<br>so rental yields need to bear some kind<br>of relationship to the interest rate<br>and we can flip that around<br>and just say well the price<br>is related to<br>the rent divided by the interest rate<br>this is standard asset pricing theory<br>this is how companies are valued this is<br>how<br>shares are valued by equity market<br>analysts this is how commercial property<br>operators work basically what we're<br>saying is that the price of an asset is<br>related to the discount rate which is<br>effectively the same as the interest<br>rate so interest rates change price to<br>rent needs to change or you could say<br>well<br>prices adjust<br>and in the case of housing markets<br>it's actually not just rents that matter<br>you've got to think about capital gains<br>you've got to think about taxes you've<br>got to maintain the house you've got to<br>think about<br>people willing to pay for a house not<br>just because of its financial<br>worth they but they might have fallen in<br>love with it and think it's a cute house<br>and want to buy it and all the rest of<br>it<br>so there's a<br>thing called a perturber equation which<br>links prices and rents and basically<br>says that the price of a house<br>should equal the net present value of<br>the future flow<br>of rents capital gains less<br>maintenance costs<br>and the net as we know net present<br>values are closely related to interest<br>rates or discount rates which appear on<br>the bottom there<br>so this basic perturber equation<br>as i say it's a<br>it tells you what how prices should be<br>i first came across this in 2006. um i<br>was asked at westpac to i just started<br>at westpac and the chief economist at<br>the time said<br>house prices are going through the roof<br>and we all know it's a bubble<br>but um why aren't rents rising and i i<br>discovered this equation and said well<br>rents aren't rising of course the price<br>to rent ratio has changed because<br>interest rates have plunged they've also<br>been some some<br>tax changes and inflation's higher which<br>is creating this expectation of capital<br>gain and that's why the price to rent<br>ratio has has changed and i later<br>realized well hang on rents<br>are really stable relative to income so<br>it's actually prices that do the<br>adjusting and ever since that point i've<br>been using this idea<br>to forecast house prices at westpac so<br>you can see um using that same equation<br>we calculate a sort of a theoretical<br>value of houses the net present value of<br>the future flow of rents we compare it<br>to actual house prices which is the blue<br>and we've made a number of really good<br>calls um<br>over time<br>about what's going to happen to the<br>housing market and most importantly<br>notably in june 2019 at westpac we<br>forecast a house price boom<br>interest rates were plunging um this<br>model was telling me there's lots of<br>upside in the housing market house<br>prices actually fell that quarter but<br>they were very very slow at the time the<br>other thing that happened was capital<br>gains tax was ruled out by the prime<br>minister um and we said i think house<br>prices are going to take off i do get a<br>little bit um<br>i get a bit upset when i hear people<br>saying that nobody predicted the the<br>house price upturn in fact<br>we we consistently forecast one from mid<br>2019 to the present um at least at<br>westpac<br>um and i think<br>you know in the spirit of things are<br>changing i think the past year for a lot<br>of other organizations has<br>brought this type of thinking to the<br>fore<br>at treasury for example we are<br>using this type of modeling and this<br>type of thinking to help with<br>forecasting and we are um we've we've<br>adjusted the sensitivity we you know<br>we've learned from the past year and we<br>are<br>you know anticipating that interest<br>rates will have or recognizing that<br>interest rates have a greater role in<br>determining house prices going forward<br>reserve banks the same they're using a<br>a similar model to<br>assess the sustainability of house<br>prices it's similar they're using a<br>different interest rate in their model<br>so there are differences makes it all<br>look sort of much smoother their sort of<br>theoretical house price valuation but it<br>kind of says the same thing which is<br>that look over the past<br>25 years<br>the left in-house prices is explainable<br>by the drop in interest rates<br>okay but as i mentioned um why would<br>well i yeah i think i think i've<br>explained that the price to rent ratio<br>needs to bear some relationship to<br>interest rates so therefore interest<br>rates<br>when interest rates change price to rent<br>ratio needs to change<br>but how do we know which out of prices<br>and rents moves<br>and on that well it turns out<br>that the land market really matters<br>the availability of land really matters<br>then take a step back here and run<br>through<br>i'm just going to get you to imagine two<br>different worlds<br>one where land is completely fixed in<br>supply<br>and one where land is very very abundant<br>i'll start with the abundant land idea<br>because i think that underpins many of<br>the traditional ideas<br>in housing market thinking in new<br>zealand and and underpinned a lot of<br>research on the housing market<br>as i say that came out of the us in the<br>1960s<br>so this the usual assumption is that<br>there's lots of land and if you need<br>more of it<br>for for a city's growth all you need to<br>do is<br>buy more offer off the farmers at the<br>edge of town<br>so land prices are therefore sort of<br>fixed at what land is worth to a farmer<br>and yes land prices kind of<br>are higher closer to the central city<br>but the whole curve is kind of set by<br>what what land is worth at the edge of<br>town that kind of is a real anchor to<br>land prices throughout the city<br>now in this idea that there's plenty of<br>land and we can just always get more off<br>the farmer off the farmers at the edge<br>of town well<br>house prices land prices are fixed and<br>therefore houses should really trade at<br>the land price plus the cost to build<br>new ones<br>after all if if they didn't if they say<br>house prices were above land price plus<br>cost to build well people would go out<br>buy land off some farmers at that fixed<br>price<br>build the houses<br>increase supply and bring prices back to<br>this land price plus cost to build and<br>this is known as tobin's queue and it's<br>probably<br>a key idea<br>that has driven this thinking about<br>construction costs the link between<br>construction costs and house prices<br>and in this model<br>well we know that the rent to price<br>ratio has to be a relationship to the<br>interest rate through the perturber<br>equation<br>we know that<br>house prices are sort of anchored to<br>land price plus cost to build so it<br>should be rents that adjust you know<br>interest rates fall it should be rents<br>that fall to make the rent price ratio<br>make sense<br>so again in this world just to trace<br>through you know drop in construction<br>costs let's say we<br>we um free up the construction market<br>engineer a drop in construction costs<br>well that'll change the cost to build<br>house prices will come down<br>rent-a-price ratio still needs to<br>reflect what's going on with interest<br>rates so rents will come down to and<br>if interest rates change as i say drop<br>in interest rates will happen<br>actually at first what would happen is<br>there'd be a lot of demand to buy houses<br>because investors would know well they<br>can borrow money now buy a house and<br>rent it out so that there'd be more<br>demand to buy houses<br>that would stimulate construction<br>activity so house prices would go up<br>stimulate construction activity until<br>house prices fell<br>back to that land price plus cost to<br>build<br>and rents would also drop away so the<br>rent to price ratio makes sense and in<br>the long run you'd see a decline in<br>interest rates leading to<br>okay so that's one kind of extreme<br>assumption that we could be working with<br>let's just for a moment imagine a world<br>of completely fixed land supply so we're<br>singapore we're an island there's no<br>more land um<br>and i'll just trace through how things<br>work in that<br>world in that world the price of land is<br>free to deviate from its value to a<br>farmer<br>i mean it's it's fixed in supply there's<br>no real anchor to<br>what land<br>might be worth<br>or<br>or the anchor<br>is really what the owner of the land can<br>rent it out for<br>in the market<br>so rents actually become<br>the anchor to the system you know<br>there's a population there's um there's<br>a certain supply of land there's an<br>income level of the population you<br>imagine the old supply and demand curves<br>it's kind of a vertical supply curve and<br>a sloping demand curve and you end up<br>with a price for renting<br>land or property<br>per week<br>so rents get fixed by the population's<br>ability to pay<br>rent from the population<br>house prices are what adjust to satisfy<br>to make sure the rent price ratio makes<br>sense<br>and then we have to think about okay how<br>do you value land in that world no it's<br>called um<br>residual<br>residual value<br>so a plot of land is worth what you<br>could sell it for if you had a house on<br>now in this world<br>if you get construction costs down<br>all that does is change the residual<br>value of land<br>so again what you can rent<br>things out for is fixed<br>house prices are therefore have to be<br>the net present value future flow of<br>rents<br>the owner of an empty plot of land finds<br>that well construction costs have fallen<br>well it's cheaper for that person to put<br>a house on the land and sell it for the<br>going rate that house prices sell at so<br>the land is worth more<br>so drop in construction cost just gets<br>captured<br>by the land owners<br>and in this world when interest rates<br>drop<br>well what happens is the house<br>the rent to price ratio and rents are<br>anchored so it's prices house prices<br>that adjust<br>but over that actually gets captured by<br>landowners<br>and there is no change<br>in the<br>in the value of a house plus<br>land plus a house on top less the cost<br>to build so no reason<br>for a supply response of any kind<br>in other words change in interest rates<br>just gets captured entirely by the<br>by the way in both worlds both the<br>completely<br>abundant land and fixed land world<br>as i've mentioned before a migration<br>surge for example should lead to both<br>house prices and rents rising together<br>temporarily in the plentiful land world<br>what will happen<br>be a migration surge there'll be a<br>shortage of houses people who want to<br>buy them and rent them both prices will<br>go up house prices will exceed the land<br>price plus cost to build<br>more houses will be built<br>uh and prices will come back both prices<br>and rents will come back to where they<br>were before<br>so you should see both moving and it<br>should be temporary and it's kind of the<br>same thing for an earthquake or<br>government goes and builds a load of<br>houses<br>temporary<br>and both<br>prices and rents are going to be<br>affected<br>and it's it's the same thing in a fixed<br>land supply world<br>um<br>you you're going to get a big a lift in<br>demand to rent<br>which actually changes the fundamental<br>value<br>of a parcel of land and may encourage<br>the owners of the land to switch its use<br>from<br>farming to<br>urban land<br>that will is the supply response and<br>will bring both rents and prices back<br>down<br>the only thing is in this fixed land<br>supply world you should get a mostly<br>temporary lift in both rents and prices<br>but there is you know if you've got a<br>fixed asset you've got only so much land<br>and you're chucking more people at it<br>there probably is a fundamental change<br>in number of people versus<br>versus availability of land so you get<br>you will get some residual change in<br>both rents and prices<br>okay<br>so hopefully i've kind of worked through<br>the way the world should work<br>in the traditional assumption<br>and in the<br>this alternative world of a of sort of<br>fixed land supply or<br>difficulty in<br>expanding land supply<br>and let's think about different theories<br>of the house price boom and draw<br>conclusions about which is which so<br>if physical supply and demand of<br>dwellings is is your theory<br>you should see both rents and prices<br>rising and you should see differences in<br>price in house price inflation across<br>locations and as i say that just is not<br>what we observe in new zealand<br>if construction costs were there with a<br>driver you should see both house prices<br>and rents rising<br>you should see house price and<br>house price increases similar to<br>construction cost increases so that in<br>other words the price increase would be<br>mostly in the buildings not in the land<br>and that is absolutely not what we've<br>seen in new zealand over 20 years<br>if declining interest rates were the<br>driver well you'd see the house price to<br>rent ratio blowing out<br>you'd see house prices rising everywhere<br>around new zealand and around the world<br>and actually other asset prices would be<br>rising too you know shares<br>bitcoin everything would be going up<br>like crazy because interest rates have<br>fallen it's driving all assets up and<br>that's exactly what we see<br>and again<br>i have mentioned an interest rate<br>decline and if there was abundant land<br>it should drive rents down not prices up<br>so constrained urban land supply may be<br>part of the puzzle here too<br>because what we've seen over 20 years is<br>that interest rates drive prices not<br>rents<br>other evidence in favor of constrained<br>urban land supply is that rents are<br>relatively constant relative to income<br>suggesting that<br>owners of land are extracting what they<br>can<br>from from those who live on the land<br>and<br>the price increases that we see are<br>mostly in the land not the buildings<br>okay and then you know i've i've<br>characterized things here in a pretty<br>pretty um crude way i mean the truth is<br>that new zealand lies somewhere on a<br>continuum between<br>sort of fixed urban land supply and<br>perfectly elastic<br>land supply we don't know where we are<br>on that continuum and i mean i've got my<br>view there there's disagreement<br>there's lots of research on the topic<br>the housing technical working group that<br>i chair<br>this is the question i would really like<br>us to research and discover and probably<br>more importantly in a matter of more<br>debate<br>is what could shift<br>what could shift this<br>and how much is it possible to move<br>from a world where land supply is fixed<br>rents are<br>extractive<br>interest rates affect prices<br>through to a world of more elastic land<br>supply where where things work<br>differently and and more like what how<br>we would hope they would work<br>um and again that's that's a real<br>i think that's a real<br>debate and real question but i think<br>what you can see is that government<br>policy is moving is thinking more and<br>more<br>about where are we on this continuum<br>and how can we shift the dial<br>now the way you think about policy<br>really does change depending on which of<br>these worlds we're in and as i've said i<br>really want to emphasize new zealand<br>lies somewhere on a continuum and we<br>don't really know where on that<br>continuum it is but just moving back to<br>these caricatures of the extremes<br>again i've said you know construction<br>cost based policies well for example<br>land that's a great policy fixed land<br>supply not so much<br>boosting effective land supply obviously<br>that's<br>redundant if you've got plenty of land<br>and it's key if you think you're in this<br>constrained land supply world<br>it turns out that taxes though behave<br>quite differently<br>in different<br>depending on how how the world works<br>um i just want to skip over this<br>conscious of time<br>i think successive people are often<br>concerned that if we introduced a<br>capital gains tax<br>it would end up<br>um renters would end up paying the tax<br>effectively so rents would rise and that<br>that is actually<br>plentiful land model thinking<br>the underpinning of that idea is that<br>capital gains tax would come on there'd<br>be reduction in demand for houses<br>fewer of them would you know house<br>prices would drop below land price plus<br>cost to build fewer houses would get<br>built and over time that would lift<br>house prices back up to<br>land price plus cost to build but rents<br>would be higher so the capital gains tax<br>changes this perturber equation<br>and renters end up paying in the<br>plentiful land assumption<br>but i think um the real world is closer<br>to<br>this really constrained land supply idea<br>and actually in that world if you<br>introduce the capital gains tax<br>well rent remains pretty much fixed in<br>the market and it is house prices that<br>adjust<br>to things like a capital gains tax and<br>in fact<br>because cost to build is is what it is<br>it all gets bound up in the land price<br>so actually the incidence of a capital<br>gains tax would fall entirely on land<br>owners in a completely fixed land supply<br>world<br>um<br>so i just<br>just perhaps to go back to<br>policy points that kind of<br>you know matter for this<br>things like a rent to buy scheme kind of<br>works in either world restricting<br>migration or building houses<br>is probably actually only a temporary<br>response in either world and the one i<br>haven't written down is is reserve bank<br>and i just do want to emphasize that<br>reserve bank could no long could no more<br>have prevented interest rates from<br>falling away<br>um<br>uh then king canute could have stopped<br>the tide<br>things that would help us out<br>so how do you go about boosting<br>effective land supply and i'm a little<br>bit conscious of time here so i can't<br>spend long on it<br>but you know what do we mean by shifting<br>the dial and boosting effective land<br>supply<br>you need to<br>just have a few ideas here you need to<br>create land market competition within<br>the city so this is not necessarily<br>about allowing cities to grow on the<br>outside it's about<br>if you restrict the use of land inside<br>the city by<br>restricting intensification for example<br>then<br>effectively you are restricting the<br>supply of new land available for new<br>development<br>so this is the thinking behind the the<br>recent change where the government has<br>really created quite a high burden for<br>councils to be able to stop people from<br>building houses dwellings or buildings<br>that are three stories high<br>you do want to also create competition<br>at the edge of the city so rural urban<br>boundaries maybe need to be rethought<br>but a key thing is the effective supply<br>of land<br>really depends on the availability of<br>infrastructure<br>if people can't get to a location<br>effectively then it effectively is<br>outside of the pool of available urban<br>land so infrastructure both to the edge<br>of the city and within the city become<br>really important<br>you can't just fix up one city<br>because<br>then people would pour into other cities<br>and use up the available land there this<br>needs to be a nationwide effort and what<br>we need to do is ensure that incentives<br>and institutions are aligned to um<br>freeing up land supply in new zealand<br>so the key point here is<br>there's a big difference<br>between<br>the supply of dwellings and the supply<br>of land and i'm not so sure the supply<br>of dwellings is influential for<br>house prices in new zealand i think it's<br>actually the supply of land we need to<br>focus on<br>interest rates are a key driver of of<br>house prices<br>the best measure of the price of housing<br>is its rental<br>or what's it costing you to tie up your<br>capital in a house it's not really the<br>sticker price<br>and<br>taxation should perhaps<br>capital gains tax or similar<br>should be thought about differently if<br>we do believe we're in this world of<br>constrained land supply<br>okay so um so that's that's me i've<br>gotten through it in<br>40 minutes and i've got a few minutes<br>for questions if um<br>if that's okay<br>great you'll get a little bit of echo<br>thank you very very much uh dominique um<br>you might wanna just open the chat we've<br>had a comment already from jeff in there<br>you want to have a look look and we've<br>got a couple minutes of questions so<br>we've got some uh roving mics here that<br>we're just gonna start throwing around<br>the room who'd like to go first in the<br>no i don't got any and you want to<br>comment on any of the things in the chat<br>there dominic<br>okay<br>so i think that we've got from jeff<br>thompson uh<br>liking what you're saying um and linking<br>to the interest rate environment course<br>oh yeah so hopefully beginning increases<br>in the ocr will take the heat out of the<br>market yes so you saw the reserve bank<br>come out the other day<br>um they're forecasting a modest decline<br>in house prices over<br>2023-24 and the basis of that<br>is higher interest rates so yes<br>mortgage rates have risen a lot<br>um and yes that'll start to take the<br>heat out of the market in fact it<br>probably already is we're seeing straws<br>thanks do we have any questions in the<br>room<br>right at the back<br>i think rachel's gonna<br>we we have these throw my these big<br>throw boxes dominic but rachel's not<br>quite<br>confident enough with her throwing<br>um i it's sorry i'm not sure i can't<br>hear anything so i think rachel's on<br>mute<br>it might be because i might need to have<br>that unlinked sorry about that i thought<br>that was on the separate mic try again<br>we'll see if you can hear me<br>yeah<br>great so my apologies<br>um i just had a question you mentioned<br>um that's the<br>increase in population if i heard you<br>rightly that the immigrant population<br>had not contributed to house prices<br>but new zealand has had you know a one<br>million increase from four to five<br>million in the last 10 years<br>so just mine if you've expanded on your<br>comment just to help us out<br>again<br>if<br>if the big increase in population had<br>should affect both prices and rents<br>so over the past five years or so there<br>has been a bit of a lift in rents<br>relative to incomes and in particular<br>places<br>they have occasionally been<br>a bit of a lift and rents<br>but it's not the biggest driver<br>so again you can tell it's not that<br>migration doesn't affect house prices<br>it's that the observation is that it<br>affects both rents and prices<br>therefore if we<br>prices are<br>affected by many things whereas rents<br>are a cleaner<br>read on what's happening to physical<br>supply versus physical demand<br>um my observation is that yep there's<br>been a huge influx of people it's had a<br>modest effect on rents suggesting that<br>the influx of people's had only a modest<br>effect on prices<br>and that the drop in interest rates is<br>the main driver of higher prices<br>and actually over the past year we had a<br>nice natural experiment we dropped<br>interest rates a whole lot<br>we reduced population growth to really<br>low<br>lowest in 40 years<br>and<br>you know<br>what happened<br>prices went up 30<br>i think it's<br>the past year and a half has been<br>devastating to the view<br>that migration drives house prices<br>yes<br>thanks good question do you have<br>right here<br>well it's just so people it's people and<br>dominic can hear you yeah<br>um will house prices ever drop<br>yes of course they do all the time i<br>don't get the kiwi myth that they don't<br>drop they dropped in um they halved in<br>the 1970s in real terms in new zealand<br>so inflation was very high and house<br>price inflation was nil<br>they dropped in nominal terms in the<br>late 80s early 90s 1998 2001<br>2008<br>2010.<br>in japan they've dropped over 60 percent<br>in finland<br>they halved between the early 1990s and<br>and early 2010s house prices can and do<br>for<br>um in new zealand we've had a generation<br>who've<br>lived through a really big drop in<br>interest rates<br>which has led to a really big steady<br>increase in house prices relative to<br>rents and incomes and that makes perfect<br>sense but in the future<br>you know there could be a different set<br>of conditions that lead to<br>lower house prices relative to incomes<br>and rents but but hopefully<br>i've persuaded you that the sticker<br>price on a house is not actually the<br>right way to think about the cost of<br>housing<br>really a better measure of the cost of<br>housing is rents or<br>the cost of tying up your capital<br>in that sticker price which depends on<br>the interest rate<br>dominic i can't see there's a couple of<br>um questions come through on the chat so<br>you maybe want to just pick one of those<br>to close um off um from that and if you<br>can read the ads just so those in the<br>room can you can see that as well<br>okay so do you do did you do research on<br>the impact of speculators on house<br>prices and what about real estate agents<br>in their manipulation of the market i<br>said estate agents have the ability to<br>control who who houses are shown and<br>therefore the prices are influenced as<br>well<br>um the thing about that is i don't see<br>any reason that speculation and the<br>behavior of estate agents would be any<br>different now<br>than it was 10 years ago or 20 years ago<br>probably the other thing is<br>that i think a lot of the time there's<br>been a huge change in house prices and<br>it doesn't really square with what's<br>happened to population growth and<br>construction so people assume it's a<br>bubble or needs some explanation but one<br>of the things i illustrated is it's<br>perfectly explainable<br>by the decline in interest rates that<br>dominic thank you so much for joining us<br>from auckland hope you get back down to<br>wellington very very soon and it's been<br>really good to get this insight and to<br>challenge a few of our assumptions that<br>we might have in this area uh we're now<br>going to take a 25-minute break so for<br>those who are on campus with us on<br>wellington i'll explain in a moment<br>where we're going for morning tea for<br>those of you who are online take a<br>screen break grab yourself a coffee um<br>coffee and biscuits and we'll be back<br>here to start at 11 35 i will leave the<br>webinar open so that it will just<br>continue to to be there and things and<br>we'll join you in 25 minutes but first<br>of all can we say thank you to dominic<br>thank you so welcome back everyone<br>hopefully everyone has had an<br>opportunity to be um to grab a coffee<br>tea snacks etc for the second half of<br>our program<br>um i'll introduce our next week in a<br>moment but just to kind of give you a<br>little teaser for uh<br>last session of the day which will be<br>looking at the future of accounting<br>panel a couple of our panelists have<br>arrived already and eager to go and but<br>first of all we have my colleague um<br>associate professor christian schott and<br>christian has an as many of us doing our<br>uh work lives has many different hats<br>that he wears but one of them is the<br>coordinator of our steering committee<br>for the response the principles of<br>responsible management education or<br>prime which is linked to the un's<br>sustainable development goals and he's<br>going to touch a little bit on some of<br>that i think as part of uh today and<br>talk to us and looking at the idea of<br>keeping real the importance of situated<br>learning in the real world we go back 25<br>minutes with a couple minutes for<br>questions excellent i'll pass over to<br>christian<br>christian<br>so my name is christian shot i now call<br>island bay on the south coast of<br>wellington home mighty tapataranga<br>and<br>i really enjoy this opportunity to share<br>some of my<br>recent work<br>with people that work in schools where a<br>lot of what we do here<br>really is being sort of foreshadowed<br>i'm not sure that it is very similar to<br>ben's i suspect his was quite different<br>in tone<br>but hopefully nevertheless both have<br>some good value<br>and i realize that when i talk about<br>experiential learning and if i not talk<br>about situated experiential learning i'm<br>pretty much<br>talking to the converter because schools<br>have been doing this for a very long<br>time and they have been doing this very<br>well for a very long time<br>and it's more the universities that have<br>been catching up on this pedagogy that<br>it's not something that only young<br>younger students need but that's also<br>something that's beneficial for<br>young adults as well as adults to be<br>honest i don't know how you guys learn<br>best but i think many of us also<br>appreciate experiential learning<br>opportunities<br>so<br>it is about keeping it real i had to<br>come up with some kind of a title so i<br>thought i'd go for this<br>and as you can see the sdgs sit right in<br>the middle of all of this and<br>that is a good intro for me to give you<br>a little bit of background about this on<br>this role that karen just mentioned so<br>the united nations principles of<br>responsible management education which<br>we generally just refer to as as prime<br>because it's a lot easier<br>it's probably best explained by quickly<br>looking at the vision and the mission<br>prime's vision is to create a global<br>movement and drive thought leadership on<br>responsible management education<br>in business schools that is the very<br>place they are solely focused hence<br>prime's mission is to transform<br>management education and develop the<br>responsible decision makers of tomorrow<br>to advance sustainable development so we<br>take this role quite seriously that we<br>educate the people that will be leading<br>in the business world in the future<br>and the business world is actually other<br>key stakeholders who said hey we need to<br>have more responsible management<br>education at universities at business<br>schools before they come out into this<br>world<br>so<br>this is the<br>the logo that you may see around a<br>little bit and it's it's based on the<br>idea that you need to have six<br>principles that guide your journey<br>towards more responsible<br>management education to avoid the green<br>washing that comes easily by saying hey<br>yeah we do a lot um and for those of you<br>who are interested and who haven't yet<br>had a chance to pick up a hard copy and<br>who haven't yet had an opportunity to<br>look at a soft copy which is online<br>i think it's a good way of understanding<br>the whole faculty and what we do in that<br>space whether it's economics whether<br>it's management whether it's hr whether<br>it's marketing or accounting so we don't<br>we didn't print enough for everyone<br>because we thought that wouldn't be<br>quite sustainable<br>but there are digital copies available<br>and there's a reference one and maybe<br>you just pass them around<br>so that's what this is about and we fit<br>in<br>by<br>signing onto prime in 2014 so our<br>journey has already been seven years<br>and<br>the steering group some members are<br>represented here john randall is down<br>here on zoom very time appropriate he's<br>our associate dean<br>for certain student affairs but not all<br>anymore he's now at a university level<br>professor karen smith who you're<br>familiar with professor giroul kirigulu<br>who is<br>head of school of the school of<br>government<br>and this is<br>the student representative that joined<br>this particular meeting so we also have<br>the student<br>participation so you're welcome to try<br>out this qr code<br>um app to see whether you can get the<br>digital version<br>this is our most recent report which i<br>yeah invite you to have a look at it is<br>our third<br>so we've been on this journey for a<br>while<br>so that's a little bit of context<br>but for the rest of the presentation i<br>want to take a step back put on my<br>tourism management hat which is<br>sustainable tourism management and<br>basically build the context to my<br>presentation it strongly aligns to my<br>prime role because i have a passion for<br>teaching and learning and i have a<br>passion for sustainability<br>so<br>do we need a more sustainable future<br>yeah nah what do you think<br>maybe<br>well i look at this through tourism<br>management lens and<br>it's a bit concerning<br>so you will have seen these images you<br>may have used these images in your own<br>teaching<br>but of course the worrying thing is is<br>that tourism actually plays a<br>significant role<br>in many of these<br>and the specific one here is a quad<br>revealing report that was published<br>already a couple of years ago that said<br>that tourism contributed eight percent<br>of the global greenhouse gas emissions<br>eight percent it's not food production<br>it's not clothing it's not essential<br>things<br>but something that many regard is<br>something that's nice to have<br>but not crucial for the world's survival<br>but then you keep<br>going through this so we know tourism<br>makes contributions to climate change<br>but then we also have that other side of<br>the<br>social and the cultural impacts of<br>tourism<br>so here the story was published in the<br>newspaper big outrage in rome because<br>these are historic fountains you don't<br>swim in but tourists take that<br>opportunity<br>when you go to peru and you're british<br>karen<br>so<br>these things happen but they're often<br>deeply offensive to the local people<br>when you go to bali<br>i would hope that many of us wouldn't<br>see this as a spectacle to exchange<br>sunbathing for quick cultural viewing<br>for something that is a quite a sacred<br>hindi protocol and process<br>so<br>there are lots and lots of things that<br>aren't going right with tourism<br>and<br>while many will enjoy the full moon<br>parties of thailand and there's probably<br>also something positive to be said about<br>it although i'm not sure that drugs will<br>save your life<br>this is often the aftermath of those<br>hedonistic ventures and of course this<br>in itself has huge implications<br>all of this will disappear but not<br>because somebody goes around and cleans<br>it up and this is another direct impact<br>which then turns into indirect impact of<br>tourism so<br>we can look at this endlessly tourism<br>plays a significant role and the real<br>issue<br>is the social license to operate tourism<br>where communities in new zealand and<br>abroad are beginning to say<br>we are actually not interested in<br>tourism anymore we don't want tourism<br>and that's a big problem not because my<br>job is sustainable tourism management<br>but because tourism also brings so many<br>positives which i'm sure you're more<br>familiar with so i won't go over those<br>but the negatives are really beginning<br>to cause a lot of trouble<br>and it's not just in barcelona it's also<br>in venice and arguably even in parts of<br>new zealand where communities are saying<br>terrorism is not quite or this type of<br>tourism is not what we signed up for and<br>that is creating a big problem<br>so as an educator how do we approach<br>this we try and educate on truly<br>sustainable tourism so this is the<br>framework that i use<br>which is probably too complex to to go<br>over now but it basically takes a very<br>holistic view and it should allow us to<br>resolve most of those<br>issues<br>if we approach the development and the<br>management of tourism<br>in a sustainable ideally even<br>regenerative way<br>but of course what we have done for a<br>long time is to take this very abstract<br>concept and convert it into real<br>learning is use situated experiential<br>learning field trips<br>been doing them forever<br>and they have been really powerful many<br>people will have strongest memories of<br>their school days or university times on<br>the field trips because it's not just<br>educational development it's also<br>personal development<br>but of course<br>there are many reasons why we we use<br>this pedagogy and<br>as i said earlier universities have some<br>appreciation of it but experiential<br>learning is probably more on the heart<br>sciences and geology geography<br>in the disciplines where they really see<br>the importance of seeing and<br>experiencing and feeling the field<br>in the business school it's really not<br>that common<br>but going back to the to the pedagogies<br>it is recognized as increasing learner<br>engagement because they are part of it<br>active learning is a really crucial part<br>of it enhanced subject knowledge because<br>they are again in the moment in the<br>field and they test their own knowledge<br>against what's happening around them and<br>ultimately and this is i think one of<br>the really cool things the lifelong<br>learning<br>the situated aspect to just give you<br>that or reestablish that framing<br>is really about the idea that we<br>position learning in the place where it<br>matters if it's too abstracted students<br>often struggle to apply it once they are<br>in a real-world situation<br>so<br>all that stuff will be very familiar to<br>you so now clearly if we wanted to learn<br>about climate change coastal erosion and<br>the impacts of tourism on fijian island<br>we should take them<br>to take our students to fiji right<br>makes sense<br>well<br>we've got a problem<br>got a big problem and this problem has<br>now been going on for two years and it<br>will probably continue to go on for some<br>time yet<br>so this article makes the point that<br>whole generations of students are<br>missing out on experiential learning<br>and situated<br>experiential learning in particular<br>so this is a problem even when that<br>passes we have another problem<br>which is<br>that if we take our students let's say<br>we take 91 students and five staff which<br>is probably a good ratio to a community<br>in fiji we will contribute<br>123 tons<br>of carbon emissions equivalent<br>that's quite a lot and the reason we are<br>in fiji is to learn about climate change<br>so we've got a problem<br>because that of course that connection<br>is very problematic<br>so really we have to put to question<br>whether we can still exercise situated<br>experiential learning in the way that we<br>have for the last hundred years<br>so with a colleague<br>of mine because we are passionate about<br>it what are our alternatives<br>we can show people videos<br>it's pretty cool<br>we can give them book chapters that were<br>written a while ago we can give them<br>reports but what can we really do to<br>help them understand<br>something that happens in the pacific<br>islands so we sat down looked at a lot<br>of the literature looked at the pedagogy<br>on experiential learning on<br>various aspects of the learning<br>experience the learning process and<br>identify that much of what happens<br>in experiential learning we can actually<br>take in a virtual reality environment<br>which is where this is going<br>and if we can do that then we can<br>actually offer opportunities for active<br>learning because the learner is in<br>charge<br>experiential learning because of this<br>active experience and it is fully<br>situated because we<br>position the learning in the place<br>where it matters<br>so this is the<br>the<br>framework the conceptualization that we<br>published which has actually<br>had some quite good feedback and mostly<br>i think it works because we based it on<br>a real learning tool so we<br>conceptualized it we trialled it and it<br>led to some good outcomes<br>the way that this can be experienced is<br>either through full virtual reality this<br>is the htc vive pro that we were using<br>or which is more realistic for a lot of<br>schools as a screen based version<br>exactly the same learnings tool can be<br>used on a computer<br>this is what it looks like sorry the the<br>top that is obscured by the uh<br>or the zoom thing so it basically says<br>the the<br>learning tool which is the first that we<br>developed<br>which is taking the idea of digital<br>immersion experiential learning about a<br>place its people its cultural world view<br>and its climate change and<br>sustainability challenges all together<br>pretty much in the way that we would<br>have done a field trip my background is<br>in geography i would have taken students<br>there i would have given them a task we<br>would have prepared beforehand and then<br>they would have gone out every day<br>do their research come back in the<br>evening debrief work on their project<br>this is the same idea<br>without the context of the place the<br>people the culture you can't do that<br>project effectively so you can't work<br>out what sustainability challenges and<br>solutions are if you don't understand<br>the way of life their conditions<br>so as you can see here climate change is<br>a real issue for them coastal erosion is<br>a real issue the village was actually<br>moved because of inundation<br>the hurricane ivan that went through<br>there totaled the school so they had to<br>rebuild it the church was completely<br>destroyed which is<br>a corner piece of the community with<br>very little finances to rebuild it so<br>these things are really happening out<br>there and possibly more so than if we<br>look around dwelling where we think you<br>know we're probably okay others might<br>have more problems than we do<br>and the way we really bring this to life<br>is through the cultural context and then<br>the videos they're embedded all<br>throughout the island<br>where they were recorded<br>so we try to be really true<br>to what we what we did on the island the<br>topography the layout some of the<br>distances<br>because for the students to be able to<br>talk to the community members is what<br>really makes this a learning tool<br>otherwise it's just sort of a spatial<br>tool<br>and they talk to them about tourism<br>sustainability challenges but also their<br>aspirations for the future<br>what do they want the island to look<br>like in their community in 2030 which is<br>when the sdgs should be achieved which i<br>think nobody really thinks will be but<br>it's a great aspirational law<br>and the fijian cultural context is<br>crucial here so the first thing that we<br>did when we landed on the island and the<br>first thing that the students need to do<br>is go through an isebu cebu which is the<br>culturally appropriate welcoming process<br>it's like a portfolio<br>and without it you actually not welcome<br>on their lands because these are<br>ancestral tribal lands that are owned by<br>this<br>travel community<br>but also throughout as you talk to<br>people when you talk to the nurse<br>you understand about what is acceptable<br>in the community and what is not<br>acceptable<br>when you<br>experience the students you also<br>understand their conditions when you<br>talk to the young women in the village<br>you appreciate that their views are also<br>slightly different to the elders in the<br>village<br>because they are the next generation<br>they have wishes<br>when you talk to the<br>the guy that sometimes works as a tour<br>guide he interprets the environment<br>around us and which areas are taku and<br>for what reason they're toppled how<br>would you know<br>so all of this this is really just a<br>snapshot they're about 18<br>interviews with all different<br>stakeholders that's the idea that<br>stakeholder framework is brought in life<br>here<br>and<br>in terms of analysis this learning tool<br>actually dates back to 2011 so it's a<br>very early example of it it was<br>initially built on<br>something called open sim which was a an<br>open source version of second life does<br>anyone remember that<br>and then in 2015 we were able to migrate<br>into unity which is really much more of<br>a game engine then we were able to<br>go into the vr space<br>and we've been playing around a bit<br>interestingly we're going from the vr<br>space back into the screen based version<br>because<br>that's how we can democratize this<br>experience that's where the<br>the learners are predominantly<br>so just to give you some insight into<br>some of the student feedback sorry about<br>that yellow screen<br>realistically the only thing we can<br>compare it to is a text-based case study<br>or some other way of providing this<br>learning<br>because at the moment we don't really<br>realistically have other options yes we<br>can link them with videos<br>but in all those cases<br>it is a different learning experience so<br>what i was particularly interested in is<br>the the barriers to learning motivation<br>and then enjoyment if we can break down<br>those barriers we can really do a lot<br>with our students<br>and this is where interestingly or maybe<br>not that surprisingly particularly those<br>students that typically weren't the most<br>engaged<br>became really passionate about this<br>and one of the we trialled this in two<br>schools one of the<br>the classes was a pedagogically based<br>voice only class<br>and they are the ones that according to<br>the teachers got the most out of this it<br>settled them down it gave them something<br>really positive interactive to do<br>and it wasn't just the accelerators<br>classes that that benefited<br>so motivation to learn and enjoyment of<br>learning were really perceived well the<br>other thing in the context of keeping it<br>real<br>is that students had no doubts that this<br>was based on reality we didn't make this<br>up we didn't contrive it for our own<br>benefit to sort of make the case for a<br>particular theory<br>they agreed that we tried to replicate a<br>real environment with real people for<br>real learning purposes<br>and the overall impact on learning was<br>also good so we still have<br>a little bit of work to do about the<br>ability to identify key issues which is<br>crucial to this kind of<br>real life based learning and<br>understanding the key issues<br>but again you could also ask questions<br>about what was their level of true<br>engagement with the learning tool to put<br>in the effort it's like a field trip if<br>you just sit down behind the corner you<br>don't go around and interview people<br>you're not going to learn that much<br>and internationally it's the the whole<br>concept has done very well in december<br>it won the<br>gold award for sustainability at the<br>reimagined education awards<br>so it's it's tracking quite well based<br>on this success<br>sorry i should also go through this<br>first so then we also<br>did some<br>research on the user experience because<br>we need to understand more about how<br>this impacts our users and these aspects<br>are really crucial to understanding<br>virtual reality and what virtual reality<br>can do for meaningful learning<br>and<br>this diagram looks at the areas that are<br>high in experiential benefit and high in<br>emotion and effect<br>and also going beyond the instrumentals<br>for the more intangible aspects<br>and the things that matter most are in<br>this quadrant which is really positive<br>the sense of place was<br>really high the natural movement that<br>comes with being in a vr world was<br>perceived as really positive the sensory<br>appeal all the things that makes this a<br>a real and a real feeling<br>learning tool<br>now<br>on the opposite quadrant where<br>everything was negative was the big<br>issue of motion sickness<br>initially<br>it's not us that are resolving this it's<br>google it's htc it's the people that<br>have<br>thousands of developers they're<br>resolving this and they have pretty much<br>already resolved it<br>the other things around hardware<br>concerns again are being worked on the<br>hyper real experience is being worked on<br>so we've got billions of dollars<br>invested on this so<br>clearly we need to take a critical and<br>nuanced view but the positive for me is<br>that the key aspects that really make<br>this into a an experiential learning<br>environment seem to be quite present<br>and based on that success we then<br>developed one just two years ago with<br>the funding from the latin america<br>center of asia pacific excellence that<br>is about peru<br>machu picchu some of you may have been<br>there in a former life before the world<br>changed forever so you may remember but<br>realistically how long will it be before<br>we can go back even if you have your own<br>case studies<br>how long will it be before you can go<br>that collect your case study bring it<br>back package it up for your schools and<br>do it with your students<br>so luckily this was just before covert i<br>went back to demonstrate the learning<br>tool in<br>november 2019<br>to show it to the community and then of<br>course february 2020<br>game over<br>so these are some images that show you<br>what this one looks like the technology<br>has moved on it's much higher<br>quality experience<br>and it again takes the multi-stakeholder<br>approach<br>where you have all the different<br>perspectives represented it's actually<br>targeted at social studies because what<br>is tourism<br>tourism is a social science essentially<br>lots and lots of different disciplines<br>are coming into it but it is about<br>understanding<br>the whole it's understanding about and<br>it's about understanding the community<br>the natural environment the impacts on<br>it the positive it brings the negatives<br>etc etc<br>and that means we also have the most<br>disempowered and uh have a voice in this<br>as well as the mayor<br>so if you are<br>interested in this this is freely<br>available to any school we've had<br>downloads even from ecuador<br>interestingly enough<br>so<br>um there are resources associated to it<br>and we currently<br>targeted at years<br>7<br>through 210 but the main focus being<br>years 9 and 10<br>social studies education but hey if i<br>was a tourism teacher i would use it<br>because it's about tourism and tourism<br>is just a lens on the issues and the<br>dynamics that play out in the community<br>so yeah i would invite you to check it<br>out if it doesn't suit that's great if<br>it doesn't also great and i'm sure i'm<br>on time<br>i mean i'm out of time meaning i'm time<br>a couple minutes for questions right so<br>thank you<br>that was the presentation which<br>hopefully had some interesting elements<br>um i think it is it is the videos it's<br>it's<br>and some students actually talked about<br>it it's<br>seeing a face and being able to link<br>that information to that face was really<br>powerful for them<br>but that face is positioned in the<br>context where it matters and i think<br>often we don't even think about it but<br>the context we just grab as information<br>we contextualize what we see and what we<br>learned within that context so when we<br>strip<br>that information off that context<br>suddenly it's quite a different dynamic<br>so the videos are absolutely the main<br>resource<br>yeah<br>that would be great but<br>um we would turn the island into a bit<br>of a theme park<br>where you know a red bell goes on in the<br>middle of the village and they need to<br>run to their devices because there's a<br>student from wellington who wants to<br>talk to them so unfortunately we can't<br>do that we did think about layering<br>questions and having different responses<br>available depending on the questions<br>with some ai mechanism<br>but<br>i'm not 100 on board with that yet<br>because the the risk is that it becomes<br>so gamified that it seems a bit<br>contrived again<br>but yeah good good questions and that<br>would be the gold standard when you have<br>those live interactions<br>but you know they have already given so<br>much<br>it's very difficult for us to say hey<br>can you<br>well in that case<br>thank you very much uh christian i'm<br>just gonna stop the actually just the<br>show on for a moment thank you very much<br>christian for sharing that it's an<br>awesome tool to have a looking even if<br>you're not planning to use it directly<br>into your own classroom at the moment<br>something to share with your colleagues<br>back at school as well it's a really<br>valuable resource and i think you know<br>the wider we can get this out and have<br>students in engaging particularly as we<br>say when times were actually those study<br>tools that we know our students really<br>value as part of of many courses just<br>aren't able to happen in the same way so<br>thank you christian thank you karen and<br>thank you<br>just gonna say thank you to the people<br>on zoom that i never saw but thank you<br>okay so we're just gonna take a two<br>minute pause while we just do a little<br>bit of furniture arranging and get that<br>panel so<br>take a moment have a breather and we'll<br>be back in two minutes<br>all right everybody<br>so i can't believe it already on our<br>last session the time has flown and<br>flown by and we thought a great way to<br>end uh end today's um today's program<br>was to try something a little bit<br>different to bring in a panel partly<br>because you couldn't decide who the best<br>person to speak about this was we kept<br>coming up with too many names and<br>realized actually a panel is a really<br>great way to explore an issue like the<br>future of accounting i'm going to pass<br>over now to dr cinderella george who is<br>one of our senior lecturers in<br>accounting she's actually currently the<br>acting undergraduate program director<br>for accounting also head of our<br>financial accounting teaching team so<br>knows a lot about it herself but her<br>role today is to introduce our panelists<br>throw them a few questions and then<br>we'll open it up and again we'll take<br>questions through the chat for those of<br>you online and we'll get the throw mics<br>going as well but i think you've got<br>some opening questions first of all<br>thank you for the introduction karen<br>hello everyone so i feel a little bit<br>awkward usually i'm standing when i'm<br>delivering a picture it's so lovely to<br>see so many of you here i'm trying to<br>catch an eye out for a teacher that i<br>know which i already do<br>to my economics teacher from high school<br>um i wanted to start off by saying how<br>special this is these<br>programs that were so special for me<br>because my commerce teachers had such an<br>impact on my my own decision um to study<br>accounting and to study commerce i was<br>on a very different path to study<br>actually medicine um and i really<br>enjoyed accounting and economics so much<br>i<br>turned completely in a different in a<br>different track and i've never looked<br>back<br>so i decided to do a phd on it that's<br>how much i've i loved it and i'm so<br>privileged here today to be able to<br>introduce our incredible panelists who<br>were so willing and ready to be a part<br>of this so thank you so much so we have<br>anthony hiffman in um accounting<br>director from accounting standards<br>director from the xrb um with rebecca<br>kennedy with presenting cairns chadwick<br>new zealand australia we have daniel<br>mccoy here from media so a really great<br>eclectic group of practitioners um<br>profession um<br>and standard sitters so we're so lucky<br>to have your voices here today so thank<br>you so much for being here so the panel<br>as i think the title is the future of<br>accounting and we really wanted a<br>positive outlook for for this panel<br>today um given some of the negative<br>press that i think accounting is getting<br>at the moment um and certainly that's<br>what we teach or how we're teaching<br>accounting at university today so it is<br>i think people are quite surprised to<br>see so i teach<br>the first 100 level course that students<br>come through in terms of accounting<br>about 700 students all commerce majors<br>some have decided to do accounting some<br>haven't my job is to change their views<br>and to make them realize actually how<br>exciting um and how<br>important and influential accounting is<br>in society that it's not just number<br>counting um you actually don't have to<br>be very good with numbers<br>and this is what we're here today to<br>understand our catalyst perspectives on<br>these questions so i have my starting<br>question<br>i'm going to read it out because i took<br>some time to write this um i'm writing a<br>book at the moment um<br>for activists how they can use<br>accounting reports and their social<br>movement activism um whether it's labor<br>unions or environmental<br>activists and so i sort of this came<br>from from that<br>um from a question to the panelists is<br>many commentators like the guardians<br>global environmental editor jonathan<br>watts and historian jane gleason white<br>have proposed that recent developments<br>in accounting like integrated reporting<br>and the new climate-related disclosures<br>have made accountants potential agents<br>of social and environmental change<br>others have declared that not all heroes<br>wear capes especially accountants<br>referencing the vital role that<br>accountants can play in helping<br>businesses secure funds and stay afloat<br>what do you think can accountants save<br>the planet our accountants heroes and<br>heroines in their own right um and what<br>do you see that's two questions two<br>questions already and also what do you<br>see<br>as the current and future role of the<br>accounting profession so let's start<br>with can accountant save the planet and<br>are they heroes and heroines in their<br>own right<br>she start rebecca because i know you're<br>passionate on this subject<br>done i actually purposely sat in the<br>middle as a tactic because i'm like<br>surely no matter which side i am she's<br>not gonna start with me and i teach<br>strategy too i should have been better<br>so i guess the first thing i want to say<br>is often when we have these discussions<br>we start off with calling it the future<br>of the accounting profession and i<br>really hate that really so<br>it's predicated on this assumption that<br>we have to question whether accounting<br>actually has a future so instead i want<br>to flip it and say what is the<br>accounting profession of the future<br>because accounting absolutely does have<br>a future as a profession i think the<br>future has never looked brighter for<br>accountants for the profession and for<br>the value that we can add so<br>how about we start with that awesome<br>um<br>i have to say the last present was<br>fantastic i really enjoyed that and it's<br>a great um preamble to what we've been<br>talking what we'll be talking about<br>um<br>really wise quote<br>questions as i started to think about it<br>to be honest this morning<br>i realized i had a lot to say about it<br>so i have made some some notes<br>so we'll see how we go<br>but just to give a bit of backdrop my<br>day job is director of accounting<br>standards at the external reporting<br>board so we're charged with developing<br>standards that are used by the listed<br>companies the new zealand government<br>private companies registered charities<br>and soon to be all in court well most of<br>incorporated societies that's a new<br>developments come through so we always<br>think about these multi-sectors um<br>there's probably enough of that to say<br>there's a future in reporting<br>because all these different entities<br>will need to follow standards issued by<br>the external reporting board not all of<br>them but thousands and thousands of<br>entities will need to and they'll need<br>qualified accountants that understand<br>these standards<br>so absolutely for a starting point no<br>question that there's a future<br>while my world is focused on the<br>financial reporting on the director of<br>accounting standards and very focused on<br>the debits and the credits and the<br>financial statements<br>there's no question that the world of<br>financial or external reporting is<br>changing<br>i think that's best illustrated through<br>the vision of the external reporting<br>board which really shows the changing<br>and accounting industry<br>city standards for news that allowed new<br>zealand to prosper through effective<br>decision making and informed by high<br>quality trusted and integrated<br>reporting<br>and all of us are trying to work out<br>what that integrated reporting means<br>it's not just financial statements it's<br>not debits and credits not just about<br>the math<br>the future of accounting and what we're<br>talking about we hear so many terms<br>being banded about<br>we hear about<br>climate reporting we hear about esg<br>environmental social governance<br>reporting<br>we hear about sustainability reporting<br>we hear about<br>sdg reporting<br>sustainability development goals and<br>about 60 percent of new zealand<br>companies are already reporting against<br>those un sdg goals<br>so accountants have a role in all that<br>type of external reporting<br>the expectations on accountants have<br>gone through the roof<br>again it's not just the financial<br>reporting<br>accountants are the trusted advisor<br>they're expected to have all the answers<br>for all this type of reporting so it's<br>an exciting it's a challenging time<br>for those accountants that want to be<br>brave they can definitely be changing<br>the world<br>so that's bit of my<br>state of the nation speech<br>uh think about the actual questions you<br>asked<br>i'm sorry we're not taking too much time<br>um<br>so answering your direct questions um<br>can accountants save the world<br>and this is a question i'm asking myself<br>every day and i had a discussion with<br>the deputy director<br>at<br>the office of elder degener about this<br>where this little discussion every<br>thursday we meant to be talking about<br>other things we always<br>it feels like we're starting to turn<br>into old men sitting at the rsa talk<br>about how the problems of the world and<br>how can we change it<br>so we start off with a bit of a dark hat<br>in the response to can account and save<br>the world and have to say at one level<br>no<br>um the only way we can change the world<br>is through a global response from world<br>leaders and the best world leaders and<br>the smartest people we've got together<br>recently at cop 26 uh 28<br>and they're still trying to come up with<br>the answers so one level no requires an<br>international response<br>over the other level<br>definitely yes and i'm very comfortable<br>in the statement that accountants<br>i want to come up with a new term for<br>accountants but um account definitely<br>accountants have a part to play in a key<br>role<br>and um real change around sustainability<br>environmental cannot happen without<br>accountants in the room<br>and accountants are in the room they're<br>coming up with the um<br>assisting organizations they're<br>assisting governments they're assisting<br>directors around developing the strategy<br>they're assisting organizations around<br>identifying the risks<br>and then you get into the area where<br>accountants are a little bit more<br>comfortable they're assessing<br>performance and they're coming up with<br>the metrics of assessing climate change<br>but again that's not different credits<br>that's all new stuff<br>that's where the xrb we've dramatically<br>changed the last six months and i go<br>into the office and it's full of<br>scientists<br>um that need to work with the<br>accountants to come up with the answers<br>so it's um it's amazing stuff<br>so yeah accountants definitely have a<br>role hand to play changing the world<br>uh your second question<br>i might pause on the second question go<br>to others and that's around the future<br>role but i'll set it up for them thank<br>you<br>and thank you very much for that i know<br>something that my students get so<br>excited about is by the idea that they<br>could be environmental accountants or<br>human rights accountants um<br>and it's a you know they think of all<br>the exciting opportunities rather and<br>that very narrow view of what accounting<br>is or could be general do you have any<br>perspective on this you know it's<br>definitely an interesting one um i<br>suppose you're talking about you know<br>getting away from the term you know<br>accountants as such our team is a<br>business advisory team we do so much<br>more than standard accounting compliance<br>work and i suppose while we can't<br>directly save the planet and what we do<br>we can certainly help our clients tell<br>their story about what they're doing in<br>their efforts to do that we can look at<br>our other clients that are doing things<br>in that space and<br>able to provide insights to our other<br>clients based on what we've learned<br>elsewhere as far as the future of<br>accounting i i was here<br>virtually did a guest lecture a few<br>months back and that was sort of one of<br>the areas we spoke about and<br>for me<br>i was told you know accounting is a<br>dying profession when i was at school by<br>science teachers<br>sorry no disrespect to them but uh i<br>think there's just again it's that<br>misconception and misunderstanding about<br>what accountants do<br>and<br>sort of going back to that one oh<br>computers are going to replace<br>accountants well yes computers have been<br>doing accounting work since the 1950s<br>that's one of the things that they were<br>used for predominantly when they were<br>first introduced and<br>we sort of spoke about how we've gone<br>from you know punch cards and tapes to<br>cloud-based technology and how we're<br>able to leverage that to take people<br>away from the drudgery and the data<br>entry work where mistakes happen i think<br>it's vitally important for students<br>to understand the<br>basics of accounting the debits and<br>credits and i'm devastated with what's<br>happening with level one accounting with<br>nzqa at the moment i think that's<br>absolutely disgusting<br>but uh<br>well on that night i've been tutoring a<br>student in year 11 accounting i've taken<br>from just scraping a's to getting 23 out<br>of 24 in his mock so i'm quite proud of<br>that but it's sort of<br>like while the computer and xero can<br>produce the accounts the reports and sap<br>can produce the accounts reports you've<br>got to actually have the understanding<br>about what the numbers are saying at the<br>end of the day you've got to know how<br>the computer is getting<br>where it is you've got to know what's an<br>asset what's an expense once students<br>well from my personal experience doing<br>level one accounting was once you click<br>to the debits and credits the whole<br>thing falls into place and once<br>until that happens it does feel like<br>you're learning greek and nothing sort<br>of makes sense but then everything falls<br>into place and my concern is without<br>level one accounting that's either going<br>to mean that year 12 and year 13 is i<br>don't want to say dumbed down but that<br>content is going to have to get taught<br>at some point all the students are<br>really going to struggle with it<br>and it's vital for what we do and<br>business advisory to be able to sit down<br>on the client and explain something we<br>talk about you know performance<br>statistics and benchmark ratios what's<br>your gross profit percentage or your<br>liquid asset ratio and i was sitting<br>down explaining well<br>inventory is a current asset but it<br>takes a while to actually realize that<br>you might have to write it off you you<br>know it goes off you look at a shop like<br>dick smith for example those sort of<br>places had a whole lot of electronics in<br>stock and then new model tv comes out<br>next year and they're trying to throw<br>them out the door as soon as they can so<br>it sort of goes into a full circle<br>really<br>thank you i think that um so daniel just<br>lectured on our course last trimester<br>and<br>one of the um one of the themes was the<br>fact that technology hasn't been a<br>threat to accounting for rather an<br>opportunity<br>and it's sort of enabled accountants to<br>you know computerize and automate these<br>very mundane tasks and actually be able<br>to explore other opportunities for what<br>a profession now is and and could be so<br>um so my next question to the panelists<br>is<br>hopefully you've seen the question i'm<br>surprising you with this but um my<br>students often<br>uh<br>rather we have the study at big day<br>where we have the students come and they<br>explore the university unfortunately the<br>last two years we haven't been able to<br>to do it because of copenhagen but and i<br>think rebecca you may have gone on this<br>as well when you were on the um<br>uh kiosks but the question that i'm<br>repeatedly asked is do i need to be good<br>with numbers you know i'm not really<br>good at math my math grades aren't great<br>um and you know my friends or my<br>teachers or whoever the case might be<br>have told me maybe you shouldn't think<br>about accounting and so my question to<br>you is perhaps not that christian do you<br>need to be good with numbers but rather<br>what do you think are the cool skills<br>that an accountant whatever word we<br>who wants to start your big cup again is<br>that putting me on the spot<br>i'm terrible at numbers<br>i hate numbers i wanted to be an author<br>when i grew up i love words i love books<br>talk to me about classic literature i<br>love it i was on track to do a classics<br>degree um i hate numbers but i became an<br>accountant and i was a damn good one so<br>um it's not about number crunching at<br>all the way i think about it is that<br>accountants are storytellers<br>and the numbers are just the language<br>that we use to tell the story of a<br>business because what is a business it's<br>a bunch of people collectively coming<br>together making decisions to<br>collectively produce some sort of<br>outcome<br>right and all we do as accountants is<br>we're telling the story of that process<br>of those actions and behaviors and the<br>decisions that are made and increasingly<br>it used to just be about the financials<br>and now with all of these different<br>reporting mechanisms coming in it's<br>about the social story the environmental<br>story and we're looking at it more<br>holistically um so i say accounting is<br>storytelling um and it also used to be<br>that you were telling the story looking<br>backwards like this is what has happened<br>whereas now you kind of also get to be<br>the author because you're partnering<br>with businesses clients depending on you<br>know what your positioning is to<br>actually help them work out what they're<br>going to do in the future as well so<br>i would say you absolutely don't need to<br>be good at numbers if if you look at<br>actually the people coming into the<br>profession now you don't even<br>necessarily need a business degree to<br>start with you can come from different<br>aspects and that's great when we think<br>about telling stories and we think about<br>holistic value creation we're thinking<br>about strategy and we're thinking about<br>the environment and people and social<br>capital and all these other things so we<br>need those different perspectives in the<br>room it's okay to have a background in<br>anthropology or music or engineering or<br>whatever it might be you can bring those<br>skill sets to accounting to make<br>yourself a good accountant um<br>and i i've worn lots of hats in my day<br>and there'll be hats that i wear in the<br>future that haven't even been designed<br>yet or made um but in a past life i was<br>a grad recruiter i actually designed a<br>graduate program for accounting students<br>um and so i've got two main things i<br>want to say about that real quick<br>because i could talk about this for days<br>um but when i was scoping that up i did<br>a lot of work in terms of what the skill<br>set of a future accountant looked like<br>because i wanted to future-proof my<br>grads to give them the skills that they<br>were going to need in the future and all<br>the professional bodies and all the big<br>four that there's so many white papers<br>out there so much research about what<br>the future accountant looks like<br>and what really does come through are<br>those soft skills those things that you<br>can't automate i can teach any of my<br>grads how to do debits and credits and<br>show them how to do a journal and i can<br>teach them a different erp system<br>whether it's oracle or staff whatever it<br>is easy done it's harder to teach than<br>critical thinking and problem solving<br>and empathy and the ability to build<br>trust and have those trusted<br>relationships to be able to provide<br>advice because that's essentially what<br>we do so i would say it's those soft<br>skills<br>um that are really really important as<br>opposed to the numbers um but also just<br>coming back to the other point some of<br>the grads i hired were music majors i<br>had one person who was 40 and she was an<br>interior designer and she realized that<br>she actually liked the business part of<br>interior design more than the decorating<br>part so she flipped careers became an<br>accountant<br>freaking phenomenal i had someone who<br>was a microbiologist who did his degree<br>in otago um used to do you know grow<br>diseases and petri dishes became an<br>accountant absolutely amazing in terms<br>of his data analytics skills and the<br>ability to tell a story with numbers um<br>so i would say yeah diverse backgrounds<br>diverse thinking we do a lot of research<br>now into neurodiversity and and what<br>that means in terms of accounting<br>too so that's kind of my message on that<br>anthony what are your thoughts on<br>hey lots of thoughts about all that<br>and<br>there's lots of questions we've got some<br>major challenges of<br>how we get accountants into the<br>profession<br>and what's the right way of doing that<br>um big picture and i haven't kept up<br>with what's been happening at secondary<br>school or even at university<br>i'm not sure how much that's changed<br>from my day but in my day there was a<br>thought that maybe you did accounting at<br>college that'd be an advantage then you<br>did a four-year degree at university and<br>that you got straight into a job that<br>sounds pretty good and then a career in<br>accounting for the next 20 or 30 years<br>um but that's all now changed<br>um i have been watching with interest<br>my 16 year old son who's been doing<br>accounting for the first year uh level<br>two<br>um it's interesting when he picks it up<br>he's very diligent um don't know where<br>he gets that from so understand<br>to understand level two he actually<br>picked up he<br>taught himself level one first because<br>he realized i can't understand this<br>without going back to level one because<br>is doing it by correspondence so he<br>effectively did both of them<br>um<br>but he was only doing it because he i<br>encouraged him obviously but he wasn't<br>really sure if he was interested in it<br>and<br>watching him go through it took a while<br>to click the debits and credits<br>i'm not really sure if it ever did click<br>if it was i think it's rope learning<br>memorizing some of it which doesn't work<br>when you get the exams<br>because i've we've done five of those<br>test exams over the last couple weeks so<br>you had the actual exam a couple days<br>ago<br>and a lot of tricks in there it's really<br>reading comprehension<br>and i was actually getting annoyed at<br>one question because i said if you put<br>five accountants in the room they'll all<br>come up with a different answer so how<br>you expect to do wellness<br>that got me a bit angry so<br>if anyone's involved in seeing those<br>questions<br>that really annoyed me there's five<br>answers here but when you go through the<br>marking guide there's only one answer<br>and you know my someone's excellent just<br>like i look at excellence dad it's like<br>honestly alex my son if you overthink it<br>you might get it wrong<br>so it's probably teaching him too much<br>i'm<br>going off all sorts of tangents but<br>the end result out of that which is a<br>bit alarming is<br>the course from what i follow just focus<br>on the account the reporting focus on<br>the debits and credits<br>he's really not sure if he wants to do<br>accounting in fact i'm pretty sure he<br>won't he said i've given it a go for a<br>year dad i'm not going to do it again<br>because you know<br>i'm really stuck on this one because i<br>absolutely absolutely agree you need<br>that grounding accounting doesn't make<br>sense about the debits and credits and<br>every day when i'm developing accounting<br>standards and it's all about words i am<br>going back to the division credits so<br>you can't escape that um but somehow to<br>attract these students we need to get<br>the broader vision the broader picture<br>about what reporting is<br>it can't just be about the bookkeeping<br>and maybe to be fair that was in the<br>course i just didn't<br>i've been following the exam and the<br>exam is just bookkeeping um maybe that<br>was an earlier part um but at the moment<br>yeah<br>they've lost them yeah he won't pick up<br>accounting he's going to do other things<br>he's interested in<br>picking up your comments it's really<br>interesting in my career when we had<br>graduates come through from the uk when<br>i was an auditor for 14 years<br>and it just amazed me when we get<br>auditors come through and it's like oh<br>what's your background what did you do<br>at university i said i did<br>a degree and a thesis in<br>astros or science or<br>biology or something else and okay did<br>you do accounting at school no did you<br>do accounting at university no<br>they pick it up later so it's a very<br>different model from new zealand<br>where we've got a<br>to be a ca you have to have a degree in<br>accountancy so i haven't got the answers<br>there but those people as you say um<br>fantastic accountants fantastic business<br>advisors<br>um so yeah some big questions there i'm<br>not sure um<br>in terms of<br>when people are going for jobs now what<br>are they going to be looking for<br>and let's write down a few details as i<br>was thinking about this morning um<br>future so the important skills will<br>continue to be an attention to detail<br>um we want accountants have this big<br>picture but i'm sorry i can't get away<br>from the detail and getting things right<br>rocks rights judgment uh ability to<br>approach this next one ability to<br>provide<br>apply professional judgment<br>that's huge and for me in the world of<br>accounting standards and standard<br>setting quite often the accounting<br>standards don't give you the answer um<br>that you want it doesn't give the answer<br>that directors want that users want<br>so there's this judgment required around<br>the technical answer and the practical<br>answer and they've banging to bang into<br>each other all the time so counters need<br>to find a solution between that between<br>the<br>practical<br>and the really technical answer<br>so that's that's not easy<br>again accounting standards i keep<br>banging on about it when i'm doing<br>lectures um in new zealand they're not<br>rules based<br>if you want rules based maybe go to the<br>us<br>they're they're much more rules based at<br>nasa for every single transaction<br>in new zealand uk canada australia many<br>other places around the world especially<br>anyone using ifrs it's principles based<br>and you need to apply judgment and you<br>will come up with different answers so<br>professional judgment huge<br>and the most important one in the future<br>from my perspective and what i'm seeing<br>will be i.t<br>a real competence in i.t and the future<br>of accounting will be big data<br>and data analytics and we're now to work<br>through all that uh the future of<br>accounting the future of reporting and<br>it's not too far off in the future and<br>there's pressure for it to happen now<br>is not<br>pdf version of financial statements<br>pages one to 50 or 100<br>that you print off and flip page by page<br>will be a digital version of financial<br>statements of an annual report<br>where the user will come in and they'll<br>have a dashboard and they can choose the<br>information they want uh what<br>information is important to them and<br>under what how they want to receive it<br>under different reports<br>there will be a world in the not too<br>distant future where you can push<br>different buttons um i want the<br>financial statements all on a cost basis<br>i want those financial statements or on<br>a fair value basis with everything<br>re-measured to fair value what is the<br>value now if i sold the business<br>because i saw it in every single exam<br>that alex did there was always a<br>question around doubtful debts and<br>applying a percentage there<br>which again annoy me because if you got<br>that wrong it flowed through the whole<br>thing<br>so<br>you're teaching you're teaching the kids<br>that they have to get it right and that<br>detail is really important yeah really<br>important but pretty harsh exam<br>it doesn't match the real world you got<br>computers and you got checks and but i<br>guess that's exams that's a long debate<br>should we still have exams where you<br>have to get it right on the date um but<br>sorry digital reporting you can push a<br>button and say okay what if the doubtful<br>dex is 10 percent what if it's 20<br>what if it's 50<br>what's going to happen to those<br>financial statements and you can push<br>that button<br>um you'll get to push a button i want<br>the financial statements on a prudent<br>basis or a conservative basis<br>optimistic basis that was we're looking<br>for<br>it's a bit like your kiwisaver scheme<br>how much risk you want to take around<br>the different schemes you pick with the<br>same thing with financial statements and<br>you'll get a completely different report<br>on what you want because we've got many<br>different users<br>so that's going to be a big future of<br>how we manage that from a digitization<br>and an i.t perspective and all the firms<br>will be looking for that<br>with micro support<br>thank you anthony<br>from your perspective as an employer bdo<br>so what what is bdo and some laverne is<br>looking for in their new grads yeah<br>that's a really good point um so i had a<br>bit of a chat with a couple of the<br>partners about uh<br>that is a thing this morning and uh they<br>also agreed that it's the communication<br>skills to be able to tell that story<br>about what the numbers mean as opposed<br>to your expense for this was the percent<br>of something else and no one really<br>cares about your<br>compliance accounts you have to send tax<br>return to the ird which is<br>sometimes a little bit depressing you<br>think i spent so many weeks it sets the<br>financial statements up and then the<br>client signs them within<br>me sending them to him but<br>that is<br>the job at times but it's that attention<br>to detail it's that communication<br>critical thinking are those sort of key<br>skills<br>that we<br>start um i suppose coming back to that<br>um<br>level two question i was talking with<br>one of the partners and he said his<br>daughter has done year 12 accounting<br>this year and she's decided she's not<br>going to take it<br>that's<br>quite sad and is that a reflection of<br>perhaps the way it's being taught or the<br>way it's being assessed i'm not sure but<br>uh<br>it's concerning for for us as employers<br>of future americans now i spent talking<br>about your point about being able to<br>customize reports we are doing a lot<br>more future focused work the um<br>covert 19 it really did throw a complete<br>spanner in the works for almost every<br>client that we look after<br>some clients have had record years<br>they've seen twice the revenue<br>really struggling we've got a lot of<br>work with cash flow forecasts and<br>modeling and looking at<br>other sources of funding and i suppose<br>being<br>using our advisory skills and our<br>knowledge<br>skills skills<br>we can calculate this with our computers<br>that does the hard work for us i think<br>the main skill is understanding<br>the divots and credits and losing them<br>at that you know we<br>at university we've struggled with we<br>haven't struggled with that same issue<br>is that i think<br>um perhaps we've gone too quickly into<br>that and we've lost them within week one<br>or two especially those and become<br>course so recently<br>we've been experimenting with a<br>different style so we now have two core<br>courses 100 level um and in that first<br>course we have really a potluck of<br>introductory accounting topics um<br>and where we expose them to what we um<br>believe is the core of accounting which<br>is this idea of accountability<br>um and stewardship and and advisory<br>whatever the case may be and so we<br>introduce them and expose them to all of<br>these topics and then they go into that<br>second<br>year course where the debits and credits<br>are there but they're sort of threaded<br>throughout the entire course rather than<br>a core you know four to five week<br>component of debits and credits where of<br>course they'll be overwhelmed and<br>perhaps a little bit<br>especially when we're telling them that<br>the stuff is automated you know so what<br>they really need to understand is the<br>the basics of it rather than how to<br>become technical experts in debits and<br>and credits so i can see that also being<br>applicable to eca perhaps but<br>that's but<br>unfortunately yeah<br>it's really hard because i have<br>different thoughts about it all the time<br>but what we hear from the yorta partners<br>over the last couple years<br>is that graduates are coming through and<br>they're banging their heads that don't<br>understand the debits and credits<br>uh so you can't escape it but it's it's<br>selling that broader vision around the<br>importance of reporting and what it's<br>seeking to achieve<br>it's sort of related to that point i was<br>talking with one of my old accounting<br>teachers from school a while ago and he<br>said that they no longer teach financial<br>statements at level three because of the<br>class of 30 he only had three kids sit<br>the exam that year so he said i'd rather<br>spend<br>that term teaching the other two papers<br>and getting more of the kids with<br>excellence grades do you think that's<br>sort of having a flow on effect to<br>knowledge and the way those exams<br>written i got under the last before they<br>realigned them<br>and uh well it was what four or five<br>externals on that day in november as<br>opposed to the three<br>or two papers that they do now<br>does that sort of flow on effects to<br>what you're talking about<br>we teach with the idea that we don't<br>have accounting um students with any<br>accounting<br>um knowledge whatsoever so we're sort of<br>there to reteach them i guess which<br>again that was a bigger picture decision<br>that was made um so i i wouldn't say<br>this<br>we do have however what i have seen at<br>universities those students that come in<br>expecting to be taught accounting in one<br>particular way so they have perhaps<br>fallen in love with their divots and<br>credits and their financial statements<br>and they come in and i'm telling them<br>about environmental and social<br>accounting they're like this isn't what<br>i signed up for<br>um but then what we have seen is those<br>students who perhaps had that<br>misconception at high school<br>she decided that they wouldn't do<br>accounting and decided that that was it<br>for them they come in because they want<br>to do commerce they want to major in<br>commerce they have to do this aggie 130<br>course and all of a sudden they're being<br>introduced to a different<br>conceptualization of accounting and then<br>they fall in love with it at that point<br>so that yeah that's what we've seen<br>really yeah<br>thank you to the panelists i guess we'll<br>open it up now to the<br>a business executive in this day<br>he's now seemingly retired but he gets a<br>lot of contract work from banks to look<br>into ferns which have had a bank loan<br>and struggling he has to do a viability<br>study and find a restructuring firm but<br>this is the comment he makes that is<br>that he finds<br>do you think this is a big problem new<br>zealand boards of governments who are<br>out of touch<br>and it's not represented by us<br>in other nations and what can be done<br>about it<br>pretty general question thanks very much<br>you would like to<br>start um i'll give to start with others<br>are thinking but i think i'll just be<br>reiterating the issue<br>um that we have um has been commented to<br>me about the<br>the dropping financial literacy<br>across new zealand<br>and um not just at the the companies and<br>the director level but also at the<br>charity level there's thousands of<br>charities in new zealand for volunteers<br>uh the literacy is is not there at that<br>level also<br>um i was extremely pleased because it<br>didn't exist in my day when my youngest<br>son was just started college and they<br>got the topic financial literacy<br>as a first level course which i think is<br>fantastic<br>and it's giving that what i see is quite<br>broad<br>and teaching things that we assume kids<br>know but many don't<br>some adults don't know it so i thought<br>that was extremely pleasing but yes<br>i agree that it is a<br>it's something that we see<br>to varying degrees a lot of our clients<br>i've got one client who runs an awesome<br>business his clients love him he<br>produces great work but his cash flow is<br>terrible because he doesn't like doing<br>the book work and actually sending out<br>invoices to clients or even worse when<br>the client doesn't pay it on time he<br>doesn't actually want to pick up the<br>phone and have that conversation hey joe<br>you owe me five thousand dollars<br>and those conversations are always<br>difficult we have them ourselves with<br>some of our clients<br>but<br>one of the things that we do at video in<br>our films we've had a lot of uh virtual<br>receiver class where we can provide<br>some high level skills and insights that<br>we've got<br>access to clients clients wouldn't<br>necessarily have the means to employ a<br>full-time cfo at their business we have<br>clients where one of the partners in our<br>firm is an independent director on their<br>company board and goes to every board<br>meeting they have to provide some wider<br>governance advice<br>one of the partners that i<br>or has been a<br>director of a large multinational<br>construction company for the last 10<br>years she's just finished that term and<br>that's been really interesting just the<br>conversations that we've had the things<br>that she's gained out of that and she's<br>able to apply to other clients but i<br>agree not having<br>that sort of<br>wider picture understanding at a<br>governance level is an issue for a lot<br>of clients and most of our clients that<br>i look after are in that sme space so we<br>do see that quite a bit and<br>we try to encourage a lot of our clients<br>to actually come and have a meeting with<br>us each year getting away from that<br>compliance work of we send the shoe box<br>of receipts to the accountant at the end<br>of the year and he gives me this letter<br>that says i owe the ird this much money<br>on the 7th of may and how much profit<br>i've got to pay on the 28th of august<br>and get it to more of an advisory<br>relationship where we can help our<br>clients grow their businesses and<br>i think also too you're seeing changes<br>in board composition as we start moving<br>towards these ideas about diversity and<br>inclusion and as boards need to start<br>thinking more holistically and we're<br>going to keep coming back to this word<br>holistically around social environmental<br>issues and everything else you're going<br>to see a greater number or greater<br>diversity of voices at the table<br>and so not everybody has to be<br>financially literate to be in that room<br>um but you still need those financially<br>literate voices<br>um very important and i think that's one<br>of the differences if you look at<br>successful boards you'll often see<br>professionals represented on those<br>boards um usually lawyers and in<br>chartered accountants and there's a<br>reason that the professionals get a foot<br>in the door because being a member of a<br>profession has a certain level of<br>professional development and ethics and<br>trust associated with it that you can<br>actually sort of mandate that the<br>decisions and the insights that are<br>generating at that board level are going<br>to be robust um and they're just<br>thinking about sort of the future of<br>boards um so it charted accountants with<br>a professional body here that represents<br>chartered accountants so professionally<br>qualified chartered accountants in<br>australia and new zealand<br>and i'm on the ca program teaching team<br>so to be a professionally qualified<br>chartered accountant you do your degree<br>and then you enter the profession you've<br>got to do some mental practical<br>experiences our panelists know<br>and then you also have to do a series of<br>professional exams it's kind of like you<br>know when you watch american movies and<br>have to pass the bar to become a lawyer<br>and we've recently just changed our<br>entire ca program um and<br>we've done that with the future of the<br>profession in mind<br>if i look at one of the courses i teach<br>now which is called risk and technology<br>we're teaching candidates now how to<br>look at integrated risk management so<br>not just internal controls like<br>accountants are really comfortable with<br>thinking about risk but holistic risks<br>strategic risks reputational<br>environmental human risks we're teaching<br>them how to<br>actually give advice on risk collateral<br>how to actually guide businesses to make<br>those decisions how to write board<br>papers how to think about it from a<br>governance level and also how to<br>integrate that with emerging<br>technologies and intelligent process<br>automation and robotic process<br>automation and how those things actually<br>all integrate together so they're<br>starting at that very basic level to<br>already understand that sort of broader<br>risk framework and that brought in a<br>governance framework that they're going<br>to need when in their professional<br>careers they're eventually going to kind<br>of make it to those directorship um sort<br>of board level um<br>positions as well<br>the answer is that everybody should have<br>an accountant<br>absolutely every board should have a<br>another<br>hello thank you for uh<br>wonderful discussion today<br>um<br>we teach you guys uh and accounting i've<br>been wearing girls<br>here<br>um and it's a shame actually that um<br>that we are losing level one because i<br>our students are really delving into<br>just exactly what cinderella said<br>um we're looking at any reports but you<br>know they're now looking at<br>sustainability and looking at<br>um ethics um of the board of directors<br>and<br>we've got the numbers but there's the<br>story behind it as well um<br>so one of the problems that we're facing<br>though as you correctly have said um<br>there's this assumption of assertion<br>that<br>accounting is dying and it's uh the<br>computers are taking over<br>and all that and we're getting this<br>obviously not from our department um but<br>we're getting it from our career<br>surprises and others around the stores<br>science department for example so just<br>like uh<br>the<br>recruiting students to do accounting um<br>we'd like a buzzword so what we've heard<br>a lot about what's accounting in the<br>future and everything else but is there<br>something<br>a word or a phrase or something we could<br>use<br>that we could catch these germans and<br>say hey this is really what accounting<br>is about<br>um<br>okay i really want to answer this<br>question<br>um my word is entrepreneurship<br>if you look at students these days<br>what's really driving them that<br>entrepreneurial in nature more than<br>we've ever seen in any prior generations<br>and one of the things that you can look<br>at is the rise of stem stem's a dirty<br>word for me i hate it because everyone's<br>doing stem instead of accounting<br>but it's because if you talk to them<br>they want to do all this really cool<br>technological stuff but then if you ask<br>them what they want to do with it they<br>want to design an app they want to<br>develop some sort of robot and then they<br>want to commercialize it they want to<br>make a business out of it they want to<br>be their own boss and all the literature<br>backs it up that there's a key driver<br>going forward of the current students<br>that you have you just look at the rise<br>of young enterprise<br>they love entrepreneurship they love<br>designing and creating things and being<br>innovative and they want to<br>commercialize that so i would say<br>entrepreneurship<br>because accounting is the language of<br>business it's an old mantra that we've<br>said before and it's old and cliche<br>because it's true right and so i know a<br>lot of people who have studied stem and<br>that's the industry that they want to<br>enter but increasingly they're picking<br>up accounting because they need that<br>financial literacy they need that<br>business acumen to pair that business<br>knowledge and commercialization with the<br>actual stem stuff so i would say<br>entrepreneurship<br>yeah plus also if i could just add to<br>that if you want to get them into<br>accounting you don't study accounting<br>just to be an accountant you know and i<br>think that's important too i mean<br>i hate debits and credits and i hate<br>financial standards i was never born to<br>be like a typical debits and credits<br>accountant i'm a strategic management<br>accountant i used to go into businesses<br>and consult them about their strategy<br>and their performance measurement you<br>talk about the workforce planning i mean<br>there was some standard stuff in there<br>too not going to lie um you do budgeting<br>and forecasting and helping with product<br>mix and relationships with suppliers and<br>accounting is so much more than debits<br>and credits but you don't even need to<br>be an accountant i mean like i said i've<br>designed a graduate program i've written<br>briefing papers for the minister of<br>finance um<br>i've worked in capability development<br>i've been an accounting academic i'm now<br>still kind of an accounting educator<br>there's so much that you can do<br>with accounting as well that's not just<br>being an accountant so i think it's also<br>selling the value proposition of that<br>skill set and the capabilities that<br>accounting gives people not just<br>professionally but personally as well<br>we'll let someone else talk<br>yeah that's um i think that's perfect i<br>think the key message is that accounting<br>you can make that into whatever role you<br>want it to be<br>and there's so many different types of<br>accountants and again that's<br>yeah i really want to come up with a new<br>word for it because it doesn't capture<br>the breadth of the different types of<br>yeah<br>the research said no um<br>because we hate the word count an<br>accountant right because it infers<br>everything about number crunching and<br>everything but all the research that we<br>did showed the word accountant is imbued<br>with that idea about ethics and trust<br>and everything else and so if you flip<br>that narrative around in that word you<br>lose that inherent meaning so it's more<br>about reframing what an accountant does<br>rather than renaming it um yeah<br>um so what i would be saying to students<br>if they love the debits and credits and<br>there's a few of us around if they love<br>the accounting standards<br>if they love the detail if they love the<br>financial reporting there's definitely a<br>future still for that um the chair of<br>the isp i love that the phrase he used a<br>couple weeks ago financial reporting<br>will remain the backbone of external<br>reporting<br>takeaway financial reporting and<br>everything else falls apart so if you<br>really love that aspect of it there's a<br>role there<br>if you love the idea of being a<br>financial controller at organization and<br>looking after the organization making<br>sure they're getting the tax and the gst<br>and all the compliance right<br>definitely a role there<br>if you like the idea of changing the<br>world and getting into climate and esg<br>there's a role there there's so many<br>different things you can make it in to<br>be<br>um the other word i was thinking of and<br>this shows a little bit about my<br>personality it's about the money<br>as one word i could<br>one word i could use is guarantee at the<br>moment<br>a student coming out as an accountant at<br>the moment is just about guaranteed<br>to get a job<br>there's about 200 i think now 250 um<br>coming through from cairns 250 shortage<br>of auditors<br>um the profession<br>at the moment saying we can't get them<br>um some of that is a big part of that is<br>the border closure<br>another part of that is the graduate<br>simply not coming through<br>so there's a massive demand simply for<br>the auditors<br>auditor again another profession you<br>could get into<br>um<br>it's not what it used to be when i used<br>to sit here<br>um as a student order if you want to be<br>awesome that was number one that was<br>exciting you wanted to be an auditor um<br>i think not not anymore<br>is the feeling out there so that needs<br>to be reselled<br>yeah auditing's a scary profession now<br>um but hugely rewarding<br>so do you like that technical standards<br>that<br>area there's definitely the business<br>advisory which is more my line of work<br>actually getting down sitting down with<br>sme owners and working out how<br>to<br>we you know our corporate you know sort<br>of tagline is people helping people<br>achieve their dreams and that as corny<br>as that may sound in this sort of<br>situation that is one of the things that<br>an advisory we are able to do yes so the<br>joke about what you want i want<br>the boat i want the batch and i want the<br>bends just<br>as sort of one that's been thrown around<br>but as far as students if we could hire<br>10 grads for our team next year we would<br>but<br>there really is a shortage of skilled<br>staff we<br>our firms grown 30 since i've started a<br>bdo in wellington it really is a growth<br>profession it's not this dying art that<br>if i if i could add an answer to it so<br>what i tell my students and i guess<br>maybe it's one subset of what an<br>accountant could be because i tell them<br>that they can be social change agents<br>you know they can help inform democratic<br>society because information is powerful<br>so sometimes catches their attention<br>um so i think we have a real opportunity<br>to really really get them excited so<br>that's fantastic to hear yeah<br>okay<br>i'm going to keep my thank you at the<br>end to about a minute so because i<br>really wanted this to continue and<br>there's been a last-minute flurry of<br>questions come through so we will<br>download those and share them with the<br>panelists some questions for for cans<br>around kind of um how to partner perhaps<br>with schools and universities around<br>kind of a marketing campaign about what<br>it is to be an accountant there's also a<br>really good question there about um we<br>talked about school visits to the<br>university before but actually could<br>accounting firms host schools and school<br>classes who could come and see what it's<br>like i'm not sure how exciting an open<br>plan office is but it gives you a bit of<br>an insight and as part of our high<br>school visits we do often bring in<br>external speakers as well so that's<br>another great way to do it come into the<br>university we'll pair you with a um one<br>of our sort of um lectures i almost have<br>experts there but after ben's<br>presentation right at the beginning i've<br>been really cautious about how i use<br>that term now um but also we often do<br>bring in external speakers as well so<br>it's another opportunity if you'd like<br>to hear a speaker from treasury or the<br>reserve bank we've got really good links<br>there or one of the one of our<br>accounting partners as well another<br>opportunity hey on behalf of the<br>wellington school of business and<br>government i would like to thank<br>cinderella for sharing today and coming<br>up with really thought-provoking<br>questions and daniel rebecca and anthony<br>for putting their thinking caps on and<br>provoking us in a few ways around kind<br>of what it means to be teachers of<br>accounting and and other aspects so<br>thank you very much around your applause<br>for us panel speakers<br>and with that i'd like to say thank you<br>to everyone who's joined us either here<br>in wellington or online it's been really<br>great to have you involved a little bit<br>different but we're all trying new ways<br>of engaging and networking and<br>professional development we have<br>recorded today's session so we'll be<br>doing some chopping up and and putting<br>that up and we'll get those resources<br>out to you along with as we usually do<br>follow up with slides and and some links<br>in fact actually we were just thinking<br>rachel and i that there's we had a<br>really good panel on governance here at<br>the university very recently that was<br>talking about some of those what it<br>means to kind of heat sort of a diverse<br>governance space so we could put a link<br>to that and we've also got some of those<br>resources we've talked about during the<br>day from cairns but also our principals<br>responsible management education um<br>report as well<br>so i'd like to say thank you to rachel<br>and her team for putting this on and<br>it's been as i say really nice to engage<br>a little bit differently with you we<br>hope to see some of you when we get back<br>on the road hopefully next year we<br>usually head out to auckland and<br>christchurch but we i think we will keep<br>some kind of online opportunity probably<br>at the wellington event because it's<br>been really great to actually engage<br>with some of those uh schools that can't<br>always make it to the major centers for<br>these pd opportunities<br>so those in the room and have the<br>opportunity to join us upstairs for a<br>tasty lunch those who are joining us<br>online<br>thank you very much for being with us<br>and we will hopefully see you next year<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
