wellbeing literature in psychology, economics and sociology: (i) which personal and societal factors contribute to SWB, and (ii) how SWB affects other outcomes for an individual and for society.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>welcome welcome welcome to our final<br>webinar in the 2021<br>funded chair series on the sustainable<br>development groups<br>many of you<br>i have seen another webinar so it's<br>great to see you join also for this one<br>and it is<br>hopefully something that has been<br>informative in advancing our<br>understanding of the sustainable<br>development goals i should point out<br>that arthur's<br>seminar was initially planned<br>for august was then wiped out by our<br>second round of covert alert level<br>changes<br>back then it was<br>designed as a<br>as a<br>seminar in hybrid function now we're<br>going to a webinar<br>to make sure that well-being is well<br>looked after and protected<br>so<br>thank you for joining<br>the topic of today's<br>presentation is well-being and the sdgs<br>so it's quite a quite a broad topic not<br>as specific as some of the other ones<br>but i think that's going to be one of<br>the<br>the really interesting aspects of this<br>professor<br>is joining us today as the<br>speaker he is the chair in well-being<br>and public policy<br>at wellington school of business and<br>government and he is also a senior<br>fellow at<br>motu<br>economic and public policy research<br>he also had a live previously as a<br>former chairman and chief executive<br>the chief exorbitant economist sorry of<br>the reserve bank<br>and it's great to have him here today<br>and before<br>i hand over<br>to arthur i would like to<br>remind everybody that this is a<br>a series that has now been running<br>since earlier in the year and this is in<br>fact truly the final one for 2021. in<br>2022 we're hoping to have something<br>similar but with a slightly different<br>angle but again focused on the sdgs<br>so as i<br>am about to hand over i wish to just<br>contextualize briefly that this<br>presentation will be about sdg3 good<br>health and well-being<br>um but from a much broader perspective<br>and subjective aspects of well-being so<br>on that note<br>i hand over to professor arthur grimes<br>thank you arthur<br>thanks very much christian uh<br>to do that one<br>here we go hopefully you can all see<br>that fine yep great<br>so uh thank you very much for that<br>introduction and it's great to be able<br>to participate uh in this series<br>um we started with an introduction about<br>covert and lockdowns and i'll finish on<br>so as christian said this uh the area of<br>the sdgs that i work in is most closely<br>related to<br>sdg3 good health and well-being which is<br>obviously one of 17<br>sustainable development goals<br>this particular one has 13 targets 26<br>indicators and if we look at those most<br>of those indicators focus on physical<br>health<br>and actually none of them<br>zero<br>focus on subjective well-being or in<br>other words on how people's rate people<br>people rate their own well-being<br>which is really quite an anachronism in<br>this um sort of<br>modern<br>day when we look at well-being<br>across the world that the sdgs have no<br>mention of how people rate their own<br>life<br>so<br>i'm going to try and expand on what the<br>sdgs<br>the sdg approach<br>so what are some of the other approaches<br>other than the sdgs that uh take a<br>broader<br>approach to well-being<br>well we can go back uh go back many<br>years perhaps 50 or 60 years in terms of<br>academic work on this but i'm going to<br>start with the stiglet sen fatousi<br>report which president sarkozy of france<br>commissioned<br>back in 2008<br>measures that could replace gdp or<br>supplement gdp to determine how well a<br>country is doing and one of their<br>conclusions was too<br>that people<br>countries should measure both objective<br>and subjective well-being so that goes<br>back to the<br>at around the same time in fact slightly<br>earlier<br>we had another uh prominent uh<br>politician in that case uh david cameron<br>who was then prime minister of the uk<br>uh saying<br>wealth is about so much more than pounds<br>or euros or dollars can ever measure<br>it's time we admitted that there's more<br>to life than money and it's time we<br>focus not just on gdp<br>obviously gross domestic product but on<br>gwb general well-being<br>and i'll put these two things up to<br>start with because it's interesting that<br>here we have a centre-right prime<br>minister of the uk david cameron and a<br>center-right president of france<br>president sarkozy both championing uh<br>well-being as the main target for policy<br>and for those of us in new zealand where<br>we see well being often being thought<br>about and talked about as from a<br>center-left government perspective<br>uh what this uh tells us is that this is<br>not particularly a centre-left uh<br>approach this is actually goes right<br>across uh across the board in terms of<br>political um<br>sort of agendas uh around the world<br>uh but if you go back to the center left<br>i suppose we can also go back a lot<br>further bobby kennedy and a very famous<br>speech he gave<br>to<br>the university of kansas in 1968 shortly<br>before he was assassinated<br>um<br>had a very long speech but part of it he<br>talked also about even if we can act to<br>erase material poverty there is another<br>greater task<br>it is to confront the poverty of<br>satisfaction of purpose and dignity that<br>afflict us all<br>and what he was getting at in that talk<br>was another aspect of well-being which<br>is what aristotle called eudaimonia<br>which is we can roughly think of as your<br>purpose in life do you have control over<br>your life do you think you're living a<br>good life<br>and this is a very strong<br>the held aspect of well-being amongst<br>philosophers<br>it's not one that i'm going to deal with<br>much today and it lies pretty much<br>beyond the<br>ambit of governments i think<br>but it's uh it's an interesting area for<br>personal well-being as well whether<br>people have a strong purpose in life<br>going back at two and a half thousand<br>years we have confucius uh very nicely<br>summarizing what i think governments<br>should be trying to do he says there is<br>good government when those who are near<br>are made happy<br>and when those who are afar are<br>attracted<br>uh so in other words we can tell whether<br>a government is doing well by whether<br>people want to move to that place<br>whether it's local government or central<br>and also whether people want to leave<br>there so we see many people wanting to<br>come to new zealand and a lot of people<br>wanting to leave syria for instance it's<br>quite a good measure interestingly<br>confucius was writing at about the same<br>time as the great<br>great<br>greek philosophers were writing on the<br>same subject on the other side of the<br>world<br>so what about in new zealand we all know<br>about new zealand's<br>as a quote<br>news of new zealand's proposed<br>well-being budget took the davos world<br>economic forum by storm earlier this<br>year<br>but the question when we look at these<br>sorts of approaches to policy is what do<br>we mean by well-being so i'm going to<br>talk about that<br>i'll talk about very briefly about two<br>different well-being policy approaches<br>that are<br>used around the world i'll talk briefly<br>about some other countries experiences<br>in terms of running policies<br>targeted at well-being and then i'll<br>summarize some of my own research in<br>this area to give you a flavor of how we<br>can use well-being research to answer<br>various policy issues<br>so what do we mean by well-being<br>uh<br>well-being is a term now that is used<br>but actually it's<br>almost exactly the same as the term<br>welfare that we have used for the last<br>100 years or so at least in the<br>economics literature so if we look at<br>the oxford english dictionary the<br>shorter opposite english dictionary says<br>well-being is the state of being or<br>doing well in life<br>a happy healthy or prosperous condition<br>or simply welfare<br>and when it comes to defined welfare it<br>says good fortune happiness or<br>well-being<br>so<br>what we now say is uh a well-being<br>agenda is very much what we've talked<br>about as a welfare agenda in the past<br>but not in this in the<br>sense that the americans use welfare as<br>being on a benefit<br>it's talking about people's overall<br>welfare and in fact the founder of<br>uh<br>um<br>economics in this area pegu uh talked<br>talked about total welfare as opposed to<br>economic welfare you thought about<br>economic welfare as being<br>things within the measuring rod of money<br>and total welfare is including all<br>aspects of what<br>improves our life in other words what we<br>i co-chair the world well-being<br>panel with three others<br>and uh our<br>raison d'etre in this panel is saying<br>that the world well-being panel is about<br>the promotion of well-being as the<br>ultimate purpose of all major decision<br>makers particularly government<br>and interestingly on this panel we have<br>about 50 experts from around the world<br>and they're not just economists they<br>have economists psychologists<br>sociologists philosophers<br>and from a wide range of countries with<br>different developmental<br>status so this is an area that's got<br>worldwide appeal now it's not just a<br>particularly um local sort of new<br>zealand angle<br>so what are the two main approaches to<br>well-being policy that have been used by<br>policymakers<br>in recent decades<br>the first one we can attribute to<br>amateur sen<br>which is the capabilities approach and<br>also martha nussbaum is another<br>prominent uh proponent of this approach<br>and sen argues that<br>policies should be designed to improve<br>people's capabilities<br>or their opportunities or freedom to<br>pursue well-being<br>in a typical economist sort of jargon<br>we'd have called that our making sure<br>that we have the widest opportunity set<br>that we can have in other words we have<br>the opportunity to pursue a whole lot of<br>different things with our lives uh and<br>then sin would argue that it's not up to<br>government then to<br>choose from amongst those what the<br>government's role is is to make sure<br>that we have the opportunity or the<br>capability to pursue different avenues<br>in our life<br>and then to leave it at that<br>one issue with this approach is uh who<br>chooses which capabilities should be<br>targeted<br>sin is silent on that and deliberately<br>so nussbaum is more paternalistic in<br>that she names which capabilities should<br>be<br>should be adopted<br>um and in fact if one wants to<br>operationalize this approach one has to<br>basically come down with a list of<br>capabilities that governments and others<br>should<br>one related approach to the capabilities<br>approach is the multi-dimensional<br>poverty approach which sets thresholds<br>below which we don't want anyone to fall<br>across a whole range of different areas<br>and that's in many ways that's what the<br>sdgs do they set a<br>set of sort of basic thresholds above<br>which we each hope that each country's<br>individual citizens can can rise above i<br>think the capabilities approach is very<br>much along the lines of the old debate<br>uh between equality of opportunity and<br>equality of outcomes no one ever<br>believed in typically inequality of<br>outcomes but many people especially on<br>the libertarian sort of end of the<br>spectrum argue that really the<br>government's role is to emphasize<br>equality of opportunity<br>which essentially is equality of<br>capabilities from which then people can<br>choose to<br>do whatever they wish after that<br>the other main approach to policy<br>on well-being these days is the<br>subjective well-being approach which is<br>a modern manifestation of utilitarianism<br>philosophy<br>going back to bentham and mill and<br>others<br>and here the idea is that you design<br>policies to maximize people's evaluative<br>subjective well-being<br>and a typical evaluative subjective<br>well-being question is when we ask<br>people in<br>surveys all things considered how<br>satisfied are you with your life as a<br>whole these days<br>and there are other variants of this<br>one known as the kantral ladder is<br>slightly more complex asked in the<br>gallup poll across 150 countries<br>the question i've just used there is<br>used in the world values survey it's<br>used in most general social surveys by<br>stats agencies around the world<br>including new zealand<br>and there are many economists who have<br>adopted this approach dick eastland at<br>the bottom there has been writing on<br>this for the last 50 years or so since<br>1974. carol graham uh there is a strong<br>proponent<br>richard loud professor leott or lord<br>loud in the uk<br>jeffrey sachs<br>many many others uh people who have john<br>hellywood on canada so this is an<br>approach that's used<br>by many economists also sociologists<br>and to some extent by<br>psychologists such as eddina who<br>actually just died earlier this year<br>it's now used in what we call cost<br>well-being analysis which is a extension<br>of cost-benefit analysis where we<br>measure<br>benefits according to how different<br>policies contribute to people's<br>subjective well-being this is now at the<br>heart of some<br>policy approaches around the world<br>just a brief history on that<br>as i say it's based on classical<br>utilitarianism jeremy bentham talked<br>about targeting the greatest happiness<br>of the greatest number and i think it's<br>important to actually<br>think about what that has led to over<br>the last<br>200 to 300 years<br>with bentham's utilitarian approach of<br>maximizing happiness of the greatest<br>number was it was a strong<br>democratization<br>agenda he said uh no person just to be<br>to count more than another in other<br>words he was in 1780 when he was writing<br>he argued that you know the pawpaw was<br>just as important as the aristocrat<br>and we should put as much weight on the<br>pulpit as the aristocrat<br>it led to calls for equal rights for<br>women because all people should be<br>counted the same<br>equal rights for homosexuals this is<br>back in 1780<br>equal rights for non-believers and also<br>rights for animals<br>and modern philosophers have taken this<br>approach in terms of arguing for the<br>rights of animals<br>around the same time mary wollstonecraft<br>used it to<br>argue for the rights of women john<br>stuart mills shortly afterwards also<br>argued that a moral agent should choose<br>the action that maximizes the total<br>happiness in the world and also wrote of<br>course about the rights of women so this<br>has got a very very strong<br>background to it in terms of<br>arguing to make people's lives better<br>and making all people's lives better<br>not just those in the you know top the<br>aristocracy<br>different countries have taken different<br>approaches when it comes to well-being<br>policy agendas<br>uh perhaps the first explicit one<br>was bhutan<br>with its gross national happiness<br>that started in 1972<br>and their approach is very much like the<br>uh sdgs it's basically sets a whole set<br>of thresholds<br>which they try and get their<br>citizens above<br>and rather than thinking about total<br>happiness in fact it's it's a misnomer<br>in bhutan the gross national happiness<br>it's really a multi-dimensional poverty<br>approach where they say we're trying to<br>get people above these thresholds in<br>terms of their um their housing or their<br>education or their health<br>or also their spirituality in bhutan's<br>case<br>unfortunately since 1972 it's actually a<br>country that has made few tangible<br>improvements<br>and it's one of the less happy countries<br>in the world when you measure<br>overall<br>satisfaction with life so it hasn't been<br>a particularly<br>um<br>effective approach<br>australia started a well-being agenda<br>back in 2004 the australian treasury had<br>the australian treasury uh well-being<br>framework uh many years before new<br>zealand's treasury embarked on the same<br>same idea<br>but unfortunately it was scrapped<br>and the reason it was scrapped under<br>about five years ago<br>was that they couldn't find a way to<br>implement it in a way that was uh<br>satisfactory to help prioritize policies<br>uh they<br>had a<br>similar<br>approach to the new zealand treasury<br>a mixture between the capabilities and<br>utilitarian approaches<br>but it wasn't found useful for for<br>policy purposes and so it was scrapped<br>france again beat new zealand to the<br>game in 2015 passing a law<br>where the government had to<br>specify certain broad<br>policies and targets in terms of a<br>number of different measures of<br>well-being but it very quickly went into<br>abeyance when governments found that it<br>was<br>quite difficult to justify their<br>policies uh that they wanted to do<br>against their targets for for well-being<br>so they actually basically just ignore<br>it even though it's still in the law in<br>france<br>wales at the same time introduced the<br>future wales act<br>which targets well-being again well<br>before new zealand did the same thing<br>and the one good thing about the welsh<br>approach which is still<br>in place<br>is that it applies to all public<br>organizations in wales<br>who have to talk about how their<br>policies are going to improve the<br>well-being of the populace and also they<br>have to show how it will improve the<br>well-being in the future as well hence<br>the future of wales act and the nice<br>thing about the welsh one is that their<br>auditor general uh has the power to<br>uh audit whether public agencies are<br>actually meeting their well-being<br>agendas that they've put out and then<br>there is a<br>future a person who stands in the place<br>of future generations who has the same<br>auditing function to think about<br>policies from the perspective of the<br>future generation<br>so it has a stronger accountability<br>framework than other frameworks have<br>done much stronger than new zealand's<br>one<br>the united arab emirates is interesting<br>uh it has a framework that's very much<br>based around the cost well-being<br>analysis agenda uh which is the you know<br>where cost benefit analysis has been<br>extended to include explicit subjective<br>well-being measures<br>it's the most uh elegantly crafted<br>policy uh agenda policy framework of any<br>country<br>but it's uh oddly sits in a country with<br>horrific human rights uh and only 15<br>percent of people are citizens and the<br>the framework applies only to citizens<br>so the other 85 percent of people are<br>left out<br>and if people disagree with the<br>government they can be jailed or<br>executed or uh kidnapped or whatever so<br>it's a rather odd uh situation of a very<br>elegant framework in a horrific country<br>in new zealand some years after all of<br>these ones we introduced<br>the living standards framework with<br>treasury<br>which is a dashboard approach of<br>indicators<br>modeled on the better life index of the<br>oecd it's actually just been updated<br>uh in<br>the last month<br>um but still as a dashboard approach<br>where there's a whole lot of indicators<br>of a whole bunch of domains housing<br>health education<br>uh<br>social civic engagement and all sorts of<br>other things<br>um and<br>like most of these other approaches um<br>the the earlier approaches uh being a<br>dashboard is no<br>element in it which helps governments to<br>prioritize policies<br>as a result it's not very useful in my<br>view as a<br>guide to<br>implementing policy for well-being<br>purposes<br>because it's just a bunch of indicators<br>of a whole lot of things 60 or 80<br>indicators or however many you want<br>how do you actually choose between them<br>and choose policies on the back of that<br>interestingly the new zealand treasury<br>does have<br>seabacks which is the cost benefit<br>analysis<br>model<br>and this now has incorporated<br>elements of the uk's green book which is<br>the uk treasury's<br>approach to cost benefit analysis which<br>explicitly includes cost well-being<br>analysis now<br>so both the new zealand approach and the<br>the uk treasury approach<br>to cost-benefit analysis now explicitly<br>incorporate subjective well-being<br>and so much more the foundation of<br>well-being policy analysis then is the<br>living standards framework the standards<br>framework is really a red herring uh and<br>it's the sea backs where we should be<br>looking to later on<br>um<br>somebody's uh sorry we've got somebody's<br>unmuted there we go<br>so it's the sea backs that we should be<br>looking to<br>for a guide to well-being policy<br>analysis in new zealand rather than the<br>living standards framework<br>so how can we apply um<br>well-being<br>in our research especially subjective<br>well-being and i'll just give you a<br>smorgasbord very very quick smorgasbord<br>of some of my uh recent research most of<br>it's with students or research<br>assistants uh just to give you an idea<br>how we can actually implement some of<br>these ideas as to help guide policy<br>so i just supervised a student a year or<br>so ago leah haynes a master of public<br>policy student has won the prize for the<br>top master public policy student<br>and the paper that we<br>developed out of her<br>work<br>looks at<br>how we can use a modified version of the<br>treasury's living standards framework<br>to<br>help guide policy and one of the things<br>with living standards framework is i<br>said it's a dashboard which includes<br>housing health education and a whole<br>bunch of things it also includes<br>subjective well-being as one of its<br>uh components of the dashboard<br>and what we did was to say well let's<br>put uh living the subjective well-being<br>how we you know rate our lives overall<br>uh at the top of a hierarchy and put the<br>other uh domains of the living standards<br>framework as contributors to that so<br>your housing contributes to your overall<br>well-being your education contributes to<br>your overall well-being your health does<br>as well etc and then we said well if we<br>do that and we use uh data covering the<br>population from the general social<br>survey<br>what is it that matters most to a<br>particular population group and in this<br>case it was mothers and children who are<br>in material hardship<br>and interestingly there we found that<br>aspects such as such as housing was<br>probably the most important uh<br>contributor to subjective well-being as<br>well as of course<br>material standard of living as well<br>but also things like safety<br>and some other aspects<br>and one of the nice things about this<br>paper<br>and it was really leah's concentration<br>here was bringing a gendered perspective<br>into it to show that what matters for<br>mothers with dependent children who are<br>a material hardship is quite different<br>to what matters for say males in general<br>and<br>for instance employment is particularly<br>important for males when it comes to the<br>subjective well-being but if you're a<br>mother with dependent children and<br>you're a material hardship employment is<br>is not overall<br>a contributor to improving your<br>well-being uh when you're busy you know<br>trying to look after the children as<br>well um that's after controlling for<br>income though<br>so it's a very important uh contribution<br>i think in in that<br>way one of the other things that we have<br>looked at with another form of student<br>tom carver is even if we look at<br>material well-being what sort of<br>measures should we look at and here what<br>we<br>looked at is to go back to an idea that<br>economists have long had to use<br>permanent income rather than current<br>income as a measure of material<br>well-being and a measure of permanent<br>income is actually how much you consume<br>because that's going to be based on how<br>much you wealth you've got and how much<br>income you've got over your lifetime and<br>it turns out that consumption is a much<br>better measure of material uh well-being<br>than is income and so we should we<br>shouldn't be looking at things like gdp<br>uh per capita we should be looking more<br>at consumption-based measures even if<br>we're looking at material income<br>and when we do look at consumption<br>some work i did with a former victoria<br>graduate sean highland<br>who was a research assistant with me and<br>an intern with me<br>is to uh show that when we compare<br>consumption living standards across<br>countries uh new zealand actually does<br>very very well much much better than we<br>do on uh measures like gdp per capita so<br>if some of these measures that we've<br>typically used are not very good new<br>zealand turns out to be one of the<br>richer countries in the world rather<br>than and also ran when it comes to<br>developed countries<br>one of the areas that<br>ideas that i had when i first got into<br>this field<br>quite a few years ago was to think well<br>if subjective well-being is to be a<br>guide for policy it also has to be<br>something that can predict what people<br>actually do<br>in economist jargon it has to be a<br>revealed preference help us with<br>revealed preference indicators and one<br>of the strongest uh<br>most important decisions that people<br>make is where they migrate to<br>whether they migrate and if so where to<br>and what i showed here with a colleague<br>from otago dennis wesselbaum in two<br>different papers was that<br>we know from the migration literature<br>that people tend to migrate for income<br>reasons but we showed that they also<br>migrate for subjective well-being<br>reasons they tend to migrate from areas<br>with low subjective well-being and two<br>areas with high subjective well-being<br>even after taking account of income<br>so<br>and then if we look at that at a local<br>level<br>some work i did with kate preston who<br>was a research assistant with me we<br>looked at migration within australia and<br>we found uh the same idea<br>but here's also different effects<br>depending on whether um for men and<br>women<br>in the<br>migration literature we tend to know<br>that migration<br>has been dominated by decisions by males<br>in the past of couples in particular<br>and that males<br>tend to get higher wages after they<br>migrate<br>and female wages tend to drop or<br>stagnate after they migrate but<br>interestingly what we found when people<br>migrate in australia using panel data<br>here longitudinal data is that actually<br>women tend to become happier after they<br>migrate whereas men don't so there was<br>an interesting<br>another area where this area of<br>subjective well-being is very helpful<br>for us is in understanding how<br>relativity shape how people view their<br>life<br>economists have typically thought about<br>absolutes when it comes to how we value<br>income and consumption etc but the work<br>of dick easterlin<br>going back to 1974<br>shows that relativities how we rate<br>ourselves relative to others how our<br>income is relative to others<br>our standing in the pecking order also<br>matters and of course sociologists and<br>others have talked about this for a long<br>time<br>and the paper that i wrote with mark<br>rinehart another former student of mine<br>shows that yes these relativities matter<br>and it's not just local relativities<br>that matter of people around you but<br>also how we rate<br>in terms of our incomes and other things<br>relative to other countries and this has<br>got a little warning<br>note here that it means that we can't<br>just be parochial and look at<br>aspects of economic policies say within<br>new zealand we also have to look at how<br>incomes and other things are doing<br>relative to other countries and in our<br>case especially australia<br>where people can migrate to<br>if it turns out that<br>incomes or quality of life is higher in<br>australia than it is here so we judge<br>ourselves relative to australians and<br>unfortunately australia just keeps up<br>digging up you know new minerals making<br>themselves rich which is unfortunate for<br>us<br>two other aspects which were important<br>uh which we've looked at in the past uh<br>looked at in recent times one is<br>sustainability and one is distribution<br>working with a phd student mohammed<br>mubashir khasteen<br>we<br>showed that there's a<br>potential trade-off between wellbeing<br>and sustainability there are no win-wins<br>when it comes to these sorts of things<br>as much as some people in the policy<br>arena might like<br>what we showed there is that countries<br>that tend to<br>improve their sustainability and we used<br>a number of different measures of that<br>both from the economics literature and<br>the ecological literature<br>countries that promote their<br>sustainability tend not to do as well in<br>promoting their well-being over the next<br>decade<br>although there is some rebound in the<br>following decade two decades hence<br>uh so<br>there is a you know a classic sort of<br>trade-off here between promoting<br>sustainable policies uh sustainables and<br>keeping our resources uh uh in our back<br>pocket if you like for the future and<br>improving well-being now and this is the<br>classic political economy problem that<br>we find where governments<br>keep on putting off actions for instance<br>to do with climate change because they<br>want to improve well-being today<br>and finally just an example um well<br>distribution as well i should have<br>talked about it<br>but i'm working further with a student<br>diana tam on the<br>migration issue<br>and this one was an interesting paper<br>which we're just finalizing for for a<br>revision for it for a journal<br>where we're again looking at migration<br>within australia and using<br>a bargaining model within the household<br>to decide whether people migrate with<br>couples whether they migrate to do with<br>wages or well-being and if so is it the<br>well-being of the female partner or the<br>male partner in a um in a<br>household with a with a male and female<br>partner in it<br>with diana we've also worked on uh the<br>importance of free speech for well-being<br>and how and whether free speech matters<br>more for people at the bottom of the<br>heap or the top of the heap uh it turns<br>out that it matters more for people at<br>the bottom of the heap which is an<br>interesting<br>finding and that's also being worked up<br>for a journal at the moment<br>i had a outstanding<br>master's student last year rowan tom<br>who<br>worked with me both at motu and in his<br>masters to look at the how<br>maori land lost in the 19th century and<br>early 20th century affects current<br>cultural well-being of people from<br>different ewe today and of course<br>differently we had different experiences<br>of land loss so we can take a historical<br>perspective on some of these things as<br>well<br>and with another student florencia<br>tranquili<br>and also stephen jenkins from london<br>school of economics we've looked at<br>inequality of well-being and how to<br>measure that and what effects that has<br>so distributional aspects of well-being<br>important as well<br>and finally i'll just finish with<br>another<br>way that we can use uh well-being<br>approaches next to think about a current<br>policy which is to do with covert<br>and lockdowns<br>many of my uh well-being<br>colleagues internationally especially in<br>the uk and europe have argued against<br>lockdowns on the grounds that they<br>reduce uh well-being of the of the<br>population uh that there are significant<br>mental health effects of lockdowns and<br>other effects that means that lockdowns<br>have negative effects<br>so we've looked at that in new zealand<br>and one of the wonderful things that<br>statistics new zealand did uh at the<br>start of our first lockdown last year<br>was to introduce questions from the<br>general social survey on wellbeing into<br>the quarterly household labor force<br>survey<br>so that started from the<br>second quarter of last year so just on<br>the back end of the first national<br>lockdown and then it's continued every<br>quarter since then so we can follow<br>through well-being effects of lockdowns<br>and other aspects through that time<br>and here's just a little graph to give<br>you a taster of what we can look at that<br>if we look at overall life satisfaction<br>of people across new zealand uh in 2018<br>which is the most recent general social<br>survey it averaged a 7.7 out of 10 this<br>is on this standard question about how<br>you rate your life as a as a whole<br>and at the end of the first lockdown the<br>uh actual life satisfaction in new<br>zealand had gone up to 7.9<br>which is a big jump when it comes to<br>these things the jump of 0.2 is actually<br>very large<br>it went down slightly with the next<br>lockdown with the auckland lockdown<br>and then went ratcheted back up to eight<br>in december 2020<br>and what i've done more recently is to<br>actually use the unit record data to<br>analyze how these effects break down<br>amongst different types of people and<br>especially in auckland relative to other<br>places so we can start actually gauging<br>the effect of policies on particular<br>groups of people and in particular<br>locations<br>spatial effects<br>uh and uh it turns out uh in the recent<br>work i've done in auckland that actually<br>the yorkland lockdown the second<br>auckland knockdown in september 20<br>did have a negative effect on<br>aucklanders relative to the rest of the<br>country at that time<br>what economists call a difference in<br>difference analysis using the unit<br>record data so this approach now is<br>becoming very very useful in looking at<br>how we can evaluate different policies<br>so just some final thoughts i think<br>there are some really promising<br>well-being approaches to policy<br>i'm not a fan of dashboards with lots of<br>indicators and targets they're not much<br>use for prioritizing policies<br>and they don't tend to focus on<br>disadvantaged groups especially when<br>they're put out at the aggregate level<br>although some of the threshold<br>approaches such as multi-dimensional<br>poverty approaches like the sdgs do<br>actually<br>tend to focus on disadvantaged groups<br>but then they ignore people who are more<br>advantaged so they have their<br>disadvantages as well<br>uh and finally i'd say that subjective<br>well-being<br>offers a way forward to understand what<br>really matters for people's welfare it's<br>being used in policy analysis today and<br>cost-benefit analysis or cost well-being<br>analysis<br>throughout the world<br>we can actually measure how different<br>policies affect people's well-being and<br>compare those with how they affect how<br>different other policies affect<br>well-being they're also very useful for<br>looking at how different policies affect<br>specific groups such as the work i<br>talked about before in terms of the<br>well-being of mothers and with dependent<br>children as opposed to the well-being of<br>other groups<br>but christian i'll leave it there for<br>now i'll stop sharing my screen if i can<br>and even throw it over to you<br>thank you very much that was very very<br>interesting and of course<br>very much close to the heart of the sdgs<br>because well-being<br>in good health is stg3 but arguably<br>well-being has a much deeper<br>position across the sdgs<br>so that was really interesting i would<br>now like to invite our audience to<br>type your questions into the chat box<br>which we found to be the most effective<br>way of having a discussion at the end<br>so the the chat is in your<br>zoom bar and<br>yeah you can just uh write your<br>questions to<br>to everybody else so i can sort of<br>manage and moderate them a little bit<br>um<br>while people are doing that can i<br>can you maybe um<br>start off with the question about<br>that interesting<br>position where you say that<br>sustainability and well-being don't<br>necessarily go hand in hand which is a<br>really interesting<br>perspective because<br>in many<br>conceptualizations of sustainability<br>well-being is a core component social<br>well-being cultural well-being<br>um so that's a really interesting<br>perspective can you expand on that a<br>little bit please<br>yeah well i mean typically governments<br>um<br>when they want to get re-elected<br>uh try to improve<br>people's well-being in the short term<br>uh<br>you know through expansionary budgets<br>and you know spending up large and wage<br>subsidies or whatever else they want to<br>sort of think of at the time<br>and uh<br>these uh you know we know from past<br>experience in new zealand how these have<br>led to very unsustainable policies you<br>know high debt and uh which basically<br>reduces the well-being of future<br>generations who have to pay off that<br>debt and of course we you know we went<br>through the whole process up to 1984 and<br>in post 84 we built up massive debt by<br>trying to improve people's well-being in<br>the short term and then had to<br>you know next generation had to pay that<br>back um and now of course in the last<br>three years or two years since covert<br>came along uh we've built up a massive<br>debt again for the next generation to<br>pay off although i think this one is a<br>lot more<br>you know justifiable than than previous<br>attempts to doing it<br>and this is just a typical<br>choice that people make at an individual<br>level and a policy level between<br>consumption today and consumption<br>tomorrow you know saving consumption day<br>saving for tomorrow now that saving can<br>be in the form of financial assets but<br>it can also be saving in the form of<br>preserving natural capital uh you know<br>we could be uh using up lots of our<br>natural capital today which would<br>increase our current well-being um<br>because you know<br>we're becoming rich in the short term<br>but that natural capital is not there<br>for the future<br>uh and so it's very much along the lines<br>that we would expect um from uh you know<br>a standard sort of analysis<br>uh that if you<br>um want to put aside resources for the<br>future you're not using them today so<br>you're foregoing well-being today<br>by doing that<br>um there's a fantastic uh analysis of<br>this by kenneth arrow and path of<br>descriptor and others um sort of the<br>probably the classic work on this back<br>in 2014 or so<br>um on<br>how we can<br>judge whether<br>um the well-being<br>trajectory if you like of a country is<br>also consistent with<br>uh sustainability uh in terms of<br>increasing<br>uh the country's<br>what they call comprehensive wealth over<br>time wealth measured including natural<br>capital human capital and physical<br>capital etc<br>uh so this trade-off shouldn't be<br>surprising to anyone i think what<br>surprises me is people who think there's<br>not a trade-off<br>i've always thought that you know<br>there's in the policy area people always<br>talk about these win-wins but it's<br>virtually virtually never in my policy<br>experience of 40 years that i see a<br>win-win<br>interesting and i suppose it comes down<br>to how we conceptualize sustainability<br>and whether<br>we take a quite a holistic perspective<br>or a more a more focused one maybe<br>very very interesting um<br>can i also ask<br>um about the<br>the life satisfaction in december 2020<br>was that the highest<br>ever recorded or how does it relate to<br>other periods<br>pre-pre-culvert because that's a really<br>astonishing<br>insight into the mentality of new<br>zealanders doing<br>being a fairly you know difficult time<br>yeah it's the highest since stats new<br>zealand has instituted that that<br>definition of<br>um well-being unfortunately they used to<br>have a five-point scale and then they<br>changed to an 11-point scale so we can't<br>compare that reading with uh<br>at times further back<br>but it's certainly higher than um<br>2018 16 and 14 which were the three<br>satisfaction measured on that scale yeah<br>cool and now a question from winston<br>roberts i'm interested to know more<br>about the research by diana tam and to<br>the impact of free speech on well-being<br>yeah this was a fascinating um project<br>which i uh supervised diana's<br>master's work on this and we've since<br>written a paper on it<br>uh we used<br>um well-being data from around the world<br>the world values survey has been<br>collecting data like this for the last<br>40 years across many different countries<br>and then we combine that with<br>measures of<br>free speech which have been compiled<br>by some u.s academics<br>and then we<br>we see whether changes in free speech<br>in different countries after controlling<br>for all sorts of other human rights in<br>those countries and after controlling<br>for gdp income and all those sorts of<br>things<br>in particular we look at whether free<br>speech<br>is important for people who are a high<br>income or are highly educated<br>or people who are low income and lowly<br>educated and we had two complete we're<br>two sort of separate hypotheses here one<br>is that<br>things like free speech might be a<br>luxury good as economists would term<br>it's only when you get you know beyond a<br>certain stage in maslow's hierarchy that<br>you start worrying about things like<br>free speech<br>so that would most benefit people at the<br>top of the pyramid<br>on the other hand people at the top of<br>the pyramid often have access to<br>governments and government officials and<br>etc<br>so it may not be so important for them<br>it may be more important at the bottom<br>end<br>and what we found very very strongly in<br>that uh using this unit record date of<br>you know so hundreds of thousands of<br>observations and tens of thousands of<br>observations<br>of different people across many<br>different you know across decades and<br>across many countries<br>was that it's the people at the bottom<br>end who are most affected by changes in<br>free speech so who benefit most from<br>excellent thank you and now a question<br>from<br>shelly cook<br>which is very relevant to otero new<br>zealand and also the pacific there's any<br>work being done on exploring te al maori<br>and or pacifica approaches<br>to well-being this may address<br>multi-generational well-being and narrow<br>the gap to the sustainability trader<br>so yeah very very interesting that's a<br>great question there's been quite a lot<br>of work done especially on um<br>taumari approaches to wellbeing<br>um<br>going uh quite a way back i mean mason<br>jury would be the obviously the classic<br>one back in 1985 when he was writing<br>about this in his social science<br>uh in medicine uh paper on the the four<br>pillars you know the um of uh<br>of maori well-being and interestingly he<br>he came up with those four pillars<br>uh<br>after going and having hui around um<br>mirai around the country and talking to<br>uh to to the elders in particular um<br>after that that was sort of the dominant<br>framework since then uh people like tahu<br>kukutai at waikato university and others<br>have worked with subaru when it was<br>still<br>going to come up with another very nice<br>framework<br>and then more recently<br>there's been other frameworks<br>stats new zealand worked on what's<br>called the taikupanga survey which is a<br>general social survey designed<br>especially for mari and again that was<br>very nicely done because it was done<br>with very widespread consultation with<br>maori as to what the kinds of aspects of<br>well-being that are particularly<br>important to maori so it includes for<br>instance questions on have you visited<br>your traditional mirai<br>in the last 12 months and these sorts of<br>questions so very different questions to<br>what we'd ask elsewhere<br>both tpk and treasury have designed<br>maori wellbeing frameworks uh tpk<br>came up with what's a very nice one it's<br>actually published as a treasury working<br>paper because it was being done at the<br>time of the tax working group and then<br>treasury at the same time came up with<br>hayara wyora which is their own version<br>done with consultation with a few people<br>but it's nowhere near as consultative as<br>some of the other<br>frameworks<br>but many of these approaches have very<br>very similar approaches there's some<br>pacifica approaches as well the follow<br>fonifalae approach<br>and more recent ones<br>and they tend to emphasize relationships<br>between people and processes<br>much more so than do the traditional<br>yes because i think the also in pacific<br>encounters that intergenerational<br>contract so to speak is much more<br>pronounced in the in their<br>conceptualizations of<br>sustainability so a really<br>really interesting perspective to look<br>at through the cultural lens of what we<br>even<br>consider to be sustainability yeah and<br>just on that i'm doing a doing work at<br>the moment with a large endeavor grant<br>um on uh public housing and there we're<br>working with pacifica and maori groups<br>on specific aspects of maori wellbeing<br>and pacific well-being uh and thinking<br>about what framework should we use to<br>measure well-being of tenants maori<br>tenants and pacific attendance in<br>in public housing areas<br>excellent it will be great to have you<br>back to talk about that research soon<br>um and now another question um from<br>grant spencer is there any international<br>agency that is developing a standard<br>approach<br>oh good question grant um<br>i think the approach that is<br>the de facto one is probably the<br>treasury's uk treasury's green book uh<br>which i think most people around<br>the world are looking at they've<br>incorporated something called welby's in<br>there which is a well-being year which<br>is basically if you have a project um<br>that's<br>um<br>has a certain return in terms of lifting<br>people's subjective well-being uh let's<br>say it's a particular project that will<br>lift somebody's well-being by a step of<br>one from say seven to an eight for two<br>years that's equivalent to a lift of two<br>and if the average life uh average life<br>satisfaction was eight and then two<br>divided by eight would be a quarter of a<br>well-being year so it's very much along<br>the lines of a quality adjusted life<br>year in the health<br>literature<br>and<br>this approach is now<br>being adopted by a number of different<br>agencies it's not been adopted by an<br>international agency as such but it's<br>probably the one that's most<br>seizing people's attention at the moment<br>and while i encourage debate about the<br>sdgs i'm not necessarily a<br>a<br>complete convinced advocate but<br>could the sdgs provide such a framework<br>at least at some levels because it is a<br>global roadmap that articulates specific<br>aspirations around well-being<br>in my view<br>no as you know i'm not a fan of dash but<br>you can see i'm not a fan of dashboard<br>approaches<br>and<br>also the sdgs are really targeted at<br>getting people above a certain threshold<br>which i think is incredibly important<br>from a distributional aspect but it<br>doesn't help with designing policies for<br>once you're above that threshold and<br>this is the problem also with the bhutan<br>approach which is very similar<br>so<br>there's no reason why the wellbeing<br>approach couldn't be incorporated into<br>the sdgs um as one aspect for that<br>particular group but i don't think it's<br>i don't you know i see<br>um<br>the sdgs is not particularly useful for<br>um other than getting people above a<br>wide range of thresholds<br>excellent and<br>although<br>some more questions have come in which<br>i'm very pleased about<br>i'm sorry but we have to draw this<br>webinar to a close because otherwise we<br>will go over time so thank you very much<br>to the audience for your questions for<br>your and for your participation and most<br>of all of course thank you very much to<br>arthur for sharing your research<br>and sharing this really interesting<br>perspectives on subjective well-being<br>and<br>how or the many ways in which we can<br>approach this topic<br>so thank you very much thank you<br>christian<br>and<br>please think about the mailing list if<br>you have an interest in these types of<br>seminars<br>for next year<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
