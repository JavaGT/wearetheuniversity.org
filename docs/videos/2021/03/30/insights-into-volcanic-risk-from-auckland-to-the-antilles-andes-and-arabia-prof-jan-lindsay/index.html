In her presentation Professor Lindsay will take you on a journey around the world to some amazing volcanoes that she has had the pleasure to research, and also acknowledge those who she has had the privilege of working with during her career. A consistent focus of her research has been on improving societal resilience to volcanic hazards – in the early years by better understanding magmatic and volcanic processes, and in more recent years by developing and testing techniques for effective communication between scientists and stakeholders, including through volcanic hazard maps. Insights from Professor Lindsay’s research and her experiences highlight the value of collaborative, user-centered approaches to natural hazard risk research, and importance of good science communication, especially during a crisis.<br><br>Jan Lindsay is a volcanologist in the School of Environment at the University of Auckland. She was born in Rotorua, and spent her childhood in Rotorua, Western Samoa and Auckland. She has a BSc and an MSc in Geology from the University of Auckland, and a PhD in Geosciences from the University of Giessen in Germany. She has held positions at GNS Science in Taupō; the GeoResearch Centre (GFZ) in Potsdam, Germany; and the University of the West Indies in Trinidad. She is Vice President of the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI) and is co-leader of the IAVCEI Working Group on Volcanic Hazard Mapping. She is a Past President of the Geoscience Society of New Zealand. She has worked on projects in the broad area of volcanic geology, hazard and risk in New Zealand, Chile, the Lesser Antilles, Hawai’i and Saudi Arabia.<br><br>For more videos from the University of

stacked up<br>post-covered inaugural professorial<br>lectures where we<br>had this rush of people who got promoted<br>and weren't able to give their<br>inaugural lectures last year and we need<br>to get them through<br>um so i'm i'm very glad that jan<br>hasn't done what i know that somebody at<br>canterbury university<br>has done which is to decide to give the<br>electorate by zoom<br>so you don't even get drinks glad you<br>didn't do that<br>it's hardly surprising that somebody<br>born in rotorua should develop an<br>interest in volcanoes i'm sure<br>no doubt she was expecting that to be<br>said and of course jan's done that<br>and um volcanoes it seems to me are<br>often found in some of the most<br>beautiful parts of the world and<br>so jan's had a well-traveled career<br>spending time in the<br>famous international tourist hot spots<br>of of course rotorua<br>western samara taupo the west indies<br>hawaii and of course potsdam<br>she's<br>she's a relatively recent recruit to to<br>academia having having worked for gns<br>science first and<br>joining us as a research fellow so she's<br>particularly new<br>to teaching active academia and it's<br>remarkable that in that time that she's<br>been doing that<br>she's already graduated about 30<br>postgraduate research students some of<br>whom i'm sure will be here tonight<br>including 12 phds amazing record<br>so jan's research is is both uh prolific<br>and impactful with<br>well over 100 publications i tried to<br>google scholar her today and lost count<br>and a remarkable i-10<br>index of 74 showing that hardly any of<br>her work gets<br>ignored it all gets cited she's been<br>influential on on policy both in new<br>zealand and internationally<br>and she's currently vice president of<br>the let me get this right<br>the international association of<br>volcanology and chemistry of the earth<br>center<br>and and generally speaking uh<br>leadership has been a great feature of<br>jan's career right from the start she<br>did for us<br>a wonderful job as uh acting head of<br>environment<br>and she's now a particularly effective<br>associate dean research<br>well i think for me one of jan's most<br>important contributions for the faculty<br>has been leading our early career<br>mentoring program<br>so facilitating and then going on to<br>celebrate the<br>success of others particularly our<br>junior colleagues<br>i think is one of the best attributes of<br>this faculty's culture and<br>and jan's been a big part of making that<br>happen so thank you for that<br>i've had the pleasure of working with<br>jan quite closely in various<br>uh circumstances over the last five or<br>six years some of those<br>those being on matters that have needed<br>quite sensitive handling and it<br>and it's a testament to jan that she's<br>one of the first persons we thought of<br>to do that<br>so one of the things that has really<br>stood out for me has been<br>of course his sort of obvious insight<br>attention to detail stuff like that that<br>we would expect academics to do<br>but there's there's this kind of<br>combination of pragmatism<br>and compassion which is i think a bit<br>unusual<br>jan is absolutely one of the faculty's<br>go-to people and she has more influence<br>in how the place works than her official<br>roles might necessarily suggest<br>it's great to see jan added to the very<br>small club<br>of female geology professors in new<br>zealand we think that there are only two<br>others and of course they're both from<br>auckland too<br>lindsay<br>i began by summoning vitality and<br>well-being to settle among all of us<br>present i acknowledge the spiritual<br>realm especially ranginui and<br>papatuanuku<br>i acknowledge those loved ones who have<br>died and expressed that they rest in<br>peace<br>i thank doug for his warm greetings and<br>kind words<br>i acknowledge all of you who have come<br>here today to celebrate my professorship<br>with me<br>kawai aho who am i my ancestors are from<br>ireland scotland and england<br>my grandparents were born in and around<br>christchurch and akaroa<br>i was born in rotorua among the<br>volcanoes of the north island<br>tongariro is the mountain that speaks to<br>my heart<br>i live in riverhead and rangitapuni is<br>the river that washes away my worries<br>my parents are murray and cath folker is<br>my partner<br>and tom and leon are our children my<br>name is jan lindsey<br>i'm a professor of volcanology<br>i'd like to extend the really warm<br>welcome to all of you today thank you<br>all so much for coming<br>including bubs um i'd also like to<br>welcome those who are listening to the<br>recording overseas or watching the<br>recording<br>overseas or not overseas<br>particularly my dear friend totty in<br>canada who was at my phd<br>defence over 20 years ago in germany i<br>mean who wanted to be here today but<br>couldn't because of the border closures<br>so a warm greeting to totti over in<br>canada<br>so i'm now going to dim the lights and<br>get going<br>what i'm going to do today is take you<br>on a journey<br>to some of the places that i've worked<br>in and during my career<br>and also introduce you to some of the<br>different types of volcanoes that i've<br>worked on and the different topics that<br>i've worked on<br>this is an overview of my talk i'm going<br>to briefly touch on how i came to be a<br>geologist<br>a brief overview of my career here<br>whakatoki<br>which frames the presentation a<br>framework for understanding my research<br>and volcanic hazard and risk<br>we're going on a journey first to the<br>andes where i'll focus mostly on a type<br>of volcano called calderas<br>then on to the lesser antilles in the<br>caribbean<br>where i worked on stratovolcanoes as<br>well as some calderas<br>and then back to auckland with a stint<br>in saudi arabia<br>and that's where i'll talk about<br>monogenetic fields i'll explain that in<br>a minute<br>but first how i came to be a geologist<br>in 1995 i graduated with an msc in<br>geology<br>um actually much to my surprise<br>considering i started university to do a<br>bachelor of arts and languages<br>in german and english and the reason<br>the reason i decided to do geology was i<br>had a gap<br>in my program and i read through the<br>calendar and found the<br>the paper that sounded most interesting<br>and it was the stage one geology paper<br>and so i filled up my calendar with my<br>program with that<br>paper and the rest is history over the<br>course of my three-year degree i<br>transitioned from an arts degree to a<br>geology<br>degree although i didn't actually get a<br>master of science in<br>geology and master of science and<br>geology on the day<br>my brother and i who my brother's here<br>in the audience today we both<br>got a certificate in a graduation snafu<br>that said um<br>master of science and chemistry brent<br>i did go and swap it my supervisor for<br>my um<br>my supervisors for my masters were ian<br>smith who's here in the audience today<br>so i have a bsc in an msc in geology<br>from the university of auckland<br>i was then a research assistant at gns<br>science and i was there during the<br>eruption of ruapehu in 1995 which was<br>very exciting and probably set me on my<br>path towards more applied volcanology<br>i did a phd in geosciences in germany<br>from the gif<br>said the geo research center in potsdam<br>and the university of geesen<br>then i moved to trinidad to the seismic<br>research centre<br>which is part of the university of the<br>west indies and these are just some<br>pictures of my<br>journey along the way then i had my most<br>important job<br>of all which was having my my two lovely<br>boys who are here today<br>somewhere<br>of course i've grown up now and this is<br>what the<br>photo from from last year tom was born<br>in trinidad and leon was born in<br>auckland<br>so i had a few years off um since 2007<br>i've been at the school of environment<br>here at the university<br>and for almost all of my career i have<br>been supported by the new zealand<br>earthquake commission<br>and i'd just like to take a moment to<br>thank them for the for supporting me for<br>believing in me<br>and for um funding me to do some of the<br>amazing research that i've done<br>over my career and these are just some<br>photos of various things that i have<br>on to our whakatoki which sort of frames<br>this talk<br>my success is not mine alone but based<br>on the success of many<br>and i think this is true of anyone who<br>reaches professor level<br>you know we have a lot of phd students<br>we have a lot of collaborations as doug<br>touched on<br>this slide shows many of the<br>collaborators that i've had the pleasure<br>of working with over the years and all<br>of my phd students past<br>and present unnamed and i'd just like to<br>thank every one of them<br>i'd like to leave it on so that you can<br>all have a look but i have to i have to<br>move forward<br>i have one more slide of people um<br>these are some of the key collaborators<br>that i've had the pleasure of working<br>with<br>over my career and i'd just like to to<br>give a shout out to them<br>all the collaborators that i've worked<br>with i've named my post-doctoral fellows<br>so a couple of slides just to provide a<br>bit of a framework for my research<br>volcanoes can be divided into more or<br>less three main types there's the real<br>big ones that generate super eruptions<br>and they are often referred to as<br>calderas and the example that i'm going<br>to show you of these is from the andes<br>then there's sort of an intermediate<br>style type of volcano which are<br>stratovolcanoes<br>and these are often intermediate in<br>composition<br>and intermediate in size the eruptions<br>and there are many of these in the<br>lesser antilles<br>and then there are small scoria cones<br>and mars mars or explosion craters<br>they're typically basaltic they're<br>typically small<br>and they're often in distributed fields<br>and the auckland volcanic field is a<br>good example<br>basaltic is when i say ryeolytic and<br>basaltic these are different types of<br>magma<br>rhyolitic magmas have a lot of silica in<br>them and they produce pumice and big<br>explosive eruptions like this one and<br>um basaltic magmas are darker they have<br>a lot of dark<br>mafic minerals lower in silica and they<br>another way to frame my research is sort<br>of more thematic<br>so when i talk about volcanic risk it's<br>a combination<br>of both the hazard which is the<br>likelihood and the type of phenomena<br>that might occur<br>but also the elements of society that<br>might be in harm's way<br>of that particular hazardous phenomena<br>and if you combine those things together<br>you get risk<br>risk is the likelihood of something bad<br>happening<br>if we don't know the likelihood of<br>something bad happening we talk<br>often about impacts so impacts are sort<br>of conditional on something happening if<br>auckland erupted tomorrow<br>what would the impacts be that's that's<br>slightly different to risk<br>and over time my research sorry<br>auckland's not going to rock tomorrow my<br>research over time has moved from more<br>geology focused more fundamental focused<br>through to incorporate hazard and then<br>in more recent years to also incorporate<br>impact and risk so i've become more<br>applied in my research with time<br>and you'll see that as we go through<br>right so we're off to the andes<br>off to chile this is at the border of<br>chile where i did my phd research<br>i was based at the gifted in potsdam<br>but my field area was chile lucky me<br>so during my phd i worked in an area<br>called the altiplano puna volcanic<br>complex and it's in the central<br>volcanic zone of the andes and all of<br>these<br>yellowish areas on the slide and also on<br>the satellite image here<br>are deposits from really really big<br>pyroclastic flows<br>and they're sort of hot mixtures of<br>gas and rock and ash that<br>form the big flows across the landscape<br>that form when those huge big eruption<br>clouds collapse down to earth and spread<br>a big flow out<br>and i studied those i worked on those so<br>there's lots of calderas these big<br>volcanoes that create super eruptions in<br>this area and one of them is called<br>lapakana and it's in this area<br>just here this is the area that i worked<br>in so if we zoom in there<br>here we are here's this funny shaped<br>resurgent block<br>where the magma sort of pushed up at the<br>end and pushed up some deposits to form<br>this<br>this funny shape it's four million years<br>old so it's quite old it's a<br>technically um sort of a super volcano<br>one of these big cold areas and this is<br>what the landscape looks like<br>this is san pedro de atacama if anyone's<br>been in that area you'll you'll know<br>that<br>town it's quite well known and if you<br>drive up over the andes and onto the<br>plateau<br>up beyond these volcanoes you have this<br>vast<br>big area where there are still lots of<br>volcanoes but that's the area that i<br>worked<br>up in here and what i did was i took<br>lots and lots of samples i analyzed them<br>and i was able to create this geology<br>map<br>which correlated<br>the deposits from this volcano and ones<br>that had previously been applied<br>or assigned to this volcano like this<br>green one and i was able to say actually<br>that's from a volcano over here in<br>bolivia<br>so that was a cool piece of work quite<br>geology focused<br>i wasn't so much thinking of hazard back<br>then<br>i was however very interested in how<br>magma chambers work<br>and how we can actually get a handle on<br>when they erupt and when magmatic<br>processes occur<br>minerals called zircons and this is a<br>picture of zircons these are tiny little<br>things this is a<br>fraction of a millimeter and<br>zircons are very resilient they grow in<br>these sort of silicic rhyolitic type<br>magmas they're very comfortable in those<br>magmas<br>and they form little sort of growth<br>zones a little bit like tree rings and<br>if you can date those you can work out<br>what<br>the timing is of magmatic processes and<br>you can date the rims and actually get<br>the age of<br>eruptions so i've done some work in<br>various places using zircons and this is<br>one example with<br>my phd student sonia she worked on<br>zircons from a caldera<br>in the north island okatina volcano and<br>she was able to develop a mag<br>a model of the magma chamber based on<br>zircons and the great thing about dating<br>these zones and the room is that you can<br>get an idea of magnitude frequency<br>relationships which are important for<br>assessing hazard<br>how often has the volcano erupted i've<br>been lucky enough to be able to work<br>back in the andes more recently with my<br>phd student danielle<br>shown here this is us a couple of years<br>ago in argentina<br>and we're working with a bunch of<br>collaborators from chile and argentina<br>and the us<br>and shane cronin<br>to look at all of these volcanoes<br>in the central volcanic zone to get a<br>handle on<br>volumes and ages to try and get an idea<br>of the volcanic hazard in this area and<br>danielle remember i showed you this<br>little area here in the corner of chile<br>where i did my map<br>danielle has done this amazing mapping<br>project where he's mapped a huge area<br>and it's really really important because<br>you'll notice here this little hazard<br>map of a portion of<br>the volcanoes in the central volcanic<br>zone all of the volcanic deposits stop<br>all the hazards stop at the border so<br>obviously volcanoes don't stop at the<br>border and the processes don't stop at<br>the border so<br>collaborations are really needed to um<br>between in this case chileans and<br>argentinians to come up with<br>hazard maps in the in the border<br>volcanoes<br>it's a very challenging area and<br>danielle's done a great job pulling<br>together all of these researchers to<br>tackle this problem so i'm not only<br>interested in the geology<br>of these volcanoes but also<br>um the hazard associated with them and<br>and one aspect is the work with danielle<br>another aspect is looking at how we can<br>d look in detail at the deposits in the<br>field<br>and use those uh data that we get<br>to inform process models numerical<br>models and here's an example<br>my student robert is looking at<br>how we can use field deposits and<br>detailed measurements of big<br>ash and ash deposits asphalt deposits in<br>the field to recreate these big eruption<br>plumes<br>and then feed that data into hazard<br>models<br>and then the next step is to work out<br>well if you have a big interruption like<br>a big eruption like this what will the<br>impacts be<br>and you could look at impacts on any<br>but one aspect that i'll touch on today<br>is work by my student<br>sheetha who looked at the impact of a<br>of a big eruption on pasture and what<br>you could do to perhaps remediate<br>pasture what farmers could do if there<br>was a big<br>dumping of tephra which is volcanic air<br>fall<br>so volcanic ash more or less<br>and auckla in new zealand so here's the<br>north island this just shows that we<br>have a history of ash falling on pasture<br>areas which are all the areas shown in<br>green on this map this is the ruapehu<br>eruption showing the areas where<br>ash was deposited so the green is all of<br>the pasture farms<br>and shitel went and talked to a whole<br>bunch of farmers and said what would you<br>do what are some of the remediation<br>techniques that you would<br>um you would possibly use and then she<br>did some experiments with all of these<br>different remediation techniques<br>and she found that applying cowshed<br>effluent<br>so the stuff that the dung that comes<br>out of cow sheds mixed in with the<br>tephra<br>can actually help the grass to grow<br>again<br>so a brief pause to share some insights<br>from the andes and beyond<br>field geology so important it underpins<br>all volcanic hazard<br>and therefore risk studies low<br>probability but high consequence events<br>like super eruptions need to be studied<br>and planned for<br>low probability does not equal no<br>probability we saw that with the<br>canterbury earthquakes<br>very low probability of occurrence but<br>they happened<br>volcanoes don't recognize national<br>borders and close collaboration is<br>so now we're going to move on to the<br>lesser antilles the lesser antilles are<br>a chain of<br>islands at the eastern margin of the<br>caribbean sea so here's a little<br>location map here's venezuela<br>and i moved to trinidad with folker<br>um in about 2000 here's trinidad down<br>here it's just to this<br>just to the north of venezuela um and<br>i worked in the sort of like a volcano<br>observatory the seismic research unit<br>and we monitored all of these volcanoes<br>that stretch from<br>grenada in the south up to sabre in the<br>north there's about 21 volcanic centres<br>that are potentially active<br>there's been 34 historical eruptions and<br>here's just a couple of photos of me<br>in the field in the lesser antilles<br>the main projects i worked on over there<br>were looking at<br>the evolution and the time scales and<br>the hazards<br>of the various volcanoes in these<br>islands but in particular<br>st lucia and dominica so<br>what i did was i did a lot of field work<br>and i went around and i sampled<br>um the deposits including big ones like<br>this<br>with thick deposits from these big<br>pyroclastic<br>flows that i told you about before and<br>collected pumice from them<br>and i did geochemical analyses and i<br>dated zircons there we go again to work<br>out<br>how old the deposits were but also what<br>the magma chamber might have been doing<br>over time and here's just a little<br>example of a<br>graphic from one of our papers on saint<br>lucia showing how the magma chamber has<br>evolved with time<br>so one of the things that you can do<br>when you date<br>eruptions like that is you can correlate<br>deposits you can say oh<br>that deposit and that deposit are from<br>the same eruption<br>and so in that way i was able to say<br>well this one deposit that everyone had<br>said is this massive big eruption at 40<br>000 years<br>it's actually an eruption it's actually<br>four eruptions that occurred over a<br>longer period of time<br>and my phd student tracy um<br>took on this work and she did a very<br>similar but way more detailed study on<br>dominica<br>and she used this zerk this very<br>detailed zircon dating to create a<br>timeline of magmatic processes and<br>eruptions<br>on the island and on dominica<br>and what you can see here is this is age<br>so here's<br>zero and here's greater than 350 000<br>years<br>and these just represents represent<br>magmas that were active at that time and<br>erupting at the surface<br>and what she was able to show was that<br>the pyroclastic flow deposits from these<br>biggest eruptions<br>actually had zircons in them that formed<br>all the way back to 350 000 years ago<br>which suggests that there's a big<br>semi-connected<br>mush zone beneath the whole island she<br>was also able to show that another big<br>deposit that everyone had thought was<br>this huge big deposit<br>that had dumped ash all the way out here<br>into the ocean these are isopacks<br>was actually a series of a whole lot of<br>smaller eruptions<br>the roseau tuff is the name of that that<br>particular option<br>i was also very interested in setting up<br>a geothermal monitoring program on<br>in the eastern caribbean in the lesser<br>antilles<br>typically when we monitor volcanoes<br>there's sort of a holy trinity of<br>seismic monitoring geothermal monitoring<br>and what we call deformation monitoring<br>watching the land move up and down<br>if we can using satellites or<br>instruments and there was no geothermal<br>monitoring network for these volcanoes<br>so i did a lot of tripping around to<br>geothermal fields looking a bit like<br>this and<br>sampling geothermal fluids here's an<br>underwater seep that we were sampling<br>that was a big adventure<br>and here's another example of collecting<br>sampling gases<br>and my phd student pat joined the team<br>and wrote her phd on this topic and it<br>was the first phd<br>in volcanology ever to be awarded by the<br>university of the west indies<br>so pat was able to characterize all of<br>those fluids and gases and set a<br>baseline<br>for future monitoring in the lesser<br>antilles<br>another big project i worked on<br>throughout my entire time<br>was hazard assessments and creating<br>hazard maps<br>in the islands and the caribbean so i<br>went around<br>looked at volcanoes looked at their<br>deposits<br>compared those deposits with what<br>i'd seen at other analog volcanoes for<br>example<br>this is a block and ash flow deposit<br>which is created when a dome<br>collapses like this example here on<br>monserrate it forms a deposit like that<br>and then this here is more of an a<br>volcanian airfall deposit which happens<br>when a volcano erupts like that so<br>you sort of look at analogs and try and<br>spit like forensic science to try and<br>work out what<br>actually happened and based on that<br>information i was able to create hazard<br>maps<br>for each of the potentially active<br>volcanoes in the area<br>the we took the hazard maps<br>and turned them into something that we<br>thought was more easy for people to<br>understand we integrated the hazard<br>zones<br>into these traffic light colours<br>created lovely posters and they were<br>widely dispersed to all of the<br>they call them disaster managers<br>emergency managers<br>in the islands and all of the schools<br>and they were used extensively by these<br>emergency managers and even just<br>recently<br>there's a new dome growing in saint<br>vincent<br>and my map or our map really um it was a<br>collaboration<br>is showing up on a lot of the<br>communication around this um new<br>volcano that's or the new dome that's<br>formed just here<br>in the crater of la sufria and saint<br>vincent<br>we produced all of these maps put them<br>in a book um<br>and thought ah didn't we do well we're<br>so good we created these all these maps<br>and<br>did such a good job and then we started<br>to notice that<br>okay the disaster management community<br>were really interested in our maps and<br>they were using them but there was<br>little uptake from other<br>what we would have thought would have<br>been stakeholders like<br>land use planners for example and also<br>some papers started to appear in the<br>literature<br>here's an example on montserrat people<br>struggle with location and orientation<br>tasks when given contour maps<br>perspective maps are better this is a<br>volcano in the area that we were working<br>on<br>this was social science work another<br>social science study in stromboli<br>experts prefer contour maps to aerial<br>photographs on stromboli<br>and actually that like tsunami and<br>volcano has it on the same map<br>and i started to think oh my goodness i<br>didn't even think about who would be<br>using this map i didn't even think to go<br>and talk to them<br>about what they might want on a map so<br>this got me<br>really interested in volcanic hazard<br>maps<br>so just a little slide to explain a bit<br>more about what volcanic hazard maps are<br>they can be really really important a<br>really important tool<br>because they put parties on the same<br>page of hazard information i like that<br>quote<br>quite literally in this case of cotopaxi<br>but only if they're developed<br>communicated and<br>used appropriately for a given<br>volcanic setting and cultural and<br>political context<br>and i'm part of an emerging effort<br>internationally<br>actually it's quite reasonably well<br>established now we've been going for a<br>few years<br>to embrace hazard maps as a important<br>communication tool<br>and to understand how content and design<br>of hazard maps<br>influences how effective they are so<br>this brings me to marianne's phd<br>and marianne worked on creating a hazard<br>assessment<br>for ocotino volcano and these are some<br>of the maps<br>or some of the data that came out of her<br>geology-based work<br>and this time i said right we're not<br>just going to create a map we're<br>actually going to create a few different<br>maps and go and talk to people that<br>might be using the map to find out which<br>one they understand best<br>so marianne created several different<br>maps<br>that showed the same kind of data and<br>she found that this particular<br>style of map conveyed the gist of the<br>hazard best<br>it shows these sequential hues but also<br>has<br>iso packs these happen to be tephra<br>hazard maps<br>and readers were able to more correctly<br>read the values off this particular map<br>she also used different colors to see<br>how that would affect things<br>this particular hue the sequential hue<br>conveyed the sense of degree of hazard<br>so participants in her study said oh yes<br>i can see that this means less to more<br>hazard<br>as you get redder it's more hazard but<br>these blue these diverging hues<br>most participants thought these conveyed<br>a sense of<br>presence or absence of hazard so<br>for them the blue areas were probably<br>safe and the warmer colors were<br>dangerous<br>and so they thought well actually if we<br>were to set<br>a decision-making threshold we would put<br>it at the boundary between those colors<br>and that may not be the message that<br>you're trying to convey<br>with your maps she also explored the<br>issue of<br>color vision deficiencies<br>lots of people are colorblind look at<br>this<br>if you produce a map that has this<br>traffic light<br>color combination which i did for my<br>maps in the lesser antilles<br>well colorblind people have trouble<br>seeing<br>um the green sometimes it looks very<br>similar to orange<br>but luckily there are some tools that<br>you can put maps through like color<br>brewer<br>to see if they are suitable for people<br>with color vision deficiencies and<br>here's an example of a color scheme that<br>works because you can see a distinct<br>this is what a colorblind person would<br>see a particular type of color vision<br>deficiency<br>would see if you if you showed them this<br>map and you can see<br>it's very clear that the hues are<br>different<br>marianne went on to do a postdoc in the<br>general<br>the general theme i guess of hazard map<br>design and content<br>and she did some more user testing she<br>set up some<br>hazard maps that depict um hazard<br>at taranaki volcano and asked her<br>study participants what route would you<br>take if you had an urgent plane to catch<br>and you were in here in open<br>in the airport's over here and this is<br>the hazard map etc and she was able to<br>record what the people<br>said so she found that a signing or we<br>found that assigning a simple task can<br>actually enhance map reading because it<br>directs you to look at certain things on<br>the map<br>she also asked what information do you<br>want on hazard maps and one of the<br>things that people said is<br>areas that are safe or not exposed to<br>hazards<br>which is the exact opposite of what we<br>put on hazard maps<br>right we put hazard on hazard maps so<br>that was interesting<br>so showing safer areas alongside the<br>hazard areas may help readers actually<br>process the information that's on the<br>maps<br>she also showed hazard in different ways<br>to see<br>which type of depiction of hazard might<br>be more effective<br>and she also did this cool experiment<br>where she tracked<br>where people looked on a map when you<br>ask particular questions<br>so all of these little heat maps show<br>focus or gaze<br>um that the participants were focusing<br>on this was a great collaboration with<br>some colleagues in psychology and also<br>overseas<br>what she found was this type of map the<br>integrated map where the hazards are<br>grouped together<br>convey the gist of the hazard but they<br>they may also result in higher perceived<br>levels of threat so the readers of the<br>maps thought that the hazard was higher<br>than perhaps it actually was<br>and high risk perceptions are actually<br>associated with limited visual attention<br>so if you<br>are if you are if you have a high risk<br>perception<br>if you think the volcano is very very<br>dangerous you don't pay as much<br>attention to the map<br>so these are interesting things that<br>marianne was able to discover with her<br>stud ongoing studies<br>all of the information that we've<br>learned so far about hazard maps from<br>new zealand and overseas is being<br>combined in a reasonably new study<br>that's being led by danielle<br>charlton to create a volcanic hazard<br>framework for new zealand<br>and she's combining more fundamental<br>geological<br>information with more social science and<br>and what we could call<br>arts information communication<br>cartography<br>into this framework and part of the<br>reason is there's lots of different ways<br>we create hazard maps in new zealand<br>there's no<br>sort of formula so she and there is no<br>formula i should say but<br>you it is possible to create a framework<br>a method for creating these maps these<br>are just some examples of the types of<br>maps we have in new zealand<br>it's a big ongoing collaboration that<br>involves talking to the people that<br>might use the maps<br>so all of any stakeholder that you can<br>think of including the media<br>etc and we've applied this approach<br>already<br>to long-term hazard map development<br>so danielle worked on generating an<br>update<br>of four maps from the tongariro national<br>park and here's an example of one of<br>them<br>from whakapapa and this just shows some<br>of the steps and the things that you<br>have to think about<br>when you're creating a hazard map and<br>here's a picture of this<br>final hazard map at wakapapa at the<br>information center<br>down at ruapehu and<br>this was in collaboration with people<br>such as doc<br>gns science ski field operators we also<br>worked on<br>a short-term map development project<br>creating hazard maps for fakari white<br>island<br>during the eruption now in 2019 and when<br>i say short term this really was<br>short term we had less than two hours to<br>create<br>a hazard map for the very first day we<br>were<br>invited to participate we were given<br>this particular map<br>which is a map that shows<br>risk to life of going to<br>white island for a particular period of<br>time and it was used internally<br>for gns science employees to decide<br>whether or not to go to the island on<br>any particular day<br>and this is a process that they use<br>they've used for years<br>but during the recent eruption<br>it became important to convey that<br>information more broadly<br>and genus science wanted to show a<br>version of this map at their briefings<br>to police and to emergency managers so<br>danielle and i and collaborators we<br>collaborated with nima<br>the old ministry of civil defence and<br>emergency management<br>and also juliette gerard and others at<br>junior science to create this map<br>which is the same information as this<br>map but much easier to understand<br>the map was taken up and shown in the<br>media presented at briefings<br>on social media etc and we had to<br>produ i should when i say we it was<br>mostly danielle<br>but we produced these sort of every day<br>for a period<br>during the eruption so some insights<br>from the antilles<br>and beyond again the same information<br>can be presented on a hazard map in many<br>different ways<br>but visualization choices can influence<br>how users interpret maps and the actions<br>they take<br>this is just a schematic showing<br>five different maps that show the same<br>data<br>it's important to consult with your<br>potential map users<br>or it doesn't have to be map users your<br>communication product whatever it might<br>be throughout the process to ensure that<br>the map or communication product<br>meets the user needs and is understood<br>so<br>user-centered approach right so we're<br>on to our third stop in our whistle-stop<br>tour we're off to auckland now<br>hopefully we all know where auckland is<br>since we're here<br>the auckland volcanic field is part of a<br>series of<br>similar fields but the other ones are<br>all older that extend from<br>the bay of islands kaikohe bay of<br>islands down here<br>towards okete and what we call<br>monogenetic<br>volcanic fields so that means when a new<br>batch of magma<br>rises to the surface it forms a new<br>volcano it doesn't pop up in the same<br>place like<br>at polygenetic volcanoes where like<br>taranaki where the magma comes up and<br>pops out at the same<br>vent more or less every time there's a<br>couple examples of the volcanoes in<br>auckland<br>te hopua and mount wellington<br>much of my research in auckland has been<br>done in the context of the<br>devorah project determining volcanic<br>risk in auckland<br>this is a collaboration funded by the<br>earthquake commission and auckland<br>council<br>has lots of different partners many of<br>whom are here today<br>it's a transdisciplinary research<br>program it involves close collaboration<br>with stakeholders<br>and there's geology focus hazard focus<br>risk and impact focus and all that data<br>is merged together<br>in an attempt to make auckland a safer<br>place and to improve<br>risk management practices in auckland<br>for volcanic activity the field is shown<br>here in this map<br>there's about 53 small centres<br>here are some some more examples orake<br>basin<br>the letters refer to the map over here<br>mount eden<br>moto korea browns island and it's<br>completely coincident with the city of<br>auckland<br>some of the things i've been<br>particularly interested in and<br>specifically involved in research with<br>is dating of the volcanoes that means<br>working out how old they are<br>so we use a mixture of techniques to<br>date the volcanoes we use radiocarbon<br>dating argon argon dating<br>tephra chronology which is basically<br>drilling<br>holes through previous explosion craters<br>like this example at hopua<br>and pulling up a core and then finding<br>tephra layers in that core<br>and little ash layers and correlate<br>dating them and correlating them<br>and ola another phd student worked on<br>this<br>aspect and was able to<br>work out not only how old some of the<br>volcanoes in auckland were but also<br>by finding ash from volcanoes from<br>elsewhere<br>from the central north island and<br>taranaki she was able to work out how<br>often<br>ash falls on auckland from other<br>volcanoes just<br>so for an example about every 3000 years<br>there's a<br>dumping of ash from the okataina<br>volcanic center<br>taranaki every time there's an eruption<br>at taranaki at least in the last 10<br>thousand years ash has tended to reach<br>auckland<br>from the auckland volcanic field about<br>once every three thousand years<br>and this and the total of all sources<br>combined once every four hundred years<br>there is a tefra ash fall in auckland<br>that<br>leaves a preservable measurable layer<br>in our lakes and lake pupuke for example<br>which is where she did most of her work<br>so we know the oldest volcano is pupuki<br>we know the youngest is rangitoto about<br>600 years old<br>and this is ongoing work so this<br>work was done a few years ago and we've<br>refined it a little bit since then<br>i'm also interested in where the magmas<br>come from and to work that out you have<br>to<br>look at the geochemistry of lava<br>and other products from the auckland<br>volcanic field<br>and this is my phd student lucy and lucy<br>worked with n<br>smith and myself and others<br>taking apart all of the volcanoes in<br>auckland to try and work out where they<br>came from<br>and how the magmas evolved and she was<br>able to show<br>that most of the magmas come from about<br>80 kilometers deep<br>in a part of the mantle called the<br>asthenosphere some of them<br>uh sourced a little bit shallower from<br>about 75<br>kilometers sorry 65 kilometers deep<br>and she was also able to show that um<br>the shallower the magmas were the bigger<br>the volcanoes so that was kind of cool<br>and elaine smith a current phd student<br>is carrying on this work<br>there she is in the back by looking at<br>teeny tiny little melt inclusions and<br>olivine crystals<br>and these are really tiny like this<br>scale here is 200 microns which is 0.2<br>millimeters just that little bar there<br>so these are tiny and elaine is hoping<br>to get a handle on how fast<br>the magmas move up to the surface this<br>is really really important<br>i'm also interested in what controls the<br>locations of our volcanoes<br>remember i said every batch of magma<br>forms a new<br>vent well where is that vent and is<br>anything<br>controlling where it is i've done some<br>work<br>with collaborators looking to see if<br>there are any sort of buried<br>folds and these are sort of structures<br>in the earth<br>where the earth moves against each other<br>they generate earthquakes if they're<br>active<br>and this is a map showing a whole bunch<br>of line green lines of proposed folds<br>that may exist buried beneath the<br>auckland volcanic field and most vents<br>seem to be within about 500 meters of<br>these features<br>suggesting that maybe they do have some<br>control<br>on where the magma finally comes out at<br>the surface<br>this is just a little diagram showing<br>that we know this happens elsewhere in<br>the world<br>this is what's called a dyke it's an<br>intrusion of magma that's come out at<br>the surface along a fault<br>and this is what it looks like in a<br>little schematic<br>so my student nico nico worked with<br>jr and myself looking at various things<br>but one of the things was to see<br>if he could recreate one of these dikes<br>moving up towards the surface<br>using gelatine and an air bubble so we<br>created a magma chamber out of gelatins<br>cut some faults using a knife and then<br>put little air bubbles in the bottom<br>to represent magma and watch what<br>happened to the air bubbles as they rose<br>up to the surface<br>and if there was an inclined fault the<br>air bubbles kind of moved towards it but<br>if it was a vertical fault<br>the bubbles just ignored the fault so<br>that might tell us something about what<br>happens when magma gets close to faults<br>as they approach the surface we<br>summarized all this information into a<br>geological model for auckland<br>the magmas originate down here at about<br>70 to 90 kilometers depth they move up<br>through the mantle<br>sometimes triggering that shallower<br>melting up here<br>they may pond at the crust mantle<br>boundary which is about 25 to 30<br>kilometers deep<br>and then they seem to enter the crust uh<br>in a crustal weak zone which we<br>sometimes refer to as the dun mountain<br>ophiolite belt it's just a suture<br>in the basement where two basement<br>terrains are sutured together<br>and it's a zone of weakness and then as<br>they reach the surface<br>they may use these shallower faults to<br>work out where the where they're going<br>to pop up<br>at the at the very top loads of open<br>questions<br>why does the mantle melt we're not<br>really sure what triggers the ascent and<br>how fast will it rise<br>are we missing some volcanoes have there<br>been any eruptions that have failed as<br>in<br>magma makes its way up and then stops<br>and why is rangitoto so big<br>so i'm also interested in<br>what are the hazards the phenomena that<br>might occur if<br>auckland erupts again we know that these<br>are the main<br>hazards to expect the edifice formation<br>the actual volcano itself<br>base surges which are fast moving clouds<br>of ash gases and debris<br>tephra fall ash ballistics these are<br>photographs showing examples of these<br>hazards from elsewhere<br>lava flows hawaii and iceland now<br>are great analogues for for lava flows<br>and<br>gases the hazards in auckland<br>are linked to eruption style so<br>these craters that are all over auckland<br>you probably don't know but<br>some of the parks that you visit only<br>poto domain they're all volcanoes one<br>not all of them but<br>some of them are this is odaike basin<br>these particular volcanoes occur the<br>holes on the ground occur when magma<br>interacts with water<br>so here's an analog from alaska they<br>produce these explosive eruptions<br>and um sort of a bit of a hole in the<br>ground an explosion crater<br>the scoria cones peppered around<br>auckland formed by this more<br>less violent fire fountaining an example<br>here from jaime<br>in iceland so<br>if there's water present we're going to<br>get more explosive eruptions<br>and there are soft sediments that are<br>um in the south part of auckland shown<br>here in this brown<br>color which are more which is<br>an area where we have had more of these<br>sort of freato magmatic we call them<br>eruptions in the past<br>and where probably we would expect<br>that type of eruption in the future also<br>there's a lot of water<br>in auckland right there's more water<br>around at the moment than there was in<br>the past<br>because sea levels have risen and gabor<br>one of my phd students worked on this to<br>try and work out which areas of auckland<br>might be more susceptible to different<br>types of eruptions<br>and javier also another phd student<br>looked at<br>individual volcanoes to work out what<br>the past eruptions looked like and<br>here's an example moto korea started out<br>with one of these style eruptions these<br>friata magmatic eruptions creating a<br>tough ring<br>and then moved when the water<br>disappeared when the water was exhausted<br>moved to ascoria cone and then lava<br>flows at the end of the eruption<br>here's a lovely slide that shows why<br>should we care<br>it's from angela doherty at auckland<br>council emergency management<br>and this shows the auckland the area of<br>the auckland volcanic field<br>the major highways the railways the<br>national power grid<br>the fuel pipeline airport the port<br>and you know if it's if it's not<br>infrastructure that rocks your boat here<br>all the children's schools retirement<br>communities<br>hospitals ambulance police stations<br>there it is and our volcanoes and their<br>deposits are<br>basically completely coincident with<br>with all of this infrastructure<br>so clearly if there's an eruption in the<br>future<br>we need to be prepared for it right so<br>what are some of the<br>impacts that might happen if we have a<br>future eruption<br>well those base surges that are<br>generated from<br>pyroclastic surges are quite destructive<br>and if you go to maungatakitaki which is<br>a volcano out near the airport<br>and you wander along the the coastline<br>here<br>here's renton road where you can park<br>i'm not sure if you can go there at the<br>moment but<br>if you walk along here it looks like<br>this and what you see<br>is a series of base surge deposits with<br>holes where trees used to be and in some<br>cases the trees are still there<br>and the trees have been knocked over and<br>it's possible to look at those trees<br>that have been knocked over to work out<br>how<br>how powerful that eruption was and we<br>believe that there would be complete<br>destruction out to 2.5 kilometers from<br>the vent if this particular type of<br>phenomenon occurred again<br>and then moderate damage up to six<br>tephra is another hazard so ash is<br>another hazard that we're likely to have<br>and this is a study by<br>daniel a phd student which showed how<br>much ash you'd have to dump on road<br>markings before you can't see them<br>anymore<br>that would cause a problem the main<br>damage from an eruption scenario this is<br>a scenario<br>a fake eruption in the auckland volcanic<br>field<br>is caused to transportation networks in<br>this particular case it's caused by the<br>pyroclastic surges<br>but the most extensive service<br>disruption is caused actually by the<br>evacuation of a whole lot of people out<br>of the evacuation zones<br>in this particular scenario<br>up to 435 000 residents<br>this diagram just shows the<br>transportation networks and a scenario<br>vent<br>that daniel worked on lava flows<br>my student sophia has worked on lava<br>flow hazard and impacts and she was<br>interested in the impacts on buried<br>infrastructure<br>so she did an experiment she created<br>lava<br>and poured it down a tube to see<br>how hot the ground got underneath that<br>lava<br>and how long it took for the ground to<br>heat up and she used this to constrain a<br>heat transfer<br>model so she was able to model under a<br>hypothetical lava flow<br>how deep you would have to bury cables<br>infrastructure cables<br>electricity cables or water cables in<br>order for them to be safe<br>from the heat generated from lava flows<br>and here's an example of a run that she<br>did<br>for auckland an auckland hypothetical<br>auckland lava flow<br>for example after a week um<br>the top two metres um the cables would<br>be inoperable<br>if they were in that zone and after six<br>months<br>the heat had transferred deep enough<br>that you couldn't do everything<br>within the top five meters would be<br>inoperable<br>so we do a number of things to plan for<br>an avf eruption so no<br>no need to panic we have a monitoring<br>network run by geonet<br>here's all of the stations and the gnet<br>monitoring network but we have a problem<br>and that auckland's really noisy<br>so there's lots and lots of noise so<br>seismic<br>stations on the surface pick up a whole<br>lot of<br>noise this little diagram here shows<br>seismic signals<br>in a day night pattern you can see it<br>gets noisy during the day and quiet at<br>night noisy during the day quiet at<br>night<br>the weekends are a little bit quieter<br>overall you can even see morning tea<br>afternoon tea it's really noisy<br>but if you put seismometers down deep<br>holes down boreholes<br>you can pick up earthquakes easier<br>because you don't have so much noise<br>so here's an example of one of these<br>borehole seismometers that we put down a<br>hole in riverhead<br>that we found which is out near where i<br>live<br>we've also created a series of scenarios<br>because we don't know where the next<br>event's going to be it's actually quite<br>good to have a suite of scenarios so<br>that you can<br>actually pretend what would happen and<br>then<br>do an impact assessment for example so<br>here's a suite of scenarios<br>this is a photoshopped image of a<br>pretend auckland eruption<br>that we used during the exercise romoko<br>which was a big national disaster<br>exercise back in 2008<br>we also try and develop tools that might<br>help decision makers make<br>decisions for example this is a<br>probabilistic forecasting tool that<br>shows the areas<br>most likely to be impacted by a base<br>surge<br>in the initial stages of that exercise<br>romoco that we ran<br>and i ran the tool during that exercise<br>to see<br>what the pro what the outcome would look<br>like<br>and my student alec wilde has carried on<br>this work<br>he's taking it to a whole new level<br>looking at<br>well if we have the hazard information<br>and we also have<br>an idea of what elements of society are<br>potentially impacted by that<br>we can calculate a risk um calculate the<br>risk or the likely areas that would be<br>affected<br>and come up with some sort of cost<br>benefit analysis for evacuation<br>which areas are most cost beneficial to<br>evacuate and when would you make that<br>decision<br>a final slide on devorah some of the<br>wider impacts have of devorah have been<br>a long-lived outreach program and<br>several people in the audience have been<br>involved in that<br>it's been excellent um<br>an excellent collaborative effort with<br>fact sheets and<br>web pages and outreach activities we<br>even made a tea towel<br>with all the names of all the different<br>volcanoes on it and<br>devorah has also been a bit of a model<br>for other integrated geological hazard<br>and risk<br>programs that have developed since and<br>one of these<br>is the varitha program and i know doug<br>took five minutes to introduce me<br>so i've got five minutes left to talk<br>about my last stop on our tour<br>which is saudi arabia<br>so in about 2011 we started a three-year<br>project to do a similar<br>project like the dvorah project but in<br>saudi arabia because<br>there are lots of volcanoes in saudi<br>arabia<br>and the aim was to acquire new data<br>from one of these volcanic fields in<br>saudi arabia called<br>rahat and develop probabilistic hazard<br>models to try and work out where the<br>next vent might be<br>and also to work out what the impacts<br>might be of an eruption<br>on the city of al medina here's a<br>photograph of some of the core team<br>during the early stages of the project<br>and kate who's here today and me in the<br>field<br>so here's a little map showing you where<br>we are we're just on the edge of the red<br>sea<br>um somewhere up here there's a<br>here's harat rahat which is one of these<br>big<br>um volcanic fields there's um<br>lots of volcanoes here there's almost a<br>thousand volcanoes in this particular<br>field<br>they're spectacular spectacular<br>volcanoes<br>this is a photograph of some of them<br>this<br>general zone of volcanism extends from<br>yemen all the way up to syria<br>it's one of the world's largest mostly<br>basaltic provinces the magmas<br>originate in the mantle too a bit like<br>auckland so quite deep<br>and the compositions range from basalt<br>like what we have in auckland all the<br>way through to more<br>viscous and silicic trackites which is<br>sort of a type of more silicic magma<br>so what we did is we worked mostly in<br>the northern part of this<br>harat which is the word for volcanic<br>field<br>and this sort of shows the area we<br>worked in the city of almadina<br>is located here right at the northern<br>part of this field<br>and that's why we and our collaborators<br>at king abdul aziz university<br>were so interested in this because<br>al-medina is a very special place<br>it's the burial place of the prophet<br>muhammad<br>so it's a very very special place and<br>it has a population of about the same as<br>auckland 1.5 million but they have over<br>3 million pilgrims annually<br>in a normal year the harat<br>itself is 300 kilometers long there's<br>about 960 different<br>vents from about 10 million years to<br>about 1256 a.d so there are a couple of<br>historical eruptions these little<br>stars here that means they've erupted<br>since people have been in the area<br>and there's also been a big earthquake<br>swarm there<br>which was probably a failed eruption<br>so one of the first things we did was to<br>look at the geology<br>of the past eruptions and that was led<br>by<br>hugo marcia one of my phd students he<br>studied all of these lava flows<br>all of these wonderful features to<br>understand how the eruptions progressed<br>and how often they erupted there's some<br>spectacular<br>features um in this area<br>and we also did a probabilistic hazard<br>assessment so we looked at the<br>patterns in space and time of past<br>eruptions<br>and this was led by mel another phd<br>student<br>one of the cool things she did was to<br>say okay there might be<br>968 vins but some of them are from the<br>same eruption<br>so she developed this cool method for<br>collapsing<br>vents into events<br>and that was one of the really cool<br>outcomes of her phd and then she also<br>worked out where the areas were that<br>were most likely to have a future<br>eruption<br>and this is what that is showing here<br>these red areas<br>are those areas likely to erupt next and<br>here's the city of<br>of medina we also<br>did some geophysics we did a<br>magnetotoluric survey<br>to measure um what was beneath the<br>surface to see if we could detect any<br>magma and sure enough there's a<br>a low resistivity zone just to the south<br>of medina which<br>may indicate magma<br>and we also installed a borehole seismic<br>network to monitor the area but also to<br>get an idea of the crust<br>so that's to measure earthquakes and<br>kate kennedy kate lewis<br>managed that aspect of the project<br>here's one of the<br>the drill sites for putting down one of<br>the boreholes<br>we combined all of that information and<br>developed a series of scenarios<br>so here's the scenario vent this uh<br>sorry this red one<br>this shows the area of medina this blue<br>area these are the two historical<br>eruptions here's the earthquake swarm<br>here's the probabilistic hazard<br>assessment showing that this area could<br>erupt again here's the historical<br>earthquake swarm<br>all of that stuff was combined into this<br>okay let's put a vent here it's<br>realistic<br>and then let's model some hazards that<br>might happen<br>if that volcano erupted in the style of<br>the most<br>recent eruption which occurred in 1256<br>a.d<br>and the red shows the lava flows the<br>white shows the tephra<br>falling on medina and we did an impact<br>assessment and some of the outcomes<br>uh for example lava flows would knock<br>out 52 kilometers of highways<br>28 pylons and five water wells and<br>tephra would cover<br>89 kilometers of road and likely cause<br>airport closures<br>so all of that information was combined<br>into that um<br>scenario a series of scenarios that's<br>just one of them a couple of slides just<br>to show what field work is like<br>if you're very well looked after in<br>saudi arabia this was<br>not all of our field work was like this<br>but this was associated with the<br>conference that we attended<br>and a few people that were there in the<br>audience today<br>so we had a convoy of cars we arrived at<br>locations where lunch was to be served<br>and there were<br>big marquees and carpeted floors and<br>amazing food we were taken on a<br>helicopter ride across the volcanoes<br>had tea it was quite spectacular<br>it was also very interesting being a<br>woman working in saudi arabia<br>so just a couple of insights um kate and<br>mel and i were the<br>three women that were involved in this<br>project we had to wear it in a buyer<br>for most of the time we<br>looked longingly at the swimming pool<br>out our hotel<br>window but we're not allowed to swim in<br>it as woman<br>we attended this conference that i<br>mentioned before which was the golf<br>seismic forum in 2012<br>and i was one of three women speakers at<br>the conference there were well over 200<br>participants and we sat down for the<br>opening ceremony<br>on the other side of the screen with our<br>colleagues our male colleagues and we<br>were politely<br>told to move by soldiers to behind the<br>screen<br>so we had to witness the opening<br>ceremony of the conference in the<br>women's area which was behind a screen<br>screened off from the men<br>and we watched it on a video screen so<br>you can imagine<br>it was quite it was extremely<br>interesting<br>working over there<br>and you never quite knew what was coming<br>next<br>so some insights from these distributed<br>volcanic fields in auckland<br>and saudi arabia in these fields where<br>you don't know where the location of the<br>next vent is going to be<br>in addition to those detailed<br>spatio-temporal probability estimates of<br>where the next vent might be<br>it's really good to develop scenarios um<br>realistic scenarios of future eruptions<br>to inform impact assessments and also<br>emergency management plans because it's<br>something concrete<br>that people can look at and say if the<br>event's here this is what would happen<br>and working with stakeholders in the<br>broadest sense of the word in fact<br>factoring in translational outputs like<br>web design<br>policy briefs fact sheets into your<br>hazard and risk research project really<br>increases the chance that the<br>research is useful and used and this is<br>a little artist's impression of an<br>auckland volcanic field eruption<br>that's not where the next vents going to<br>be<br>and so this is my final slide just<br>reflecting on that little framework that<br>i showed<br>in the very beginning after that<br>overview of my research<br>including the research of every single<br>one of my phd students and postdocs<br>which i managed to squeeze into the talk<br>i think collectively we've improved<br>understanding of magnitude frequency<br>relationships and<br>the hazards to expect at volcanoes in<br>the andes the lesser antilles<br>auckland saudi arabia we've also managed<br>to improve our understanding of how<br>certain elements of society are<br>vulnerable to specific hazards like lava<br>flows<br>and also improved understanding of how<br>communication of hazard and risk<br>affects people's understanding of the<br>messages and their behaviour<br>all of that to inform measures to reduce<br>our vulnerability<br>to volcanic eruptions like hazard maps<br>monitoring networks<br>evacuation plans and thus reduce risk<br>we probably have time for one burning<br>burning's a bit of a partner here<br>no in that case it reminds me to thank<br>you</p></main><footer
