In 2020 only about 20 percent of the New Zealand’s medical graduates, who started study in 2014, entered general practice.<br><br>In Canada when the figure of medical graduates entering general practice reached 25 percent the red flags went up and there was intervention by the Canadian Government to correct the decline.<br><br>Professor Strasser’s work at the Northern Ontario School of Medicine showed the impact of the establishment of the rural medical school. 95 percent of NOSM MD graduates chose generalist medical careers, and 94 percent of the doctors who completed both undergraduate and postgraduate training in Northern Ontario are practising in the region. In addition, there has been substantial economic impact and social impact in this previously socially and economically under-resourced region.<br><br>Professor Strasser says it is an example New Zealand can learn from.<br><br>https://waikato.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=9735cd79efa925d5756daa13b&id=312982d2a6</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may

so<br>it's wonderful to see you all here and i<br>must say it is really wonderful<br>for me uh to be here in new zealand<br>actually<br>tomorrow marks six months<br>since uh my wife professor sarah<br>strasser who's here she's the dean of<br>the<br>tehuataki wayara school of health and<br>and<br>so she and i had completed our<br>two weeks of hotel isolation and we set<br>foot in new zealand<br>two weeks ago tomorrow i mean two months<br>six months ago tomorrow<br>and that was after six months almost of<br>of<br>being locked down working from home in<br>australia so it certainly is wonderful<br>to be here<br>and i really appreciate the opportunity<br>to to talk with you today<br>about rural medical education and how<br>rural medical education<br>helps improve healthcare for all what<br>i'm going to do<br>is first of all explore<br>healthcare and what we expect of<br>healthcare people everywhere expect of<br>healthcare and then look at the<br>realities of<br>rural health then i'm going to talk<br>about medical education and<br>and developments in the last 100 years<br>but including of course rural medical<br>education<br>and then i'm going to introduce you to<br>the northern ontario school of medicine<br>which is a<br>new medical school relatively new<br>medical school in<br>in rural canada so what do we expect<br>what if if you think about it what what<br>do you expect what do we expect of of<br>health care and i would say<br>people everywhere expect high quality<br>health care<br>close to home in other words accessible<br>health care we expect that if we're<br>unlucky enough to be seriously ill or<br>injured<br>then the system is there to save us<br>and of course we expect care for<br>all kinds of of health problems acute<br>and chronic health problems<br>and that the system is encouraging<br>promoting good health<br>for for everybody and and with a focus<br>on on the needs of individuals<br>as part of society so i'd suggest that's<br>that's what we expect of health care<br>so what's the situation for rural health<br>and i would say that it was something of<br>a surprise to us back in 1996<br>it was about 300 of us for rural<br>practitioners from 30 different<br>countries we came together<br>in china for the what became the first<br>world rural health conference<br>and we found that even though there's so<br>many obvious differences from one<br>country<br>to another in terms of of geography<br>and and and climate and economic<br>development levels and so on<br>there are some very common themes that<br>are true<br>around the world access is the rural<br>health issue<br>even in countries where most of the<br>people live in rural areas<br>the resources are concentrated in the<br>cities<br>there are always transport and<br>communication difficulties between one<br>rural area and another and certainly<br>between the rural areas<br>and and the urban areas and there are<br>never enough<br>uh health workforce so that was<br>something we discovered when we came<br>together<br>back in 1996. over the last two decades<br>there's<br>evidence really accumulated that's shown<br>that people living in<br>rural and remote parts of the world<br>generally<br>their health status is worse than people<br>living in the cities<br>so what about the health care providers<br>the rural practitioners when compared to<br>their<br>their city counterparts rural<br>practitioners<br>provide a wider range of services carry<br>a higher level of clinical<br>responsibility<br>in relative professional isolation<br>and that's true talking about not just<br>doctors but<br>all the specialties in medicine so<br>general practitioners<br>surgeons pediatricians it's also true<br>talking about other<br>health professionals like nurses and<br>pharmacists and physiotherapists<br>and because most rural practitioners<br>or often rural practitioners live in the<br>community they serve<br>they have the opportunity to influence<br>the health of the whole community not<br>just in terms of individual interactions<br>with<br>with people as patients and and families<br>but the whole community level and<br>actually the best<br>example that i know of that is a doctor<br>in a small<br>country town in inland south australia<br>who was so effective in presenting the<br>message of the connection between red<br>meat and cholesterol<br>and heart disease that the butcher shop<br>so what about health services for people<br>living in in rural communities i've<br>already<br>highlighted that access is is the issue<br>and i've mentioned uh the safety net<br>that we all have a security need<br>really wherever we live now in the<br>cities of course<br>there are ambulances and emergency<br>departments and so<br>you know it's no it's not a big issue<br>really you'd like to think anyway but in<br>rural areas<br>that that safety net<br>can't be taken for granted and so there<br>is a preoccupation with<br>doctors and hospitals and amongst people<br>living in rural areas<br>there's also a desire to be looked after<br>by people they know<br>close to home and it certainly can't be<br>assumed<br>that people living in remote rural<br>communities actually will travel<br>i mean i i was in rural practice<br>in australia for nearly two decades and<br>twice i had people choose to go blind<br>rather than travel two hours to the<br>nearest eye specialist<br>i mentioned already the limited<br>resources and and and the<br>shortage of workforce but i think the<br>bottom line is that<br>taking models of health service<br>delivery from the cities and somehow<br>trying to sort of<br>modify them and make them fit in the<br>rural areas doesn't work<br>the health services that work best for<br>rural communities<br>are those the models that are developed<br>in the community by the community<br>for the community so how does this<br>relate to new zealand<br>well last year there was the<br>simpson report the health and disability<br>system review<br>report and what you know people living<br>in<br>rural towns have a poorer health status<br>including lower life expectancy than<br>people living the cities<br>or the surrounding districts of the<br>cities and that's even more so<br>for maori and disabled people i think<br>they didn't really look at pacific but<br>it's true for pacific peoples<br>as well what about rural practitioners<br>well<br>in new zealand they have different roles<br>often a broader scope<br>of practice so the description that i've<br>given about<br>rural health and rural practice around<br>the world<br>is also true for new zealand<br>so let's move on to medical education<br>and it was in 1910<br>a chap called abraham flexner who was an<br>educationalist<br>present presented his report which was a<br>the result of a review of medical<br>education<br>in north america so the united states<br>and canada<br>and flexner recommended that<br>all medical education should be<br>university-based<br>and there should be the connection made<br>between science and medicine<br>so that the first half of the medical<br>education program<br>should occur at the university<br>and focused on the basic sciences<br>explanation to medicine<br>and then the second half of the medical<br>education program in the teaching<br>hospital<br>so i have to say of course in the united<br>states<br>the teaching hospital was a relatively<br>new phenomenon and and flexon knew about<br>johns hopkins university and medical<br>school and teaching hospital<br>which was actually modeled on the german<br>model of medical education so they've<br>been<br>teaching hospitals in europe for<br>centuries but it was a new idea<br>in north america and the reason that<br>flexner<br>particularly recommended that was that<br>that the doctors<br>the physicians in these teaching<br>hospitals use the scientific method both<br>in terms of their<br>their clinical care and and research<br>and so that's the the flexner model<br>became the standard model of medical<br>education for the world<br>partly because flexner produ presented<br>his report in new york then gone on a<br>ship and and presented his report in<br>london and then got another ship and<br>went to berlin and so<br>this model was adopted and spread around<br>the world<br>very very quickly and still is the<br>standard model of medical education<br>around the world but if you think about<br>teaching hospitals and and the<br>developments in the<br>20th century of science and technology<br>and<br>and uh and medical care and the use of<br>technology and specialties and<br>subspecialties<br>teaching hospitals have sort of grown<br>and developed and become this<br>this sort of huge edifice<br>really and become the temples<br>through which you must pass to become a<br>physician a sort of hallowed<br>place really in medical education<br>and it's true especially in the latter<br>part of the the 20th century<br>uh they were introduced various<br>rotations away from the teaching<br>hospital into other hospitals and<br>sometimes into other<br>settings that we call community but<br>there was this sense that it's kind of a<br>bit like a school excursion<br>it's a fun thing to do but it doesn't<br>really count for anything<br>and meanwhile uh the the principal<br>uh the leadership in the in the teaching<br>hospitals are sub-specialists and they<br>are the principal clinical teachers and<br>role models<br>for the medical students and so wouldn't<br>you know it<br>most medical students when they graduate<br>they aspire to become<br>teaching hospital sub specialists and we<br>can<br>reflect on the implications of that but<br>in terms of<br>in terms of medical education there's<br>another problem<br>and when you think about it by the end<br>of the 20th<br>20th century certainly now in the 21st<br>century you have to be<br>really sick or have a rare disease or<br>require some high technology<br>intervention to make it into a teaching<br>hospital<br>and therefore and often patients don't<br>stay very long<br>because it's so expensive to keep<br>patients in teaching hospitals<br>and so the effect of that is that<br>medical students have a very limited<br>exposure and and this particular<br>graph really emphasizes that so um<br>this is a research that was done<br>actually first in 1961 and<br>then repeated in and published in 2001<br>in the new england medical journal<br>and so it says well a thousand people<br>about 750 have symptoms and and seek<br>medical attention<br>one or actually less than one makes it<br>into a teaching hospital<br>so that's another way in which the the<br>clinical<br>experience exposure to the range of of<br>health problems that people experience<br>is very limited where where the medical<br>school is really sticking to the<br>so what about new zealand well new<br>zealand has two universities<br>or two medical schools associated with<br>two universities<br>and uh because of the the the concern<br>about<br>uh the shortage of doctors and and the<br>need for more doctors to<br>uh to serve the populations in new<br>zealand there was an increase<br>of 30 percent in the output of these<br>medical schools over<br>the last 10 years or 30 increase<br>unfortunately hasn't really made much of<br>a difference if you're<br>if you're a community member and looking<br>for a general practitioner<br>especially uh in in rural communities so<br>only 20 percent of new zealand graduates<br>train to be general practitioners it's<br>even worse<br>in terms three percent go into<br>psychiatry<br>and very few new zealand graduates<br>choose to serve people living in remote<br>rural<br>marine pacific communities<br>and another issue is that training for<br>general practice and for public<br>health is is a within new zealand<br>enterprise but all of the other training<br>programs for all of the other<br>specialties<br>are overseen by colleges that cover<br>australia<br>and new zealand so australasian or<br>australian new zealand colleges<br>and so many recent graduates in new<br>zealand medical graduates<br>go to australia to pursue further<br>training<br>often more attractive training positions<br>and better pay and some of them come<br>back but many of them don't so we have<br>something like a 20 attrition rate which<br>does include retirements<br>amongst new zealand trained doctors and<br>in fact new zealand<br>has never been self-sufficient for<br>doctors never produce enough doctors to<br>meet the needs of new zealand has always<br>relied on<br>overseas trained doctors or<br>international medical graduates and<br>in round figures about 40 of the new<br>doctors entering<br>practice each year in new zealand are<br>come from other countries<br>and that of course raises questions<br>especially serving people in<br>in maori and pacific and rural<br>communities about<br>cultural competency there's also the<br>fact that<br>many of them don't stay in new zealand<br>they may stay for some years<br>do some further training higher<br>qualifications and then they move on<br>to other countries sometimes australia<br>sometimes back to where they came from<br>so relying on on overseas trained<br>doctors is not a really<br>a winning formula shall we say for new<br>zealand<br>so what about rural medical education<br>well<br>i've described the standard model and by<br>the<br>the sort of latter half of the 20th<br>century there was a growing concern in<br>many<br>many countries uh that there weren't<br>enough rural doctors and<br>and the new graduates weren't choosing<br>uh rural practice and so let that lead<br>to the idea that maybe<br>if the medical students had some<br>experience in rural practice<br>they would actually decide to become<br>rural practitioners and in fact it was<br>the legislature in minnesota the state<br>of minnesota in the united states that<br>really<br>brought this on because they threatened<br>to cut the funding to the<br>university of minnesota medical school<br>unless they produce more rural doctors<br>and then that the minnesota university<br>of minnesota took the plunge and and<br>started<br>sending not many but a small number of<br>their medical students out to to have a<br>whole year living<br>and learning in rural communities that's<br>that program continues to this day it's<br>called the rural physicians associates<br>program<br>and it's been a great success and so now<br>we know<br>that that idea actually is true there's<br>been a lot of research that shows<br>that prolonged especially prolonged<br>immersive experience clinical experience<br>in in rural communities increases the<br>likelihood of<br>of the the doctor choosing rural<br>practice as their career<br>so the research also now we know that<br>rural practitioners require a specific<br>range of knowledge and skills and so<br>that's lead to curriculum development<br>around<br>rural medical education and it's also<br>very clear now<br>that whatever future career path a<br>medical student might<br>be heading towards the rural setting is<br>a great place to learn<br>clinical medicine because the students<br>see a wide range of clinical problems<br>they get much<br>much more hands-on experience and so<br>they they actually develop more quickly<br>a higher level of clinical knowledge<br>and skills confidence and competence<br>so that's a quick window on medical<br>education and rural medical education<br>i know i want to go to canada let's talk<br>about canada so you probably recognize<br>the<br>the map of canada um and and you'll see<br>uh that there's two red dots that's a<br>place called thunder bay<br>and that's a place called sudbury<br>they're both sort of similar to hamilton<br>in terms of<br>a population or a thousand kilometers<br>apart and this is on<br>the province of ontario and this part<br>here is<br>northern ontario so looking at at this<br>map<br>uh you can see that that northern<br>ontario these are these are great lakes<br>here and this is hudson bay and james<br>bay<br>and northern ontario is this land masses<br>between them northern ontario is vast<br>geographic area this this map actually<br>is showing the population distribution<br>and and you can see that uh so black is<br>sparsely populated<br>there are five population centers<br>greater than fifty thousand<br>uh and most of the communities are ten<br>thousand or less so<br>a lot of small communities and the the<br>uh the economy is is resource-based so<br>mining forestry tourism are the main<br>uh the main industries in northern<br>ontario they've never had enough doctors<br>or<br>other health professionals and the<br>health status of the people of northern<br>ontario is worse than<br>the general population of canada<br>so just to put this in perspective<br>here's new zealand<br>so on this map<br>instead of black it's green but so the<br>dark green and the slightly lighter<br>green<br>that's sparse sparse population and red<br>is the is the<br>is the high density population<br>and northern ontario has something just<br>under 800 000<br>population the rural and remote parts<br>outside the larger<br>uh the the main centers and the larger<br>cities of new zealand it's roughly 800<br>000 population<br>so new zealand isn't as different from<br>northern ontario as you might think<br>but let's talk about northern ontario so<br>back in 2000 and 2001<br>people right across northern ontario<br>said<br>we'll when if we're ever going to have<br>enough doctors and other<br>health professionals if we're ever going<br>to improve the health of the people of<br>northern ontario<br>we know we need our own standalone<br>northern ontario school of medicine and<br>i'm pleased to say that<br>the the ontario government of the day<br>actually accepted that proposition and<br>decided to establish the school and and<br>that led to sarah and<br>and and me and our five children moving<br>from australia<br>to canada to join others in establishing<br>northern ontario school of medicine so<br>that was in 2002 it took three years to<br>go through the process of of developing<br>uh the school and and meeting the<br>accreditation requirements so the first<br>student started in 2005.<br>the school serves as the faculty of<br>medicine of two universities<br>lakewood university in thunder bay<br>laurentian university in<br>sudbury and they're a thousand<br>kilometers apart those those two<br>universities and the founding documents<br>that establish the school<br>actually set out the social<br>accountability mandate<br>which is to improve the health of the<br>people and the communities of northern<br>ontario<br>there's also a commitment to innovation<br>so i mentioned social accountability and<br>i think it's an important concept just<br>to dwell on<br>for a moment it was in 1995 that the<br>world health<br>organization defined the social<br>accountability of medical schools<br>and specifically that that socially<br>accountable medical schools<br>everything they do education research<br>and service<br>should be addressing the priority health<br>concerns of the population<br>that the school has a mandate to serve<br>so that's<br>social accountability now as<br>we were starting with northern ontario<br>school of medicine<br>we looked at the research evidence from<br>around the world<br>and and we saw that there are three<br>factors<br>that are most strongly associated with<br>going into rural practice after<br>education and training<br>the first is a rural upbringing that's<br>having grown up in a rural area<br>the second factor is positive clinical<br>and educational experiences in the rural<br>setting<br>positive clinical and educational<br>experiences in the rural setting as part<br>of the undergraduate education<br>and then after graduation training that<br>prepares the doctor to practice in<br>the rural setting so armed with that<br>evidence we went about<br>designing the program the edu the<br>curriculum and so on for the northern<br>ontario school of medicine<br>and the model that we developed is<br>distributed community<br>engaged learning so that's the<br>distinctive model of medical education<br>and health research<br>for the northern ontario school of<br>medicine distributed<br>means many many many sites actually over<br>90 9-0 sites<br>where the students and the trainees may<br>undertake part of their<br>their clinical learning now in order to<br>do that of course we rely heavily on<br>electronic communications and<br>essentially<br>if you have the internet you have access<br>to educational resources and information<br>pretty much the same as if in the big<br>city like in a teaching hospital<br>environment<br>but the centerpiece of distributed<br>community-engaged learning<br>is community engagement that's the<br>interdependent partnerships<br>with the communities of northern ontario<br>so the the co-creation<br>and and co-delivery of the curriculum of<br>the education<br>program so this is a<br>another map and i'm showing you it gives<br>you a visual of the over 90 sites<br>spread around northern ontario and some<br>beyond in the southern part of ontario<br>as well<br>and the color coding is a different uh<br>parts of our education program so for<br>example this sort of orangey<br>triangle which includes these<br>communities here these are remote fly<br>and fly out<br>first nation community so you can only<br>get there by airplane<br>except in the winter when they cut ice<br>roads so that's how they bring in heavy<br>equipment and<br>and the like so we asked<br>the uh the indigenous people in northern<br>ontario the first nations and the metis<br>people and we asked them well what what<br>are you<br>expecting of your medical school and we<br>we had a special<br>uh gathering over 100 indigenous people<br>from across<br>northern ontario and we and this was<br>held at a first nation<br>just in the in the far northwest of of<br>northern ontario<br>and and there were many recommendations<br>which then provided the basis for the<br>indigenous dimension of the school and<br>the first one was that all of the<br>students<br>should have an immersive cultural<br>experience in<br>the indigenous communities so in first<br>year all of the medical students<br>have four weeks living and learning in<br>the indigenous communities and they're<br>there to learn<br>from the community about the history the<br>tradition the culture<br>the social and the health issues of<br>those communities<br>and northern ontario school of<br>medicine's the only medical school in<br>the world where all of<br>the students have this cultural<br>immersion especially early on<br>in their education in second year<br>the students have two what we call<br>integrated community experiences in<br>these rural and remote communities so<br>these are clinical attachments they're<br>attached to the doctors and the health<br>team in the small communities usually<br>a population less than 5 000 and so<br>they're starting to<br>to learn not just about the the<br>community but also the<br>what they've been learning in the<br>classroom linking that to<br>uh to their um<br>to their future practice and then in<br>third year<br>uh the students they have what's called<br>the<br>comprehensive community clerkship the<br>students leave<br>thunder bay in sudbury and they move to<br>one of 15 other communities in northern<br>ontario and they live in that community<br>for the whole academic year<br>and and they learn their core clinical<br>medicine in<br>that community so this is the year when<br>the students make the transition from<br>being classroom learners<br>to clinicians and<br>the standard model the flexor model has<br>students in the teaching hospital<br>and what they do is they do a block<br>rotation in internal medicine and a<br>block rotation in surgery then a<br>blocking rotation and<br>pediatrics and so on northern ontario<br>school of medicine<br>the students are actually living in the<br>community and they're based in general<br>practice<br>and they see patients so you could say<br>the curriculum<br>walks through the door the first patient<br>might be a child that's pediatrics<br>the next patient might be pregnant<br>that's obstetrics the next patient might<br>have a surgical problem<br>so the learning outcomes for this year<br>the<br>comprehensive community clerkship are in<br>the six core clinical disciplines the<br>learning outcomes are just the same<br>as in the other medical schools<br>in canada but the learning environment<br>is very different<br>the students are learning their core<br>clinical medicine from the community<br>general practice perspective and it's<br>actually only<br>in their in their fourth year that which<br>is the finally so it's a four-year<br>graduate entry program uh the that the<br>students then have<br>uh direct teaching by the specialists<br>and sub-specialists in the in the<br>tertiary care hospitals in in sudbury<br>and in thunder bay<br>so as you can see very different uh<br>learning environment and curriculum<br>model from<br>from the the from the standard from the<br>flexner model<br>and there are many curriculum uh<br>innovations so<br>very much learning in context so even<br>the classroom with the case-based<br>learning<br>uh the cases are complex real-life<br>scenarios set in real northern ontario<br>communities and certainly in the<br>communities the the students are<br>learning<br>uh about the culture and and developing<br>uh cultural<br>competence but i think that i've<br>highlighted there the<br>the longitudinal learning and<br>uh and immersive community engaged<br>education<br>because i've come to realize that's<br>really that's that's the secret source<br>shall we say of of northern ontario<br>school of medicine<br>because it's intense interaction with<br>patients<br>that motivates the students to study<br>hard and to learn and to look after<br>their patients<br>so within two months those students are<br>talking about going to work rather than<br>going to study and<br>they're really part of the health team<br>so they<br>they're developing that social<br>accountability mindset focused on<br>the health needs of of their patients<br>and the population<br>they're serving the other secret<br>part of the secret source is that the<br>principal clinical teachers and role<br>models<br>for these students are rural generalists<br>general practitioners and other general<br>specialists and i think that that helps<br>to explain<br>the the outcomes which i'll come to<br>shortly but i just wanted to show you<br>this slide<br>that uh that gives you an<br>overview of all of the academic<br>activities of the school you can see<br>they're extensive you can see that<br>although the titleist medical school are<br>very much involved in producing a whole<br>range of members of the health<br>team with inter-professional education<br>and the research activities are guided<br>by social accountability<br>that is addressing research questions<br>the answer for which makes a difference<br>to the health of the people of northern<br>ontario<br>and i wanted to just draw your attention<br>to the top half of the slide<br>because if you look at that you can see<br>there's a life cycle<br>or the career pathway of of a doctor or<br>a<br>health professional in northern ontario<br>so the the science camps are<br>starting at high school level and going<br>through each stage of that pathway<br>and and i'm going to come back to this<br>concept but it's something that we've<br>realized is<br>is very important a very important<br>element so it's more than just the three<br>factors<br>associated with going to rural practice<br>it's connecting uh<br>the stages along the way so what about<br>the outcomes well<br>um<br>this is about the admissions process so<br>given what i said about the<br>the research evidence the rural<br>background etc<br>and the social accountability mandate we<br>set ourselves<br>the target of reflecting the population<br>distribution of northern ontario<br>in each class so a process that favors<br>applicants from northern ontario<br>and you can see on the one hand it's<br>very competitive over 2000 applications<br>each year for<br>64 places on the other hand we've been<br>successful<br>in recruiting students from northern<br>ontario 92 percent of the students have<br>grown up in northern ontario<br>the other eight percent come from remote<br>and rural parts of the rest of canada<br>40 from remote and rural communities is<br>about right<br>for the demographics of northern ontario<br>seven percent indigenous<br>is a bit low uh and so this was uh this<br>was a review after ten years and now<br>that we tweaked the selection admissions<br>process and it's up to 12<br>which does reflect the population<br>distribution and i wanted to highlight<br>one other aspect of the slide<br>which is this here this gpa stands for<br>grade point average<br>it's a number out of four and 3.7<br>is the same as the other medical schools<br>in canada when students are entering<br>medical school<br>so we haven't sacrificed academic<br>standards<br>to to well in toronto they would have<br>said to let in all these dumb<br>northerners<br>so what about the student experience<br>these are some some quotes from students<br>from different research that was<br>undertaken and<br>and you'll see uh you know for example<br>this one we're better off we actually<br>get to<br>to learn more being in the rural center<br>rather than in the big<br>teaching hospital but i think it's this<br>last one that i've highlighted that<br>really<br>sums it up you don't know it<br>until you live it you don't know it<br>until you live it and if that like<br>this is really the opposite of the<br>flexner model it's learning<br>in the community and clinical setting<br>where you expect that the doc the future<br>doctor<br>so what about the career directions well<br>i said i come back to that and here it<br>is<br>62 percent of the graduates have chosen<br>general practice that's mostly<br>a rural general practice training that<br>they've chosen<br>that's almost double the national<br>average for canada going into general<br>practice<br>for the other medical schools you may<br>recall<br>that new zealand is 20<br>of new zealand medical graduates go into<br>general practice<br>in canada when that figure got down to<br>25 percent<br>the alarm bells are ringing and the red<br>flags went up and government started<br>investing more<br>both in training and in making general<br>practice a more attractive<br>career direction for for doctors<br>the next uh the next<br>line in this slide says 33 general<br>specialties that's<br>62 plus 33 that's the 95 percent that<br>was mentioned in the introduction<br>so the general specialist at general<br>medicine general surgery pediatrics and<br>so on including psychiatry<br>and so 95 of the graduates have chosen<br>to be generalists in<br>in across the medical specialties the<br>other five percent other<br>going going into sub-specialties and<br>that five percent is really important to<br>us so we talk about dermatologists and<br>radiation oncologists and neurologist<br>that that's really important to us<br>because in northern ontario we need<br>those sub-specialists<br>yeah they have to go elsewhere for<br>training but they but they are coming<br>back<br>it's also important another way because<br>even though the the<br>learning environment curriculum model is<br>very different in northern ontario from<br>the other medical schools<br>our students or our graduates are really<br>competitive like there are<br>a small number of first-year training<br>positions in each of these sub<br>specially training programs each year<br>and essentially<br>if our uh if our students our graduates<br>choose that career pathway they're<br>successful in matching to those careers<br>there's a national match so the going<br>into<br>into postgraduate training in canada<br>and the first group of graduates from<br>the school they were all matched in the<br>first round that was the first time at<br>that time<br>for over 15 years that any for any<br>medical school in canada the whole class<br>will be matched in the first round<br>and that pattern has continued not every<br>year but most years for northern ontario<br>and<br>for other schools in canada there's now<br>concern that some canadian medical<br>graduates aren't getting into any<br>postgraduate training so<br>they're high quality graduates from<br>northern ontario school of medicine that<br>i sought after<br>to train in any specialty and<br>sub-specialty<br>the bottom half of the slide is looking<br>at then after<br>a post-graduate training and you can see<br>that those who<br>who who did their undergraduate and<br>their postgraduate training in northern<br>ontario 94<br>so what about the the impact of the<br>school more generally<br>on on the region on northern ontario and<br>we've done<br>uh research a couple of times now<br>looking at the economic impact and also<br>the social impact of the school<br>and in in 2017 the budget for the school<br>was 43 million dollars that's taxpayers<br>money<br>the level of new economic activity in<br>northern ontario<br>in that year was something over 120<br>million dollars<br>so it's more than a two-for-one<br>multiplier effect or<br>return on investment and this is this is<br>positive<br>not just for the larger population<br>centres<br>but also this benefit flows through to<br>the smaller communities and its economic<br>development so there are<br>job categories in northern ontario that<br>wouldn't be there without a medical<br>school<br>in terms of the social impact well first<br>of all<br>much greater success in recruitment and<br>and<br>retention of doctors and other members<br>of the health workforce we did a study<br>looking<br>at eight communities that before the<br>school<br>had 30 30 full-time equivalent vacancies<br>at the time of the study they had one<br>vacancy they'd gone from being in crisis<br>mode<br>trying to fill gaps next week and next<br>month to planning ahead and those<br>spending less money on recruitment<br>but i think probably the most important<br>social impact was this sense of<br>of of collective<br>community empowerment summed up by the<br>phrase<br>if we can do a successful medical school<br>so nelson northern ontario school of<br>medicine has<br>has actually provided many benefits to<br>northern ontario<br>more generalist doctors and other health<br>professionals who are members of the<br>health team and are<br>responsive to the the social and<br>cultural diversity of northern ontario<br>as well as the benefits of the research<br>and the<br>academic and the economic development as<br>well<br>i mentioned generalism a bit so i just<br>want to focus on this this is based on<br>research that we did studying<br>students and graduates of northern<br>ontario school of medicine about their<br>experience of generalism<br>in rural practice and and<br>this is the conclusion really from that<br>study that it's not<br>that somehow uh you know it's better to<br>be a specialist and sub-specialist with<br>the services i provide a better it's<br>different<br>and that that really rural generalist<br>care you know it's it's high quality<br>care<br>within the realities of the of the<br>geography demography cultural context<br>human material resources<br>of the rural communities and the other<br>important finding was<br>that the experiences of the students and<br>graduates actually helped them<br>to choose what career direction uh<br>what's<br>what specialty and the and the scope of<br>so lest you think that generalism is<br>just about<br>general practice this is the definition<br>of generalism coined by the royal<br>college of physicians and surgeons of<br>canada so that's all of the specialties<br>except general practice<br>and you can see that uh they<br>their definition is common in common<br>with others that it's about a wide range<br>of services<br>provided as part of a health team that's<br>focused on addressing<br>the health needs of the population<br>that's being served<br>so generalism is an important<br>concept really in all of this and going<br>a step further and<br>i i highlighted the on the top part of<br>the slide of the academic activities<br>with nossam in northern ontario is<br>what's<br>is actually now we have the research<br>evidence so more than the three factors<br>that we have the research evidence that<br>shows if you're really going to ensure<br>the supply<br>recruitment and retention of doctors and<br>health professionals in rural<br>communities<br>you need to have a facilitated career<br>pathway that starts at high school and<br>actually indigenous communities probably<br>even in starting in primary school<br>that's what we do in northern ontario<br>encouraging the young people to see a<br>future of them for themselves<br>which might include a career in<br>healthcare and studying medicine and so<br>it's<br>motivating and raising the<br>the bar so to speak the expectations of<br>young people in these<br>is remote rural and indigenous<br>communities<br>and then having a selection process that<br>favors applicants from those<br>communities and then provides most of<br>their their education actually in<br>those community and in clinical settings<br>after graduation and training that<br>prepares them<br>with including enhanced skills to serve<br>those<br>those rural communities as rural<br>generalists and then supporting them to<br>stay in those communities with with uh<br>continuing professional development<br>so let's come back to new zealand just<br>for a minute um<br>you know i've highlighted already that<br>uh<br>the the worse health status of people<br>living in rural maori pacific<br>communities in in new zealand and<br>relatively accident they're underserved<br>in terms of access<br>to care they're also underrepresented in<br>terms of the<br>uh medicine and other health professions<br>and so it seems to me that<br>that provides the the basis for new<br>zealand to at least explore<br>uh the notion of a new and different<br>medical school different from the<br>the standard model which is at auckland<br>and<br>and otago and one difference would be to<br>recruit students who already have a<br>university degree<br>and may have other life experience<br>before they've decided they really want<br>to study medicine<br>and then providing those students<br>who've come from the under represented<br>underserved<br>communities with most of their clinical<br>education so<br>immersive distributed community engaged<br>education in those rural and underserved<br>settings<br>so that's something i think is worth<br>thinking about for new zealand<br>and you can't these days do a<br>presentation<br>without mentioning covert 19 pandemic<br>um and that that certainly has made<br>a lot of differences it brought into<br>sharp focus so well already<br>known uh inequities and disparities for<br>rural and and maori communities pacific<br>communities in<br>new zealand and and so on but also if<br>you look at the one<br>the highlighted item at the bottom of<br>the slide<br>you know it was feasible<br>to provide telehealth and it was<br>feasible to deliver<br>education online but it was seen as well<br>not really as good<br>now not only is the impossible possible<br>but it's seen as the way of the future<br>and in fact to the point i mean this<br>university more or less overnight went<br>to delivering all of its coursework<br>online so that means we can have<br>students medical students and other<br>health professions students living<br>in learning in their own community and<br>just occasionally coming here<br>to the university into hamilton so that<br>you know the pandemic has done us a<br>favor it's opened up uh<br>opportunities and possibilities that<br>maybe just didn't seem to be there<br>before anyway it's time to wrap all of<br>this up<br>we've been on a bit of a journey<br>starting with what we all expect in<br>terms of health care<br>uh looking at the realities of of rural<br>health and medical education<br>rural medical education and the success<br>of northern ontario school of medicine<br>in producing graduates who have the<br>skills and the commitment<br>to serve people who who are most in need<br>of care but let's go back to the<br>original proposition which is<br>how rural medical education improves<br>health care for all<br>and i think you can see now that rural<br>medical education produces better<br>doctors<br>whether they become sub-specialist<br>neurosurgeons or<br>whatever specialty they choose they they<br>know and understand the rural context<br>and<br>the cultural dimensions they're focused<br>and understand the importance of the<br>health needs of the population<br>they're serving and they they appreciate<br>generalism<br>and at least some of them and probably a<br>lot more of them would actually<br>choose to be rural practitioners<br>so we came back to where we began with<br>the title there are some references for<br>those who want to follow this up and i<br>do want to highlight<br>this reference here so dr john burton is<br>here i believe john will you stand up<br>and take a bow<br>thank you john you can give him a round<br>so john is a gp in kaffir and in 2017 he<br>spent three months<br>traveling across northern ontario and so<br>this paper that he published in 2019<br>talks about his experience but connects<br>that experience to the new zealand<br>context okay that's it<br>the final slide is telling you about the<br>next<br>hamilton public lecture so i'll say<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
