One of the most challenging aspects is the development of methods to synthesise molecules for the first time.<br><br>In this talk Professor Barker will describe how taking up the challenge to prepare a wide variety of different molecules has led to range of opportunities in his career. From designing methods to make bioactive natural products, to synthesising potential treatments for triple-negative breast cancer, to forming a spin-out company to prepare biosensing devices and developing novel water treatment technologies, taking opportunities has led to a diverse range of research achievements throughout his career to date.<br><br>David Barker is a Professor of Organic and Medicinal Chemistry whose research focuses on the synthesis of organic molecules to answer chemical and biological questions. Whilst preparing these molecules he also explores fundamental chemical principles to aid the development of efficient synthetic methods. Davidâ€™s research group works on the synthesis of molecules for a number of purposes including novel bioactive molecules for the treatment of cancer and microbial infections, labelled compounds for agricultural analysis and novel polymer platforms for various applications, including biosensors. Recently, his work has also explored the modification of compounds from bio-renewable sources for removal of bacterial and small molecule pollutants from fresh water.<br><br>For more videos from the

organic<br>synthetic chemist and i guess i'm going<br>to talk about that journey<br>and i guess every journey has a<br>beginning okay so where did i begin<br>i was born in england okay my accent now<br>is kind of a bit of everywhere i've<br>lived in england australia<br>and now here for many years i grew up in<br>a little town called lee<br>in greater manchester 40 000 people if<br>you haven't heard of lee i'm not<br>surprised<br>it's famous for nothing okay it's<br>literally famous for nothing it's an old<br>coal mining town<br>i took my wife and my daughters there<br>once about six or seven years ago<br>they asked when they could leave okay it<br>was that appealing<br>i guess if i think about my early<br>childhood okay so i've got the<br>obligatory old photo there on the right<br>hand side that was my school photo in<br>the year before i left<br>to come to australia where i'll come to<br>see but in the center is i guess an<br>important<br>photo for what my upbringing was okay so<br>here<br>is my grandmother in the center of this<br>photo in the front row<br>and she'd just come over from australia<br>she'd moved there about 10 years ago<br>and the rest of the family had come to<br>see it and one thing you'll see here is<br>this little me being held by one of my<br>aunts<br>and they're all women okay my mother's<br>standing directly behind<br>and this really was representative of my<br>early childhood okay<br>lots of absent or distant men<br>okay my father at this time had left<br>he'd already divorced my mother and left<br>away<br>and i was brought up by my mother ever<br>since it's not a sob story it's just<br>reality<br>so women have always had an important<br>part in my life in my upbringing<br>and it has today no surprise that<br>perhaps when<br>children came upon me i had to suffer<br>these two who are sitting in the front<br>row<br>um i just sit in the front row and<br>listen and be embarrassed tonight you<br>might see some more photos of yourselves<br>girls later on<br>so after this kind of upbringing<br>while my mother was a single mother<br>bringing me up<br>no job living in effectively what we<br>call state house here<br>and she took up the opportunity at the<br>time which probably had the biggest<br>influence on my life<br>she decided to move to australia where<br>my grandmother was living and<br>effectively it was for free child care<br>okay and a bit of support you know we<br>moved to australia<br>and you say we moved to sydney and<br>people think of the harbour bridge<br>and the opera house they don't think of<br>blacktown okay<br>blacktown is a suburb 40 kilometres<br>inland<br>it's in the middle of suburbia there's<br>another 20 kilometers further out if you<br>like<br>and the camera knows what i'm talking<br>about and and we used to live there okay<br>and there's a population about 400 000<br>so 10 times as big<br>and it's still famous for nothing okay<br>so it's not much going on<br>in blacktown either and after a few<br>years of primary school i moved on to go<br>to high school where i did most of my<br>learning<br>and i went to dune side technology high<br>school okay<br>doing psych technology sounds terrible<br>it actually changed its name<br>halfway through i was there because the<br>rankings of the school were so bad<br>okay it was quite a violent school when<br>i got there there was fights weekly<br>and when i searched up my school this is<br>a news article i found from a year or so<br>ago<br>mob brawl police brought in it hasn't<br>got much better<br>okay so this is the kind of school that<br>i went to at the time<br>and there was 150 odd students who<br>started my year in year seven<br>at that school and what you got to think<br>about was by the time we got to the last<br>year<br>there was only 80 left okay most of<br>those have left to go to retail or go to<br>trades<br>of those 80 that were left 17 got to<br>actually<br>go to university i was one of those 17.<br>um<br>and that was a stellar year we were not<br>beaten the year before there was one<br>student who went to uni<br>the year after that was three and we<br>didn't get beaten to 17 for almost<br>another six or seven years<br>so it wasn't the particularly best<br>school to go to<br>when i was there i took my time i<br>enjoyed maths chemistry and woodwork if<br>i'd left early i probably would have<br>gone and become a builder<br>okay um i was inspired probably by mr<br>powell<br>chemistry teacher he used to do these<br>crazy lectures like<br>oxidizing sugar remember with sulfuric<br>acid<br>coughing us he'd overdone it and we're<br>breathing in this sugary smoke<br>but you know it was all these impactful<br>experiments that i really remember about<br>chemistry<br>i like maths as well i guess i did all<br>right i came ducks of the school<br>in 1992 and because of that i gained<br>entry to go<br>study science at the university of<br>sydney<br>and we think about chemistry okay as my<br>early beginnings<br>so in chemistry we did two years of it<br>and you do a general bit of everything<br>and then you learn two core subjects<br>in the hsc the high school certificate<br>in sydney um<br>and i did titrations and re and redox<br>okay they were the subjects the<br>topics that were chosen to be by my<br>teacher redox was pretty easy it's kind<br>of mass and equation juggling<br>and there was titrations and no matter<br>what i did<br>i could not get them right couldn't i<br>got totations right<br>i ended up coming third in the class<br>even though i was really well because i<br>failed the titration unit okay just<br>couldn't get that element right<br>and i do remember one other thing very<br>vividly is that we went to do a small<br>section in organic chemistry which is<br>the chemistry i'm going to talk about<br>you in the future<br>and my teacher's saying we're going in<br>the basic unit it's too hard it's<br>far too hard organic chemistry we're not<br>doing any more<br>so hard don't even think about it and we<br>learned something very basic we learned<br>how to<br>name alkanes and we learned one chemical<br>reaction the conversion of an acid to an<br>ester<br>and they make these lovely sweet<br>smelling compounds which i've been<br>telling my first years for many years<br>this is the kind of chemicals you eat in<br>your food that tastes<br>and smell nice okay so these are the<br>kind of chemicals<br>knowledge i came out of high school and<br>i went to university and i said i went<br>to study science at the university of<br>sydney<br>and i didn't do any fancy named subjects<br>they were chemistry<br>maths physics and biology okay and they<br>had ones at the end of each of those<br>subject names and that was basically it<br>i liked chemistry really did i went<br>there enjoying mass<br>after six months i hated maps the mass<br>lectures were<br>so boring really really boring and i<br>decided never again<br>and biology first time i actually really<br>enjoyed it actually i really enjoyed<br>that and in the second year i went on to<br>do a whole subject in organic chemistry<br>and what i discovered immediately is<br>that well to me it wasn't hard<br>okay this is kind of scary when i talk<br>to my students i've never studied once<br>for organic chemistry exam<br>it just makes sense okay it just makes<br>sense i don't have to study it just<br>kind of comes and biochemistry was<br>really good because it was basically<br>organic chemistry inside the body<br>and that was really easy for me i also<br>discovered in the second year lecture<br>why i was no good at titrations<br>because the lecturer put up this slide<br>okay and he said to me<br>and i remember talking turning to my<br>classmate and saying that's the number<br>four and it's not the number four<br>okay apparently it's the number 42. and<br>we were doing a lecture on pigments and<br>colors<br>and and the friend turned me she goes<br>it's 42.<br>and he said if you've just said four<br>you're colorblind and i went<br>well am i okay and i was 21 and didn't<br>know until that and that makes a lot of<br>sense why i wasn't getting any of those<br>titrations right at school<br>but what it meant was when i went to the<br>labs the week after and we were doing<br>titrations i told them<br>and they did them all for me and i got<br>100 and then<br>so that was that was very easy from<br>there on<br>i guess the first big opportunity i took<br>was when you think<br>i went to university no one in my family<br>had ever been to university before<br>i was the first person ever and i was<br>just studying<br>right i didn't really know what i wanted<br>to do or what i was going to do<br>afterwards i just kind of went to<br>degrees<br>so the university had a program where<br>you did a year in industry and you took<br>a year off<br>and you took a minimum paying job at a<br>scientific company and i went and worked<br>with this biotechnology company called<br>biotic australia they've gone bust now<br>and they made vaccines for for animals<br>and they also made diagnostic kits<br>sounds really interesting i spent every<br>day either working on the dna<br>synthesizer<br>or the dna sequencer day a day b<br>day a day b every day so why was that<br>interesting what was really interesting<br>is i got to see the people who had<br>degrees<br>who had master's degrees and had phds<br>and i decided i wanted the job with a<br>phd<br>because that was the job that i really<br>wanted to do so that also meant<br>i'm not going to get out of uni in three<br>years am i i've got to do a few more<br>years after that okay so i'd but at<br>least i'd mentally sign myself on<br>as a unknowledgeable student to what i<br>really wanted to do<br>later on in life now i say here<br>warning chicken wire what do i mean if<br>you're not a chemist here<br>okay you're going to see slots of<br>structures coming up that have hexagonal<br>shapes<br>which is the way we represent organic<br>molecules okay<br>and i'll try and lead you through it<br>slowly and nicely<br>but my biologist friend she goes ah you<br>deal with the chicken wire and i'll deal<br>with the wiggly bits<br>okay and that's the that's the way we<br>deal with it all right<br>so my research upbringing started in<br>1997 i did an honors project<br>and we tried to make and here you can<br>see the chicken wire at the top this<br>molecule called thiazino<br>i worked under the supervision of the<br>person that some of you might know in<br>this room<br>this was the then senior lecturer<br>margaret brimble who was at sydney<br>at that particular time and i learned<br>really three things about working this<br>molecule<br>i learned that i loved lab work okay i<br>would stay for any hours to do the lab<br>work<br>i really enjoyed the joy of learning new<br>experiments and just<br>playing with your hands and learning<br>things i also learned that the title at<br>the bottom<br>synthetic studies towards okay which<br>means that<br>you actually don't make the molecule you<br>want most of the time<br>and you're going to get a little way<br>there and that's going to be good enough<br>in most circumstances you're going to<br>learn some science on the way<br>okay so they're the three things i<br>really learned and at the end of that<br>time<br>my grandmother who you said many slides<br>ago was extremely proud i was the first<br>family member to graduate<br>from university and you know it was one<br>of a very proud day for us to graduate<br>with that degree<br>after that i liked it so much i wanted<br>to do more<br>so i stayed on to a phd and<br>i did this molecule we'll talk about it<br>in a second so<br>funny story when i went to start my phd<br>obviously i'd worked with margaret i<br>went to go see her<br>and she says to me oh your old project<br>was a bit rubbish i agree<br>let's do something new and she talked to<br>me about this molecule methyl like a<br>conatine it's a complicated molecule<br>and she said i've got some industry<br>funding from dupont chemicals and they<br>want some insecticides agrochemicals for<br>australia<br>uh we're working with the csiro and i<br>said yeah it sounds pretty cool and<br>we're talking for ages and she goes<br>i've got a couple things i need to say<br>i'm having a baby i'm having a baby it's<br>like okay<br>congratulations so i'm going to be away<br>for a while but i'm coming back and then<br>i'm going to be here four weeks and then<br>i'm going to auckland<br>and i'm going to leave do you still want<br>to the project and i'm like<br>i'm thinking my girlfriend would be<br>really disappointed if i went somewhere<br>else<br>so i decided to stay okay and that i<br>guess had the biggest influence<br>though mcleod came in after that as a<br>new lecturer and decided to<br>help me through the study the good bit<br>was an abstinence supervisor who was<br>away<br>and one who let me do what i want so for<br>three years<br>i did what i wanted right so basically<br>got to act as a supervisor<br>on my own project so what did i do if i<br>try and drive it down to a single bit<br>there's method like content i'm going to<br>try and use color to<br>aid you through what we do as a<br>scientist so the red pits of my methyl<br>lycopene were the bits that we had to<br>have<br>okay they were the bits that are<br>important for these compounds to be<br>insecticides the blue bits were nice to<br>have<br>and the black bits do we don't care and<br>i spent a long time making analogs or<br>bits of these molecules<br>so i made about 110 different ones of<br>those<br>and i said there was five of these<br>projects funded across australia and<br>when i<br>finished up the project we talked to the<br>other scientists and they said ah<br>there was 180 compounds made all across<br>australia and david made 110.<br>one other person made two and obviously<br>then at that point i realized<br>this was pretty successful project i'd<br>got nine papers out of it<br>you know it had been doing pretty well<br>and here's another graduation photo and<br>this time jackie gets to come along and<br>she's going no<br>photos of me and that's my mum there<br>again another proud day<br>for the family at that stage after that<br>jackie was working<br>so we wanted a postdoc and i decided to<br>stay in sydney while that was happening<br>and i went across the university of new<br>south wales i was able to get funding<br>from the<br>national health and medical research<br>council just like hrc here<br>and they gave me a postdoctoral<br>fellowship to work with larry wakelin<br>and again it was a project that was<br>directed by nature<br>so this natural product dystomicin you<br>can see it's kind of curved shape<br>we call them bananas okay they're banana<br>shaped molecules and on the<br>middle structure there you can see the<br>classical double helix of dna<br>and the red bit wrapping around it is<br>this banana<br>shaped molecule that we were interested<br>in now when it interacts with that dna<br>it interrupts its processes and it could<br>be useful for cancer<br>to stop those growth of those cells<br>so my job so larry was a pharmacologist<br>he wasn't a chemist<br>i was his only chemist i was actually in<br>a building completely separate like the<br>med school and the chemistry school here<br>totally divorced from them he said<br>making this molecule<br>there you go and he drawn it and i spent<br>two years working on this beautiful<br>banana<br>and it was a stinky wrong banana all<br>right<br>two years completely<br>unstable molecule unable to be made<br>nothing was joyful about that particular<br>process 30 chemical steps<br>to make that particular marker on the<br>last step it falls apart<br>so that's the joy but the benefit was<br>he said to me well you've got a year to<br>go just make me some bananas<br>okay anything you like i don't care run<br>out of ideas<br>so i got to design my own projects for a<br>year<br>and effectively pretend i was an<br>academic and design my own things<br>for a year and it was good training<br>right for taking on<br>the next leap so after doing this<br>we ended up in auckland how did we end<br>up in auckland because we to be honest<br>we weren't really imagining that we were<br>going to come to auckland we were going<br>to jack had just finished the job we<br>were off to go to do a postdoc<br>probably in europe and i'd written to a<br>professor at cambridge and he said yep<br>got a good record i'll take you on but i<br>know margaret brimble please send her an<br>email just to send me a letter<br>and i hadn't spoken to margaret for<br>about nearly three years<br>and i wrote her a letter and just by<br>chance a week before i sent that email i<br>was getting the<br>chemical literature and there was an ad<br>in there for a job for a lecturer<br>in auckland in medicinal chemistry and i<br>wrote and i was just doing some small<br>talk literally in the email at the last<br>line i said ah<br>i've been to auckland once to give that<br>talk who left to give that position open<br>i was just<br>trying to be chatty and she just wrote<br>back one line she goes if you're<br>well i did and here i am okay<br>as simple as that if i hadn't said that<br>small talk<br>i certainly probably wouldn't be<br>standing here and when i came here i<br>continued to do the work that i've been<br>done previously which would be to be<br>inspired by natural compounds<br>and make drugs from them and the first<br>molecule we're interested in is this one<br>called epiquinamide<br>and it's a compound that comes from a<br>rare endangered south american<br>poisoned frog and it was supposedly when<br>it was published going to be useful<br>as a treatment for alzheimer's disease<br>and you can see the little molecule<br>there below and i had enough training<br>and expertise to believe i could make<br>this<br>so i'm going to try and use epiquinomide<br>to describe<br>what my science is all about okay<br>effectively i'm an organic synthetic<br>chemist we make molecules out of organic<br>molecules<br>generally that means putting small<br>molecules together to make a bigger one<br>you could imagine that something like<br>lego<br>complicated lego but lego all right<br>imagine that we have an almost limitless<br>amount of pieces<br>that go together in the limitless line<br>of ways<br>but then most the time it doesn't work<br>and the pieces don't go together<br>so every time you design something half<br>the time or more<br>they don't go together as you plan and<br>you have to start again<br>and try again all right so that's the<br>problem with what we try and do<br>sounds easy but it's not<br>so what i came up with is two different<br>ways to make it equinami<br>and i've tried to color this to show you<br>what i did so the molecule in the center<br>has a blue ring and a red ring and has<br>some green<br>bits down the middle in my mind i<br>chopped it up<br>and there was either way you could have<br>the red ring and then stick on the blue<br>or you could have the blue ring and<br>stick on the red<br>okay they're the two approaches that i<br>thought well in my first year here<br>all primed new lecturer we tried the<br>first route<br>let's just say it didn't work okay we<br>tried a whole bunch of things and for a<br>whole year that's how long it takes<br>we didn't get any results<br>but in the second year we had some<br>success and this is how we represent our<br>science i'm going to show it to you once<br>all right so effectively what it is is<br>we started with the blue ring molecule<br>you can see the laser pointer<br>we do a couple of chemical reactions you<br>don't have to know the details to<br>convert this<br>black group into another and then we<br>start to add in<br>the red atoms so we've got the blue and<br>the green we start to add the red<br>but it's not the form we want so we do a<br>couple more chemical reactions to change<br>it<br>another one to close the ring and then<br>after that<br>we're still not quite there and we do<br>four more chemical reactions on top of<br>that<br>and eventually we get to our compounds<br>right now people who don't know organic<br>chemistry go oh that's 14 steps whoops<br>it's 14 steps and when you do a<br>laboratory in the undergraduate library<br>or at school that takes a couple of<br>hours each<br>so when i tell them we've got 14 steps<br>to do they go they'll be ready in about<br>a couple of months and you go ah no it<br>won't<br>no it will not so that took a whole year<br>because for every result i showed you<br>there i went back and had a look<br>and there was two steps back for<br>everyone forward okay<br>that's the way it works until you<br>eventually get to where you want to<br>so it took a year to do that we were<br>beaten to be the first people to do it<br>by two months<br>which is also a problem with our work if<br>there's an interesting molecule someone<br>else wants to get it too<br>so they're doing it somewhere else in<br>the world in this case it was in europe<br>at the same time we're doing it here and<br>you try your best to be first<br>what was even more interesting was that<br>everyone who made it so our group the<br>europe group<br>and others all discovered that it was<br>completely useless<br>and actually the original scientist<br>there was a tiny little sliver of some<br>impurity that had the activity<br>and we'd all be making the wrong thing<br>i've got a lot of citations that are<br>making a molecule that didn't get<br>any but it was interesting as a new<br>academic to work on this work<br>and we've been inspired by nature ever<br>since okay<br>we've gone on from those early days to<br>make all these molecules so the names<br>underneath<br>on each one of these are the students<br>who've worked on each of these projects<br>and we've made all these natural<br>products over the years<br>all generally because their bio activity<br>or their unusual structure<br>why do we do it okay when nature<br>produces some wonderful active molecules<br>for bioactivity<br>so we try and create them also nature<br>has some wonderful ways of putting<br>molecules together<br>so we have to develop new ways to put<br>our lego together in order to make them<br>and that's<br>half the science and also the chemists<br>who do this they learn a<br>broad range of skills which they can go<br>on to use on whatever molecule they<br>might work<br>now a lot of these molecules here i<br>should say were done in collaboration<br>with brent kopp because they were from a<br>marine origin at the beginning<br>so we worked on a number of these<br>molecules over the years<br>one class of natural product that i've<br>spent more time on than most<br>is lignans and they don't come from uh<br>from plant<br>from from the marine they come from<br>plants and in fact if you've had sesame<br>seeds you've eaten them they're found in<br>many common foods<br>and they are basically dimers of these<br>compounds i've tried to show you they've<br>got a blue bit and a red bit and they<br>get stuck together in<br>multiple ways with lots of different<br>variations and there's thousands upon<br>thousands of variants of these<br>and many of them are very active from a<br>bacteria or virus<br>against liver disease okay so we've been<br>interested in making it these<br>and we've spent many years and again you<br>can see some of the students some of<br>them have come back to see me tonight<br>to work on some of these chemicals but<br>how did i get into this particular area<br>it all came by chance okay so i went up<br>to a talk at the<br>auckland cancer research center up the<br>road and they had a symposium day<br>and i remember hearing some scientists<br>talk about hypoxia which is a process<br>that happens<br>in cancer and i learned a little bit<br>about that lecture<br>i learned a little bit about epoxy and i<br>came back to my office and a couple of<br>days later i was reading a journal<br>and i saw this title and it said this<br>compound mana sentence b<br>was useful against hypoxia and literally<br>it was the title of the paper that drew<br>me in<br>and i looked at the structure and went<br>ma i haven't worked on anything like<br>this maybe i'd be interested in doing so<br>and i applied for some funding it took<br>two years to get through the marsden<br>fund actually in the third year<br>we eventually got some funding to make<br>this particular molecule<br>i got an interesting story about this so<br>when i first came to talk about the<br>results on this<br>i went to a big conference on organic<br>chemistry in the uk<br>and i went back there and actually saw<br>my father for the first time in two<br>decades<br>and we and he lives in a little town<br>called rishton okay a little town in<br>wriston in blackburn<br>7 000 people and i was walking off my<br>jet lag walking down the street<br>and i saw one of these blue signs stuck<br>to the side of the building anyone who's<br>been to the uk<br>will know these little heritage signs<br>they tell you that lord so-and-so was<br>there<br>or something important happened here so<br>i wandered over just to see what it was<br>and this is the sign that's in this<br>building so look<br>sir marsden okay who is the name of the<br>fund that gave me the money to do this<br>was born in this house in this tiny<br>village<br>all those years ago okay and i thought<br>that was actually i still think it's<br>quite spooky<br>all right of all the places to go that<br>uh that happened<br>and i went and gave that conference<br>presentation and it won an award for one<br>of the best talks<br>i got a number of invited uh journal<br>articles prepared from that<br>and i guess i felt good about myself all<br>right that it was kind of meant to be<br>that to do this kind of work and we've<br>gone on for many years and we've<br>made over 60 natural ligaments over many<br>many classes<br>lots of different complexity in these<br>structures and we enjoy making these<br>kind of molecules all right so something<br>that we continue to do and there's a<br>number of<br>new students coming to work on this<br>right now<br>we've also worked on other projects and<br>i see the man standing at the back here<br>i've been working on wine derived<br>natural products and that's because a<br>crazy italian walked in my door<br>nine years ago and bruno is hiding now<br>and decided yeah there he is he's waving<br>at the back<br>and decided would you work with me on<br>some wine compounds<br>now bruno is italian where have i been<br>thinking about italian things lately<br>oh yeah that's the italians losing the<br>america's car<br>sorry bruno you can't win them all<br>so we've been working on compounds like<br>this all right and we hear you see<br>the difference between these molecules<br>and the others they all come from wine<br>but they all have deuterium on them<br>which is labeling and i'm sure one day<br>bruno will come and tell you all why the<br>deuterium is important<br>on these particular molecules<br>synthetically what it means<br>instead of playing my big block of<br>bricks i get to work with a smaller<br>block<br>right because adding those deuteriums is<br>difficult but we still get the challenge<br>of making all these kind of molecules<br>and we've done so for many years<br>i've now been able to combine the love<br>of these two items so<br>we've got lignans and we've got wine<br>because it's interesting that these<br>compounds line erythema here and the<br>students working on this<br>right at this moment these compounds are<br>believed to leach from the wine barrels<br>the wood from the wine barrels and they<br>cause bitterness in the wine and we've<br>made for the first time now the first<br>deuterium<br>labeled standards of these particular<br>compounds and we're going to be studying<br>how the effect of bitterness that will<br>come out of these wines using these<br>another branch of chemistry that i do<br>love is medicinal chemistry i said i've<br>been inspired by nature<br>to make a lot of medicinal compounds and<br>i still am sometimes we don't just make<br>the natural compound<br>we make modifications of that one we can<br>do better than nature<br>and here's just three examples we can<br>see where we took a natural compound<br>and we made something that looked a bit<br>like it and they all ended up having<br>better bioactivity than the natural<br>compound itself<br>but another type of medicinal chemistry<br>we did i guess started from an<br>unusual opportunity in 2009 and that's<br>from a former colleague of ours johannes<br>reinerson<br>and he came to see me<br>about a particular project he was<br>working on and he was doing some<br>computational chemistry on this<br>particular enzyme called a phospholipase<br>and he said to me david i've<br>computationally done all this<br>theoretical chemistry and i think<br>this small little molecule you see on<br>the left here<br>will bind into this enzyme and it will<br>stop cancers<br>because the problem is i've talked to<br>all these chemists and no one's<br>interested in working with me<br>and i'm like who sells a project this<br>way right<br>you know who comes and says no one else<br>wants to work with you but will you do<br>it<br>and those of you who know johannes will<br>understand that's just the way he was<br>right he's very open and honest about<br>the things he did<br>um but i looked at it and i went well<br>this is different this is different to<br>what i'm doing i'm going to take the<br>opportunity here<br>to take on something new and what we try<br>to do in this kind of chemistry is we<br>use what we call a locking key mechanism<br>so we have an enzyme it looks like<br>something on the left it's got an open<br>pocket<br>and generally the drugs that we try to<br>do have lots of interactions like the<br>one in the middle and we try and fill<br>that space<br>that's a very simplistic view and what<br>johannes had given me was something like<br>on the right<br>a compound that kind of fits a little<br>bit but<br>needs a lot more work to do to be done<br>to it to make it really good<br>and that's my starting point and i<br>looked at the molecule and i went<br>there's lots of places you can change<br>okay lots of places you can change on<br>this molecule<br>there's the left bit the right bit the<br>nitrogens the sulfurs what should i<br>change<br>first in fact as a chemist i didn't even<br>know where to start okay we've been<br>doing this project<br>continually since 2009 because there's<br>so much variation that we can do<br>but the first thing i want to do is<br>design a synthesis that would let me<br>change all these things very simply<br>okay without having to redesign<br>something every single time<br>and that's the skills i think i can have<br>so here's an example molecule of<br>something we'd like to build<br>and again i'm going to try and use<br>colors to show you how my mind<br>does this kind of work so i split this<br>molecule up into three bits<br>the green the red and the blue i<br>remember those colors even though i<br>can't really see them that well<br>and there you can see the colors and<br>what my mind does is go snip<br>snip and it breaks it into pieces and i<br>do this at home<br>and i draw things on the you know<br>jackie's shaking ahead here<br>i do this on the shower you know in the<br>dark you know and i'm always drawing<br>these kind of things and she's always<br>asking me do you need this piece of<br>paper<br>you know these sorts of things i do it<br>all the time and i chose these three<br>bits because multiple of them could be<br>changed into other things so we could<br>have lots of diversity<br>with one simple synthesis that could be<br>recreated many times<br>and which means when you come to my<br>office you often see models okay and<br>we're doing the same thing except in my<br>mind i'm doing it with these are the<br>fancy chemist lego<br>okay we get to build these molecules<br>that represent what we're doing<br>sometimes i do it at home because i<br>don't have models i use pegs<br>right and i can make some molecules out<br>of pegs and sometimes i take my model<br>kit home<br>and magnolia my daughter makes better<br>molecules than i've ever made<br>this is stick man she tells me to make<br>it maybe one day i will<br>all right it's pretty cool it's got a<br>few too many bonds but we might get<br>there one day<br>and we started this project by changing<br>the left and the right hand side<br>and we discovered the bigger the left<br>the left-hand side the blue portion<br>the better the molecules that's an<br>easier discovery on the right hand side<br>we had three particular positions on<br>that ring we could change the x the y<br>and the z<br>we discovered if we stuck things at x<br>and y the compounds kill cancer<br>beautifully<br>right and we always have those groups<br>for killing cancer if we had something<br>at the z position the far away one<br>they didn't kill cancer at all they were<br>completely inactive<br>and so we don't make many of those<br>because we're trying to kill cancer all<br>right<br>but interestingly i'm going to bring<br>that up in a couple of slides because<br>this<br>forms the basis of something new so we<br>made a whole bunch of compounds here<br>and then we moved on and we tested these<br>and we discovered that yes the tumors<br>of the mice that we treated with these<br>got smaller<br>so they were effective the cells formed<br>these unique little ball-like shapes<br>they didn't migrate around the body<br>while around the mouse body and they<br>didn't form secondary tumors and we've<br>been funded many times to continue this<br>particular work<br>and we knew we were hitting the target<br>that we were trying to hit which is<br>these phospholipase<br>so then we decided what else can we<br>change plenty more spots here<br>so there was the pink the green<br>and the blue sections okay well let's<br>talk about the pink and the green<br>and the orange there is just for those<br>people who are interested<br>well we couldn't do anything to the pink<br>the nitrogens had to stay exactly as<br>they were you change them at all<br>wasting your time the central bed which<br>was sulfur<br>well we discovered you could use<br>anything in group 16 on the periodic<br>table so we made oxygen sulfur selenium<br>tellurium<br>some of the first times they've ever<br>been made anywhere<br>and those kind of molecules the next one<br>down there is polonium<br>polonium is radioactive i promise you<br>doug we won't be working on those around<br>the school<br>all right so there'll be no radioactive<br>research<br>on those particular compounds<br>that left one area the blue area okay<br>what could we do over here well we've<br>done lots<br>okay we've made over 250 compounds of<br>variations here<br>i just show you a small subset and what<br>we discovered is the bigger the group<br>the more lipophilic it is the more fatty<br>it is they get better and better<br>the sum i can't show you for specific<br>reasons they're perhaps too good that i<br>want to let you know<br>okay and we've got down to very very<br>potent sub-nanomolar<br>activity levels on these particular<br>compounds and we continue to work on<br>these compounds even today<br>this is the interesting thing so i come<br>back to this diagram here where we said<br>x and y was great for cancer and y was<br>not<br>we ran all our compounds versus another<br>phospholipase a phospholipase d<br>a specific enzyme called uh tdp-1<br>and that's important because it actually<br>repairs the damage that chemotherapy<br>does<br>so if you're getting standard<br>chemotherapy your cells work against it<br>and try and defeat it<br>well our compounds with the z group<br>defeat tdp one<br>okay and we've just been recently funded<br>by the cancer society to do<br>a whole study on whether we can make<br>those because we haven't made many of<br>them<br>because they didn't do what we<br>previously wanted and now we're going to<br>be studying that over the next couple of<br>years<br>i also do a number of other cancer<br>projects we make<br>hypoxia again we go back to hypoxia<br>hypoxia intercalators with these unusual<br>molecules that<br>interact with the dna and stop the<br>action and we work on other<br>phospholipases that are important in<br>breast cancer<br>and we try and inhibit those particular<br>processes as well<br>another type of research that i started<br>in exactly the same years 2009<br>again also kind of happened by chance so<br>a phd student of udrankas walked into my<br>office anna palmer and she said to me<br>david i've got jujenko as my supervisor<br>but i want to make something<br>i need some help making here's a paper<br>they want to look a bit like this<br>can you help me and i remember it's like<br>four o'clock in the afternoon on a<br>friday<br>and i'm like do i want to do any more<br>and i took the paper home and i remember<br>thinking about it over the weekend<br>do i just do i want to do something new<br>i thought well you know what<br>let's take an opportunity to see where<br>this goes right let's see if it could be<br>something useful<br>and go somewhere well it did all right<br>it went a long way<br>i remember the first paper we ever<br>published<br>i had a figure look like this there's no<br>chicken wire there all right<br>this is how you drank it draws a lot of<br>her pictures that little squiggle on<br>that ball<br>took anna palmer two years to make<br>because the reality is it is more<br>chicken wire<br>okay so it was a fluorescent polymer<br>that had dna attached to it it was a dna<br>sensor<br>and had solubilizing grooves and we<br>designed all these bits and put them<br>together<br>you know so that was the part that i did<br>in the big picture of the squiggles and<br>the balls<br>and we still do stuff like that and i<br>kind of was<br>reading this polymer literature and i<br>realized there's lots of different<br>monomers that get used all the time<br>and sometimes the synthesis of the bits<br>is really complicated trying to put the<br>bits that you want all over it seem to<br>be a bit of a chore<br>so what i tried to do was simplify the<br>idea<br>that if we could have a very similar<br>backbone that was easy to make<br>with similar pieces that had the similar<br>science<br>and then just the x's and the y's the<br>variable bits that hang off were<br>different<br>then maybe we could make more molecules<br>more quickly and we could do more<br>science<br>all right so i designed a synthesis that<br>started from something really simple<br>hydroquinone very cheap<br>and we do a set of chemical reactions<br>and the first one of these is the most<br>important so that first<br>arrow you can see i add on these r1<br>groups and in chemistry r1 just means a<br>variable<br>all right we've added one variation and<br>we do a couple of other simple chemistry<br>and we end up with<br>one of my lego building blocks from the<br>same starting material i can just put on<br>another another r group<br>right so it's a different variable and<br>do the same chemical reaction for the<br>next step and i combine those two<br>together<br>and you end up with a polymer okay so<br>not much variation in the steps<br>anybody should be able to do it to make<br>you these chemicals<br>but r1 and r2 can be a massive variation<br>of things and you can end up with a lot<br>of diversity<br>so there's an example of what the r1s<br>were from the previous slide<br>why do we do it well these polymers are<br>highly fluorescent<br>they're colored but under uv light they<br>fluoresce very highly<br>when you have molecules that interact<br>with these polymers they change their<br>color slight<br>quite subtly you can measure it and you<br>can see the interactions that occur<br>around them<br>and then you can measure things okay you<br>can measure those interactions<br>and then we took the step even further<br>so we took the same polymer<br>but instead of keeping them with simple<br>r1s we decided<br>we'd grow okay so we grow one polymer<br>off another one and we'd have multiple<br>units<br>of it this is called grafting and we end<br>up with polymers that look like this one<br>so here we have cationic antibacterial<br>brushes<br>that sit on that fluorescent polymer and<br>you see the picture on the right hand<br>side here's bacteria<br>in the presence of our polymer they're<br>all glowing nicely because it's<br>fluorescent<br>the groups around it make it kill the<br>bacteria<br>and what's interesting is the bacteria<br>die the color changes so we can sense<br>that they are dying<br>okay so it's nice and easy to do we did<br>another project where we got rid of the<br>killing groups and we put sticky groups<br>so here we can have a highly fluorescent<br>molecule like at the top<br>and this is very sticky and we thought<br>about oh we've got another marsden fund<br>together with this particular project we<br>were doing sticky<br>bio-compatible polymers that could be<br>useful for electronic devices<br>and from here we went on to look at<br>another class of poland that's very<br>similar which are conducting polymers<br>and conducting polymers<br>effectively molecular wires no metals<br>and from those they're used in lots of<br>applications from drug delivery to oled<br>screens heaps and heaps of uses so wide<br>applications<br>and a lot of the chemicals you can see<br>look like the ones at the bottom here<br>very simple looking structures if you<br>want to modify them<br>it's quite hard so again i use my<br>chemical brain to say how could we make<br>modifying these easier well to me it was<br>simple<br>we take out one of the rings and we<br>stick in something else and if we use<br>the same group that we did in the last<br>synthesis<br>be dead easy to make so we took the same<br>or groups<br>from the last synthesis we stuck on<br>another group and we had our what we<br>called our little lego blocks<br>okay and we had our groups of compounds<br>that we can mix and match<br>easily made on multi-grain scale and<br>these had lots of chemical diversity<br>and the good bit of these you can<br>combine them you want a smidge of this<br>a toss of that and you put them all<br>together and you end up with a different<br>particular<br>compound and eddie's laughing because he<br>did all the work<br>all right so you may have these<br>conducting polymers which have<br>solubilizing groups so you can make them<br>soluble in water in alcohols in<br>organic solvents you can have two types<br>of multiple types of functionality<br>to change the properties of the molecule<br>later it's almost infinite what you can<br>do<br>with these particular compounds we use<br>them for lots of publications lots of<br>different areas i'm just going to show<br>you two simple examples tonight<br>so the first one of those we stuck on a<br>cell adhesion peptide<br>and there you can see this little<br>peptide what happens is once in the<br>presence of these cells like to sit on<br>these particular molecules<br>and the picture on the right is as<br>showing strands of these particular<br>polymers<br>and sitting on top the dark smears are<br>skin cells<br>okay so there's skin cells living on top<br>of that associated with this particular<br>polymer<br>and very happy in their environment<br>a second approach that we did is<br>something that doug mentioned before we<br>went back to our original idea of doing<br>dna sensing<br>so we took one of the compounds this one<br>had an acid on it and we attached a<br>piece of dna<br>okay and dna lights to interact and so<br>we made a polymer of that<br>and what we discovered well it's well<br>known is that that<br>single strand piece of dna will interact<br>with another<br>and in that interaction the electronic<br>properties of the polymer will change<br>okay and it'll change and you'll be able<br>to read that response<br>and that means you'll be able to detect<br>certain pieces of dna for instance that<br>might be a bacteria<br>or a virus or it might be for instance a<br>disease marker<br>and we we did win a prize the velocity<br>challenge of that<br>the first prize in that particular we<br>started a company called spot check<br>and we've been doing some dna sensing<br>ever since commercialization is<br>challenging okay very challenging<br>because not only does the science need<br>to work<br>all the other basis needs to but we<br>still continue to work on the science<br>of this particular problem but what this<br>really did these many years<br>got me thinking about materials in a<br>different way<br>it used to work only on small molecules<br>now the big ones weren't so challenging<br>either<br>and again we went back to bruno and we<br>were talking about a project where maybe<br>we could take some molecules<br>out of wine waste and wine waste itself<br>has been used<br>as a matrix for making materials we want<br>to extract specific chemicals out of<br>them and make them into<br>pure polymers so we took quercetin out<br>of wine waste<br>and we polymerized it to make these<br>materials and then we made<br>electrospine into these fine fibers and<br>again we won a velocity price challenge<br>on this particular result where we were<br>able to get<br>in this case uh potential wound dressing<br>okay because there's antibacterial<br>materials<br>but it's all natural because everything<br>comes from the natural source<br>and this work kind of dealing with<br>natural compounds got me thinking even<br>further<br>so another thing that i did for many<br>years a few years ago was i was the<br>chairperson<br>of the board of trustees of my<br>daughter's primary school<br>because what the hell why not just throw<br>him more into the mix of doing a job<br>and the reason i went and did that is<br>because we were really trying to push<br>stem teaching<br>at the local primary schools and we had<br>a bit of a hub that we taught other<br>primary school teachers around us and i<br>remember there was one<br>day where we did i had a maori cultural<br>day and we had some people coming in and<br>they were telling us all about<br>things like flax you know and we were<br>doing tayanga which is sacred materials<br>and he was talking about harukiki flax<br>and how it's used for<br>bags and dresses and all sorts of<br>natural materials<br>and i remember he made a very specific<br>thing because he says ah also when it's<br>found on riverbeds it filters the water<br>okay what he was talking about was the<br>roots of the plant absorbing pollutants<br>as it flows through<br>but i got in my head that perhaps the<br>leaves above it could be used for a<br>filter as well<br>okay so along with one of my phd<br>students what we decided to do was<br>combine<br>multiple natural materials together to<br>make a filter substance<br>so we took harukiki flags and we ended<br>up getting flex fibers from it<br>that they usually do the weaving we took<br>another natural material which is<br>kaitosan<br>which comes from shellfish waste and we<br>took this material<br>and we chemically modified these<br>together and together with brent and vg<br>we've been studying these materials over<br>a number of years<br>and do they work well we're happy to say<br>that they kind of do work<br>right so here you can see there's the<br>flask on the right so we have<br>bacteria brass growing quite happily on<br>the left-hand side of the one that says<br>flax<br>okay we have the sample we put in our<br>antibacterial flax material in there<br>and obviously the growth and if you look<br>from above it's far more evident<br>right so you've got the dirty water with<br>the bacteria and when the water passes<br>through our harukiki filter<br>we have the death of those particular<br>bacteria in this<br>material and using this<br>got me into something that i was kind of<br>going forward with today so we talked<br>about this<br>i was asked by uni services with another<br>another number<br>of other academics from the school to go<br>talk in china that was an interesting<br>trip and we talked to the uni services<br>there about our natural materials and<br>green advances<br>i came back i ended up going to national<br>science challenges workshop<br>and i was eventually invited on to a<br>brand new multi-million dollar<br>multi-year project<br>on clean water and this is a very<br>similar approach<br>except it's probably just a bit more<br>high-tech than using flax fibre<br>really what we're going to do is use all<br>natural materials<br>and you can see them i'm going to three<br>3d print them i'm going to end up with<br>these like kind of architectures you see<br>here in the middle<br>these wonderful 3d architectures all<br>made from natural materials and we're<br>going to use these all the way up to a<br>pilot scale<br>to filter waters of a couple of small<br>townships and very large farms across<br>new zealand<br>and it's working mainly i'm the only<br>chemist there's a lot of engineers<br>life cycle analysis people so what am i<br>going to be doing in all this<br>well i won't be measuring the water<br>pollution i won't even be making the<br>pilot planting<br>probably why i'm doing any 3d printing<br>though maybe i'm going to try my hand at<br>a bit of that<br>so i won't need to work with that stuff<br>but i will be in the lab<br>helping making building blocks to enable<br>everything that goes on from down<br>there and that's something we're hoping<br>to we'll be starting next month and<br>doing<br>for the next few years or after that so<br>really all i've got to do now is just<br>thank some people<br>we don't do this okay on my own i come<br>up with some ideas i help some people do<br>it and i really enjoy<br>helping those people so as i said<br>there's been over 80 students who've<br>worked in my laboratory<br>there's probably people i've missed and<br>if you're here i'm sorry but there are<br>some of the people that worked on on<br>these i've worked for the number of<br>different staff in the school these are<br>all the people i publish with<br>i think there's nearly 20 staff in the<br>school because i like to do<br>multi-disciplinary<br>research and work with lots of people a<br>lot of cool different stuff<br>if you take the opportunity to work with<br>other people you will<br>do interesting things and i'd like to<br>thank obviously the funders who fund all<br>the money you know we have<br>science is expensive people are<br>expensive and you have to get the money<br>in order to do that<br>and last of all i'd like to thank my<br>family who've come along tonight<br>they put up with me and this weird job<br>and all the hours that you do on it<br>um thank you so much for supporting me<br>in everything that i do<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
