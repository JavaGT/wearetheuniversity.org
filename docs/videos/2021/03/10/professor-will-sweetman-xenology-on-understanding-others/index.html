Once the Portuguese opened the sea route to India at the end of the 15th century, European knowledge of Indian society and culture was advanced by a stream of letters and books written by travelers, missionaries, merchants, soldiers and colonial officials.<br><br>Will’s work examines both the sources of their knowledge of India and the use their works were put to in debates among scholars in Europe in the period leading up to the Enlightenment. He has a particular interest in Indian religion, and how Europeans put what they knew of Hinduism and Buddhism to use in polemics between Catholics, Protestants, deists, atheists and freethinkers in Europe.<br><br>His recent work has examined European collections of Indian manuscripts—especially the Vedas, India’s oldest sacred text. He is currently writing a book on the devadasis, the Indian temple dancers who have fascinated Europeans since Marco Polo visited India on his way back from China.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

inaugural<br>professor's career<br>i'd also like to acknowledge the<br>presence of staff and students from<br>around the university<br>including our pro vice chancellor of<br>sciences who has taken time out of his<br>busy schedule to come here today<br>and also our chancellor dr royden<br>somerville<br>to each and every one of you who are<br>here this evening no my haramai welcome<br>now professor will sweetman has an<br>international reputation<br>as a first class researcher he's<br>distinguished himself by his meticulous<br>incisive and groundbreaking<br>investigations of european writings<br>about religion in south india during the<br>16th<br>to the 19th centuries his impressive<br>language skills<br>and his immersion in archival materials<br>have allowed him to make important<br>contributions to the academic study of<br>religion<br>as you will learn this evening professor<br>sweetman is a passionate teacher<br>and a popular postgraduate supervisor<br>he excels not only in traditional<br>classroom teaching<br>but also he's an outstanding distance<br>teacher where he's developed a suite of<br>extremely distinctive<br>digital courses throughout his career<br>professor sweetman's service to his<br>discipline to his department<br>and to this university have been<br>numerous substantial and valuable<br>last but certainly not least will is an<br>extremely collegial<br>and entrepreneurial member of our<br>academic community<br>and we are extremely lucky to call him<br>one of our own<br>so will on behalf of the university of<br>otago it gives me great pleasure to<br>congratulate you personally on your very<br>very well-deserved promotion to<br>professor<br>i am very much looking forward to your<br>lecture<br>i will now call on dr john shaver to<br>tell us just a little bit more about<br>will's academic<br>journey to professor norera tena koto<br>it is my great honor to introduce<br>professor will sweetman this evening<br>will comes with an impressive research<br>record and i believe i am supposed to<br>focus my time<br>on this record but given that the title<br>of will's lecture is enology<br>or the understanding of something<br>foreign in describing will's academic<br>journey i also hope to shed light on the<br>foreign and unique entity<br>will began a recent journal article with<br>perhaps the truest sentence he's ever<br>written<br>and i quote no child dreams of becoming<br>what an understatement but there's<br>something common to the work<br>and background of the scholars of<br>religion i admire<br>they are inquisitive analytically gifted<br>and have grown up inside of religion but<br>critical of it<br>and wilt definitely fits this profile<br>will was born in rhodesia a child of<br>colonialism<br>his mother was born in what is now<br>botswana<br>her father arrived in south africa after<br>deserting from the british army in india<br>in about 1919.<br>will's father from england went to<br>rhodesia in 1951 because he couldn't<br>afford a house in london<br>his father worked as an accountant and<br>was a methodist lay preacher while he<br>was still working<br>after retirement he became an ordained<br>minister<br>one his family moved to england when he<br>was 13 and he eventually attended the<br>university of lancaster<br>where he initially sought to study<br>philosophy and maths<br>prior to his first year he was looking<br>for a third subject and wanted to study<br>psychology<br>but the line for enrollment was long and<br>so he ended up signing up for the much<br>from this inauspicious beginning owing<br>to laziness will embarked on what would<br>become his scholarly passion<br>after his first year he lost his his<br>desire to study maths and<br>any lingering faith in christianity due<br>in part to his exposure to first-year<br>philosophy<br>but also lancaster's critical rather<br>than apologetic approach to the study of<br>religions<br>will graduated lancaster with honors and<br>then went on to cambridge<br>as anyone who knows wilkin can attest he<br>likes to begin just about every other<br>sentence with the phrase<br>when i used to row at cambridge<br>and that's usually followed by some<br>non-sequitur of some kind<br>but it but it turns out he did some<br>other things than more than rowan<br>rowing while he was there at cambridge<br>will begin work on the colonial<br>construction of hinduism<br>through the careful study of missionary<br>interpretations of hinduism<br>today his published work on this topic<br>appears in three books two edited<br>volumes and numerous journal articles<br>and book chapters<br>well's work has been important for at<br>least three reasons<br>first will has made major contributions<br>to the critical histo<br>historiography of the term religion in<br>its strategic usage in the context of<br>european imperialism<br>and colonialization and construction of<br>knowledge about other religions<br>secondly his research has pointed to the<br>significance of the differences between<br>protestant and catholic appreciations of<br>indian religions<br>will's research includes studies and<br>translations of french<br>german dutch and portuguese sources<br>these works are now standard references<br>in all histories of hinduism by indian<br>and other scholars<br>thirdly will has worked out the<br>implications of the revised<br>historiography<br>including his own noteworthy role in<br>this for our understanding of hindu<br>and to some extent indian buddhist<br>religious traditions<br>in terms of his professional career in<br>1998 will became a lecture in religious<br>studies at middlesex<br>university in london and then moved to<br>newcastle where he was a lecturer from<br>2000 to 2004.<br>he came to otago in 2004 and joined the<br>department of theology and religion<br>where he served as head<br>for five years until the programs were<br>split in 2019<br>and the religion program was moved to<br>the school of social sciences<br>in this move to the school of social<br>sciences of which he is now head<br>the religion program was able to stand<br>as an independent program<br>thanks to will's leadership just after<br>he was hired at otago about a year later<br>he was the only full-time member of<br>religious studies<br>but since that time will has fostered<br>tremendous growth<br>and we net we will soon have six<br>full-time staff members<br>indeed i would not be standing here<br>today if it were not for will<br>the health of the religion program since<br>will's arrival is a direct result of his<br>acumen<br>as a leader in summary professor<br>sweetman's research has made major<br>contributions to the academic study of<br>religions<br>both the hindu studies and to the<br>discipline itself<br>he's acknowledged as a renowned scholar<br>of early european studies of religion<br>and is a strong institutional<br>contributor he also used to row at<br>cambridge<br>with that allow me to introduce<br>professor will sweetman<br>um i thought that might happen because<br>i've been to one of these before<br>so i thought i'd make myself feel better<br>and make you all feel better by<br>quoting a little bit of the uh the faint<br>praise<br>with which my work has been damned um by<br>people who i regard as friends<br>and the one of which i am perhaps most<br>proud<br>and here you can see my robustness<br>okay let's let's i'll start a little<br>more forward<br>chancellor vice chancellor tanakwe pro<br>vice chancellor<br>and i have to begin uh by thanking my<br>family<br>of course<br>i think a lot of academics say that they<br>they probably<br>couldn't do what they do without their<br>wife<br>it's true also in my case uh in my case<br>it's true because i can't work when i'm<br>miserable<br>when i'm unhappy<br>alex<br>we're pioneers long before coronavirus<br>arty is really the only member of the<br>family who really listens when<br>dad starts banging on about india<br>and history and the mahabharata and the<br>like<br>the telly produced this beautiful poster<br>which i much prefer<br>so the official version uh for my<br>lecture<br>uh william james when he was describing<br>the healthy-minded temperament<br>said that there are people who seem to<br>have started life<br>with a bar a bottle or two of champagne<br>and my colleagues<br>greg and elizabeth i won't say my oldest<br>colleagues my colleagues are longer<br>standing<br>um thank you greatly for all the work<br>that you have done in your different in<br>your different ways<br>and john my mariners<br>souls that have toiled and wrought<br>and fought with me that ever with a<br>frolic welcome<br>took the thunder and the sunshine and<br>opposed free heads<br>and of my newer colleagues joseph and<br>law and lena who's about to<br>about to join us thank you all and my<br>wider colleagues in the school<br>and in the division and the university<br>i'm very grateful it's been a wonderful<br>all right<br>i knew a real theologian once he had<br>mastered the languages of the orient<br>and the rights of the ancient nations<br>the brahmanas<br>the chaldeans the fire worshipers<br>the serbians the syrians and the<br>egyptians all were as well known to him<br>as the jews he was familiar with the<br>various readings of the bible<br>for 30 years he had tried to reconcile<br>the gospels and to make the fathers of<br>the church<br>agree with one another he sought to date<br>precisely the apostles creed and that<br>which is<br>we know under the name of athanasius<br>to show how the sacraments were<br>instituted one after<br>the other show the difference between<br>the difficulty of organizing in his head<br>so many obscure matters<br>um and throwing light on on on such<br>cloudy<br>uh uh things which are by their very<br>nature so cloudy<br>often gave him pause but as such things<br>were the duty of his profession<br>he gave himself up to them despite his<br>distaste<br>at length he arrived at knowledge much<br>greater than those of his brethren<br>but the more he learned the more<br>skeptical he became of all he knew<br>as long as he lived he was tolerant at<br>his death he confessed<br>that he had squandered his life<br>uselessly<br>for my colleagues in theology protest<br>that i am character<br>caricaturing their work i hasten to<br>defend myself on two counts first these<br>are not my words<br>uh but the words of voltaire in his uh<br>mocking portrait of a theologian uh in<br>his philosophical dictionary first<br>published in 1764.<br>secondly his word seemed to me to<br>represent much more closely the work of<br>someone in my discipline<br>the science of religion the academic<br>study of religion or ligands of<br>issenshaft<br>than somebody in theirs i begin with<br>voltaire tonight because it was with<br>voltaire that i began<br>uh in the 18th century my work has only<br>gone backwards<br>since then extending to the 16th<br>and the 17th century<br>voltaire was a very interesting figure<br>and i came to him through the studies<br>that john mentioned<br>at lancaster where i studied religious<br>studies and philosophy<br>in the religious studies program i<br>studied mostly philosophy of religion<br>and that for meant that i spent much of<br>my time reading<br>these figures from the 18th century<br>onwards so not only voltaire but hume<br>and kant hegel kekegord<br>and nietzsche a key figure<br>in my training there was<br>john clayton a proud texan but also<br>a profoundly anglophile scholar of<br>religion<br>the tradition at lancaster was to study<br>all religions<br>equally sympathetically but also equally<br>critically<br>um clayton's particular work was on the<br>so-called theistic proofs the proofs for<br>the existence of god but like my good<br>colleague greg dawes<br>he regarded persuading somebody that who<br>doesn't already believe<br>that gods exist through these proofs was<br>probably the most<br>the least interesting of the motives for<br>advancing uh these proofs<br>what clayton did was to look at what the<br>proofs uh how the proofs were used<br>not to convince people who who didn't<br>believe but however they were used<br>within religions<br>so they're used for example<br>hermeneutically to clarify the meaning<br>of a text<br>or polemically not against atheists but<br>against other members of the same<br>tradition<br>to show that if you began from blogs as<br>premises you would inevitably end up in<br>atheism<br>we all know that atheism is not true and<br>therefore blogs premises<br>are are false so<br>clayton did this not just within the<br>western tradition<br>but across three major traditions the<br>indian tradition<br>the islamic tradition and the christian<br>tradition uh<br>sorry the european tradition both<br>christian and jewish<br>so for clayton uh he was interested in<br>looking at these um<br>uh proofs and comparing the work of hume<br>uh<br>not just with uh his his his rivals but<br>also with his<br>uh with ra manager an important um uh<br>early<br>medieval uh south indian uh philosopher<br>he compared al anselm not only with<br>al-ghazali but also with udayana<br>another lesser-known indian philosopher<br>and this was this was very inspiring for<br>me as an undergraduate and i was very<br>keen<br>to participate in what clayton regarded<br>as a cross-cultural<br>philosophy of religion something much<br>deeper than<br>what goes on in most philosophy of<br>religion<br>in his own ipl which is the first that i<br>attended clayton contrasted<br>the enlightenment model which in the end<br>served by rational debate as achievement<br>of consensus<br>with the indian model where the goal is<br>not the achievement of consensus but the<br>clarification of difference<br>so i was interested in in participating<br>in his project<br>but i thought that at first i needed a<br>much deeper grounding in the western<br>tradition my own knowledge i said my own<br>study had been mostly in the modern<br>period<br>at his recommendation i went to<br>cambridge there you go ben<br>ben loves hearing me talk about<br>cambridge<br>you've we've heard a lot recently about<br>the oxford vaccine but cambridge has not<br>been left behind<br>cambridge is also developing a vaccine<br>it just talks and talks and talks about<br>its time at cambridge until eventually<br>the virus<br>cambridge was a wonderful place but the<br>tradition of the study of religion there<br>was very different<br>from what i had known at lancaster which<br>was really all i knew<br>of the academic study of religion at<br>lancaster all religions whatever else<br>they were<br>were first of all to be studied at<br>something that human beings do<br>cambridge had a much more traditional<br>theological approach fortunately i was<br>not required to attend any lectures i<br>was free to attend lectures wherever i<br>like and most of them that i went to<br>were outside of the divinity faculty<br>michael tanner lecturing on nietzsche<br>patrick boyd literally on renaissance<br>art john smith<br>teaching sanskrit but i couldn't help<br>but think about<br>where these two traditions that i've<br>been exposed to the lancaster tradition<br>and the cambridge tradition<br>came from and how they had diverged from<br>another and i think it was in the 18th<br>century<br>that they they diverged key work in this<br>respect is david hume's natural history<br>of religion<br>hume despite his reputation as the great<br>infidel<br>was actually very cautious and the only<br>reason he felt able to publish<br>the natural history of religion was<br>because of the distinction that he makes<br>at the beginning<br>between the historical causes of belief<br>why people believe what they do and the<br>rational grounds<br>for belief whether it's rational for<br>them to believe those things<br>and he was explicit that in this text he<br>was looking only<br>at the historical causes of belief<br>he left his account his very skeptical<br>account of the rational grounds for<br>belief in his dialogues concerning<br>natural religion for a work which was<br>only published<br>posthumously the natural history of<br>religion was published<br>in 1757 uh the same year in which<br>in india the east india company's army<br>under robert clive defeated the armies<br>of the nawab of bengal<br>udallah at placi which is about 150<br>kilometers north of calcutta this was<br>just one battle but it's conventionally<br>taken to mark the transition of the east<br>india company<br>from a trading company to a territorial<br>power<br>and with that the establishment of<br>british colonialism in india<br>this was obviously part of a much wider<br>move expansion<br>and colonization by european powers<br>one consequence of which was the<br>increasing number of accounts of<br>different religions of the world which<br>began to flow in uh<br>to europe at this time as i said there<br>were many of these accounts and<br>then they went back to the previous<br>centuries but it's very striking that<br>voltaire<br>in his portrait of the theologian places<br>the brahmins at the head<br>of the list of those whose ancient rites<br>his theologian had squandered his life<br>trying to make sense of and<br>one of the reasons for this one of the<br>reasons voltaire was so interested in<br>these reports<br>was because he thought that they showed<br>uh the priority<br>of indian religion that it was older<br>than the christian revelation and he was<br>therefore particularly excited<br>when toward the end of 1760 he received<br>a copy of what he believed or perhaps he<br>chose to believe<br>a was a french translation of the four<br>vedas<br>the vaders are the oldest and most<br>authoritative of the hindu<br>sacred text and you can see the reason<br>that he was so excited about this was<br>because it antidates pythagoras and by<br>extension therefore also<br>the christian revelation by several<br>centuries so it was one another of the<br>sticks that he<br>wanted to use to beat the church<br>and this takes us an example of how a<br>lot of these accounts of<br>indian religion were used in europe they<br>were put to work in debates<br>first of all between catholics and<br>protestants and then between<br>christians and freethinkers deists and<br>others like voltaire<br>so the texts produced in this encounter<br>have formed the primary focus<br>of my research which is to say rather<br>than squandering my life studying the<br>ancient rights of nations<br>i have instead spent it studying those<br>who squandered their lives<br>studying the ancient rites of the<br>brahmanas the chaldeans<br>and the egyptians<br>my colleague greg is fond of mentioning<br>an incident a famous incident where<br>geshem sholum<br>who was a pioneer in the academic study<br>of the kabbalah or jewish mysticism<br>in 57 sholum was invited to lecture<br>at the jewish theological seminary a<br>famously rationalist institution in new<br>york<br>saul lieberman i was a leading talmudic<br>scholar<br>famously introduced his lecture by<br>noticing by noting that the kabbalah<br>is complete nonsense he said nonsense is<br>nonsense<br>but the history of nonsense that is<br>science<br>like lieberman i would defend the value<br>of academic inquiry apart from any<br>instrumental or utilitarian value it<br>might also happen to have<br>but i believe that my own work and the<br>work of my colleagues in the academic<br>study of religion is also valuable for<br>other reasons<br>one of the primary challenges of our<br>contemporary world is how we are to live<br>together<br>with those who are different from us<br>there are several different approaches<br>that we might take to this question<br>of cultural difference one is what i<br>like to call the walt disney<br>world view in movie after movie<br>we learn that despite our surface<br>differences our names<br>our faces our skin color underneath<br>we're all similar<br>and fundamentally we all want the same<br>things<br>love and liberal democracy<br>it doesn't matter whether you have fins<br>or feet we love you for who you are on<br>the inside<br>as a little mermaid put it now this is<br>nice to think but it does have the<br>effect of flattening<br>if not denying entirely the significance<br>of cultural difference<br>what if we don't all want liberal<br>democracy what do we do with those<br>how do we and how do we how would we<br>know<br>ten years ago uh joseph henry stephen<br>hein and ariah norenzein identified a<br>related problem<br>in the behavioral sciences and that is<br>that the experimental subjects<br>of 96 of the studies published in top<br>psychology journals were<br>despite some efforts to address this and<br>john shaver's work is a notable example<br>in a recent article henrikhadel<br>concluded that the needle hasn't moved<br>most publications still rely mostly or<br>entirely on western<br>educated industrialized rich and<br>so there's a there's a problem here<br>there's a denial of cultural difference<br>and this is now extended uh to uh even<br>to the the<br>the medical sciences as you know there's<br>been a lot of studies that have drawn<br>attention recently<br>henrik and his colleagues are at pains<br>to point out that they do not intend to<br>imply the absence of a shared human<br>nature<br>but they do think that there's a problem<br>in generalizing about that human nature<br>entirely on the basis of studies of what<br>is not only historically but even in our<br>own time<br>an entirely unrepresentative sample of<br>humanity the western educated<br>industrialized<br>now this is a<br>highly charged area as jeffrey lloyd a<br>cambridge philosopher<br>points out any denial of psychic unity<br>he says savers of racism<br>and on the other hand the assertion of<br>psychic diversity<br>raises the specter of arbitrary<br>relativism of the incommensability of<br>belief systems<br>and possibly their mutual<br>unintelligibility<br>so this is the problem of of<br>cross-cultural understanding we either<br>project<br>from a small sample or a potential<br>problem or<br>we end up worrying being unable to<br>communicate at all<br>for ted slingerland the second specter<br>that<br>lloyd raises here is for him the logical<br>outcome of the kind of strong cultural<br>constructivism<br>which has dominated much thinking in the<br>humanities since the 1970s<br>and a very prominent example of this<br>important for my own work<br>was of course edward saeed's book<br>orientalism<br>although saeeds claim that orientalism<br>has systematically distorted european<br>views of asia depends logically on being<br>able to judge<br>these views by contrast to an<br>undistorted view<br>at times like here he states a rather<br>stronger position<br>which would seem to undermine any<br>possibility of genuine understanding of<br>others<br>i think it's no accident um that uh<br>sling lin points out if you take this<br>view if you if you<br>insist on the uh the embeddedness of our<br>views in our own language<br>there's a tendency in emphasizing the<br>difference between cultures<br>to over emphasize uniformity within<br>cultures<br>as he says here if language determines<br>thought then everybody who speaks a<br>particular language must think more or<br>less<br>the same things and i think you can see<br>this in in my own area<br>some of those who've been most strident<br>about the failure of europeans to<br>understand<br>india are also those who have insisted<br>on<br>a very high degree of uniformity in<br>their presentation of indian culture<br>and the clearest example of this is that<br>a number of them exist<br>excuse me reject the existence of caste<br>altogether<br>and they say it simply doesn't exist and<br>thereby they deny<br>the existence of caste discrimination<br>but i think there's something of a false<br>dichotomy here um<br>the idea of the mutual intelligibility<br>of<br>of cultures is based upon an idea of<br>culture that i that i<br>i think is false okay cultures are not<br>pure<br>bubbles they have been in exchange with<br>one another entangled<br>to use a popular recent way of<br>characterizing it<br>for as long as they've been in existence<br>so denying the purity of a culture<br>also opens up pathways to successful<br>mutual understanding because we share<br>at least something between our cultures<br>it does all suggest however that we can<br>be more or less successful<br>in that attempt at understanding so how<br>do we know<br>when we attempt uh to understand across<br>cultures how do we know that we've been<br>successful and we aren't merely imposing<br>our own<br>understanding or misunderstanding well<br>and seeking to understand others we're<br>also seeking to understand ourselves<br>i think this is true by definition uh to<br>understand what is different we also<br>need to understand what it is different<br>from<br>but charles taylor insists that we also<br>have to add a historical depth<br>to this our past he says is sedimented<br>in our present<br>we are doomed to misun identify<br>ourselves<br>as long as we can't do justice to where<br>we come from<br>so history is essential after all<br>for taylor the contemporary atlantic<br>world our culture broadly speaking<br>he says is one culture or group of<br>closely related cultures<br>which is to be contrasted with all<br>others<br>including its own predecessor<br>civilization that is to say the past is<br>another country<br>okay i'm thinking about it that way i<br>believe both of these claims to be true<br>in general but i want to address them<br>here from a personal perspective<br>we live in a time when there is a demand<br>for reckoning with the past<br>as john told you i was born in what was<br>then rhodesia<br>he didn't have the cute photos to show<br>especially<br>i remember when the statue of cecil<br>rhodes<br>was removed from the crossroads at main<br>street and eighth avenue in bulawayo<br>shortly after independence in 1980<br>the bolo air statue was three blocks<br>from the main street methodist church<br>where my parents were married where i<br>was baptized and where my father served<br>as minister<br>from 1980 until 1984.<br>my mother as you heard was born in<br>botswana my father migrated to rhodesia<br>in 1951.<br>they were liberals in the vein of<br>garfield todd a graduate of this<br>university<br>and a protestant missionary who in the<br>1950s became prime minister<br>of rhodesia some kiwis don't believe<br>this<br>but a kiwi was prime minister of<br>religion but my parents remained in<br>rhodesia throughout the period in which<br>ian smith rolled back the modest moves<br>that todd had made<br>to extend the franchise amongst black<br>rhodesians<br>and they remained in their pews in the<br>methodist main street methodist church<br>when black members of their church were<br>removed from the building<br>for attempting to worship together with<br>their fellow white methodists<br>rather than in their methodist church<br>now my parents were decent people i<br>think<br>but that makes it harder not easier to<br>understand how they squared<br>their christian faith with their life in<br>i was eight at independence when the<br>franchise was extended<br>to all and my primary school became<br>integrated<br>so the choice of whether to oppose white<br>minority rule was never exactly forced<br>upon me<br>although i cannot say that i questioned<br>it<br>let's experience this background was not<br>part of the cons<br>my conscious choice to study the<br>attitudes of a colonizing people<br>towards the religion of a colonised<br>people but it's hard to resist the<br>conclusion that at some level<br>this is what i've been addressing<br>every great philosophy according to<br>nietzsche is a kind of involuntary<br>and unconscious autobiography i make no<br>claims to be<br>a great philosopher therefore he endeth<br>the autobiography<br>one way of seeking to improve our<br>attempts at cross-cultural understanding<br>is to examine earlier attempts of the<br>same kind<br>this is alex's favorite part of the<br>lecture<br>enter bartolomeus ziegenberg a grumpy<br>german<br>with a perpetual bellyache and a pious<br>disposition but an interesting scholar<br>ziegenbach was a lutheran missionary in<br>south india<br>in the heartland of the traditional<br>religious culture of<br>tamil nadu from 1705 until his premature<br>death<br>he wrote two significant books on<br>hinduism<br>neither of which was published in his<br>lifetime<br>but what makes him particularly<br>exceptional is that he<br>cites his sources not just<br>in general some of his peers at the time<br>jesuit missionaries and others would say<br>in one of their books it says<br>but with a very german pedanticness on<br>the third line of the fourth leaf<br>of this text it reads so he really cites<br>his sources very closely<br>many of the texts that he read he<br>collected a library of about 150 texts<br>in tamil uh are well known but the one<br>that was most important for him and that<br>which he said was the most important of<br>all hindu texts<br>has never been heard of by anybody else<br>as far as i can determine<br>this is a text that he names as a<br>tirikala chakram the title means<br>something like the three cycles of time<br>the past present and future he says this<br>book shows the genealogy of their great<br>idols how all the gods are derived from<br>the being of all beings the highest god<br>so for zekenbag it was by reading this<br>book that he came to understand how the<br>many gods in the hindu pantheon relate<br>to one another<br>but also how he came to be convinced<br>that despite all appearances hindus are<br>fundamentally monotheists that is they<br>believe in in just one<br>deity so he says this<br>that shows the genealogy of their gods<br>and then his mature work his second work<br>on hinduism uh written five years after<br>he wrote that characterization of the<br>text<br>he entitled the genealogy of the<br>malabarian gods that is the tamil<br>gods so given his account of this<br>titikala chakram which he thought was<br>this very important text<br>i wondered about the relationship<br>between the tirikana chakram<br>and his own text and at this time i was<br>in germany<br>where i was studying in the archive of<br>the mission that sent<br>sigenbaug out and you can see on the<br>left here their copy<br>of the manuscript which is in pretty bad<br>condition but fortunately there's<br>another copy<br>it's much easier to read in the royal<br>library<br>in copenhagen when i was as i was<br>working on these texts<br>a critical edition of the genealogy was<br>was published<br>by an indian scholar daniel j raj and he<br>suggests that in this text zeegenbaum<br>takes the idea of hindu monotheism<br>from a dutch text by whoops<br>philip balder a dutch chaplain who had<br>worked in sri lanka<br>and had written an account of a travel<br>account which included an account of<br>religion<br>uh he said also that<br>chickenbuck had taken the idea of a<br>genealogy uh from the renaissance work<br>boccaccio's<br>guinea oligia de oram gentillium uh and<br>the structure of his text from a<br>recently published<br>account of greco-roman mythology also a<br>sort of<br>pantheistic tradition in an early 18th<br>century text<br>now zekenbag had read baldur but he<br>dismissed his work as inaccurate<br>because balder didn't know tamil and<br>didn't read any texts it wasn't based on<br>textual study<br>there's no evidence that he'd read<br>either picacho or<br>this text by benjamin hederich which was<br>actually published after segenberg had<br>left for india<br>so i thought it was much better to look<br>at siegenbugs actual sources those that<br>he carefully cites<br>in his in his own work<br>when i arrived at otago shortly after<br>this i was required as part of my<br>confirmation to successfully obtain a<br>grant<br>either from the university or from<br>beyond so i applied to the university to<br>go on a wild goose chase<br>to find the tirikala chakram and very<br>generously the research committee of the<br>university of otago provided me some<br>money<br>now according to hikatinga this was my<br>indiana jones<br>period in which uh with my<br>faithful sidekick uh ilakavan i roamed<br>the plains of south india on a mighty<br>enfield bullet<br>swam across rivers in the jungle uh<br>pursued aged<br>scholars in caves and back alleyways<br>all seeking for hints on how we could<br>find a long-lost text written<br>on palm leaves so nobody in the three<br>hundred years since<br>bug had ever mentioned the text that he<br>thought was the most important of all<br>their texts<br>were they with ilakavan's help then i<br>would never have found it without it<br>eventually uh we did find the text we<br>found it not in a cave or in the jungle<br>but in the government oriental<br>in chennai we're basically where you<br>but we had a lot of fun here the<br>obstacles however come are not nazi<br>treasure hunters<br>as for indiana jones or hindu fanatics<br>or soviet spies but a much more fearsome<br>opponent the indian bureaucrat the text<br>was also hard to find because it's not a<br>freestanding text it's a section of a<br>larger text<br>kind of cosmological work called the<br>bhuvana chakram or the cycle of worlds<br>when we finally found this text and this<br>is it and we sat down to read it<br>together<br>it became clear that not only did<br>segenberg use it to structure his own<br>text<br>but that he provided a full translation<br>of the text so we could immediately<br>confirm that this was the text that he<br>uh he identified<br>and at the beginning of his uh his<br>genealogy or<br>guinea alleghe um is a table which lays<br>out the structure of the work<br>but also the structure of the hindu<br>pantheon so it shows the<br>the it lists and it orders the many<br>forms in which god appears<br>in the hindu tradition the table<br>directly inverts the structure of the<br>tri-kala chakram so as i said this is<br>the cycle of the three times<br>it shows the divisions of time by<br>beginning with the lifetimes of the<br>of the of the lowest deities the the<br>sort of celestial beings that are not<br>quite gods<br>um and counts the higher deities in<br>multiples of their lifetime okay so you<br>work your way up until you get up to the<br>final form which is actually<br>um uh eternal uh<br>the the being who is beyond the beyond<br>okay and seeking inverts this and works<br>downwards from<br>as you would expect perhaps from a<br>christian from the the primary god<br>through the through the pantheon<br>his version follows also some south<br>indian<br>accounts where this is a this is how the<br>world was created so first you have this<br>transcendent being<br>emerging from the transcendent being you<br>have an androgynous but material form<br>uh which then divides into male and<br>female powers<br>um and then produces um uh gods<br>so the first section this is the first<br>of four sections is i would call this a<br>matter of of kind of learned theology<br>or elite theology in the hindu tradition<br>at the next level we have the three<br>murti the so-called hindu trinity<br>shiva vishnu and brahma and their<br>consorts and offspring so this is the<br>level of kind of popular but also to<br>some extent<br>elite mythology<br>the next level down you have daily<br>worship these are the grammar devata<br>all the village deities mostly goddesses<br>or fierce male figures uh<br>in some occasions and then finally at<br>the lowest level<br>you have beings who we might describe as<br>celestials<br>the famous 333 million devas appear here<br>along with various others the guardians<br>of the different directions<br>and so on so taking a look far from<br>from taking the idea of monotheism or<br>the idea of genealogy from his european<br>sources is actually following very<br>patiently and very closely<br>his indian sources but to know that you<br>have to re-rediscover his own<br>indian sources among which was this one<br>text<br>now i said he was unusual in the<br>precision with which he cited his<br>sources but was he unusual also amongst<br>europeans and following his sources<br>following indian sources rather than<br>projecting his own ideas<br>onto indian culture well i think<br>to some extent that he was unusual but<br>he wasn't unique<br>and to finish i want to just mention<br>briefly uh<br>one more interesting case it takes us<br>back uh to the 18th century<br>and this is john zephaniah wholewell<br>an interesting figure he was the s<br>uh the grandson of a famous astrologer<br>so perhaps had an interest in<br>in religion in his upbringing but he<br>spent most of his life as<br>a colonial official in the east india<br>company<br>if you are of a certain age you've<br>probably heard of the black hole of<br>calcutta you may even have heard of it<br>and not know anything about where this<br>phrase came from<br>but this was the the attack on the east<br>india company's fort in 1756<br>which immediately precipitated the war<br>or the the<br>the campaign led by robert clive which<br>resulted in in the british colonization<br>of bengal<br>and the this incident has become<br>notorious<br>because it was taken to be<br>representative of the cruelty of<br>the rulers of bengal<br>the accounts of it almost all of them go<br>back to holwell<br>and the most sober scholarships suggest<br>that it was mostly made up or at least<br>very greatly exaggerated<br>so holdwell was a liar a famous liar<br>but he also wrote an account of hinduism<br>in his<br>interesting historical events relative<br>to the provinces of bengal which he<br>published after his return<br>to england and it was the account of<br>hinduism in this text that became one of<br>the key sources<br>for voltaire partly because of his<br>early nature of hinduism<br>now more recently it's been suggested<br>that holwell<br>he claimed in his account of hinduism to<br>be translating texts<br>which unfortunately he had lost in the<br>sack of calcutta in the black hole and<br>therefore could not<br>anymore produce but he remembered enough<br>of them or he recovered bits of them and<br>was able to provide them more recent<br>scholars have<br>claimed that as he lied about the whole<br>of calcutta so he simply made up<br>uh the texts that he claimed to be<br>translating<br>um there are various levels of the<br>argument here but i just want to focus<br>on one of them which has been advanced<br>by swiss scholar ors<br>up who suggests that the prominence of<br>angels in<br>whole worlds text is a very strange<br>account of hindu angels<br>shows the influence of a radical english<br>deist jacob ilive<br>um who published uh that who taught that<br>this earth is hell as you can see in the<br>in his title page of his work here<br>and that we are angels trapped here um<br>to<br>to as punishment for our sins and that<br>ultimately our destiny is to go off and<br>live on other planets and<br>and and rule them so some kind of weird<br>sort of new agey<br>kind of stuff going on here<br>and holwell had read ilive and he does<br>make a lot of angels but i think the<br>reason that holwell mentions angels in<br>his text<br>is not because he was copying ilive but<br>rather because he was relying on an<br>earlier tradition<br>and an earlier phase of cross-cultural<br>encounter that was very important for<br>the british<br>in india well into the 19th century<br>so it's more likely i think that whole<br>world was using not<br>ilive but a sanskrit text but not<br>directly<br>but rather via a persian translation<br>and a persian translation made through<br>the medium of an oral hindi<br>kind of intermediary okay and this is<br>the standard method by which<br>the mughals the muslim rulers of india<br>for several centuries before the british<br>had translated texts so this is a a leaf<br>from an illustrated text the<br>version of the mahabharata translated<br>for akbar the great and you can't quite<br>see it but in the front of the picture<br>there<br>um you see one scholar pointing to<br>another who's writing something down<br>what's interesting is that the this is<br>they were translating into persian you<br>can see persian script<br>uh at the operation at the top and<br>bottom of the painting<br>but in the in the middle there he's<br>writing down in uh devanagari the<br>character used for hindi<br>right um so he's actually this is the<br>i surmise that this is an indian scholar<br>giving an<br>oral account in hindi and the persian<br>scholar is writing it down<br>in hindi and then subsequently will be<br>translated and presented to akbar<br>in persian okay and in these texts<br>the word for angel deva in<br>in hindi but pronounced in the bengali<br>fashion<br>debta this is translated as a shining<br>one<br>but for muslim scholars the fact that<br>there were multiple devas meant they<br>couldn't use the word god<br>they couldn't talk about the multiple<br>gods so they translated instead using<br>the word<br>uh for angel and this whole well then<br>following this persian text<br>um talk this is why he talked about<br>angels in hindu mythology<br>and the angel there are no angels in in<br>hindu mythology but the devas do<br>regularly get themselves cursed to be<br>born on earth<br>one of ari's favorite stories from the<br>mahabharata<br>tells us the story i don't have time to<br>tell the story but uh<br>it's uh it's a very common episode that<br>the davis do get trapped so i think<br>that holwell ii was probably following<br>his sources but would have to find those<br>sources<br>what i've tried to suggest is that what<br>distinguishes those european writers who<br>came closest to understanding indian<br>religion is their painstaking study<br>of texts and this is the boring truth<br>that is the same for us today<br>if we really want to understand others<br>i'm afraid there is no substitute for<br>learning their languages<br>and patiently reading their texts<br>having quoted several great philosophers<br>voltaire hume<br>the little mermaid i close with another<br>the university of otago and the new<br>zealand taxpayer<br>have allowed me the great privilege of<br>spending much of my working life<br>studying the errors of the past the rest<br>my name is tony valentine and i'm the<br>ppc humanities here<br>at the university of otago and it's with<br>great pleasure i deliver a vote of<br>thanks<br>to professor sweetman he has delivered<br>an excellent lecture<br>a set of reflections on his own academic<br>pathway<br>and on some of the recurrent concerns<br>that stand at the center of his research<br>and teaching i think he's illuminated<br>really important disciplinary matters<br>and explored some of the questions<br>that persistently stand at the heart of<br>human life<br>almost 60 years ago now the great<br>chicago historian w h mcneil<br>argued quote encounters with strangers<br>are the main drive wheel of human<br>history<br>and this lecture has trained our<br>attention on the key dimension of such<br>encounters<br>cross-cultural understandings of<br>religion<br>considering how we understand people<br>different from us<br>and how we make sense of those who<br>follow other gods and whose languages<br>devotional practices and institutions<br>diverge from our own<br>remains an urgent undertaking that is<br>the case both at a scholarly level<br>and in terms of our day-to-day<br>navigation<br>of a world that has been made and remade<br>by shifting patterns of migration and<br>mobility<br>empire building and evangelization<br>professor sweetman has built a<br>substantial scholarly reputation in part<br>because he exhibits many of those<br>qualities that he highlighted in his<br>sketch of professor john clayton at<br>lancaster<br>especially his ability to navigate<br>between worlds<br>and we've seen this this evening<br>professor sweetman<br>has traced some key questions about how<br>we understand cultural<br>difference and the nature of religion<br>through a sequence of important<br>texts thinkers and locations<br>although i think none of us were perhaps<br>expecting<br>disney's little mermaid nor the great<br>george best<br>to be quoted but that little mermaid<br>quotation<br>is important because it underlines just<br>how fundamental<br>the questions that will is grappling<br>with are<br>he has reminded us of the value of<br>meticulous attention<br>to texts the careful interrogation of<br>their providence<br>and purchase and the crucial importance<br>of scrutinizing the ways in which they<br>are shaped<br>by their engagements with earlier texts<br>and professor sweetman has also looked<br>back on his own academic journey he's<br>taken us from<br>bulawayo to lancaster to south india<br>into our location here in the south of<br>i'd like to pick up on one thing um that<br>john<br>observed and that will touched on and<br>that<br>he well and and john and your colleagues<br>are part of an outstanding cohort of<br>scholars<br>in religious studies here at otago and<br>that's a group that<br>professor sweetman himself has been<br>pivotal in assembling<br>there is a very significant tradition of<br>the scientific study of religion at<br>otaku that dates back to the<br>late 1960s and that tradition has<br>flourished and grown in recent years<br>in ways that owe a great deal to the<br>leadership and work<br>that will has provided now ipls are<br>incredibly important events and they are<br>always a highlight for all the<br>university leaders who attend them<br>but i have to admit that this one is<br>particularly special for me<br>in part because of the convergence of my<br>own academic voyage with wills at an<br>early stage<br>at cambridge will and i worked in what<br>we might think of as an<br>adjacent intellectual neighborhood and<br>you'll notice that we have matching<br>roads as does professor blakey so we<br>worked in<br>adjacent intellectual neighborhoods if<br>you like uh his study<br>of european accounts of hinduism was<br>if you uh human me the course to fame<br>to the cherishing of my work on colonial<br>knowledge<br>in british india we were at the same<br>college<br>uh wolfson and we were part of an<br>unusually cosmopolitan team<br>of uh student porters who ran to college<br>at weekends and nights i'm thinking back<br>to that time two and a half decades now<br>i'm not only struck<br>on reflection that will at that stage<br>exhibited a deep interest and<br>questions about methodology and how we<br>understand and make sense of religion<br>but that he clearly then also exhibited<br>the same<br>warmth collegiality and wit<br>and those things stand out to me because<br>their qualities did always not<br>not always stick on the ground in<br>cambridge<br>thinking back i also remember quite<br>clearly that i had a luxuriant hit of<br>here<br>and that annoyingly in hindsight that<br>well looked almost exactly the same<br>as it does now and most importantly<br>being in john for the record i did not<br>row at cambridge<br>um as we've all seen tonight it's no<br>surprise to anyone that will is a great<br>teacher<br>he is an excellent institutional citizen<br>and he's an important leader<br>for us i know that all of us here from<br>across the university<br>and beyond are delighted to be sharing<br>this special occasion with you well<br>um so could you all please join me in<br>thanking well i have a small gift to<br>give him<br>and then i invite you to follow the<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
