accurate.</p><p>coming to the end of two very very<br>thought-provoking days uh first job i've<br>got right now<br>is to say thank you uh thank you to<br>all of you here in the room and those<br>that have been following<br>uh online i've seen questions come<br>through on slido i've also been getting<br>texts and whatsapp over the last few<br>days<br>really appreciate it thank you to all of<br>our speakers<br>online wherever you might have been in<br>the room really fantastic<br>and a great diversity of views i think<br>we can bring in even greater diversity<br>and next time we do this i hope but i've<br>really enjoyed that<br>and also a thank you to those people<br>that you might not have seen and who<br>might not have been in the room this<br>whole time pulling together<br>any event but particularly an event with<br>this many people<br>who all have busy schedules around the<br>place takes a heck of a lot of work<br>and so from the team that's doing the<br>catering to the academic leaders<br>of the divisions to everybody who's<br>pulled that together and promoted this<br>i just want to give a big round of<br>applause and thanks<br>so we said at the start that we're<br>meeting here against<br>a fascinating and extremely challenging<br>backdrop<br>not only are we facing probably the<br>generation that will define how our<br>grandchildren look at us<br>climate change environmental<br>responsibility<br>not only are we facing up against uh<br>issues of inequity and injustice<br>which i'm very glad we've touched on in<br>several different sessions over the last<br>couple of days<br>but we're going through what we're going<br>through we're going through this<br>absolutely<br>mind-bending event of covert we did<br>things one year ago in march they were<br>inconceivable<br>13 months ago in february we're now<br>living in a world that we just couldn't<br>have imagined you know<br>last new years so we're going through<br>all of that<br>and i'm very pleased reflecting on all<br>the talks that came through<br>everyone despite the diversity of<br>thoughts and ways into the issues<br>everybody who spoke over the last two<br>days was seeking to make things better<br>they might disagree on the means to get<br>there but everybody<br>is seeking to do better across a broad<br>range of measures<br>so what does that mean for us we're<br>lucky here in the room we've got a<br>significant amount of intellect<br>we also have a significant amount of<br>influence<br>and i'd say some degree people with<br>power people with the opportunity to<br>make decisions<br>and with that power and with that<br>influence comes responsibility<br>so what is our job with that<br>responsibility<br>picking up themes from the last couple<br>of days<br>three things struck me the first is to<br>take<br>a longer term and a broader view of<br>success<br>defining what we want and greater<br>relationship both with the natural<br>environment<br>with other parts of society but also<br>with future generations<br>looking both forwards and backwards over<br>time i think that came through loud and<br>clear from many of the speakers<br>let's think bigger broader and<br>particularly longer term<br>a second theme was to use the tools that<br>we have when we talk economics we can<br>mean many different things<br>but at its core it can be about choice<br>it can be about allocation it can be<br>about trade-offs<br>use the analytical tools we have and<br>let's have<br>rigorous analysis going into the<br>decisions that we have to make<br>from that you can get analysis to<br>insight to decision to action<br>and if you pair that with that first<br>point around a broader and a longer term<br>view i think we're on the right<br>we're on the right path and the third<br>point is particularly<br>near to my heart and i guess you know<br>i'm very new to the university i only<br>joined<br>from a career in business six months ago<br>but one of the reasons i did<br>make that decision was being attracted<br>to<br>an environment that is all about<br>focusing on lifting<br>and growing human capability to<br>challenge and address really chunky<br>issues so<br>on top of that broader view on top of<br>the rigorous analysis<br>let's have vigorous debate it isn't<br>always something that we're incredibly<br>good at<br>in the kiwi culture we tend to like<br>agreeing together when we're in the<br>meeting and sometimes saying what we<br>really think because we walk out the<br>door<br>um but let's bring that analysis have<br>the debate<br>it's been so good to see people on stage<br>and the questions coming through<br>actually challenging each other it<br>doesn't mean that we have to have<br>punch-ups this is not about disrespect<br>but let's bring that debate to the fore<br>because we cannot make better decisions<br>take better action<br>without a broad view the analysis and<br>the debate<br>so that's the that's the plea that's the<br>request for all of you<br>as a i guess a product of this<br>conference i've been chatting to people<br>over a cup of tea or a drink last night<br>got a really great sense of some of the<br>feedback and other issues<br>we'll be following up with you to get<br>more feedback we're really interested in<br>doing something like this again<br>or extending it out into the future we<br>believe that there is a need for<br>conversations like this so when you get<br>that uh that message coming into your<br>inbox in whatever form<br>please let us know what you'd like to<br>see what you've liked what we can do<br>better<br>again people ah you don't have to be<br>polite on that let us know what you<br>think<br>and last of all again a huge thank you<br>you</p></main><footer
