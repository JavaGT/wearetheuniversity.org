for hosting this forum and<br>for giving me the opportunity to speak<br>so as anna mentioned i'm donna purdue<br>i'm the chief economist<br>at mb and for those of you that don't<br>know me<br>i've spent most of my career as a bank<br>economist<br>and in 2015 i decided to<br>make the transition to the public sector<br>and<br>the thinking that i would go from<br>predominantly forecasting the<br>implications of policy to<br>actually having the opportunity to be<br>able to uh influence the direction of<br>policy<br>so um six years on i'm thinking that<br>that was a little bit of a naive<br>kind of idea but um i mentioned that<br>because i think<br>the conversations yesterday um really<br>did highlight to me<br>the frustration that i know many people<br>have<br>with the public sector and certainly the<br>the policy approaches that the public<br>sector uses<br>and the um session at the end of<br>yesterday<br>um you know cameron bagley and eric and<br>paul<br>you know making some comments around the<br>fact that public sector isn't<br>incentivized to take risk that we don't<br>experiment<br>and that we haven't invested necessarily<br>in the knowledge of the public sector<br>and<br>i do i do agree with that but i think<br>you know obviously in part that's<br>a reflection of the systems and the<br>institutional settings<br>and structures that we have in place but<br>also i think it's a reflection of the<br>fact<br>that we do hold this view that the<br>private sector<br>is the only sector that can create value<br>and that the public sector's only role<br>is to correct market failures to<br>de-risk and to level the playing field<br>and i think you know if any of you are<br>familiar with mariana masakado's work<br>who's influenced quite a lot of the work<br>and i'll be talking about some of the<br>um approaches that she's been looking at<br>through my conversation today but you'll<br>know that there is a significant<br>literature that's now<br>debunking that myth um and yet we still<br>largely have this view<br>that um a smaller government is better<br>and i think that<br>in times of massive transformation which<br>we we have been talking about in times<br>of disruption<br>we certainly need to challenge that view<br>i'm not saying we necessarily need a<br>bigger government but we definitely need<br>to invest<br>in a smarter more effective government<br>so having said that um in the 10 minutes<br>or so that i've got<br>let me talk to you today about the topic<br>of business innovation in a post-covered<br>world<br>and i wanted to focus on a new potential<br>policy approach that's getting some<br>traction internationally<br>that of mission lead policy but first<br>let me just give you a little bit of<br>context<br>around the case for change and i know<br>we've talked a little bit about this<br>um already over the last day or so<br>but when i'm you know looking at the<br>covert situation um<br>you know businesses clearly have adapted<br>i think quite well<br>um to covert 19. some of our research<br>that we did through our beta for<br>business team<br>uh in conjunction with uh research new<br>zealand showed that businesses took a<br>variety of strategies<br>they looked at retrenchment strategies<br>so managing labor costs<br>through reducing hours and<br>you know delaying pay increases that<br>sort of thing but also<br>some investment strategies where they<br>are taking the opportunity to invest in<br>digital technology<br>to allow more remote working or online<br>sales or contactless business<br>but when we look at the some of the big<br>challenges that that businesses are<br>facing into and i'm talking about<br>not just climate change i'm talking<br>about aging and demographic<br>change resource security scarcity<br>environmental degradation urbanization<br>technology change<br>and you look at the big transformational<br>shifts<br>that are coming out of that so things<br>around the circular economy and i know<br>liz and tom are going to talk about that<br>shortly but also<br>around well-being economy experience<br>economy<br>by growth economy and so on um there's<br>definitely a sense<br>that it's more than just um adaption<br>that we need<br>by businesses households and government<br>we need quite significant<br>change and on top of that government has<br>set some pretty bold targets<br>not just around carbon but also things<br>like<br>our child poverty targets swimmable<br>rivers are predator-free<br>having all new zealanders able to live<br>in a dry safe<br>warm home so as i said you know<br>all of these things coming together this<br>my sense is that<br>adaption's not enough and that we do<br>actually need to transform<br>quite significantly um everything that<br>we do<br>so i guess the question for me as uh the<br>chief economist<br>of mb our policy shop is um how do we do<br>those things how do we do things<br>differently how do we use<br>policy to uh catalyze an innovation in<br>order that we're able to<br>um basically make the most of the<br>opportunities of these big trends or at<br>least mitigate the risks<br>so doing things differently um from you<br>know i really think from<br>my perspective that uh rethinking the<br>role of government uh<br>is critical so when i was sitting in<br>mb in 2017 when the new<br>coalition government came in and they<br>shifted the<br>economic strategy from just being<br>focused on productivity<br>to actually focusing on productive<br>sustainable inclusive<br>growth i think that fundamentally<br>changed the way<br>policy or we needed to think about<br>policy particularly from an economic<br>development perspective<br>so we were no longer focused just on a<br>rate of growth or the productivity<br>we were now having to focus on a<br>direction of growth so<br>sustainability and inclusion and<br>i think it became quite obvious and it<br>was really tricky<br>for us to get our heads around what that<br>actually means<br>and and the sense is that we couldn't<br>rely on traditional policy approaches<br>that just<br>fixed markets um that we were looking<br>for policy approaches that allowed us to<br>shape and co-create markets so that we<br>were making sure<br>we were able to achieve that direction<br>of growth<br>and so these shaping policies or<br>co-creating type policies<br>have got the name now of um<br>so what do i mean by mission lead and so<br>the oecd<br>in january this year this year actually<br>released a paper<br>so it's reviewing around uh 40 odd<br>international<br>policy approaches in this mission-led<br>area and they would they basically did<br>the review to be able to help us<br>understand the best ways to if we're<br>going to go down this policy approach<br>the best ways to<br>uh design and implement these more<br>systemic sort of<br>policy approaches and they described<br>the um well they defined the mission-led<br>innovation as a coordinated package of<br>policy<br>and regulatory measures tailored<br>specifically to mobilize science<br>technology and innovation in order to<br>address well-defined objectives<br>and related to a societal challenge in a<br>defined time frame<br>so essentially they are purpose-led or<br>outcomes-focused policies and a key goal<br>really is to catalyze and<br>crowd in prior sector investment<br>in order for us to be able to drive that<br>sort of transformation<br>transformative innovation that we're<br>so what does it mean in practice<br>so as i mentioned a large part of it is<br>taking the view that government is no<br>longer just<br>around fixing markets not saying that<br>the market failure approaches<br>is wrong or shouldn't be used but that<br>it's no longer<br>just in that space that we are actively<br>shaping and creating<br>so it also encompasses a shift in<br>uh focus from marginal um improvements<br>driven<br>for value for money to public creation<br>driven by public purpose it also<br>uh uses different analytical frameworks<br>for policy evaluation<br>so the traditional cost-benefit analysis<br>framework<br>is replaced in favor of more dynamic<br>evaluation<br>tools that allow us to capture spillover<br>effects and structural changes<br>it requires new public sector<br>capabilities<br>and i've i heard vicky talking before<br>about<br>public sector thinking outside the<br>square or outside the box that's<br>definitely<br>in this space but it also requires a lot<br>of<br>capability around coordination<br>cooperation<br>and collaboration there<br>are governance structures required that<br>will enable a cross-sector and<br>cross-institutional<br>or cross-agency collaboration<br>they've also involved different and new<br>um<br>funding and financial instruments so<br>some of the work<br>that has been done particularly in small<br>advanced economies<br>and in europe uh they've been looking to<br>green investment banks for example um i<br>think<br>uh in scotland they've established one<br>they've been talking all these<br>recommendations for one i think<br>in norway but it's not just uh you know<br>establishing new banks it's you know<br>using things like challenge prizes<br>and particularly of interest to me<br>because of my role at mb<br>and we have government procurement there<br>are lots of options around using<br>government<br>procurement in order to drive the<br>innovation that's required<br>but i think one of the um really key<br>aspects<br>of this type of approach is that it puts<br>citizen<br>participation at the heart of the policy<br>so for new zealand with the treaty of<br>waitangi teal maori perspectives<br>and the way we need to you know bring<br>a much more collaborative um joined up<br>sort of approach i think mission-led<br>policies lend themselves well to to<br>so as i said um mariana masacato<br>has been influencing a lot of the work<br>that i've been doing in recent years<br>and her she's one of the leading<br>economists in the space<br>i would argue and she's established<br>through the<br>university college of london the<br>institute for innovation and public<br>purpose where they're doing a lot of<br>this work<br>and they've established this framework<br>that you can see here<br>um the conceptual framework of how these<br>missions work<br>so essentially they establish a grand<br>challenge<br>and from that the mission is really um<br>breaking that grand challenge down into<br>concrete targets<br>um that you know allow us to frame and<br>stimulate innovation<br>so they're essentially what connects the<br>um<br>the grand challenge and um the specific<br>projects<br>they set a direction for a solution when<br>they're established but they don't go in<br>with an<br>answer so the idea um you know that the<br>right answers are not known in advance<br>and the idea is that we get a portfolio<br>of research and innovation projects<br>across sectors um to develop a different<br>range of solutions to achieve what<br>um the the mission is and to reward<br>those actors that are willing<br>to take risks and experiment and<br>ultimately<br>it means that we're not so a lot of the<br>industry<br>policy that we've looked at in the past<br>certainly through the<br>70s 80s and 90s was very much around<br>taking a sector view so a vertical view<br>these ones of um this policy it's very<br>systemic<br>uh and it's mostly focused on<br>um you know looking at uh problems that<br>we that we really want to solve as<br>opposed to focusing on particular<br>um sectors and looking at the<br>capabilities required to to<br>so there's about five criteria<br>or um characteristics for selecting<br>missions<br>so uh they must be bold and<br>inspirational with wide societal<br>relevance they provide<br>a clear direction and and they're<br>targeted and measurable and time-bound<br>um they're ambitious um and lead to uh<br>you know research and innovation actions<br>they're cross-disciplinary<br>cross-sectoral<br>um and allow for that multi-disciplinary<br>approach they and importantly they lead<br>so i just wanted to give you an example<br>of<br>one of the mission lead frameworks that<br>was established by<br>mariana and her team at iipp um<br>so they worked with the uk government in<br>2017<br>on a an industrial strategy white paper<br>and as part of that they<br>established a series of green challenges<br>and one of them was around the future of<br>mobility<br>uh so the commission worked the um<br>marianas team worked with the department<br>for business energy<br>and industrial strategy to um<br>develop up what you know the the sort of<br>road map would look like<br>and you can see here um the actual<br>specific mission<br>was by 2040 to put the uk at the<br>forefront of safe sustainable<br>universally acceptable travel creating<br>congestion and emission-free zero<br>accident systems<br>you can see the range of sectors uh that<br>would need to be involved<br>in order to achieve this and a number of<br>possible projects<br>that could be worked on in order to<br>so i don't want to give the impression<br>that uh this is<br>that these approaches are easy um<br>certainly<br>some of the uh literature that's coming<br>out at the moment in terms of assessing<br>uh these new this new policy approach<br>and certainly the paper earlier this<br>year by<br>the oecd shows that it's definitely not<br>all plain sailing<br>so um some of the some of the<br>issues that have that have cropped up<br>are that the policy initiatives have<br>really struggled to set<br>missions with the required those five<br>characteristics or criteria<br>that the missions themselves take a<br>really long time<br>to set as it requires a gradual and<br>inclusive process<br>so their initial uh establishing<br>the mission and working through that<br>takes quite<br>a lot of time the governance structures<br>are really complex with multiple layers<br>and um at the moment there are<br>very few evaluations of some of these<br>projects that have been put in place and<br>most of the evaluations that have been<br>done<br>still rely on traditional evaluation<br>tools and methods so cba<br>and i guess the other thing is that<br>a lot of these new approaches<br>have involved quite a bit of additional<br>cost and that's mainly being due to some<br>of the complex<br>governance arrangements that are<br>required<br>and the oecd paper goes into that a bit<br>more<br>so um i know i think i've probably gone<br>well over time um but i wanted to just<br>quickly summarize<br>um so you know businesses have shown<br>surprisingly<br>resilience and ability to debt but to<br>adapt but i think you know<br>there's a lot of disruption ahead and<br>there will be a lot more need for<br>business innovation to allow us to<br>to um address some of these big<br>challenges<br>i think the mission lead policy<br>approaches are gaining traction<br>internationally and<br>and they do provide potential for us to<br>catalyze that<br>the innovation that we need and new<br>zealand definitely has the opportunity<br>to trial this approach and i have been<br>working alongside mfe with mariana<br>mazucato and her team<br>on on what some what a mission for new<br>zealand could look like<br>but as with anything new it definitely<br>comes with risk and<br>from that perspective it's absolutely<br>important that we learn from the growing<br>international evidence on the best way<br>to implement and design these policies<br>if we do decide to go down that path<br>thanks very much donna well we've got<br>les and<br>tommy you're going to make your way to<br>the stage at the moment or do you want<br>great and if we can ask liz and tom if<br>you could<br>yeah you could come and have one of<br>these seats yeah<br>um if we could ask you to keep it<br>reasonably concise so we've got a bit of<br>time for questions<br>yeah sure will okay well i'm going to<br>going to start the<br>presentation and and tom's going to add<br>um significant value to what i'm going<br>to say so i have to give a little bit of<br>genesis to what i'm going to talk about<br>um to put it into context<br>um 2018 2019 um<br>a couple of scientists in the university<br>here were wanting to<br>find out how their great ideas could um<br>change um<br>elements of um aiming towards<br>zero waste in new zealand so they got<br>all these great ideas coming out of the<br>materials<br>groups in in the university and<br>how could they get them into business<br>we'd also got the sustainable business<br>network<br>who were trying to introduce<br>uh issues and ideas related to<br>circularity and they were asking various<br>people<br>including me you know what's this<br>circularity stuff about<br>when i told this person about zero waste<br>and that zero waste was neither<br>necessary nor sufficient for increasing<br>well-being<br>in a sustainable way she was what i<br>think the common parlance is<br>gobsmacked she thought that this is all<br>you know this was a great idea um<br>when i told the sustainable business<br>network that there wasn't<br>a circular economy but there were many<br>many versions of a circular economy they<br>were sort of<br>um slightly annoyed too so<br>um what i'm going to talk about today is<br>is how that turned into<br>a project that was eventually funded by<br>by mb<br>and i'm going to throw out a number of<br>words that i hope<br>people will take offense about one of<br>them is well-being<br>one of them is circularity but i'm<br>hoping that you can see<br>how we're going to do it differently and<br>a key<br>point that's going to come through i<br>hope<br>is that we're going to be looking at<br>issues of sustainable development<br>well-being<br>and circularity within a fundamentally<br>new zealand<br>environment one where we're going to be<br>and are co-creating um these issues<br>and these ideas as we go along so we've<br>got to talk a little bit about covid<br>so kovid certainly exposed new zealand<br>to<br>supply chain issues and this is going to<br>be an element that will<br>potentially be important in<br>operationalizing any version of a<br>circular economy<br>similarly we found that new zealand<br>wasn't able to<br>access all the raw materials it normally<br>had access to because of closing the<br>borders<br>and that meant that certain industries<br>certain products were<br>left in limbo couldn't be produced<br>because they weren't available<br>domestically we know about tourists i'm<br>not going to talk anymore about that we<br>know about the effectiveness of closing<br>the borders in relation to<br>the pandemic but we know the problems of<br>closing the borders too um<br>we've already have people alluding to<br>issues that the health became<br>the only priority and many other<br>priorities were<br>seen to be dependent on on on dealing<br>with covid<br>although that was never really<br>quantified at the time and as john<br>gibson talked about yesterday<br>when we start to quantify some of these<br>things when you have a health only<br>goal you miss a lot of things along the<br>way<br>now the government has been talking<br>about this government's been talking<br>about<br>transformation and donna was talking<br>about transformation too<br>but there's no real evidence that the<br>government has any plan at all<br>for what sort of transformation that<br>we're talking about<br>it seems i think the interest in this uh<br>workshop this<br>this forum is that many of you probably<br>all of you are in the same position that<br>you don't know what the government's<br>planning to do with postcovid either<br>we don't really have a plan<br>well-being is probably going to come<br>back onto the agenda but well-being<br>taking a point from arthur grimes who<br>couldn't be here well-being has been a<br>function of government behavior since<br>the 1890s<br>well-being and well-being budgets are<br>not new<br>it's just that the term well-being is<br>when i was talking to the scientists<br>they didn't quite understand<br>that there are many different versions<br>of sustainability<br>and i've done some work with a few<br>people looking at sustainable<br>development in new zealand<br>getting some numbers taking the four<br>pillars taking measures of natural<br>physical<br>um and uh human capital and not<br>surprisingly<br>what have we been doing since the 1950s<br>has not<br>been sustainable in a development sense<br>for new zealand we've not been saving<br>enough<br>now that's not rocket science to many of<br>us but when you look at the numbers<br>you can see that we've not been acting<br>so here is um a very brief overview of<br>what we're trying to do under this title<br>of<br>a miyami ateroa a circular economy for<br>new zealand<br>and the thing that's really important in<br>terms of this structure<br>is that none of the scientists and none<br>of the business people that we talked<br>about<br>really understood what the goal of this<br>sort of transformation<br>this view of the economy was about they<br>talked about<br>circularity as the means and the end<br>in its own right when i told them<br>that what we should be looking for when<br>i told them when i talked to them about<br>this<br>ultimately we're looking for things that<br>increase well-being<br>and we increase well-being over time<br>now well-being one of those<br>buzzy sort of words but as i said<br>well-being budgets have been around<br>for 120 odd years<br>it's just what we've put into well-being<br>as a measure that's changed over time<br>what we're doing right at this time<br>tom and i and a few extra colleagues of<br>tom<br>is that we are not simply taking a<br>measure of well-being that we've picked<br>up from<br>an oecd or a finland<br>or a norwegian or a scottish version of<br>what wellbeing<br>is about but we're co-creating those<br>that measure and co-creation is one<br>where we're taking<br>some of the best things from a western<br>science a pakeha version of well-being<br>but informed by and intertwined with<br>maori notions of well-being and we're<br>along the way to generating something<br>that is a specifically new zealand<br>measure of well-being<br>but it will look familiar<br>in terms of including issues to do with<br>wealth<br>issues to do with employment issues to<br>do with<br>income more broadly<br>but it will be something that we can<br>measure and one thing that we were<br>determined to do<br>and are determined to do is to come up<br>with ideas that are measurable<br>and one of the problems that treasury<br>has found particularly with things like<br>the living standards framework<br>is that when they try and bring in<br>notions which are inherently<br>moray in terms of their intrinsic values<br>all that happens is there's an attempt<br>to bolt on some maori stuff<br>and then that maori stuff becomes very<br>hard to monetize<br>so it doesn't really go anywhere what<br>we're doing here is we're sort of<br>bringing it up<br>from the bottom up and um tom<br>is is a great advocate for taking<br>the good form of western idea and i'm<br>getting better at understanding how to<br>take good stuff<br>from a maori perspective and this<br>co-creation<br>is not only sort of great fun but it's<br>the other thing that seemed to be a<br>problem for for businesses and<br>scientists was understanding this idea<br>of sustainable development<br>they'd heard sustainable and used the<br>word sustainable<br>probably hundreds of times a month but<br>they all meant different things<br>and it very very very rarely was an<br>intertemporal issue<br>as far as they were concerned they were<br>just thinking about it<br>is it sustainable for this year now<br>what's it going to do to the balance<br>sheet<br>we are not being that inventive in<br>thinking about our concept of<br>sustainable development<br>it's a bruntland notion of sustainable<br>development<br>development that meets the needs of the<br>present without compromising the ability<br>of future generations to meet their own<br>needs<br>now the word needs is pretty loaded<br>but what we can do in a new zealand<br>context is is<br>incorporate needs from a maori<br>perspective from a pakiha perspective<br>make something that is really<br>focused on um new zealand<br>then we come to the the circular economy<br>again i told them there could be many<br>many versions of<br>the circular economy it really depends<br>on<br>uh the particular structures in new<br>zealand it depends upon<br>um the the prices in new zealand it<br>depends on resources in new zealand<br>the basic idea of the circular economy<br>is it<br>it's trying to identify<br>an optimal level of loop closing that's<br>where the circularity part comes from<br>and in particular what they're looking<br>for is trying to minimize<br>the um or the models out there trying to<br>minimize the amount of what they call<br>virgin raw materials<br>non-renewables as far as they're<br>thinking about them although they<br>they sometimes put in trees which seems<br>to be really weird<br>so what you're trying to do is is<br>minimize<br>waste i don't like the word waste i like<br>the word byproduct<br>waste seems to suggest it doesn't have<br>any value<br>and extending product life maintaining<br>materials at their highest<br>value level optimizing reuse and<br>utilizing energy sources as a strategy<br>to<br>to to close these<br>material loops so there's some there's<br>some<br>issues that are common to circular<br>economy notions<br>but there's different ways of making<br>this work<br>how are we approaching this<br>well we put together a team which were<br>given<br>responsibilities for three basic<br>elements of the project one is looking<br>at<br>well-being measures that are tailored<br>for<br>informed by agreed by different<br>elements of new zealand society in<br>particular western and maori notions<br>and it's not at all hard when we start<br>to think of<br>sustainable development in this space<br>because<br>intergenerational in their philosophy<br>the idea that intergenerational transfer<br>which seemed to be something that was um<br>a little bit difficult for some new<br>zealand businesses to be thinking about<br>is a fundamental maori notion<br>so that's not hard to bring in we've got<br>a bunch of material scientists the<br>people that started off this this whole<br>questions<br>who have who are producing new products<br>new processors and those new products<br>and new processors<br>will not only be generated within the<br>university and flipped out there<br>but the idea is and the the third group<br>has this responsibility<br>is that what businesses would want<br>would feed back into the university<br>system into these materials people<br>and it can be a two-way street<br>and the third group is a set of<br>management and economists<br>who are actually looking at uh how these<br>new materials how these new products<br>how these new innovations coming both<br>ways<br>how they get embedded into the real<br>world<br>and working with businesses in what i<br>regard as a proof-of-concept idea where<br>basically<br>um these new materials i'll come out um<br>come on to this as a closing line how<br>these new materials<br>can be incorporated into businesses<br>in a way that is going to be profitable<br>for businesses but still has this notion<br>of circularity built into it<br>not only reducing waste but also<br>leading to new innovations where these<br>by-products this waste becomes<br>in itself an input that is creating new<br>products<br>so it's not just a matter of making a<br>business more efficient and having less<br>waste<br>but building in this idea that that<br>byproduct<br>can lead to new products itself<br>and the the third group is going to go<br>backwards and forwards case studies<br>working with the the materials group to<br>find out you know what are the areas<br>what are the materials<br>that are most uh desirable<br>for new zealand business now<br>because we've only got a little bit of<br>money and because we've only got five<br>years we're going to focus on two areas<br>that we think are really important<br>one is in terms of building materials<br>and the other is in terms of packaging<br>so on the packaging side we have issues<br>to do with<br>health and safety on the materials side<br>we have difficulties of recycling some<br>of these things because<br>they might not be biodegradable they may<br>well be in the material that is not<br>easily<br>uh able to be recycled in a way<br>recycling always leads to a<br>reduction in the quality of the recycled<br>product<br>so when you're recycling plastics<br>the next level down the plastics from<br>food packaging<br>is going to be of a lower quality and a<br>lower quality and a lower quality<br>as you go through when you're recycling<br>paper they often end up as sort of<br>cardboard boxes<br>end up as egg boxes and go down the<br>system<br>so the value as they're recycled tends<br>to decline<br>in the way that they're being reused now<br>but there's no reason why we can't think<br>of these by-products<br>having a much higher value use in terms<br>of a more innovative use<br>than simply recycling and recycling all<br>the way through<br>when it comes to building materials and<br>at least the vice chance is not here<br>anymore final point coming up now<br>this this love affair with concrete<br>is just absolutely crazy it's<br>probably one of the most energy<br>intensive ways of building anything<br>and we've got lots of trees and we have<br>lots of technology about the<br>load-bearing<br>strength of laminated wood<br>and in france many new<br>public investments have to use i think<br>up to at least sorry 20 percent<br>of their load-bearing structure has to<br>come from renewables<br>i.e wood so this this<br>this is why we're looking at to what<br>extent can the building sector<br>deal with different types of building<br>methods and still be safe<br>and in terms of uh trying to recycle<br>concrete<br>i don't know if you've ever tried to<br>smash up a bit of concrete and use it<br>for something else<br>but it's not at all easy to see what<br>else you're going to do<br>apart from maybe stick it at the bottom<br>of a new road<br>and then again we've got to be sure that<br>we want that new road<br>uh whereas with renewals with trees we<br>can grow more<br>and the buildings probably look a lot<br>nicer<br>dare i say no i'm not going to say the<br>next one anyway anna's given me the the<br>wrap up so far so i'm going to pass over<br>to<br>to tom i'm sure there'll be questions<br>please don't be polite<br>here you go they're going to put the new<br>for those of you who have an<br>understanding of maori<br>you all know that roa means long we need<br>to<br>and i promise you i'm not going to be<br>long there you go<br>so in discussing the circular economy<br>um is a word that means circular<br>but it's not that kind of circle which<br>closes in on itself<br>it's more dynamic and it can go<br>in all sorts of different ways and so<br>this circular economy is not just in<br>terms of a circle<br>but much more dynamic and how we might<br>treat<br>that's that's you that's me don't worry<br>can we put the other set of slides on i<br>gave you for says<br>tom tom and miami<br>here we are no that's still that's still<br>there there we go yeah<br>so in terms of a covert knighting<br>overview<br>covered 19 a circumstance beyond our<br>control<br>to for about within which our responses<br>can be co-created co-designed co-decided<br>for the well-being of all field war new<br>zealand people and places<br>through inter and transdisciplinary<br>approaches<br>holistic where a circular economy<br>has well-being at its core and is<br>premised<br>on principles of sustainability i'm not<br>an economist<br>i got there from leaves after<br>some very vibrant and very<br>interesting conversations about<br>what is circular economy what is<br>sustainability what is<br>well-being so<br>going back into my mata ranga maori<br>i juxtapose western science<br>not just in terms of hard sciences but<br>including economics and other<br>disciplines in this idea of the western<br>world<br>with my mata ranga maori and my<br>mataranga maori<br>just as my academic career is<br>based and also informed<br>by readings and other informations<br>from within and without of new zealand<br>my mata ranga maori is premised on my<br>karakia<br>on my whakapapa on<br>where i come from in this<br>maori informed new world<br>there's a karakia which goes uh<br>and in that stanza of that correct here<br>it talks about how there's so much<br>happening in the world<br>that over which we have absolutely no<br>control<br>but we live in that world<br>it's how we respond to that<br>atuki is an adds<br>i have a long toki a tokiroa tetoki<br>i have a toki which can chop down<br>and so i chopped down all of those<br>things<br>that hold rangi in the sky<br>so that rangi<br>collapses on to papatuanuku<br>and then i use that toki to shape<br>something again<br>so that i pulled rangi back up<br>and then i chop it down again but i<br>rebuild<br>and that's part of the circular dynamic<br>just as less and in our conversations<br>with liz<br>we base this on well-being and if it's<br>not about well-being<br>of the planet of the peoples<br>of the planet then i don't know what<br>we're talking about<br>for me it it just doesn't make sense<br>that it can't be<br>about well-being so well-being is this<br>idea of<br>aura modi<br>an essential state<br>of being everything that<br>lives has emoji everything that doesn't<br>live also has a modi<br>if it exists it has a modi<br>what i'm just saying now has a modi<br>and if it catches you then it's a modi<br>aura if you go to sleep<br>good night so<br>in the circular economy<br>a interpretation and interpretation of<br>circular economy is the order of that<br>modi high water<br>ho is another kind of spirit<br>when you are full of hope you're full of<br>energy and you want to get out there and<br>you want to do all sorts of things<br>when you've got no hope you're useless<br>don't come near me i don't want anything<br>to do with<br>somebody who hasn't got home but perhaps<br>i can do something with that through<br>affecting<br>the modi order so that the person who<br>doesn't have home<br>all those things that don't have home<br>can be given<br>in order for these things to<br>again be circular there is this idea of<br>sustainability puma<br>but again it's a sustainability about<br>that well-being it's not just sustaining<br>a covert 19 conclusion<br>maori community responses to covert t<br>covert 19.<br>sorry my fat fingers evidenced the<br>principles of the circular<br>circular economy with well being at its<br>core premised on principles of<br>sustainability<br>in maori responses to covert<br>you will have seen the maori community<br>and each<br>tribe ignite<br>through its whakapapa through its<br>funangatanga<br>through its manakitanga to look after<br>ourselves<br>and it was only after the lockdown that<br>we actually experienced<br>a maori death from covet<br>so in what happened in that instance<br>i am asserting that principles<br>of the circular economy guided<br>maori responses to covert<br>and also guide us in our responses<br>to most all and any challenge<br>the biggest challenge perhaps in most of<br>maori society<br>is<br>funerals death ceremonies<br>and tangihanga at marae<br>are the model in my assertion<br>of best practice when somebody dies<br>the maori world immediately ignites<br>and you will see that people<br>go to the morai they know what they're<br>doing<br>they have an immediate understanding<br>because of their whakapapa<br>and their interrelationships and their<br>circularity<br>in that world of how<br>the well-being of the family<br>of the wider family of the hapu<br>of the ewe is to be cared for<br>a microcosm of what we are asserting<br>with less<br>is part of the macrocosm in the new<br>zealand economy<br>at lockdown the tribal machinery is<br>ignited<br>tikama was suspended<br>there's a willingness to be innovatory<br>to say well hold on that's that won't<br>help us<br>at this time we need to do something<br>different<br>and perhaps that will transform how we<br>behave<br>in these kinds of spaces<br>in these kinds of issues the support<br>mechanisms<br>jumped into place so at our home<br>where my wife and i both of us in our<br>late 60s<br>and our daughter in her 30s we received<br>food packages unasked for<br>which we then shared with our neighbours<br>those were quite embarrassing because we<br>didn't need them<br>we're not needy<br>but there were others in need who could<br>not have survived<br>all of these words that most of you will<br>probably becoming<br>familiar with featured<br>as a core element<br>in this well-being and how to sustain<br>that well-being in our circular economy<br>the tribal boundaries were reasserted<br>definitely<br>closed off the boundaries no<br>covered deaths in te whanauwapanui<br>unfortunately uh honey harawira and<br>ngapui<br>were thwarted in the latest lockdown in<br>terms of trying to close down ngapui<br>that was probably a big ask to make with<br>everything that was happening<br>in their world at that time the<br>whakapapa connections<br>so in terms of transformation i'm<br>suggesting<br>we are suggesting and here we are very<br>dependent on um liz and the other<br>strands<br>in our our aotearoa<br>venture adventure<br>that we can juxtapose matauranga maori<br>what we must be very careful of<br>is that each retains its own<br>ethic that is not marrying one to<br>another<br>so that one becomes a junior partner<br>and suffers from the other and therefore<br>there's a divorce<br>it's about each retaining its own ethic<br>and in mata ranga maori an ethic is with<br>whakapapa<br>and whakapapa joins the past to the<br>present<br>for the future there are ways of<br>so we measure with whakapapa with<br>laying down a tracking<br>of what was and what is<br>and what will be and the importance of<br>data<br>within that which is measured<br>not only in terms of measuring one plus<br>one<br>but also measured in how we approach<br>that<br>careful deliberate<br>exact<br>the past is actually in front of us we<br>see and know the past we don't know<br>our future so the future is behind us<br>not going to turn you back my back on<br>you but that's<br>what i present to you this afternoon<br>would you prefer this have this one<br>well thank you very much to our three<br>presenters we're um we're not quite on<br>time so we're going to keep q a fairly<br>brief<br>but they were wonderful presentations so<br>thank you very much for the insights<br>that you've all provided any questions<br>okay i'll turn straight then to our<br>online audience there's one over there<br>oh i'm sorry did i miss<br>i'm sorry thank you thanks liz<br>have we still got donna online donna<br>you're still there aren't you<br>yep hi donna um i just had a question<br>about the<br>um model that you put up for the project<br>based<br>approach to the framework i guess for<br>public policy going forward and just<br>wondering<br>is there real appetite for that in this<br>current government and if so<br>would that entail some sort of<br>restructure of the current<br>way that the ministries are working<br>um in terms of uh ministerial appetite<br>um i i can't definitively say we have<br>been having conversations around this<br>new approach<br>with some of our ministers but<br>absolutely<br>you know just even like listening to<br>what i was saying in terms of the<br>challenges that it presents<br>um in terms of doing this sort of<br>systemic policy<br>you can't do it and um agencies in<br>isolation you've got to work across<br>but um you know that's we we are having<br>to do that now you know we are<br>uh working together with groups of<br>agencies on different topics<br>so it's i think it's um<br>basically taking some of the uh<br>collaborative approaches that we've been<br>developing over time and certainly<br>through covert we've had to collaborate<br>way more than<br>what we would have otherwise and so<br>taking the learnings from that and the<br>momentum from that<br>importantly um into some of our future<br>policy i think is a real<br>uh a focus for me anyway thank you<br>i also had another question is that okay<br>yeah um<br>not for you donna sorry it was for less<br>and your focus on re-use of waste and<br>for the by-product to actually become an<br>input<br>and it looked like it was a very<br>futuristic or looking into the future<br>project<br>wondering if you guys get involved with<br>any ideas about how to deal with<br>byproduct waste that we currently have<br>like what we're sitting on in matara<br>um with the the waste from the t-wise<br>melter<br>uh i think tom will come in in a moment<br>but i think<br>in in new zealand terms the the sort of<br>low-hanging fruit for the circular<br>economy<br>notion is in is in recycling<br>so um ultimately we would want<br>innovation and endogenous growth and all<br>those other things to be adding value<br>over time but you know some of the big<br>issues are<br>you know tires batteries those sort of<br>things<br>and i think we need some um some<br>evidence from the scientists about how<br>we best store<br>all these new uh so all these old<br>batteries that<br>that evs will end up creating for us<br>when it comes to tires again i think we<br>need some<br>some additional innovation from the<br>science sector<br>as to how we best deal with tires<br>and or you build into the price of tyre<br>when you buy it<br>the recycling and and removal of the<br>tyres<br>at the end of their life so much of the<br>circular economy stuff is about<br>end of life issues as well as um<br>minimizing the amount of new raw<br>materials that are in the production of<br>it<br>so there's a life cycle to the product<br>as well that's part of this<br>so in terms of government behavior we<br>sort of need<br>maybe a set of standards such that you<br>can't<br>you can't be a a recycling depot unless<br>you have certain facilities<br>about leakage into the into the<br>groundwater that you've got um<br>an acceptable fire protection so we<br>don't get you know mountains of tyres<br>burning up<br>so i think there would be some sort of<br>licensing of of that that would be<br>uh important awesome thanks so much<br>great work thanks we've got a<br>if we've got a landfill site that's well<br>constructed<br>that has no chance of leakage they've<br>spent an arm and a leg to make sure that<br>it works really well<br>and they are charging tip fees that<br>fully cover the cost<br>of the landfill and make sure that it<br>will be secure forever<br>it will not be leaching waste and<br>they've put in a fee for monitoring<br>they've got all that right<br>and it still costs less on complete cost<br>recovery to put a tire in that landfill<br>than to spend resource into putting it<br>into something else<br>it sounds to me like you're advocating<br>value destruction and i want to<br>know why you view that otherwise well i<br>think the thing is that you<br>you you mentioned that effectively the<br>cost of tires<br>so what you would need to do would be to<br>i can't hear you i would build into the<br>car if you pay for it at the tip<br>then you've paid for it then you don't<br>so you're saying that i'm advocating<br>value destruction<br>if you are saying that we have to pay up<br>front<br>for some ex from some recycle ski<br>recycling scheme that by definition is<br>going to be more expensive<br>than putting something into a<br>well-managed landfill<br>like i can completely take the case that<br>we have to make really sure that the<br>landfills work well<br>and that we're running cost recovery but<br>if we've got all that set right we've<br>got the prices right there<br>i don't know why you think we need to<br>have some other<br>system set up around tires or anything<br>else<br>i think one of the issues about the<br>circular economy is that there's there's<br>an<br>expectation or there's a<br>an attempt to make sure that those<br>byproducts have got higher value than<br>they currently have<br>in terms of a use value and also i mean<br>you basically got<br>you've got societal problems about<br>landfill<br>um if if you're saying you know how do<br>we get rid of waste we bury it<br>then you know there certainly could be<br>an economic case for that<br>because that's what we currently have<br>but we know that those landfill sites<br>i'm going to leave i'm going to leave<br>this one for later discussion i've got<br>one last question that that tom i'm<br>going to<br>um address to you please if you could<br>give us a response on it and i've<br>just here's my question in your project<br>you're working to quantify<br>some values from the maori world so that<br>they um<br>have more weight in policy making how do<br>we do this<br>i don't know and that's why it's so<br>exciting<br>is that what guides us<br>to those kinds of answers um<br>and i'm i'm exploring<br>shows how we value something<br>and how then do we measure that value<br>um too often from my experience on that<br>i'm not an economist so i don't want to<br>teach grammar to suck eggs<br>but very often from my experience<br>something is valued through its<br>monetizing<br>and i i'm sure that there are other ways<br>of showing how something can be valued<br>and therefore how we measure that value<br>i'm not sure how to do that just yet<br>well we'll all be looking very much<br>forward to updates on on that but thank<br>you very much<br>to uh donna to les and to to tom<br>for your presentations and let's give<br>them a good</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
