here<br>and congratulations on running<br>this conference under difficult<br>circumstances where<br>um it was always going to be a touch and<br>go sort of thing and<br>great vibe as a result of all of that<br>i'd like to talk about<br>i'm half time professor at victoria<br>university but i'd also like to talk<br>about my role as chair of the<br>infrastructure commission<br>which was set up a year and a half ago<br>because new zealand's got a bunch of<br>infrastructure issues<br>and of course when covert came along<br>that contributes to some<br>it changes some and it's also changed<br>the way that we've been thinking about<br>some of these things and i'd like to<br>just test some of that<br>with you we're we're talking about<br>long-lived capital assets with big<br>public use their wires and tunnels and<br>bridges and roads and<br>buildings and all that sort of stuff<br>new zealand does have some particular<br>issues and often problems with<br>infrastructure compared to many<br>countries<br>and in fact if you got a bunch of<br>economists together to design a country<br>rather than sort of leaving it to god's<br>own they wouldn't come up with new<br>zealand<br>they'd want a much more dense country<br>they'd want a country that was flat that<br>was seismically<br>stable that had a controlled border<br>around it<br>that was close to other markets that had<br>a dense population<br>and that had an authority that could<br>control the way that all infrastructure<br>you'll be you'll be talking about<br>singapore for sure<br>and our challenge is that we're a little<br>bit different from that so the shape of<br>new zealand<br>the coastline the water movements<br>um the the seismic instability<br>uh a whole bunch of things make it quite<br>a difficult place to do<br>traditional infrastructure in addition<br>demographically we've got a heap of<br>people in one place called auckland<br>spreading down this way<br>and then a very non-dense population in<br>most of the rest of the country also<br>causing issues around a lot of that<br>given that we're a small number of<br>people in this country<br>we have taken the governance of<br>infrastructure<br>to surprisingly fragmented levels so<br>for example water which in britain<br>is mainly handled through a couple of<br>very large authorities<br>in australia mainly through state<br>authorities<br>we have delegated responsibility to very<br>nearly 80 different<br>local authorities and many of them<br>simply do not have<br>the capacity to meet the their legal<br>requirements in terms of provision of<br>clean<br>water handling of dirty water and<br>handling of runoff water<br>and in addition and related to all of<br>this we have<br>pretty limited construction sector which<br>is involved<br>in building a lot of this infrastructure<br>very often with big projects<br>one finds that there's only one or maybe<br>two<br>head contractors that can credibly<br>actually<br>put in for some of these contracts<br>and that's got its own competition<br>issues it's capacity issues<br>big issues around skills and<br>keeping capacity in there as well and<br>i'd like to talk about that in the<br>context of covert<br>quite definitely then just to make it<br>more difficult we have a very complex<br>consenting<br>process a very time consuming<br>very legalistic very costly and<br>sometimes<br>quite unclear process that is leading to<br>a bunch<br>of problems in in quite a number of<br>of large contracts we think consenting<br>probably costs 20 of the total in some<br>cases a lot more<br>and the really interesting thing is the<br>things that we don't do because they're<br>too hard to consent<br>and sometimes those simply don't appear<br>to make a lot of sense in the case of a<br>very large construction project<br>currently underway<br>large roading project with a very big<br>demand for aggregate<br>just basic metal<br>the there is a big problem in new<br>zealand getting hold of aggregate<br>because<br>local authorities will not consent<br>quarries if they can possibly avoid it<br>in this particular case engineers were<br>excited to discover an<br>outbreak of greywacke not an uncommon<br>feature in new zealand we possibly have<br>more aggregate prohibited population<br>than anybody else anywhere else in the<br>world but<br>the lawyers came and looked at and shook<br>their heads and said that'll be five<br>years to get a consent for that<br>why don't we just truck it down from<br>another region incurring a lot of cost<br>on road<br>repair on environmental emissions and so<br>on<br>so given a number of those issues like<br>that<br>the government set up infrastructure<br>commission to take a high-level approach<br>of all of this<br>and we've rapidly also identified<br>another bunch of issues<br>one of which is maintenance is not sexy<br>although it's implications as speaking<br>as a wellington<br>dweller can be pretty unsexy if you<br>don't do it<br>in addition we are<br>i was going to say arguably but i think<br>i need to say arguably not<br>good at using existing infrastructure in<br>some cases because<br>in some areas we do not do demand<br>management<br>there's there's been estimates of very<br>large infrastructure gaps in new zealand<br>something like maybe 20 billion dollars<br>may need spending over the next couple<br>of years but an infrastructure gap<br>is not really an economic concept<br>because it implies there's no demand<br>response on all of that and if for<br>example<br>you build a new road in a dense area it<br>will fill up with traffic<br>unless you price it appropriately so<br>we're also very interested<br>in getting much better demand management<br>now some areas of infrastructure in new<br>zealand because it's a very mixed system<br>a market delivered or partial market<br>delivered<br>i'm talking about electricity<br>telecommunications things like that<br>some of that works very well some of the<br>other stuff through central and local<br>government works quite well<br>and some we don't believe works<br>particularly well at all for example<br>water supply at the moment well then we<br>had locked down<br>and covered and that threw up a few<br>other things<br>as well so initially we were all very<br>concerned about essential services and<br>that means<br>ports warehouses trucking firms and<br>couriers<br>actually i think that worked pretty well<br>i know there's still<br>some very big backlogs there and some of<br>them are<br>getting a bad state at the minute<br>because of the ports of auckland<br>bottlenecks that we've got but generally<br>speaking<br>you know if there was a shortage of<br>toilet paper it was only because<br>we all stocked up to the year 2023 or<br>something like that<br>and the system actually worked pretty<br>well through that<br>but when we look now at where we are now<br>well quite evidently<br>we've got a huge over investment in<br>certain classes of<br>hotels hospitality and tourism relating<br>to international<br>tourist sector and we don't know but<br>there's a fair chance this is<br>going to be over capacity for some years<br>and when that clears may not<br>be quite the well designed investment<br>that we would want for the new look of<br>tourism that we're expecting to get<br>airports reduced or<br>in some cases abandoned in investment<br>plans<br>some of those were very big and they're<br>now just gone<br>off the market altogether on the other<br>hand of course we've been spending a lot<br>of money on miq<br>on certain hotels on border security on<br>other security related things<br>some of that will have some ongoing<br>implications around track and trace and<br>things like that as well<br>and potentially quite useful there's no<br>business international travel we're all<br>zooming<br>and that has worked a lot better than we<br>might have thought for many things<br>but face-to-face relationships we know<br>economically are<br>important for certain sorts of business<br>requirements and those business<br>relationships gradually<br>atrophy as new people come in<br>they don't know the other people they<br>might be very used to zooming<br>but handshake technologies are still<br>quite important<br>and all of that and in that sense we<br>don't want to be<br>the nice kind hermit kingdom<br>and will need to open up at some stage<br>in the meantime of course we're<br>suffering a lot of this sometimes it's<br>well known sometimes less so<br>are you aware there's 50 apec<br>meetings going on at the moment those<br>would have resulted in a thousand people<br>coming into auckland<br>they're all being done on zoom of course<br>i got invited to chair one next week i<br>said fine happy to do that and they said<br>good we'll see you at midnight because<br>that's when it's all happening<br>now america's cup<br>uh a shadow of what it might have been<br>in terms of arrivals and things like<br>that so<br>definitely a big difference going on<br>there's some things<br>happening that are leading clearly to<br>big behavioral changes at the minute and<br>we just don't know how much of that is<br>going to<br>continue into the future work from home<br>versus work from office<br>very big implications downstream<br>and it's got implications on<br>transport public transport in<br>northern cities is under real stress<br>because people<br>have decided that's not a healthy way to<br>travel<br>that's pushing up private transport it's<br>changing where people are locating and<br>changing where people are working less<br>so in new zealand but we will be seeing<br>some of those trends<br>working out over the next couple of<br>years here<br>online retailing has just sped up the<br>change that was already underway<br>in the face of retail you would not want<br>to be a traditional<br>high street based traditional retailer<br>anymore and you can all see already the<br>number of<br>toulette signs around the streets in<br>traditional<br>retail areas and that's going to<br>continue some of that will be a slow<br>burn because<br>some of these retail establishments are<br>on five to ten year<br>lease periods so this is going to come<br>out over the next couple of years<br>above the street level you've got the<br>office space<br>and already big banks and big accounting<br>firms have talked about how much they're<br>expecting to cut back in terms of<br>requirements<br>for floor space against that of course<br>has been<br>when you want to actually socially<br>distance your staff but overall we think<br>it will lead to an enduring reduction in<br>office space requirements<br>and consequently we think the commercial<br>property sector<br>is marked for a significant but<br>medium-term<br>contraction and that's going to have a<br>number of implications<br>through the economy as well in the<br>meantime people have been at home<br>and we've all been surprised at the<br>amount of<br>time investment emotional energy and so<br>on they're putting into<br>home renovations kitchen renovations<br>off-home office furniture furnishings<br>gardens landscaping a very large amount<br>some of that<br>is funds they might have spent traveling<br>offshore<br>some of it's something a bit different<br>from that i think it's a bit of an<br>emotional response<br>and again we're not sure how long that<br>continues no doubt it's increasing<br>pressure in the housing sector<br>we're hearing about a very um<br>tightly wound can house construction<br>sector<br>that really does not have capacity now<br>and again we're not exactly sure how<br>that's all going to<br>work through in addition it's been a lot<br>of expenditure on personal services<br>so people like i don't know<br>elective dental surgery had no<br>revenue during march last year<br>but they actually reported record years<br>we are spending money on ourselves and a<br>whole bunch of personal services in a<br>way we didn't actually expect to before<br>so then you say well what's the<br>government response on all of this and<br>in particular should the government be<br>spending money<br>now on infrastructure and the answer is<br>it depends what you want from the<br>infrastructure<br>and infrastructure spending has been<br>very<br>important in terms of productivity we<br>know that actually there's an<br>interesting imf report<br>from 2018 on new zealand on new zealand<br>infrastructure with some modeling of the<br>implications<br>of infrastructure quality on new zealand<br>productivity<br>it's very hard to get very clear results<br>on some of that<br>if you look uh the world economic forum<br>a year ago<br>did a report on sort of competitiveness<br>of different countries put new zealand<br>at the<br>the highest in fact number one on macro<br>policy<br>and put us at number 46 on<br>infrastructure policy<br>so adrian's obviously doing a better job<br>than we are<br>but we've got room to improve<br>the way we<br>compare with other countries<br>particularly oecd countries on<br>infrastructure investment is quite<br>interesting and we do have some big<br>things to learn from them<br>we've also got a lot to learn from east<br>asia<br>which is where most of the world's<br>infrastructure investment has been<br>and where i detect a personal<br>disinclination to say we can learn much<br>from<br>china singapore and some of the<br>other quite interesting examples in some<br>of those countries<br>but i think that will change we<br>can look back in history and say well<br>president eisenhower<br>in the 1950s did devote a lot of<br>federal spending and state spending into<br>infrastructure with the big<br>u.s state highway system<br>and now president biden is talking about<br>the same thing in fact infrastructure<br>has become the sexy thing<br>to invest in which is a bit surprising<br>because ultimately a lot of it is<br>aggregate metal and concrete<br>but nevertheless there's some big<br>expectations about it<br>so we<br>definitely think that that is important<br>for the future<br>when we do a survey of infrastructure<br>construction in new zealand we see some<br>very big bottlenecks that are there<br>and some of them are in<br>supplies a lot of con heavy construction<br>sectors say they can't get pipes they<br>can't<br>get a bunch of building materials<br>they've been running down stocks in new<br>zealand now they can't get them in over<br>the ports<br>some of that is a temporary phenomenon<br>but it does drive up prices<br>which in new zealand are pretty high for<br>building materials anyway and that will<br>continue for some time they also<br>complain they can't get in technical<br>skilled people that they need<br>and many of the big projects tunneling<br>big bridging<br>some of the other complex ones do need<br>highly skilled international people<br>we estimate about a quarter of that part<br>of the workforce is<br>imported and they're not coming in at<br>the minute because they can't get miq's<br>spaces but the government knows that and<br>is i'm<br>pretty sure focused on improving that<br>in addition we're in another space at<br>the minute so let's assume we open up to<br>australia at some stage<br>we'll be pretty interested to see do we<br>have a skill flow coming in<br>or do we have a skill flow going out and<br>that of course is part of the<br>long-standing leaky new zealand economy<br>issue that we<br>deal with from time to time what about<br>infrastructure for stimulus<br>well there was i mean that's more like<br>the new deal<br>and and roosevelt in the states in the<br>1930s<br>and we tried it in new zealand i'm not<br>talking about the job subsidies<br>but i'm talking about things like these<br>quotation marks around anything it says<br>shovel ready now<br>also the new zealand upgrade program<br>infrastructure upgrade program which was<br>already underway<br>big amounts of money like probably 15<br>billion dollars went out with<br>all of that in the first part of last<br>year<br>what's the implications of<br>that we think it's been very positive<br>for confidence<br>in the industry and around the industry<br>we closed down construction<br>during covert level four australia<br>didn't and i think in future we probably<br>wouldn't either you can control<br>access and health and safety on big<br>horizontal construction<br>sites but apart from that<br>and it's also encouraged building firms<br>not to lay off people which they tended<br>to do<br>at the drop of a hat in the past and<br>they haven't this time which is now<br>important because the construction<br>sector<br>is very very busy in fact we've got a<br>pipeline<br>of work that we think is out there for<br>the next three to five years<br>it's got 50 billion dollars of projects<br>in it<br>and that's more than new zealand is<br>going to be able to deliver in that time<br>in the meantime when we look at these<br>shovel ready projects<br>almost none of them have started even<br>though they were awarded<br>conditional on being design ready and<br>ready to start within either 6 months or<br>12 months<br>and that really pushes us to another big<br>issue<br>which is that our consenting<br>process is complex slow legalistic<br>expensive and<br>we have huge room for people to object<br>to plans even when they're not<br>actually closely impacted by them<br>i have tried explaining this pro this to<br>some colleagues in singapore<br>where i say maybe a big socially<br>desirable<br>project is going to dislocate that<br>person<br>that person refuses to move<br>so we don't do it and they look and say<br>but i thought you had democracy in new<br>zealand didn't you say it was socially<br>desirable<br>and it's quite hard to argue some of<br>those things but there it is that's what<br>we've got now<br>we do have a review of the resource<br>management act underway at the minute<br>we're hopeful about it but it's not<br>straightforward it's a very complex<br>system and it goes to the heart of<br>something<br>that is at the heart of infrastructure<br>that we're not actually good about in<br>new zealand<br>which is driving very hard trade-offs<br>there<br>are hard trade-offs and doing something<br>here<br>can negatively impact something over<br>here it will<br>but we don't like actually<br>facing up to that so there is a risk<br>with the<br>randison report that on the<br>resource management act next tier of<br>three<br>acts or first of all we get 3x we only<br>had one before<br>secondly that they're saying do no<br>damage<br>to the environment and then you can look<br>at other possibilities that isn't a<br>trade-off<br>that's a red line and that we're<br>giving advice to government about that<br>now you can ask<br>people on the next panel their views<br>about that they'll be different from<br>mine<br>but if we want seriously more<br>infrastructure<br>to get more productivity to improve<br>livelihoods and well-being in new<br>zealand<br>we do have to face some of these things<br>one other thing i'd say<br>um oh we need to be much more clever<br>about demand management<br>about pricing about value capture<br>about creative ways of doing all that<br>we've got the technologies now<br>actually covert has sparked off a bunch<br>of really interesting technologies in<br>terms of say<br>traffic flow pricing and costing that<br>could be much more equitable than in the<br>past and we need to make sure we<br>can make good use of that we follow the<br>infrastructure bodies in australia quite<br>a bit and some of them have been<br>quite successful at doing that let me<br>just finish talking about some of the<br>distributional implications<br>of infrastructure and of the covert<br>shock on top of all of that<br>who pays for infrastructure who paid for<br>the roads out here<br>i don't think you will know and quite<br>reasonably so<br>because it will be a complex combination<br>of taxpayers through central government<br>rate payers through local government<br>some user pays through users<br>some other levies some subsidies<br>and some debt and of course if we're<br>talking here about long-lived assets so<br>you would hope there'd be some debt in<br>there there should be some debt in there<br>but then we've got covert shock coming<br>in over the top and i think that covert<br>is going to prove one of those<br>big shocks with the distributional<br>implications<br>and we already know that it's impacting<br>younger people on education<br>and mobility and career possibilities<br>it's impacting the workforce in the<br>whole bunch of ways that have been<br>written about now and that you can<br>read about particularly those in lower<br>skilled<br>sectors of the economy and particularly<br>female because<br>females are more intensive in the<br>services sector<br>and traditionally we've seen around the<br>world a bunch of<br>manufacturing shocks but this is a<br>services sector shock<br>except in wellington where a lot of<br>females work for government<br>and they're in a way insulated from that<br>sort of particular shock as well<br>and also on older people who've lost<br>mobility and have got health risks and<br>all of this<br>it's across the board but in quite a<br>complex sort of way<br>then we've got this other phenomenon<br>really interesting and i hope some of<br>you are working on it called new zealand<br>returnees<br>who are these people who are flooding in<br>to these miq<br>spaces often at taxpayer subsidised<br>expense<br>often i suspect who are not people who<br>have paid taxes in new zealand or not<br>for<br>quite a long time and will they stay<br>here and add to our talent pool<br>or will they be off at the first<br>opportunity and anyway<br>a certain amount of that has been<br>happening we know so some very<br>interesting distributional questions<br>about that cohort<br>as well in the meantime infrastructure<br>is very long-lived it does have very big<br>intergenerational effects<br>who should you probably thank for the<br>road outside there<br>not yourselves not your parents probably<br>your grandparents<br>these are intergenerational things and<br>we have<br>that that tension coming back<br>on us quite strongly in the context of<br>climate change<br>so we've got the greta turnburgs who are<br>saying you have wrecked our future<br>our future world and the balance sheet<br>in the environment<br>and she may be right i hope she's not<br>but she may be right<br>but on the other hand she's got her<br>swedish education her swedish health<br>support and her swedish social security<br>by virtue<br>of what her parents her grandparents and<br>their great grandparents have done<br>as well through that it's a complex and<br>very interesting<br>area thank you very much i'll stop at<br>you stay there alan and i'll walk around<br>you well thanks very much for those um<br>insights that's coming from a place of<br>great experience uh do we have any<br>questions we'll just go slightly over<br>into the next session<br>um given that we started late any<br>questions from the floor<br>those that do want to ask questions here<br>if you can just wait till the mic gets<br>to you please that would be great<br>interesting thank you so much<br>um i want to talk about water you<br>mentioned at the moment it's<br>split across about 80 different<br>organizations in new zealand<br>running it what is the role of the<br>infrastructure commission other than an<br>advisory capacity<br>to push for change to improve<br>productivity and production of things<br>like fundamental water<br>supply well we're only advisory and only<br>persuasive but we can be quite<br>persuasive<br>at the minute the government is looking<br>at water reform and<br>they have proposals out there plus<br>incentives to local authorities to do<br>work to look at the possibility of<br>aggregation<br>which we think has to happen so you<br>could argue about<br>ownership you could argue about local<br>authority amalgamation<br>those are generally considered bridges<br>too far in the in the short term context<br>in new zealand<br>so we're simply looking at aggregation<br>of assets<br>between smaller local authorities and<br>some of these local authorities<br>have got you know they employ some old<br>guy who's a roading engineer<br>and he's trying to do a bit of water<br>engineering as well<br>and it's we can't meet some of the<br>standards that have been put<br>on there so the government is looking at<br>some<br>scenarios of aggregation and it's<br>quite um it's a bit unclear at the<br>minute just how successful that will be<br>our view is we could aggregate even more<br>probably the<br>smaller number overall<br>for larger entities is probably a good<br>idea we've already<br>heard certain local authorities say<br>we're not drinking their water<br>and there are different forms of<br>aggregation so the wellington<br>water one which in principle sounds<br>quite interesting where the six local<br>authorities have<br>i was going to say join together their<br>assets they haven't joined together<br>their assets they have<br>their own six different business plans<br>and there's even some difference in<br>standard to delivery between them<br>so you've got to harmonize all those<br>sorts of things and we think there is<br>quite a lot of possibility for doing<br>that<br>and water is in a way the hidden asset<br>and liability in new zealand where we<br>think we've got heaps of it<br>we've again probably got more perhaps a<br>population than almost anywhere in the<br>world<br>but we have a huge deficit of water<br>infrastructure because 90 something of<br>our water ends up in the ocean<br>and in singapore zero percent ends up in<br>the ocean<br>they use it all now we could be using a<br>lot more but it does require some quite<br>clever infrastructure<br>thanks alan and a kind of associated<br>question that's come from the online<br>audience<br>how could our political system better<br>incentivize long-term<br>infrastructure investment at a national<br>or local government level<br>yeah i mean i think there's a real<br>interest<br>in doing that and i mean i've you know<br>i've been around before the reserve bank<br>i ran treasury<br>and things have gone up and down over<br>the years<br>um but i detect much less ideological<br>um constriction about what sorts of<br>things might be considered<br>now it's more pragmatic and it's what<br>works in an efficient sort of way<br>and consequently there is well there's<br>ppps public-private partnerships<br>amongst some people they've got a bad<br>name they haven't always delivered well<br>and indeed we've been doing some reports<br>on them as to how to make them work<br>better but there's also prospect for<br>a whole range of other more creative<br>interfaces whereby<br>public sector and private sector share<br>the risks<br>and burdens of all of this there's some<br>huge risks in those big infrastructure<br>projects there always will be both in<br>construction and operation<br>and there's a lot more data around the<br>world about what works and what doesn't<br>work<br>there are some things like there's been<br>a new uh called infrastructure<br>financing and funding act went through<br>parliament that gives local authorities<br>the scope to impose levies on developers<br>and<br>in certain sorts of developments to get<br>better infrastructure out of it<br>actually local authorities have got more<br>powers currently<br>than they seem to be prepared to use in<br>terms of special levies and special<br>possibilities<br>and you'd have to say what is it about<br>local politics that's not actually<br>delivering that<br>a lot of the focus of issues do come<br>down to the local government area around<br>the central government<br>thanks quite an optimistic response<br>there so that's that's great<br>let's turn to a question on something a<br>little bit different but you did touch<br>on it in your speech<br>um business dies without the ability to<br>travel or some business and certainly<br>i've been speaking with some of the<br>audience that are facing this<br>minister of health would keep the<br>borders closed is what the question says<br>is there a role for building a really<br>large managed isolation facility<br>or can we fix ministry of health what's<br>your response in<br>in that area please alan well you and i<br>uh professors at universities and we've<br>seen our<br>international students enrollment go<br>from there to<br>there and it's having a very big<br>financial and<br>other impacts and all of that so i guess<br>we've both got interest<br>in seeing ways of getting students into<br>the country under<br>appropriately managed facilities i'm i'm<br>assuming that the government feels that<br>the political<br>feeling popular feeling in new zealand<br>is we should have 100 protection<br>and that's difficult but i<br>i'm sure we're going to get different<br>border controls in the medium term<br>as a result of all of that i don't know<br>exactly how that's going to work out and<br>my<br>learning through the global financial<br>crisis 12 years ago was<br>that first in the first couple of years<br>you're trying to work out and stay ahead<br>of what on earth is coming down the<br>track at you<br>the next decade you're working out all<br>the economic implications of it<br>it takes a while certainly does are<br>there any last questions from the floor<br>can we go with one more question matt<br>are we allowed to go yep all right one<br>one last question from<br>on um online will the proposed<br>replacement of the rma<br>help or hinder infrastructure<br>development<br>and that depends very much what it looks<br>like we have some concerns about<br>current drafting but we are getting<br>quite<br>a interested response from ministers<br>about<br>why that might not lead to some of the<br>things that are very important for this<br>government like<br>housing construction like renewables<br>investment the climate change<br>commissions report<br>implies that we're going to in the next<br>couple of well next decade we're going<br>to have to start work on 15<br>major new wind generation<br>farms i don't think you can do that<br>under current consenting procedure<br>well thank you very much for that<br>wonderful presentation and your</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
