in particular<br>ngati wairere and ngati haiwa welcome<br>you here to the university of waikato<br>it sits upon this land and especially to<br>the call that's gone out from<br>professor neil quiglia vice chancellor<br>pro vice chancellor<br>matt bolger and also anastra to welcome<br>you here<br>this afternoon just a couple of<br>references<br>i think it's very appropriate that this<br>forum has been held here at the<br>university<br>and also its particular theme<br>alfarenui at the university is called<br>and translated loosely that means the<br>ever-changing world<br>and some of that will be what you talk<br>about over the next two days<br>also our mariah is called te kohinga<br>which is translated as the gathering of<br>diverse<br>understanding and enlightenments and so<br>no doubt with all your experience and<br>knowledges and learnings<br>and be able to talk about and discuss<br>over the next two days<br>will help chart some po some policy for<br>the future<br>foreign<br>we're gathered here in the wonderful<br>gallagher<br>academy for performing arts to<br>have a conversation and hopefully a<br>conversation<br>that leaves us challenged and changes<br>our thinking<br>somewhat because we are living<br>in a very very challenging time<br>i uh last night i put the kids to bed<br>and i<br>re-read a report that<br>came out or a talk that was given by the<br>reserve bank governor adrian orr<br>last year as as many of you did<br>obviously as well<br>and um it was had the excellent title<br>navigating at low altitude monetary<br>policy<br>with very low interest rates and the<br>most striking thing about the report<br>was that on the last page of the pdf i<br>was reading<br>i mentioned very briefly that we'd have<br>to keep a watching brief<br>on the pandemic the talk was given in<br>wellington on march<br>10th nine days later we closed the<br>borders<br>to other than citizens and haven't<br>opened them yet<br>and that's not a critique of the<br>reporter it's authors but just a<br>reflection on that whirlwind of activity<br>that happened<br>almost one year ago and the speed at<br>which decisions<br>were being made that's a phenomenal<br>amount of things that had to be<br>processed in a short time we're now one<br>year on from that<br>and so our job today is to take a<br>broader lens<br>to think more about a wider set of<br>success criteria<br>and really to dive in with a greater<br>deal of rigor and analysis that was<br>possible<br>in those first few days of the pandemic<br>so i welcome you to this conversation i<br>welcome you<br>here those that are in the room and i<br>welcome you<br>the people that were online and watching<br>the live stream<br>particularly thank you to those that<br>graciously uh<br>withdrew being in the room obviously we<br>have to cap numbers to<br>100 all of us in our organizations our<br>businesses our<br>families will have had to adjust our<br>lives in the last two or three days<br>so thank you for bearing with us because<br>of this some of our speakers today will<br>be joining us<br>through the live stream or through the<br>screen it's important please<br>given the nature the conversational and<br>debate focus of this<br>conference please do get the questions<br>going for those in the room<br>we'll have a roaming mic one person will<br>hold the mic<br>to your face to avoid the risk of<br>mingling<br>and for those that are watching on a<br>live stream you can download via the qr<br>code the slider app<br>those questions will come through to us<br>here on the stage and we'll be able to<br>pose those to the speakers<br>so please get the questions going and<br>don't hold back this is intended to be<br>an atmosphere of challenge and debate<br>some very quick housekeeping things for<br>those that it's their first time here<br>bathrooms just out there and to the left<br>we'll have a couple of breaks during the<br>day<br>uh we'll then finish up and for those<br>that are staying<br>we'll have dinner uh arranged as well<br>after a drink and some light<br>refreshments<br>um remember of course it's level two uh<br>it's a very hard thing to break the<br>instinct to shake a hand of an old<br>friend when you see them but we are<br>trying to keep people distanced<br>and um because of that the way that we<br>do dinner etc might be slightly<br>different but just bear with us as we do<br>that<br>so given the challenges that we've got<br>not just the pandemic of course but the<br>fact that even before the pandemic<br>we were dealing with a incredible<br>long-term generational defining crisis<br>around environmental and particularly<br>climate change<br>given we are a small trading nation in a<br>world<br>where nationalism is on the rise given<br>we can't look to the media without<br>seeing the<br>i guess the change in the rising voices<br>with frustration about inequality and<br>equity<br>those things tearing the fabrics of some<br>of our social institutions<br>there is a lot to talk about and amongst<br>all the predictions that we all made and<br>some in this room<br>you know made professionally that turned<br>out to be wrong in the last 12 months<br>i for one did not think 12 months ago<br>that it would be possible for<br>new zealand population to talk any more<br>about house prices than we already did<br>and yet here we are i suspect it might<br>come up<br>so in short there's a lot to discuss<br>there's a lot to debate<br>um we look forward to the questions we<br>look forward to the presentations and<br>thank you to all of those that are going<br>to participate<br>and to get us started i'd like to<br>welcome professor<br>neil quigley the vice chancellor of the<br>university of waikato<br>and also the chair of the board of the<br>i'd like to join with matt and fetu in<br>their welcome of all of you thanks for<br>persevering<br>with us with the conference despite the<br>challenges<br>of level three and level two lockdown<br>and uh thanks particularly to our<br>participants<br>from auckland who are of course uh<br>joining us on the zoom call<br>what i thought i'd do is<br>just provide a quick survey of some of<br>the things that<br>perhaps we all know<br>but there won't be many opportunities to<br>try to put them all<br>just on the table and in 15 minutes<br>as each speaker addresses particular<br>of these of these issues so to<br>to start one of the things i was<br>thinking about and preparing for<br>uh today was how this<br>compares with our experience with the<br>global financial crisis<br>because of course it's easy to look back<br>the<br>12 or so years to our response to the<br>gfc<br>and the challenges and the things that<br>that we learned so one of the things<br>that's most apparent<br>and i think will be particularly<br>important about the difference<br>between the period following the gfc<br>and where we are today is that<br>currently there's considerable strength<br>in household balance sheets than in<br>household income<br>so you know post gfc there was<br>a significant uncertainty about<br>real estate prices there was substantial<br>unemployment which we thought we might<br>get<br>as a result of our covered response last<br>year<br>but which actually has produced a<br>relatively<br>muted level of unemployment in<br>our economy of course in significant<br>part<br>because of the policy response to that<br>at the same time we've had<br>a very strong monetary stimulus<br>response which has pushed interest rates<br>very low<br>and that also means<br>that from the point of view of<br>households<br>looking at their position and if they<br>were making a comparison with how they<br>felt back in 2010 or 11<br>you know the the position in which our<br>households find themselves is that they<br>have the ability to spend<br>right now and what that means is<br>the recovery from<br>lockdown and from the economic<br>disruption<br>has been much more rapid than we might<br>have expected<br>and it's also been much more rapid than<br>following the<br>gfc in fact<br>uh we share with china the um the<br>distinction<br>of having the fastest recovery from<br>economic disruption and lockdown last<br>last year<br>one of the other things about the<br>comparison with the gfc<br>the aftermath of the gsc produced a lot<br>of thinking about<br>monetary policy and the genesis of<br>what we in the last year have been<br>talking about as<br>alternative monetary policy instruments<br>so one of the things that's true is that<br>um<br>as a result of our experience over the<br>past<br>year i don't think that we will think<br>about<br>monetary policy in the same way in the<br>future as we have<br>in the past in particular<br>we will think<br>less about interest rates<br>as the not just primary but in some<br>cases<br>to changes in the economy and<br>and think more not just about fiscal<br>policy<br>but also about the central bank balance<br>sheet<br>and the mechanisms that it provides<br>to provide or remove stimulus<br>we're also in a position by comparison<br>with the<br>gfc where business investment<br>has actually uh bounced back after the<br>lockdown<br>now the the investment that we're seeing<br>of course is<br>as you'd expect given the demand for<br>housing<br>particularly focused in residential<br>construction<br>and while uh non-residential investment<br>is not particularly strong it's<br>certainly come off the weakness that we<br>saw<br>so one of the other differences<br>about where we are now is<br>that we're thinking about inflation in a<br>there is a conversation going on at the<br>moment where people are<br>concerned that inflationary<br>pressure may be just over the horizon<br>again<br>and of course that's something that<br>central banks think about<br>we've had a significant increase in the<br>price of oil<br>and you know in some cases that's been a<br>leading indicator of other inflationary<br>pressure<br>but we also<br>are in a world where uh you know for<br>most of the last<br>decade our issue has been too little<br>inflation<br>not too much and<br>and from a new zealand perspective<br>that's particularly<br>been a combination of tradables<br>inflation that was at times<br>negative and certainly over a<br>significant period<br>fluctuated around zero and relatively<br>well<br>well-contained non-tradable inflation<br>so while it's of course<br>important to be vigilant about inflation<br>you'll have no doubt seen the monetary<br>policy committee's<br>reaction to some of the discussion their<br>sense that they want to wait<br>to see further evidence of inflation<br>repression sort of emerge and of course<br>one of the<br>delicate balances there that needs to be<br>considered is<br>while uh while china the economy is<br>is growing quite strongly now while<br>there's<br>a massive stimulus package being talked<br>about<br>under president biden's government in<br>the us<br>at the same time there are still<br>significant parts of the rest of the<br>global economy<br>where more stimulus is needed not less<br>and and that would be true in a lot of<br>europe<br>as well so we also<br>operate at the moment in a world where<br>there's a great deal of uncertainty i<br>think the current<br>the current lockdown is an indication<br>what that means uh is that of course the<br>investment<br>environment is in many areas a difficult<br>one<br>and what surveys<br>of the business community say is that<br>many people in the business community<br>think<br>there's at the moment too much<br>uncertainty to be<br>committing to significant new<br>investments<br>so one of the elements of uncertainty<br>something that<br>perhaps will come up during the course<br>of the conversations<br>is the way in which our response to<br>covert 19 will<br>will evolve over the next few years<br>so at the moment you know we're treating<br>covert 19 as an emergency<br>and you know we have shut the border<br>except for the miq transition<br>available to new zealand citizens and a<br>but you know that<br>as a strategy while it's<br>served this country well at this point<br>it's going to need to transition to<br>quite a different way of thinking about<br>clovert 19 in the future<br>once a significant part of the<br>population is<br>vaccinated we're going to have to face<br>the question<br>you know are we ready to start to regard<br>covert 19 as being endemic<br>in the same way we think about influenza<br>now<br>and and that i think is a challenge<br>not just from a policy perspective that<br>is how do we get from where we are now<br>to that world where we think of covert<br>19<br>as something like influenza in the<br>future with a large proportion of the<br>population<br>vaccinated it's a policy challenge but<br>it's also a psychological challenge<br>given where so many people in new<br>zealand are at the moment<br>and the way they've uh learned to think<br>about the challenge<br>of covert 19. so i think that's a<br>significant part<br>of the uncertainty that that we face<br>so of course everybody in this room<br>is aware of the<br>historically low interest rates<br>that we're observing and indeed<br>you know the success that<br>the reserve bank has had through its<br>policy<br>in in pushing interest rates down across<br>the curve<br>so in a situation where you know<br>as of this morning<br>the government could raise funding for<br>10 years through a bond<br>and expect to pay about 1.7<br>for that money so that<br>rate of interest is of course<br>well below the rate at which we expect<br>the economy to grow<br>over that period so that says well<br>you know surely um you know pretty much<br>every dollar that we could get our hands<br>on if we could invest it in a basket<br>that was going to produce a yield<br>equivalent to the average growth of the<br>economy over that period<br>we would have to be winning but of<br>course<br>both the starting point for these<br>initiatives matters the starting point<br>in particular being<br>how much spare capacity do we have in<br>the economy at the moment how much<br>inflationary pressure would be created<br>by a very significant<br>impulse of additional government<br>investment<br>in the economy and<br>and the answer is that while there's<br>some spare capacity in the economy<br>certainly less than we had imagined<br>there would be at this time<br>as we were thinking about it a year or<br>nine months ago<br>so the starting point matters but of<br>course also<br>if it was public investment<br>the quality of that investment<br>the ability to focus the investment<br>on things like infrastructure<br>but on really quality choices<br>about about the infrastructure that's<br>going to add the most<br>to our potential economic growth into<br>so matt and his opening<br>remarks mentioned issues like<br>climate change as being important and i<br>i certainly think they are<br>i think the current discussion that<br>we're having<br>about the potential policy response to<br>climate change<br>uh reinforces some of the discussions<br>that we've been pushing out<br>through the reserve bank over the past<br>year or more<br>we think there are really significant<br>implications for<br>business in not just climate change<br>itself<br>but in the policy response to climate<br>change it's very important<br>that we get that right and it's great<br>that we've got some people who are very<br>knowledgeable about that<br>here to to help us with our thinking<br>about that<br>matt also mentioned housing and i won't<br>say too much about that<br>um personally uh<br>what i'm concerned about with housing as<br>i think<br>a lot of people are that if if you drove<br>into hamilton from the north<br>uh along tarapa and into the center of<br>hamilton<br>you would have passed a lot of motels<br>and they would have all<br>almost all had no vacancy signs<br>out on the front and you'd have thought<br>hell is a lot of people coming to this<br>conference that they all<br>have booked up all these motel rooms<br>but actually they're not people who are<br>coming to this conference they're people<br>who don't have anywhere else to live<br>uh and uh the challenge you know that we<br>have as a society<br>and finding a way to deal<br>with this housing shortage you know<br>whatever people<br>who want to live in central auckland<br>want to pay for their houses<br>i'm not so concerned about that but i<br>think the question<br>of how we provide<br>good quality low-income housing<br>for the people who are currently unable<br>to find<br>housing of any sort except to be put in<br>what should be just emergency shelter in<br>motels<br>is really really a pressing issue for us<br>to<br>grapple with so there's<br>there's a great deal to talk about<br>before i finish i'll just give you one<br>i've been thinking about and<br>it's a good illustration i i've come to<br>think of it<br>as a good illustration of what happens<br>uh when you get this economic disruption<br>and you get changes<br>that um you can say well you know<br>there's<br>there's relative um changes and we don't<br>worry too much about those<br>but sometimes the compositional effects<br>may be quite important<br>so this year um<br>tertiary institutions across new zealand<br>are feeling quite good about<br>the the outcomes of their student<br>recruitment efforts because<br>student enrollments are up across the<br>country<br>and in many instances they're up quite a<br>lot<br>like 12 or 15 percent in some cases for<br>new to degree qualification enrollments<br>and similarly large increases<br>in some of the polytechnic programs as<br>well<br>the thing that i've realized is of<br>course that's probably just a measure<br>of the proportion of school leavers<br>who normally would leave new zealand to<br>go traveling<br>when they've finished the schooling and<br>before they come to university but<br>of course at the moment they can't so<br>of course with the border close to<br>international students<br>we'll take all the enrolments we can<br>find but therein<br>is an interesting example um we know<br>that<br>both migration into new zealand and<br>immigration has fallen but there's an<br>interesting<br>compositional effect given the way young<br>new zealanders leave the country<br>so often and now are<br>forced to come and talk to professor<br>oxley and professor gibson about<br>again thank you all for uh being here<br>with us<br>i'm really looking forward uh to the<br>next day we've got a great lineup of<br>speakers and<br>across those many areas um<br>infrastructure investment we've got alan<br>bollard we've got uh adrian orr<br>coming to talk to us we've got ganesh<br>and nana talking to us<br>about productivity so i think a great<br>lineup of speakers a credit to matt and<br>this team for putting it together</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
