a<br>good trip to hamilton<br>uh but unfortunately uh under uh the<br>level two situation that we've uh found<br>ourselves in<br>uh i'm required back here in wellington<br>and<br>uh have to join you in this virtual<br>format uh thanks to the organizers of<br>the conference for the opportunity<br>to have a chat today uh as matt<br>indicated i'll i'll say a few things<br>um in by way of introduction and then<br>very happy to take questions<br>i'm conscious that it's a very informed<br>audience and so<br>much of what i would run through in<br>terms of facts and figures and so on<br>you'll<br>have at your fingertips so what i<br>thought i'd do is essentially talk about<br>um three things firstly um<br>how we got to where we are now at this<br>point in uh<br>covert and and in our response to covert<br>and i do want to just rehearse a little<br>bit about<br>our motivations around what we did do in<br>response to covet and how that's<br>been borne out and some of the economic<br>outcomes of that<br>i then secondly want to talk a little<br>bit about the nature of a recovery and a<br>rebuild<br>and again our thinking around what that<br>should look like<br>and then thirdly just um to touch on<br>what are some of the long-standing<br>challenges of the new zealand economy<br>that either<br>haven't changed or have been brought<br>into sharp relief<br>by the effects of government 19. so i'll<br>try and do that<br>in the next few minutes and i think when<br>when i look at<br>the way in which we responded to covert<br>uh 19 quite clearly<br>uh the cliche that there's no playbook<br>for dealing with a pandemic<br>is absolutely true uh you know this<br>arrived<br>uh on our shores in new zealand just<br>over a year ago<br>and it's been a massive year and one in<br>which we've had to<br>rely on the advice of experts and<br>and ensure that we had a plan and a plan<br>that we stuck to in terms of how to deal<br>with covert<br>but when we thought about what were the<br>the policy responses within that<br>uh that's when you are working a lot of<br>instinct and of principle<br>um when it came to the way we viewed it<br>we very much viewed it through<br>the lens of our well-being approach and<br>as all of you will know<br>that's the approach we've taken to the<br>way we're constructing budgets and the<br>way<br>we're looking to both decide what we<br>spend money on but also how we measure<br>our success<br>looking at a wider range of indicators<br>than perhaps we might have traditionally<br>done<br>that is based in the case of the budget<br>process on the treasury's living<br>standards framework<br>and the four capitals within that<br>framework<br>and our view was that and you've heard<br>this framed<br>via a sound bite which is the concept<br>that<br>the best economic approach to covert 19<br>was always going to be<br>a strong public health approach i still<br>believe that today and i believe that<br>our results have<br>borne that out but what that is in fact<br>really is a manifestation<br>of a well-being approach of looking at a<br>variety of factors within<br>the economy how they intersect with one<br>another<br>and how we can make use of all of the<br>tools in the government's toolbox to be<br>able<br>to support both lives and livelihoods<br>i operated on on some pretty fundamental<br>assumptions and that was one of them<br>and as i say i think the success of that<br>has been borne out in the success of our<br>of our economic recovery because that<br>strong public health response<br>has enabled us to have extended periods<br>of time<br>in which the new zealand economy has<br>operated relatively speaking<br>in a normal way and i note i think it's<br>the oxford university stringency index<br>shows that<br>we've had about the fourth least number<br>of days in some form of lockdown of<br>of countries in the world and that is<br>the strength<br>is that yes our elimination approach<br>requires periods of shutdown when we<br>have<br>uh cases or cases that we can't trace<br>but what the payoff of that is<br>extended periods when the economy is<br>operating as a<br>relative in a relatively uh normal way<br>so that that well-being approach was<br>very important to us<br>underpinning that was also a view that<br>along with going hard and early against<br>the virus<br>we needed to move in a similarly<br>decisive way in terms of the economic<br>support<br>to back up that strong public health<br>approach in order to ensure that our<br>strong stocks of social capital our<br>trust and<br>institutions and each other were being<br>upheld we had to deploy<br>financial capital in to the situation<br>and so that's what drove<br>for example the wage subsidy scheme we<br>operated that scheme differently than<br>similar schemes in other countries<br>we paid it out as a lump sum we paid it<br>out<br>where you could predict your revenue<br>loss rather than having to rely<br>on the tax system which is what the<br>australian government did and i have a<br>strong belief that using that approach<br>which we characterized<br>has been about ensuring cash flow and<br>confidence<br>has again been borne out in the<br>statistics so<br>if we look at the wage subsidy scheme<br>its fundamental driver was to ensure<br>attachment to employment remained to<br>give confidence to those businesses to<br>keep people on<br>and ensure that there weren't<br>precipitous decisions made<br>about laying people off uh that's now<br>seen us in a situation where<br>unemployment has come in<br>significantly lower than what was<br>expected we had predictions<br>upwards of 15 unemployment um we've now<br>ended up at around 4.9<br>i think that will go up and down a<br>little bit over the next few months as<br>one or two industries<br>post summer take another look at<br>themselves in particular tourism<br>but regardless it's a significantly<br>better outcome<br>than had been predicted and i think that<br>approach of<br>ensuring cash flow and confidence going<br>hard and early having<br>other schemes as well as the wage<br>subsidy scheme available<br>such as the small business cash flow<br>loan scheme the targeted packages we had<br>in the tourism sector<br>and so on uh has been absolutely<br>critically important<br>so that's really you know a major point<br>i wanted to make is that we've actually<br>extended our well-being approach out as<br>as a way of dealing with a<br>framework for dealing with uh an<br>unprecedented pandemic<br>that has left us in a relatively strong<br>position when it comes to<br>the economy we obviously saw the big<br>rebound in the september quarter<br>uh gdp up 14 um we were one of only<br>four economies in the world to<br>experience economic<br>activity in the september quarter that<br>was stronger than the same precovered<br>period that's<br>an extraordinary outturn as i said<br>unemployment<br>below 5 really strong performance<br>underpinning all of that from the export<br>sector a little bit of softness in some<br>of the january data on exports but<br>overall an extraordinary ability for<br>that to be upheld<br>and again the government worked<br>alongside that sector and one of i think<br>the<br>unheralded aspects of the response to<br>covert<br>has been our aviation support scheme and<br>this is the scheme that's made sure<br>that we do have uh air freight capacity<br>coming in and out<br>of new zealand uh we did run a risk uh<br>that you know even though we were<br>propping in new zealand up with the<br>support we were giving there<br>that other airlines would conclude that<br>they didn't need to come to new zealand<br>anymore<br>we've provided an assurance that that<br>will happen and paid for it exporters<br>still have to pay<br>for the actual freight that they put on<br>the flight but having<br>that capacity there i think has been<br>really important unfortunately not as<br>easy to do when it comes to sea freight<br>and the disruption<br>in the supply chain there has been a<br>real issue i know for um particularly<br>in borders but but also for some<br>exporters as well<br>so you know we feel we're in a very<br>strong position there<br>and that's been most recently borne out<br>in standard and poor's uh<br>upgrading um our credit ratings um so<br>we're now in triple<br>a um for for local currency that's<br>really good and i think we as a whole<br>country need to reflect on the fact that<br>that the reasoning standard poor's gave<br>is their confidence in the<br>underlying fundamentals of our economy<br>but also<br>in the response that has has come<br>forward uh from covert it's their first<br>uh upgrade around the world uh since the<br>pandemic began in the first<br>for new zealand since 2011 getting us<br>back um to where we were in in 2009<br>uh so that that recovery is good it has<br>been an<br>uh even and i think we obviously all<br>understand that there are<br>sectors in our economy that have have<br>been more effective in particular<br>tourism um<br>events the events sector that goes<br>without international education<br>and so we continue to work with those<br>sectors to be able to provide<br>the support that we need i don't want<br>anyone to gain the<br>impression that i think that we've been<br>perfect here we we haven't<br>we've made mistakes but what we've shown<br>is that we can be adaptable and we can<br>respond when we see those<br>mistakes being made and we've tried to<br>take the approach throughout this of<br>a leased regrets approach that we have<br>to go and put<br>you know money in or take a particular<br>stance on the basis of the facts we have<br>if we get it wrong<br>then we have to move and adapt for that<br>and i think by and large<br>that approach has served us well along<br>with obviously listening to the<br>scientific<br>and expert advice in terms of um<br>so that's a skate across some sort of<br>aspects of of our<br>approach that uh i think we can we can<br>be proud of<br>in terms of where we where we're going<br>in<br>accelerating the economic recovery uh i<br>just want to highlight two or three<br>points here<br>the first of those was a lesson that we<br>learned from the global financial crisis<br>which was that when the time came for<br>our recovery<br>um we had real issues around skills and<br>workforce<br>and we simply didn't have the people<br>that we needed to be able to drive that<br>on<br>so we took a very clear decision as part<br>of the may 2020 budget<br>to put probably the biggest investment<br>that new zealand's ever seen<br>into skills and training and in<br>particular apprenticeships<br>and that has seen a tremendous result<br>the latest numbers i have is that we've<br>seen 125<br>increase in people and apprenticeships<br>since we made them free<br>in the construction industry we've got<br>massively larger number of<br>apprenticeships there<br>and that gives us some confidence that<br>we are meeting many of the labor force<br>needs that<br>are there as we get into recovery we<br>will not be able to meet all of them<br>however<br>um from our domestic workforce and i you<br>know one of the issues we now have to<br>grapple with as a country coming out of<br>covet<br>is what does immigration policy look<br>like in<br>a post-covered era it will continue<br>immigration will continue to be part of<br>the new zealand economic story<br>and we will continue to want to bring<br>people in where we have skill gaps to<br>ensure that we can<br>you know create the high-wage jobs we<br>want and have<br>the right people coming in to fill the<br>right job but<br>the large scale and migration net inward<br>migration that we've seen<br>may not come back quickly because there<br>will be decisions being made by people<br>overseas<br>about where they want to be and how much<br>they want to travel but we also have to<br>look at this as an opportunity to say<br>we're in our economy can we be doing<br>more to train new zealanders to lift the<br>value of the wages<br>in particular sectors and that's<br>certainly something the government is<br>turning its mind to<br>as we speak otherwise in terms of<br>accelerating the recovery obviously<br>there's been a hugely<br>significant investment from the<br>government i make no apologies for that<br>uh if you are saving for a rainy day and<br>successive governments have done that<br>uh then when it starts raining you must<br>put the umbrella up and that's what<br>we've done<br>uh you know the spending that we've<br>we've allocated has gone<br>right across the economy from basic<br>social supports and increasing those all<br>the way through<br>to significant investment in all parts<br>of the productive economy<br>making sure that we're doing the right<br>thing with with around 40 billion<br>dollars worth<br>of infrastructure investment coming<br>through over the next few years<br>everything from housing and transport to<br>trying to get on top of some of the big<br>challenges i'll finish on<br>uh in a moment and so that that heavy<br>investment<br>um is is i believe the right thing to do<br>but obviously it has consequences and<br>i think one of the really important<br>things to remember in thinking about<br>covert<br>is that there are no costless decisions<br>um we could have made decisions to spend<br>less<br>that would have had costs in other parts<br>of our society<br>we could have made decisions to not<br>adopt an elimination strategy<br>that would have had significant impacts<br>in in terms of of health outcomes<br>so all decisions have a cost and there<br>is a significant financial cost to the<br>one we have<br>made what i believe is that our way out<br>from this<br>continues to be to grow the economy<br>productively<br>we've clearly had strong support from<br>monetary policy alongside our fiscal<br>policy<br>strategy but i also accept that as time<br>wears on we need to be returning<br>ourselves to<br>a more balanced fiscal position what i<br>would say is that won't happen<br>quickly and the numbers that we've seen<br>are coming through<br>both the half yearly update and around<br>the time of the budget policy statement<br>earlier this year<br>indicate that new zealanders will see<br>higher levels of government debt than we<br>have in the past<br>but the signs are good for that coming<br>down significantly quicker<br>than what we had in initially both<br>forecasted in<br>and projected so we will still pick up<br>according to the forecasts<br>in the high 40s percent of net core<br>crown debt um<br>of gdp uh but then that starts to come<br>down<br>and by the end of the projection period<br>the 10-year projection period we're back<br>down into the mid-30s<br>to me that is responsible it will still<br>see new zealand sit<br>among the least indebted countries in<br>the world<br>but i'm not prepared to go down the path<br>of austerity that would be required<br>to bring those levels of debt down to<br>that 19 20 percent level<br>um that we saw before uh before covert<br>19.<br>we will get there we will bring<br>ourselves back to<br>a more stable position over time but i'm<br>not prepared to sacrifice the things<br>that we need to do in the economy<br>on the way through there new zealanders<br>in a strong position to borrow and one<br>of the<br>really interesting aspects of the cost<br>of borrowing<br>is that today we even with the<br>extraordinary sums of money<br>that we've borrowed over the last year<br>uh our debt servicing costs are similar<br>to what they were in 2016<br>um when we were borrowing a lot less so<br>the low interest rate environment has<br>been<br>good for us in that way but an important<br>part of acknowledging that we can handle<br>the debt we have and again standard and<br>poor's and others have recognized that<br>and then my final set of comments i<br>wanted to make by way of introduction<br>are about<br>those longer-term challenges in the new<br>zealand economy some of which<br>have been exacerbated by covert 19 and<br>bought into more sharp relief and others<br>of which<br>we simply have to carry on working on<br>when i think about and i know you've<br>already had dinish nana on today when i<br>think about the productivity challenges<br>that new zealand faces those those have<br>been brought into more sharp relief<br>during this period of time it is vitally<br>important for us that we continue<br>to ensure that the industries that have<br>done as well through covet<br>are both supported and moved forward<br>further into the 21st century and<br>there's some really good work that's<br>been done and things like the fit for a<br>better world strategy<br>around sustainable agriculture the<br>industry transformation plans that we've<br>been working on<br>are both in areas like agritech and the<br>one in the digital sector<br>that's underway at the moment and i just<br>think we all recognize it and<br>government has shown to us we need<br>resilience<br>we need diversity of product we need<br>diversity of market<br>and we've got to make sure that those<br>things are front and center we've put<br>significant resources<br>into nzte and elsewhere to help us<br>along their journey the other big issues<br>that are in front of the government at<br>the moment housing we all know well<br>is a very long-term challenge but again<br>um covert 19 has shown<br>uh the difficulties of of working on<br>this sector<br>all economists from the from the retail<br>banks and from<br>the government institutions were<br>predicting drops in house prices<br>quite significant drops in house prices<br>through 2020 the opposite occurred<br>we're now in the process of working<br>through our response to that<br>but it's quite clear that that housing<br>challenge remains massive for us<br>it is a supply and a demand challenge<br>and one that will occupy<br>the time of this government and<br>governments to come for some time<br>in an area like climate change we've got<br>a massive opportunity in my view<br>i actually think climate independent<br>climate commission report is probably<br>one of the most<br>significant documents of my political<br>lifetime and as a government we are very<br>seized of the need to get ahead of that<br>challenge<br>to make sure that we do have the carbon<br>budgets in the areas like<br>transport industrial heat electricity<br>generation<br>that shows that we can genuinely meet<br>those goals but then also sees that<br>opportunity that exists for new zealand<br>to lead in the technological development<br>around climate change<br>and to lead the world in the way that we<br>adapt our industries to be able to be<br>sustainable uh going forward so that<br>is a massive challenge for us as well<br>and then finally in the area of child<br>wellbeing<br>where um again covert 19 is highlighted<br>recessions will always have a<br>disproportionate impact on those<br>who are in lowest income communities and<br>groups that are already marginalized so<br>our focus<br>our evidence-based focus when we put<br>together our<br>objectives for the budget have to be<br>able to address those issues<br>we've made a number of short-term<br>measures through covert to deal with<br>that<br>but the long-term importance of reducing<br>rates of child poverty<br>in our country are critical good signs<br>and the latest numbers that we've seen<br>that the families package<br>we brought in when we first came into<br>government's having some effect but no<br>doubt a long way to go<br>so that just highlights that new zealand<br>economy has a number of existing<br>challenges<br>all of which are on our plate while we<br>continue uh to keep new zealanders safe<br>from covert 19.<br>um those three things keeping new<br>zealand safe from covert 19<br>accelerating our economic recovery and<br>dealing with the big challenges<br>are the priorities that are on our plate<br>this term so with that matt i'll leave<br>my comments and take<br>questions<br>thank you<br>all right a lot uh to discuss and i'm<br>sure that everybody um<br>would have questions for the deputy<br>prime minister that would go for hours<br>um<br>i'll start with um with one that's uh<br>been bubbling away<br>obviously having been very successful in<br>an elimination<br>strategy we're now in a different<br>situation to much of the rest of the<br>world<br>we're looking at vaccine rollouts we're<br>looking at other countries that may have<br>maybe moved through some immunity from<br>from people who have had had the virus<br>and recovered<br>what is your thinking about how we<br>reconnect to the world<br>as other countries may by and large go<br>back to a version of normal people can<br>trade people can gather<br>due to a mix of vaccine vaccination and<br>immunity at a point where we're<br>in elimination land how do we go and<br>transition from that to reconnect and<br>you know<br>i guess stop being such an island as we<br>are now<br>yeah i mean i guess a few thoughts in<br>response to that the first is<br>um i think we need to be careful not to<br>buy into the idea that we've<br>become completely isolated from the<br>world we haven't<br>the thing we're missing is the ability<br>to personally travel<br>but as i mentioned before you know we we<br>have had tremendous<br>um performance from our export sector<br>over this period of time and we've<br>continued to make sure that it happens<br>and that trade will continue and will i<br>hope grow and be enhanced and so<br>i do think it's really important that we<br>don't overdo this fact that there are<br>issues around the border and<br>a very particular sector international<br>tourism<br>that's affected by that and then events<br>and<br>international lead to an extent so i<br>just want to make that as my caveat to<br>the question i think<br>it's easy to draw this in a black and<br>white way that i don't think is is that<br>accurate<br>second point is we're not going to stand<br>still waiting<br>just for the whole population to be<br>vaccinated everyone's well aware<br>of the fact that we're continuing to<br>work on the australian travel bubble<br>work on how we can ensure we can get<br>travel within the pacific<br>to the extent that those nations in the<br>pacific are keen on it<br>and so i think you know that process<br>continues while we work<br>to vaccinate the whole population<br>and then my third point would be you<br>know we have managed to operate the<br>elimination strategy gives us the<br>ability<br>to operate in a very normal way here in<br>new zealand<br>when we are at level one and that<br>strategy i think has served us well<br>as other countries start to to get get<br>themselves in the position to be more<br>like we have been<br>over time um that will only enhance the<br>economic activity in those countries<br>and allow us uh to be able to to sell<br>into those countries<br>and get the benefit of our exports but<br>you know the strategy has served us well<br>the vaccination campaign has begun we'll<br>be in a strong position<br>to vaccinated all new zealanders before<br>the end of this year<br>um it'll be interesting to see where<br>other countries get to on<br>on on that and then their confidence to<br>start moving around the world<br>themselves<br>a question that came through from the<br>audience<br>the cost of covered response has been<br>one of the largest in the oecd<br>in terms of output for gone and<br>increased debt<br>you referenced yourself the fact that<br>there are no costless decisions<br>how how is the government going through<br>that decision-making process<br>how much is too much how much is enough<br>and how are you going through those<br>policy decisions to make those<br>trade-offs<br>yeah and i mean that's the that's the<br>bread and butter of government in normal<br>times anyway is the trade-off of of<br>of what you do there from our<br>perspective you know<br>i i tried to to say this from the<br>beginning that um<br>you know these these funds we've created<br>are envelopes not targets<br>and so we don't have to spend every<br>dollar that's sitting in the envelope<br>and we as everybody knows kept money<br>back within the covert fund<br>for the possibility of resurgences and<br>here we find ourselves<br>today in their position so we're we're<br>carefully judging that<br>the other piece of work that i've been<br>doing which is we've put alongside the<br>budget process is<br>going back over each item of spending<br>within<br>the covert relief fund and assessing<br>whether the money has been spent<br>is it still needed can it be<br>reprioritized and so we're in<br>the midst of that exercise now and i<br>know you've got adrian with you tomorrow<br>morning and<br>and one of the things also to think<br>about with the reserve bank<br>is that while they had the facility um<br>in the large-scale asset<br>purchase program to purchase a hundred<br>billion dollars worth of bonds<br>only about 45 billion i think has<br>actually been purchased so again<br>it's about calibrating the response to<br>where we are<br>i recognize that it's a large response<br>but i<br>again will defend that because i think<br>that when you look at<br>unemployment when you look at the return<br>we've had in terms of gdp<br>we're coming back well but yes in the<br>initial period of time it was a<br>it's a large response but i think it<br>will still believe it was the<br>appropriate one<br>thank you um one a bit nearer to home<br>i'm standing on the the stage of a great<br>facility<br>in a university and a question that came<br>through was<br>acknowledging the the great increase in<br>people going into trade<br>what's your position on significant<br>financial challenges and losses in the<br>university sector<br>international education yeah and as i<br>mentioned a couple of times i<br>absolutely recognize that international<br>education is a signal that's<br>been affected we've tried to keep the<br>window open or the pipeline open with<br>a modest number of students coming back<br>through the system<br>for this academic year i guess my<br>message to the university sector is that<br>this is going to be a challenging year<br>in 2021 but i think<br>2022 is a year that will be<br>that will be very strong for potentially<br>anyway for<br>for that international education sector<br>um<br>universities do have balance sheets uh<br>and they can be looked at<br>and they should be looked at but then i<br>think my second so that's this my second<br>message<br>is is that it is also uh and i<br>hate to trigger peter williams or<br>anything with the use of the word reset<br>but<br>it is an opportunity for uh universities<br>to take a look<br>at the mix of of their funding sources<br>and<br>you know we've just been talking i was<br>talking before and i think other<br>speakers earlier today have talked about<br>the huge importance of diversification<br>and our overall<br>um portfolio the same exists for the<br>universities<br>and you know i in fairness to the<br>university sector they were<br>directed via the previous national<br>government's tertiary education strategy<br>towards a greater reliance on<br>international students i think now we<br>have to start thinking a little bit more<br>about<br>a bit more resilience being built into<br>that there's one tertiary institution in<br>new zealand who took their own decision<br>a couple of years ago<br>to not be quite so reliant and certainly<br>to look at even the mix within<br>international students that they have<br>and i think my view is that that is a<br>very important conversation<br>and then thirdly and i've had this<br>raised by a number of tertiary<br>institutions<br>just a conversation about partnerships<br>with the government around some of the<br>the longer term capital expenses<br>expenditure that's out there<br>we were able to do that with the<br>university of auckland with one part of<br>the<br>infrastructure reference group funding<br>and i recognize that there's<br>some good conversations to have about<br>that but i think my main piece of advice<br>is<br>as a as a business a university needs to<br>have a think about<br>2021 being a challenging year but 2022<br>and beyond looking quite<br>quite good thank you um<br>another one you've you've i guess a lot<br>of things come down to<br>broader issues at the moment questions<br>about migration so<br>there's a point made that international<br>evidence strongly suggests migration<br>is good for for growing the income of<br>locals as<br>well as others what's your view on<br>the right level of migration for new<br>zealand<br>and do you see new zealand being<br>different is there any evidence for new<br>zealand being different in terms of that<br>international evidence of migration<br>generally being<br>wealthy creative there's no doubt that<br>the economic model is<br>treasury and elsewhere will say net the<br>that on a net level<br>um immigration is a positive for the<br>economy<br>the real question for us is is the scale<br>in the mix<br>of that and as i said in my earlier<br>comments<br>what we now want to do is take a look at<br>our immigration settings to make sure<br>that our focus<br>genuinely is on on filling skill gaps<br>in ways in which we lift productivity<br>and<br>credit back to the previous national<br>government and then our term as well<br>we've gone through and made some changes<br>to settings where we weren't quite<br>getting that balance right<br>there was a system where you were able<br>to extend your visa on the basis of your<br>tertiary course for the length of time<br>of your tertiary course which would then<br>open up the ability for you to be here<br>long enough to get residents and so<br>forth and so on<br>and we saw some exploitation of that<br>which as i say both governments have<br>cracked down on we want to continue to<br>look at the settings so we really are<br>getting ourselves in a position where<br>that mix of immigration is about<br>lifting productivity lifting the value<br>of what we do<br>what does that mean for exactly exact<br>numbers in the future that's the piece<br>of work that<br>i think i heard minister farpoi in the<br>media the other day talking about<br>that we now need to do it's a complex<br>picture matt you know right now<br>um we've got a number of working holiday<br>visa holders and others who've stayed in<br>new zealand<br>for a variety of different reasons who<br>are actually quite important to making<br>sure that we<br>manage to do some of the things we need<br>to do over the next few months in the<br>horticulture sector and elsewhere<br>and so you know it's it's never a it's<br>never<br>as clean and clear-cut as you might like<br>it to be the regional seasonal<br>employer program with people coming in<br>from the pacific very important to<br>pacific economies as well as our own<br>so we're trying to get the balance of<br>that right so immigration i wish was<br>a clear-cut thing where you could say<br>this number over this time<br>but i think what we've got to do is just<br>make sure we go back and get the<br>settings right<br>and then my final point would be the one<br>again i made before which is that<br>we also know that alongside that<br>important role immigration pays in our<br>productive economy<br>it's also been used in some sectors to<br>suppress wages<br>and we want to be able to work through<br>that lift the wages in those sectors<br>have more new zealanders going into that<br>that's a transitional situation in many<br>of those industries<br>but it's one that we do need to work<br>through<br>all right i'll just check if there's a<br>last question from the floor<br>in the room here in the gallery academy<br>no all right we'll um look we'll wrap up<br>again deputy prime minister thank you<br>very much um we we are imagining what<br>else is on your schedule today and it's<br>dealing with the<br>the questions you've just been asked<br>here so we genuinely appreciate you<br>taking the time to to join us hopefully<br>next time in person<br>and good luck thank you cheers thanks</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
