is<br>remotely<br>uh i um<br>nearly got used to this technology but<br>we have to start all over again given it<br>was a few months from<br>for me when we were back in um<br>in the real world and now back to online<br>so i'll just check if i can<br>share my screen with a bit of luck and<br>um with a bit of luck that should come<br>through uh for you<br>to all see my slides um and i suppose<br>um yeah starting from scratch uh<br>my name's ganesh uh<br>i'm a first-generation new zealander<br>born and bred<br>here in wellington um i acknowledge<br>maori as tangata fino about and<br>acknowledge your tupana mai tupana and<br>our tupana who have<br>traveled to these lands and done a lot<br>of hard mahi and<br>left us quite a lot for us to look after<br>and indeed pass on to future generations<br>and uh<br>i um and actually em actually should say<br>i'm humbled<br>to not just be here but to be in a part<br>of the world where we can<br>um enjoy the fruits of our<br>endeavor and indeed be in a part to be<br>all in all honesty to be in a part of<br>the world where many many many<br>others in the world would give their<br>left and right arms for and i think<br>that's a<br>uh a a tale that i i'll be honest i<br>don't think<br>i think there are some i'm not sure many<br>but there are some new zealanders<br>who unfortunately don't realize just how<br>in the jargon i suppose it's a bit<br>flippant but just how lucky we are<br>over the last 12 months having been here<br>and in terms of<br>um a little bit of luck obviously in<br>terms of being far away from the rest of<br>the world and being a little bit of an<br>island and it's sort of easy to<br>lock down but even despite all of that<br>even with those advantages<br>a lot of challenges and um it's a credit<br>to us<br>as a community and as a nation to have<br>got through<br>um covered reasonably unblemished<br>um and that's not<br>underplaying the um many many<br>individuals and families and whanau and<br>businesses<br>who have done it hard for the rest of us<br>and doing it tough and again are doing<br>it tough<br>given the lockdown again but i'm sure<br>with<br>um all the opportunities that we've got<br>in front of us and indeed all the<br>benefits we've got in this part of the<br>world we will<br>definitely make it through even further<br>now my role now and it's a little bit<br>new but i'm going to be a month on<br>into being chair of the productivity<br>commission and it's a<br>it's a new challenge for me and i pick<br>it up with both hands and it's an<br>exciting challenge and uh<br>with you and many other organizations<br>and people across altera i look forward<br>to<br>not just improving productivity in a<br>post-covered world but to make<br>the most of all of the challenges and<br>the opportunities that are in front of<br>us<br>um and i suppose if i just push forward<br>to the first slide if i<br>can uh where are we the technology there<br>we go<br>uh just uh telling you stuff that you<br>probably don't<br>you probably know already and don't need<br>telling i think the important thing<br>uh we're independent crown entity um we<br>are not a government uh ministry or<br>department and we do act independently<br>and our critical purpose which i take um<br>from the legislation that set us up 10<br>years ago um i think's<br>summarizes uh my ko papa very well and<br>this is one of the reasons i did<br>um accept this challenge here despite um<br>wanting to stay in my comfort zone at 20<br>years at bill and looking forward to<br>retirement<br>um as for most things in life when<br>challenges or<br>opportunities come in front of you you<br>pick them up<br>the purpose there to provide advice to<br>government on improving productivity<br>and in my opinion most importantly is to<br>read beyond that in that clause<br>to improve productivity in a way that is<br>directed to support<br>to supporting the overall well-being of<br>new zealanders<br>having regard to a wide variety of<br>communities of interest and population<br>groups<br>in new zealand society and<br>whatever i say today i should put this<br>out bluntly and openly despite<br>some of my initial comments and thoughts<br>being misinterpreted by some<br>i think mischievously by some as well<br>anything i say is in is in no way<br>critical of what the productivity<br>commission has done over the past 10<br>years<br>i believe they have picked up their<br>purpose uh<br>well and have done amazing pieces of<br>research and inquiries and contributed<br>to the policy effort and<br>inquiry and evidence and knowledge base<br>that uh that we need here in new zealand<br>uh<br>having said that um i knew i'm different<br>to the previous chair and i'll be<br>cast a different eye as to the previous<br>uh commissioners<br>i make no apologies for that maybe<br>different emphasis<br>i make no apologies for that um but<br>uh in defense of taking a new<br>perspective or even just a slightly<br>different perspective<br>um it is a new world and it's a cliche<br>but i think that uh<br>new zealanders have got to realize that<br>that business as usual model<br>that some of us yearn for you know just<br>let's open the borders and let's go back<br>to normal like it was in 2019<br>is not going to happen immediately<br>it's probably not going to happen in the<br>short term and to be honest it's<br>probably not going to happen for quite a<br>long time if ever because there are lots<br>of other challenges that were<br>even before we close the borders that<br>are becoming<br>uh even more and more pressing and so<br>that<br>point about supporting overall<br>well-being is critical<br>and the point about the variety of<br>communities of interest<br>in population groups that we have here<br>in aotearoa<br>is also critical yes<br>improved productivity but not that is<br>not the end<br>that is the means to the end in the end<br>is the overall well-being of<br>all new zealanders and we have to look<br>at<br>productivity in a way to make sure that<br>it does contribute to well-being<br>not just of new zealanders but dare i<br>say of all new zealanders<br>and i suppose my thinking about<br>productivity i've done obviously a lot<br>of thinking about it as have<br>many many others uh and um<br>40 odd years ago when i first learned<br>stage one economics classes down here in<br>victoria university<br>sitting in front of whiteboards and um<br>learned professors and lecturers<br>i learned all about productivity being<br>the residual from<br>labor and capital inputs and what was<br>left over in terms of growth that we<br>couldn't<br>subscribe or ascribe to increases in<br>labor or increases in capital<br>we thought of as productivity and so yes<br>i know all about<br>inputs and outputs and to be honest<br>i still hold that as my definition of<br>productivity<br>but it's just broader because we haven't<br>got two sets of inputs now<br>um we have to openly acknowledge that<br>there's more than just capital and labor<br>or human capital as<br>some people call it we do know that<br>natural capital is important it is one<br>of our<br>reset of resources that we've got to use<br>as inputs<br>into our production process but also<br>this thing that um treasury is called<br>social capital which is the<br>in those four sets of resources on the<br>slide which together make up<br>an element of the living standards<br>framework and while i'm not a<br>i wouldn't say i'm a huge fan of the<br>living standards framework i do applaud<br>treasury<br>in terms of building this framework to<br>give us a<br>a a perspective on how we can think<br>not just in terms of productivity but<br>how we can think in terms of<br>our economic system and how it delivers<br>well-being<br>the four sets of resources it really<br>isn't that difficult<br>for us as economists to think about it<br>um<br>economists call them resources<br>accountants call them capitals<br>i call them taonga or treasures because<br>i like that frame<br>some people don't like the word capital<br>some people don't like the word<br>inputs it depends on the audience you're<br>talking to<br>and if you don't like any of those words<br>i like the word assets<br>um because they should appear on our<br>balance sheet<br>as a nation and indeed they probably<br>should appear on each and end of<br>each of your individual balance sheets<br>whether you're a business organization<br>or a not-for-profit<br>or a community group you all have<br>balance sheets<br>you all have assets on them and it's<br>those assets<br>how you we use those assets how we apply<br>those assets<br>how we get the best out of those assets<br>all those resources<br>all our tolna that then determine our<br>overall well-being<br>and that's productivity how we use each<br>of those four resources<br>or those four sets of resources um<br>and we can talk about the definitions of<br>each of those and i will in a bit<br>i think that social a bit of a i suppose<br>um a peek into later on in my talk that<br>social capital element<br>is i think something that um we need to<br>look into quite deeply<br>in terms of just how important it is in<br>our<br>drive for productivity and for<br>well-being<br>um it's no news to any of us in this<br>room or it shouldn't be<br>our productivity performance over the<br>last<br>couple of decades at least and uh<br>probably a bit longer<br>obviously the data is a bit difficult to<br>match up but this is the data that's the<br>consistent set of<br>series from statistics new zealand gives<br>us a<br>picture of a quite um i suppose sobering<br>performance in terms of productivity<br>improvements it's slowing i suppose we<br>can say it's still above the<br>above the axes in terms of above zero<br>but that's really not<br>um much um comfort for people like me<br>who actually do want to<br>get some well-being out there to those<br>who have missed out<br>and in in a nutshell um<br>the less we do on this particular graph<br>the much harder it is<br>for us to not just look after those<br>assets that we've been given<br>from our past generations but to not to<br>improve those assets<br>and to deliver well-being out of them so<br>it's<br>it's a tough ask but we've actually got<br>to start taking productivity seriously<br>we've got to start understanding<br>productivity<br>properly as well the i suppose the<br>the interesting or the opportunity point<br>that we've got<br>is that covert does provide us with a<br>bit of a reset opportunity<br>um and a bit of a<br>challenge for all of us if we needed it<br>all<br>to actually and question ourselves about<br>whether we actually do want to go back<br>to business as usual<br>just what was so great about business as<br>usual that we want to go back to<br>and to be honest look at that graph<br>that's in front of you<br>that was not a great performance and<br>that was long before covert<br>and out of that performance obviously<br>there has been well-being implications<br>for many in our communities<br>the overall impact of covert and this is<br>very short-term<br>um not as bad as it was not as bad as we<br>originally feared and i think that's a<br>credit to many<br>businesses and workers here in aotearoa<br>who have done<br>the hard yards and taken a lot of hits<br>on the chin<br>um to make sure that the rest of us can<br>get through<br>but there are some long-standing<br>challenges that we all know about<br>also though out of the covert experience<br>it's highlighted some of that<br>i suppose some of the strengths that we<br>do know and one of those is<br>um again a bit of a indicator of the<br>future<br>is that strength in our communities in<br>our sense of<br>social inclusion and that sense of<br>social capital<br>that i will just hint at for the moment<br>some of the challenges<br>that have been here for a while that i<br>think we ignore at our peril and we<br>really have got to get serious about<br>this<br>if we're talking about human capital or<br>dare i say social capital<br>we've got some large skill gaps across<br>our ethnic groups and and<br>this um is a um<br>not just a challenge it's an indictment<br>of our efforts over the past<br>couple of generations it's an indictment<br>of all of our collective efforts<br>and we've all got to own up for own up<br>to this uh<br>we haven't done well in terms of<br>bringing<br>our communities together in in providing<br>them with the skill base<br>to engage in the modern economy the<br>pictures there<br>in terms of a third or more of our maori<br>and pacifica communities<br>in the low achievers in terms of math<br>science and reading<br>and i suppose my concern<br>shared by many we know what happens with<br>lockdowns and in terms of school<br>closures<br>the concern is these disparities get<br>worse<br>and these disparities will not just hit<br>the maori and pacifica communities they<br>will hit the well-being of all of us<br>because it is those resources that<br>enable<br>our productivity to improve and to<br>enable the delivery of well-being<br>the other i suppose telling you again<br>what you've probably<br>known know already and has been<br>communicated well by others<br>in terms of income and in terms of labor<br>market participation<br>in terms of unemployment rates uh maori<br>and pacifica<br>again being the wrong end of the queue<br>in terms of unemploy in terms of those<br>unemployment statistics<br>those are some of the challenges you<br>could argue those challenges<br>have been here for a long time those<br>unemployment rates have been<br>above uh the rates for other people in<br>the community for quite a while even<br>before covert<br>the problem of course with covetous that<br>going the wrong way<br>um some of the opportunities um<br>our distance has helped but of course<br>um once you close the borders it does<br>make life<br>a lot more difficult for uh many<br>uh sectors in particular tourism and<br>education that<br>do rely on open borders uh<br>we have got lots to think about here in<br>aotearoa about<br>what do we do with our tourism industry<br>and indeed what we do with our<br>international education industry<br>again are we serious about having a<br>conversation about whether business as<br>usual is what we want to go back to<br>or are we serious about having a<br>conversation about<br>reorienting these industries towards<br>something<br>towards an industries and sectors that<br>will deliver<br>high productivity growth and deliver<br>good well-being across our communities<br>and again that goes back to how do we<br>use our resources<br>do we want to make sure that those<br>sectors use our<br>human capital resource our natural<br>capital and our social capital resources<br>our timer<br>uh properly not just properly but<br>maintain them look after them<br>and to deliver well-being um<br>whoops going backwards sorry one slide<br>too many<br>on the on the natural capital a few<br>there was a little bit of plus in terms<br>of what when we did lock down lots of<br>stuff happened i know<br>i enjoyed um very very good<br>environment here in wellington in terms<br>of doing my training runs down the<br>middle of the road<br>around the bays with no cars around and<br>the birds were out and you could listen<br>to them<br>and it was a dare i say a nice time<br>that was a brief interlude in the way we<br>run our lives<br>but we've actually got to be serious<br>about our carbon intensive economy and<br>we've had some uh recommendations and uh<br>policy recommendations come out quite<br>recently and i'll come to them in a<br>second as well<br>uh i think the big plus that has come<br>out of our covert experience and i<br>i don't think i can overstate this and<br>some people may say i'm overreading it<br>but one of the big reasons we've got<br>through<br>um the covert 19 experience even up till<br>now<br>even despite the i suppose a couple of<br>glitches we've had in the last couple of<br>weeks<br>is our sense of community as our sense<br>of inclusion and<br>our sense of um being part of a team and<br>i know some people cringe at the team of<br>5 million or whatever you want to call<br>but that sense of cohesiveness<br>is actually a very very<br>huge asset that i think we underplay<br>here in new zealand um<br>it is an asset that i think we can look<br>to using even better<br>in pla in times when we're not faced<br>with a crisis we have a habit of coming<br>together as a team<br>when there's a crisis but how do we then<br>take those advantages and make them work<br>for us<br>when we're not in a crisis situation i<br>think that's one of the challenges that<br>i put in front of me<br>and i'll talk to that in a second a few<br>more a few more minutes and then we'll<br>open it up for questions in terms of<br>opportunities<br>again going down those four capitals or<br>those four assets route<br>um and it is that balance sheet if your<br>business person if you're an economist<br>it's the assets it's the resources we've<br>got to play with<br>how do we make those resources go better<br>the problem and it's been alluded to<br>already the covert uncertainty will<br>discourage and i don't say they will<br>discourage investment<br>uh probably over the short term and<br>definitely from the private sector and<br>that's understandable despite the<br>interest rates<br>um that we can get uh um that we can get<br>funds for<br>and i think undoubtedly there's a<br>there's a clear role for<br>government for the public sector to play<br>to make sure that<br>our investment program does not um<br>stumble on and they're the flip side of<br>that of course and i do take on<br>take the point that there is a capacity<br>constraint in terms of some of our<br>construction sector<br>that um we need to get around and i<br>think that's<br>again a challenge but we do need to make<br>sure that an infrastructure program<br>continues<br>we need to make sure that our existing<br>assets are used better um<br>transport congestion charging is a<br>boring economist we do go to prices to<br>chan change behavior<br>we do need to change our behavior in<br>terms of the way we use transport<br>the way we use our transport<br>infrastructure and the other element<br>undoubtedly is the three more<br>three waters discussion that we've got<br>to have<br>as a boring economist yes we go to<br>prices uh to change behavior<br>having said that we've got to make sure<br>that those who<br>whose behavior we are trying to change<br>are<br>the groups in the population who can<br>change their behavior<br>as opposed to those who will be forced<br>to<br>uh and these across questions and<br>conversations to have around just<br>transition<br>in that in that conversation<br>the other element that i'd throw in is<br>the way we use<br>our cities um implication we've all<br>got used to working remote and it's not<br>probably not as<br>prevalent here as the changes that<br>happened in other parts of the world<br>but maybe thinking just a little bit<br>further into the future<br>what does that mean in terms of cbd's in<br>regional new zealand<br>if we have a world where we don't all<br>have to<br>get in a car and go to a cbd and sit in<br>an office for eight hours a day<br>or dare i say have high streets that<br>have<br>retail shops on them all the time what<br>does that mean for the way we design<br>cities into the future<br>and i've missed the point around and i<br>will come back to it i'll miss the point<br>advisedly i will come back to it<br>is the focused innovation policy which<br>will be<br>one of the recommendations i hope i'm<br>not speaking out of turn<br>it's in the draft report in terms of our<br>frontier firms and the productivity<br>commission's frontier firms inquiry the<br>draft report was released<br>uh in late december um one of the<br>recommendations about a focused<br>innovation policy about our r and d<br>effort uh here in aotearoa all of the<br>different pieces of the jigsaw puzzle<br>that together<br>make up an innovation ecosystem<br>that we need to figure out to make sure<br>it goes better than it has been<br>we've got a a sense of a i won't say<br>disjointed that's probably going a<br>little bit too far but we have got a<br>sense of<br>uh not focus and not an ecosystem that<br>doesn't function well<br>and we do need to spend a bit of time<br>developing an innovation policy that<br>will support our<br>frontier firms to not just grow but to<br>grow well that will then<br>uh ensure that those other firms that us<br>not quite at the front here<br>we'll get to that front here and that<br>will then enable us to deliver the<br>well-being<br>in terms of high-wage sectors high-wage<br>jobs<br>and high-income communities<br>in terms of human capital linked so that<br>i think linked to that r d<br>but also linked to more broad skills<br>training<br>we need to as i've signaled earlier we<br>need to urgently tackle those<br>achievement gaps<br>that are quite glaring for some in our<br>community<br>and we've had um some<br>uh sorry no i won't go down that track<br>i'll i'll i've<br>run i've not quite run out of time but<br>i'll just push forward and<br>open up for conversation in a second<br>natural capital as i<br>signaled earlier climate change um the<br>climate change commission<br>report and indeed the productivity<br>commission to report from the inquiry i<br>think was a couple of years ago on the<br>low emissions<br>economy those recommendations um<br>i don't think conveniently i think um<br>obviously i do do signal very similar<br>policy requirements and and i think it's<br>um it's past time us putting out<br>policy papers it is now's the time to<br>send<br>clear and consistent signals uh<br>from the policy shops that we do have to<br>change our behavior<br>in terms of whether it be the way we<br>price<br>our nutrients or whether we're the way<br>we price<br>transport or whether we change our<br>behavior in terms of the transport<br>opportunities<br>the time for discussion is probably<br>the best thing that could be that could<br>happen i think from here on<br>is for that clear and consistent policy<br>and economic signals<br>so business and indeed households can<br>make those behavior changes that we've<br>put off for too long<br>and that is a i dare i say a critical<br>opportunity<br>and then i go to the last one which is<br>social capital<br>we have to acknowledge that<br>it's not just growth that we want here<br>it's not just productivity that want<br>here not just growth for growth's sake<br>it's not just productivity improvements<br>for productivity improvements sake<br>those two together deliver us well-being<br>and we need to make sure that they<br>deliver well-being<br>to all not just a select few<br>because the last year has shown us that<br>there are many<br>in our community that are prepared to do<br>it tough and i think<br>we some of us in privileged positions<br>need to<br>i suppose um have that communication<br>back the other way<br>um make sure that we are communicating<br>with those<br>with groups that haven't been included<br>in the past<br>to make sure that they are part of the<br>team they feel part of the team<br>because if they become part of the team<br>not just social capital but human<br>capital and our physical capital indeed<br>our natural capital<br>all of our resources will work together<br>to deliver us that well-being<br>and with that well-being will deliver us<br>productivity growth and vice versa<br>if that's too broad for some um i make<br>no apologies<br>we've tried we've done a hard yards in<br>terms of 40 odd years ago and it was all<br>about<br>delivering machines and people with lots<br>of skills<br>the economy is way more sophisticated<br>now we've got<br>a lot more competitive environment now<br>in terms of<br>having to keep our skills here um<br>we've got a lot more dare i say we're<br>open to a lot more shocks<br>from other parts of the world and indeed<br>internally<br>that means some of our communities and<br>some of our people<br>and our businesses i include businesses<br>in our communities<br>some of our businesses some of our<br>communities are doing it tough<br>we'll continue to do it tough as shocks<br>continue to hit<br>our economy and i hesitate to say the<br>pandemic is not<br>this won't be the last i don't want to<br>be the<br>all doom and gloom but we have to have a<br>system that is resilient<br>to the shocks that are going to continue<br>to hit us and part of that resilience<br>is to include workers and businesses in<br>some form of income smoothing<br>and i suppose throughout it all the one<br>element of our i suppose our<br>living standards framework that i do<br>pack up quite strongly is<br>a pathway to well-being that i<br>like very much it's got uh<br>human capital physical capital social<br>capital and natural capital all around<br>it's got kaitiaki which is our<br>guardianship of our<br>resources manakitanga which is<br>reciprocity<br>not only do we want and need workers um<br>to deliver productivity growth uh we<br>need to go back the other way we need to<br>ensure that those workers are looked<br>after and supported<br>as well and we do want<br>we do want prosperity and we definitely<br>do want productivity<br>my core role um you'll have me as the<br>flag bearer<br>of promoting public understanding of<br>productivity<br>and productivity related matters i'll<br>make no apologies for that<br>we definitely do need champions but we<br>don't just need champions in the<br>business community we need it in the<br>in the broader community we need to<br>bring in<br>those communities and workers and groups<br>that<br>are immediately turned off by the word<br>productivity<br>we need to bring them inside the tent<br>make them or<br>engage with them to ensure they<br>understand that they<br>have got a huge lot to benefit once we<br>lift productivity<br>and turn it into well-being i'll leave<br>that with you<br>i'm sure there's a i've left hopefully a<br>bit of time for a bit of chat<br>and hopefully i've got you thinking<br>and hopefully you can make me think even<br>thank you ganesh all right<br>we we have a microphone in the room<br>and i think i might check first we've<br>actually got a lot of questions coming<br>through<br>getting messages from the team online<br>but i'll just check is there anybody in<br>the room who wanted to start us off<br>before we go no so we'll go to one of<br>them<br>from the from online ganesh so<br>interesting question here from brett<br>o'reilly<br>do you support the views of the late<br>paul callaghan that we needed to reset<br>the economy away from agriculture and<br>tourism<br>as a way of improving our productivity<br>um i<br>i reorient it's probably<br>sorry i'm getting feedback oh hopefully<br>i can talk through this and you're not<br>um<br>you're being able to hear me but um no<br>that's better<br>i wouldn't say away from agriculture and<br>tourism i would say we definitely do<br>need to think about different business<br>models for both of those sectors<br>uh and i do know that agriculture has<br>gone a long way down that track already<br>i'm definitely not in the school of<br>thought that that agriculture has to do<br>all of the adjustment if you're talking<br>about climate change and water<br>there's me and sitting in my um<br>comfortable uh place in the middle of<br>urban wellington has definitely got to<br>think about having to jump in a car<br>every day<br>so we've all got adjustments to make<br>i think that where i probably share um<br>the thoughts of paul callahan<br>is around an economy that's built on<br>knowledge an economy that's built on<br>innovation and so i have no no qualms<br>about that<br>i would add that the agriculture sector<br>has been the source<br>has been one of the sources of huge<br>productivity growth in new zealand<br>across history<br>of across well at least the history of<br>the last hundred years or so<br>in terms of new zealand uh in terms of<br>innovation and productivity growth<br>and i suppose application of that<br>innovation<br>so i'm i i'm not sure i'd<br>talk to i wouldn't think that we need to<br>turn too much away from agriculture<br>but we do have to think about that<br>business model and uh<br>tourism we've got some serious<br>serious challenges here and we've got to<br>have a serious discussion about what we<br>want to do with tourism<br>that that business model that we had um<br>12 months ago<br>we always knew was not sustainable i<br>think we got as much as we could out of<br>it<br>and covered as i supposed accelerated<br>the<br>accelerated the adjustment that was<br>going to have to happen anyway<br>thank you maybe building on that you<br>made comments<br>early in your talk about the the border<br>opening maybe never going back to<br>what we had 12 months ago so an<br>extension of that a question that came<br>through<br>was does the commission have a view<br>about the extent<br>and speed of border opening and maybe<br>just expanding<br>what you said earlier if we're not going<br>back to that how does<br>how does an island nation with less<br>access to the world fit with<br>with growth and productivity um well the<br>commission has no view<br>on whether we should open the borders or<br>not and that's not me sitting on the<br>fence it's not<br>a conversation for me to have i have no<br>expertise in<br>epidemics and and vaccines and all of<br>that sort of stuff<br>obviously we'd like the border i think<br>everybody in new zealand would like the<br>border opened as soon as possible but<br>i'll leave that to for others more<br>learned than me to decide on<br>um but yes how do what is the future for<br>new zealand given a scenario where<br>even when the borders are open let's<br>think about this even when the borders<br>are open<br>the world is going to be different the<br>appetite for<br>many people in other parts of the world<br>to get on a plane and travel<br>for 24 hours to come to here is not<br>going to be as great as it was<br>say 12 months ago so there's going to be<br>that question about<br>whether people are going to want to come<br>here there's going to be the appetite<br>about with and<br>and add on top of that whether you want<br>you know you call it flight shame or not<br>about whether people<br>in terms of climate change are going<br>that appetite for long-term<br>pla plans uh travel<br>so even if the borders are open we've<br>got to have a conversation about<br>the businesses and the industries that<br>rely on<br>um people traveling across borders and<br>then what sort of people so it's not<br>just the internet it's not just a<br>tourist i think the other element<br>is our access to skills uh and we've<br>we've relied on uh a global labor market<br>in new zealand to to get the to<br>hopefully get some of the cream of the<br>crop here<br>because we know that new zealanders<br>travel abroad and so there's a little<br>bit of replacement there and a little<br>bit of addition<br>in terms of uh the productivity<br>challenges for new zealand<br>um i think we've<br>we here we don't have control over what<br>happens in the rest of the world so we<br>actually got to think about<br>we actually probably don't have that<br>much control over when we can open the<br>borders or not<br>so and that's not new for new zealand we<br>actually don't have that much control<br>about what happens in the rest of the<br>world's markets you know we don't have<br>that much control over the price we have<br>to pay for oil or whatever it might be<br>so it's just an and i don't want to be<br>flipping but it is another constraint<br>harness<br>that i think we ignore it our prayer or<br>we shouldn't pretend that it's going to<br>go away<br>we have to be honest and open<br>about it and then let's start talking<br>about what's the new business model<br>about where do we access the new skills<br>that we need because we know we're going<br>to need skills<br>how long have we got to replenish those<br>skills by doing some skill training<br>within using some serious skill training<br>here of our own population it's those<br>sorts of conversations<br>that we've got to have um rather than<br>pretend that<br>the board is going to open and um we're<br>going to go back to normal in 12 months<br>time<br>thank you i'll um i'll combine it<br>there's a couple of questions here so<br>one is<br>as a double barrel question the the<br>first part is you've talked about a much<br>broader view of productivity<br>um first question how will you measure<br>that<br>so what does success look like and i<br>think<br>second and remember having having<br>established the measures like any good<br>sort of strategic plan<br>um what are the concrete steps new<br>zealand can take<br>in the near medium term to to achieve<br>those success measures<br>in less than 25 words yeah um well we're<br>still measuring productivity i mean<br>there's no issues about that and<br>statistics new zealand still measure<br>productivity<br>um the productivity commission will<br>still be putting out productivity by the<br>numbers<br>there's no change in any of that um<br>i see that as essential those are<br>critical tools for us to measure<br>i think what i put on top of it though<br>is let's not forget<br>those productivity measures if we<br>interpret them properly should<br>be viewed over a longer term rather than<br>a shorter term so let's stop<br>looking for um changes in productivity<br>growth<br>over six months or one year periods<br>let's start looking at them<br>seriously and appropriately but then<br>let's also start thinking about<br>other measures and i go to well-being<br>measures<br>because is that productivity changes are<br>they actually delivering<br>well-being let's look at productivity in<br>the sense of<br>let's look at some measures about how<br>well we're looking at at the state of<br>our assets<br>let's look at the the state of the<br>natural capital stock that we've got<br>let's look at the<br>human capital stock that we've got let's<br>look at the the<br>the physical capital stock let's look at<br>the the social capital stock so if<br>you're looking at measures<br>i prefer measures i mean i can go into<br>arguments about but i prefer measures<br>that look at the balance sheet rather<br>than the p<br>l because the balance sheet is what<br>we've got to play with going forward<br>the p l is very much change you know i'm<br>generalizing<br>that tends to be very much a backward<br>looking measure it says what you've done<br>in the past year<br>it doesn't give you a very good<br>indication about what you are able to do<br>in the next<br>two three four five ten years and i<br>think that's why the balance sheet<br>measures are way more important<br>not just from a well-being perspective<br>but dare i say from a productivity<br>perspective as well so<br>yes let's collate the productivity<br>numbers but then let's<br>also add in on them things around you<br>know<br>how is our natural capital working how<br>what is our human capital stock let's<br>look at those education measures<br>let's look at those skill based measures<br>um<br>i don't have all the answers and i don't<br>even pretend to have all the answers<br>i've been looking at productivity for 40<br>odd years and i've only in this new job<br>for<br>for four weeks um we'll probably be<br>and i don't want to be we'll probably be<br>in 40 years time still<br>looking at productivity it is the it is<br>the critical element that enables us to<br>deliver well-being<br>um so it's never a it's<br>it's never gonna we're never gonna<br>finish we should always continue to<br>strive for doing even better<br>with what we've got how we measure our<br>sag<br>let's look at those balance sheet<br>measures rather than the p l<br>thank you i might then expand on that<br>well-being theme and other questions<br>come through<br>with productivity growth well-being can<br>expand<br>what are the mechanisms by which we<br>ensure that that well-being is<br>more equitably distributed um<br>well that's where i'd probably have to<br>i'd i'll probably have to take my<br>productivity commission ahead on then<br>because i haven't<br>gone down that track yet i'd dearly love<br>to but<br>uh in my mind it's that social capital<br>element<br>um and it's social inclusion so as as<br>part of our<br>the way we drive productivity growth<br>um in if we do it properly means that<br>we're including all of our communities<br>means we're including um those who have<br>been left out in the past so we are<br>i won't say focusing on but we are<br>bringing inside the tent<br>um those communities who<br>haven't been who haven't got those human<br>capital skills<br>that all of us have have fortuitously<br>somehow developed<br>uh why haven't they why have they missed<br>out<br>let's start talking about policy let's<br>start engaging in a policy discussion<br>with those communities rather than<br>pretending we can deliver them for<br>on high from wellington or a university<br>or from a research think tank<br>uh because those communities have a lot<br>of lived experiences<br>they have assets as well and i think we<br>need to<br>engage with them if we seriously believe<br>that social capital is also part of our<br>asset pace<br>thank you i just i think if we got the<br>microphone there<br>uh we had one question in the room carl<br>yeah more of a a comment and a view i<br>suppose on their first very good<br>question which is about diversifying<br>i suppose the income streams of new<br>zealand the sectors<br>it's always interesting in these<br>downturns yeah you know if you're an<br>organization or a country there will be<br>some<br>segments of your income which disappear<br>which is very enlightening such as the<br>tourism and<br>i think that was north of 15 billion or<br>something<br>but what you also do is you start to<br>look at where your new emerging<br>income sources could come from so i<br>suppose i'm just adding a view<br>because it's the conversation not just<br>questions that i'd like us to<br>keep those emerging sectors such as the<br>tech export sector there<br>i'm from the galahad group we're proudly<br>new zealand's number one privately owned<br>tech exporter and we manufacture here<br>so um i think as as we go over the week<br>the conversation then about<br>how might we not have the tech export<br>sector growing by only one billion as<br>the fastest growing sector<br>but how do we get that up to actually be<br>long-term more sustainable<br>because if you have more income for the<br>country you've got a lot more to spend<br>on the well-being<br>more jobs and i even wonder questions<br>long<br>what could we do in new zealand to get<br>more high-value manufacturing going or<br>even<br>mid-level value manufacturing going<br>especially with the one percent<br>interest rate opportunity that<br>government might be able to pass on to<br>us<br>thanks carl uh ganesh any<br>any comments or reactions to that um i i<br>think there's nothing in there that um<br>that cause yeah no i'm probably in full<br>agreement um<br>yes we've got to diversify um in my dark<br>days i've<br>i've my some of my flippant comments as<br>we've been trying to diversify the new<br>zealand economy for at least 100 years<br>and but that shouldn't stop us trying um<br>yes high value manufacturing um i'm sure<br>you'll find some stuff out of our<br>frontier firms inquiry when we<br>publish it publish our final report<br>later this month<br>that will be around high value<br>manufacturing as well as<br>the link to r d and and innovation i<br>think that's critical and it's<br>and it sounds flippant but that<br>innovation ecosystem that we've<br>struggled with um i think we've got to<br>have another go at it<br>and let's not be<br>well let's be courageous rather than<br>great thank you ganesh look i'll um i'll<br>wrap it up there's<br>a lot of other questions come through<br>ranging from everything to a green new<br>deal to transitioning<br>jobs into into higher value higher wage<br>economy<br>um they're conversations i don't doubt<br>that you have on a daily basis<br>but we'll keep going i think for those<br>of us here in the room we'll be able to<br>keep the discussions going<br>for you ganesh a huge thank you thanks<br>for joining us remotely and thanks for<br>making the technology work in a way we<br>uh it was fine at our end so we<br>appreciate that<br>hopefully you uh you now have the joy of<br>being able to<br>download slido and pay for the other<br>presenters with questions<br>anonymously um so if you see um<br>if you see gn from wellington coming up<br>on the feed we'll we'll know it's you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
