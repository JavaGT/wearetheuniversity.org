give you my history and other<br>things and i'm quite happy to chat with<br>people afterwards if you wanted to<br>know that so they organizers thanks for<br>coming along thanks to the organizers<br>they gave me the broad topic and the<br>slightly smaller font the three doses of<br>healthy<br>healthy skepticism is what i added<br>without them<br>asking for it and so we'll see how<br>successful that is so i'm going to go<br>through three things<br>and then actually in the third i'm going<br>to go through another three so if i said<br>six it would already scare you off<br>and so the the three things are<br>pre-covered and performance was mediocre<br>it wasn't disastrous disastrous was<br>argentina and uruguay who were our peers<br>120 years ago but it was mediocre<br>the covert shock is especially to<br>economies<br>who specialize in services and despite<br>export education and despite tourism<br>that's not us<br>okay we specialize in agriculture and so<br>all else the same er respect<br>of policy responses we would have<br>expected an economy like new zealand to<br>not do as badly as many other economies<br>did okay<br>um it's i i tend not to focus on<br>policy makers i focus on policy because<br>sometimes<br>things get you know the policy maker as<br>hero or the policy maker is naive if<br>someone doesn't like trump<br>and so forth and it misses the deeper<br>fundamentals<br>uh and so that's what i want to be able<br>to focus on here<br>and then the three reasons for<br>skepticism are and<br>without being too ungreen i'm going to<br>twist the fern which is just blocking my<br>screen<br>it's plastic i think so i wouldn't have<br>broken it anyway and so<br>the first thing and it seems a bit of a<br>strange thing to say<br>from ganesha's talk and a lot of people<br>said well you know is zoom going to save<br>us and i'd actually put that into my<br>slides before i knew that we were a part<br>part on zoom and i would say no<br>we've seen this about 20 years ago a lot<br>of work on economic distance<br>the world is flat according to thomas<br>friedman of the new york times and the<br>deaf of distance he called it<br>francis ken cross of the economist<br>daughter of sir<br>the very very famous scottish economist<br>surya kin cross<br>and it was actually a former colleague<br>here phil mccain who pointed out that<br>actually it's not the world is curved<br>it's not flat<br>distance matters more than ever and so<br>it wasn't such a big puzzle for why new<br>zealand wasn't doing so badly despite<br>having<br>quite good policies at the time because<br>face-to-face communication sort of<br>things which occur in cities<br>became more important not less and so<br>i'll spend a little bit of time on that<br>but not too much because not my<br>my work i'll then talk about human<br>capital and we've got particularly large<br>issues i won't say problems but i'll say<br>issues here and so the particular<br>response that new zealand took<br>is putting burdens on to particular<br>generations and particularly ethnic<br>groups and i'm not sure that that's<br>a an ideal one and i'll also talk at the<br>end and this will get<br>um you know the pr people will start to<br>shift uneasily on their seats<br>because i'll talk about one of the two<br>inevitabilities of life<br>and i'm not going to talk about taxes<br>okay so i'm going to be talking about<br>death<br>okay and i'm going to point out that our<br>response to risk was probably<br>inefficient<br>probably inequitable and what i should<br>have added here as well is<br>it seemed fairly arbitrary and so<br>it increases the uncertainty going<br>forward<br>it's a deterrent to people's investment<br>from the way we've done things now<br>okay so go very quickly and grant scoby<br>i'm very<br>pleased to see grant here 30 years ago<br>when i first came to waikato we had<br>exactly this diagram<br>and it's about the competition for<br>resources and an economy<br>and at that stage the issue was that new<br>zealand was still supporting the<br>importable<br>sector the reserve bank also did work on<br>this<br>so roughly for every 10 percentage point<br>protection given to the importable<br>sector about 70<br>of that flowed back into the non-traded<br>goods sector and the characteristic of<br>non-traded goods is that their prices<br>are set domestically<br>they have captive consumers and so if<br>there's a demand increase for there then<br>they can simply<br>increase the price the tradable sector<br>which is exportables plus inputables<br>have their prices set on the world<br>market and what has been the structure i<br>should say too<br>these even though i've used black lines<br>here it's a bit fuzzy<br>so technology back office operation zoom<br>remote medicine all sorts of things<br>move the line things that used to be not<br>tradable can be tradable<br>and so the tradable sector seems to get<br>a bit bigger but the bigger effect is<br>the green arrow<br>the demand effect as we get richer we do<br>we demand more services and we demand<br>more<br>non-traded things like property and so<br>the non-traded sector is much bigger and<br>richer countries<br>and so the dominant effect is going to<br>be the green rather than red<br>now as many people know<br>in new zealand almost all of our growth<br>over the last two decades has occurred<br>in the non-traded part of the economy<br>and the problem for that from a product<br>point of view point of view is that the<br>non-traded part of the economy<br>can operate by and large with captive<br>consumers wellington's going to put its<br>rates up for 10 percent or whatever<br>because they didn't look after the pipes<br>you can't do anything about it unless<br>you move to auckland and then you're<br>going to have high rates there or unless<br>you move overseas you can't<br>import from amazon or from someone else<br>a<br>substitute for non-traded goods and<br>services but you can<br>if your local bookseller is selling the<br>prices for too high you just go on to<br>amazon and onto you shop right<br>and so there's a fundamental difficulty<br>in getting productivity growth<br>in the non-traded sector of the economy<br>because they don't have the spur<br>of international competition which<br>applies in the traded sector of the<br>economy<br>and so as i said down here many people<br>are many other people<br>may have pointed this out this is going<br>back to 1991<br>indexing there and this is in per capita<br>terms and this is production<br>gdp and so through<br>until the late 90s the non-traded the<br>the red hopefully no colorblind<br>people here i know illinois at victoria<br>is and so i shouldn't use colors and<br>things the traded part has basically<br>been static for<br>for 20 years the non-traded part has<br>increased by about<br>70 okay so that's using stats nz data if<br>we use<br>oecd data then export volumes in new<br>zealand<br>over the last 20 or so years<br>have grown by less than two percent per<br>annum we often compare ourselves to<br>australia<br>michael cullen used to point out while<br>australia can dig itself up and export<br>the the iron ore and so forth<br>australia's exports are growing much<br>faster than as at the same rate as the<br>oecd<br>the more sensible comparison in many<br>ways is to small oecd countries<br>because small countries need to trade<br>much more because they can't produce<br>everything locally<br>and the small oecd countries have export<br>growth of 5<br>per year and so these are countries<br>between 1 million and 8 million so it<br>excludes iceland<br>it excludes sweden but it's got the<br>baltics it's got the other scandinavians<br>it's got slovenia<br>slovak slovak republic and so forth okay<br>doesn't have singapore<br>because again that's a special case this<br>is using<br>world bank data because i'm not a<br>mercantilist the point of exporting is<br>so that we can buy imports and so this<br>is exports plus<br>imports relative to gdp from the world<br>bank and so we're always the black line<br>here the the right color choice to to<br>choose from new zealand<br>so we went from basically<br>slightly more relative to australia to<br>now being below the oecd average<br>and the comparative group of countries<br>the small oecd countries<br>increased their tradables share in ports<br>plus x<br>border walls imports plus exports to gdp<br>sorry by about 20 percentage points so<br>you might say well of course we're not<br>going to have as much trade as them<br>because they're in northern europe<br>or in the northern hemisphere so that<br>would be the level effect that you see<br>on the<br>vertical axis but that shouldn't account<br>for the change in the trends is<br>fundamentally different trend going on<br>here<br>okay all right okay so that was the the<br>the mediocre performance and and sorry<br>because<br>there's obviously a lot of people here<br>who have been involved in economic<br>policy<br>over this period it's not a criticism of<br>point out that we haven't actually done<br>as well as we sometimes think<br>now in order to think about how we would<br>respond to a shock like covet<br>it helps to go back to first principles<br>and so if we think of how the<br>economy is organized into sectors<br>agriculture industry and services<br>while agriculture the key part of<br>production for almost all forms of<br>agriculture except for<br>um intensive glass houses and<br>except for horticulture and vertical<br>farming in cities is space<br>okay space is a key input into<br>production workers are<br>dispersed and buyers and sellers are<br>normally also spatially dispersed apart<br>from going to a farmer's market<br>most people eating their food never know<br>the person who grows<br>grew their food industry is a bit harder<br>and so at the beginning of the pandemic<br>because wuhan is central to<br>automobile supply chains and there was<br>actually quite a lot of disruption to<br>supply change<br>in other countries um and often the<br>assembly line production takes some<br>additional changes and so<br>ppp put in place plastic shields robots<br>sanitizing robots etc but by and large<br>industry also is coped pretty well again<br>when is the last time any of us ever<br>went to the factory to buy something we<br>never do so buyers and sellers for<br>industrial goods and<br>goods are again separated by a long<br>distance<br>services is totally different services<br>traditionally requires face-to-face<br>and so when we look for example at<br>agglomeration economies which is<br>the amount by which bigger places are<br>more productive or pay higher wages<br>that almost always comes through the<br>services sector it doesn't come through<br>manufacturing it certainly doesn't come<br>through through agriculture<br>indeed one of the main explanations we<br>have for the existence of cities<br>why put up with the congestion in<br>wellington or in<br>in auckland is because of the<br>productivity advantage of having<br>more direct face-to-face communication<br>with your<br>input suppliers your colleagues your<br>collaborators<br>and also the direct matching of buyers<br>and sellers<br>because most services require you<br>experience and they take<br>time to do it so all else the same we<br>would expect<br>economies to be who rely on services to<br>do pretty badly<br>and this is from the january it's the<br>most recent<br>world economic out look of the imf<br>it doesn't include new zealand because<br>it only includes the 30 countries which<br>contribute their biggest share of world<br>gdp which is 83<br>but you see very clearly that for every<br>additional five percent increase<br>in the share of services and gdp in 2019<br>the real gdp growth rate in 2020 dropped<br>one percentage point<br>okay and you'll say okay well look<br>us uk spain those are rich indonesia<br>india egypt china those are poor<br>is it being driven by income you get<br>exactly the same relationship if you<br>condition on<br>gdp of these countries as well for<br>agriculture<br>it's exactly the opposite for every five<br>percentage point increase in the share<br>of agriculture and gdp<br>then gdp growth in 2020 was one percent<br>higher than it otherwise was so the<br>shock was not as<br>as big as it would be so where's new<br>zealand while new zealand has gdp as six<br>percent<br>of coming from the agricultural sector<br>versus the oecd average of one percent<br>so we've already got a five percentage<br>point gap which would account already<br>for one percentage point<br>more growth in new zealand than we<br>expected irrespective<br>of whether we had good or bad policy<br>responses right just due to our economic<br>structure<br>and so we luckily<br>in this period specialized in the sector<br>which can most easily cope with social<br>distancing<br>that's exactly what life on the farm is<br>it's a lot of real estate to go and and<br>and do things and the sector which can<br>least easily cope<br>is services and despite export education<br>and despite tourism we're not a services<br>intensive economy compared with<br>most other rich countries okay so does<br>this<br>herald a new dawn and<br>quite a lot of writing<br>has come out in the covet era saying<br>well you know there's all sorts of other<br>problems climate change and so on and so<br>forth we need to reshape the economy<br>reset the economy and so forth<br>as i said here we'll zoom save us<br>because we'll have<br>ongoing social distancing we'll have<br>some decline in face-to-face services<br>will remoteness become an advantage if<br>we could ever get the border properly<br>managed<br>my view no okay skeptically my view is<br>no<br>okay and so our pre-covered mediocrity<br>will return but in<br>addition our covert response has opened<br>up new vulnerabilities which weren't<br>there precovered okay<br>and so we've got new problems to grapple<br>with because of our particular response<br>to this<br>shock okay so let me go um through and<br>just two slides on this before i go to<br>the two in a little bit more<br>detail so as i said 20 years ago<br>there was this belief that the world was<br>becoming flat<br>because ikea and amazon and everyone<br>else<br>who's got a really efficient supply<br>chain could send goods and serve goods<br>and some services<br>back office operations around the world<br>really cheaply um<br>how am i doing for time matt cool okays<br>and i'll give a little<br>my current house is made out of an<br>entire container load of building<br>material<br>which i imported from british columbia<br>um for four thousand bucks<br>not for buying the materials shipping it<br>from from british columbia from<br>vancouver to busan to tauranga it cost<br>me almost as much<br>to get it from tauranga to clear to<br>mirror edge and to get to hamilton and<br>then to my<br>rental property so things that are<br>relatively standardized containerization<br>information and so forth become really<br>really cheap<br>okay and really efficient and so the<br>argument is well<br>the cost of engaging in activities<br>across space so trying to build your<br>house across space or buying<br>materials across space in my case has<br>fallen so<br>remote places should be less<br>disadvantaged and this is what then<br>caused<br>puzzles for people and phil mccann when<br>he was here wrote a lot on those people<br>people were puzzled well we should be<br>becoming closer now and we've got good<br>policies<br>and so why aren't we doing why is our<br>productivity so badly why is our<br>tradable sector<br>and i think it's the right one is that<br>it ignores<br>complementarities this story is all<br>about<br>substitution and the way i'm going to<br>explain it is<br>it's akin to the lump of labor fallacy<br>and those of you<br>many of you will know the lump of labor<br>fallacy is the idea<br>there's a given stock of jobs to do<br>something threatens those jobs such as<br>the machine<br>so blood and the other ludwites go and<br>smash the machine<br>or something threatens those jobs<br>because there's more productive workers<br>such as rse workers coming from the<br>pacific to pick horticultural crops who<br>are about 30 to 40<br>more productive than the new zealand<br>workers and so<br>the dominant story is about substitution<br>the reality is the machine comes<br>we become more productive when we're<br>more productive we're richer<br>when we're richer we demand more goods<br>and services and so in the long run both<br>the machine<br>and the more efficient labor from abroad<br>are complements<br>rather than substitutes and the reason<br>why over two centuries we got much<br>richer<br>isn't because we kept on looking for<br>better and better substitution<br>possibilities but doing fundamentally<br>the same thing<br>it's because of the opportunities<br>provided by complementarity<br>now so keep that story in mind and let<br>me go to the next slide<br>and there's the triple asterisks because<br>it's so important here<br>this is phil mccann's answer okay<br>despite the fact that shipping a package<br>with amazon or from ikea<br>or me shipping my building materials<br>across the oceans has got much cheaper<br>spatial transactions costs have actually<br>risen<br>because with better information<br>technologies<br>we demand more the quantity variety<br>and complexity of the knowledge that is<br>communicated rises<br>and much of this is non-standard and<br>tacit so it requires face to face<br>and so there is a premium on location<br>there's not a penalty for<br>central location there's a penalty<br>remaining for remoteness and this is<br>the same issue and so yes zoom will make<br>us more productive<br>because we're more productive we'll be<br>richer because we're richer we're going<br>to demand<br>more of everything and one of the things<br>we like is<br>travel and meeting people and so on and<br>so forth so i don't see this as a<br>fundamental reset i don't see this<br>as a substitution it's the<br>complementarity which is going to be the<br>key thing here okay so<br>others may disagree but um but that's<br>that's my take or not<br>okay so the vulnerabilities we've opened<br>ourselves up to so so just as a little<br>uh primer and the expert on this is<br>sitting in the middle of the room so<br>human capital in new zealand is worth<br>about three times the value of physical<br>capital<br>and it's risen over time and human<br>capital when these calculations are made<br>is simply the expected discounted value<br>of lifetime earnings<br>allowing for the risk of death and the<br>risk of unemployment<br>and also allowing for the age cohort<br>earnings growth which we would expect to<br>occur<br>so you can immediately see that a<br>pandemic is going to affect human<br>capital because increases the risk of<br>death<br>this particular pandemic is not going to<br>have much effect on human capital<br>because the mortality is so skewed to<br>the woods the elderly i used australian<br>data because<br>we don't present point data for the<br>deaths in new zealand that i've seen<br>but it's going to be very much the same<br>so in australia 93 percent of the covert<br>deaths<br>are aged 70 year old and so there's very<br>little direct effect<br>on human capital jeffrey rice's book<br>black november tells us about 6 000<br>people dying in in the<br>novel on the spanish flu and the median<br>age was 30 to 35<br>that affects human capital okay covert<br>directly doesn't affect human capital<br>indirectly it has a huge effect because<br>of the response to covert not because of<br>covert per se<br>and so the indirect effect comes from<br>closing schools and replacing in-person<br>learning<br>with what is a very imperfect substitute<br>which is remote learning<br>so in the us the san francisco fed<br>calculated just last month<br>that in 25 years time us output will be<br>half of a percentage point lower<br>because of the impairment human capital<br>that's occurred during this period<br>and it's not an even impairment<br>mckinsey calculated that by june 2021 so<br>u.s schools<br>by and large shut march last year so<br>they've gone 15 months<br>without school they have pretty big<br>summer holidays over there<br>um for students of color and this is<br>predominantly black students<br>they will have lost 12 up to 12 months<br>of learning okay so over there is 15<br>months i've only had about three months<br>native learning<br>there's a loss also for white students<br>but it's only about half as large<br>and so the loss is disproportionately<br>born by poorer<br>browner blacker migrant students than by<br>our white richer students okay and<br>there's all sorts of reasons why we<br>expect this to occur<br>now in new zealand we had earlier return<br>to face-to-face learning<br>we had lots of innovative things we had<br>i think<br>susie cato and that back on tv talking<br>to children through<br>this all sorts of educational things the<br>university pulled out all the stops as<br>did all the other institutions<br>but there is no denying the fact<br>that it is an imperfect substitute<br>because it was better we would already<br>have been doing it<br>okay it's because we were forced to do<br>remote learning that we did it<br>so in new zealand we already had<br>big issues in human capital between<br>ethnic groups<br>and so normally<br>when we see the correlation between<br>people who've got more<br>education and higher wages or higher<br>earnings<br>we don't know is it because the<br>educators have actually<br>caused that we've given them more human<br>capital we hope that's true<br>that's what we comfort ourselves with uh<br>when we<br>look back on our careers or instead is<br>it simply the fact that there are<br>already pre-existing differences in<br>productivity<br>which couldn't be known unless you had<br>some way to signal it by accumulating a<br>credential<br>and so that's more of a bleak story<br>because all we're doing is giving a<br>piece of paper to certify<br>that this person was productive and this<br>was not it turns out there is a<br>remarkable difference<br>between european pakeha and maori<br>pacific<br>in these relationships and so normally<br>in new zealand because the census and<br>the surveys only ask about<br>highest qualification we can't unpack<br>this difference but there was a survey a<br>few years ago which asked<br>both about the number of years and also<br>the pieces of<br>paper the credentials collected along<br>the way so this is for people like me<br>this is for european pakia<br>and so if it's not very clear this is<br>years of education so<br>below nine is is the omitted category<br>that's pre-high school basically<br>and it goes all the way up to 21 plus if<br>you've got a phd it's more like 25 or 26<br>it's probably bending over ah they've<br>got earnings<br>which are 50 greater conditional long<br>qualifications<br>if we didn't condition on qualifications<br>would be 100 greater which is why i said<br>it's about half and half<br>for european pakia for the returns to<br>human capital versus the returns to<br>signaling or credentialing<br>for maori and pacific just check i<br>haven't gone backwards before this might<br>end in disaster not good it didn't for<br>mario and pacific<br>the return is entirely the credentials<br>and particularly<br>it's to credentials with postgraduate<br>and so if you're marion pacific<br>and you've got postgraduate then you've<br>got a far bigger percentage increase in<br>earnings than would be the case for<br>pacquiao<br>but the labor market for whatever reason<br>whether it be because there was not in<br>fact human capital going on in the<br>schooling system<br>or it wasn't being recognized for<br>whatever reason<br>the labor market for maori and pacific<br>looks like that<br>it's totally flat now this is survey<br>data hopefully someone will go into the<br>integrated data infrastructure and do a<br>million observations and the standard<br>errors which are the brown bars will get<br>smaller but it's a<br>fundamentally different pattern okay and<br>it's obviously an individual tragedy<br>it's a community tragedy<br>but it's an aggregate tragedy because by<br>2038<br>the pacific share of the population<br>grows 40 the maori share grows by 25<br>pacquiao shares down 12. about 40<br>percent of children in school in<br>2038 are in pacific and if it is truly<br>the case<br>that their human capital wasn't being<br>recognized or wasn't actually being<br>formed<br>in the usual circumstances then how much<br>worse is it going to be<br>in the remote learning circumstances<br>where the resources available to them<br>typically were much worse right so<br>that's a really big problem<br>and we've pushed a lot of adjustment<br>onto this onto this generation<br>okay so um last one<br>okay anyone here ever been to the world<br>bank headquarters in washington<br>you know what's carved on the stone in<br>the front<br>a dream a world free of poverty it's the<br>world bank mission statement right<br>writing<br>this should be carved in the front of<br>the ministry of health building in<br>wellington<br>right if we misperceive risk and we<br>invest excessively in<br>reducing some risks then what we do and<br>this is<br>viscusi who's the grandfather of all<br>economic approaches to risk analysis we<br>pay<br>more than we should for health gains<br>that are less than we could achieve<br>right if we get the balance wrong we pay<br>more than we should<br>for health gains that are less than we<br>can achieve right i'm going to argue<br>that's probably what we've done on<br>covert i know not everyone here is going<br>to agree on<br>it the larger problem is that the sort<br>of analyses to work out whether we paid<br>more than we should<br>haven't been done the decisions have<br>been made without<br>going back to a framework for decision<br>making for risk under uncertainty and<br>that seems to be<br>a huge risk going forward because that's<br>where the arbitrariness can come in<br>okay so there's to put it bluntly<br>three broad ways we can respond to a new<br>risk to human health<br>some people are gonna get sick and some<br>people gonna die so there's a morbidity<br>and a mortality response<br>we can forego current output in order to<br>increase safety<br>okay shelter at home uh spend a lot of<br>money which we didn't used to spend on<br>hand sanitizer and on ppp and things<br>like that and the third one which is<br>less commonly discussed in literature<br>is we can kick the can down the road<br>because we can borrow<br>and so our descendants will have some<br>call on their future output in order<br>that we buffer our consumption while we<br>reduce output okay so we're going to<br>push some of the adjustment potentially<br>onto the<br>onto the future okay so this is the the<br>def output dit um triangle<br>and we've got a scale here because we<br>actually have well-established things<br>um for working out how much weight to<br>put on this and so<br>for death versus output we've got the<br>value of statistical life and we've got<br>quality adjusted life years<br>for output debt it's not quite right<br>it's more output now<br>or consumption now consumption in the<br>future the interest rate on the rate of<br>time preference<br>the third leg is not really talked about<br>very much and so i'll<br>be welcomed for people to suggest better<br>but i would suggest the following<br>the debt service ratio how much of the<br>future output is not available to the<br>future generation because it's repaying<br>the debt<br>that we use to keep our consumption high<br>multiplied by the income elasticity of<br>life expectancy okay and i'll talk about<br>the income elasticity of life expectancy<br>a little bit<br>it's basically the idea that in richer<br>time periods<br>in richer societies and within societies<br>for richer groups<br>life expectancy is higher and the reason<br>we don't<br>spend all of the output in making things<br>totally safe<br>is that is perverse because we destroy<br>so much output that we actually increase<br>mortality rather than decreasing it and<br>there's lots of papers on there<br>okay so new zealand's<br>approach of<br>the bottom trade-off sorry of the death<br>output trade-off and it's not quite<br>value of statistical life in most cases<br>it's been quality of life years<br>martin lally formerly at victoria has<br>done the most on this<br>he's done it ex-post and ex-ante in all<br>sorts of different ways<br>and finds that the implied<br>value of live saved or life years saved<br>from the response to covert were about<br>40 times<br>existing benchmarks used by pharmac or<br>used by ministry of transport<br>okay heatley at the productivity<br>commission<br>which really was done as a primer for<br>treasury and for others as to how we<br>could do this but it's now published in<br>new zealand economic papers<br>um looked at the level four extension of<br>five days last april<br>looked at the quality adjusted life<br>years that were<br>saved by that under epidemiological<br>models versus those that were cost<br>and the cost were 100 times the benefits<br>and then in harrison who<br>looked only at construction uh which<br>again<br>this is where a small scale building<br>actually would have been a help<br>because not a whole bunch of people in a<br>factory it's two guys typically two guys<br>holding up some pre-cut stuff so they're<br>distanced by about four or five meters<br>and in calculated that the costs were<br>about 300 times the benefits right<br>the particular values are not super<br>important the<br>fact that these sorts of analyses were<br>by and large entirely absent from the<br>public sector the ministry of health the<br>treasury didn't do them<br>or certainly didn't publicize them and<br>people have put in oias and haven't<br>found them<br>is the bigger a worry because it means<br>that we can do these same sorts of<br>decisions again in the next crisis<br>and we don't have any framework for for<br>making difficult choices<br>okay so this is a bit small from the<br>back i apologize this is from the<br>short-term mortality<br>forecast database fluctuation database<br>not forecast<br>this is total deaths this is not covert<br>deaths this is total deaths<br>week by week and so from week one of the<br>year to week<br>52 of the year blue is periods<br>where in 2020 total deaths in that week<br>or the total death rate<br>was below the long run average which was<br>the average from 2010 to 2019<br>and normally in new zealand deaths peak<br>in july and i show you the 2017 flu<br>season<br>where the death rate peaked at around<br>about 950 per hundred thousand<br>the remarkable thing about the top<br>diagram is that new zealand overall for<br>2020 has no excess mortality at all<br>and so faced facing this difficult<br>trade-off here<br>there is no work at all going on in<br>this leg over here all of the work is<br>going to go on to the output and the<br>debt<br>legs but not onto the diff and mortality<br>leak we're not the only country<br>norway has the exact same pattern as<br>well but most countries<br>around the world and i use finland as an<br>example show<br>either somewhat higher excess mortality<br>which is the orange and so the mortality<br>rate in 2020 was above the average for<br>the last 10 years in that particular<br>week<br>or so considerable peaks and so the uk<br>scotland shows up in this and so a big<br>peak in april<br>slovenia shows a big peak towards the<br>end of the year for example so we have<br>no excess mortality<br>uh last year and so instead what did we<br>do we went big on debt<br>so this is from the imf this is the<br>fiscal monitor of<br>january 2021 we have the largest<br>response of any advanced country<br>so that makes it likely we have the<br>largest response of any country because<br>the<br>lower income countries generally are not<br>going to have the ability to take on<br>debt<br>and in particular if you compare to a<br>small oecd<br>comparison group we're about four times<br>as large<br>response to taking on debt okay<br>and so we can then do a triangle and so<br>this is one of these diagrams where you<br>want to be close to the origin<br>getting to point one everything scaled<br>to one and the three legs is being worst<br>in class<br>and these are the codes for the small<br>oecd countries from denmark through to<br>slovenia again<br>new zealand is always black because of<br>the all blacks and so<br>our triangle is right on the origin for<br>death<br>only norway had a smaller mortality<br>change in 2020 than we did amongst this<br>group of countries<br>we have the third biggest output decline<br>and we have easily the biggest<br>increase in debt okay so there's<br>trade-offs involved<br>we can find a country for example norway<br>dominates us totally<br>it's got a smaller small it's closer to<br>the ax to the origin in all three<br>dimensions and so it's<br>sometimes there's a lot of you know best<br>in class didn't we do well etcetera<br>etcetera i think that<br>revolves around people simply not<br>looking broadly enough at<br>the information out there so our<br>response is really skewed to death<br>and it's somewhat skewed towards<br>mortality okay so what are the<br>implications of this well<br>again we were faced with a brand new<br>risk<br>there's three broad ways we could<br>respond we only used two of them<br>this raises the possibility in future<br>well what happens when the next brand<br>new risk comes along<br>will we do the same will we do this for<br>flu season every winter<br>right we already go back my students<br>hate it when i go forward and back<br>but you see the 2017 flu season peak was<br>about 30 percent higher than the 2020<br>covert<br>peak right is that the right response to<br>risk because in 2017 we weren't doing<br>any of these particular things and no<br>i'm not a just the flu person but these<br>are what the<br>the data show us here right so that's<br>the first thing the second one actually<br>i need to go back again sorry i should<br>think more clearly look at the blue so<br>we're below average in 2020<br>we can't stay below average every year<br>averages don't work that way<br>most other countries who are<br>contemplating opening up<br>had above average mortality in 2020 and<br>so they are likely to have a<br>below average mortality in 2021 and 2022<br>irrespective of whether it's due to the<br>vaccine or due to the<br>cruel fact that some people who might<br>otherwise have died in 2022 died in<br>2020.<br>in contrast we've got people who didn't<br>die in 2020 and i can imagine the<br>newspaper hitting headline<br>economist says more people should have<br>died in 2020. that's not at all what i'm<br>saying<br>i'm simply pointing out that an<br>implication of our approach<br>is that we had below average with<br>mortality below our own average<br>we cannot keep that up forever and a day<br>it must become above average at some<br>stage and it's highly likely that that<br>will be coincident with<br>tentative steps to open up the economy<br>to the rest of the world<br>and one could imagine a considerable<br>amount of backtracking and backsliding<br>because of that<br>whereas other countries even if their<br>steps are not super successful even if<br>the vaccines are not as good as<br>advertised<br>they will not risk they will not have<br>that problem because<br>unfortunately and it seems harsh to say<br>it but people died in 2020 who otherwise<br>would have died in 2021 2022.<br>okay just as i know<br>i know i can't take too much of your<br>patience by giving another aside but<br>some of you will have seen last week<br>that the cdc in the<br>us announced that covert had reduced<br>life expectancy by one year<br>well they assume that the pattern of<br>mortality in 2020 applies every year<br>for 60 70 years into the future for a<br>hypothetical cohort<br>born in 2020 so in their case you can be<br>above<br>average every year by that reasoning if<br>we do the more reasonable thing of<br>looking at people alive at the start of<br>2020<br>how many years of life did the whole u.s<br>population expect to live<br>how many years were lost take the ratio<br>of those it's five days<br>okay so the average impact on life<br>expectancy of covert in the united<br>states was five days<br>spread across everyone right and so<br>again an understanding of relative risk<br>seems to have been<br>lost here okay so our debt intensive<br>response is going to burden the next<br>generation and potentially creates<br>perverse impacts on life expectancy<br>actions to save lives can end up costing<br>lives okay<br>and so this relies on the fact that<br>across space<br>across time within countries there's a<br>very very strong relationship between<br>income in this case gdp and life<br>expectancy<br>in the new zealand case it's 50 larger<br>than most other rich countries and so<br>this is a general example of us<br>doing a lot with a little we have a<br>really high human development index<br>ranking<br>even though our gdp ranking is pretty<br>low but the problem is<br>that that means that reductions in<br>future output are going to have<br>particularly large impacts on life<br>expectancy here which they weren't in<br>other places<br>and so last year at the time of the<br>preview<br>i ran the calculations based on the<br>forecast<br>path of output i know things have<br>recovered a bit since then<br>and we would have 10 more than 10 times<br>reduction in life expectancy from lower<br>future output<br>than would have occurred from a<br>reasonable mitigation strategy again<br>it's<br>it's a trade-off right it may be a<br>trade-off that everyone's happy about<br>but it's a trade-off which hasn't been<br>terribly widely<br>brought out so i know i've gone past 20<br>minutes um<br>so let me finish with just the last<br>bullet point which is that from my point<br>of view<br>the discussion in new zealand has been<br>remarkably free<br>of consideration of these sorts of<br>trade-offs okay my hope is that this<br>uh one day forum will at least make up<br>for a late start in bringing us<br>somewhat more into the trade-off space<br>we're good brilliant thank you john<br>um i'll just stand here so um<br>i'll just check first we'll go to the<br>room first are there any questions<br>yes we've got a mic for eric at the<br>front of the room<br>and then i'll go online<br>superb job as usual john that is great a<br>couple quick questions if i might<br>one reason that we might think this time<br>is different around remote stuff<br>a lot of changes got bedded in this time<br>around ability to work remotely and have<br>some of those complementarities at a<br>distance<br>that would have been really difficult to<br>achieve otherwise they were forced to<br>take on some of these fixed costs that<br>could potentially sustain itself now<br>you're never going to get the new<br>connections being built that way but you<br>should be able to maintain existing ones<br>a lot better so you'd think that there'd<br>be opportunities for people to remote<br>work from new zealand<br>getting paid by their american employers<br>and you could start thinking about that<br>as a potential<br>new growth area for us if we look a bit<br>attractive<br>the second so i was wondering whether<br>you think that there's any chance of<br>that is it like a one chance and three<br>one chance and a million<br>what kind of where on the scale would<br>you be betting on that second question<br>is on on your death and<br>gdp stuff one of the problems that i've<br>had with some of the analysis that had<br>been done previously is around the<br>counter factuals and you made a really<br>good point about the share of the<br>services economy as mattering<br>substantially in this<br>have you seen anybody put out a<br>reasonable<br>counter counter-factual forecast of what<br>new zealand's gdp<br>would have been if we had been as covet<br>impaired as everywhere else<br>taking into account that different<br>industrial structure okay<br>shout out to each one okay so so for the<br>first one<br>short answer i think it's entirely<br>possible that people could<br>remote work from new zealand overseas<br>the problem is and and you know i was<br>tempted to add a fourth<br>vulnerability is we've moved from an<br>area of<br>price-based to non-price based so we<br>don't know what the shadow value of an<br>extra spot in<br>miq is right and the the idea that<br>prices convey information has either<br>been<br>never learned and if so then my<br>colleagues and i and the university<br>sector<br>just like deserve a good kicking or else<br>has been unlearned<br>because before i came here 30 years ago<br>i was working at lincoln with tony<br>rainer and ralph lettermore and what we<br>were<br>looking at was the terrification of the<br>import licensing regime<br>because we had protection from input<br>licensing which we had no idea how much<br>it was<br>because it was non-um non-price-based<br>and one of muldoon's small<br>dipping hysto into the liberalization<br>waters was starting to auction those off<br>in 1982<br>which led to the syntek report and this<br>huge protective<br>we are basically in exactly the same<br>setting now eric is that we don't know<br>what value<br>to place on miq spaces we don't know<br>what value should be expanding them or<br>not and who's got the highest value for<br>them and again this is<br>just seems to be a natural one for for<br>using price-based systems and so i know<br>that's not answering your question<br>because i don't know the forecast<br>but it's making it allowed me to subtly<br>bring in the fourth point i would have<br>made and i didn't collude with eric to<br>do it either<br>thanks thank you um one from the uh<br>the phones or the live stream see any<br>empirical work been done around<br>the developed world measuring the impact<br>of enforced time away from school<br>during lockdown and then there was<br>another question about comparing<br>a new zealand experience obviously we<br>went through a different experience over<br>the last years versus say the us<br>yeah so yeah there's a lot of work<br>coming out of the u.s where um<br>i would for people unfamiliar uh emily<br>oster<br>uh has done a particularly large amount<br>of work in the u.s and arguing that<br>schools should be reopened<br>as soon as possible and shouldn't have<br>closed um the very sad story just came<br>out of sweden i think yesterday or<br>the day before a pediatrician working at<br>the karolinska<br>institute who was also studying the<br>impact of<br>schools being closed and was arguing for<br>schools being opened and even though we<br>think of<br>sweden as this uber rational place which<br>adopted this cold heartless approach and<br>that<br>that chap has been so vilified online<br>that he's<br>moved his research away from doing this<br>okay and so just<br>just just saw it yesterday right so this<br>has become the problem with this<br>particular virus has become incredibly<br>politicized<br>right and so rational discussion about<br>some of these things is you know<br>is is just been impossible in ways which<br>for example the 57 or the 68 pandemics<br>didn't occur in in the same sort of<br>environments and yet in aggregate<br>probably are<br>more of this is much more like them than<br>it is ever like 28 um<br>1918 so yeah so so so i'd say look first<br>to emily oster<br>thank you um you touched a little bit<br>about<br>replacement of skills and so on there's<br>a question came through what's your view<br>on the ideal<br>immigration settings in order for us to<br>grow<br>productivity wellbeing in a post-covered<br>world<br>so i sort of alluded when talking about<br>the lump of labor idea<br>um i i do quite a lot of work with um or<br>historically over the first 10 years of<br>the rse<br>those of you who don't know the<br>abbreviation the seasonal work scheme<br>that brings in<br>people from the pacific islands to pick<br>and prune and and<br>pack and so forth um and what we<br>see there and and that was a scheme that<br>was up to about 14 000 workers per year<br>by 2019 so about 0.4<br>of a percent of the new zealand<br>workforce was was an rsc worker it's<br>actually non-non-trivial amount<br>um the evidence of that is that by and<br>large it led to complementarity effects<br>the growers expanded<br>their outcomes and they hired more new<br>zealand workers and so there was a<br>report done by the productivity<br>commission i think it was chapter five<br>which basically was all dominated by<br>substitution this is bringing in cheaper<br>workers<br>and so if we shut that off it will<br>increase the demand for local workers<br>this by large doesn't happen i think i<br>saw 58 workers<br>had been hired by some scheme to move<br>people out there<br>the problem is that workers come in all<br>different<br>shapes and sizes and locations we've got<br>hundreds and hundreds of labor demand<br>curves and hundreds and hundreds of<br>labor supply curves<br>and the fact that there are jobs over in<br>the hawke's bay at these particular<br>months of the year<br>doesn't really help someone who's<br>unemployed in hamilton or auckland or<br>somewhere like that<br>the great thing i think about the rsc<br>was it built into the complementarity<br>of a comparative advantage and so i did<br>calculations which showed that new<br>zealand exports were about a billion<br>dollars a year higher because of the rsc<br>now i can't say that's the same for all<br>migration streams<br>i'd be quite happy if all migration<br>streams did have to go through a<br>cost-benefit analysis of the kind that<br>the rse has gone through<br>to then work it out because you know<br>there is a lot of belief or debate that<br>you know too much migration<br>has been the driving force um<br>if we can buzz all the way backwards you<br>know one um<br>can we no two i can't do it i turn it<br>off um<br>but this divergence between the<br>non-tradables and tradables one<br>hypothesis is that<br>too much migration my hypothesis would<br>be to look at the 2002 local government<br>act<br>which gave general competence to local<br>authorities and so there would be a huge<br>expansion in the range of things they<br>did<br>and probably not doing some of the core<br>things they should be doing like<br>depreciating the pipes<br>um and so but again that's a<br>backward-looking thing not a<br>forward-looking thing<br>thank you are there any other questions<br>in the room there's a lot coming through<br>and i yes<br>uh thank you for your insights here<br>professor gibson i'm just<br>interested in the um you're talking<br>about the pre-existing gaps<br>from uh on a from an ethnic basis um i<br>suppose i'm a little bit interested in<br>some of the solutions that are being<br>thrown around at the moment<br>as to try and alleviate that issue<br>where quite a significant portion of the<br>workforce will be maori pacifica<br>and there'll be a little bit of a<br>decline from the um from the pakistan as<br>well so<br>are you able to give us some uh insights<br>on some solutions perhaps in that space<br>um solutions no it's in in truth<br>um i'm not an educational economist i<br>sometimes do labor economics and so<br>finding this sort of pattern<br>is sort of this this will sound like a<br>cop-out i'm sure<br>um is part of my job other people then<br>responding to the<br>the pathness to what was going on okay<br>so i don't know<br>what is the way to to deal with it i<br>don't know is it<br>coming entirely from the employers is it<br>an employer bias<br>what what i called in that article<br>statistical discrimination<br>or is it a fundamental problem of um the<br>human capital production function just<br>not working very well for whatever<br>reason for<br>for maori pacifica and perhaps rather<br>for immigrant children as well i don't<br>know we don't<br>have them there i don't know but<br>certainly that seems to be something<br>which should be front of mind<br>for people who are researching in that<br>area<br>thank you i think a last question then<br>before we break<br>um you made a critical point that you<br>know in<br>echoing i guess what i opened with we're<br>one year on now from that whirlwind of<br>activity where<br>there just wasn't time to do a lot of<br>the analysis i think a theme of these<br>two days is that we have time we have to<br>take time we have to bring that rigor in<br>how do you and this question came<br>through over slaughter<br>how do you see the government agencies<br>productivity commission treasury others<br>bringing more rigor and more trade-off<br>analysis what's the right way to get<br>that into the policy discussion<br>well we we had pre-existing<br>i guess i'll say benchmarks rules is too<br>strong of a word<br>we're very we have been historically<br>very strong in in<br>in the area of macro rules rather than<br>discretion so the reserve bank act the<br>um<br>fiscal responsibility act um we don't<br>seem to have the same<br>constraint in terms of either regulatory<br>or<br>safety or public health and perhaps if<br>we did because we had guidelines for you<br>know pharmac every day is having to make<br>really difficult decisions on funding<br>things<br>they're people building safer roads are<br>making difficult decisions of<br>prioritization we had these it's the<br>fact that these<br>basically as i see it and i might be<br>wrong and i apologize in advance of<br>anyone in the room or on<br>line was part of this and seems like a<br>criticism they basically went out the<br>window<br>right they basically were not either<br>adhered to<br>or called up either x anti or even<br>x post and it's not clear there doesn't<br>seem to be justice there it doesn't seem<br>to be a terribly<br>clear timetable to how do we open up<br>again<br>nor does this seem to be a very clear<br>time to able to<br>how do we go back to what i'd call a<br>rules-based order okay and again that's<br>not saying the politicians are rule<br>breakers<br>but it's it's how do we go back to<br>essentially doing<br>things in in a rational scientific way<br>and maybe it's impossible<br>right maybe in in a world of twitter and<br>pylons and so forth maybe it's simply<br>not possible because the costs of doing<br>things in that way<br>are too hard that's not my specialty as<br>to why those things happen right but<br>that's been that seems to me to be going<br>forward the big uncertainty if i was an<br>entrepreneur i'd be really worried about<br>this sort of thing happening again<br>because there doesn't seem to be any<br>timetable to a return to<br>normal approaches to decision making<br>thank you john all right we are going to<br>wrap so another round of applause for<br>professor john goodson</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
