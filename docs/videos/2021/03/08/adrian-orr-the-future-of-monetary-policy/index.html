their ipad<br>here is it<br>i'll set up netflix while we're here but<br>um<br>many hands make light work and over the<br>last 12 months<br>new zealand has proved that globally<br>that has been the call<br>and really what i hope we can do is<br>bottle<br>that spirit bottle that idea and<br>continue to use it going forward<br>and so this morning i'll chat a little<br>bit around<br>where we've come from over the last 12<br>months or so<br>it feels like a much longer period than<br>that for all of us<br>but also the issues that we face in the<br>near to<br>ahead and there will be no surprises i<br>do want to say<br>thank you victoria if you are still<br>logged on<br>your speech was a fantastic set up for<br>what i have to say and and truly that<br>spirit<br>of the central bank working with other<br>government agencies but also<br>especially industry was incredibly<br>important that two-way flow of<br>information<br>identifying risks liquidity issues so on<br>and so forth was was<br>critical to our success and<br>kyota alan i haven't broken it yet but<br>i've given it a good crack<br>um your old shop of tipu tmr2 of the<br>reserve bank<br>um suffice to say there's no corner that<br>has gone<br>challenged or or turned upside down to<br>see how we can<br>keep things going when our traditional<br>tool<br>the official cash rate started to run<br>out of room<br>so so it was wonderful the foundations<br>that previous governors have left<br>was was a great place to stand cured<br>neil i promise to be on best behavior<br>professor neil quigley is not only the<br>boss of waikato university but he's also<br>my boss<br>as chair of the reserve bank of new<br>zealand thank you for your support<br>over recent periods of time and<br>don't feel personally insulted that no<br>one's joined the table with you neil<br>it's um that's just your manner in the<br>room that's<br>um on the way through uh<br>the speech i'm going to try something um<br>different which is actually try and<br>stick to script so far<br>i've failed because i haven't even<br>looked at it yet so so i'm going to turn<br>to it this speech is actually on the<br>record<br>um all talks we do really are but in<br>this sense there's there is a printed<br>form<br>so should you fall asleep or go and get<br>coffee<br>you can go and read it afterwards and in<br>that speech<br>it's also got diagrams and pictures<br>which i know economists are very excited<br>about<br>graphs and tables um all of those<br>key things that we live and breathe from<br>and<br>and make a living from so in a sense you<br>know<br>in the beginning um through 2019<br>um certainly late 2019 the world began<br>watching this covert 19 virus<br>uh unfold from a local through to a<br>global pandemic<br>and we were all watching particularly<br>decision makers who were faced global<br>decision makers with this<br>horrible choice of whether to<br>intervene directly potentially<br>threatening lifestyles livelihoods to<br>contain social movement<br>or to whether let this thing run its<br>course and try and continue<br>lifestyles and livelihoods as it was and<br>that choice<br>was very rapidly resolved for<br>policymakers not by them but for them<br>by the fact that global hospital systems<br>were<br>very very rapidly overrun<br>and hence inaction was not a policy<br>option<br>and immediate action was taken almost<br>instantaneously across the globe showing<br>how globally connected we were<br>and that in itself has become what you'd<br>call these constraints on social<br>mobility<br>and that constraint on social mobility<br>has been the number one constraint on<br>uh economic life as we knew it prior to<br>the covert 19<br>virus in new zealand and at tpu tmr2<br>the reserve bank yes we were also<br>watching as well<br>along with the rest of the world and<br>watching how<br>the response to the virus or how the<br>virus itself was spreading and now the<br>policy responses were leading from a<br>health issue<br>to a pending economic crunch<br>it was as always<br>a very unique period one of the<br>wonderful sayings and i see<br>leo and iris here who have sent through<br>many monetary policy committees<br>times were more unusual than usual um<br>almost every monetary policy committee<br>started with people saying times are<br>more unusual than usual so<br>we kind of almost had the you know<br>finally some actual evidence<br>it was uh the good news for the citizens<br>of rt aurora and certainly the members<br>of tipu tmi2<br>the reserve bank was that we ourselves<br>had<br>been preparing for a long time not just<br>watching worrying and waiting we were<br>also<br>doing somahi working the fourth w there<br>um around preparing new zealand to<br>increase its financial resilience its<br>financial stability and again vitoria<br>touched on a few of those issues<br>most of those things like humans do we<br>were busy<br>creating taking lessons from the<br>previous war to try and fight the<br>current one<br>and the previous economic challenge was<br>the global financial crisis and all of<br>the factors that unfolded from that<br>very different situations around how it<br>started what it meant where it was<br>centered et cetera<br>but we were still working through that<br>and fortunately a lot of the work<br>that we were had either finished or were<br>in train or putting into place<br>has proved very useful you know that<br>resilience<br>was working across bank capital bank<br>risk management<br>liquidity management governance<br>conduct and culture within the banking<br>sector the ability to make the financial<br>system more resilient through time to<br>economic shocks is that resilience<br>word again our work also was<br>on how do you operate monetary policy in<br>this<br>extremely low and persistently low<br>inflation and hence low<br>nominal and low real interest rates<br>because what that meant was that central<br>bank's policy<br>tools the traditional tool the price<br>tool of the<br>short-term interest rate that can impact<br>somewhere along the yield curve i<br>might understand leo and irish are going<br>to tell us how far it can impact<br>later this afternoon but we are working<br>on<br>additional monetary policy tools i use<br>the word additional because they started<br>off as a working paper on unconventional<br>then they became alternative<br>and now i would say they are mainstream<br>monetary policy tools<br>for central banks globally and so that<br>proved to be extremely timely we were<br>always doing it in preparedness<br>um a negative or a zero ocr<br>flaw was was well within an 80<br>confidence interval<br>and hence we thought given our<br>forecasting and accuracies<br>um that that was probably well within<br>our chance of hitting it<br>um this was from in 2019 we didn't<br>expect to have to be using them<br>so quickly which was early 2020<br>but we were in good stead we'd put out<br>the working paper we'd<br>got people through the first part shock<br>horror denial<br>and eventually acceptance came through<br>and we're doing a lot of other<br>activities some which proved incredibly<br>precedent<br>prescient um uh by the fact that you've<br>never heard of them<br>we were swapping out and putting in a<br>superior<br>payment and settlement systems inside<br>the bank as well<br>it was a 30-year plus real-time gross<br>settlement system we bank the bank since<br>they call us a central bank<br>and those payment settlement systems if<br>they can't handle the volume<br>um it's you the public of new zealand<br>who find out first<br>when the computer says no when you try<br>and get your cash out or make a<br>transaction<br>within weeks that was the new system was<br>tested<br>extremely well because of the rush to<br>cash<br>and the unusual flows etc that we saw<br>going on<br>so um and the very last part was this<br>this wonderful<br>had been mysterious but we want to take<br>the veil away<br>and make it far more publicly obvious as<br>this council of financial regulators<br>so the reserve bank of one of its roles<br>is is obviously the prudential regulator<br>of<br>of deposit taking institutions and um<br>and um<br>insurance um and we've been getting<br>together with other regulators to make<br>sure that we<br>are aligned in what we're doing that we<br>weren't hitting the industry<br>at the same time on a vast amount of<br>issues or we weren't turning up for the<br>third time in a row asking the same<br>question from the last regulator<br>and so that has been a real challenge<br>and that is coming together<br>in fact we had a one of our quarterly<br>meetings only yesterday<br>and there you know we're really anchored<br>on<br>core strategic themes that collectively<br>we can work on<br>show leadership on and bring in um<br>uh the private sector non-government<br>organizations academics economists<br>around these longer-term<br>challenges that face um rtri new zealand<br>and the globe<br>so you will hear more of that<br>i will say that payment and settlement<br>systems and financial inclusion um sorry<br>uh remittance stories as just mentioned<br>are one of the core types of collective<br>activities we're doing<br>where regulations don't end up with<br>unintended consequences of countries<br>not being able to access um the means of<br>living<br>so our preparedness efforts certainly<br>proved timely<br>i won't say it was predicted it was just<br>timely that we had been doing all of<br>this work<br>and that in a sense is our kaitiaki our<br>care caretaker role of new zealand's<br>financial system so that's what you<br>would hope and anticipate<br>from the bank um this is where uh<br>i eat significant humble pie because i<br>would say we were<br>far from alone in preparing for<br>such economic challenges and<br>in delivering some of the policy results<br>that we've seen<br>at best i would say we were a part<br>player<br>but perhaps you know you know a<br>reasonable<br>co-lead or something but we were far<br>from the lead actor<br>in the response to the covet 19. the<br>first<br>significant importance of of getting us<br>where we are<br>today and we'll talk about the future of<br>courses is the platform that had been<br>laid<br>over many decades in new zealand through<br>economic policy<br>the low level of government debt has<br>given us plenty of fiscal<br>head room flexibility optionality that<br>hasn't existed<br>doesn't exist in many countries and so<br>we're able to use that money for the<br>rainy day<br>if it was a rainy day it looked like<br>this covert 19 challenge<br>we were fortunate to be in a favorable<br>terms of trade position that was<br>probably more fortunate than planned<br>in fact you know the terms of trade has<br>been one of the most surprising<br>outcomes for rtro new zealand through<br>this crisis traditionally<br>if you're seeing economic activity<br>globally come to a halt<br>generally global commodity prices come<br>to a halt and new zealand's terms of<br>trade gets<br>seriously impacted that hasn't been the<br>case this time<br>you know being told to go home stay home<br>means we can couch surf<br>so things that you can click and use<br>have done extremely well in market<br>capitalization<br>big tech and we like to consume and we<br>are a key supplier of consumption goods<br>to the world so once we got through some<br>of the supply chain issues<br>our terms of trade have held up very<br>well and i was pleased to come<br>to uh to the waikato um after<br>yesterday's<br>dairy announcement i see that prices are<br>still holding up incredibly strong<br>and so there was a a significant suite<br>that had put us<br>in good stead us being the the economy<br>of new zealand<br>but um you know you stand you<br>are listening to a proud governor of the<br>central bank and proud that we are able<br>to contribute<br>as we did we eased monetary conditions<br>as victoria just mentioned we took the<br>ocr<br>as low as we could go without going to<br>zero<br>or negative we committed we would keep<br>it there<br>for the 12 months for the foreseeable<br>future we committed to that because we<br>were also building additional tools<br>and we wanted to understand whether<br>those additional tools needed to be<br>deployed and whether they were<br>relatively better or not than an<br>official cash rate at zero or negative<br>and so we were able to understand<br>against<br>pre-preset criteria and then through<br>time<br>deploy these new monetary tools<br>the large-scale asset purchase which<br>i'll come back to<br>the funding for lending program you know<br>this work that<br>we have been able to get the interest<br>rates by households and businesses in<br>new zealand<br>as low as necessary to continue to<br>achieve<br>the reserve bank's mandate uh we<br>introduced an enormous amount of<br>liquidity facilities<br>uh sorry uh continuously referring to<br>the previous speech by the way we didn't<br>practice this<br>before we came i just want to put that<br>on the record but<br>if we had it wouldn't have been as good<br>as it turned out from<br>victoria but the liquidity facilities<br>meant that cash was<br>plenty full cheap and available to the<br>banking sector<br>and that our financial markets continue<br>to work<br>in a very highly liquid way we ensured<br>public had continued access to cash<br>as has been through all previous crises<br>the first thing that humans do<br>is is think about their own personal<br>security<br>and they seek safety in cash<br>so we saw this enormous outflow of cash<br>from from our vault<br>s small s and<br>and that all went into the households<br>we're only just starting to see it<br>dribble back now so when people say<br>we're in a cashless society no we're not<br>we're in a less cash society people<br>still<br>always seek safety<br>in that side and we were able to assist<br>the government<br>government uh particularly with strong<br>relationships with treasury<br>in a real in a real-time manner um the<br>mortgage deferral schemes the business<br>financing guarantee schemes<br>and and the data instruments programs<br>and i've mentioned the reprioritization<br>of our regulatory<br>issues so they were fantastic but it was<br>successful not just because uh you know<br>getting<br>these things in place and and<br>keeping the shop open at least to have<br>another go<br>from here on forward in large part<br>because of our connectedness<br>to the industry and particularly the<br>banking industry<br>understanding their operational<br>resilience understanding the liquidity<br>criteria the risks that they were<br>holding understanding what<br>what tools would and wouldn't work for<br>them<br>was and very very useful and there were<br>some<br>lovely constructive achievement focused<br>conversations<br>which we wrote in hindsight but it was<br>tough going to be able to get these<br>types of issues in place<br>and i've mentioned often in other<br>speeches you can take the horse to the<br>water but you can't get them to drink<br>some of these tools have worked merely<br>by the fact that they are<br>available even if they aren't being used<br>and i'd say a funding for lending<br>program where banks can come to our<br>window for their wholesale<br>funding as opposed to relying on<br>deposits or international<br>wholesale markets even if it hasn't been<br>tapped much to date the mere fact it is<br>available at that threat of competition<br>is creating the behaviors that we want<br>to see<br>on the way through so that is in a sense<br>a great outcome<br>and that is the mahitahi story they're<br>working together<br>recognizing that no one institution no<br>one sector of society<br>can achieve all of this we have to work<br>collectively on the way through<br>and if we can keep that spirit going<br>here in rtro<br>new zealand um you know bottle that<br>lesson<br>it will be a fantastic and strong<br>momentum going forward<br>this is where i put the warning out<br>those<br>who don't like work should leave the<br>room now because towards the end of the<br>speech i'm going to plead that you help<br>and work with us<br>around one of our challenges in that<br>mahitahi spirit going forward<br>the ability for the economy to maintain<br>the current economic<br>economic momentum is always going to be<br>first and foremost a function of the<br>health outcomes as we go through this<br>global vaccination<br>challenge that is in the short term<br>there is no bigger variable that is<br>going to determine economic outcomes<br>than the health outcome<br>and the policy responses to the health<br>outcome<br>the opening line of the speech<br>originally said it was so great to be<br>here in a broad collective audience of<br>all new zealand<br>economists economic association and<br>obviously even<br>between last week when i was writing<br>this and today when i'm delivering it<br>we're not that shows how uncertain the<br>environment is that we're working in<br>so you know that's the number one health<br>outcome but<br>the more medium term it's really going<br>to come down to<br>i would say confidence in households and<br>especially confidence in businesses<br>to invest to adapt to go back to i won't<br>say<br>business as usual because we won't see<br>that but go back to<br>long-term business planning long-term<br>investment<br>the current pickup has been has been<br>strongly supported<br>by some significant one-off events<br>some of those i hope do not have to be<br>repeated<br>the most significant event was of course<br>the balance sheet<br>deck chair swapping that we did from the<br>government's balance sheet into the<br>private sector and household balance<br>sheet through wage subsidies mortgage<br>deferrals<br>business financing guarantee schemes in<br>particular that wage subsidy was<br>amazingly powerful<br>at giving people i wouldn't say the<br>confidence to continue to employ people<br>i would say the capability to that<br>there was a cash flow to keep people<br>connected to the labor force<br>you can't keep doing that um unless you<br>want to call yourself<br>the soviet union in 1922 or something<br>you know that is a policy for<br>extraordinary times<br>and and uh i really hope we don't<br>go back to extraordinary times uh there<br>is going to be a long leg now there the<br>global vaccine<br>roll out is fantastic news it means that<br>the horizon is is now you know we can<br>now see the horizon<br>towards the end of this current um<br>pandemic issue but the horizon is still<br>some way off<br>and it's going to be a long period<br>before sufficient<br>immunity global immunity is there and<br>before we<br>turn back to as whatever the new normal<br>looks like in economic activity<br>given that ongoing economic uncertainty<br>given that nervousness around business<br>investment<br>given how low inflation has been<br>and how employment remains<br>away from its maximum sustainable type<br>estimates<br>and this is why monetary policy remains<br>very symmetry and we made that very<br>clear<br>as recently as last week with our<br>monetary policy statement the monetary<br>policy committee remains focused on<br>inflation and contributing to maximum<br>sustainable employment<br>and to achieve our mandate we still need<br>stimulatory<br>monetary conditions i will come to<br>to the challenges that means elsewhere<br>in fact i'll do that now because as we<br>all know aggregate economic statistics<br>as exciting as they are we used to laugh<br>that if your feet are on fire and your<br>head's in the fridge on average your<br>economics the monetary policy is a very<br>blunt tool<br>and aggregate statistics hide mask a<br>huge difference across<br>individuals sectors demographics<br>around um how we're feeling<br>about it the challenges that came<br>through<br>um were many um you know the<br>secular decline in nominal and real<br>interest rates<br>up until just recent days has meant<br>that our traditional tools weren't there<br>anymore and we've had to produce<br>additional tools it meant that<br>the pace and magnitude of the economic<br>shock<br>the working together between government<br>and<br>and the private sector reached unique<br>high levels in fact i would say we<br>outsourced a lot of our policy<br>implementation<br>to banks to financial intermediaries<br>whether that was mortgage deferrals<br>whether that was the deployment of wage<br>subsidies<br>you know that was a high trust in the<br>moment challenge<br>very different to what we consider<br>fiscal policy normally being<br>how effective was that i would say<br>globally it was<br>quite timely and effective i'd say here<br>in new zealand it was very timely<br>and highly effective in what we achieved<br>yes we talk about the residuals and they<br>are important and they are lingering and<br>ongoing<br>but for the there and now during the<br>crisis the ability to<br>to cash flow and create the confidence<br>to get us<br>through the first wave of the pandemic<br>i think also it's really important<br>particularly for the central bank we're<br>always about<br>making sure people understand our<br>mandate making sure people understand<br>our operational independence<br>a lot of discussion because of the<br>additional alternative monetary policy<br>tools were there<br>had people confused around<br>large-scale asset purchases<br>driven by the monetary policy committee<br>to achieve lower interest rates<br>and money financing the government's<br>fiscal policy<br>and so just to make that clear while<br>they are subtle<br>they they appear very subtle in their<br>differences from outside they are<br>significantly different<br>in terms of institutional structures and<br>the outcomes are after<br>the government's debt issuance through<br>this period has been driven<br>purely by their desires<br>needs wants around government spending<br>and government investment<br>determining the bond issuance program<br>that is a fiscal policy decision<br>utterly outside of any of the reserve<br>banks mandate or line of sight<br>we receive this information at the same<br>time<br>the rest of the country receives it<br>under the bank's large-scale asset<br>purchasing program though this is where<br>we were buying<br>government bonds we were taking an asset<br>releasing cash into the banking sector<br>that the amount and timing of our<br>government bond purchase was driven<br>purely for our monetary policy<br>committee's purposes<br>to achieve low and stable inflation and<br>contribute to maximum sustainable<br>employment<br>we bought those to lower interest rates<br>and<br>flatten the yield curve as far as was<br>possible<br>and necessary to achieve our employment<br>inflation and those decisions were hours<br>and hours alone around the monetary<br>policy<br>we were actually when we were doing the<br>research in the background around well<br>what if we did a large scale asset<br>purchase what would we actually buy<br>and i if you go back to one of the<br>papers we published in late 2019 our<br>number one concern was there aren't<br>enough assets out there to actually buy<br>of sufficient quality<br>and quantity um well that was quite<br>quickly resolved<br>by the government's debt issuances so we<br>we ourselves have forgotten about the<br>endogenous<br>of these things if and when we use it<br>and of course<br>the financial implications of the<br>reserve bank's balance sheet increasing<br>as we take these assets on<br>and swap it out for cash has been<br>in a sense indemnified through crown<br>indemnities<br>you know the reserve bank's balance<br>sheet it just sits on the whole crown<br>balance sheet<br>um the fact that we're holding um you<br>know the mark to market challenge around<br>that bond we've received indemnities<br>so that the monetary policy committee<br>remains able<br>capable resourced to make the decisions<br>it needs<br>to continue to reach its operational<br>independence<br>in a perfect world when the bank would<br>have had sufficient capital not to have<br>to go through<br>that indemnity process and that is<br>something that we'll be working on on<br>the way through<br>as well so i hope that helps people<br>separate it looks like the same from the<br>outside<br>but what went inside i use the sausage<br>analysis what what actually went on the<br>inside is incredibly different<br>the central bank remains operationally<br>independent as does<br>fiscal policy is driven by their needs<br>their wants<br>so that was a paid advert for<br>operational independence of central<br>banks<br>the fact is uh you know why were we<br>so eager to ease monetary policy<br>as quickly as we did suffice to say it<br>should be obvious<br>because we have a mandate to achieve our<br>inflation<br>and our employment targets low and<br>stable inflation somewhere between one<br>to three percent per annum on the<br>consumer price index<br>not the house price index and that was<br>our<br>actions that we're doing it like many<br>central banks around the world because<br>of this very low global inflation<br>uh actual inflation new zealand has been<br>bouncing around at the bottom end of<br>that inflation target and at times<br>even outside of it at the bottom end and<br>so we were<br>very keen to head off embedding<br>extremely low inflation and risking<br>deflation<br>likewise unemployment or employment you<br>know that's real it's not some notional<br>concept of the average consumer<br>we know that if you are temporarily out<br>of the labor market that's a good<br>indication that you might be more<br>permanently out of the labor market<br>so making sure that we were contributing<br>to people remaining in<br>jobs through this process was the key<br>driver of our monetary policy actions<br>with all of that i will come to the<br>original<br>but but monetary policy<br>is a blunt tool uh you know we are<br>talking about aggregate<br>inflation we're talking about uh<br>unemployment<br>across the economy or maximum<br>sustainable employment<br>we know that the impact of monetary<br>policy will always<br>and forever have different impacts on<br>wealth<br>and income equality through time<br>on sectors of society there might be<br>savers versus investors old versus<br>young importers versus exporters you can<br>cut and dice it in many ways<br>it is a blunt tool i do want to say that<br>the literature to date our best efforts<br>and this is our first paid advertisement<br>for work<br>suggests that very low nominal<br>interest rates and very low real<br>interest rates the research shows it's<br>unclear whether that actually<br>increases or decreases wealth and income<br>equality<br>it becomes an empirical matter not a<br>theoretical matter<br>around that equality issue<br>and so um as usual and i'm pleased<br>victoria has just<br>offered her entire balance sheet to all<br>economists in new zealand i think that's<br>what i heard wasn't it<br>perhaps not the balance sheet but at<br>least some good data<br>to really climb into that equality issue<br>and and work around under what kind of<br>circumstances<br>and what situations do you need to how<br>to understand what these<br>um equality impacts on income and wealth<br>really do come from um from monetary<br>policy decisions<br>without doubt though of course one of<br>the main challenges of monetary policy<br>well it's not even a main channel one<br>channel of monetary policy is<br>is through lower interest rates uh<br>helping to<br>inflate asset prices uh those who own<br>those assets suddenly feel wealthier<br>they feel more inclined to spend their<br>spending<br>increases economic activity increases<br>employment and and we get that wonderful<br>wonderful short-term sense of a monetary<br>policy shot to the arm<br>and so without doubt uh monetary policy<br>and interest rates have an impact on<br>asset prices<br>we're aware of that we've talked about<br>that forever it's no surprise<br>um and we've seen that what i would like<br>to remind audiences<br>obviously probably more those who are<br>reading it outside of the<br>association of economists but this is a<br>through history and a global phenomenon<br>it is not unique or specific to new<br>zealand right here right now<br>this is often how monetary policy roles<br>you've seen that in global equity<br>markets<br>the number one challenge in global<br>equity markets is others are they<br>sniffing through real<br>real long-term economic returns do the<br>current market capitalizations reflect<br>their underlying earnings expected<br>earnings<br>or are they because the risk return<br>curve the securities line has been<br>crushed to zero and flattened and it's<br>simply a short-term<br>sugar hit to two countries and that<br>means<br>it's very different implications once<br>interest rates<br>start to rise or monetary policy can<br>renormalize what does that mean for<br>asset values around house prices are<br>included in those assets and of course<br>house<br>houses and house ownership in new<br>zealand is<br>that key asset for households<br>in new zealand and more so than i<br>perhaps in any other oecd country i<br>always stand to be corrected on steps<br>but<br>it is widely held in new zealand home<br>ownership and it makes up over two<br>thirds of household wealth as as best we<br>can manage it so it is a<br>significant asset and asset price<br>changes really impact economic activity<br>in tehran so you know that<br>is um very clear um<br>while it's wonderful for me to say look<br>of course we expected this oh my god<br>really you know get over it understand<br>that<br>that's not what i'm saying i'm saying<br>it's critical that we the reserve bank<br>of new zealand<br>understand those relative impacts that<br>monetary policy can have<br>shout from the rooftops around that what<br>it is<br>and talk to policy makers and other<br>parts of our own bank<br>around those implications of of wealth<br>equality<br>income equality what those implications<br>are<br>many of the longer term policy issues<br>and certainly instruments are outside of<br>the reserve bank<br>but we do have both sides you know we<br>have both monetary policy<br>and financial stability um so<br>so that is the action sorry can i just<br>how much have i got it would be great if<br>you could wrap up so we've got a bit of<br>time for questions<br>oh okay well my job was to speak right<br>through so i got no questions<br>we've got some great questions coming i<br>think you're confused i'm from the<br>reserve bank<br>um so i will speed through them because<br>as i said you can go and see the movie<br>afterwards i'm just reading the book out<br>loud to you<br>um really cutting to the chase on<br>housing<br>uh we have received in fact i'm going to<br>put this put this aside look at that i'm<br>over the stuff this is where i make<br>markets accidentally move because i say<br>something that wasn't in the speech<br>but um that work<br>on housing asset prices income<br>equality inequality is incredibly<br>important to us and it's a<br>place where we have recently received as<br>recent as last week<br>a new directive from the government<br>and it's a directive down the financial<br>policy arm<br>of our business not the monetary policy<br>not the monetary policy committee<br>agreement<br>but through the financial stability<br>remit section 68 of the act<br>and section 68b you always find out<br>these things when you have to go and<br>search it for the first time ever<br>because someone's asked you about it<br>says that we should have regard<br>to house prices when setting<br>our financial stability<br>policies our financial stability<br>policies are largely related to the loan<br>to value ratios<br>are related to bank capital bank lending<br>policy<br>it's all around the financial stability<br>issue<br>now we have always had regard to house<br>prices when<br>setting monetary policy i've talked<br>about the one channel already the wealth<br>channel<br>incredibly important to get a sense on<br>where the economy is going and hence<br>what we might need to be doing with<br>monetary<br>policy stimulation but likewise all<br>things related to housing<br>are included in the consumer price index<br>rentals<br>maintenance rates in fact they make up<br>around one quarter of the consumer price<br>index<br>so again they impact directly on it and<br>of course<br>the ratio you know the relative buying a<br>house versus building one<br>is an important question mark around<br>whether we see increased building<br>activity so on the monetary policy side<br>we've got a good handle on on how<br>housing impacts on spanning activity<br>and measured inflation and that is for<br>all to see and has always been there<br>on the financial stability side where we<br>have to think hard<br>is around given the importance of<br>housing uh house prices as the asset<br>class and hence<br>financial exposure how does house price<br>variability<br>impact on financial stability the good<br>news for banks is that they don't just<br>have the one house they have a portfolio<br>of homes<br>and so the stress testing you just heard<br>from around victoria<br>it's about how does that portfolio of<br>homes behave dependent on particular<br>idiosyncratic shocks<br>and it's very hard to upset a lending<br>bank a well-diversified banks balance<br>sheet<br>through house price variability but it's<br>very easy to upset<br>a household's financial variability<br>because they might only have the one<br>so our work is to say with a focus on<br>that holistic<br>financial stability role how do we have<br>regard to house prices in there<br>and in particular a word called<br>sustainable house prices<br>we need to do work around what do we<br>mean by sustainable house prices<br>what instruments would we have that may<br>be able to<br>impact on house prices and nudge them<br>towards something that we consider<br>sustainable<br>and what instruments don't we have<br>either that we could have<br>deposit to income um a debt to income<br>ratios for example<br>or that other government agencies should<br>be working on<br>that keep the housing market more<br>sustainable<br>so our work ahead will be around looking<br>at housing from<br>both the investor perspective and<br>the occupier perspective from the<br>occupant perspective you know this is<br>the person actually wants to live in the<br>house<br>that strange person as opposed to the<br>ones we hear about too often the<br>investor who wants to create a portfolio<br>of homes<br>to live in a home you're making these<br>economic trade-offs between<br>rent versus mortgage servicing the fact<br>that you'll own the house at the end if<br>you actually have a mortgage<br>enhance the expected capital gain versus<br>putting your money somewhere else<br>renting and investing everywhere else so<br>you know i think we can boil it down to<br>some some sensible aggregate type of<br>statistics of course that's the economic<br>rationale<br>there's the whole other societal issues<br>around wanting to belong to a community<br>etc<br>so those are broader issues around that<br>we have<br>and on the investor side you know a<br>sense around what does an optimal<br>portfolio allocation suggest that<br>that you might actually have as a<br>household and exposure to<br>all things residential investment<br>given current settings policy settings<br>and if those policy settings suggest<br>that you are continuously overweight<br>housing and investors only<br>and always incentivized to hold more<br>houses well then are we comfortable with<br>those settings<br>are they settings that the reserve bank<br>might actually have or are they policy<br>settings<br>elsewhere so we're going to play our<br>role and as usual it's only a bit role<br>in the whole concept of housing because<br>as we pointed out in<br>our letter sharing with the minister of<br>finance there<br>is a vast array of<br>policy institutions private sector<br>institutions non-government<br>organizations who<br>play important parts of housing supply<br>and housing demand we'll think hard on<br>the demand side<br>we're only a bit player we will be<br>highly transparent we will shout from<br>the rooftops around how we're thinking<br>about it<br>our number one nervousness right here<br>right today<br>was around the very high risk lending<br>the high<br>debt lending in particular to investors<br>because they are the ones who can most<br>trigger house price<br>variability it's much easier to enter<br>and exit a home<br>as an owner if you're not also the<br>dweller and so it's these price<br>variables<br>this isn't a bash on the investors the<br>investors play important equilibrium<br>parts of the market and this is about<br>current homes it's not about building<br>new homes<br>and this is why we put our our loan to<br>value restrictions back on most recently<br>so in the end martini mamano karapati<br>many hands make light work help please<br>we're up for it we've got our work ahead<br>of us we've started<br>but we are far from a monopoly on wisdom<br>yeah you stay there if you like and i'll<br>just grab this ipad sorry i'll grab this<br>ipad and go<br>go behind you well you did try to use up<br>all of the time and i could see the<br>strategy<br>but don't worry wms is not to be<br>outbeated on this i've just got approval<br>that we can go a little bit into morning<br>tea<br>time so you didn't take notice of that<br>in the program did you<br>ask me first of all i'd like to open it<br>right okay no we we have we have a lot<br>of<br>you know a lot of the questions that<br>have been coming through from our online<br>audience<br>are about risk we understand you know<br>everybody understands the benefits of<br>economic policy and<br>the changes and settings that have been<br>needed but let me start with the first<br>one because the<br>most of them seem to be about risks<br>whether to new zealand or<br>other countries and of course there's<br>that trade-off every time you have an<br>economic policy there's a risk<br>associated with it<br>so adrian how concerned should we be<br>about huge asset price increases<br>due to low interest rates how do we<br>balance the possible boost to economic<br>growth<br>with systemic risks yeah i you know i<br>think the answer should be<br>always and everywhere very worried you<br>know returns do not come free it returns<br>uh a reward for taking on risk you must<br>understand those risks you must be<br>able to manage those risks and<br>at times that is not how those risks<br>have been allocated<br>i think about financial stability when<br>all relevant financial risks have<br>been adequately identified you know are<br>we sure of this market credit liquidity<br>whatever the various risks are that the<br>terminology might use<br>uh have they been priced appropriately<br>and and there are periods where pricing<br>is significantly off-piste and have they<br>been through that pricing allocated to<br>people<br>who are best able to management manage<br>it and often that is not the case it's<br>allocated to<br>a household that may have not even<br>identified let alone price that risk<br>so you know in short big question marks<br>around global<br>equity prices relative to underlying<br>earnings<br>and absolutely a question mark around<br>house prices globally and an rtro in new<br>zealand<br>relative to household earnings and so<br>take that on board and i would say the<br>number one<br>way in which a lot of this risk ends up<br>being highly concentrated in housing in<br>new zealand<br>is the ability to leverage that asset<br>compared to<br>other investments the fact that we can<br>turn up with a 20<br>deposit and get a five to one leverage<br>um that just seems a no-brainer to<br>everyone but<br>leverage is a significant risk<br>thanks very much adrian and a kind of<br>associated question i know you spoke a<br>lot about<br>housing at the end of your presentation<br>there but we've got a question<br>um here you know how are you going to<br>approach this mandate<br>to to housing how your approach they're<br>calling a new one you you remind us it's<br>not necessarily completely new but how<br>are you<br>yeah i mean the key thing i wanted to<br>remind first and foremost was that when<br>it was announced<br>it was conflated with the monetary<br>policy committee mandate<br>um yes that committee mandate has<br>changed but at the margin it was about<br>us saying<br>we have to translate the impact as best<br>we can assess of<br>our interest rate decision our monetary<br>policy decision i should say<br>on the government's housing goals so be<br>transparent about it<br>and that is a positive thing because<br>that's how we roll anyway<br>but it's around the financial stability<br>remit it has always allowed an<br>opportunity for a minister<br>to talk about things we have regard to<br>we can say we had regard to that and<br>we're going to not do anything<br>because it doesn't fit with our<br>overarching mandate the financial<br>stability<br>but this does you know the fact that<br>variability in asset prices<br>over inflated asset prices and house<br>prices amongst that<br>fit into our financial stability mandate<br>we will be looking very<br>hard around uh behaviour demand<br>management behavior around how far<br>our prices from some sense of fair value<br>what that may mean for financial<br>vulnerability<br>and what our instruments may actually be<br>able to do to at least<br>nudge those prices back towards some<br>sense of fair value<br>with that asset class so you know we<br>know our instruments are only going to<br>be partial<br>but we might as well have you know the<br>jib cut to ensure<br>that we are acting as a stabilizer<br>rather than a destabilizer with our<br>financial<br>policy settings yeah and of course it's<br>one of the frustrations to economists<br>and particularly macroeconomists that we<br>don't have those sharp instruments<br>um that we would like so you're using<br>fairly blunt instruments to try<br>to achieve these um these objectives you<br>know i'm very pleased we don't have<br>sharp instruments because<br>i know my staff and i'm sure i trust<br>them with it but the um<br>and of course economics is all about<br>relative so<br>the blunt instruments are what they are<br>i'd say the number one frustration<br>uh here and across many countries is<br>is truly being able to explain what the<br>key drivers are<br>and getting the people who control those<br>key drivers to have concern or regard to<br>those<br>through time intergenerationally not<br>just short term<br>and i'd say that's around the banks you<br>know it was great hearing from<br>victoria she said more data more working<br>together that's fantastic but how about<br>a longer term horizon<br>as well for um ceos of private sector<br>companies rather than just being driven<br>to short-term<br>profit long-term sustainable profits<br>would<br>fundamentally change thinking around<br>around business practices<br>and i think that is important to have a<br>wide range of stakeholders it's<br>interesting when i've been talking with<br>some of you guys in the audience<br>you've been a bit apologetic that<br>sometimes your economics isn't you know<br>you haven't studied economics but<br>actually it impacts all of us<br>and i think we all need to come to the<br>party so please don't be scared of<br>bringing up your questions<br>there's no stupid questions in uh<br>economics and in fact sometimes the most<br>um challenging questions<br>come from people that might not<br>understand the things that we've been<br>brainwashed into accepting adrian can i<br>take you up you haven't quite escaped<br>yet<br>can i take you up to a little bit of<br>international risk we've got a question<br>from<br>from online about the the latest<br>proposed us stimulus package which is<br>absolutely huge if that comes to pass<br>is the world heading towards an<br>inflation problem<br>uh you know we always put that word<br>problem at the end are we heading back<br>to having<br>low in state and sustainable inflation<br>as opposed to fears of zero nominal<br>bounds and deflation<br>and that is a single biggest policy<br>question now<br>we have to liberate ourselves from the<br>fact we happen to have had our working<br>careers since the 1970s and through<br>sorry insulting some of you in the room<br>um<br>you know high stagflation higher<br>variable inflation that is not the world<br>we live in now<br>i mean it's a world that we want to<br>avoid going back to absolutely critical<br>but the single biggest challenge in the<br>world at the moment is rapidly falling<br>places deflation<br>and dislocation in labor markets so<br>you know the first and foremost around<br>the world central banks is let's try and<br>overachieve<br>on our inflation targets because this<br>fear of the previous problem<br>has led to us underachieving for so long<br>and so you know<br>from from jay powell through to almost<br>every central bank in the world they now<br>talk about and it's very complicated<br>ways about<br>risking overshooting their inflation<br>targets so that at least on average<br>they're broadly right because at the<br>moment they have<br>well undershot the fiscal policy i would<br>say the biggest concern around<br>fiscal policy which is why we ended up<br>with independent monetary policy<br>working aggregate demand is that it is<br>slow to get moving and it's very often<br>not temporary<br>it's not an ideal tool for for cyclical<br>demand management<br>and you know a nervousness that would be<br>out there in the markets was<br>has too much arrived too late around<br>fiscal stimulus<br>and you know we'll see um that is that<br>is<br>i i don't believe that um because i have<br>no idea<br>um but you know that is where the<br>markets for example at the moment are<br>sniffing to say wow<br>is this massive package is this arriving<br>at the time you know<br>about 12 months behind the game that's<br>why i'm so pleased why put<br>very effective in the new zealand<br>self-marking<br>exam paper around fiscal policy<br>rather than quite effective the<br>timeliness was incredibly important<br>interesting comment there wasn't<br>over-performing in inflation isn't such<br>a bad thing when we're facing negative<br>interest rates and and that was i guess<br>my my comment earlier about<br>living in japan you're facing policies<br>that aren't normally the ones that we<br>might think were great economic policies<br>and remember<br>have to remember japan has some lessons<br>but not that many japan was wealthy<br>enough to live with declining<br>populations<br>staying alive by eating into large<br>savings and incomes that is not the case<br>for most oecd countries we would go into<br>deflation with very high debt<br>and an extreme need for nominal cash<br>flow<br>and deflation is not that environment<br>and let's follow on on the debt issue<br>adrian because of of course we've had a<br>number of questions coming through on<br>this<br>what's your view on whether we can<br>simply write off debt<br>some other countries seem to be adopting<br>a print more and never pay it back<br>approach<br>well i would strongly disagree with that<br>second statement print more and write it<br>off<br>um you know outside of venezuela<br>argentina and<br>possibly zimbabwe the rest of the world<br>is saying<br>to the fact that they are quantitative<br>easing they central banks are buying<br>assets and putting those assets on their<br>balance sheet<br>they only remain assets if they are<br>worth something not if they are written<br>off<br>and that was why i made that important<br>distinction i really do hope that<br>economists give me that name of that<br>person understand<br>that difference because<br>we are buying bonds in the secondary<br>market they are assets on our balance<br>sheet we are not simply money financing<br>fiscal<br>policy money financing fiscal policy is<br>possible<br>but it comes with a whole different<br>series of institutional structures<br>and unique risks it was anonymous<br>that's a good thing about slider but<br>anyone in a room who uh can't<br>necessarily you can cover<br>your face with your program or something<br>if you like but would anyone like to um<br>just for the people online what sort of<br>levels of overshooting of inflation<br>would the reserve bank be comfortable<br>with was the question<br>grant yep thanks adrian<br>would you be able to expand a little bit<br>on the<br>term sustainable house prices does that<br>mean sustaining them at a 20<br>growth rate per year or sustaining the<br>absolute level<br>um what what do you think what is your<br>thinking<br>about the whole notion of sustainability<br>of house prices which seems a bit vague<br>at this stage<br>thank you grant um and no not at twenty<br>percent per annum and you know that<br>but nice good cheeky stuff grunt um<br>uh um uh for you it's minus 20.<br>um but for the the um<br>the idea of notion behind it is is where<br>we where our thinking will start from<br>and it will be transparent and greatly<br>assisted by wise folk around you<br>is really just underlying what would be<br>uh what drives an asset price which is<br>some kind of discounted future<br>earnings profile and hence coming out<br>with some sense of a fair value<br>a fair value of an asset price um<br>i've spent the previous 12 years with<br>the<br>new zealand super fund where that's all<br>we ever did and then we went long or<br>short depending on whether the price was<br>was below or above what we considered<br>some sense of fair value<br>why could we do that because we had<br>patients horizon and timing to be able<br>to watch<br>these prices mean revert back to some<br>sense of fair value<br>so there is always some underlying sense<br>of fair value<br>even if you're there as the investor you<br>are going to need someone to live in<br>there and someone who can pay that rent<br>and if the house price needs to justify<br>a return then<br>that's a function of the yield and if<br>the yield is the rent and the rent has<br>to keep going up and up and up<br>eventually the house is going to be<br>empty and what's going to happen to the<br>price<br>so that's the underlying concept of it<br>very easy to explain huge broad<br>measures around what would be fair value<br>what are zones of indifference around it<br>and then importantly what would be a<br>policy action<br>so for our loan to value restrictions<br>for example we might have some small but<br>positive restriction on all of the time<br>just to make sure that people have to<br>stump up and put skin in the game to<br>begin with with a deposit on their house<br>they're not over leveraged<br>but through time if it got too far away<br>we might be<br>increasing that restriction to make it<br>at the margin for an investor that they<br>have to put more skin in the game<br>more sites so that's just you know it's<br>at the margin<br>i can't tell you whether that is going<br>to be successful or not<br>at the time we only have one small part<br>business cycle where lvrs in new zealand<br>went on<br>and they did have an impact on house<br>prices but in doing that and<br>understanding fair value we're going to<br>have to<br>do a lot of work which is going to<br>unveil<br>a lot of policy settings that explain<br>why we are so heavily invested in<br>housing in new zealand not just as<br>dwellers but as an investors<br>and some of those settings are going to<br>come down to uncomfortable facts like<br>access to leverage the structure of the<br>banking sector the<br>favorability of some loans versus others<br>and taxation<br>i said it and these are only demand<br>side-setting variables<br>thanks adrian i think we've got a last<br>question there eric do you want a fairly<br>brief question please so we can um<br>sure as follow on um we remember the<br>greenspan put<br>i was a little bit worried when the<br>government was giving you a<br>more of a housing mandate that you could<br>end up with a central bank put<br>on house prices and<br>if we were able to get supply conditions<br>where they need to be there should be a<br>sharp correction in house prices<br>a lot of housing coming on stream would<br>mean like even just credible signals of<br>it<br>should sharply reduce house prices it<br>would be terrible if the reserve bank<br>saw itself as needing to lean against<br>that or worse investors<br>thinking that the bank would and<br>actually just because it's on the<br>prudential side<br>and not monetary side maybe you wouldn't<br>so just some comment on whether there's<br>a housing put we need to worry about<br>and a suggestion if you're going to be<br>watching long-term house prices<br>as part of something you need to be<br>monitoring the case shiller indices in<br>the us are wonderful<br>we don't have them here it's possible to<br>build them here but it would probably<br>take a bit of bank support because of<br>just the costs of setting up the<br>financial instruments on it<br>somebody making book on it all of the<br>thinness and expected markets there<br>hasn't really been<br>investor demand or the markets haven't<br>seen there being sufficient investor<br>demand<br>to front the cost of building the thing<br>some bank help in getting those going<br>could yield something really useful as<br>forward indicators on host prices yeah<br>yeah<br>100 agree on everything eric said more<br>data is critically needed the data is<br>not unique and what we need to create<br>will just be unique in assembling it<br>here in rtro new zealand<br>and that's you know some of the work<br>we've got i am<br>very well aware of some of the work both<br>with an asb but also other banks<br>in new zealand where they really are<br>turning to exploiting their data<br>to understand this work and they are<br>being very open with us<br>around you know making sure this is<br>anonymized uh and on the greenspan put<br>you know<br>i think the really critical thing for<br>markets to remember is this is around<br>our financial stability<br>policy tools it's not about our monetary<br>policy<br>commitment if we raise interest rates<br>today it makes housing less affordable<br>if we raise the lvr today again it does<br>the same there is<br>a time trade-off through all of this we<br>have to think through that carefully<br>i feel sorry for some of the current<br>generation<br>of people wanting to be first home<br>buyers it's going to be hard<br>kia ora thank you thank you very much<br>for that adrian<br>excellent presentation i'll let you off<br>the last question which was are you<br>going to raise interest rates this year<br>because i doubt that we were going to<br>get a very clear answer on on that one<br>but thanks very much for your insights<br>and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
