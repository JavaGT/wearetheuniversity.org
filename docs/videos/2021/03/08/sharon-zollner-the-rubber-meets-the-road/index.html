style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thanks very much it's great to be here<br>uh through an accident of availability i<br>somehow ended up<br>with the last word uh now you guys are a<br>bit of an intimidating<br>audience uh for a non-academic economist<br>and no doubt there'll be a lot in here<br>that you sort of roll your eyes a little<br>and go well we know that<br>but i've got some fun charts and<br>hopefully there's one or two you haven't<br>um<br>seen before or thought about in that way<br>but first up i should say i'm going<br>rogue<br>um i'm going to talk about how we<br>fail to evolve policy and business uh<br>for a better future<br>uh touching on some of the themes that<br>uh that iris and leo talked about<br>are we essentially setting ourselves up<br>for a bit of a rerun of some of the<br>mistakes of the past so<br>we talked a bit yesterday particularly<br>about how economics needs to change but<br>there are some<br>basic facts that we need to keep in mind<br>some truths money makes people happy<br>people like having stuff now more than<br>the next person<br>people forget stuff really quickly<br>people are sheep<br>a lot of people just spend everything<br>they have or can get<br>supply be gets demand policy makers<br>that's<br>quite relevant to the topic of the forum<br>naturally biased<br>to demonstrable or concentrated benefits<br>either hypothetical or diffused ones<br>which is why of course the government<br>even hires economists to talk about<br>those<br>hypothetical costs high debt makes you<br>vulnerable<br>a problem deferred or hidden hasn't<br>actually been solved and perhaps<br>most profoundly if something is<br>unsustainable<br>it will end so on that that's just a mix<br>of economics and<br>psychology and game theory but first up<br>let's just<br>zoom out and just take a the big picture<br>look we have had a 40-year<br>decline in nominal interest rates in new<br>zealand<br>basically since the median aged kiwi<br>was born interest rates have been lower<br>and lower and lower again<br>over that entire time now some of that<br>is structural secular as discussed<br>earlier today<br>but some of it is a decline in inflation<br>reflecting the success of inflation<br>targeting but essentially for many<br>decades we've<br>run a model of ending each business<br>cycle with<br>lower nominal rates and higher debt<br>than we had before that would seem to be<br>a running it to a natural end so as a<br>result<br>of lower interest rates everyone whether<br>you're a firm or a government or a<br>household can<br>service more debt so top left federal<br>debt in the us<br>bottom left corporate debt on the right<br>at the bottom<br>new zealand household debt that data's a<br>bit dated it's<br>no doubt higher it's at record highs<br>the covert has exacerbated the situation<br>obviously<br>um you can see households corporates<br>government all have taken on more debt<br>there we are number six<br>on that list uh big increase in<br>household debt there that's just q3<br>remember in q4 we had the strongest<br>quarterly growth in house prices<br>ever so you can imagine that has<br>probably<br>carried on not much of an increase in<br>corporate debt though<br>uh barely registers and indeed corporate<br>debt in new zealand is at very prudent<br>levels and<br>government debt is too um even at the<br>end of this we're looking at debt that's<br>lower than many countries started with<br>it's really household debt that's the<br>problem uh<br>now this is a chart that really shows<br>that as as the governor of the reserve<br>bank<br>did acknowledge monetary policy works by<br>pushing up the housing market so this is<br>google searches<br>in new zealand for how much can i borrow<br>against the one year<br>mortgage rate it's it's pretty clear uh<br>that there's a relationship there so<br>there is a lot more to house prices but<br>it's pretty clear what's uh what's<br>driven the action we've seen<br>in the last 12 months<br>uh so what's the point here that um<br>household credit growth mortgage growth<br>has gone bananas<br>um as you can see there that is this<br>pretty spectacular<br>and chris though i would really ask the<br>question here<br>do we really want or need lower mortgage<br>rates<br>from that point onwards uh the debt<br>servicing ratio looks fine of course<br>which explains why households are still<br>spending on things other than just their<br>mortgage but the servicing ratio doesn't<br>tell you about risk what we have now is<br>a<br>massive pile of debt with a very low<br>interest rate on it<br>that's nowhere near as robust as a small<br>pile of debt with a very high interest<br>rate on it<br>interest rates can change quickly debt<br>loadings not so fast<br>it also means there's a gale force<br>headwind warning<br>in auckland for example if mortgage<br>rates went up by one<br>percent that would chew up about five<br>percent of aucklanders disposable income<br>it's maybe three and the rest of new<br>zealand<br>but does show you that rising interest<br>rates are going to be<br>very very powerful in terms of a<br>handbrake<br>i think it's also valid to start asking<br>about now<br>whether monetary policy is truly<br>smoothing the business cycle if you<br>include<br>the next recession in your definition of<br>the business cycle<br>because the depth and length of<br>recessions is heavily influenced by<br>how over-leveraged people are going into<br>it<br>basically whether you're a household or<br>a government or a firmer you've got<br>you go into a bit more of a spin if<br>you've got a lot of debt and your income<br>gets<br>here interrupted the house price to<br>income ratio we've talked a bit about<br>sustainability<br>i'm not sure what that sustainable ratio<br>is but i'm concerned both about the<br>level and the rate of change of that<br>so you can see after the gfc the ratio<br>came down<br>not far off the same speed at which it<br>had gone up that's probably not<br>a bad baseline for thinking about the<br>risks of what could happen<br>when this thing turns so as interest<br>rates fall people will pay more for<br>assets because they can borrow more then<br>we have a situation where people are<br>bidding up to as much as the bank will<br>lend them<br>at auctions that's very clear which is<br>also why a first home buyer subsidy will<br>just go straight into prices<br>people also take more risk uh in the new<br>zealand context that wealth inequality<br>that house prices are causing is of<br>course an increasing<br>uh point of debate it also has financial<br>stability consequences the higher house<br>prices go<br>the more marked the direct conflict is<br>between monetary policy and financial<br>policy objectives so of course it's not<br>just houses in new zealand this is<br>this is a global issue in fact you know<br>new zealand's really a bit player here<br>we are<br>much less down this road than many other<br>countries but there for example<br>is the price to earnings ratio of the s<br>p 500<br>and people are justifying equity<br>valuation saying well the end of the<br>pandemic is nice so<br>uh earnings will improve but also well<br>i've got to be a better bet than bonds<br>for all the reasons that iris and leo<br>were talking about bonds are looking a<br>little bit<br>like a slow train wreck potentially um<br>unless<br>john's model is is right with that<br>inflation's going to<br>to fall and stay low for a very<br>prolonged period which<br>is absolutely plausible and and indeed<br>it's our forecast but it's much<br>less interesting than talking about the<br>risks that it's not the case so that's<br>what i'm going to focus on<br>also just point out that extreme<br>valuations<br>doesn't mean things will end anytime<br>soon it just means they might be quite<br>exciting when they do<br>so here's the continuation of that chart<br>i had earlier us government debt<br>this is the forecast of the<br>congressional budget office<br>and it is assuming that interest rates<br>stay low<br>this is the world's risk-free asset i<br>put risk-free asset and averted commas<br>in case you didn't hear those<br>and this is the foundation of global<br>financial markets it is the asset<br>against which the risk of everything<br>else<br>is measured i'll just<br>leave you to draw your own conclusions<br>from that chart<br>um this is a lot on the slide but<br>basically we're starting to see stories<br>that are reminiscent of 2007 we've got<br>um emperor has no clothes<br>stories we've got fund managers who have<br>prided themselves on publishing every<br>trade now mysteriously not publishing<br>them anymore we've got<br>um a spec market there's a new acronym<br>for you that's basically overpricing ipo<br>for retail investors who don't know any<br>better<br>you've got uh reddit driving uh short<br>squeezes<br>uh and of course we've got the<br>phenomenon that is that is bitcoin<br>the message here is basically when<br>people stop caring about risk you can<br>sell them all sorts of acronyms<br>um and there will be shonky behavior<br>going on<br>it's inevitable this is just the sort of<br>environment in which it happens and i<br>don't know<br>what it is or where it is but at some<br>point<br>we'll find out because risk spreads risk<br>pricing<br>um has been successfully suppressed by<br>the uh the very sharp drop in interest<br>rates that we've seen<br>the message for 20 years has been uh<br>central banks have got you back there<br>was the bernanke put the power put the<br>yellow input<br>um and and so on it goes um but i just<br>point out that the successful<br>suppression of the pricing of risk<br>is not the same thing as the elimination<br>of risk itself<br>so essentially the for example the rate<br>differential<br>uh between how the interest you have to<br>pay if you're a<br>junk bond versus an investment uh<br>company it is very small<br>relative to history and yet this doesn't<br>feel like a low risk time in the world's<br>history<br>so global central banks have actually<br>been doing everything they can<br>for about 10 years to stop financial<br>markets from doing their job of<br>allocating scarce capital efficiently<br>so obviously there's qe that's<br>definitely the mild end of the spectrum<br>and that's<br>all we've dabbled in really but the ecb<br>has crushed the french risk pricing of<br>euro<br>area bonds which is to italy's benefit<br>but uh it's a fiscal union by stealth<br>just in a pretty lumpy<br>fashion uh the ecb's buying corporate<br>bonds and equities the fed is buying<br>junk bonds so<br>if you misprice something for a long<br>time people will demand the wrong amount<br>of it i mean that's econ<br>101 and i would say risk has been<br>mispriced deliberately<br>for a very long time another consequence<br>is the rise of the zombies<br>this chart only goes up to 2014. this is<br>a bis paper<br>that basically concludes the cause<br>zombies firms are caused either by weak<br>banks that don't like to say no<br>maybe because there's government<br>pressure on them but also ever declining<br>interest rates so a zombie firm is one<br>essentially that<br>can pay the interest on its depth on its<br>massive debt<br>because interest rates are so low but it<br>can't even pay back any principal<br>they're typically very large they're<br>typically not very productive<br>um and also it means that the new<br>productive startups<br>that hypothetical cost um<br>that's real but it's not uh not<br>particularly visible<br>recessions are horrible things but they<br>do clear the decks<br>for the next crop of firms<br>so in short we've had ever lower<br>interest rates has driven a massive<br>increase in debt loadings<br>driven up asset prices of all kinds<br>bloomberg calls it the<br>everything rally to levels that<br>historically<br>have not tended to end well and in some<br>cases well beyond those levels<br>it's encouraged people to take risks<br>they don't understand it's enabled some<br>firms globally to survive that probably<br>shouldn't have<br>it's given investors the impression that<br>they don't need to worry about risk<br>people say to me oh the fed won't let<br>equities fall or the reserve bank won't<br>let house prices fall as if central<br>banks are omnipotent<br>and can save the world from itself in<br>every<br>circumstance and that fails the too good<br>to be true test<br>and one thing that could demonstrate<br>that is of course<br>the rise in inflation so inflation<br>pressures are rising<br>you can see here the top is out of our<br>business outlook survey cost pressures<br>rising<br>pricing and tensions rising uh<br>particularly in the retail sector<br>um and inflation expectations have<br>turned the corner as well still all at<br>levels that are probably<br>fine um but the interesting question is<br>what if they don't stop<br>uh we and the reserve bank and everybody<br>else is assuming this is largely<br>temporary<br>driven by the sort of the crazy<br>gyrations we've seen in economic demand<br>and also the huge freight disruptions<br>massive increase in freight costs<br>and and um and the impact that's having<br>plus the implications of the closed<br>border for wage costs and so on and so<br>forth<br>so it should all come out in the wash<br>and so the reserve bank<br>is you know quite reasonably looking<br>looking through this<br>um and and saying we're going to have to<br>keep conditioned stimulatory for a very<br>long time to be sure<br>that we're not going to get stuck um it<br>was too low inflation but the market's<br>impatient<br>and this is a global thing too this is<br>not being driven particularly by new<br>zealand though there is<br>a lot of interest in new zealand because<br>we're being seen as the prototype of the<br>post covered economy<br>since we have more or less been covered<br>free for the better part of a year<br>uh but you can see here that bond yields<br>have gone up obviously that's what rates<br>have too<br>and monetary conditions are tightening<br>you can certainly argue that that's not<br>a bad thing<br>given what we've seen happening in the<br>mortgage market but it's not the plan<br>um and so central banks are going to<br>have some tricky<br>choices to make the other thing is bank<br>funding conditions so you can see there<br>the surge in deposits that that resulted<br>from the qe funding the the wage subsidy<br>basically and that was all paid out in<br>lump sums and all landed and<br>bank accounts of all kinds but you can<br>also see that household borrowing has<br>taken off so<br>that surplus of funding has is gone it's<br>been absorbed<br>um so there is of course the funding for<br>lending program which is<br>up to 28 billion which looks like a lot<br>in the context of<br>20 billion um a year increase in<br>mortgage lending but relative to the<br>stock<br>of mortgage lending it is absolutely<br>tiny<br>and of course when a bank issues a<br>30-year mortgage they don't<br>then sort out the funding for the next<br>30 years it's it's done on a rolling<br>kind of basis a heck of a lot<br>shorter than that um and so<br>the impact on the bank funding costs is<br>going to be<br>fairly limited so we've seen one bank<br>increasing its term deposit rates<br>already<br>we've seen two banks going out and<br>issuing paper in in<br>international markets so essentially<br>there was a huge pile of liquidity made<br>available and housing said<br>thank you very much and used it all up<br>and so<br>we are seeing that that funding starting<br>to tighten up again a little bit<br>the wind has changed direction um money<br>supply<br>yeah it's a little bit out of fashion i<br>remember back when i was at the reserve<br>bank<br>um i felt sorry for the guy who did the<br>money and credit stats because no one<br>really cared about them anymore but at<br>some level it must matter here we've got<br>the us<br>money supply m2 versus the us<br>gdp you can see it's something very<br>different going on<br>and of course in times of trouble and<br>particularly times of pandemic lockdowns<br>the velocity of money how fast it spins<br>around the economy<br>has declined and that is basically<br>offset uh the increase in the stock of<br>money in terms of the impact on<br>inflation so<br>there's clearly a very unpredictable<br>relationship<br>between the quantity of money and price<br>level but is it a non-existent<br>relationship i'm not sure um<br>but people are assuming that either it<br>is non-existent or that all that money<br>is going to be successfully hooved up<br>before the velocity of money starts<br>rising<br>uh commodity prices as john mentioned<br>are increasing you can see here our<br>dairy prices<br>went ballistic overnight up 15<br>so um that's pretty phenomenal you can<br>see there that it's not just all about<br>how many cows we've gotten<br>and the weather it's very correlated to<br>oil prices for example we are riding<br>a much bigger commodity wave um here's a<br>few other commodities all going north<br>basically so in short covert 19's not<br>proving to be a particularly<br>deflationary shock<br>but central banks have responded as if<br>it is<br>and that's entirely defensible given the<br>risks and the uncertainties and<br>given we're so close to zero the the<br>asymmetric consequences of erring on<br>both sides<br>but you've got to ask can they or will<br>they change course<br>promptly if they're required to and<br>they're actually<br>telling people they won't the fed is now<br>average inflation targeting so<br>they are saying well we've had a long<br>period under so now we have to leave<br>some overs<br>uh the reserve banks talks about the<br>least regrets approach basically since<br>it's so uncertain we'd rather run<br>inflation too high<br>um then too low we heard the governor<br>say oh central banks made a terrible<br>mistake<br>of of assuming that inflation would come<br>back and tightening too<br>early you know they were fighting the<br>last war well isn't it entirely possible<br>that we're doing that again<br>assuming inflation is going to be too<br>low and fighting the last war<br>could be might might not be as well uh<br>it is i<br>don't envy central bank's jobs at the<br>moment because you can tell<br>very plausible stories um either way but<br>as mentioned there's a lot of fiscal<br>stimulus<br>that's sitting there waiting to be spent<br>the u.s saving rate hit<br>over 20 in december trillions of dollars<br>sitting there waiting uh waiting to be<br>unleashed<br>so that was incredibly quick but just um<br>some thoughts to<br>leave you with central bank independence<br>was not written on a stone tablet on<br>mount sinai<br>it was granted by politicians<br>in a very rational response to a vote in<br>public who was sick to death<br>of inflation i'm not sure that's going<br>to be the voting public's number one<br>concern over the next 10 years<br>game theory tells us that policymakers<br>will choose the least worst<br>outcome countries on unsustainable debt<br>paths<br>have no good choices left if the debts<br>on their own currency<br>they will basically face very similar<br>choices to what they had in the 1970s<br>which is default<br>or um austerity forever<br>or just keep printing money and<br>what you know deal with it that way um<br>they made one choice last time<br>and uh got away with it in a way i<br>suppose<br>it was pretty bad but how bad would it<br>be if the us government defaulted<br>um yeah so just pointing out the game if<br>you think about it in game theory terms<br>there's really only one option<br>um inflation targeting and monetary<br>fiscal coordination<br>look like the same thing on the way down<br>they do not look like the same thing on<br>the way up for countries where<br>government debt is extremely high<br>so i'm not really talking about new<br>zealand here as i said our fiscal debt<br>is quite low but in the us<br>where you saw that chart with u.s<br>government debt exploding even if<br>interest rates stay low<br>central bank independence has definitely<br>been eroded since 1990 including here in<br>new zealand<br>a little chip here a little chip there<br>uh it's added up to<br>to something reasonably significant um<br>and and covert i would suggest has<br>accelerated that process<br>so um just reiterating our forecasts do<br>have inflation petering out because we<br>see the economy going sideways this year<br>as the real cost of the closed border<br>becomes evident<br>but we also know from the 70s that<br>inflation and growth don't always<br>move together and as a central bank<br>you're sitting there with your one stone<br>and your birds flying in different<br>directions<br>so i think you can get quite existential<br>will inflation targeting<br>survive the next significant inflation<br>pressure whenever that might be<br>it might be 10 years from now it might<br>be 20 years from now<br>is inflation targeting going to be a<br>permanent part<br>of our landscape i think that's a valid<br>question<br>along with the question of what on earth<br>might come next<br>um yes i'll just point out again new<br>zealand is an oasis of relative<br>normality although exiting qe is not<br>going to be straightforward but public<br>debt corporate debt both fine household<br>debt more problematic<br>but it's also true that we are very<br>prone to global tides we are an island a<br>couple few islands but<br>we um we can't just swim off on our own<br>i'm mixing my metaphors horribly we do<br>tend to do that we bank economist<br>we can't just head off in our own<br>direction and<br>relevant to some of the very interesting<br>discussions we've had over the last<br>couple of days when the big bad stuff<br>happens<br>earthquakes pandemics financial crises<br>discussion about whether we should be<br>focusing on<br>child poverty or improving educational<br>outcomes<br>or whether we should be mitigating or<br>prevent<br>focusing on mitigating or preventing<br>climate change now those<br>debates tend to go out the window as we<br>just start cutting off legs<br>uh left right and center and so it does<br>matter right that was record speed<br>i've just about got us back on schedule<br>i'll stop there<br>well thanks so much sharon you certainly<br>made sure we didn't fall asleep at the<br>end of an<br>afternoon um<br>i'm looking around see if there's<br>questions from the floor just wave out<br>to me if there is and we'll get a mic to<br>you but in the meantime sharon i don't<br>know if you saw victoria shorts<br>presentation this morning<br>but one of the questions is referring<br>back victoria<br>said that in her view the biggest risk<br>to households in terms of servicing<br>servicing debt is growing unemployment<br>so avoiding recession<br>seems to be the key what are your<br>thoughts do you agree<br>it would be great if we could avoid<br>recessions<br>but just like fashions keep changing<br>recessions are i think<br>an inevitable part of a couple of those<br>truths i put up early that people<br>are sheep and that a lot will spend<br>every dollar they can<br>borrow or earn and that people have<br>short memories<br>you put those three things together and<br>you end up with a business cycle i mean<br>obviously you can have these<br>droughts and plugs and whatever hit you<br>as well but<br>there is an inbuilt human nature kind of<br>element to them<br>and um they're very unpleasant things<br>and they<br>they hit the most vulnerable the hardest<br>they you know they're blatantly unfair<br>uh but they do happen and<br>it's some they also serve a function<br>they serve a purpose<br>in terms of um you know if you want<br>productivity growth part of that story<br>is that the most productive firms win<br>out over the least productive ones there<br>has to be<br>a process there of creative destruction<br>things like<br>code would come along and it's not very<br>creative at all it's just destruction<br>but there is a process that has to be<br>allowed to happen<br>i would rather have a relatively mild<br>recession every eight to ten years than<br>a<br>financial crisis every 20. if that's the<br>choice<br>i mean i've made those numbers up but<br>there<br>you could make the argument that in<br>always trying to minimize<br>the recessions or maximize the output<br>today you potentially do store<br>up some problems for a bigger<br>into a bigger pile sweep them up into a<br>big pile for it at some point in the<br>future<br>thanks sharon it would be nice to have<br>choices wouldn't it although they<br>weren't great choices that you offered<br>us there<br>i'm going to combine two questions that<br>we've got from an<br>online audience the first one is to what<br>extent has financial globalization<br>implicated in some of the trends that<br>you described<br>and a kind of follow-on how do you<br>foresee the end game arising from<br>misplaced risk<br>unfolding so globalization i think most<br>people consider it's been a pretty<br>significant driver of the structural<br>decline that we've seen<br>in inflation so of course this is a<br>supply shock<br>just like uh the oil price boom in the<br>70s was a negative supply shock<br>the entrance of the chinese workforce<br>into into global trade has been<br>a slow acting very persistent positive<br>supply shock and of course the inflation<br>targeting<br>regime doesn't cope well with supply<br>shocks it's essentially designed around<br>an assumption<br>that output and inflation pressures will<br>move together most of the time and when<br>they don't it'll be temporary<br>and you can look through it but that<br>long run impact<br>of globalization hasn't been short-lived<br>at all and so so we've seen interest<br>rate<br>central banks keep interest rates very<br>very low in response to low cpi<br>inflation even though<br>asset price inflation has had quite<br>quite the 20 years um and so<br>well that that's that's the problem yeah<br>how's it going to play out<br>well that's a very difficult question<br>because global financial markets are<br>essentially made up of millions of<br>people trying to guess what millions of<br>other people are thinking<br>at any given moment but i would say<br>you're just starting to see a few<br>wobbles<br>a few people sort of taking their drink<br>and sidling towards the door<br>hoping to exit quickly um<br>maybe you know someone will put on a<br>great song and everyone will keep on<br>dancing for a while yet but<br>there's just a few wobbles emerging um<br>because the danger time is when<br>economies are doing better not at the<br>trough of it all because<br>when things are going better then the<br>question becomes when are they going to<br>take the punch bowl away<br>and what will that look like it's<br>certainly going to be interesting to<br>catch up in a year's time isn't it and<br>see where we're sitting in a year's time<br>were there any last questions from the<br>floor<br>i'll throw in a couple if nobody else<br>has any uh that is fantastic thanks a<br>lot sharon<br>um i really appreciate the zombie firm<br>risk scares the heck out of me too<br>they're trying to balance off paying<br>firms to shut down when they're told to<br>shut down for public health reasons<br>against ha creating zombies and<br>supporting sectors that are going to<br>have to restructure<br>to my mind that means shifting towards<br>loan financing<br>rather than continued grants i was<br>wondering whether you'd had any thoughts<br>on that<br>and then more broadly all of this piling<br>into asset price risking<br>asset price risk if we look ages back<br>some of the debates around how to<br>measure inflation<br>like the approach that we've taken is<br>all around consumption bundles but<br>there's stuff<br>i think with klein and alcian we're<br>looking at the price of constant utility<br>bundles rather than constant consumption<br>bundles<br>so tracking the price of attaining a<br>constant unit utility over time rather<br>than constant<br>bundle over time and then that brings<br>assets automatically into the mix you<br>can start targeting that<br>rather than consumer prices and not just<br>blowing out asset prices all the time<br>now that takes one of the channels out<br>because you don't get the wealth effect<br>through asset price inflation anymore<br>but scaring the hell out of me what<br>they're doing<br>to asset prices as consequence of all<br>this so<br>double barrel question have fun<br>um yeah so your second point is is a<br>very interesting one because the<br>question is<br>if well if inflation targeting is too<br>simplistic<br>what's better and that's one of the<br>great ironies you know<br>money is so fundamental to human society<br>and it was invented quite early on<br>because it is so useful<br>and yet we can't seem to agree on the<br>most basic<br>questions about it like who should who<br>should control the supply of it<br>it is it is quite ironic but you know<br>maybe maybe your idea will become<br>uh the next next regime after after<br>we've cleared all the decks<br>uh and in relation to your first point<br>um yeah i guess<br>i guess asking firms to take on debt<br>would help sort the wheat from the chaff<br>but it would also be a little bit brutal<br>potentially<br>um insofar as it does mean yet more debt<br>yet more bringing forward spending from<br>the future and as we know that future<br>tends to arrive in a fairly lumpy<br>fashion<br>um called called recessions um and so<br>you you need to do it in a very careful<br>way but it didn't just then<br>undermine what your actual actual<br>objectives were which<br>was to get strategically important and<br>valuable firms safely through<br>a very difficult situation that's not of<br>of their own making<br>but obviously there are limits to things<br>like the wage subsidy we just cannot<br>afford<br>to save every firm and the government to<br>the credit has been quite clear on that<br>from the beginning and it is brutal and<br>it is unfair<br>but you know we don't actually have a<br>magic pot of money that just keeps<br>well thank you so much um sharon for<br>that and it's certainly given us lots of<br>food for thought to end the day on<br>um a great presentation uh really uh has<br>tied together lots of other issues we've<br>been talking about over the last few<br>days<br>so thanks so much and really appreciate<br>your<br>insights</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
