just<br>some reflections<br>over the last 12 months and as we all<br>know new zealand was enjoying pretty<br>favorable conditions<br>you know the economy was in good shape i<br>think the banking sector was in a good<br>position<br>despite the record low interest rates<br>and the reserve bank's use of monetary<br>tools let's say was comparatively benign<br>i think it became very apparent very<br>quickly that covert 19 would change<br>all of that and i distinctly remember<br>being on a call with a bank that was<br>based in italy<br>and they also had branches in china and<br>they were relaying to us an excruciating<br>detail the impacts that this virus was<br>having<br>and we really responded in the way that<br>you would expect a bank to respond<br>i guess beyond the health and safety of<br>our people<br>and our customers we ran a lot of<br>scenarios or the alphabet scenarios so<br>we had v-shaped<br>l-shaped u-shaped we even had a fat<br>u-shaped scenario<br>wk you name it i think the reality is is<br>no one really knew<br>and so our job was to make sure that we<br>were running lots of scenarios and<br>understanding<br>impact on particularly capital and<br>liquidity to make sure that we were well<br>placed to support our customers in the<br>economy<br>and we created a significant provision<br>so we raised and<br>today we have a provision of around 600<br>million<br>i think the thing that really worked in<br>particularly in the first sort of<br>four months of that phase was the way<br>that we worked<br>together with government and the reserve<br>bank and industry<br>so it has been a huge combined effort<br>from as i said the government the rb the<br>banking sector<br>really working hand in glove to keep the<br>economy moving forward<br>i think the government relief tools the<br>bank's tailored packages<br>and the rb obviously used virtually<br>every monetary policy<br>tool at its disposal so um<br>i think the uh moving at that pace<br>really required us to work extremely<br>closely together<br>we didn't always agree and neither<br>should we<br>but what we did is we shared all of the<br>insight and intel that we had<br>so that if we needed to make some<br>adjustments we did and we could and i<br>think the<br>business finance guarantee scheme was<br>actually a really good example of that<br>where<br>we launched that into the marketplace to<br>support businesses<br>as it was initially constructed we made<br>some tweaks to make it<br>uh more widespread in terms of its usage<br>so i think that's a really um as i said<br>a good example of that<br>i think the initial focus was very much<br>on uh from a banking perspective making<br>sure that we helped with the flow<br>of credit um and as we all know<br>banks need to really i guess balance<br>carefully that objective<br>of this flow of credit into businesses<br>and households<br>but at the same time having an eye to<br>responsible lending<br>and making sure that it's the right<br>decision for the long term<br>and so we're very confident about the<br>support we gave our customers<br>and are still providing our customers<br>which is a balance of frankly debt but<br>also<br>in many instances helping businesses<br>re-capitalize<br>shore up their balance sheets and have<br>more resilient settings<br>so i think when we sort of boil all of<br>that down the crucial thing was really<br>that jobs were saved<br>uh and and quite quickly there was um<br>initially there was a lot of fear about<br>people losing jobs that dissipated quite<br>quickly<br>and so i think that's been the most<br>distinguishing factor really of this<br>recovery<br>and i hear it all the time from our<br>customers those wage<br>subsidies really helped give employers<br>the confidence and the courage to<br>retain the employees despite the fact<br>that they had<br>very little idea of how this would play<br>out um and i think the<br>breathing room that banks provided for<br>the lending deferrals<br>the lowering of the interest rates all<br>really played their part<br>and what we've seen of course is that<br>we've had a really strong rebound in<br>retail spending<br>and housing activity which i'll cover at<br>a moment<br>um but i think the reality is this level<br>of activity can't be sustained and<br>we're anticipating this year to be a lot<br>more moderate<br>the one other sort of stark observation<br>is that this crisis has been very<br>unusual compared to the global financial<br>crisis which<br>we all remember was about the lack of<br>funds to<br>support the economy and i think we're<br>very<br>fortunate position and we've learnt a<br>lot since then<br>banks have gone into this particular<br>this crisis<br>well capitalized liquidity is strong and<br>so there hasn't been that same challenge<br>and in fact in the first four months of<br>the crisis<br>we supported over 35 000 of our<br>customers<br>with relief on around 11 billion dollars<br>so<br>that was a lot of work to get that into<br>place but it was quick<br>and i guess the availability and the<br>pricing of capital wasn't the issue<br>as we stand today you might be<br>interested to know that about<br>15 of our personal and business<br>customers<br>are still on those arrangements and so i<br>think it's very important to<br>sort of recognize that whilst the<br>recovery in new zealand has been really<br>positive<br>we are not out of the woods and a lot of<br>support is still required<br>and we know globally borders are still<br>an issue vaccines are an issue<br>new strains are an issue and we're<br>seeing some double-dip recessions<br>in large parts of the global economy<br>like europe<br>so there's a lot to be proud of but also<br>a lot to watch out for<br>and so when we think about monetary<br>policy uh<br>wow we've seen some unprecedented<br>changes in monetary uh policy action<br>over the last year um you know obviously<br>with the ocr<br>um i guess being cut to as close to zero<br>as the reserve bank felt comfortable<br>doing large-scale quantitative easing to<br>really help keep<br>those interest rates low we've seen<br>great initiatives from the reserve bank<br>and the funding for lending program<br>which they lend directly into the banks<br>very low late rates for term debt and<br>then just recently the reserve bank made<br>a very helpful statement about it's<br>continuing to reinforce<br>that it will provide all of the monetary<br>stimulus that the economy needs<br>and will be ready to act if something<br>happens i think those<br>are really important and helpful<br>statements and while i<br>very much hope it doesn't come to this<br>we also have an industry or banking<br>industry that is now ready for negative<br>interest rates<br>should that be required so really the<br>lens to this discussion that i want to<br>bring is about how we<br>translate monetary policy um and and<br>how does that look when we think about<br>our customers and we all know that<br>monetary policy is a big<br>it's a blunt instrument uh and it's been<br>very effective but also creates some<br>real challenges that i thought i would<br>just sort of um<br>share some perspectives on i think the<br>first<br>challenge really is that businesses have<br>yet<br>to respond so many businesses that we<br>talk to<br>are more concerned with having resilient<br>balance sheet settings trying to get<br>more clarity on what the outlook might<br>be<br>particularly this sort of border are we<br>in lockdown out of lockdown kind of<br>environment that we're going through at<br>the moment<br>and they really are taking more of a<br>wait and see approach<br>and so even though there is a lot of<br>credit available even though the prices<br>or the price of that credit is extremely<br>low in comparative terms<br>that's not enough to really encourage<br>businesses um<br>to really take that next step forward so<br>i think that's the first thing that<br>we're<br>really keeping an eye on the second<br>thing is deposits<br>so obviously when interest rates really<br>fall i mean that's the objective of the<br>monetary policy settings<br>it has a big impact on deposits<br>and we know that some people are very<br>reliant on the income that they earn<br>from those deposits and that's been a<br>real concern of ours is how do we<br>balance these objectives and so actually<br>just recently we increased our term<br>deposit rates<br>um by 75 basis points to really try and<br>give that lift<br>for some people who are highly dependent<br>on those<br>income sources another element of<br>deposits is that we are seeing a<br>large balances unusual balances<br>sitting in accounts that have come from<br>uh two things<br>firstly lower levels of spending and<br>then secondly a lot of government<br>support so<br>there's around 39 billion dollars worth<br>of i would say additional deposits<br>sitting in the system at the moment<br>as a result of those two factors so one<br>of the questions we keep asking<br>ourselves is are those deposits stable<br>and will they flow out as fast as<br>they're flowed in<br>um so we need to be very careful about<br>how we think about those deposits when<br>we manage our balance sheet settings<br>uh as a bank so that's sort of a few of<br>the<br>deposit considerations i think the one<br>that<br>um we've all got our eye on uh is this<br>housing market issue<br>um you know and this is a a well-known<br>sort of<br>challenge the low interest rate<br>environments have absolutely stimulated<br>huge housing demand and it makes perfect<br>sense<br>you know the first home owners are<br>realizing that they can afford<br>a mortgage compared to rent because of<br>the interest rates<br>a lot of homeowners are looking to scale<br>up or buy additional<br>holiday home properties and then of<br>course we have investors<br>who for a couple of reasons a the low<br>interest rates but b<br>when they weigh out the risk profile of<br>different investment alternatives<br>they really like the land bricks and<br>mortar so<br>that's the real dynamic on the demand<br>side and of course we know that<br>new zealand's supply side challenges<br>have been around for decades<br>so we've really come to the crunch point<br>last year we decided to<br>increase the lvrs for investors ahead of<br>the reserve bank's changes to try and<br>sort of<br>stem a little bit of that it didn't make<br>enough difference<br>uh so recently uh we um went a step<br>further and so we're requiring a 40<br>lvr for investors um to be candid with<br>you<br>we have not yet seen the impact of that<br>change<br>either we are really struggling with the<br>home loan applications that<br>remain at record volumes so it's going<br>to be really interesting to see this<br>next step which is the government adding<br>the<br>housing market to the mandate of the<br>reserve bank i'm really looking forward<br>to working with the reserve bank on<br>what ideas we can collectively think<br>about<br>for those or that additional mandate<br>we're talking about dti or debt to<br>income ratios um<br>interest only um as another point of<br>discussion<br>what i'll be very focused on though is<br>it needs to be orderly<br>the only thing worse than the current<br>situation would be if we had an<br>unorderly impact<br>so we need to be very careful when we um<br>sort of make these changes and<br>adjustments<br>i guess we've also seen some great<br>opportunities though<br>also come from some of the initiatives<br>around<br>monetary policy and associated<br>initiatives that the reserve bank's been<br>taking and<br>funding the funding for lending programs<br>one that<br>is definitely worth talking about so you<br>know the<br>reserve bank is direct lending into uh<br>banks at low rates the ocr um for<br>a term period three years um and i think<br>that's given us a<br>really exciting opportunity to think<br>about<br>what is the best way of distributing<br>that<br>of those funds and so at asb we've<br>really<br>chosen to do that and focus in on three<br>areas<br>firstly we think it's really important<br>to support businesses<br>who are trying to lower emissions to<br>achieve new zealand's overall climate<br>objectives<br>secondly we really want to support<br>infrastructure particularly<br>infrastructure development<br>in rural or regional new zealand and<br>then lastly<br>it's another way of supporting this<br>housing or balancing that the housing<br>challenge<br>by supporting the supply side dynamics<br>of the housing market<br>and more energy efficient more<br>affordable homes<br>so i think that's a wonderful<br>opportunity we want to use it really<br>wisely<br>to make a really long-term positive<br>impact<br>for new zealand which really brings me<br>to<br>another reflection i guess about this<br>period<br>is you know there's more volatility than<br>ever before<br>and we would like to see new zealanders<br>and businesses think about more<br>resilient settings<br>so that they can weather these<br>challenges<br>a little bit easier than what we've seen<br>and over the past<br>two years actually we've been partnering<br>with a leading university on a<br>financial well-being framework we use<br>our data<br>and we observe the the behaviour if you<br>like<br>of customers and based on all of their<br>transactions<br>and this framework is based on a very<br>simple<br>principle i guess of managing your<br>everyday payments or cash flows<br>saving for a rainy day or you know<br>events such as this<br>and then how you're moving towards<br>long-term goals whether you're a<br>personal customer or a business<br>and over the last 12 months we've seen<br>some really interesting<br>um parts of our data it definitely<br>showed<br>the reduction in spending so we see<br>about a reduction of<br>17 and it also showed an increase in<br>savings<br>these trends that i've mentioned before<br>and what we've seen is an aggregate<br>around four percent<br>but uh worryingly over the last couple<br>of months we're seeing<br>some different patterns emerge from that<br>data<br>we're seeing two things we're watching<br>very closely the first one is an<br>observation around<br>people having more difficulty making<br>payments<br>and the second one for our personal<br>customers is less customers<br>have what we describe as a rainy day<br>savings<br>fund of a thousand dollars which is a<br>pretty low bar<br>so those are the two metrics that we're<br>watching very closely and again they<br>give us an indication that<br>um it comes back to we are not out of<br>the woods yet<br>we know some businesses and some people<br>are still doing it really tough<br>and new zealand still needs support<br>to really get through um this crisis<br>so uh so i guess um you know the<br>the key reflections i really have is<br>we've got to work together<br>we don't have all of the answers there<br>was no blueprint<br>but working together um in a very<br>different way from the way that we've<br>worked together in the past is really<br>important<br>and then how do we use um the sort of<br>our future efforts to really try and<br>make sure that we're supporting a stable<br>sustainable<br>and more resilient new zealand so<br>so there we go i hope that's given you a<br>few thoughts to prompt a few questions<br>um i think the foundations that we've<br>laid over the last 12 months um<br>standards in good stead so anna i might<br>hand back to you now<br>for um to see whether there are any<br>questions thank you so much vitoria i'm<br>sure there will be lots of questions and<br>what a wonderful start of course we've<br>got the governor of the reserve bank<br>coming up next so it was a great lead<br>into his presentation<br>lots of interesting issues raised there<br>any questions from the floor that we'd<br>like to<br>i'm going to start with one inventory<br>that's slightly tangential from your<br>presentation but i saw it come through<br>on slido and i thought it was an<br>interesting<br>question what's happening to remittances<br>to the pacific<br>because i guess we focus very much on<br>new zealand um<br>but i'm just curious what's happened<br>to our pacific neighbours sure<br>tangential but but a very important one<br>uh so um i guess the issue um that<br>uh really is occurring around the world<br>at the moment<br>is that financial crime has greatly<br>increased and we all know this<br>and we see the nature of cyber threats<br>has elevated and really changed as well<br>so i guess the um the whole challenge<br>with remittances<br>worldwide is this this crime element<br>so a lot of processes have been added<br>which i think have really restricted<br>some of the flows and remittances to the<br>pacific islands<br>um we don't want that to be the case so<br>we're actually working again this is<br>another great example of<br>how do we share data and risk data<br>so that we can make sure that we're<br>safely supporting that remittance<br>activity to the islands because we know<br>it's important for them<br>so that's the position that we are<br>in we need to solve for it and really<br>make sure we're playing our part<br>yeah thanks very much and of course it<br>is an important issue because<br>our friends around the world are<br>suffering greatly from covert and<br>particularly in developing countries we<br>might be concerned we've all been pretty<br>great<br>quick to grab vaccines and grab things<br>for our rich countries<br>but i guess i feel pretty concerned when<br>i look at my 21 year old daughter in<br>north carolina who's likely to get a<br>vaccine<br>next month whereas our friends in india<br>who are working in the health sector are<br>likely to be working a long time and i<br>guess in the pacific islands we've got<br>some similar<br>differences in access to health care<br>okay let me turn to a question coming<br>through another question<br>vittoria if you were running the reserve<br>bank so take adrian's place for a moment<br>what structural changes would you<br>consider to improve the recovery<br>while still managing risk of further<br>shocks<br>yes i'm sure you're going to ask adrian<br>the same question what would he do if he<br>was running asb<br>um i need to make sure i hang around for<br>that answer by the way adrian<br>um i think look i'm going to the way i<br>want to answer that question is actually<br>to think about how we work better<br>together<br>and one of the real opportunities that's<br>come up that we observed during these<br>last 12 months is how do we share<br>how do we get more data how do we share<br>more data and how do we stitch our data<br>together<br>because the rb's um sitting on a lot of<br>you know big macro data we sit on a lot<br>of<br>so if you call it the micro data and i'm<br>not sure that we're<br>um as joined up as we could be and<br>therefore<br>we might be missing um some trends we<br>might be missing some opportunities to<br>really<br>understand the impact of either monetary<br>policy settings or the way that we<br>transmit that through the bank<br>so um i know that um that<br>you know there is an initiative um at<br>the reserve bank<br>uh and some new team members who are<br>going to be leading that efforts and i<br>think that's really important<br>it's sort of the first thing i would<br>call that is how do we use our data<br>share our data more effectively and<br>efficiently to<br>for the good of the country i think the<br>um the second thing that i would say is<br>that<br>um you know just staying on the topic of<br>monetary policy for a moment<br>it's back to how do we make sure that um<br>i use this word orderly that we're<br>making orderly changes and that we don't<br>have these<br>um unintended consequences so that we're<br>sort of fire fighting all the time so i<br>think we need to be very<br>careful um in<br>which tools are applied when and how<br>that's sort of really a statement of the<br>obvious but what it takes is<br>again a lot of engagement and sharing of<br>information and data on what's happening<br>to see how the country is responding<br>um you know i hope we don't need<br>negative<br>interest rates i've been quite public<br>about that and um<br>adrian and i have had some good<br>conversations about that topic but<br>yeah it's really important to continue<br>to have robust debate those are the<br>things i think are really<br>let's make it orderly be careful about<br>it and let's<br>use data in a better way to support the<br>objectives<br>thanks and as an economist who's lived<br>quite a bit in in japan over<br>uh recent years um negative interest<br>rates are a pretty interesting<br>thing to deal with it turns quite a bit<br>of our standard economic thinking on its<br>head<br>um and it's a bit difficult to grapple<br>with we end up advocating policies that<br>we might not normally um be thinking<br>would be good policies<br>um it was interesting to uh you know it<br>came through in your presentation<br>as a bank you've got the chance to<br>change some of your settings the reserve<br>bank of course is changing some of its<br>policy settings<br>but i was really interested in your<br>presentation to see how you're<br>using this as an opportunity to promote<br>other things that you think are<br>important and i think we've got those<br>opportunities in a wider economy<br>for you it was the emissions and it was<br>the housing<br>and the infrastructure so great okay i'm<br>going to move<br>on to quite a specific question victoria<br>please<br>have you done any stress tests on what<br>rate of<br>interest will lead to potential defaults<br>yeah so stress testing<br>i mean as you know we run a lot of<br>stress tests and they're becoming<br>increasingly<br>complicated because the um<br>what we tend to focus on now is<br>interrelated<br>uh component parts of a stress test<br>rather than single dimension because<br>what we're seeing is<br>when you test on a single dimension it<br>never results<br>in in sort of<br>really catastrophic events it's when you<br>actually have multi-dimensional<br>stress tests that you really get into<br>problem zones which really make you<br>think about how would you solve for<br>those<br>so um at a total bank<br>level um that's what we do i think a<br>different way of answering that question<br>around<br>interest rates though is that i'm sure<br>everyone's familiar we don't just<br>lend at or test serviceability at the<br>prevailing rate of interest<br>we add servicing buffers so<br>we will always be several hundred basis<br>points um<br>well above the um prevailing interest<br>rate to make sure that<br>uh that customers can service it's part<br>of our responsible lending criteria as<br>well so i think that's another<br>important dynamic if you like in terms<br>of thinking about<br>interest rates and the impact on stress<br>and serviceability and repayment<br>what would be the other sort of key<br>things that you'd look at along with the<br>interest rates in victoria is it sort of<br>growth rates what what are the key<br>things that you you'd be focused on that<br>will create stressful income<br>employment that is that is the<br>fundamental<br>um uh if you were to pick one thing that<br>matters<br>it's employment and and i think that<br>really sort of underpins the comment i<br>was trying to make earlier on<br>about new zealand's recovery the way<br>that we were able to hold on to jobs the<br>way that<br>employers had the confidence to keep<br>their people employed really really<br>made the difference and so obviously<br>when you're employed your ability<br>um to to you know to borrow um<br>i mean that's the crucial thing it's not<br>actually the interest rates per se it's<br>employment<br>yeah and we certainly have kept those<br>employment rates pretty um<br>low what's your view on the extent to<br>which that's just driven by the current<br>policy settings and once those policy<br>settings change the subsidies and so on<br>um are we do you have a view on whether<br>whether this is likely to blow out the<br>unemployment numbers or do you think<br>that we're going to be able to keep a<br>fairly stable path<br>i guess it gets back to your your issue<br>of what shape recovery are we going to<br>have<br>yes so i do think and we know that um<br>there are uh there are some businesses<br>who are doing exceptionally well in fact<br>better than before uh the pandemic<br>started<br>there are some businesses that um are<br>doing very well<br>i think the at a at a macro level<br>um i personally we are expecting the<br>employment level<br>the unemployment levels to increase<br>slightly but not to<br>a level that's dramatic um because we've<br>seen there's a lot of resilience<br>um uh still to date<br>and we will continue to support those<br>customers that absolutely need it the<br>most<br>so uh so i sort of come back to you know<br>we're not out of the woods yet<br>new zealand still needs support but<br>at this stage um i think um unemployment<br>uh we're not significantly concerned<br>about unemployment levels either today<br>or for the remainder of the year<br>yeah thanks for that we've got a couple<br>of minutes left are there any questions<br>from the floor otherwise i'll return<br>we've got a very active online audience<br>so thanks very much to you guys that are<br>on<br>online okay let me go to another<br>question from our online audience please<br>victoria<br>how do you see banking changing with um<br>fintech new models<br>and how does that um put support or risk<br>of financial stability and economic<br>growth you know how do you see those<br>factors playing in together please<br>i think that's um you know one of the<br>most exciting parts of the job actually<br>which is<br>you know all of the new uh models that<br>are emerging in banking<br>and and how do we really um you know<br>frankly we just need to continue to up<br>our game because there's so many<br>different exciting<br>options out there the number one concern<br>i have<br>is regulatory arbitrage we've observed<br>this issue<br>in many other major economies around the<br>world<br>where the prevailing incumbents<br>are absolutely regulated and<br>the new entrants are not and so<br>what happens is you get a lack of<br>innovation occurring in the<br>in the incumbent um and you have<br>uh the new sort of the new techs<br>that often frankly particularly the<br>larger ones and i'm referring to big<br>tech here<br>um grab a significant chunk of the value<br>they don't pay the local taxes they<br>don't employ people in the local<br>economies<br>and so we're starting to see i guess a<br>real economic detriment<br>from what is well intended to have lots<br>of competition in the marketplace which<br>is a good thing<br>but it's not really helping the economy<br>at an overall level so i think that's<br>probably the most important thing<br>a level a level playing field difficult<br>to create that of course with new<br>industries with regulators often playing<br>catch up with<br>uh with what's going on in those in<br>those industries um<br>just a couple of brief questions we'll<br>go over a minute or two just because we<br>started a wee bit late on on your<br>session<br>um you spoke of the increase in deposits<br>is there any evidence that some of those<br>might be coming from unspent government<br>subsidies yes there is definitely<br>yeah that's the quick answer the the<br>government um<br>uh it's it's a combination of the two i<br>need to be clear though it's<br>um obviously um there was<br>monies that came in from the government<br>subsidies and there's been this<br>um reduction in spending it's the two<br>things that work together<br>that have resulted in the um<br>in the higher balances yeah thanks for<br>that um brief and insightful answer<br>the um the last question for you<br>vittoria before we move on to our next<br>presenter and it's a nice lead into<br>adrian's presentation how worried are<br>you about the potential return of<br>inflation um that's a watch out<br>again this is this comes back to<br>how do we try and move forward in an<br>orderly way<br>how do we not have too many sort of<br>knee-jerk reactions or lots of change<br>happening<br>all at once that might impact and create<br>an<br>unorderly shift so i i think we<br>definitely need to keep a watch out on<br>it<br>uh so much for all of those insights and<br>that uh wonderful<br>presentation we've certainly had some<br>themes coming through there including<br>the need for order<br>when there's changes in policy settings<br>so i guess you and your customers can<br>adjust<br>appropriately thanks so much wonderful<br>presentation let's uh thank victoria and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
