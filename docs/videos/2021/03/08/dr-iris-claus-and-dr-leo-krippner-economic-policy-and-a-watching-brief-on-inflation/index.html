be a joint presentation with leo on<br>economic policy and watching brief on<br>inflation<br>but first of all i would like to thank<br>the organizers to inviting us<br>to this really stimulating and<br>thought-provoking<br>event and congratulate you on on<br>organizing it<br>so the objective of economic policy<br>is to increase living standards<br>in the well-being of the people in the<br>country<br>and therefore channels through which<br>higher living standards and well-being<br>can be achieved<br>the first channel is macroeconomic<br>stabilization<br>so the idea here is to reduce output<br>fluctuations so output volatility<br>and business cycle fluctuations the<br>second channel through which we can<br>achieve higher living standards and<br>well-being<br>is through lifting productive capacity<br>so the idea here is<br>to have productive government<br>expenditure<br>that leads to more private sector<br>investment<br>and increases in productivity and you<br>have a tax system<br>that generates revenue in a in a fair<br>and equitable way<br>the third channel for lifting<br>productivity<br>for lifting well-being and<br>living standards is through equitable<br>distribution<br>so the idea here is to distribute<br>resources wealth and income<br>according to what people consider fair<br>and the fourth channel is to provide<br>a safety net so to have some minimum<br>protection<br>and security provided to people who are<br>in need and when they need<br>support there are three main policy<br>tools<br>the the first tool for<br>supporting well-being in an increase in<br>living standards is<br>okay thank you the second<br>policy tool is cisco policy so the<br>reference here is to the use of<br>public finance instruments so this<br>includes government spending<br>revenue generation and management of the<br>government's balance sheet<br>and the third policy tool is regulation<br>which is really fundamental for markets<br>and societies to function<br>and so regulation is used to ensure<br>competition fair trade accurate<br>information in the marketplace<br>to protect the rights of consumers and<br>safety of residents and to safeguard the<br>environment<br>so the cobalt 19 pandemic has severely<br>impacted<br>on people's living standards and and<br>well-being<br>the covenant in shock is unusual and<br>different<br>from the sharks that the economy usually<br>experiences because it's an uncertainty<br>shock<br>we don't know how long the pandemic is<br>going to last<br>and we don't know how the economy will<br>adjust or they have started to adjust<br>in response to this shock and so because<br>it's an uncertainty shock<br>consumption has fallen and savings has<br>increased<br>because of uncertain employment in<br>income prospects<br>but also productive capacity has<br>declined because of<br>supply disruptions and because of<br>delayed uncertainty by businesses<br>in response to to the uncertainty the<br>pandemic<br>is also unusual in that it has<br>led to unprecedented policy actions<br>and these policy actions have had at<br>least four consequences<br>which i will spend the rest of my time<br>talking about<br>the first consequence in terms of the<br>policy responses is with respect to<br>monetary and fiscal policy<br>so the reserve bank of new zealand<br>currently does not<br>adjust the policy rate to adjust<br>to change monetary policy so the the<br>policy rate<br>um the overnight um cash rate or ocr<br>is near near zero so the reserve bank<br>could have continued to influence<br>interest rates<br>by using the derivative the<br>interest rate derivative market but<br>instead<br>the reserve bank has started to purchase<br>government bonds<br>and local government funding agency<br>bonds in the secondary market<br>and the reserve bank pays for these<br>bonds purchases<br>by crediting settlement account balances<br>that are held at the rbnz by settlers<br>banks<br>and so these large-scale asset purchases<br>have increased seniority so senior which<br>are the profits that the reserve bank<br>makes<br>from issuing central bank money and the<br>increase<br>in phoenix has also increased the<br>government funding<br>because the government is the<br>beneficial owner of the central bank<br>and so the most of the the profits from<br>the reserve bank<br>are paid to the government in the form<br>of dividends<br>and so these large-scale asset purchases<br>have increased governments borrowing<br>but without increasing the crown's<br>indebtedness<br>because the most of the debt issued by<br>the government is held by the<br>by the venture bank the reserve bank<br>is also undertaking funding funding for<br>lending program<br>under which it lends to eligible banks<br>at below market interest rates<br>and so because of these two facts that<br>the central bank has currently providing<br>substantial funding to the government<br>and also engages in<br>concessional lending the central bank<br>effectively has become a fiscal<br>agent and the implication of this is<br>that<br>we can no longer at the moment<br>independently specify<br>the second consequence so financial<br>reporting is essential<br>for for sound economic management<br>or management in general and so<br>to conduct some sound economic<br>management<br>we need comprehensive public sector<br>financial information which we currently<br>do not have so the financial statements<br>for the government which are produced by<br>treasury<br>they don't include local government and<br>the government finance statistics which<br>are produced by statistics new zealand<br>do not include public corporations which<br>most importantly includes the<br>the central bank also to reassure<br>markets of the operational independence<br>of the central bank<br>we lead transparent reporting about the<br>fiscal and quasi-fiscal transactions<br>that<br>are currently being undertaken by the<br>central bank<br>we need to report consolidated public<br>debt<br>both excluding and including the reserve<br>bank settlement cash<br>so excluding it because central bank<br>money<br>is irredeemable so in fact there's a<br>liability in<br>in name only and including the reserve<br>bank settlement cash<br>because total liability is what affects<br>the third consequence i would like to<br>talk about policy makes<br>so most of the policy and actions or<br>responses<br>to the core 19 pandemic have focused on<br>macroeconomic<br>stabilization but we don't know<br>currently how large the supply and<br>demand effects of the pandemic are<br>what monetary in fiscal stimulus is<br>needed or in fact<br>is is effective so greater reliance on<br>automatic stabilizers<br>or policies that provide a safety net<br>would reduce the need for stabilization<br>during economic downturns or natural<br>disasters which new zealand<br>regularly experiences so one<br>such example is universal income so<br>universal income<br>will provide a safety net but it would<br>also support<br>structural adjustment and so increase<br>the efficiency<br>of the economy another example is<br>with current taxes on email by property<br>so if they were linked to property price<br>movements<br>they would become an automatic<br>stabilizer<br>this probably will require a new funnily<br>model for local governments<br>but which could also be designed to<br>with the emergency or as the<br>emergency responses to the pandemic<br>are passing policies we need to<br>shift from short-term responses<br>to raising well-being long-term there<br>are several ways of<br>achieving this by refocusing on<br>sustainability<br>um strengthening reasonable<br>collaboration<br>so through free trade labor mobility<br>harmonization with our pacific neighbors<br>including<br>high seas fishing and also by<br>progressing environmental<br>objectives climate change is the most<br>pressing issue of our time<br>for example a regional carbon credit<br>scheme could be<br>developed for forestry and potentially<br>for seaweed and algae<br>so the forest area in the pacific it's<br>almost a third of the size of the amazon<br>forest<br>and the pacific region controls 28<br>of the world's exclusive economic zone<br>the last consequence i would like to<br>talk about this is price signals<br>surprises given allocation give<br>signals about the for the allocation of<br>resources<br>but prices also very importantly signal<br>potential imbalances in the economy so<br>if monetary and fiscal stimulus<br>is above or what the economy can sustain<br>we produce<br>this will raise inflation or inflation<br>expectations<br>also rising debt may lead to higher<br>inflation<br>or higher inflation expectations<br>if markets expected authorities will try<br>to inflate away the debt<br>when in fact that's what they're trying<br>to do<br>prices typically only adjusts with<br>just with the leg and so measuring and<br>monitoring<br>inflation expectation is very important<br>which leads us to the second part of<br>this presentation<br>on a watching brief of inflation<br>thank you iris and thank you very much<br>uh to the organizers for putting<br>together<br>the program and i very much appreciate<br>the the chance to uh to speak<br>so as always mentioned i'll be talking<br>about inflation<br>in particular what i've done with my<br>work is to estimate a daily time series<br>of the inflation term structure and<br>i'll talk about what that means on the<br>following slide<br>and the inflation term structure<br>includes the inflation risk premium and<br>i'll talk about that on the subsequent<br>slide<br>so doing this allows a timely monitoring<br>of<br>inflation expectations and inflation<br>risk premium developments<br>and this is important in the current<br>environment because it's essentially<br>become a hot topic<br>markets are getting a little bit more uh<br>worried about<br>the potential for higher inflation uh<br>particularly given some of the uh<br>stimulus that's going on uh both fiscal<br>elementary<br>um and then we've got like the um the<br>biden uh stimulus plan and<br>in the um us uh yet to feed through as<br>well<br>uh and that has the potential of raising<br>bond yields and undermine the value of<br>stock markets<br>i've got some headlines uh on those<br>things uh coming up later on but that's<br>uh the essential story<br>so the main takeaway is the graph that<br>i've got uh at the bottom of the page<br>here<br>and it's for the united states and those<br>results show<br>that uh the covered induced angst about<br>falling inflation<br>that occurred immediately after the<br>covert crisis took hold<br>has now more than reversed to above<br>precovered angst about rising inflation<br>so you can see the blue dot there about<br>how low that inflation premium got<br>and i'll talk about that shortly and<br>then how high it's most<br>more recently risen what is the<br>inflation term structure<br>well you can basically think of it as<br>being<br>a plot of expectations about inflation<br>by horizon or time to maturity<br>and what i've got as examples here is<br>the united states<br>in april 2020 shortly after the covert<br>crisis took hold and started becoming uh<br>you know<br>well noticed by authorities and uh uh<br>and markets<br>and so there's two ways you can think<br>about the inflation term structure<br>one is the typical way that a survey<br>question about inflation is asked<br>so in consensus forecast which is the<br>data that i use<br>they will ask survey participants where<br>do you think<br>annual inflation will be in one year<br>time one year's time where do you think<br>it will be in two years time<br>three years time four years time and on<br>average where do you think it'll<br>be in six to ten years time the average<br>over that period<br>and so that would be how you plot those<br>uh blue survey dots<br>uh in the left-hand chart then<br>there's these things called inflation<br>swaps and inflation swaps are not<br>quite exactly the same thing as<br>inflation expectations because<br>they're a financial instrument and<br>therefore they include a risk premium<br>as well as the underlying inflation<br>expectation but the way that inflation<br>swaps are traded<br>is they'll say essentially where do you<br>think uh<br>inflation with that risk premium is<br>going to average up to one year<br>what do you think the average is going<br>to be up to the two-year time to<br>maturity the three year time to maturity<br>etc<br>and you can get these quotes in standard<br>markets uh the united states the euro<br>area<br>uh and the uk for example uh going out<br>for one to thirty years<br>now when people trade these inflation<br>swaps<br>they're directly trading a view<br>on inflation so basically someone will<br>take a<br>a fixed rate of inflation that they are<br>obliged to pay out<br>to the other side other party who will<br>pay out<br>to the fixed side what the realized rate<br>of inflation<br>or average rate of inflation was over<br>the horizon of that contract<br>now obviously that is going to be<br>reasonably close to what people expect<br>about inflation<br>but once again there's going to be a<br>risk premium in<br>embedded in inflation swaps<br>that will account for the risk that you<br>get from having a financial traded<br>instrument<br>i should also say that as far as i know<br>they are available in new zealand as<br>well it's just that<br>it's quite a bespoke market so uh i<br>worked in financial markets and<br>at the time and z for example offered um<br>contracts on inflation that could be<br>traded<br>as an over-the-counter uh instrument uh<br>it's just that they're not<br>uh as far as i've found available as<br>standard quotes<br>that i can take off a financial data<br>page and run through my<br>my model but hopefully if i talk to the<br>right people after this conference maybe<br>i can find some relevant new zealand<br>data and<br>and run that through to see what it says<br>what is the inflation risk premium i've<br>talked about it a little bit already<br>it's essentially the compensation<br>that the person who takes the fixed leg<br>of the inflation contract<br>needs to get for taking on the risk that<br>inflation<br>realized inflation could go anywhere and<br>therefore they need to be compensated<br>by the other side of the swap contract<br>party<br>to take that risk on and mathematically<br>you can think of the inflation risk<br>premium as essentially being if we've<br>got the<br>survey term structure we can compare<br>that to the<br>swap the inflation swap term structure<br>and the difference between those is<br>going to give us the risk premium<br>now that can be negative as it was in<br>april 2020 for the united states<br>if the market has got lots of angst<br>about the potential for falling<br>inflation so lots of people want to<br>speculate on inflation going lower or<br>hedge themselves against lower inflation<br>rates<br>therefore they'll chase that market and<br>you can get a negative risk premium<br>at the moment the risk premium is<br>positive<br>and that means that people essentially<br>have more angst about<br>the potential for rising inflation and<br>therefore<br>to hedge that you've got to play<br>pay a premium or people will only accept<br>the fixed side of a<br>inflation swap contract if you give them<br>a premium<br>to take that risk on and so examples of<br>what i'll abbreviate to<br>positive inflation angst in words and<br>these are all just<br>headlines from february uh just passed<br>larry summers warned about the potential<br>for the biden stimulus to lead to<br>inflation among other things the<br>economists have got their inflate gate<br>bloomberg uh quite handily and drew<br>introduced me to the term inflation<br>angst<br>and quite handily my partner iris told<br>me how to pronounce it uh in the german<br>proper german way it actually means fear<br>when you translate it<br>directly into english but i think you'll<br>agree with me that angst<br>carries more gravitas to it than fear so<br>that's why i use it<br>and that could rewrite the stock market<br>playbook as i mentioned before if bony<br>bond rates go higher and stock markets<br>have been predicated on valuations based<br>on those low bond rates<br>the stock market values could get<br>undermined cnn had an article on that<br>just recently as well<br>here in new zealand uh our very own<br>stephen joyce<br>uh warned that the covert stimulus party<br>risks waking<br>the inflationary beer and another<br>well-known columnist in new zealand<br>bernard hickey also warned about<br>something similar<br>so essentially you can think of my model<br>as both tracking inflation<br>expectations and with that risk premium<br>that gets tracked as well that<br>quantifies<br>and helps track the inflation angst<br>that the market has currently built in<br>um into both markets and then and then<br>wider financial markets as well<br>so what are the consequences of<br>inflation and<br>the inflation risk premium i won't go<br>through<br>in any detail at all about the<br>consequences<br>of um excessive inflation if it happens<br>to get realised<br>because in a room full of economists or<br>even non-economists<br>basically anyone who lived through the<br>70s or into the mid-80s<br>or can even remember that if you're a<br>student then you know that<br>excessive inflation is bad news<br>generally for an economy<br>what i do want to stress is that even<br>angst<br>about inflation does have consequences<br>and those consequences come through in<br>real time<br>so if you think about a nominal bond<br>rate<br>that the government issues bonds at so<br>essentially borrows from the market at<br>or a a nominal interest rate that say a<br>mortgage<br>holder pays for a loan from the bank<br>you can think of those nominal rates as<br>being composed of<br>four components firstly there will be<br>where<br>do you think the real short-term<br>interest rate is going to average from<br>now up until the time to maturity of<br>that loan<br>or bond where do you think every<br>inflation is going to average from now<br>up to the maturity of that loan<br>and where will be where are the<br>risk premiums currently on the real<br>interest rates<br>and where are the risk premiums<br>currently on the inflation component of<br>those nominal interest rates<br>and that's the bit that i've highlighted<br>and read there right at the end<br>now if you calculate from nominal bond<br>rates what<br>x and x anti real interest rates are<br>you simply take the expectation of<br>average inflation<br>away from your nominal interest rate<br>that's what i've got in those formulas<br>there there's nothing<br>very complicated at all and what you get<br>left with is three components<br>your expected real short term interest<br>rate on average<br>uh your risk premium on real interest<br>rates<br>and your risk premium on inflation the<br>red term that i've got right at the end<br>of that bottom equation<br>and this shows that if there's positive<br>angst<br>about inflation that will lead to<br>higher x anti real term interest rates<br>and real term interest rates or real<br>interest rates in general is is what um<br>as the<br>you know provides the economic incentive<br>uh for an economic activity<br>so you can get higher um<br>real term interest rates simply through<br>people being worried about inflation<br>so the summary of my framework and its<br>estimation uh it all became very<br>colorful<br>and i'm going to abbreviate it by saying<br>i color coded what other people<br>had previously done and then how i had<br>done sort of everything<br>and put it all together with the green<br>part saying that<br>i had done it on a daily basis and that<br>means it's handier because we can track<br>it more frequently if we need to<br>uh but i will skip to the chase by<br>saying and this is going to be a great<br>headline if anyone wants to put it<br>in the media uh what i've done is an<br>arbitrage free nelson segal model<br>estimated with the kelman filter using<br>inflation survey<br>and daily inflation swap data so that'll<br>fit nicely across the top of the waikiro<br>times<br>but more easily i think i've just<br>basically taken my<br>yield curve modelling that i've done on<br>interest rates and i've applied it to<br>inflation data the result is that i get<br>as i mentioned<br>right at the start a daily inflation<br>expectations term structure<br>and that also includes the daily risk<br>premium on inflation as well that<br>inflation angst that we can keep an eye<br>on<br>i've got that already for the united<br>states i've showed you the graph on that<br>i've got it for the euro area of the uk<br>because the data is standardly available<br>for new zealand i'll use my best<br>endeavors to see if i can track down<br>that data and run it through the same<br>model<br>and show you what it looks like so i'll<br>wrap up there by saying<br>in conclusion for both iris and i the<br>covert 19 pandemic has led to<br>unprecedented policy actions<br>it's an uncertainty shock and therefore<br>we don't know how long it's going to<br>last<br>and how it already may have or will<br>change the structure of the economy<br>and therefore we don't necessarily know<br>even now what the<br>uh appropriate policy actions are or how<br>effective they might be<br>so we've got to keep in mind that this<br>is an uncertainty<br>and it's uncertain the way that we<br>should deal with it we've done a pretty<br>good job up till now but<br>we've still got more learning and<br>testing perhaps to do<br>in terms of inflation market prices give<br>signals about potential imbalances<br>and so monitoring inflation expectations<br>is important and as i've talked about<br>with the inflation risk premium we need<br>to be aware<br>of inflation fear the angst or angst<br>about<br>rising inflation and of course this guy<br>from the 1930s had plenty to say about<br>fear<br>or fear itself i wasn't there so<br>i don't know exactly what he said so<br>i'll leave it there<br>and if we're very lucky we might<br>actually get an animation<br>of what the evolution of<br>the inflation expectations and the<br>inflation risk from him for the united<br>states<br>looks like over time i don't need to<br>commentate this so we can go straight<br>into questions if you'd like while<br>thank you very much for those<br>presentations any questions from the<br>floor<br>is there one over there<br>perhaps while we're getting the mic over<br>there i'll ask you one that ties in with<br>the previous presentation<br>looking at john mcdermott's model<br>results earlier<br>we will be in for an extended period of<br>low interest rates and<br>iris would you like i i i can offer<br>some immediate comments and and say<br>if you look at the current environment<br>um with<br>uh very strong fiscal stimulus<br>and monetary stimulus and say supply<br>disruptions on<br>you know things that we import from<br>around the world or generally what the<br>world<br>imports and exports all around the world<br>in various economies<br>and the international labour market uh<br>disinflationary force receding it was<br>very large in the 90s and sort of 2000s<br>we've probably got the best environment<br>for an increased inflation now<br>that we had compared to the 1970s<br>whether that will be realized is the key<br>question that's why we have to keep an<br>eye on it<br>interesting insight after that<br>discussion this morning on deflation<br>uh should we go over to you here great<br>thanks um interesting stuff i<br>i love watching those graphs it's great<br>it'll be neat to see the new zealand<br>version<br>a bit of a question for iris you'd<br>mention potentially a ubi<br>as counter cyclical somehow or providing<br>some stabilization<br>early on in this richard mead and i had<br>both come up with a<br>fairly similar alternative um<br>sorry opening up the student loan scheme<br>to non-students<br>in really weird emergency circumstances<br>like this<br>it seems a way of targeting things a<br>little bit more<br>more focused manner we know the<br>trade-offs always between a ubi and more<br>focused supporter that you can never<br>give quite as much as<br>to those who really need it under ubi as<br>compared to<br>more targeted aid i was wondering<br>whether you'd compared alternatives<br>like loan schemes that can be repaid and<br>then<br>mean that the government can extend a<br>lot more aid as compared to a ubi<br>i note that richards works recently<br>published yeah there's always try it<br>also be<br>between having a universal policy and<br>one that is more targeted<br>and so if you can target policies they<br>tend to be<br>more effective and cheaper but on the<br>other hand<br>having targeted policies also don't<br>always lead to the outcome that you're<br>trying to achieve<br>because you might not always be able to<br>um to target<br>so i would encourage i haven't looked at<br>any alternative policies<br>universal income is one that i think has<br>got appeals<br>on several grounds whether or not it is<br>achievable to to implement i don't know<br>but look at other policies there's other<br>automatic stabilizers that you can think<br>about<br>um that are worthwhile considering in<br>terms of the previous question about<br>whether inflation is dead<br>inflation is never dead and that's why<br>we need to keep on<br>watching out for inflation and make sure<br>that it does not come back<br>thank you very much any last questions<br>from the floor<br>i'm going to ask one brief one that's<br>come through here it's tied in with the<br>question it was asked this morning<br>the u.s stimulus package is huge the<br>current one<br>how concerned should we be about those<br>spillover macro effects in new zealand<br>um when it comes to united states<br>financial markets they really are the<br>key driver of new zealand financial<br>markets we've seen that with<br>new zealand bond rates going up quite<br>rapidly just over recent months<br>and it's very much in line with the<br>increase in<br>u.s bond rates and in turn some of that<br>is the inflation ranks that i i talked<br>about<br>in the united states so i think<br>the policy response i've got in the<br>united states um is<br>you know uh i like better heads to me um<br>have<br>um uh thought it's the correct thing to<br>do and and that's fine but they<br>just need to be uh aware that if it<br>looks like it's uh too much<br>they have to be aware that uh you know<br>at some stage to put on the brakes<br>the the federal reserve have said<br>they'll allow uh<br>inflation rates to go higher than their<br>target to sort of average things out<br>one of the questions i asked of the<br>government this morning which i didn't<br>really expect an answer but it was a<br>cheeky question<br>how much higher are central banks going<br>to be comfortable with<br>uh inflation being above target and for<br>how long we don't know<br>um and and so at some stage uh if it<br>looks like inflation is pushing a bit<br>higher um they may have to put on the<br>brakes<br>and let's leave on that note that we<br>have to be careful and overachieving<br>with our policy uh<br>impact thank you very much both of you<br>insights</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
