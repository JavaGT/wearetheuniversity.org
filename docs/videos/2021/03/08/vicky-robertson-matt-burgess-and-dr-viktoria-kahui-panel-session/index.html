happy to be sharing the stage<br>with victoria<br>uh and also vicky my abiding memory of<br>vicky was<br>at a meeting on the 14th floor of the<br>treasury seven or eight years ago<br>i think there must have been 100 people<br>in the room uh vicki was chairing the<br>meeting as deputy chief executive of the<br>treasury<br>and an unfortunate individual uh made a<br>comment that<br>did not please vicki and i remember she<br>stopped the meeting and i remember her<br>banging her pen<br>on the table when she said we will be<br>sending<br>advice that's rigorous and i thought<br>what a great speech keep making that<br>speech<br>um when i hear that word rigor we've<br>heard it a few times over the last<br>day i think of questions like what's the<br>problem<br>what's in scope what's out of scope<br>what does success look like and who's<br>accountable<br>i think those are interesting questions<br>on difficult problems like how to reduce<br>emissions<br>what i'd like to do today is try to boil<br>down the emissions problem to its<br>absolute simplest form and then talk<br>about<br>what we've received from the climate<br>change commission in its<br>report i think the overarching idea here<br>is to talk about the value of having one<br>objective and the cost of trying to do<br>too much what i find on<br>complicated issues is the value of a<br>question that cuts through all<br>the complexity and housing a good<br>question<br>is does this policy make it easier to<br>build a house<br>and i think in climate change a similar<br>question or helpful question is<br>does this policy cut emissions<br>competitively<br>and competitively is an important word<br>because we have options for how and<br>where we cut emissions<br>and we should always prefer to cut more<br>we um new zealand's head has set<br>emissions targets we've got two main<br>targets uh under the paris climate<br>agreement and a target of net zero<br>emissions in 2050<br>and of course we should meet those<br>targets because we're good international<br>citizens<br>these are net emissions targets and that<br>means uh gross emissions<br>from your car from livestock uh minus<br>removals from<br>trees for example now the beauty of<br>emissions targets<br>is that they cut through all of the<br>complexity and they boil our obligation<br>down to two numbers<br>how many tons we can emit and the date<br>it has to happen by<br>carbon dioxide is like a commodity<br>you can define it you can measure it<br>you can attach an instrument to it and<br>then you can<br>cap it and you can tax it you can trade<br>the instrument<br>to find how and where to reduce<br>emissions<br>at least cost and we should cut<br>emissions<br>at least cost because the benefit to the<br>climate<br>is independent of how and where we cut<br>emissions<br>in other words a ton of carbon is a ton<br>paying ten dollars to reduce a ton of<br>emissions<br>instead of paying one dollar lowers your<br>national income<br>by nine dollars on average<br>admissions policies vary enormously in<br>their performance<br>right now the government can take a ton<br>of carbon out of the atmosphere<br>for less than 70 in some places and<br>other places<br>it's paying more than thirty thousand<br>dollars to take a ton out<br>the consequences of that is that second<br>best emissions policies<br>are a lot worse than first best and the<br>consequence of that<br>is that allowing non-emissions<br>objectives to enter your decision<br>on how and where you cut emissions comes<br>with an enormous<br>emissions penalty and the climate change<br>commission<br>is a good example of that problem<br>so i'm going to get to their report<br>shortly but before that i want to talk<br>about the power of<br>a systems approach to reducing emissions<br>and specifically<br>the power of emissions accounting<br>and to illustrate i'm going to borrow an<br>example from the commission's<br>report the commission worries that<br>forest fires<br>mean the trees may not be a permanent<br>store of carbon<br>which is a perfectly reasonable concern<br>but imagine you have an accounting<br>system<br>that can see a fire has happened can<br>work out how many tons of emissions went<br>into the air<br>and then require compensating reductions<br>somewhere else in the economy well that<br>accounting system would mean that forest<br>fires<br>have no effect on overall emissions<br>and that would mean the climate change<br>commission doesn't have to worry about<br>forest fires in its models and its<br>recommendations<br>a good accounting system can turn<br>flammable trees<br>which aren't a permanent store of carbon<br>into<br>a much more secure way to meet our<br>targets<br>now we already have an emissions<br>accounting system<br>and it can do just that it's called the<br>emissions trading scheme<br>and it can see where when forest fires<br>happen it can work out how many tons are<br>emitted<br>and it can demand that either the forest<br>owner or someone somewhere else in the<br>economy<br>makes compensating reductions in<br>response<br>in fact the et this principle of forest<br>fire neutrality<br>uh is quite a lot more general than<br>forest fires in fact it applies right<br>across the economy<br>so one of the problems that i see in the<br>commission's whole approach<br>is that it's focused on forest fires<br>when it should be focused<br>on the accounting okay so let's<br>talk about the commission's report it<br>was released nearly five weeks ago<br>it's 847 pages long and it does two<br>things<br>it gives us emissions budgets proposes<br>emissions budgets for the next 15 years<br>and it sets out a plan for how and where<br>emissions<br>should come down all the way through to<br>2050.<br>now the commission's an advisory body<br>and this is a draft report to be<br>finalized<br>uh in the middle of the year but the<br>government's already said<br>that it's going to accept whatever the<br>commission gives it<br>so if you haven't looked at what the<br>commission's proposing you probably<br>should<br>because it's proposing fundamental<br>reforms across<br>transport energy agriculture forestry<br>public transport it wants us to walk 25<br>more and it's prepared to say that<br>cities should be reshaped to make that<br>happen<br>rod carr the chair of the commission<br>himself has said<br>the plan is much more ambitious than the<br>reforms<br>following in the 1980s and he's<br>certainly<br>right about that i believe the<br>commission<br>has made a fundamental mistake in its<br>report<br>and it's this it has chosen to pursue<br>non-emissions objectives<br>at the expense of its core task of<br>lowering emissions and we know the<br>commission's done that<br>because its analysis shows it the<br>commission says<br>that with current policies and a carbon<br>price of fifty dollars<br>new zealand gets to net zero emissions<br>in 2050.<br>but with the commission but the<br>commission wants to do a bunch of other<br>things<br>with evs and native forests and banning<br>gas connections and so on and as a<br>result the commission says we will pay<br>250 dollars for a ton of carbon<br>so think about that this way that means<br>20 of the cost of the commission's plan<br>will go to lower emissions the other<br>eighty percent<br>will go on other things and of course<br>paying five times more<br>to get to an emissions target puts that<br>let's just dwell for a moment on the<br>significance of that first finding<br>around<br>the fifty dollars for fifty dollars a<br>ton new zealand gets to net zero<br>under current policies with the existing<br>tools that we have<br>according to the commission's estimates<br>the ets price right now<br>is 39 a ton ford price is 45<br>so it's probably too much to say that<br>we're on track but it's probably fair to<br>say that we're<br>in control and we have choices<br>and that's significant because it means<br>that<br>we don't have to transform the economy<br>to meet our emissions targets<br>if we choose not to we don't have to do<br>any<br>of the commission's recommendations in<br>order to meet<br>our obligation to deliver net zero<br>emissions in 2050<br>according to their analysis we can if we<br>choose<br>so what should the commission be doing<br>i think they should be focusing on the<br>accounting strengthen the ets<br>wrap it in checks and balances to make<br>sure it's working<br>and that you can catch problems as early<br>as possible and then go as far as you<br>can<br>with the best tool that we have to<br>reduce emissions<br>the other thing is that i think the<br>commission should be much smarter about<br>what it's trying to do with<br>complementary policies alongside<br>the ets the commission proposes to<br>essentially throw<br>mud at a wall and hope everything sticks<br>in fact none of it's going to work<br>if you've kept emissions with an ets<br>other policies have no further effect<br>on emissions and that's not something<br>the commission<br>takes nearly enough account of the<br>better thing to do with complementary<br>policy is to<br>use it to target areas that are going<br>wrong when they go wrong<br>be surgical before you go abroad go as<br>far as you can with the ets<br>and then scale up policy as and when you<br>reach the limits of what the ets<br>before i um before i finish up i do need<br>to say that<br>if we're going to have a climate change<br>commission that's more focused on<br>emissions<br>that doesn't mean non-emissions issues<br>are not important<br>of course issues around particulates<br>around equity<br>trade-offs of exotics versus native<br>trees they are important issues<br>the question is who should be deciding<br>what i think the right model is that is<br>that the climate change commission<br>focuses on on emissions<br>we have a department of conservation we<br>have mpi we have a ministry of health<br>who are more than capable of dealing<br>with these complicated trade-offs<br>and it makes sense to let specialization<br>do its work<br>rather than ask a climate change<br>commission who knows a lot about climate<br>change and emissions reductions<br>to also get into health issues political<br>trade-offs on land use and so on<br>one objective means we can get to our<br>targets<br>uh responsibly safely sooner than 2050<br>if we take the shortest path<br>and we should because it's the right<br>thing to do i'll leave your three<br>takeaways<br>in conclusion first we agreed to cut<br>emissions<br>we have not agreed to drive more<br>electric vehicles<br>and there's a huge difference between<br>those two things<br>second carbon is a commodity and our<br>targets are clear<br>so how are we not taking a systems<br>approach to deliver<br>on emissions and how is ad hoc political<br>whack-a-mole<br>still on the table as an emission<br>strategy<br>and finally a systems approach doesn't<br>have to be an ets<br>but it should be because actually our<br>ets is pretty good<br>mfe has been building it for 20 years<br>they know what they're doing<br>and actually they need a bit of help<br>because the climate change commission<br>has now decided to attack the ets it<br>could use your support so<br>submissions close on the 28th of march<br>and i hope you'll all be<br>making a submission thank you<br>we could move directly to you please and<br>vicki will join us and i'm sure she'll<br>have more to add to that<br>victoria my name is victoria<br>i'm a senior lecturer at the university<br>of otago<br>in economics and i'm an academic so i<br>like slides<br>i've got a few slides here for you now<br>just to shine a bit of light on the<br>mystery of my last name it's kahui<br>i was russian born raised in germany<br>lived in england in norway and finally<br>settled in new zealand<br>and married my husband who's maori for<br>now over 20 years<br>hence the last name he's from taranaki<br>so<br>while at times i felt a little bit<br>robbed of a strong national identity<br>i've also had the the opportunity to<br>appreciate very different cultures<br>just by living around the nomadic<br>lifestyle for some time<br>and if it has taught me one thing is<br>that language matters<br>so in my economist training were<br>trained to think and speak in a certain<br>way when you talk to other people from<br>different cultures from other<br>disciplines so i work with ecologists<br>with lawyers<br>what you notice is that often you have<br>the same objectives exactly the same<br>outlook in life but you use different<br>language and there can be a barrier<br>so i've called this who owns nature's<br>tonga<br>tong as a prized possession it can be<br>anything from an object<br>to a river a place of significance<br>custom and it's interesting because the<br>word itself has a value judgment in it<br>right it's something valuable<br>now when you translate that into a<br>western scientific<br>framework then of course most of us are<br>familiar with the term of ecosystem<br>services<br>and i think especially so this is taken<br>from the millennium millennium ecosystem<br>assessment it's<br>a framework that's now wildly widely<br>used all around the world<br>and it really focuses on describing the<br>environment<br>nature in terms of the services it<br>provides<br>for our human well-being and of course<br>we felt this<br>more acutely than ever during covet 19<br>right the ability to social distance<br>right by having the space available to<br>use natural amenities to maintain our<br>well-being mental well-being but also to<br>rely<br>on the agricultural produce and give us<br>some sort of safety net in case there<br>are disruptions worldwide<br>so these are ecosystem services and they<br>feed into each other<br>seen what i think i've seen in the<br>discipline of natural resource economics<br>is that<br>the classic tragedy that we used to<br>think applies to<br>forests land um fisheries<br>is now really a tragedy of the ecosystem<br>services<br>in the sense and this is a really nice<br>example think about it you know when you<br>own a piece of land<br>you own this land so you have the<br>property right to it<br>but no one owns the wetlands ability to<br>filtrate water to provide habitat<br>so it's that lack of ownership that<br>leads to a tragedy<br>now when you think about emissions it's<br>a very similar picture<br>right so we in economics we teach as a<br>standard externality industrialization<br>leads to co2 emissions over time and<br>it's an externality because it leads to<br>global warming<br>but you could also see it as a tragedy<br>in the sense that no one owns the<br>atmosphere's capacity<br>to absorb and deal with greenhouse gases<br>it's just another<br>way of looking at it so when you think<br>about it this way<br>you then have to start thinking about<br>well how do we<br>deal with these issues with these<br>tragedies and matt has of course talked<br>about the ets that's one way right we<br>can have<br>very strong property rights and it's the<br>preferred way by a lot of economists and<br>new zealand has a very<br>good history with that especially in the<br>fisheries context so i used to be a<br>fisheries economist i used to do a lot<br>of modeling<br>looking at the property rights and<br>especially the individual transferable<br>quota system in new zealand<br>and i always say to my students when i<br>teach them i say well new zealand is the<br>least worst at managing fisheries<br>and i say this because most other<br>countries<br>are in a much worse state than we are so<br>assigning a strong property right<br>the right to fish a certain amount of a<br>certain species in a certain area in a<br>certain time<br>and be able to trade that has led to the<br>efficiency result we often want<br>right we get the most effective fissures<br>catching<br>a certain amount of fish and that's a<br>very similar kind of mechanism for the<br>ets<br>but when we set these incentives<br>we incentivize the most efficient way<br>to fish now that happens to be often for<br>deep sea species for example<br>bottom trawling bottom trolling itself<br>of course has the unintended consequence<br>that it destroys the benthic habitat<br>so here we have a classic uh tragedy of<br>the ecosystem services again<br>right so we have controlled one part of<br>the system<br>and advertedly affected another part<br>and then we have regulation and taxes so<br>these are the<br>economist toolbox this is the stuff we<br>teach our students right and<br>regulations are important they all have<br>their places so do taxes<br>and it's a no way to say we should throw<br>these away quite the opposite we should<br>embrace them<br>but we have to move on and i'd like to<br>say you know we're in the 21st century<br>we need 21st century economics not 20th<br>century<br>economics so we need to use these tools<br>but in a wider and<br>newer institutional setting so the way i<br>started thinking about this uh<br>is that i was very inspired by ostrom so<br>eleanor ostrom wants<br>nobel prize a few years ago<br>and she studied bottom-up<br>organizations around the world<br>communities that managed<br>their comments their ecosystem services<br>so to speak by themselves without any<br>government intervention<br>she came up with this framework you know<br>what made these uh institutions<br>successful<br>and that's what one had a nobel prize<br>and it's a fantastic book if anyone is<br>ever interested in reading it<br>but what struck me when i read her book<br>i was like well it was nearly like a<br>backward looking<br>sort of excise in the sense that what<br>she identified was these small<br>communities that are very you know<br>similar in their way of thinking and the<br>way of acting that they have a lot of<br>trust right<br>what we face today of course is a very<br>different<br>kind of environment and this is by the<br>recent report by the new zealand<br>parliamentary commissioner for the<br>environment<br>highlighted this more than ever so this<br>report<br>focused on estuaries right and this is a<br>little map of the<br>sorry it's a little bit fuzzy here but<br>it's a of the porirua<br>catchment area and it shows you all that<br>this is<br>i think a council uh policy person has<br>drawn this<br>senior poli policy analyst and shows you<br>all the overlapping jurisdiction<br>the different policies the multitude of<br>stakeholders<br>people who want to practice mangakai<br>versus some other<br>people who want to use the<br>estuary for access or transport<br>versus using it for affluence or<br>recreation<br>right it's these complex stakeholder<br>intervention interactions<br>um and this is really what i think the<br>frontier is now<br>how do we manage these trade-offs<br>you know just like ellen board said you<br>know you can't just put a bottom line<br>there that's not a trade-off right you<br>have to have some sort of facility<br>or some ability for stakeholders to get<br>and i was inspired when i came across<br>jacinda ruro she's a professor at the<br>university of otago and she's<br>worked on this extensively and in 2017<br>the whanganui river<br>declared itself was granted legal<br>personhood<br>so here's another language issue so when<br>i talk to my husband or others about<br>this they immediately feel like well how<br>you know what do you mean by legal<br>person so if you look at that concept<br>legal personhood it applies to humans<br>humans are legal persons<br>but they're also non-human entities<br>namely the corporation<br>right the firm the corporation is a<br>legal entity<br>it can enter a contract can own property<br>it can incur debt it can be<br>sued it can sue right and it took<br>sense medieval times for that idea to<br>really evolve and<br>be accepted and that's led to one of the<br>most wealth creating<br>structures that we know so when i read<br>about this<br>you know the whanganui river which was<br>recognized as an indivisible living hole<br>comprising<br>the whanganui from the mountains to the<br>sea<br>incorporating all these physical<br>metaphysical elements<br>i was a little bit inspired i thought<br>wow so here we have a new institutional<br>arrangement<br>and the way it works and this is<br>something that i'm<br>currently a little bit looking into and<br>i'm keen to actually<br>engage with some of the people involved<br>when this was created<br>is that it has a human face right so the<br>human face is represented by<br>whanganui evie the crown as well as an<br>advisory group and that advisory group<br>is made up<br>of recreational fishers of genesis of<br>any one or the council<br>anyone who has a stake or some<br>utilization interest in that river and<br>the explicit aim is to act<br>collaboratively<br>right it is to actually sit down the<br>table<br>and come to these trade-offs<br>now in the legislation this is my last<br>slide for you today<br>it very clearly states that<br>the overarching aim is to preserve the<br>intrinsic value of the river now this is<br>something that economists really<br>struggle with<br>right i mean as an environmental<br>economics economist we teach<br>our students total economic value you<br>know use and non-use values<br>it's always this very strong<br>anthropocentric worldview<br>so here we have an intrinsic value an<br>inherent value<br>and what we've seen when we actually<br>when you look at the valuation<br>literature and you ask people you go out<br>and say what are you willing to pay to<br>preserve this<br>particular natural entity what you find<br>is people do put some willingness to pay<br>on intrinsic value<br>right it's it's a it's a strange or<br>unexpected result<br>but here we have teo maori right some<br>ancient knowledge some mataranga maori<br>that can inform<br>what we may need for 21st century policy<br>making<br>so the interesting bit here about if<br>you've followed this presentation is<br>about property rights right so we've<br>gone from<br>um no one owns something leading to a<br>tragedy<br>to very strong property rights in terms<br>of credibility<br>and here we have now a property right<br>that's vested<br>in the resource itself and this this is<br>something i struggled with right<br>it made me really think i was like what<br>does that mean<br>it's something vested in the resource<br>itself it's its own entity<br>and we have these stakeholders around it<br>who are able to negotiate<br>and this is when i have now come across<br>my well i've always<br>thought coast was one of the most<br>impressive<br>economists even nearly notching above<br>adam smith but<br>kos was brilliant if you read some of<br>his work<br>he was talking about transaction costs<br>right<br>transaction costs matter because they<br>inform what institutions and what type<br>of institutions are forming<br>so new institutional economics for<br>example would say<br>if the transaction costs of a particular<br>way of being become so high<br>that they're unworkable we switch to a<br>new institutional arrangement<br>i'm not saying we all need to think<br>about legal personhood or environmental<br>person for in<br>natural systems but what i'm saying is<br>we need to think about new institutional<br>arrangements if we're thinking about<br>transaction costs<br>and i think ellen board mentioned well<br>sorry ellen ballard mentioned we should<br>well there's some thinking about<br>aggregation maybe that is the first step<br>to it<br>right but what we want to do and this is<br>interesting there's um<br>an academic julia talbot jones who did<br>her thesis on the<br>some of these transaction costs she used<br>a little game theory experiment to see<br>whether they<br>increase or decrease and of course when<br>you move to a new institutional<br>arrangement<br>transaction costs increase right for<br>quite clearly you have to implement the<br>new system you have to renegotiate<br>water usage rights let's say<br>but what struck me as interesting is the<br>whanganui evie had gone to court<br>for centuries trying to um get their<br>right to be heard<br>and that when you look back at codes is<br>also a transaction cost<br>it's about delineating defining and<br>capturing a property right<br>right because it's the when transaction<br>costs are high this is when the<br>negotiation fails right so<br>when you take that into account um it<br>kind of inspired me to think well is<br>this not something we actually see in<br>this current climate change<br>movement right we see the generation<br>zero we see<br>young people who are really arguing on<br>behalf<br>of the resource of our natural systems<br>as a way<br>to create resilience in terms of climate<br>change right but they have no voice<br>there's no property right for them right<br>so is it their way of arguing behalf of<br>that system<br>and we need to get them as a stakeholder<br>on the table<br>maybe this is a way forward but i think<br>i would like to leave you with this is<br>we need 21 uh 21st century economics to<br>deal with 21st century problems<br>so we need to think about new<br>institutions and the way we can make<br>them work effectively<br>thanks very much victoria and uh we've<br>got vicky all good to go i think vikki<br>are you<br>great great to have you with us we'll<br>let you get um straight into your<br>robertson<br>so i'm the secretary for the environment<br>my name is mcgee robertson<br>i didn't hear you matt uh initially so<br>um you're telling stories from our times<br>together<br>a few years ago i'm sure and i didn't<br>hear all of your<br>conversation around the climate<br>commission's budgets but i can imagine<br>um some of the flavour of that i find<br>myself agreeing both with<br>you and victoria and i suppose the<br>question i posed today for the audience<br>is how do you<br>how might we have an economy that works<br>for people damn planet<br>i came as matt indicated from treasury<br>and trotted across the road to the<br>ministry of the environment<br>uh some six years ago now and i have to<br>tell you i was<br>uh probably a little naive to the<br>degradation of our environment<br>and our environment report in 2019<br>points out nine<br>areas that are top priorities where not<br>only is our environment degrading<br>but the trend is uh not good and i<br>suppose i was<br>a little bit shocked by that uh and a<br>little bit um<br>in the frame of well if we you know if<br>we leave the market or we<br>leave private citizens to work out what<br>they need to do then they will do what<br>is necessary and i think i've learned<br>that<br>that is that is um we are building on<br>that kind of thinking to<br>to new ways of thinking like you say<br>victoria<br>and and also learning from old ways of<br>thinking so talk a little bit about that<br>but the evidence on<br>on new zealand's environment is not good<br>and i<br>implore you to go and have a look at our<br>um our own data on that<br>the thing that i think is important<br>about that is our whole economic<br>prosperity relies<br>what a lot of it does a lot relies on<br>our natural environment<br>so the nexus between the economy and the<br>environment is really strong in new<br>zealand<br>as is i think uh more so now the nexus<br>we're seeing between<br>people well-being and and the<br>environment and being able to get out in<br>nature<br>and have access to nature and<br>in that way as well we saw that through<br>covert so the evidence isn't good so<br>uh probably we need different ways of uh<br>thinking about things from here if<br>otherwise you know we will<br>continue to degrade what we rely on as<br>people<br>and the other part that kind of has has<br>changed for me<br>and my own thinking is just we did<br>behave as if<br>the environment and the economy were<br>separate things and the<br>classical economics would say uh<br>you know the environment is an<br>externality and uh we'll deal with it in<br>that way and i think we've moved<br>um in new zealand and also around the<br>world to<br>to realizing that's probably not quite<br>the way that that we might uh deal with<br>complexity of these issues going forward<br>uh maori of course and indigenous people<br>uh<br>have known this for for centuries and<br>the interconnectedness and<br>interrelationship between uh living and<br>non-living things has been part of the<br>way that they think about things and you<br>see that<br>uh coming through in some of the ways<br>maori businesses are<br>thinking about their own plans uh uh in<br>that connection<br>our own parliamentary commissioner for<br>the environment um<br>he said recently it's no longer<br>reasonable or credible<br>to organize our economy and society on a<br>basis that regards natural capital<br>as infinitely substitutable and i think<br>there's something really important in<br>that<br>um so that uh substitutability uh<br>pieces is quite clear i think the other<br>part i would say about this which i<br>think has been very<br>important for our centers in our role is<br>that<br>action or change on the ground today<br>isn't seen<br>until uh a long time in the future both<br>negative and positive so the<br>intergenerational<br>benefits and costs are really important<br>in thinking about any change<br>that we make to environmental outcomes<br>and the impact on the economy at the<br>moment<br>and at the moment i know matt you talked<br>about the climate commissions<br>you know one of the critical things for<br>us is to understand what that long term<br>both benefits and costs uh to to those<br>pathways<br>and not just the short-term costs to our<br>current<br>generations and i think that's really<br>important<br>um so uh the challenge we've got as a<br>goal<br>is really how do we move to where we<br>have<br>the economy the environment uh we'll<br>together uh and we<br>reverse not just do less degradation but<br>because nature has a really<br>role play in our economic prosperity it<br>has value for its sake and victoria<br>talked about the intrinsic value of<br>nature<br>in our fresh water reforms last year<br>there is a hierarchy<br>around how we think about fresh water<br>now in new zealand<br>protocol is back to the hour uh back to<br>the river<br>and the purposes and then economic<br>purposes<br>so that hierarchy made it in<br>our national policy statement and how we<br>will think about water from here on in<br>so we've got the the beginnings and the<br>building<br>things of some different thinking some<br>different ways of approaching that nick<br>victoria uh which<br>i sit on that that group that you talked<br>about<br>so there's something emerging here in<br>new zealand that we can build on<br>i think the the energy<br>piece really takes us into a way<br>probably my<br>my breeding ground and treasure<br>theory which was really strongly you<br>think 21st century tools as you talked<br>about victoria and<br>probably a multi-point about ets<br>uh and it recognizes that you know<br>things are complex and are connected<br>uh and actually you have to deal with<br>that complexity<br>uh and the dynamic uh efficiency if you<br>like in an economic sense um<br>but also the intergenerational so what<br>is the impacts in the long term<br>uh i think uh that is emerging<br>globally so mariana matsukatsu we have<br>done so with at the moment i'm really<br>interested in her thinking and she's<br>them<br>well governments are already involved in<br>a whole lot of uh investment<br>and i think she challenges uh how you<br>might achieve that dynamic change<br>over time and really uh<br>challenges the underlying theory of that<br>in the public value and the government's<br>role in creating<br>a bit more for the environment and over<br>time<br>um there's a real opportunity i think as<br>i said for new zealand uh<br>of course there are as victoria said we<br>build on uh existing uh toolbox and<br>economic toolbox you know probably have<br>an important role<br>to play but they are really pricing the<br>bads<br>um and they won't by itself uh really<br>affect the system change that<br>that we think is required in terms of<br>their economic environmental degradation<br>quite a blunt tool uh for example<br>sweden's had a really high price on<br>carbon for decades<br>over us a hundred dollars but their<br>electoral vehicle market share is under<br>10<br>uh norway's by comparison has a problem<br>a success with ev market share of new<br>vehicles nearly at 50 percent<br>and and they put in uh because of key<br>policies around evs<br>being cheaper to buy than than isis so<br>i suppose in summary of that is i think<br>it's a mix of tools<br>the ets will only get us so far and<br>probably the pace and timing of change<br>and just using one tool um is not going<br>to be effective<br>uh i think creating effective<br>institutions is really important<br>uh victoria uh and changing expectations<br>about what they might deliver<br>for example um as an example of the way<br>firms are bringing in<br>uh climate risk you know that we have<br>moving to mandatory<br>disclosure of climate related uh<br>financial risks for<br>firms uh something that um you know<br>climate change has been considered<br>something that government does well this<br>is coming on to<br>um onto firm's own<br>own books and also within their<br>boardrooms so<br>changing changing directly changing<br>private investment behavior<br>the the new zealand green investment<br>fund was established to play a role<br>modelling um mobilizing some of the<br>private sector financing<br>uh into low<br>emissions solutions are recognising that<br>uh if you just left it to a short-term<br>market-based approach that firms will<br>will probably never invest in the things<br>that we need to get us on the path to a<br>low-emissions future<br>and you know the climate commission<br>itself is an institution that is set up<br>to provide<br>independent uh advice based on<br>um you know the science uh it has<br>uh you know it's a uk based model so<br>it's independent from<br>from us and we now are once they<br>once they give their advice we will be<br>um providing advice the government on<br>on the pathways that they have<br>recommended the thing that's different<br>in that in an institutional sense<br>and this is this is important too is<br>under the legislation the government<br>can't say thanks very much for your<br>advice climate commission<br>uh uh we'll ignore that and and do<br>something else they have to come up with<br>a plan<br>and that recognises that there isn't uh<br>you know we can do nothing here<br>uh there is there needs to be a pathway<br>uh set out for everybody in the economy<br>uh to look over the uh you know<br>five-year budget<br>and that gives investors certainty and<br>and to um<br>to allow what to to see for us all to<br>see what that pathway might look like<br>um so that those are some examples of<br>how changes in the institutions have<br>happened<br>um so in summary um i think uh<br>new tools in the toolbox uh is important<br>uh i think new zealand has a unique<br>opportunity uh with maori and<br>indigenous ways of thinking and already<br>different ways of<br>setting up how we think about the<br>connection between nature and the<br>economy<br>that we can actually find ways that that<br>works for us<br>uh you know with an economy that relies<br>very heavily<br>on nature and a people that relies very<br>heavily on nature then we<br>we are um you know there's a<br>responsibility on all of us to think uh<br>outside the square here uh a way of um<br>uh making sure that is there for future<br>generations<br>uh thanks so much vicky for joining us<br>online we lost you a wee bit in in the<br>middle there<br>um so the the it wasn't quite perfect<br>i'm sorry it's a good reminder just how<br>important infrastructure is including um<br>uh including infrastructure that<br>facilitates us communicating<br>across long distances great perspectives<br>there some differences some overlaps and<br>similarities and perspectives new ways<br>of thinking yes but matt will remind us<br>let's uh<br>also make sure that people use their<br>comparative advantage or organizations<br>use their comparative advantage<br>uh do we have any questions from the<br>okay let me um move to a<br>question for all three of you please and<br>hopefully vicki can hear us<br>could join in if she has a response as<br>well<br>how should we manage the trade-off<br>between necessary<br>infrastructure development and the<br>environment so that follows on very<br>nicely from alan's<br>presentation<br>we should price carbon well that's a<br>nice simple answer matt<br>we should do it competently and uh on a<br>level playing field<br>uh and as cheaply and as efficiently as<br>possible<br>thanks nice and simple vicky did you if<br>we still got vikki with us<br>yeah vicky what do you think any<br>response<br>yes<br>matt uh so a think about<br>prioritizing that towards a<br>low emissions feature so is that built<br>into the decision making um<br>from my from where i sit<br>uh infrastructure actually deliver<br>better um<br>emissions reductions then<br>thanks vicky victoria any comments i i<br>fully agree with matt<br>good okay another question for all of<br>our panelists are there examples of ets<br>programs leading to significant carbon<br>reductions<br>yes there are please i would disagree<br>so this is something we've discussed in<br>the car so um<br>it's not my research area i might have<br>missed it but from when i was in europe<br>i got the distinct impression that most<br>carbon markets didn't work so well<br>precisely because there was always that<br>in<br>well you know often the cap was set way<br>too high<br>or it was enforced in ways that allowed<br>people to do things that didn't actually<br>lead to carbon emissions<br>reductions and one prime example i've<br>mentioned was<br>in new zealand purchasing dodgy<br>carbon credits from the ukraine to meet<br>our targets for quite some time after<br>the eu<br>had decided that that was not a viable<br>way of going<br>so i've made the point that we really<br>when we want to<br>introduce an ets we need a really stable<br>secure institution that is willing to<br>actually<br>set a lower cap and really stick with it<br>and send the right signals to<br>investors because if they start<br>investing and and then and the<br>government keeps changing its um<br>you know its tack on it or its<br>regulations that is too much uncertainty<br>and i've seen that in the idq system<br>where the government has done it and<br>it's worked really well right it's<br>anchored in the legislation you can take<br>your mortgage out on your quota<br>so that's provide very strong signals<br>yeah completely agree so<br>look um the ukrainian credits debacle<br>um you know it should be seen for what<br>it was um<br>a serious problem but not a fundamental<br>problem that can't be avoided next time<br>i absolutely agree it all hinges on<br>quality of institutions um<br>nobody can have confidence in a system<br>that's um printing fake credits and<br>pretending that means something<br>there is evidence on the evidence of ets<br>the first thing to say is that<br>it's hard to see decentralized systems<br>work right all the<br>changes and emissions reductions occur<br>in places that you can't see that's how<br>prices work<br>there are stuff there's two things i'd<br>say there's studies from overseas uh<br>prices have gone up a lot here in new<br>zealand and overseas<br>um over the last five years that's had<br>real consequences on the ground<br>overseas studies make very clear um that<br>even at quite low prices<br>um there's been a real effect uh in the<br>uk<br>britain's electricity sector uh 55<br>reduction in emissions<br>uh from their electricity sector over<br>five years to 2018<br>mostly from coal to gas conversions uh<br>and generation plants<br>more than half of that was due to an ets<br>according to a study that came out just<br>before christmas<br>here in new zealand when you talk to<br>energy companies and others that are<br>exposed to a carbon price they all say<br>to you<br>we are absolutely making different<br>decisions on on the back of the<br>higher costs that we're facing to burn<br>coal one final point<br>at 39 a tonne of coal the price of a ton<br>of coal is nearly doubled<br>by the uts right that hurts natural gas<br>up 25 to 30 percent um similarly<br>important and the other direction<br>consequences in forestry so it may not<br>have a major effect on the price of<br>petrol<br>but don't don't let that um<br>don't that doesn't mean that it's not<br>having a big effect um<br>elsewhere so the prices are working the<br>markets are working<br>and vicki if you're with us if if we<br>could draw you in on this as well and<br>there was a specific question for you<br>what's your view on matt's argument that<br>we should treat this as a market<br>um<br>so i we we would say that you need more<br>than the ets<br>that um uh for a number of reasons<br>um one of which is the distributional<br>impacts<br>of of having uh just a pricing mechanism<br>uh the second is uh the speed uh<br>of change uh so we would we would argue<br>that you need complementary measures in<br>place<br>uh and that um yeah you can't just rely<br>on price<br>to to affect the change that that's<br>required over the time<br>can i respond sure can i ask vicki um<br>your view<br>i mean um do you agree that we should be<br>checking<br>the effectiveness of everything we're<br>doing ets complementary policies<br>and be prepared to stop doing what's not<br>effective and do more of what<br>is effective um i i do agree<br>and i think there is a sufficiency<br>question<br>jim in everything that we do so<br>what what is going to take us towards<br>lo actually lowering emissions uh as you<br>i think have pointed out<br>uh and what are the you know so i think<br>there is offer<br>and decisions made that are very short<br>term to do something that actually<br>doesn't<br>necessarily lo you know would have a<br>different alternative or a different<br>policy<br>uh that we might put in place um that<br>gets us towards lower emissions and<br>i think tran transport's the hardest one<br>right you know there is a behavioral<br>change and transport that is required<br>and the question is how do you affect<br>that<br>new zealand's one of the highest in the<br>oecd in terms of our transport emissions<br>and they're growing<br>we love our cars so i think there's a um<br>there's a question about between the<br>different policy options that you've got<br>what is the best<br>and the most efficiency you know what's<br>going to work the best in terms of<br>changing behavior about our uh our move<br>out of um out of petrol vehicles<br>basically<br>so the short answer is yes but i<br>wouldn't rely on a price tool<br>only and there's an associated question<br>on transport that's come through from<br>online<br>is increasing the number of electric<br>vehicles or reducing emissions what<br>we're targeting<br>are electric vehicles a public policy<br>aim in their own right<br>so vicky i don't know if you want to<br>jump back in and make any response on<br>that one<br>yeah i think um one of the things the<br>commission has done uh<br>is point out that the the to to actually<br>get<br>a lower emissions profile and in<br>transport<br>we actually have to change the way that<br>we travel<br>and so thinking about uh mobility and<br>and also i'm not sure you know how<br>cities are designed<br>so they do talk about um<br>increasing other other mobility so<br>cycling walking is probably a pathway<br>towards<br>different ways of traveling thanks<br>i i would just you know i think we're<br>sort of um<br>there's two objective functions in here<br>and i just<br>i guess um say that you know if you're<br>solving for lower emissions<br>you've got to choose between solving for<br>emissions or solving for transport<br>emissions and<br>if you're doing one you're not doing the<br>other and so<br>in the end the text of our agreement<br>says we've made a commitment to lower<br>emissions<br>we have to be aware i think and i say<br>this humbly that if<br>we are going to decide that we want to<br>pursue lower transport emissions per se<br>which is what i think vicky just said<br>that is it at the expense<br>or makes it harder to get to net zero<br>because you're eliminating competition<br>you're closing off the options and<br>forcing emissions through this channel<br>now that's fine if it turns out<br>transport is or will become<br>um a competitive source of emissions<br>reductions as vicky said right now it's<br>actually pretty hard<br>um evs are getting much more competitive<br>in the future but right now that's hard<br>and um in the end if you want to insist<br>on forcing emissions reductions<br>through transport today uh it makes it<br>harder<br>to get to what we said we do which is<br>eric do you want to go ahead great i've<br>got a couple questions<br>uh one is a follow-on for um<br>ministry for the environment vicky there<br>completely take the point on equity<br>issues<br>it would seem a second best though to<br>try and approach equity issues by<br>jolting things around in the ets or<br>addressing complementary<br>measures when there are first best<br>alternatives available the government<br>auctions nzu<br>they get money when the auction has it<br>and said you you could take the pot of<br>money<br>divided by five million people send<br>everybody a check at the end of the year<br>as a carbon dividend<br>that will almost certainly be a<br>progressive transfer because rich people<br>spend money more money on everything<br>carbon is in everything<br>so this will turn into something that<br>would reinforce the system<br>i worry that the complementary measures<br>that you seem to be endorsing<br>and that rod car certainly is endorsing<br>will break the system make it<br>politically fragile<br>and make it way harder for us to get<br>there have you done any work<br>looking at potential equity potential<br>use of carbon dividends<br>in addressing equity and embedding the<br>ets and i'll save my other one for<br>victoria which<br>later<br>i'm not sure whether vicky heard that<br>question<br>uh there it might be one that we need to<br>leave till later she's disappearing on<br>on us do you want if i jump in yeah<br>please go go ahead okay<br>this is something you hear often that<br>the uts has just preferred<br>distributional outcomes and we have to<br>worry of course we have to worry about<br>that<br>but i do have a question of you know<br>what how distributionally advantageous<br>does policy have to be<br>to make up for a five or ten or fifty<br>fold um deficit in terms of the cost<br>the number of dollars you have to spend<br>to achieve a given amount of reductions<br>wouldn't it just be cheaper to go for<br>the one dollar option and then use some<br>of the<br>the savings and hopefully a small amount<br>to fix whatever<br>the most affordable option broke you've<br>got to remember that you know<br>an affordable way to cut carbon is<br>affordable for a reason it's because<br>it does the least disruption it consumes<br>the least resources<br>and so you wouldn't normally anticipate<br>that to be particularly<br>distributionally disadvantageous if that<br>makes sense uh and i'm not sure it's<br>ever been demonstrated that<br>the ets is worse in distribution terms<br>but even if it is um we can still use it<br>if it's the most effective way<br>to do things and have um adjusting<br>policies on the side<br>that make up for whatever problems the<br>et has created we don't have to do this<br>separate approach of giving up our best<br>tool on a theoretical argument because<br>that's all it is<br>that um policy can do a better job on<br>distribution<br>i don't know that much about ets but i<br>can draw on the fisheries example and<br>when new zealand and 80s<br>early 90s adopted the i2q system it had<br>huge distributional impacts but new<br>zealand was quite<br>open-minded to them and said well we'll<br>just throw the chips and see how they<br>lie and they didn't<br>redistribute and over time what we saw<br>was a real<br>change in or an unanticipated change in<br>how these quota were distribute<br>redistribute so we saw a huge<br>concentration of quota<br>in the most efficient hands which are<br>typically big corporations away from<br>local fishermen<br>and that's why most other countries in<br>the world have some sort of restrictions<br>on the tradability of these rights<br>precisely for that reason<br>they want to preserve some of their<br>their local fisheries tradition in for<br>example norwegian<br>coast they want to make sure that local<br>employment<br>is sustained and while the etas<br>is arguably quite different to fisheries<br>in in in some sense it's very similar<br>because what you're doing is you're<br>allocating rights and<br>yes you get the more effect most<br>effective reduction in<br>your co2 missions this is what you want<br>but it will have an effect on<br>um winners or losers and that's always<br>the case and then you have to really<br>start thinking about<br>is this something or what is it how do<br>we want to deal with that<br>and i think you can use systems to<br>protect the things you care about it's<br>not just<br>dollars and tons of you know there are<br>interests there are<br>all kinds of interests that can be<br>recognized in a system that gives<br>credible permanent<br>enduring protection um to the things we<br>care about it's not just dollars and<br>tons it's you know<br>there are human factors in there that<br>can be brought in<br>and it's great because if it's in a<br>system it's not subject to the whims<br>of the next government or the next<br>election or whatever<br>you have security thanks and i guess<br>we'll move on to another question we<br>have lost vicky i'm sorry so we'll just<br>address this question to the two but i<br>think i think probably victoria you<br>might make the first response on this<br>question<br>how do maori aspirations fit with the<br>climate change<br>climate commission's proposals and then<br>well what struck me as in<br>i mean this is probably one of the most<br>pervasive arguments for me<br>for looking at some maori values is that<br>they really care about future<br>generations<br>they're really focusing on what we<br>request<br>what we pass on to future generations<br>and<br>it's a really central way of thinking<br>and you know climate change<br>is all about that because we're now<br>realizing that whatever impact<br>whatever we do now has some impact<br>further down the line for our children<br>or for even if we don't children have<br>children the future generations our<br>species<br>and it's a really important concept that<br>i think um<br>maori are very good at addressing and<br>we're starting to get good at this right<br>i mean i think<br>it's coming out at a forefront of our<br>thinking<br>but it's been always there with with<br>some and the maori way of looking at the<br>world and i think that's something we<br>really need to take on board right what<br>we're doing now<br>um is having a huge impact and we need<br>to be very careful about that<br>uh at the risk of oversimplifying<br>everything i just have this view that in<br>the end<br>everybody wins when you're achieving a<br>given goal<br>for the smallest commitment of resources<br>for the least risk with the most<br>certainty and so on<br>and that you're doing it in a way that<br>isn't subject to you know what sort of<br>being a particular official in a<br>particular department<br>got out of this morning um so<br>i would just say that i think everybody<br>wins<br>all of the everything's better when<br>you're doing things in an organized<br>clearway<br>thanks there any last questions from the<br>floor<br>otherwise i'm going to ask one more of<br>our online questions before we break for<br>lunch<br>um who should be judging the merits of<br>different climate change mitigation<br>options isn't that central planning<br>overreach i might have an idea of what<br>matt's response on this is but<br>um i who would like to start on that<br>you could start on this i have to think<br>about it<br>well look i think you know touches on<br>the question what's the decision what<br>are the decisions we want government<br>doing and what are the decisions we want<br>um<br>businesses and households making and so<br>in the end<br>you know the discussion we've had today<br>with vicki um i think<br>is has been the question of um<br>uh do we want government doing just the<br>accounting or do we want the government<br>choosing between different technologies<br>and different sectors governments are<br>really good<br>at accounting systems in all forms<br>including our ets but<br>um all over the place budget the<br>government budget systems and so on<br>governments are demonstrably measurably<br>bad and persistently<br>on really complicated questions um like<br>technology and it's not because<br>you know any all intent not lack of<br>competence<br>it's just hard to make those judgments<br>from the center and to the extent<br>possible you want to leave a thousand<br>flowers bloom you want a million<br>decision makers<br>making those trade-offs not a hundred um<br>in wellington somewhere<br>so um you want to you know the reason<br>the commission<br>uh is building these enormously<br>complicated models very difficult to us<br>they're doing<br>you know they've got a competent team in<br>there they're working hard we can see<br>that<br>but in the end the reason it's so hard<br>for them is because they're doing the<br>wrong job<br>they're taking on a job that really<br>should be in the hands of households and<br>businesses for them to decide<br>how much more they love their v8 how<br>much versus their gas heater<br>that's their you know they know that a<br>lot better than well-meaning officials<br>in wellington<br>so ask the government to do the<br>accounting and do it really well and<br>make and do their homework to make sure<br>it's working<br>step in if it's not um and otherwise<br>trust households and businesses<br>to understand their preferences and that<br>what you'll find is<br>um it gets a whole lot easier to get to<br>our origins target<br>great nice simple response as as always<br>victoria i've i've been kind i was<br>thinking about that question<br>let the science do the talking i mean<br>what we've seen is a massive decline in<br>in natural degradation of our waterways<br>and many other ecosystem services<br>and we're measuring this we're<br>monitoring this and in fact the report<br>new zealand parliamentary report um<br>really focused on monitoring<br>right not only let's manage this as a<br>single identity but also monitor it<br>so it's a bit like let's try and do<br>things<br>and see what happens right if if we<br>start<br>i mean a lot of it is very common sense<br>but if we start<br>replanting native vegetation that's much<br>better at co2 absorption we know that a<br>lot of that goes through on the riparian<br>right so if we start doing that and we<br>see a massive improvement in water<br>quality<br>that's a good thing so we need science<br>science is absolutely crucial<br>we need that monitoring that baseline to<br>see where we started and where we go<br>and i think i mean it may not be always<br>the best way the most effective way but<br>we are in some way fumbling our ways<br>through this<br>and what economics has to offer is that<br>it's not the end and all but it gives<br>you some way of thinking about things<br>in a more effective way how can we have<br>a win-win that's what we all want right<br>how can we do the things the right<br>things in the most efficient way<br>and how can we approach these<br>stakeholder trade-offs with the least<br>cost possible that that is really the<br>mantra of all economic thought<br>and it underpinning it should be a safe<br>sound science level right and some good<br>work showing that we're going in the<br>right direction<br>thanks very much and that response<br>reminded me of some of the discussions<br>yesterday on covert we're yeah we need<br>the good science but we probably also<br>need some good economics thrown in there<br>as well to help those<br>um make those trade-offs really clear<br>what we're doing<br>so with that i'm going to close this uh<br>panel it's been an<br>excellent panel hasn't it lots of<br>insight sorry about the little tech<br>catchers with with vicki there but uh<br>thanks for being with us<br>and thanks very much for our in-person<br>uh panelists and to vicky thanks very<br>much for joining us as well</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
