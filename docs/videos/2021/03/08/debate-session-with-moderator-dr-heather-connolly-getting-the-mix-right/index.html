may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>welcome everybody both hear those in the<br>room and also those that are online this<br>afternoon<br>today's debate and i think more it's a<br>conversation i think we've debated a lot<br>we all agree that we can have varying<br>views<br>but today's debate slash conversation is<br>getting the right mix the mix between<br>the monetary policy the fiscal policy<br>and we've heard a lot about<br>the well-being of of the nation and i<br>have the honour of hosting this with<br>three<br>very well acclaimed economists who i<br>know will enlighten us with their views<br>they may agree and they may agree to<br>disagree<br>and how we can move for me the<br>importance of moving the economy forward<br>so i'd like to welcome sitting here<br>directly here<br>paul daisel and he's a professor of<br>economics and the deputy director of<br>agri-business and economics research<br>unit at lincoln university<br>and he is an astounding over a hundred<br>refereed publications books and chapters<br>on economic policy issues so he knows<br>a lot more than i do um just sitting to<br>his left we have the wonderful dr<br>eric crampton who is well known through<br>his columns<br>his commentary which appear regularly in<br>new zealand's major media outlets<br>and his work with the new zealand<br>initiative<br>and finally on the far side cameron<br>baghery<br>who's been actively involved with<br>economics for over 20 years<br>and is definitely not shying away from<br>any a direct approach to discuss<br>trends challenges and the issues that<br>affect<br>new zealand business so what i did was i<br>contacted the gentleman earlier this<br>week and i said you know what i'm going<br>to give you five minutes<br>and you can go for it and i think that's<br>going to be a really start<br>us and also our colleagues online<br>to think about the questions we want<br>them to debate<br>because this isn't about me asking them<br>the questions this is about getting<br>their viewpoints<br>which may help us and may help those<br>policy makers in wellington<br>come up with the right ways that we can<br>actually get that mix moving forward<br>so i'm actually um going to allow us to<br>ask<br>lots of questions so i'm going to pass<br>over to eric first<br>sitting there in the middle and i'm<br>going to get him to start with his<br>viewpoint<br>great thanks so much it's going to be a<br>lot of fun i really enjoyed uh john's<br>talk earlier and i hope that i don't<br>reprise too many of the kinds of themes<br>that he was bringing up<br>uh with the remit as broad as we've had<br>i usually take it as an opportunity to<br>just talk about whatever the heck i want<br>and i hope i don't abuse that too much<br>if we look back over the past year i'm<br>reminded a lot of an episode of mash<br>i think it was a pilot episode i don't<br>know if nash really picked up in new<br>zealand as much as it did<br>in canada when i was a kid we saw it all<br>on reruns rise of an age when it's in<br>reruns<br>and the pilot there's this great bit<br>where hawkeye is writing home and<br>talking about the difference in surgery<br>uh there at the mobile army surgical<br>hospital<br>where they're having to triage and back<br>home where they'd be in the doctor's<br>office or in the proper surgery and he<br>called it meatball surgery<br>if you spend the time to do the pretty<br>sutures and to do everything right so<br>that you save the patient and you save<br>the leg<br>the patient on the next gurney dies<br>right so they do meatball surgery you<br>save the patient<br>you chop off the leg and you save the<br>next guy too<br>if we look back a year ago we were<br>moving into meatball surgery phase<br>right now a year ago i was terrified<br>that we the response wasn't there yet<br>and i was really starting to freak out<br>i'd already<br>done all of my emergency kit and<br>lockdown was still three weeks away<br>but policy caught up pretty quick and<br>did some pretty remarkable<br>meatball surgery if you think about it<br>the wage subsidy scheme<br>it's not quite what you do if you'd have<br>like all the time in the world to think<br>about it we'd been suggesting<br>modeling it on germany's a short time<br>wage scheme<br>where if workers spend a little bit less<br>time at the office they move to play on<br>to like an 80<br>contract rather than 100 in response to<br>the demand shift<br>government picks up some of the<br>difference in the wage bill we thought<br>that might be a little bit cleaner<br>that's what we've been advocating for<br>but<br>geez you cannot fault them for having<br>gotten that kind of work done in a hurry<br>fantastic meatball surgery getting a<br>border system running kind of cobbled<br>together<br>shunting things around so that hotels<br>can be quasi quarantine facilities<br>good meatball surgery bad approach for<br>the long term and that's sort of the<br>problem that we've got going forward<br>that we haven't really shifted from<br>meatball surgery<br>to a more business as usual approach<br>setting the kinds of systems that can<br>see us through the longer period<br>i'm terrified about it for the border<br>system we are taking too many risks<br>which means that we're<br>accommodating far too little travel<br>compared to what we could be doing<br>under a better border system the<br>ministry of health seems impervious<br>to any kind of suggestions for<br>improvement and<br>in fact the government seems to just put<br>their fingers in their ears if you<br>suggest<br>anything could be fixed because it<br>implies that something isn't going well<br>so there's a problem there we didn't<br>shift out of the kind of meatball<br>surgery version of the wage subsidy<br>scheme into something that might<br>withstand<br>future lockdowns come august after the<br>first lockdown<br>wellington had turned back to normal<br>business as usual they're running<br>crazy consultation processes on things<br>that really weren't all that important<br>and did not come up with a better fit<br>for purpose model for<br>repeated weird little lockdowns that we<br>might be getting and they still didn't<br>improve the border system<br>initially we thought there's going to be<br>mass unemployment everybody was thinking<br>the world was going to go to fire<br>they set up this trouble ready job<br>scheme which never really made that much<br>sense but if the whole object was to<br>avoid mass unemployment well maybe<br>they didn't reverse course when we saw<br>that the bottom didn't fall out of the<br>labor market right<br>like it didn't make that much sense to<br>start with they didn't reverse course<br>we're still in that meatball surgery<br>i wonder though whether it hasn't always<br>been thus there's always been a bit of<br>that meatball approach here we've got<br>some great<br>underlying institutions but the<br>day-to-day policy that comes out<br>it's kind of shocking right so if we<br>think to the well-being approach<br>i'm going back to one of the things that<br>i'm supposed to be talking about this<br>started<br>ages ago it's not new to this government<br>there was<br>a way of trying to measure it and<br>evaluate policy for its effectiveness<br>and well-being<br>the shift to the well-being budgets of<br>the current government and then onwards<br>came with an abandoning of rigor they<br>stopped measuring effectiveness<br>when i put in an oia request to find out<br>whether there was any attempt at<br>frameworks for evaluating the mental<br>health spend in the first big well-being<br>budget because they said<br>this matters a lot for well-being they<br>hadn't even started thinking about<br>evaluation<br>right they just knew that well people<br>with mental health issues<br>they're hurting so we're going to throw<br>some money at them that's not a good<br>approach for sound policy<br>land use planning we're seeing a lot of<br>the consequences of it now<br>with covid the monetary inflation that<br>we've had has been feeding through into<br>asset prices<br>it's exacerbating a lot of issues we<br>keep seeing meatball surgery approaches<br>where we have well let's have this one<br>little bolt-on<br>attempt to try and restrict demand<br>despite printing a whole pile of money<br>and another bolt-on to try and beat<br>councils up for responding to the<br>incentives they face in blocking people<br>from building more<br>we need to rethink the whole system to<br>encourage councils to want to facilitate<br>growth<br>zero carbon act great that we're trying<br>to get towards net zero<br>it was banning oil and gas and taranaki<br>anywhere anything other than meatball<br>surgery<br>right it was just a terrible approach<br>the productivity commission had done<br>some work showing that that was the<br>single most productive sector that we'd<br>had right<br>it was published in new zealand economic<br>papers recently and they just turned it<br>off<br>because they had a headline on it when<br>going out to an international climate<br>conference<br>taking climate change seriously requires<br>better responses than that it means<br>taking the<br>emissions trading scheme seriously and<br>making sure it can be embedded but i'll<br>defer to matt burgess on that tomorrow<br>stay tuned for him he's awesome<br>um and then the productivity commission<br>sorry productivity in the frontier at<br>the border this is the most worrying in<br>the medium term<br>we have to be able to scale up at the<br>border we have to get some certainty<br>about what the heck happens once we are<br>all vaccinated or at least have access<br>to vaccines<br>and a sensible regime once everybody who<br>wants to be vaccinated can be vaccinated<br>you just say<br>anybody who wants to travel into new<br>zealand and who has been vaccinated<br>can come in you can't get outbreaks if<br>you've got mass vaccination right are<br>not goes well below one<br>one person might make it through if<br>they've been vaccinated but they're not<br>going to cause an outbreak<br>because you don't have a susceptible<br>population i worry<br>that the approach that we've gotten into<br>that john was talking about earlier is<br>going to be<br>ossified and that we are going to have<br>tremendous harm<br>not just in the international education<br>sector and in the universities but more<br>okay yeah start writing down those<br>questions because there was so much in<br>there that we can definitely touch on<br>um so to continue the conversation<br>i'm going to pass over to paul to get<br>your insight<br>in<br>you and i all of us together enjoy<br>well-being<br>it's a great phrase for starting a<br>session on<br>national well-being now in a sense<br>well-being economics has been with us<br>from the<br>origins of the modern discipline in 1776<br>but in another sense the term well-being<br>economics<br>reflects a growing dissatisfaction<br>including<br>within the profession with the<br>traditional approach<br>that economists make our best<br>contribution<br>to wellbeing when we are designing<br>policies<br>that encourage economic growth<br>and it's not hard to see where some of<br>that dissatisfaction is coming from<br>the statistical data around<br>global climate change statistical data<br>about the damage that economic activity<br>is doing to our own<br>natural environment the large numbers<br>of young people children growing up in<br>households with<br>inadequate economic resources for their<br>personal development<br>our generation my generation is leaving<br>a poor legacy for the next generation<br>so well-being economics starts with that<br>lived experience of people<br>and to quote and marchers sen it asks<br>the question<br>what can policy do to<br>expand the capabilities<br>of persons to lead the kinds of lives<br>they value and have reason to value<br>the answer to sen's question involves<br>some fundamental principles<br>policy design must recognize<br>the fundamental agency of<br>persons whanau communities<br>for creating well-being it is not a<br>question of the productivity commission<br>delivering well-being to people<br>secondly policy design must recognize<br>the power of market enterprise<br>to greatly expand capabilities of<br>people to create well-being<br>and thirdly governments<br>have a unique and distinctive<br>contribution to expanding capabilities<br>for wellbeing<br>taking collective choices that<br>individuals are unable to achieve<br>through their own private or market<br>activities<br>we've seen this during the no covert 19<br>crisis<br>the treasury's fiscal policy and the<br>reserve bank's monetary policy<br>have in my view undoubtedly saved lives<br>but there are consequences as we have<br>heard<br>net core crown debt has already doubled<br>from 60 billion in june 2019<br>to a forecast of 120 billion in june<br>this year<br>it will increase by another 60 billion<br>according to forecasts<br>over the next two years<br>accommodated by monetary policy this<br>fuels high<br>house prices the obligation to pay<br>interest on the new debt<br>reduces future fiscal options adding to<br>the burden that we are passing on to the<br>next generation<br>at the university of waikato it seems<br>safe to say that<br>altair or new zealand must forge its own<br>pathway through these challenges<br>bringing together the wisdom from<br>western science<br>and the wisdom from mataranga maori<br>from western science i have great<br>confidence in what economists call<br>endogenous growth theory for which paul<br>roma shared the nobel prize<br>in 2018 it<br>emphasizes how growth in the discovery<br>and the utilization of knowledge<br>is the only factor that can sustain<br>growth and living standards for<br>mataronga maori i have great confidence<br>in what we might call<br>indigenous growth theory which comes<br>from the whakapapa of tangata fenua<br>to it emphasizes concepts such as<br>kaitiakitanga<br>fanongatanga manakitanga and ohanga<br>fairawa<br>natororo nataku raoura<br>bringing these food baskets together the<br>people<br>thank you for and finally<br>in the corner there cameron over to you<br>all right it's at this moment i suddenly<br>realized i probably should have<br>scribbled out some notes<br>but what i thought i'd do first i'm<br>going to talk about monetary policy<br>fiscal policy and my take on well-being<br>and it'll be a little bit of speed<br>dating because i've got five minutes but<br>what i thought i'd do right up front<br>because there's a little bit of talk on<br>a couple of the presentations about<br>skills and where we're investing<br>and these sort of things there's also a<br>big area across the economy<br>we're missing and it's not getting out<br>sufficiently<br>in wider circles across the waikato<br>region<br>53.6 of students<br>regularly attend school<br>20 of students within the waikato region<br>attend school less than 80 of the time<br>now if i go back to 2015<br>70 of new zealand kids regularly<br>attended school<br>that number's now down to 57.7<br>45 of maori pacifica kids regularly<br>attend school<br>now i look at those numbers and i think<br>we've got a goddamn bomb that's about to<br>go off in 10 to 20 years<br>now we're already seeing the side<br>effects of this in regard to attainment<br>levels in regard to mass and the<br>sciences these sort of things<br>now these are some of the issues some of<br>the topics that you know i'd love to see<br>forums such as those<br>get up and shake the hell out of this<br>thing and folks<br>there's a whole lot of people here in<br>this audience you're involved in the<br>business community<br>well i've got news for you you're going<br>to receive an export<br>because that problem is going to get<br>exported into the business community if<br>we do not nip it right in the bud<br>very early on where we're seeing the<br>biggest decline in school attendance<br>is not the year 12 and 13 kids that are<br>monetary policy look hallelujah monetary<br>policy works<br>i during the reserve bank they went out<br>there and they did their job<br>probably a little bit too well uh<br>inflation<br>we're starting to see pressures we're<br>sort of in the zone of full employment<br>what we do know now about monetary<br>policy is that we're in danger of<br>testing the reserve being social license<br>people out there i don't think do not<br>understand negative interest rates and<br>it's fair enough because i think a whole<br>lot of economists don't understand the<br>concept either<br>but we are seeing is that you know<br>monetary policies have the side effects<br>of driving a bigger gap between the<br>haves and the have nots and the housing<br>affordability crisis is getting worse<br>and what that has done is it's forced<br>the government of the day to act yeah<br>what have they done<br>now they've redesigned the reserve<br>bank's remit now the reserve bank is<br>playing down the impact of that<br>the word assists implies you don't have<br>to do too much<br>well that remit has now also got<br>government policy involved in it<br>now i wonder whether that's the the<br>first cab off the rank in regard to<br>where we're going to see more changes<br>that's what happens<br>when you get a bit of a disequilibrium<br>regard to pushing against the<br>the so-called social conscience fiscal<br>policy once again<br>hat tip it's worked pretty well yes<br>we've got the problems you know<br>could have been executed an awful lot<br>better but with due hindsight they<br>needed to go<br>big and it's worked the big concern i<br>have about fiscal policy at the moment<br>is not the sort of next two to three<br>years it's the years 2025 to 2025 when<br>the rubber hits the road and we're going<br>to make those hard decisions<br>if you want an example what happens when<br>the rubber hits the road you need to<br>make some hard decisions have a look at<br>what's going on across local authorities<br>because they are now needing to make<br>those hard decisions the bun fights are<br>starting<br>and the central government arena we've<br>probably got a few more years before<br>those hard decisions need to take place<br>uh the projections show we can get<br>government debt down<br>if we crunch capital expenditure and run<br>healthlessly tight operational<br>expenditure do i think that's realistic<br>the answer is no you know i think we're<br>going to need the what's been put on the<br>table by the government and i like it<br>the independent fiscal institution i<br>think we're set for bigger government<br>and that needs appropriate checks and<br>balances<br>on the other side we've learned to use<br>fiscal policy<br>as more an economic stabilizer but we<br>need those checks and balances finally<br>just on wellbeing<br>it's a it's a big complicated framework<br>my view of well-being or what's going on<br>around the globe is pretty simple<br>he has a simple target boy a lot to keep<br>things pretty simple<br>look short-termism is out<br>and long-term game is in yeah<br>shareholder-based capitalism has been<br>replaced by takeover-based capitalism<br>you know the way i think about this is<br>that way back in 1999 i joined the<br>banking sector and a gentleman there so<br>john anderson taught us<br>look after your people because the<br>people look after the customer if the<br>customer looks after the shareholder is<br>going to get paid<br>but that was the order one two three<br>part of the reason the world<br>and new zealand's got out of whack is<br>that we reversed the order became three<br>two one<br>and what's going on at the moment with<br>the accord stakeholder capitalism<br>or the long game versus the short game<br>is to be going back to the previous<br>order which was<br>one two three kiss keep it simple sport<br>thanks<br>thank you<br>i suppose a good starting point is<br>actually just picking up<br>on and you all mentioned it 20 years<br>time<br>i'm a strategist i'm not an economist<br>and for me<br>a thought that i'd like to pose to all<br>three of you to maybe<br>discuss a bit further is in 20 years<br>time<br>some of the audience members here who<br>are students of the university of wakaso<br>or coming in as students<br>are possibly going to be put in your<br>positions<br>to reflect on what has gone and what we<br>should be doing<br>so if you we're thinking 20 years out<br>what do we need to do<br>now to make sure that this next<br>generation has both schooling and<br>education<br>has the policies in place by the<br>government to ensure that we thrive<br>and also we have a market that actually<br>works for us<br>okay uh i'll jump in if nobody else is<br>going to start um<br>i think it has to start by actually<br>taking some of the well-being talk<br>seriously<br>it can't just be mush to get away from<br>standard cost benefit assessment<br>i think it's been used that way a lot we<br>need to have<br>if we take this stuff seriously we have<br>to be rigorous about it we can't just<br>use a lot of fancy well-being words and<br>use that to patina over policies that<br>fundamentally cannot deliver<br>what they're supposed to be delivering<br>if we're going to take well-being in<br>education seriously and start addressing<br>some of these truancy problems<br>there's a cargo cult way of dealing with<br>that and there's a real way of dealing<br>with that<br>if imagine if you're a business and<br>you're giving your product away for free<br>at the same time your competitor is a<br>babysitting service that parents have to<br>pay for<br>and you cannot get people to come in the<br>door<br>for free what the hell is wrong with<br>your product right<br>there's something fundamentally wrong<br>there now we need to be evaluating which<br>schools are<br>able to get hard to reach kids into the<br>classroom<br>keep them there and teach them things<br>it's an evaluation and outcomes<br>based framework you start looking to see<br>which schools are doing well and this<br>the usual system response is well these<br>are load sl communities what do you<br>expect we can't do very much with them<br>they're a hard to reach group when we<br>were doing our education work we saw<br>huge differences<br>in performance within the same decile of<br>school we were in the idi lab we were<br>adjusting for everything that you can<br>find in there<br>about the family background of every kid<br>and you could still see<br>big differences in performance among<br>schools now most of them are performing<br>fairly similarly but you could find ones<br>that are doing really well<br>ones that we're doing really poorly we<br>need to be taking that approach<br>and then letting the ones that aren't<br>doing so well either get taken over by<br>ones that are doing better<br>learn from ones that are doing better we<br>need to find ways of getting the good<br>practice that we're<br>starting to identify down through none<br>of that kind of things going on in the<br>ministry of<br>ed they start talking about these<br>community of schools things but they<br>aren't taking data seriously they're not<br>doing the kind of evaluation work that<br>we need to start addressing the problem<br>that you're talking about<br>similarly in housing we need to get the<br>systems in place to be able to deliver<br>more housing on a rolling basis<br>we don't wind up with monetary policy<br>blowing out house prices<br>that's a starter for me thank you<br>i'm paul and in 20 years time that young<br>person<br>now an adult is leading a life that they<br>value and have reason to value<br>they are able to express their<br>creativity in their work and in their<br>leisure<br>they are able to build family defined<br>very widely<br>they are living as respected people in a<br>vibrant community whose cultural<br>heritage is<br>prospering they are able to be<br>entrepreneurs<br>in the marketplace to create value for<br>customers<br>and all of this is underpinned by public<br>policy<br>that fosters that creativity<br>that wellbeing and in particular i think<br>the the question is what are we not<br>doing now that we could be doing in 20<br>years time<br>is recognized today we recognize that<br>most building and construction is done<br>in the private sector<br>but the government has a particular role<br>in infrastructure<br>and 20 years time we recognize that most<br>knowledge generation<br>and utilization is in the private sector<br>but the government has a particular role<br>in underpinning the creation<br>dissemination<br>and utilization of knowledge including<br>through the university system but<br>much more broadly than that and as a<br>consequence of that<br>people are expanding their capabilities<br>of well-being<br>because we as a species in this country<br>are developing our capabilities through<br>knowledge generation and utilization<br>there's a whole lot of things that need<br>to take place uh<br>you know i agree you gotta<br>data's gotta be the epicenter of<br>everything<br>yeah because you've got the data does<br>not mean you're gonna get everything<br>right<br>but you got a better chance of hitting<br>the right number on the dartboard<br>you know so it does need to be<br>evidence-based i still<br>think that short-termism is rife<br>across the government sector there's<br>insufficient<br>long-term planning and i'll give you an<br>example<br>when treasury and the government put out<br>their median term projections<br>they tend to be dictated by<br>some fuzzy working assumptions and<br>operational spending capital spent<br>now if you think about infrastructure<br>it's a long-term project we should have<br>a bit of an idea about what we're going<br>to be spending for the next 10 to 15<br>years<br>and the 2018 budget the fiscal strategy<br>report assumption for capital spend per<br>year<br>beyond the four-year budget process was<br>10 billion i'm sorry 9 billion per year<br>yeah so i think it was moving at 4.5 per<br>year yeah so<br>they were going to spend more than 90<br>billion over a decade by the 2019 budget<br>that had crunched back to about 66<br>billion<br>the 2020 budget and the two and the<br>december economic and fiscal update they<br>crunched that back down to 30 billion<br>now that just tells me there is no<br>long-term strategy in regard to what<br>we're doing with the infrastructure<br>investment in new zealand within a<br>medium-term context<br>yeah we've got the next four years<br>pinned down but we do not have a<br>medium-term framework to start to think<br>about<br>where those needs are it's not rocket<br>science we know what the depreciation is<br>you have reasonable assumption about<br>what we're going to see in regard to<br>growth we've got all those sort of<br>projections<br>we should go to come up with some<br>credible numbers that you know<br>have a degree of stickability and this<br>is one of the reasons i'm really behind<br>the whole idea of having an<br>independent fiscal institution fiscal<br>policy is going to play a far bigger<br>role in our lives in the next decade and<br>they're going to need the checks and<br>balances<br>on it excellent now we've actually<br>started a barrage of um<br>of questions coming in so i'm going to<br>go directly back to there um one for you<br>eric and i want to start from the top<br>is um the reserve bank has been part of<br>the government's covert response<br>is it possible for it to maintain its<br>political independence<br>i think that depends on the governor and<br>right now we've got one who's a little<br>talks differently from prior governors<br>and seems to<br>very much share all of the policy<br>preferences<br>of the current government in partisan<br>terms<br>that itself is a risk to reserve bank<br>independence<br>neither of the others like to comment on<br>that i think certainly within the<br>monetary policy committee there is a<br>huge<br>fear of allowing inflationary<br>expectations<br>to rise again we are old enough to<br>remember the costs of monetary<br>disinflation<br>in the 1980s i don't think there's any<br>appetite for<br>taking any risks in that space so i<br>the independence of the reserve bank the<br>whole framework<br>is intact yeah it can't challenge that<br>what we are starting to see because<br>the social side of the ledger is getting<br>tested<br>we're starting to see that sort of<br>picking off around the edges now at the<br>moment<br>it's around the edges the risk is that<br>this stuff escalates uh interestingly<br>not sure if anybody's read the last<br>monetary policy<br>statement uh it's probably only people<br>like me that sort of<br>read through this sort of stuff because<br>i have to there was a box within the<br>last<br>monetary policy statement from the<br>reserve bank that looked at the maori<br>economy<br>and the structural issues between maori<br>employment<br>versus the likes of myself and<br>yeah i looked at that and i thought<br>that's a bit of an implicit jab from the<br>reserve bank<br>at getting fiscal policy settings right<br>and i liked it<br>i find some of that stuff kind of risky<br>right because when the<br>reserve bank starts poking the<br>government on things that are outside of<br>the bank's wheelhouse it makes it easier<br>for the<br>government to come back and mandate<br>things that<br>should have been reserved bank's job<br>right i guess the but i agree with you<br>on social license especially around<br>housing the<br>the pressures there are going to become<br>intolerable and robertson really needs<br>to make sure<br>that they are able to get housing fixed<br>because of some of this<br>yeah but if i have a look at yeah fixing<br>some of the structural issues within the<br>labor market in new zealand<br>i.e getting the maori pacific<br>unemployment rate<br>actually down doesn't just benefit<br>wellbeing and all those sort of fancy<br>terms out there<br>it has real economic benefits in regard<br>to where your equine level of interest<br>rates is going to be going forward<br>you know you reduce the the structural<br>unemployment rate comes down<br>yeah so it's implicitly related to what<br>the reserve bank has gotten of course<br>you know<br>yeah full employment's now within their<br>mandate so i think they've got every<br>right to get out there and start looking<br>at those things and good on them<br>okay um another one then i'm going to<br>pass over to<br>the audience so one for all of you<br>have we got the overall economic policy<br>mix right<br>or are we too focused on monetary policy<br>to do all the heavy lifting<br>well monetary policy is not doing all<br>the the heavy lifting<br>grant robertson the government deployed<br>a 63 billion dollar package of what they<br>still got 10 billion dollars up this<br>leave<br>yeah so the government's been there you<br>know they're joined at the hip<br>we can probably argue about whether the<br>mixes right down my personal view is<br>that fiscal policy should be doing more<br>and monetary policy less i worry more<br>about getting some of the structures<br>right<br>especially around the border in the<br>short term there are massive<br>opportunities for<br>improving safety within miq you look at<br>opportunities for adopting daily saliva<br>testing under the pcr regime<br>that raco science has rolled out<br>massively reduced risk if you massively<br>reduce risk some facilities start<br>you can start using some facilities that<br>you might not have had to look in at<br>previously<br>other things like universities starting<br>to run their own quarantine systems for<br>people who have been vaccinated<br>you can start thinking about this stuff<br>right but every time it's a stonewall<br>from<br>the dg health on this stuff i almost<br>feels like he knows that two layers down<br>from him<br>there's just utter incompetence within<br>the ministry of health and that<br>letting anything move in that system<br>risks the whole thing tumbling over<br>so i worry more about some of those<br>systemic structural issues i worry more<br>about<br>regime uncertainty that's coming in from<br>what the climate change commission is up<br>to<br>we've got a beautiful emissions trading<br>scheme they made vast improvements to it<br>last year<br>they've recognized none of that in the<br>approach that they're taking and they<br>are inducing<br>massive uncertainty about like for power<br>like for power generation<br>that we've had a very clean system for<br>that before they're mucking up all of<br>the incentives in that where you're not<br>sure whether the government's going to<br>come in<br>and step over the top in investment<br>decisions it's hard<br>to plan around a system that is just<br>bolting a pilot<br>pile of things that sound good on top of<br>an ets that already covers those areas<br>and would work well<br>i agree fiscal and monetary policy has<br>worked together to maintain aggregate<br>demand growth but the real challenges<br>are on the supply side<br>so how do we improve education human<br>capital acquisition<br>to grapple with implications of the new<br>knowledge economy<br>how do we incentivize the<br>spread of knowledge throughout the<br>economy<br>from using the assets that we have in<br>tertiary education<br>and crown research institutes and the<br>like those sorts of questions are going<br>to make a far<br>bigger difference to our 20 years in the<br>future citizen<br>on that yeah that your point in regard<br>to suppliers<br>is bang on the mark yeah covert is just<br>the ultimate disrupter and when you get<br>disruptors you get points of<br>vulnerability<br>become big issues and what has been one<br>of new zealand's big points of<br>vulnerability for a long time<br>that we sort of let slip and slip and<br>slip we've under invested in key<br>key people capability and now it's<br>coming back to bite us<br>and another flow on from some of that it<br>has<br>felt like there's been a very strong<br>xenophobic shift in new zealand<br>especially<br>since covent that foreigners were kind<br>of tolerated here before<br>if you look at the surveys kiwis are<br>very welcoming to migrate migration<br>the policy rhetoric coming into the 2017<br>election was very poor<br>it's gotten worse and i all of the talk<br>about immigration reset is scaring the<br>heck out of me<br>they are under the assumption that<br>migrants are<br>taking people's jobs it's back to the<br>lump of labor stuff<br>um it's not if we take some of what<br>paul's saying about endogenous<br>growth theory knowledge is often<br>embedded in people right and they bring<br>it with them and then they form new<br>networks here and link those networks<br>back to the networks that they had back<br>home and that improves the productivity<br>across the whole<br>shebang right but if you start viewing<br>migrants as a cost who are going to be<br>taking your house away from you because<br>we have broken housing settings that<br>won't let people build<br>and you've got a productivity commission<br>that ignores the evidence on migration<br>and says oh well it hurts locals<br>well-being or something so we're going<br>to<br>ban people from coming in it's turning<br>we're getting back towards a fortress<br>new zealand view of the country<br>but like with actual walls right and<br>that's<br>really going to be bad what i really<br>love is the passion<br>that these three bring to this and it<br>leads really nicely onto one more<br>question i'm going to take from<br>our viewers which is actually what<br>practical steps could the government<br>take to improve<br>how it makes policy to involve<br>the voices and the data that we're<br>actually seeing and hearing here<br>i know it does take on board what some<br>of our economists say<br>but it's actually a bigger and a wider<br>problem as you have alluded to eric with<br>we're bolting on lots of different<br>things to try and solve something<br>but how do we get a collective voice to<br>help develop<br>these policies i think fundamentally<br>there has to be demand for it among<br>voters<br>so if we look back under the last<br>government you started seeing<br>rigor coming in the budget bids from<br>different ministries when they knew<br>that if they submitted a bad budget bid<br>up into the<br>finance minister's office and then<br>cabinet was batting around who was going<br>to get what money<br>it was ones that had a rigorous cost<br>benefit assessment attached to them that<br>could demonstrate that they were going<br>to be delivering<br>that which was promised that built the<br>demand for rigorous approaches<br>for in the ministries right so they<br>started staffing up you started seeing<br>like mb hiring a chief economist you<br>started seeing these things happening<br>one of the first things that we heard<br>after the well-being budget was<br>analysts in ministries telling us well<br>they didn't really worry so much anymore<br>about treasury's evaluation of their<br>bids<br>because they knew that it didn't matter<br>anymore<br>one of the conversations we've been<br>having is about the<br>human capital in new zealand's public<br>service<br>and in particular the need to engage<br>people with<br>qualifications and expertise and<br>strengths<br>to be able to evaluate knowledge and to<br>apply it in a way that is effective<br>so there is a balance between public<br>participation<br>and export expert knowledge<br>that at the moment i think some of our<br>capabilities in our departments<br>in wellington have fallen in recent<br>years and that there is an opportunity<br>for<br>every every person in that role is<br>batting for the five million the team of<br>five million so the impact<br>of high human capital in the public<br>sector<br>amplifies when it's able to produce good<br>effective public policy<br>and we've lost sight of that because<br>we've been trying to cut costs rather<br>than investing in value<br>i'll put a i'm going to put a bit of a<br>different lens on some of the stuff<br>and yeah probably a little bit provoking<br>if you have a look at<br>one plus one now equals eleven that no<br>longer equals two<br>you we live in a world where disruption<br>the pace of change is accelerated and<br>it's not just yeah<br>technology driven disruption that you're<br>dealing with different people changes in<br>government policy<br>mother nature your hail storms down in<br>machu aka during the<br>during the summer yeah these sort of<br>things now we tell the private sector<br>you need to have a fundamentally<br>different mindset<br>to deal with widespread disruption where<br>do we not talk enough about<br>is that the role of government because<br>government needs to get into that same<br>non-linear mindset if you look at the<br>gut the balance sheet<br>of local authorities 150 billion the<br>balance sheet of the new zealand<br>government is 400 billion<br>now the problem one of the big problems<br>at the moment is that they are not<br>incentivized to take any risk<br>and not taking risk at the moment is<br>actually one hell of a risky strategy<br>and the discipline here is that you know<br>if something's bad policy and you trial<br>something<br>you've got to kill it straight away get<br>rid of it and this is one of the<br>problems and kiwi builds a classic<br>example it's a dog with fleece<br>why don't we just put it out of its<br>misery and redirect the money somewhere<br>else<br>five years ago we put up a report that<br>nashville ended up ignoring uh we were<br>arguing for this kind of an experimental<br>approach right where<br>it's tough to do it you've got a unitary<br>state local local governments<br>central government doesn't really trust<br>them right you look at the us they get<br>50 different experiments going on all<br>the time and you start learning what<br>what works what doesn't work they feed<br>off each other you really saw it during<br>bill clinton's welfare reforms we've got<br>no ability to do that here<br>we're recommending sort of bespoke<br>devolution following the manchester<br>model right<br>so local councils have something they<br>want to achieve get some devolved<br>responsibility from central government<br>under contract with the funding line and<br>with accountability metrics around it<br>and then let it roll out to other<br>regions if it proves up in the one area<br>so it gives some regional flexibility<br>right to respect that local<br>locations different from each other but<br>also gives you an opportunity to<br>experiment<br>and like nobody's picked this up but<br>we're imagining things like well if<br>migration policy looks pretty tight and<br>if at the time<br>dunedin was looking to want a lot more<br>migrants let them have more migrants<br>try out a different version of the rma<br>that's suitable for urban purposes in<br>auckland try different ways<br>of running the overseas investment act<br>for for wellington<br>see what winds up working and yeah<br>experimental approaches we really need<br>more of it<br>which is what business is about business<br>is actually focusing especially small<br>business<br>90 plus percent of what's happening in<br>new zealand is about how we innovate<br>and how we have our entrepreneurial<br>mindset to do things differently<br>yet we're not actually focusing that<br>from the top down and with our<br>government entities<br>there was a wonderful piece that was put<br>up by a friend from the uk<br>about um differences in mindset in the<br>public sector so he's contrasting<br>britain's response to covid with<br>britain's response to the second world<br>war<br>so the second world war battle of<br>britain just go to procurement real fast<br>get new fighter planes out you get the<br>job done<br>in covid when they were looking at<br>potentially having restrictions at the<br>border<br>like oh well running hotels might be a<br>little bit hard i guess we're not going<br>to do that<br>just finding the first obstacle as a<br>reason to not try doing something that<br>is the status quo in wellington right<br>now<br>you have to push them to think past the<br>first obstacle and the obvious solutions<br>to the first obstacle if they're always<br>looking for reasons to not do anything<br>i think our audience has anyone got a<br>question because we've really got some<br>some heated discussion here and some<br>real passion behind<br>our three panelists<br>i need to take my glasses off if that's<br>the case<br>at the back uh yeah so uh john gibson<br>abusing my position since i spoke<br>earlier um<br>cameron i don't know so well but paul<br>and eric uh<br>paul is an educator eric was an educator<br>the question i have for those two and<br>what in your opinion is the reason why<br>the skills which we've equipped well i<br>should<br>the skills which we hope we have<br>equipped graduates with and i'm thinking<br>particularly of economics graduates<br>honors graduates and so forth you know<br>as you know i teach some econometrics<br>statistical analysis and so forth<br>to go to the public sector to use those<br>skills but something happens and then<br>there's not the<br>opportunity to use the skills or the<br>skills uh are not being seen to be used<br>what is it within the public sector in<br>your opinions<br>that prevents the creative use of this<br>human capital that we've contributed<br>to um being used to to improve<br>public well-being by essentially a<br>rational and rigorous<br>uh application of of the human capital<br>you know it's pretty tough to teach<br>econometrics and gals markov and i<br>sometimes wonder what's the point<br>because actually there was no evidence<br>that any of those skills were being used<br>in the last 12 months<br>i think you've captured it really well i<br>think there are there are<br>countervailing trends so<br>the previous government has created the<br>position of<br>chief scientists in the government<br>departments and there is<br>a push for more skills and managing<br>knowledge in a way that feeds into<br>public policy<br>but on the other hand there is a move<br>to clear messaging of policy<br>and which the subtleties of<br>sophisticated analysis do not contribute<br>to those clear messages and and there<br>has been<br>i think of some departments in<br>particular<br>uh a move towards simple models rather<br>than to<br>best models and and so i share your<br>frustration<br>i think that this is my own personal<br>strategy<br>that if you ask an economist what<br>is it that contributes to sustained<br>productivity growth<br>i will say oh you are talking about<br>endogenous growth<br>theory for which the nobel prize was<br>shared<br>three years ago and the only thing<br>that can contribute to sustained<br>expansion<br>of living standards is the production<br>and utilization of knowledge and in<br>order to<br>produce and utilize knowledge you need<br>high human capital and so<br>if that is accepted and i think anybody<br>who's an economist<br>tell me that i'm wrong because i don't<br>think i am<br>then any government that signs up to<br>downplaying knowledge within their<br>government department is consigning new<br>zealand<br>to low productivity growth low<br>well-being<br>and once that's accepted i think the<br>rest will follow<br>yeah there might be a bit of problem in<br>getting that accepted though or even<br>noticed<br>um a phrase that i had never heard<br>when i lived in christchurch at the<br>university of canterbury uh that i<br>started hearing<br>increasingly after i moved to wellington<br>was the policy authorizing environment<br>that might not be something that's heard<br>in academia it gets<br>repeatedly pointed to by those who try<br>to take rigorous approaches<br>to policy within their ministries see<br>that taking that approach would require<br>that their manager<br>takes it up to the secretary that the<br>secretary takes it up to the minister<br>and that the minister then has to pick a<br>fight with another minister because it's<br>contrary to less rigorous policy that's<br>coming out of<br>another area when that happens it's<br>about<br>it's whether that fight is worth it for<br>that minister<br>and if you are in a bad policy<br>authorizing environment<br>it makes no difference whether you know<br>a wit of economics<br>now you can get everything set and ready<br>for when there is a better policy<br>authorizing environment so that when you<br>have a better minister or one that is<br>willing to pick that fight<br>or that fight becomes worth kicking you<br>are ready to go<br>with the answers so the what you could<br>be telling your students in that case<br>is when the policy authorizing<br>environment is poor<br>it is important to set the groundwork<br>for when that ground<br>shifts because it can shift in a hurry<br>there is actually there's actually been<br>some good stuff<br>that's gone on but we sort of let<br>ourselves down<br>in regard to execution i'll give you an<br>example the commerce commission got an<br>additional<br>30 million dollars in the 2000 and i<br>think it's a 2019<br>uh budget now they've got the potential<br>that gives them a fair bit of muscle in<br>regard to what they can do in regard to<br>looking at competitive pressures<br>across new zealand and what are we<br>getting just<br>just some real lightweight stuff from<br>regard to what's coming out sort of<br>it's not giving us anything back on the<br>other side but but i see across new<br>zealand at the moment there is a<br>distinct lack of competitive pressures<br>and some key sectors we all know who<br>they are<br>it's let's load it up and then you<br>wonder whether the answer is the<br>commerce commission<br>or whether the answer is changing things<br>of the overseas investment act<br>getting rid of some of the rules around<br>buying businesses that they can be taken<br>over<br>and get more competitiveness that way<br>make it easy as hell for ikea to show up<br>instead of telling them to go away for<br>rma reasons in<br>2007-ish making it easier for<br>unbanking kind of services to come in<br>the things that are happening in the<br>united states that aren't happening here<br>make it easier for those services to<br>provide it to be provided here because<br>we set a<br>low regulatory burden regulatory burdens<br>that everybody thinks are here to<br>protect new zealand consumers they are<br>protecting<br>us against better things that are<br>open banking needs to be accelerated<br>turbocharged<br>got another question coming from um carl<br>down there<br>cameron you got me a bit excited when<br>you started talking about an<br>entrepreneurial growth mindset and for<br>new zealand and i suppose it's similar<br>to the question i asked earlier about<br>diversifying new zealand's income<br>streams and accelerating it i'd like to<br>ask you the question<br>what would you do to accelerate and grow<br>the<br>entrepreneurial capability of new<br>zealand to a point where it could<br>actually be enough substantial billions<br>to actually help us go forward and be<br>the short answer is a whole lot<br>something that i'm really hot on at the<br>moment<br>is improving new zealanders financial<br>skills which i think is a sort of<br>sub-component<br>of this so if we go back to the global<br>financial crisis one of the big<br>learnings out of the global financial<br>crisis<br>was that we needed to make the banking<br>system safer<br>because it's a critical part of new<br>zealand infrastructure<br>and we did through various regulatory<br>mechanisms and that has been a real big<br>source of strength for new zealand<br>allowing the reserve bank<br>to do partly what they've done via the<br>banking sector helping us out<br>during the recent downturn what covert<br>has exposed apart from some obvious your<br>issues in regard to health readiness and<br>these are the things that we're going to<br>need to think about<br>down the track i think what covers<br>exposed there is a big portion of the<br>business sector across new zealand that<br>are just not<br>is what called financially fit and we're<br>seeing what's called the k-shaped cycle<br>some firms on the outward part of the k<br>and you've got these other firms on the<br>downward side of the cape and part of it<br>is just the basic<br>basic skill set if there is ever a time<br>in new zealand's history<br>where we could possibly get financial<br>literacy<br>or the better term because financial<br>literacy doesn't connect with kids<br>you got to call it something like money<br>mojo now's the time to get that embedded<br>within the curriculum<br>yeah i put a bit of a caution though<br>like it sounds great it sounds<br>intuitively obvious<br>when i looked at this i think about five<br>years ago the studies in the states are<br>showing that when you put it in the<br>school curriculum it does nothing<br>to later life outcomes if you provide<br>the training at the point where they're<br>starting to have to make financial<br>decisions like<br>if you've got some kind of training<br>module when they're having to think<br>about kiwisaver portfolios that might<br>start affecting things<br>but if you have it well in advance it it<br>kind of washes out and it's hard to see<br>the effect<br>it's also how you teach it like i'm on<br>the board of live feed new zealand<br>harold the giraffe and we just launched<br>into high schools and we've got a<br>financial literacy thing now we've<br>chosen<br>actors to teach the kids via theatre<br>sports why<br>because it's different it's unique what<br>are you doing to evaluate the<br>effectiveness over the long term<br>well that's a good question because we<br>are getting the feedback from the kids<br>and the teachers no but i mean like<br>following those kids five years later to<br>see whether<br>like surely you don't have capacity to<br>hit all the schools you'll be getting<br>more requests than you that you can<br>handle<br>you'll be triaging them somehow triage<br>them randomly<br>follow up with the kids who got the<br>treatment the ones who didn't five years<br>later see if the thing worked<br>you should be baking that into the<br>outside right i'm gonna go i'm gonna<br>come and have a chat to you and you're<br>out to some of your big corporate<br>sponsors and regardless<br>whether he has some assistance in regard<br>to that because i think that's an<br>outstanding idea that we'd love to be a<br>part of<br>at the moment we test the kids as they<br>go in versus what they<br>know as they come out so we're getting a<br>static sort of answer but i think that's<br>a great idea<br>it'd be neat to see what whether they<br>whether they switch out of a kiwisaver<br>default fund to a growth fund when they<br>get first on the job market right and<br>see if it makes any difference if it<br>does<br>you've done a massive amount of work if<br>you haven't then you learn something<br>right<br>yeah i like that but on the initial<br>question<br>somebody you should be reading is anton<br>house uh he's a<br>he's an economic historian who works for<br>the royal society and he's been doing<br>the history of innovation<br>he's got a big book out now on it where<br>he's looking at the track record of the<br>royal society over like<br>hundreds of years and what they were<br>doing to promote in<br>invention so he's there talking about<br>inventors and inventiveness that ties<br>pretty directly into innovation and<br>innovativeness and the inventive mindset<br>and he talks about the diffusion of an<br>inventive mindset when<br>people get exposed to other people who<br>see problems as something to be solved<br>and overcome for human betterment<br>rather than something just intractable<br>right you need exposure to people who<br>also think that way to help shape your<br>own thinking and he sees that in the<br>history of the diffusion of<br>inventiveness<br>now he'll also talk then about the<br>funnel of inventiveness where<br>you've got this potential supply of<br>people who've been exposed to an<br>inventive mindset<br>and then some of them get dissuaded<br>because you've got like stupid red tape<br>barriers or you've just made it too hard<br>or you've put in too many other veto<br>players somewhere else in the process<br>all of those also matter but getting the<br>top of the funnel right<br>that matters a lot too and i think we've<br>forgotten that we've treated innovation<br>and growth is this horrible bad thing<br>instead of being the fundamental way<br>that we<br>progress society and improve well-being<br>and following on from that thought the<br>living standards framework<br>is how the government is framing its<br>conversation and policy around<br>well-being<br>and treasury are quite open that we<br>received feedback saying that we needed<br>to address<br>entrepreneurial skills within the<br>framework<br>it's too hard we've left it to the<br>review in 2022<br>and as a consequence it's invisible to<br>people thinking about well-being in the<br>public policy space and yet as eric's<br>just said it's<br>fundamental that's what we mean the<br>creation and utilization<br>of new knowledge innovation<br>it really points me to a um i hope we've<br>got another question down the back but<br>i'll pour into this one first<br>um when children grow up they're curious<br>they're very curious they pull something<br>apart it's the first thing they<br>generally do they possibly put it in<br>their mouths as well<br>but then as they go through the<br>educational system they're<br>basically put into boxes and constrained<br>we have economists we have accountants<br>we have marketers we have strategists<br>and we have policy makers we have so<br>many things in the boxes but innovation<br>crosses and the ability to cross all of<br>those things<br>and and to bring them together to<br>continue that curious mindset<br>that to me is something that we can<br>start now<br>we can start in our educational i mean<br>schools are very good at creating<br>curious mindsets<br>but we can start with it at work and<br>business as well<br>we have been generally a nation where<br>it's not good to fail<br>we um our banking system doesn't like<br>investing in failures<br>it likes investing and getting a good<br>return so what could we do to ensure<br>that even though we've got limited<br>return on our investment at the moment<br>businesses start investing<br>and they recognize there could be<br>failures but they're curious to build<br>that productivity through that<br>1776 adam smith uh<br>the wealth of nations specialization and<br>trade<br>is the beginning of it and so i don't<br>want to turn everybody into generalists<br>i think there is a role in the education<br>system<br>i call it the four ds it's discover<br>what you are good at discipline what you<br>are good at<br>display what you are good at and<br>recognize the diversity<br>as people make these individual choices<br>so<br>yes we need to build solid platforms but<br>eventually people specialize and that's<br>how we build skills and by trading with<br>each other<br>we're you know from my food basket your<br>food basket the people will be well fed<br>uh<br>but in terms of the the the essence of<br>your question<br>i i have a a lot of respect for the the<br>capability theory of the firm<br>which is david thies a new zealand<br>economist working in the united states<br>that the dynamic capabilities created by<br>entrepreneurs in which they sense<br>what will add value to their customers<br>or consumers<br>and sense the technological developments<br>that allow them to achieve that<br>that's at the heart of it and<br>it comes back again to what do we know<br>what do we know about our consumers in<br>asia this is<br>eric's point about we need these<br>connections<br>through our borders we need asian people<br>among our community<br>as citizens contributing to<br>connections with our largest closest<br>markets<br>and and i think there are opportunities<br>in new zealand we are<br>we are an open friendly society<br>that has the ability to<br>recognize what creates value<br>and the skills to bring together<br>resources<br>to deliver and capture some of that<br>value<br>i challenge a little bit of the initial<br>framing that you've had i agree with<br>what you've been talking about<br>the initial framing felt a lot like<br>a lot of what i get in wellington like<br>you go to a whole pile of these<br>workshops and you get people<br>who are in policy to work and in<br>productivity work and they ring their<br>hands and they say<br>well how can we tell firms how to be<br>more productive<br>right or how how can we make them be<br>more like the more productive firms and<br>what can we do to force them to be that<br>way<br>right it's a it's kind of got the thing<br>backwards right<br>if you set the appropriate enabling<br>environment<br>firms that are innovative will rise to<br>the top they'll out-compete the others<br>they'll attract more customers they'll<br>get more trade<br>they'll be able to provide more value<br>they'll be able to outbid competitors<br>for more highly skilled people they they<br>will do well<br>you need to make sure that you have the<br>right enabling framework that you don't<br>have barriers to competition that you<br>don't make it too hard for them<br>to expand by setting up things where<br>like the great big guys can afford these<br>regulatory impositions and they're<br>basically bureaucracies anyway of their<br>own<br>and little guys can never get a startup<br>because we've just made it too hard<br>you set that framework right and then<br>the innovation can happen<br>if you instead set the framework<br>backwards and then see that innovation<br>isn't happening and then wring your<br>hands in a bloody boardroom in<br>wellington again about<br>how can we make firms be more productive<br>and that just gets it all wrong yeah<br>you use the word i think fail at the<br>start<br>we no longer talk about failure we put<br>everybody in a stage which would cause<br>deferred achievement<br>which is the the real polite version but<br>it's actually it<br>i think it's a big issue because what<br>we're doing is they're actually<br>it's almost like we're de-risking kids<br>too<br>far from the real world you know<br>you can't go and climb in a tree or in a<br>swing or these sort of things now<br>you're my personal you bit off to take a<br>few knocks when you're young no for a<br>young kid because it's going to teach<br>you a lesson or two and it's going to<br>make you more resilient when you take<br>those big knocks<br>when you're older and what i think we're<br>starting to see is a lot of people do<br>not have those resilience to take the<br>bigger knocks when they leave school<br>because we we're taking risk out of the<br>equation<br>yes now down the back i head over over<br>so the question is given the rising<br>complexity of policy<br>making how what are the implications for<br>the way we<br>train students of economics and the<br>short answer obviously is to learn to<br>analyze and cope with complexity<br>and risk i mean john gibson gave us a<br>good example of what that might involve<br>prior to afternoon tea<br>i i think the complexity<br>is increasing because we are<br>growing as a species and<br>the impact that is having on the<br>environment<br>is creating enormous feedback loop<br>challenges that we have to become more<br>sophisticated<br>or like the dinosaurs it'll be our turn<br>to<br>die out i mean this is just what it<br>means to live<br>in the natural environment but i i have<br>a lot of faith<br>in the creativity of the science<br>community<br>globally to address<br>challenges of complexity and<br>risk complexity<br>uh you know the the sorts of tools we<br>have<br>at our disposal in 2021<br>compared to 2019 yet alone 1919<br>is just stunning and and so this is what<br>it means<br>as a science community this is our<br>contribution<br>to well-being is grappling with that<br>sort of issue<br>i take it a couple of ways so economist<br>acting as economists shouldn't be making<br>value judgments they should be<br>emphasizing<br>trade-offs so that people can make their<br>own value judgments and see what the<br>costs are if i do this thing then<br>there's this cost over here do i view<br>that as being worthwhile or not<br>now that should be intermediated ideally<br>through treasury's cost-benefit<br>framework where they try to put numbers<br>on all of these things so that you<br>don't wind up getting different<br>weightings on different aspects of it in<br>different policy areas<br>so you can make the incommensurable<br>commensurable so<br>training in how cbac works and in<br>cost-benefit assessment<br>can be pretty helpful in that but i'd<br>also worry that we are often<br>making policy unnecessarily complicated<br>that we are trying to load too many<br>things into single policies<br>rather than having each one directed<br>towards a single problem<br>rather and i'll take concrete example<br>right<br>so the climate change commission's<br>report has this big section<br>on uh native trees versus uh exotics<br>right<br>as part of new zealand's climate<br>response and it worries about whether<br>working through the ets and carbon<br>pricing encourages too much planting of<br>exotics<br>the climate commission should never be<br>worried about that they should only be<br>worried about<br>meeting the net zero target and making<br>sure the ets is robust<br>if some other part of government thinks<br>that there are biodiversity benefits of<br>having natives as compared to exotics<br>they should be subsidizing the planting<br>of natives or taxing the planting of<br>exotics and i don't care which<br>but it should be outside of the climate<br>commission's wheelhouse right it's<br>making them adjudicate on somebody<br>else's set of trade-offs and it's not<br>their job and it means that they're<br>going to wind up doing a worse job<br>at the thing that they're supposed to be<br>i think one of the big challenges for<br>the economist fraternity<br>is kiss keep it simple sport<br>you know we've got a real big issue in<br>regard to how we communicate<br>what can be often you know complex<br>notions and ideas we've got to break it<br>down so it's accessible for the general<br>public<br>i really like what the reserve bank has<br>done under adrian in the past<br>you know a couple of years in regard to<br>the communication style<br>you're trying to make sure that monetary<br>policy is more accessible<br>more understandable to a wider portion<br>of the public as opposed to a narrow<br>group of financial<br>market analysts i would definitely agree<br>with that one<br>um i've got just a couple more questions<br>one from<br>our online audience what can we learn<br>from economic policy<br>offshore both good and bad<br>very little okay um look i think<br>i think and and john gibson i'll return<br>to john you know we we put up other<br>countries<br>and we put up new zealand's example and<br>we say we're doing very badly<br>and and and singapore we won't include<br>that because that's a special case but<br>but new zealand's a special case and<br>every economy is a special case i think<br>we need<br>an indigenous economic strategy within<br>the public service<br>not in the sense of detailing you do<br>this you do that you do the next thing<br>but accumulating and assessing<br>and opening up for discussion knowledge<br>about our own economic pathway<br>that draws on our assets<br>the four capitals but more than that<br>seven capitals including knowledge<br>capital cultural capital and diplomatic<br>capital<br>and then looking at how we can<br>coordinate<br>investment in human capital and skills<br>with investment and technologies with<br>investment and entrepreneurial effort<br>in a way that is appropriate for the<br>strengths and weaknesses<br>of a small distance economy on the edge<br>of the pacific<br>i think there are important things that<br>we have to learn from abroad<br>land use planning is utterly broken here<br>if you look at texas<br>if you want to be horribly depressed<br>tonight go to zillow.com<br>zillow.com is the american equivalent of<br>homes.cod.nz<br>it's like pornography for housing where<br>you can look at other people's houses<br>you can look at the prices take a look<br>and just take a look at the house that<br>you've got now on homes.com nz<br>turn it into a u.s price and look at<br>what you could buy for that value<br>outside of atlanta or lots of places<br>right<br>maybe not san francisco san francisco is<br>broken but we can learn things from the<br>places that have gotten housing right<br>now we have to adapt those to make them<br>work here but they don't have broken<br>incentive systems<br>right they make growth be in the<br>interest of the locality that gets to<br>decide on whether growth will be allowed<br>or not and we don't do that<br>right we've got those things broken we<br>can look at how tokyo manages it if you<br>don't like atlanta<br>you might like tokyo tokyo gets it right<br>too they enable a lot more housing there<br>we can learn from other places water if<br>we find<br>that the gravitational constant in nepal<br>is one number we don't have to recreate<br>it here the gravitational constant is a<br>gravitational constant water flows<br>downhill in one place is going to flow<br>downhill another place and it's weird to<br>new zealand's embarking on an economic<br>transformation that could potentially<br>make<br>the 1980s and the 1990s look like a walk<br>in the park<br>and we should not underestimate the<br>degree of structural change that is<br>going to go on across new zealand in the<br>next sort of 10 to 15 years<br>now fiscal policy is going to have to be<br>a lot more active and more wise during<br>those<br>previous periods in regard to acting as<br>a stabilizer<br>and with the various transitions they're<br>going to take to take place<br>across new zealand we're going to need<br>two things look one we're going to need<br>to<br>be looking abroad for what other<br>countries have done<br>who have gone through some of the<br>transitions that we are looking at but<br>secondly and this is<br>the thing that worries me about fiscal<br>policy at the moment your fiscal policy<br>broadly speaking is it's okay fit for<br>purpose in the short term<br>they're dealing with covet we might have<br>a few deployment issues but<br>it's broadly okay i do worry about the<br>clear lack of fiscal strategy<br>10 years out in regard to where we're<br>going<br>the analogy i use is that when you look<br>at other countries experiences<br>it's like putting up the scaffolding<br>they that gives you ideas<br>possibilities worth exploring but<br>ultimately the building that you make<br>has to stand<br>according to its own internal coherence<br>structure<br>and that's what i mean by an indigenous<br>strategy something that works because it<br>all<br>fits together in this place not because<br>we think it worked there or because it<br>worked there<br>but because we are confident it'll work<br>here as part of the larger integrated<br>framework that we are building up<br>through our trials and experimentation<br>across the country<br>i won't disagree with that but i do<br>think it's really important to show the<br>examples from overseas<br>like to give an example of okay we're a<br>business membership organization it's<br>the<br>ces of the main big end of town that are<br>members oliver had taken them out<br>on a study tour out to switzerland to<br>show them that local government doesn't<br>have to suck<br>right because everybody's experiences in<br>dealing with like maybe it's different<br>here<br>right right here in hamilton i'm sure<br>you guys have it all right but other<br>people<br>find that they have big problems when<br>they're trying to deal with their local<br>council<br>and then finding that it doesn't have to<br>be that way right you can see you tried<br>to live in switzerland far out the red<br>tape<br>by local cantons it's just extremely you<br>can choose across them right<br>and they adapt to things that work<br>better we're getting fabulous stories<br>out of there of<br>the canton's competing to get investment<br>get new factories there getting more<br>housing there<br>the rail lines that get put through just<br>fantastic things you're not going to try<br>and encourage local bodies to compete<br>with each other to attract external<br>investment using ratepayers<br>absolutely not no it's going to be about<br>just checking<br>hey um just one book we've gone really<br>well with time so one more question from<br>the audience and then we'll wrap up<br>i think over here for the microphone<br>thank you<br>i appreciate the opportunity i wasn't<br>originally going to ask a question<br>but i see that this is a very brave and<br>solution orientated uh panel<br>so um i'll leverage that opportunity<br>just a little bit off the back of that<br>question that i asked<br>to professor gibson and there was a<br>little bit of acknowledgement around it<br>in terms of the disparity between the<br>statistics around maori unemployment and<br>um<br>and and pakis or mainstream unemployment<br>what what what are some of the what are<br>some of the<br>uh solutions that was the question i<br>posed to professor gibson<br>to to try and close that gap and i'm<br>i'm conscious and i acknowledge that<br>you've kind of you've touched on a few<br>and you've danced around the edges of a<br>couple of others<br>but i suppose i'd be quite interested<br>from uh<br>particularly from professor dazelle's<br>perspective given that you<br>you seem to be a little bit more well a<br>little bit more understanding in terms<br>of<br>mataranga maori so perhaps a good place<br>to start and then<br>the rest of the panel okay<br>look i don't know much but the work i'm<br>involved with at lincoln university<br>involves a lot of case studies with<br>maori<br>land-based enterprises<br>trying to bring together western science<br>with maori tradition<br>the kaiti kaitiakitanga responsibilities<br>supervised by the aunties on the paipai<br>who are saying<br>this is not right we're not going to do<br>that at the same time as saying how do<br>you construct a global<br>agri-food value chain from<br>the produce of our land into markets<br>into<br>beijing tokyo california wherever<br>and there is some stunningly innovative<br>stuff<br>being done within maori enterprise<br>to create value<br>for the ewe and<br>that has been fed through into<br>scholarships for<br>young people to advance their human<br>capital<br>in a way that does not cut the ties from<br>the cultural heritage without which<br>there is no life<br>so my my first response<br>is that the treaty settlements<br>have created an economic base<br>that maori are translating<br>into a platform for dynamic<br>entrepreneurial behavior that is opening<br>up<br>amazing vistas for maori<br>globally and and so for example we did a<br>study of consumers of<br>lamb and the uk before and after covert<br>and in both of them new zealand lamb<br>welsh lamb are both<br>thought of very highly and we asked a<br>question about<br>lamb source from maori farms<br>and there is a segment about 60 percent<br>of a thousand respondents<br>who were revealing through their choices<br>that they would pay<br>a premium for lamb from<br>maori farms and we're exploring further<br>but it's<br>exactly about trusting kaitiakitanga<br>and what that means for safe food and<br>stewardship of the environment so that<br>that coming together<br>of the two cultures within this country<br>i think is one of the strengths<br>the tonga that we heard about earlier<br>this morning<br>that will drive prosperity for those<br>young people that are going to be 20<br>years older<br>in 2041. i<br>can't disagree with any of that i'd add<br>a little bit<br>when we were looking through that idi<br>data on school performance you can see<br>big differences in which schools are<br>able to<br>do a lot more to help kids who are from<br>disadvantaged backgrounds and that is<br>unfortunately often from maori<br>backgrounds<br>and it is too often that<br>poor performance is written off as being<br>something inevitable i think that we set<br>too low of expectations of the schools<br>in some of these areas that we need<br>obviously there has to be the support<br>there but we can see which ones are<br>already<br>doing a better job and which ones are<br>doing a worse job and making sure<br>that we find out what what successful<br>schools are doing a little bit better<br>than ones that aren't doing quite as<br>good a job there we need to have better<br>expectations there<br>i also wonder about um i had talked<br>before<br>about sort of federalist approaches and<br>special economic zones and trying to get<br>different policies by region i also<br>really love the idea of devolution down<br>to ewe<br>rather than to regional councils or to<br>local councils like<br>imagine if instead of having to go to<br>council to get your building consent<br>i i still think in canterbury terms<br>going to natahu and saying well actually<br>can i go to you as my consenting<br>authority<br>and put my land under maori title<br>instead of<br>regular title and you be the consenting<br>authority instead of the damn council it<br>won't let me do anything<br>i'll paste on my rights to you instead<br>imagine what starts happening<br>in that kind of world right you get<br>competitive governance and people being<br>able to select into ones that work a<br>little better<br>i think there are some neat<br>opportunities in in playing with that<br>now i'll be data-driven decision-making<br>now we've got the information there and<br>use it to drive<br>investment decisions which do not<br>necessarily have to be military-based<br>they can be social based<br>but they have a monetary value down the<br>track as well<br>uh be prepared if the policy is not<br>working you<br>you kill it re-drink your funds into<br>something else it's going to work we've<br>got to get i think we've got to be a<br>little bit more<br>ruthless about what we're prepared to do<br>so we started doing that under the<br>investment approach and then they<br>kind of kind of ended well hopefully the<br>next speaker might talk a little bit<br>about that<br>this university has an excellent program<br>around<br>maori achievement in schools is it<br>kotahitanga the name of<br>just amazing insights from talking to<br>the teachers to the students to the<br>parents to the whanau<br>and uh and translating that knowledge<br>into action across the whole education<br>system i think will amplify<br>what you're asking so i'm really<br>conscious of time because we've been<br>going for<br>an hour 15 which really tells us how<br>wonderful these three<br>gentlemen are as speakers so i would<br>pose one question for you to sum up<br>in some of your viewpoints in a couple<br>of sentences<br>and going back to have we got the right<br>mix<br>and that is what would good look like<br>for you<br>tomorrow and what do we need to do today<br>a commitment from the public sector<br>to recognize and implement its<br>distinctive contributions<br>to the creation dissemination and<br>utilization of knowledge<br>if it were tomorrow what good would real<br>uh<br>they can do great dream thinking things<br>that are utterly implausible<br>grant robertson saying that budget bids<br>will be selected on the basis of cost<br>effectiveness and they better be<br>rigorous in bringing their budget bids<br>for the next round<br>it's probably going to be it's way too<br>late for that for the coming budget but<br>for the next one that would have to be<br>in place<br>and that the ministry of health will not<br>be the sole gatekeepers of decisions<br>about the border anymore that there has<br>to be a more<br>a broader framework that treasury has to<br>be back in the mix in helping in<br>decisions<br>that risk proportionality has to be<br>considered and that we have to be able<br>to strengthen<br>take up some of the opportunities that<br>have been presented to the ministry for<br>improving safety so that we can start<br>rebuilding international connections<br>excellent and finally uh<br>the macro stuff across new zealand is<br>actually pretty good in all honesty<br>the challenge we've got going forward is<br>it's the fine-tuning of all the little<br>stuff and if we don't get that<br>fine-tuning of all the little stuff<br>right then eventually we end up with big<br>problems<br>and housing is a classic example today<br>and<br>we didn't get there overnight you know<br>so<br>yeah we've got to get all the micro<br>economic things right<br>going forward macro was a decades ago<br>story now it's about those small<br>micro things and it's about getting a<br>whole lot of little things done well<br>that will add up at the end<br>so i think that's a really good point to<br>finish on and um<br>i think all of the audience here as well<br>as myself<br>would like to thank the three of you for<br>your wisdom your debate<br>your agreement you're stretching the<br>topic further afield than what we<br>started with to really give us something<br>to think about<br>i know a number of you are going to be<br>staying along so please continue the<br>conversation<br>over dinner for those staying for dinner</p></main><footer
