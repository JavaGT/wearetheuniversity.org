So that's basically what the piece is.<br>So every year I walk down into CubaDupa.<br>I love that festival, it's very rich and very vibrant <br>you can go to the nooks and crannies you know everywhere that it is<br>But one of the things I felt a few years ago was that you don't really ever, um<br>You don't really ever experience the whole site. You know you're always in one tiny part of it. <br>And so I thought wouldn't it be amazing <br>to create some kind of event that made  <br>a large part of the audience at a certain <br>moment aware of a huge part of the footprint of CubaDupa.<br>CubaSonic the idea emerged in 2018 <br>and the whole piece was created during that year  <br>with the plan to perform it 2019 but as <br>you know in 2019 we had terrible mosque shootings in Christchurch <br>and that meant that at the last minute CubaDupa had to scramble  <br>and do everything indoors and so we couldn't <br>do this piece<br>so it was postponed to 2020 we all know what happened in 2020.<br>So here we are in 2021 and everything's looking good.<br>We had a massive rehearsal a few weeks ago <br>with one third of the musicians and it sounds amazing.<br>So basically, it will have been a <br>three to four year project coming to fruition.<br>People have been asking me: where's the best place <br>to stand? and there is no best place to stand  <br>because it's designed in such a way that <br>firstly it'll be unique wherever you are  <br>and secondly because we have two <br>performances ideally you'd go to it  <br>twice and be in two completely different <br>places because you will have a different experience.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
