Courts in New Zealand, England and Wales have developed new privacy torts protecting against the unwanted exposure of private information and activities.  These changes have transformed the legal landscape in which the media, government and private individuals operate.  They have also significantly influenced society’s understanding of privacy and its importance.<br><br>In this lecture, Professor Nicole Moreham examines what the development of the tort of privacy tells us about the common law and the way it shapes and responds to changing societal values. Reflecting on her own experience growing up with the privacy torts, she considers the role of the legal scholar in common law development and shows how conversations between the common law and the society it serves enrich both parties to it.  <br><br>This is Professor Moreham’s inaugural lecture as Professor of Law at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

victoria<br>university of wellington<br>we are as you know new zealand's<br>globally ranked capital city university<br>and new zealand's top-ranked university<br>for the intensity of research and it's<br>my<br>very great pleasure to host you all this<br>evening<br>i'd like to briefly introduce professor<br>morum<br>before i hand over to her to deliver her<br>lecture<br>professor morum completed her bachelor<br>of laws with honours at the university<br>of canterbury<br>and was admitted to the bar in 1997.<br>she then went on to complete her<br>master's and phd<br>at gonville and keys college at the<br>university of cambridge<br>in the uk after beginning her academic<br>career at cambridge as a fellow<br>and lecturer in law at keys she joined<br>us very luckily for us<br>at the faculty of law as a lecturer in<br>2006.<br>in 2011 nicole became the first<br>legal scholar ever to be awarded a<br>rutherford discovery fellowship<br>this prestigious fellowship funded a<br>range of privacy-focused research work<br>including her monograph the principles<br>of privacy<br>which he hopes will be published in and<br>i've got two options here nicole<br>2022 or soon the elusive monograph<br>she was promoted to associate professor<br>in 2013<br>and then to professor on the 1st of<br>january<br>2019<br>professor morum teaches and researches<br>on media law<br>in the law of obligations with a<br>particular<br>focus on the law of privacy she's the<br>principal<br>editor and contributor to the leading<br>english<br>privacy work the law of privacy

chapters for journals<br>worldwide on the protection of privacy<br>including in the law quarterly review<br>the cambridge law journal<br>and the modern law review her work has<br>been extensively<br>cited by other scholars and by courts<br>throughout the commonwealth<br>including the uk supreme court the<br>english court of appeal<br>the new zealand supreme court and the<br>new zealand court of appeal<br>which just a couple of weeks ago was<br>citing her work<br>extensively in the case of heinman and<br>walker<br>her advice and ideas have been relied<br>upon by law reform agencies in new<br>zealand and australia<br>including in the australian law reform<br>commission's 2014 record<br>recommendations on the form of a new<br>statutory tort<br>of privacy in australia<br>nicole is regularly invited to speak at<br>international and local conferences<br>indeed i know this because i myself have<br>invited her to speak because i know she<br>always does a fabulous job<br>and she's also often asked by media for<br>comment on privacy related subjects<br>she gives frequent interviews often<br>talks to non-academic audiences on her<br>areas of expertise one of her recent<br>appearances included a lengthy<br>interview on media watch discussing<br>the duchesses of sussex letter to her<br>father<br>and the uk court ruling around<br>this now in her lecture tonight<br>professor morum will discuss the way in<br>which new privacy torts<br>have transformed the legal landscape<br>in which the media government and<br>private individuals<br>operate she will examine what the<br>development of the tort of privacy<br>tells us about the common law and the<br>way it<br>shapes in response to changing societal<br>values<br>reflecting on her own experience growing<br>up with privacy torts<br>she will consider the role of the legal<br>scholar<br>in common law development and show how<br>conversations<br>between the common law and the society<br>it serves<br>enriches both parties please join with<br>me<br>in welcoming professor nicole morum to<br>the podium<br>well thanks for that kind of<br>introduction wendy<br>i've been warned by a couple of friends<br>uh on claudia geiringer<br>amongst them that writing an inaugural<br>lecture is not as easy as it might look<br>and i have to say that that wasn't<br>particularly encouraging because it<br>didn't look even remotely easy<br>the brief as i understand it is that one<br>should kind of weave a narrative<br>of the arc of one's career so far<br>acknowledging those who've supported and<br>influencing you<br>influenced you and to do so in a way<br>which shows sufficient depth of<br>understanding to be of interest to the<br>chief justice whom i wanted to see here<br>but also accessible enough to be of<br>interest to your mum and dad to your<br>family and friends who've never attended<br>a law lecture before and hopefully to<br>hold the attention of my three kids<br>sitting here in the front so why would<br>anyone accept a brief like that<br>well the answer is because it's a great<br>privilege particularly in 2021<br>to be able to reflect on what you do and<br>why you do it<br>surrounded by the community that you<br>seek to serve and that supports you back<br>and by that i talk about dear colleagues<br>here at tahara waka<br>judges from the supreme court and court<br>of appeal in the local high court kiara<br>journalists member of the members of<br>government agencies of the wider legal<br>profession and of course the family and<br>friends i mentioned already<br>many of whom fit into one of those other<br>categories as well<br>so the secondary question along with the<br>content of this talk that i had in mind<br>when i was writing it<br>was what do i want to tell this lovely<br>group of people about what i do<br>and why i do it now the starting point<br>for that thinking was always going to be<br>my two<br>legal loves the common law and the law<br>of privacy more particularly the<br>protection against unwanted exposure in<br>all its forms<br>now the reason that i'm an academic<br>rather than a barrister as i'd always<br>intended<br>was that since the late 1990s these two<br>things have converged in a spectacular<br>form<br>and the protection of privacy has been<br>at the cutting edge of common law<br>development ever since<br>now the reason for that is in the course<br>of two decades we've gone from having<br>no or almost no privacy protection in<br>england and wales and in new zealand<br>to a situation where the tour is being<br>applied in england at least in dozens of<br>cases a year<br>now given that the mid-90s was also when<br>i first encountered the law<br>and the law of privacy in particular<br>it's no exaggeration to say that i've<br>grown up with these privacy torts<br>and today i want to talk about that<br>process the interweaving of my career in<br>law<br>with the development of privacy<br>protection in the courts<br>and in doing that i want to talk about<br>my understanding of how the common law<br>can both respond to<br>and shape societal change and about the<br>role of the academic in that process<br>now before i develop that further i<br>thought i should pause to give a brief<br>introduction or a brief summary for<br>those of you already know<br>of my understanding of what the common<br>so how does the common law work well<br>at its simplest the common law is judge<br>made law<br>the law of the courts it's not written<br>down in a statute<br>parliament didn't enshrine it rather<br>it's the law that's been built up over<br>centuries<br>by judges deciding which of the two<br>parties in front of them should win the<br>legal dispute in question<br>now each time there's a dispute of that<br>nature the judges give their reasons as<br>to why they reached the conclusion they<br>did<br>and it's those reasons or at least parts<br>of them<br>that make up the content of the common<br>law<br>and its binding and much is the same way<br>as a statute would be<br>so let's take a topical example to show<br>how this would work in practice<br>let's imagine that where's dean there he<br>is<br>use your name in vain let's imagine that<br>dean here sued me<br>because i published without his consent<br>a personal letter<br>which he had written to me now the judge<br>in the dean and nicole case decided<br>that dean should be successful in that<br>action and she gave detailed reasons for<br>her decision now the next time that<br>somebody came along<br>and published someone's letter without<br>their consent the judge could go back to<br>that dean and nicole decision<br>to see how it was decided so<br>if graham published a letter from<br>claudia in similar circumstances then<br>claudia would win<br>because the doctrine of precedent says<br>that the dean and nicole decision should<br>be followed<br>now it might be difficult to see how a<br>precedent-focused<br>system like this might ever change but<br>it does<br>because the reality is that nothing ever<br>happens quite the same way twice<br>so let's assume that a couple of months<br>after the dean and nicole decision<br>graham publishes a personal letter<br>written by claudia but this time he<br>wasn't the recipient of the letter<br>rather he picked it up off the street<br>when she dropped it as she was walking<br>along with him behind her<br>now the court has to decide how to apply<br>the principles of the dean and nicole<br>decision<br>in this slightly different situation<br>and this is the point at which things<br>get contestable<br>because one court might say well the<br>essential basis of the dean and nicole<br>decision was that they were in a<br>relationship with trust of confidence<br>and when i published that letter i was<br>breaching that relationship of<br>confidence<br>and because that relationship was<br>missing in this new graham and claudia<br>situation<br>then claudia's actually would be<br>unsuccessful that's a breach of<br>confidence<br>analysis but alternatively the court<br>might say<br>okay yeah it was an issue that nicole<br>was in a relationship of trust and<br>confidence with dean but the real issue<br>in that situation was that nicole<br>published personal information about<br>dean<br>in the public domain now on this<br>analysis<br>it doesn't matter that there's no<br>relationship in the claudia and graham<br>situation<br>because the personal information about<br>claudia was published<br>and that's the essence of the action<br>that's more of a privacy analysis<br>so the point i'm trying to make here is<br>that there's a fresh value call in this<br>new case<br>so even though we're applying a few or<br>earlier precedent<br>there's still something to decide do the<br>courts emphasize the breach of<br>confidence element<br>or do they emphasize privacy<br>this is how change can take place even<br>when the courts are applying previous<br>decisions<br>now there's a second element of the<br>common law that i want to mention before<br>we start in earnest<br>and that is that judgments often refer<br>to concepts like reasonableness<br>which appeal directly to societal values<br>i'm sorry in fact the core phrase in the<br>new zealand and english privacy torts<br>is a requirement that the claimant has a<br>reasonable expectation of privacy<br>and in the new zealand cases the<br>claimant also has to show that the<br>publicity<br>given to the information was highly<br>offensive to an objective reasonable<br>person<br>so we've got a bit of reasonableness<br>floating around in the privacy torts<br>and all this was established just as an<br>aside in a case called hosking and<br>renting<br>back in 2000 and in 2004 reported in<br>2005<br>and this is a case in which the mike<br>hosking successfully applied for an<br>injunction unsuccessfully applied sorry<br>for an injunction to prevent new idea<br>from publishing photographs of his 18<br>month daughters being<br>wheeled down a new market shopping<br>street uh although he was unsuccessful<br>a majority of the court accepted this<br>should be a tort of giving publicity to<br>private facts in new zealand i mean i<br>used to mention that case back in 2005<br>no one knew who mike hosking was<br>so his subsequent fame has been useful<br>for my um privacy classes<br>at that point he was a radio announcer<br>and um i put a photo of him up and<br>nobody recognized him<br>anyway in that judgment justice tipping<br>discussed the meaning of reasonableness<br>in the context of the two tests<br>on the slide on the first of the the<br>first of the two tests on the slide<br>he explained that reasonableness brings<br>into the common law and more<br>particularly into the privacy tests<br>an appeal to social norms oh sorry yeah<br>there we are<br>here he said what expectations of<br>privacy are reasonable<br>will be a reflection of the contemporary<br>societal of contemporary societal values<br>and the content of the law will in this<br>respect be capable of accommodating<br>changes<br>in those values the concept of<br>reasonableness<br>which appears throughout the common law<br>requires justice tipping as saying<br>that courts consider contemporary social<br>values when deciding the justice of the<br>case before them<br>now these discussions as we discussed<br>later can incorporate a range of matters<br>including just as an aside and modern<br>aotearoa maori values<br>and tikka so<br>the common law is a bottom-up system of<br>justice that is capable of changing even<br>though it kind of stays the same<br>and i want to talk in more detail about<br>three ways in which that change takes<br>place<br>focusing particularly a way that common<br>law reflects<br>and influences societal values<br>so i've got and i've got three<br>conversations between the common law and<br>society that i want to talk about the<br>first one i'm calling<br>the campaigning conversation the second<br>one is a conversation about<br>which involves the discovery of embedded<br>values<br>and the third is the search for<br>principle and coherence<br>and as i mentioned earlier i'm going to<br>talk about the role of the academic<br>in those conversations as we go through<br>so let's begin with the campaigning<br>conversation<br>so in this first conversation the<br>academic takes on<br>the role of the campaigner and what i<br>mean by this<br>is that the commentator is trying to get<br>the common law<br>to recognize and respond to some kind of<br>unprotected societal need<br>this is where this privacy conversation<br>was when i first encountered it<br>so i first learned about the law of<br>privacy as an undergraduate at<br>canterbury in the mid-1990s<br>and it was when i was studying media law<br>with the great teachers and scholars<br>john burroughs and ursula chief whom i'm<br>delighted to see is here this evening<br>those were pre-internet days but the<br>tabloids were in their heyday even<br>less constrained in their behaviour than<br>they are now i think the hounding of<br>princess diana<br>the salacious and gratuitous outing of<br>gay mps revelations of affairs not just<br>by celebrities but of the vicar and the<br>parishioner as well<br>and unchecked paparazzi activity<br>including famously<br>a photograph of aloha lo actor gordon<br>kay lying<br>seriously injured with a head injury in<br>a hospital bed<br>now part of the reason that this was<br>able to go on was because at that stage<br>legally<br>privacy was still very much in the<br>shadows<br>what i learned in john and ursula's<br>course was that in new zealand there had<br>been a few<br>bold high court judgments recognizing<br>privacy's importance<br>but the privacy had failed to make its<br>way into the bill of rights act 19 19<br>1990 and there was limited societal<br>discourse around its importance still<br>in england there were also some common<br>law steps being taken but<br>recommendations for greater legislative<br>protection or privacy had been rejected<br>time and time again politicians had<br>worked out that it was more than their<br>career was worth<br>to then to upset the immensely powerful<br>tabloid press<br>who are unsurprisingly not particularly<br>open to any suggestion<br>that their freedom to continuing<br>publishing privacy and fringing material<br>should be curtailed<br>the plushange all this piqued my<br>interest straight away i found it<br>concerning that both the legislature and<br>the common law<br>had seemed unable to respond to what i<br>saw as the commodification<br>of people's lives particularly when<br>those people were innocent of any<br>wrongdoing and in some cases<br>injured vulnerable or traumatized<br>it seemed that the way that people were<br>being used not being treated by as<br>people but as things whose personal<br>traumas or secrets could be laughed at<br>or made money out of<br>was at least as harmful as other long<br>wrongs that the law was<br>prepared to remedy<br>now in those days one of the biggest<br>objections to the recognition of privacy<br>protection<br>was the argument that privacy is<br>impossible to define<br>and as a result the scope of any legal<br>action would be too uncertain<br>this refrain was repeated by lawmakers<br>all over the commonwealth<br>and it did a great deal to arrest the<br>development of the action<br>particularly given that there was a<br>well-articulated right to freedom of<br>expression<br>seen as competing with privacy on the<br>other side<br>but what i want to give you as an<br>example of the role of the academic as a<br>campaigner<br>relates to the task of defining that<br>privacy interest<br>because in the 1970s 80s and 90s a group<br>of philosophers and jurists<br>now in the us in the 1960s and 70s<br>william cross's famous articulation of a<br>four-part privacy tort<br>was accepted by most states and at the<br>same time<br>an implied right to privacy in the<br>american constitution<br>formed the basis of the hugely<br>significant supreme court decisions on<br>access to contraception<br>and to abortion i.e rowan wade<br>this gave rise to a flurry of writing in<br>that jurisdiction<br>about what privacy is and why it's<br>important<br>now although these writers didn't always<br>agree they began to construct a language<br>with which privacy interests could be<br>analyzed and described<br>and which advocates could use to<br>now the theorist richard parker had a<br>nice articulation of the enterprise<br>that these scholars were engaged in<br>he explained that what he was looking<br>for was a definition of privacy<br>that what he said fits the data meaning<br>that it should reflect our shared<br>intuitions of when privacy is<br>or is not gained or lost<br>in other words he said what the<br>theorists are trying to do<br>is to put into words a value which<br>people had intuitively understood<br>but which had not yet been fully<br>articulated<br>this is important because if we're going<br>to protect an interest in the law<br>then we need language to identify<br>precisely what it is<br>and why it's important so what were<br>these theorists saying<br>well i first found that out on another<br>stage of my career growing up in the<br>private with the privacy torts<br>and that was in 1999 when i began my phd<br>in cambridge<br>my phd had the working title privacy and<br>the common law<br>even though the point at which i<br>embarked upon it there was no express<br>recognition of privacy in the common law<br>anywhere<br>in the commonwealth and i was supervised<br>by the late tony ware<br>who had a reputation as a formidable<br>critic even when he didn't think that<br>the student's enterprise was flawed<br>which he did with privacy his trinity<br>college obituary which i stumbled on<br>again after<br>during a recent office sort out said<br>tony's supervision style could be<br>intimidating for the faint of heart<br>well i'm afraid i have to admit to you<br>anyway when i had the courage to do it i<br>saw that my first job in writing a<br>thesis on privacy<br>was to begin by defining what privacy<br>meant and why it was important<br>so drawing on the theorists i just<br>described the writing of people like<br>stanley ben ruth gavison<br>and charles freed i decided that what we<br>mean when we talk about privacy in new<br>zealand and england my two home<br>jurisdictions was<br>a freedom from unwanted access to our<br>physical bodies into information about<br>ourselves<br>and in order to protect this people<br>needed an ability to retreat<br>from the inquiry and observation of<br>others if and when they wanted to<br>i also decided looking at these um<br>at these theorists work that privacy had<br>two components<br>freedom from people finding things out<br>about you which is what i call<br>informational privacy<br>and freedom from what i called unwanted<br>physical access<br>which is being looked at<br>listen to or physically encroached upon<br>against one's wishes<br>so privacy then is the ability to say<br>that sometimes you don't want to be<br>looked at or found out about<br>or recorded against your wishes that you<br>want to retreat into the company of<br>intimates<br>now that theoretical literature also<br>helped answer the second question i was<br>interested in at that stage<br>and that is why is privacy important why<br>do we as a society<br>value it well that literature explained<br>that the intuitive response that i had<br>had to the exposure of people's lives in<br>the media<br>and now online is grounded in concern<br>about the dignity and autonomy<br>of the individual concerned i recognize<br>that to look at<br>listen to find out about a person<br>against his or her wishes<br>and to public private matters purely for<br>your own purposes<br>is to treat a person as a means to your<br>end<br>and one of my favorite articles stanley<br>benn explains this by talking about why<br>an onlooker objects to henry higgins<br>recording eliza doolittle without her<br>knowledge in the play<br>pygmalion or if hello might have like<br>made the film um<br>what's the film my fair lady thank you<br>that was a genuine question no and my<br>fair lady<br>what he said so he uses this example of<br>where eliza<br>eliza doodle is being recorded in the<br>market against without without no<br>without knowing by henry higgins what<br>stanley says about this is that higgins<br>fails to show a proper respect for<br>persons<br>he's treating people as objects or<br>specimens like dirt<br>and not subjects with sensibilities ends<br>and aspirations of their own<br>these resentments he says suggest a<br>possible ground for a prima facie claim<br>not to be watched<br>at any rate in the same manner as one<br>watches a thing or an animal<br>for this is to take liberties to act<br>immediately to show less than a proper<br>regard<br>now you're not going to find these<br>commentators like stanley ben<br>referred to in the privacy cases but i<br>think their work has been hugely<br>important<br>and shifting the narrative that privacy<br>can't be defined<br>it's also clearly helped shape the legal<br>definition of the interest whether<br>directly<br>or indirectly courts both in england and<br>new zealand<br>have recognized that the protection of<br>privacy is about<br>the dignity and autonomy of the<br>individual they've said that expressly<br>in the leading cases of campbell and<br>hosking and renting here<br>and in new zealand at least the two<br>components which i described<br>informational and physical privacy are<br>reflected in two torts<br>which the courts have recognized there's<br>the publicity tour which i mentioned<br>before<br>which protects against the publication<br>of private information<br>and then there's the tort of intruding<br>on solitude and seclusion<br>which focuses on unwanted looking<br>the idea of retreat and inaccessibility<br>which was central to much of this<br>writing<br>also provided a conceptual framework on<br>which an exposure-focused<br>legal action could be built my favorite<br>articulation of these ideas was put<br>forward by justice tipping<br>whom i was lucky enough to work for as a<br>judge's clerk at the court of appeal<br>not long before he and all his fellow<br>judges morphed into the newly minted<br>supreme court there were just three<br>clerks for the whole court in those days<br>and so we got to work with different<br>judges on different cases which was a<br>great learning experience<br>for the clerks anyway not long after i<br>left that<br>role just as tipping said in hosting and<br>running that it's of the essence of the<br>dignity and personal autonomy<br>and well-being of all human beings that<br>some aspects of their lives should<br>remain private if they so wish<br>even people whose work or the public<br>nature of whose activities make them a<br>form of public profit at property<br>must be able to protect some aspects of<br>their lives<br>from scrutiny so there it is<br>i think in accessibility the idea of the<br>need for retreat<br>in the new zealand common law and so i<br>think we can assume<br>directly or indirectly that the<br>campaigning of these<br>so that's the first conversation with<br>the common law one where the commentator<br>is kind of acting as an advocate for the<br>greater recognition of a societal value<br>the second conversation focuses more on<br>the content of the common law itself<br>in this conversation commentators judges<br>and lawyers<br>look at the common law and discover<br>principles lying dormant<br>now as i've already discussed the common<br>law is bottom-up jurisprudence<br>where the judge is concerned principally<br>with a just outcome for the two parties<br>between them but as i also said the<br>judge always gives reasons<br>for their conclusions and over time the<br>collective wisdom in those<br>reasons builds up into principles and<br>legal rules<br>now usually these principles are obvious<br>but sometimes there's a slight bend in<br>the road that's being taken<br>which will only be perceived if you're<br>looking for it quite carefully<br>and sometimes once you spot it you'll<br>see that this little bend can in fact<br>take the law in a whole new direction<br>now the lawyers in the audience will be<br>able to think of examples of<br>where these new roads have been<br>discovered principles of negligence<br>early last century principles of<br>judicial review<br>restitution in the 80s and 90s and now i<br>would suggest<br>privacy<br>now throughout the decades the<br>importance of privacy has been<br>implicitly recognized in all sorts of<br>common law actions<br>it's cropped up a nuisance and<br>trespassed to the person and trespass to<br>goods and land<br>and cases on copyright and photographs<br>letters and other papers<br>and most significantly it's been there<br>lying dormant and breach of confidence<br>now you might recall when i was<br>discussing the hypothetical disclosure<br>by me of dean's letter<br>that the essence of breach of confidence<br>has traditionally been on the<br>circumstances in which the information<br>was<br>disclosed now the action<br>traditionally had three requirements one<br>of which was that one<br>the first one was that the information<br>in question was confidential<br>which just meant that it wasn't<br>generally known<br>the second one was the obligation was<br>imparted in circumstances importing an<br>obligation of confidence<br>and the third one was that there was an<br>unauthorized use of the information to<br>the detriment<br>of the confider now the first and third<br>were usually pretty easy to establish<br>and were kind of gradually dispensed<br>with by the courts as they<br>extended breach of confidence into a<br>privacy action<br>the key one was the second one the<br>requirement that the information was<br>imparted<br>and circumstances giving rise to an<br>obligation of confidence<br>now this obligate requirement had<br>traditionally been satisfied only when<br>there was some kind of formal ongoing<br>relationship between the parties<br>like doctor patient priest and penitent<br>husband and wife to use the language of<br>the old cases<br>but because of the nature of the<br>information but because the nature of<br>the information confided in the course<br>of these relationships<br>was often private it also went a long<br>way towards protecting privacy<br>as long as those relationships were in<br>place so to refer back to the duchess of<br>sussex<br>example which wendy mentioned an<br>introduction if the newspaper<br>published a heartfelt letter that<br>somebody had written to their father<br>then breach of confidence would provide<br>a remedy because of the nature of the<br>relationship between the parties<br>but that would also have the incidental<br>effect of protecting the private<br>information in the letter<br>from reaching the public domain now<br>commentators and judges and lawyers<br>saw this bend in the road and recognized<br>that it had the potential to fill a<br>privacy-sized gap in the law<br>and over time the bend got bigger until<br>eventually<br>the focus of the relationship<br>requirement moved<br>simply to ask whether the circumstances<br>were such<br>that the person who published the<br>information should have known<br>now lord goff explained the result of<br>these extensions in a famous house of<br>lords decision called<br>spy catcher after the name of a book<br>which a former mi5 intelligence officer<br>was wishing to publish<br>in the uk much to the chagrin of his<br>former employers<br>now lord goff said that when he<br>he was articulate he but he articulated<br>what the breach of confidence<br>action required in that case and he said<br>i've expressed the circumstances in<br>which the duty of confidence arises in<br>broad terms<br>to include certain situations beloved of<br>law teachers i'm not<br>sure what he meant by that but i'm sure<br>we'll take it as a compliment<br>actually he used to be one so we kind of<br>been that bad um<br>situations beloved of law teachers where<br>an obviously confidential document is<br>wafted by an electric fan<br>out of a window into a crowded street or<br>where an obviously confidential document<br>such as a private diary<br>or claudia's hypothetical letter is<br>dropped in a public place<br>and then picked up by a passerby<br>breach of confidence will now protect<br>you because the information in question<br>lord goff had decided that the essence<br>of liability and the action wasn't<br>necessarily the relationship between the<br>parties<br>wasn't necessarily even the<br>circumstances in which it was disclosed<br>rather the essence of the action could<br>be the nature of the information<br>which had been public published<br>now that shift left the door wide open<br>so this is where the english law was<br>when i first encountered it<br>it just needed that one last nudge to<br>get it to recognize that a new privacy<br>interest had emerged from<br>reach of confidence needed a nudge to<br>recognize that the bend in the road<br>had actually created a new cause of<br>action<br>and then the nudge came so back to my<br>theme of growing up with the privacy<br>taught so just before i arrived and came<br>we should do my llm<br>in 1998 the year before i did my thesis<br>tony blair's labor government had just<br>enacted the human rights act<br>which incorporated the european<br>convention on human rights into domestic<br>law<br>the european convention was drawn up in<br>the aftermath of world war ii<br>and it now binds a group called the<br>council of europe which is often<br>confused for the european union<br>but is a separate entity with much wider<br>membership including russia and turkey<br>and various others<br>importantly for our purposes article a<br>to the convention confers on citizens<br>of member states a right to respect for<br>private life<br>and here it is everyone has the right to<br>respect for his private and family life<br>his home<br>and his correspondence now there was a<br>huge amount of buzz about that when i<br>arrived in cambridge<br>much of it focused on whether this might<br>finally lead to the protection of<br>privacy which people have been<br>advocating for<br>for so long commentators academics<br>practitioners<br>judges writing extrajudicially we're<br>pushing forward this conversation<br>showing not just why it should happen<br>but also how<br>and i was introduced to all of this on<br>the cambridge ll.m<br>and the civil liberties course by<br>another canterbury graduate professor<br>ath smith<br>who of course went on to become dean<br>here at vuw<br>and more significantly on a personal<br>level my father-in-law<br>in fact i'm wearing his gown which i'm<br>uh which is strangling me gradually as<br>we<br>now what tony taught us in that course<br>was that section six of the human rights<br>act said<br>that the public authorities which<br>included the courts<br>needed to act compatibly with the<br>so all the buzz in the articles that i<br>was talking about was about an argument<br>which english courts ultimately accepted<br>that section 6 should be interpreted to<br>mean that the courts had to act<br>compatibly with the principles of the<br>convention<br>when they developed the common law so<br>the privacy context<br>they said that meant they had to act<br>compatibly with the principles with the<br>right to respect for private life<br>when they were developing the common law<br>action of breach of confidence<br>now lord justice sidley said in a case<br>called douglas and hello that the human<br>rights act had thereby given the final<br>impetus<br>to develop breach of confidence into a<br>now for a while the courts retained the<br>label breach of confidence for this new<br>privacy protection<br>they fused the requirements of privacy<br>and confidence together<br>by saying that the claimant had to<br>establish a duty of confidence<br>but that in order to do so he or she had<br>to show that they had a reasonable<br>expectation of privacy<br>and respect of the information or<br>question or activity in question<br>this caused confusion for some time for<br>anybody looking at it from the outside<br>but eventually<br>a fully-fledged tort called misuse of<br>private information<br>emerged now this<br>tort has two main requirements<br>first that the claimant has to establish<br>a reasonable expectation of privacy and<br>respect of the information or activity<br>in question<br>and secondly any privacy interest has to<br>be weighed against a defendant's right<br>to freedom of expression<br>which is usually the interest on the<br>other side and which is usually<br>determined by reference to the public<br>interest in the information or material<br>so those of you with good memories of<br>the earlier slide will see this is<br>pretty<br>similar to the new zealand position<br>so there it was buried in the common law<br>all along<br>the very interest that the commentators<br>have been saying<br>needed more protection and i would<br>suggest it's not surprising<br>to find it there because the judges were<br>developing the common law in the same<br>societal context<br>that those commentators were writing in<br>so it's unsurprising that consciously or<br>unconsciously those same societal values<br>that the ferriss were recognizing had<br>made their way into the common law<br>as the judges decided the justice of<br>each case<br>before them just as the theorists were<br>doing in the wider societal context<br>somebody needed to identify that those<br>values were there<br>that in the desire to reach the right<br>decision in the cases before them<br>judges had implicitly or explicitly been<br>recognizing<br>now i accept that the influence of the<br>european convention and the development<br>of the english privacy taught undermines<br>my argument a bit<br>that the common law had buried within it<br>the right to privacy<br>and that it simply needed to be<br>discovered it's important however<br>i think that we don't over emphasize at<br>least the ongoing significance of that<br>springboard<br>which led to the interest coming into<br>the english common law<br>in fact lord justice sidley expressly<br>said in douglas on hello<br>that even without the human rights act<br>privacy should have been recognized as a<br>common law right<br>anyway now in that case the actors<br>michael douglas and catherine zeta-jones<br>sought to prevent<br>hello magazine from publishing<br>unauthorized photos of their wedding<br>they were planning to publish their own<br>photographs of the wedding the following<br>week that made them look good<br>and i've seen these photographs they<br>don't make them look good she's putting<br>cake in her mouth and one of them and<br>they're all grainy and not very nice<br>so they but because of that later<br>publication<br>they didn't get their injunction they<br>were left to a remedy in damages<br>but nonetheless it was the first case to<br>establish that a privacy action had<br>emerged from within breach of confidence<br>significantly for current purposes lords<br>justice sadly said in that case<br>that this was to say little that the<br>courts<br>say by the way of label that the courts<br>have not already said over the years<br>the law no longer needs to construct an<br>artificial relationship of<br>confidentiality between intruder and<br>victim<br>it can recognize privacy itself as a<br>principle drawn from the fundamental<br>value<br>of personal autonomy in other words<br>it was there all along<br>now that has developed that that's<br>reflected i think in the substantive<br>development<br>of the action because when we look at<br>the english talk we see that it's far<br>from<br>an enactment of the european convention<br>concept of private<br>life the right to respect for private<br>life from european convention<br>jurisprudence is a broad amorphous<br>concept<br>designed to be applied at supranational<br>level by a supervisory international<br>court<br>it's broad brush top-down reasoning<br>which was never intended to be adopted<br>wholesale<br>into the legal system of any member<br>state<br>rather member states are obliged to<br>protect the interests in the convention<br>in their own way<br>with a wide margin of appreciation<br>applying<br>and when it comes to the content of the<br>article 8 interest we see that article 8<br>protects a positive<br>liberty focused conception of privacy<br>which includes things as diffuse is the<br>right to be free from unwanted<br>photography<br>as the right to live a traveler gypsy<br>lifestyle to access information about<br>your adoptive parents<br>and to be free from noise pollution that<br>bears little resemblance<br>to the modern english privacy tour<br>new zealand law is similar we draw on<br>the u.s publicity and intrusion torts<br>when developing the requirements of our<br>privacy torts<br>but their cultural conditions are far<br>too different<br>for there to be in the normal course of<br>things and automatic following of<br>their jurisprudence in new zealand in<br>particular<br>i'm thinking of the way in which they<br>give they privilege<br>freedom of expression over other<br>interests i'm thinking of a case for<br>example<br>where the wrestler hulk hogan was<br>videoed against<br>without his knowledge in a sex tape and<br>he failed to get an injunction<br>to have that kept off the internet on<br>the grounds that there was a free speech<br>interest on the other side<br>he was left to his claimant damages<br>which was in the millions of dollars<br>which then bankrupted the person who<br>um published it the organ news<br>organization which published it<br>so with very different values to those<br>that we find in our<br>in terms of applying the tort here what<br>we've done instead is to take the<br>requirements<br>of the u.s torts and to make them our<br>own fitting them into our<br>common law and developing them for our<br>societal conditions<br>now recognizing that the torts are<br>embedded in the common law like this has<br>some useful implications<br>first it makes it clear that the privacy<br>torch should not be seen as a swede<br>generous action<br>doing its own thing independent of other<br>common law principles<br>on the contrary both in england and here<br>i think it needs to take its place<br>properly amongst the common law family<br>fitting in with other actions like<br>defamation<br>and trespass and applying common law<br>principles about matters like remedies<br>now this means that there needs to be<br>caution i think as the actions come of<br>age<br>that they don't run roughshod over<br>carefully drawn protections<br>and other actions there's currently<br>much discussion in england for example<br>about the extent to which<br>privacy can provide redress for<br>claimants trying to protect their<br>reputation<br>now this issue keeps coming up because<br>there have been multiple cases in which<br>people who have been subject of<br>investigation by the police<br>have claimed that the privacy right<br>should aid them<br>to keep that private in order to protect<br>their reputation<br>and i see to see a need for caution here<br>of where to avoid allowing defendants to<br>circumvent<br>the carefully drawn up free speech<br>protections drawn up in defamation over<br>the centuries<br>which have applied to these cases which<br>say that the<br>material is private would often in fact<br>protect the free speech interest on the<br>privacy i think needs to learn to get on<br>with its older defamation brother<br>and with trespass while we're at it and<br>join the common law fully fledged the<br>criminal family<br>second once we look past the springboard<br>of the human rights act<br>and the u.s privacy talk which was<br>relied on in developing the new zealand<br>torts<br>we see that new zealand and english<br>thoughts of privacy have a lot more in<br>common<br>than they do differences first they're<br>operating in societies which at least as<br>far as pakeha values are concerned<br>share many cultural norms and values<br>including the starting point that<br>freedom of expression doesn't trump<br>other important issues of support of<br>values<br>and at the heart of both actions is also<br>this idea<br>that the central question is that the<br>claimant had a reasonable expectation of<br>privacy<br>and the need to to work out how that<br>interest<br>should be weighed against the public<br>interest in the information on the other<br>side<br>now the upshot of this the fact that we<br>have essentially the same tests<br>operating the reasonable expectation of<br>privacy on the one hand and the public<br>interest on the other<br>is it two jurisdictions have a great<br>deal to learn from each other when<br>they're applying those tests<br>particularly it has to be said new<br>zealand from england given the much<br>greater volume of case law<br>that we have in that jurisdiction that<br>they have in that jurisdiction<br>finally and just really as an aside<br>recognizing<br>that privacy is an emanation of the<br>common law<br>helps to insulate the<br>the tort from the disruptive effects<br>that departure from<br>european institutes institutions might<br>otherwise have<br>some of you might be aware that the tory<br>party in england has for some time been<br>threatening to abolish the human rights<br>act<br>and even to leave the council of europe<br>so that it's not bound<br>by the european convention on human<br>rights at all<br>recognising that privacy is actually a<br>common law<br>creature helps insulate us from the<br>disruptive effects<br>that such departures would otherwise<br>have<br>so discovering a new value within the<br>common law<br>is the second way that the legal<br>academic and judges and lawyers<br>so that brings me to the third and final<br>conversation<br>which i'm calling the search for<br>principle and coherence<br>now this one happens further down the<br>track in the new actions development<br>it becomes more relevant as the action<br>comes of age<br>now as i mentioned at least in england<br>there are now dozens<br>and dozens of cases in which the courts<br>have determined<br>when something is private whether it's<br>private and when the privacy interest<br>needs to yield to another interest on<br>the other side<br>usually a competing public interest<br>now unsurprisingly analyzing that case<br>law gives us useful answers<br>about when something will and will not<br>be regarded as private<br>in fact i've argued that those cases<br>show that whether something is private<br>can be determined in the common law at<br>the first of those questions looks at<br>societal attitudes<br>to the information or activity in<br>question<br>it asks whether the information or<br>activity an issue is something which<br>most people<br>would think that you're entitled to keep<br>to yourself<br>now this is a very context specific<br>question but the courts have said this<br>will tend to be the case in certain<br>categories of situation<br>and those categories are useful when we<br>try to understand what the privacy<br>interest is<br>it includes things like sexual activity<br>and sexual expression<br>things to do with the naked body health<br>information<br>domestic intimacies the inner workings<br>the second question which i say is all<br>about signals<br>is more subjective it looks at the way<br>in which the claimant has behaved in<br>respect of the activity<br>question of activity or information and<br>question<br>did he cover that body part with clothes<br>if she wears a hijab did she cover it<br>did she cover her hair with a hijab<br>habitually<br>did she store the photographs on a<br>private device<br>did he go into his house and close the<br>door or he put up some other physical<br>barrier in front of the camera did he<br>duck behind the bushes<br>well conversely did the claim and post a<br>photograph of the activity publicly on<br>facebook<br>all of these things i say buried in the<br>case though<br>but also tell us a little bit about the<br>privacy interest they explain<br>that it's not just what everybody else<br>thinks is private but that also<br>the way that you treat the information<br>the signals that you give to the outside<br>world about how you treat the<br>information<br>are an important factor in determining<br>the scope of the privacy interest<br>or its application at least in the case<br>to you<br>now it's important that we identify<br>these kinds of principles in the common<br>law<br>because people need to know in advance<br>how the law will apply to them<br>and this is particularly important when<br>we have free speech interests on the<br>other side<br>if editors are unsure about what the law<br>does and doesn't cover<br>then the danger is that public interest<br>disclosures won't see the light of day<br>because even though the law would have<br>protected them so it's called<br>so it's important that the law is<br>sufficiently clear to give a degree of<br>clarity<br>but this attempt to bring clarity in the<br>common law is not just an internal<br>conversation<br>but because the law doesn't just respond<br>to societal values<br>it shapes them as well i've already<br>described the ways in which the common<br>law has responded<br>to societal discourse on privacy<br>and it's important to emphasize as i get<br>near to concluding<br>that the common law has also pushed<br>forward those conversations<br>rather than just echoing them it drives<br>these common law cases for example have<br>highlighted the need<br>to recognize privacy as an important<br>societal interest<br>outside of the fact scenarios which the<br>cases typically deal with<br>this includes data protection policing<br>border control<br>and the workplace and i'm often struck<br>by the difference in societal discourse<br>now and when i began in fact when i<br>first encountered<br>and gay um embarked on my phd one of my<br>fellow new zealand phd<br>students said or um at least i've got a<br>topic was talking to me about how<br>i didn't have it i think he um he<br>investigated some arcane<br>um aspects of the law of equity so i'm<br>sure that's all<br>not a whole lot of societal discourse<br>about that one either but um<br>but it is striking how much things have<br>shifted from<br>from at the beginning when we had no<br>common law protection to the situation<br>that we're in now where privacy is being<br>talked about in all of these different<br>contexts<br>as well and i think it's important to<br>see the development of the common law<br>action as part of that societal<br>conversation<br>what's more i think because we've<br>reached a point now where<br>the common law provides useful guidance<br>on the nature of<br>that societal privacy interest both in<br>the media context where most of the<br>cases are decided but in some of those<br>wider social contexts<br>as well that includes for example by<br>making it clear<br>that privacy has a an objective and a<br>subjective interest<br>principles which i think are embedded in<br>the common law<br>cases<br>so that brings us full circle<br>having started off by saying that<br>privacy was too ill-defined to form the<br>basis of common law protection<br>we're now in a position where the common<br>law is helping define<br>the societal interest<br>and that brings you back to the<br>convergence of my two legal loves<br>the development of the law of privacy is<br>pr has pushed the common law<br>to protect an interest more subtle than<br>it's ever recognized before<br>and this shows not only its ability to<br>respond to social change<br>but also to guide it by recognizing the<br>importance of these very human interests<br>in the face of increasingly significant<br>threats<br>now i've found that a hugely stimulating<br>process<br>to have been a part of but i couldn't<br>have done it<br>and wouldn't continue to do it if i<br>didn't also believe it to be<br>very important so curato<br>thank you so much thank you professor<br>nicole morum<br>for a bold and challenging inaugural<br>lecture<br>conversations with the common law<br>i've been fortunate and blessed to know<br>nicole for a number of years now<br>i think you would all agree in terms of<br>what you've heard<br>someone who is a global specialist in<br>her field<br>who is reflected upon<br>a number of jurisdictions that inform<br>her insights and scholarship<br>she did refer to the concepts<br>of penumbra effectively by adverting to<br>row against wade<br>and the united states constitutional<br>fabric its own distinct cultures<br>and how that could be related to<br>finding buried values in our own common<br>law<br>as her preferred way of understanding<br>how those values are embedded<br>and the privacy interest was always<br>there<br>as one of her slides said and she<br>mediated this through the theme of three<br>conversations<br>and there was much to do about lived<br>interaction<br>the semiotics of privacy the fact these<br>are<br>signals and there are communications<br>that are ongoing<br>i think it is appropriate to notice that<br>nicole moram has told us a story of<br>araha<br>of love courtesy and care<br>woven with an abiding sense of whanau<br>for knowing a tonga<br>one's kin community we see<br>that kin community here this evening<br>we see it in tim and the children<br>and the extended family we see it in the<br>intellectual<br>community that she shares with each and<br>every one of us<br>we've even heard members of it spoken of<br>in terms of the lived present in the<br>past<br>references to ursula chair who is here<br>from canterbury<br>and what i believe professor morum has<br>given us this evening then is a moment<br>a moment to inhabit and absorb<br>a sense of the common law lived and<br>conversed with very eloquently by a<br>world-class expert<br>we're enormously appreciative nicole<br>moram and thank you for being a member<br>of this community of scholars<br>at te haranga waka victoria university<br>of wellington<br>before we have any refreshments in the<br>foyer<br>please join me in thanking our colleague<br>professor nicole moram<br>again for an entirely memorable<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
