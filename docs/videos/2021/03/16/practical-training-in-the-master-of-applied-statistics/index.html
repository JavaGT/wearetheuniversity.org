And it's focused on a particular  <br>job area that you may go into after graduating.<br>What we teach them in the course is communicating <br>with clients. How to approach a knowledge analysis  <br>project. How to make sure that when you talk to <br>a client you actually determine exactly what they  <br>want to find out, and help them answer to the <br>question that they want answered. Rather than  <br>to answer the question that you want to answer <br>yourself, and that takes a lot of practice.<br>What I've learned so far is stats is more <br>than just like going away and typing out  <br>numbers and trying to find correlations. <br>It's more like talking talking to people so  <br>you've actually got to be able to talk to <br>someone in like terms that they can understand.<br>It teaches you how to communicate technical <br>information in simple layman terms and in  <br>a coherent way. But the only way you can do <br>that is if you understand the fundamentals,  <br>if you understand the background. Which <br>is what the other courses provide.<br>One of my favorite parts of <br>the course so far was meeting  <br>with the actual client at Wellington Hospital.<br>When we met with our client it was really <br>nerve-wracking at first but as it went on  <br>we kind of gained more confidence and <br>we started asking him more questions.  <br>And he noticed that patients that were discharged <br>from ICU that had cancer tended to die more  <br>quickly than patients that hadn't had cancer. <br>Even though when they were admitted to ICU  <br>the cancer was not the reason they were there. So <br>because of this he he needed to seek a consultant.<br>What I learned from that process is <br>listening is very key. When it comes to  <br>university you know you can listen in class <br>but if you don't you can always go back to  <br>your notes and refer to them at home, but when it <br>comes to these consultation sessions you have to  <br>listen to your client's problem and <br>dissect what he's trying to say.<br>We've gone away and we've we've got this this data <br>that we're meant to analyze and it's sort of like  <br>the questions that we've been reading <br>about the last I don't know four or  <br>five years of our university life, but <br>we're finally actually doing something  <br>where I finally actually got a new problem that <br>nobody's solved. So it's sort of this course  <br>sort of expects you, as most would when you get <br>to masters level, is it sort of expects you to  <br>already know how to solve problems. And sort of <br>expect you to have a toolbox to use to solve it.<br>Rather than us learning a skill and practicing <br>it and practicing it and then applying it to  <br>an exam or something this is real people and <br>this is real data and it's important. He wants  <br>to have a publication out of this so we need <br>to know what we're doing. And I think that's  <br>an invaluable experience for us it's going <br>to help us so much later on in the future.<br>The students have indicated that the the aspect <br>of combining lectures and practical experience  <br>with clients is actually quite useful and they've <br>learned a lot from that. And this was one of the  <br>aims of really setting up the course to give them <br>the skills necessary so that when they go into the  <br>work environment they have practiced this. And <br>in a way these are things that I wish I knew  <br>myself when I started working, and it's something <br>that we want to transfer and teach the students.<br>What we've gained from this program has <br>just been incredible. We've learned how  <br>to work together in a team, we've learned <br>how to consult with like important people,  <br>and soon in the future we're going <br>to be thrown into the deep end  <br>and we'll be working in an actual <br>company which I think is just invaluable.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
