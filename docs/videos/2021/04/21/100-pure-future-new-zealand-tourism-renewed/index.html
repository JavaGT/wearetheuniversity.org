pleased to be<br>here today thanks<br>everyone for tuning in um i have the<br>briefest of introductions i'm afraid to<br>uh for our authors our esteemed authors<br>if you want their full<br>biographies um you could buy a copy of<br>the book and you would find them in full<br>at the end<br>but you're delighted today to have three<br>of the authors of 100<br>pure future um in uh presenting today<br>uh we've got emeritus professor dave<br>david simmons<br>of lincoln university who is a<br>specialist in destination management and<br>yield<br>our second speaker is professor susana<br>beckham<br>uh professor of sustainable tourism at<br>griffith university<br>and a leader in climate change and<br>energy use<br>and tourism and our third speaker is<br>dave bamford erstwhile national park<br>ranger<br>with more than 30 years experience in<br>sustainable<br>tourism development in particular<br>related<br>christian if i could have my first slide<br>please<br>so why this book and why now<br>well over the last 20 years i have been<br>writing travel<br>exclusively about new zealand for<br>various media outlets<br>at home and abroad and this includes<br>christian says for<br>for lonely planet um and also yeah for<br>various<br>media outlets at home and abroad now<br>this as you can imagine has been a<br>pretty awesome uh career path it's taken<br>me down an awful lot of<br>road-ins i feel like i've spoken to a<br>lot of visitors<br>i've spoken to a lot of operators i feel<br>like i've spoken to a lot of taxi<br>drivers and people who are walking their<br>dog<br>along the local riverbank it's been a<br>lot of conversations during that time<br>and personally i found it increasingly<br>hard to<br>reconcile the costs and the benefits of<br>tourism<br>to aotearoa to its natural places to its<br>people but also<br>to the planet and of course i was hardly<br>alone in my concern<br>into the pandemic and in those early<br>days when the plane stopped<br>coming there were a lot of urgent and<br>very passionate conversations<br>um about tourism and what it meant to<br>aotearoa<br>and i think a fairly universally held<br>view emerged that<br>we needed to reset reimagine<br>uh or renew now um<br>tom rene is the publisher of bridget<br>williams books and he and i had<br>discussions about the uh the challenges<br>of tourism<br>and the need for it to be sustainable<br>above all else and tom suggested to me<br>that<br>a collection of essays in the bwb text<br>series might help<br>mobilize this issue for new zealanders<br>and take it to a wider audience<br>so i reached out to potential authors<br>and they said yes<br>and so today you're going to hear from<br>three of them<br>christian if i could have my next slide<br>please<br>now here's the table of contents for the<br>book forgive<br>me um for those of you who've actually<br>already read it<br>now look you'll see rod aurum in there<br>you'll know his jam by now he's a<br>business journalist<br>unwaveringly optimistic and in this book<br>he assesses the economic<br>opportunities of a regenerative tourism<br>model<br>we've got tanahi waniko tumuaki of<br>tongariromonga<br>and he outlines the principles of manaki<br>tangata<br>and manaki fenua caring for the people<br>and caring for the land and why those<br>principles are the bedrock<br>not just of tourism but of the whole<br>world that we live in<br>now tony wheeler is here too tony<br>wheeler is my old boss<br>at lonely planet and he shares the<br>valuable view<br>of an inveterate world traveler and in a<br>q a style essay we talk about things<br>like over tourism<br>we talk about the opportunities for new<br>zealand going forward<br>but we also talk about why travel<br>actually matters why do we love to<br>travel now many readers have told me<br>that ernest speakerbosch's voice<br>is the strongest in the book now um some<br>of you may know that um<br>erna and her husband tony have owned and<br>operated a holiday park in queenstown<br>for 35 years and erna was way ahead of<br>the curve she's always<br>focused on the environment but also on<br>the people that she<br>hosts and employs and in fact earner<br>once remarked to me that she doesn't run<br>a business she runs a social service<br>and i love this quote from her essay<br>we've always paid higher than the<br>minimum wage<br>our staff knew where they would work<br>they knew what they would earn<br>and they knew where they would live uh<br>rowan pierre from the environmental<br>defense society<br>recaps the uh well-traversed ground of<br>the negative<br>effects of tourism on our natural world<br>and she examines the need for<br>strength and governance and management<br>to mitigate those effects and of course<br>we've got hugh logan ex-director general<br>of doc<br>he brilliantly summarises the books<br>kaupapa<br>and articulates some ways in which we<br>might<br>improve the industry now i contribute an<br>opening essay which on reflection<br>is a little bit emotional and i make no<br>apology for that<br>i did write it towards the end of last<br>year now<br>i s my husband lia and i we spent<br>lockdown<br>for six weeks over lockdown in the tiny<br>waikato<br>town of kaffir which is tainui country<br>six weeks there and then not long after<br>we were liberated from lockdown we went<br>to queenstown<br>where we spent another six weeks<br>queenstown and the doldrums at that time<br>as you can imagine<br>these two places were very different but<br>very interesting places to<br>ponder the future of tourism<br>and more than ever for me it seems<br>impossible to<br>separate tourism's problems from the<br>world's problems<br>we've got the continual extraction of<br>natural resources<br>and the growing carbon emission to a<br>point that's now<br>way beyond sustainable we've got a low<br>wage economy in which we ask<br>more and more of our workers for wages<br>that have all but<br>stagnated we've got a lack of housing<br>with all of the social problems that<br>brings<br>we've got a growing burden of aging<br>and inadequate civic infrastructure<br>which becomes<br>which is particularly pertinent to<br>tourism<br>when rate payers and taxpayers are asked<br>to<br>uh pay for infrastructure that they<br>perceive doesn't directly benefit them<br>or align with their values<br>then we have the amassing of profits to<br>overseas<br>corporations many of whom will be<br>completely unaware of the concepts of<br>manaki tangata and manaki fenua<br>and then of course all this leads to a<br>growing inequality gap<br>and it's now a commonly held view that<br>tourism contributes considerably<br>to that inequality and i'm reminded of<br>that often um in the conversations i<br>have recently with fairly wealthy<br>friends<br>who can afford to travel they talk about<br>their freedom to travel<br>about their right to travel and about<br>their need<br>to see the world but that's a privilege<br>right and who pays for that<br>now some reasons to be cheerful in the<br>last 12 months we've learned the real<br>value of domestic tourism and the power<br>of spending our money<br>and local businesses we finally got to<br>grips with this concept that we should<br>book direct and why we should do that<br>um some other positive news our media<br>outlets have swung right and behind<br>uh our efforts um sure stuff on the<br>herald have been subsidised to do that<br>but it's been very powerful and how<br>stuff pulling its facebook presence<br>it's just so courageous i'm also<br>personally pretty excited about the<br>rampant sales<br>of outdoor gear the backpacks the<br>tramping boots the bicycles<br>i choose to believe that this will<br>directly translate<br>to a greater appreciation of total<br>our natural world then there's the sale<br>of the sales of new zealand books new<br>zealand book sales are booming<br>and we're not just talking about the<br>luminaries selling through the hokataka<br>paper plus<br>we're talking about vincent o'malley's<br>new zealand wars<br>and we're talking about a collection of<br>essays about decolonization and again<br>i like to think that this will translate<br>into a deeper understanding<br>of our history and of our culture and of<br>our environment<br>so why does this matter what's the<br>opportunity here<br>well i'd wager that new zealanders have<br>never known their country better<br>they've never been as engaged in its<br>issues that we're as collective<br>as we've ever been we're a team of five<br>million<br>hiwaka ekanawa and this makes it the<br>perfect time<br>to harness that sense of collectivism to<br>make change for the greater<br>good improved tourism industry<br>is a vehicle for positive change for the<br>greater good<br>now early on in the pandemic when the<br>government was<br>pouring a whole lot of money into<br>various places of need<br>grant robertson i remember him saying<br>that we weren't just saving the economy<br>that we were nation building well<br>enter the tourism futures task force<br>here's an opportunity to build one of<br>our major industries back<br>better pretty exciting i felt pretty i<br>felt very optimistic especially when i<br>knew who was involved<br>and i wasn't disappointed when i read<br>the interim report<br>and unsurprisingly the task force<br>identified<br>some pretty big challenges and some<br>potential solutions<br>about how tourism is governed and<br>managed<br>and funded and what it and it wasn't<br>surprising really that some of those<br>recommendations<br>aligned with the parliamentary<br>commissioner for the environment and<br>they also aligned with the authors<br>of 100 pure future um it sounds<br>really to me it looks to me that when it<br>comes to sustainable tourism there's a<br>lot of people now singing<br>from the same song sheet the biggest<br>surprise here seemed to be<br>that the minister seems to have all but<br>pushed this report aside<br>to quote rod aurum once again the<br>government is failing to seize<br>the brilliant opportunities offered to<br>it by the people who live<br>we have three of those people here today<br>so without further ado i would like to<br>introduce david simmons<br>emeritus professor of tourism lincoln<br>university<br>cura sarah and kuroko cartoon<br>to our visitors today so i was<br>tasked in this book of um<br>the sort of opening formal chapter of<br>navigating the future<br>and finding new compass bearings and<br>very much as sarah has said much of this<br>is now being woven into<br>a abraded river a much bigger strand of<br>uh sort of compelling ideas<br>for the future so christian if we could<br>just go to the first slide<br>would be good and simply put<br>as christian said in his introduction<br>that new zealand tourism<br>was in trouble but sticking with the<br>idea of the compass bearings<br>who was navigating and so over the past<br>15 years we have seen<br>three different tourism strategies uh<br>well actually four now<br>one by the government one by a joint<br>government industry<br>then i sense led by frustrations a<br>the tourism 2025 growing<br>value together which was the tourism<br>industry<br>association's efforts in the space<br>for which i was one of the writing team<br>and more recently<br>a department of conservation and and mb<br>uh atro new zealand tourism strategy<br>the tourism 2025 strategy set out some<br>bold goals<br>and hopefully you can read the smaller<br>circles there but<br>what they talk about is uh well they<br>talk about insights in the middle<br>uh which is fascinating but they talk<br>about uh<br>productivity for profit they talk about<br>targeting for value<br>they talk obviously about visitor<br>satisfaction<br>and in the sense one of the only<br>mentions of sustainability<br>growing sustainable ear connectivity now<br>i still<br>wonder what that particularly means um<br>because having<br>spent a bit of time in mckenzie lately<br>and you look at the size of the pipes<br>coming off the dams i think if we have<br>uh very large volumes coming in it's<br>very hard to<br>adapt to them at the bottom of the<br>waterfall so the questions<br>that come up are questions sort of of of<br>control<br>and and how do we control tourism into<br>the future<br>and put our own compass bearings on it<br>what does surprise me<br>is that given global trends and some<br>exemplary performance by new zealand<br>the goal was to earn 41 billion dollars<br>by 2025.<br>well as my little superstar there uh<br>points out<br>we got to 40.9 billion<br>in 2019 now it should be a big question<br>mark in that uh<br>in that gap there once we hit that<br>target of value<br>as expenditure only but not as broader<br>sets of values what we were going to do<br>nowhere had i heard anyone talk about<br>trimming volumetric growth<br>or trimming expenditure or a broader<br>discussion of values<br>so we hit the we hit the expenditure<br>goal early<br>there was an absolute silence in the<br>both public sector and the private<br>sector<br>about what next other than more revenue<br>so um let's have a look at how this is<br>playing out if we go to the next site<br>please christian<br>so how were we doing now i've always<br>liked and we proposed this<br>a number of years ago when we did a<br>tourism planning toolkit that um<br>it's always a bit of fun to think about<br>tourism as being uh<br>the vice being in the vice sector and<br>what we mean by this is that we want to<br>welcome<br>involve and satisfy visitors they're at<br>the core of what we do<br>we need to have a profitable and<br>prosperous industry<br>the eye we need to engage and benefit<br>the community which is something we<br>haven't done very well<br>and early on i think in the early 2000s<br>we were writing about protecting<br>and enhancing the environment so that's<br>the visitors<br>industry community and environment<br>now when that's in the in the second<br>part of the slide<br>uh we were doing remarkably poorly even<br>in 2016 where i took these paper<br>clippings from<br>uh on all of these dimensions so for the<br>environment<br>overcrowding a growing issue in new<br>zealand's national park and that's a<br>2016 paper clipping of<br>what we all know the tongariro crossing<br>community<br>also 2016 tecapo locals abused by<br>freedom campus<br>a tourism expert claims interestingly<br>enough from an industry point of view<br>in the absence of dare i say it<br>really strong coordinated central<br>government<br>voice for tourism addressing new<br>zealand's<br>pressing local tourist infrastructure<br>needs was written<br>unbelievably by the airports because<br>the government was silent uh in this<br>space and not preparing for this<br>and lo and behold right in the middle of<br>this uh<br>there is the wonderful hooker track with<br>too much<br>of a good thing and i think uh for a<br>conference<br>uh we had in christchurch i did some<br>computed average growth models for the<br>future<br>and predicted that sort of by 2030 or so<br>there'd be 9600 people a day<br>on that hooker track unless we did<br>something about it<br>let's go to the next slide please<br>christian<br>so i sort of came up with four compass<br>bearings and i think<br>sierra would probably like me to say so<br>do do buy the book and<br>have a read of them all but the first<br>one<br>it relates to the map opposite which is<br>um why don't we think about using<br>tourism<br>as a purposeful development tool now as<br>a geographer i do like this map so let<br>me explain it just simply<br>the circles are the total amount of<br>expenditure<br>and inside the circle and the darker<br>orange is domestic expenditure<br>and in the lighter orange is the<br>international expenditure<br>so of the 16 regions in new zealand only<br>three of those<br>had greater international expenditure<br>than domestic<br>they were auckland and it has the big<br>airport and the gateway<br>and of course now the two regions we<br>know most in difficulty<br>are westland uh and queenstown lakes<br>um queenstown in the in the central<br>lakes<br>uh interestingly enough we have some<br>very very highly sort of<br>um domestic uh based regions north<br>london is one where you see the very<br>large<br>uh um dark uh okra<br>orange up there and of course we all<br>love to go north to follow the sun you<br>can see the same sort of effect in<br>nelson tasman but interestingly enough<br>if you draw a line from auckland to<br>wellington you will notice<br>at the taiwan a region which we know<br>where maori struggle where the<br>the community is not uh where the<br>economy is not very diverse<br>and a very very small dot that<br>represents tourism<br>or taranaki which we're trying to move<br>away from<br>uh hydrocarbon-based industries and yet<br>uh it's almost it's only an hour's<br>difference<br>in driving between wellington to<br>auckland to go via uh the manga<br>and look at their wonderful food and<br>beverage and<br>nature-based products so the question is<br>rather than just<br>accepting tourism what would be like<br>what would it be like if at a national<br>level<br>we directed it to places and communities<br>where there is greatest need being<br>mindful not to over<br>expose it to international tourists so<br>that's my first compass bearing<br>compass bearing two is that um<br>and susanna and i were part of this a<br>big piece of work<br>uh many years ago looking at the<br>financial economic and sustainable yield<br>of tourism<br>and i am delighted at one level that<br>we have shifted the conversation away<br>from numbers<br>but only as far as expenditure and so<br>um we need to shift the conversation<br>beyond expenditure as i've just said to<br>distribution<br>and to a phrase i like residual income<br>i'll give a very simple example of this<br>a<br>high net worth individual who flies into<br>auckland<br>jumps in a helicopter takes the chopper<br>across to<br>uh let's say tauranga uh plays a round<br>of golf<br>has a wagyu steak and some grand burge<br>for lunch<br>gets in the chopper flies back to<br>auckland and may have spent three or<br>four thousand dollars<br>has not done that much for the new<br>zealand economy<br>the chopper is important they have gas<br>imported the wagon state comes from<br>tasmania the grand bridge from france<br>and apart from uh a hopefully a sizable<br>tip for the caddy<br>uh the only and some wages for the<br>airline pilot<br>uh the the t rear may have simply have<br>got a crop dusting of carbon<br>now when we look at it in that sort of<br>exploded out sort of view<br>you can see that that is not the sort of<br>value proposition<br>that collectively we talk about in this<br>book we are talking about a populated<br>economy<br>we're talking about greater social<br>justice we're talking about<br>links to agri and food tourism that<br>support local businesses and local<br>communities<br>so we need to think about not being<br>passive in tourism<br>but being much more active and how we<br>control and manage it<br>the next two sets of of compass bearings<br>relate very very much to what's in the<br>tourism futures task force<br>and the first one is about the four<br>capitals<br>and regenerative tourism and so um<br>certainly get hold of the tourism<br>futures task force and read this<br>but the question is rather and this was<br>put so succinctly by eugenie sage at the<br>tourism industry association conference<br>about two and a half years ago<br>where does the idea that tourism just<br>takes from things<br>um really come from what does tourism<br>look like<br>that adds to repairs or even regenerates<br>or restores<br>natural capital look like what does it<br>look like when it engages well and<br>honestly with the workforce<br>uh or with maori culture and what does<br>good<br>um economic and financial profitability<br>look like<br>now those capitals i have got are<br>purposefully arranged as<br>a sort of geocentric circle um as<br>in keeping with the stockholm resilience<br>institute<br>but if we don't look after our natural<br>capital<br>we cannot look after our people and our<br>economy cannot prosper and in this sense<br>our response to government has been<br>quite right<br>look after our people and our nature<br>first and the economy is a servant of<br>both of us<br>not necessarily a driver so there's a<br>lot to be said<br>in there about what would it look like<br>to have tourism<br>that engages differently uh with the<br>economy<br>uh and and through that with resources<br>and people<br>and along the bottom a a small a<br>small diagram that we've got taking<br>extractive<br>this is a step above sustainable tourism<br>which is like a sustainable harvest do<br>no harm<br>but it is actually adding value to<br>restoring and regenerating places<br>and people along the itineraries final<br>okay now my great frustration<br>now is if the tourism futures task force<br>has been parked what on earth do we do<br>about implementation<br>i'm sure the airports and airlines uh<br>and the media all cock-a-hoop about<br>uh the 10 000 people who crossed the<br>tasman<br>yesterday or this week or or whatever<br>and that's important in terms of<br>families<br>but what have we got left with because<br>there seems to be a massive void<br>in a road map and the leave is going<br>future so i've just<br>is it destination management as put out<br>by mb in 2020<br>and then i looked at this diagram and it<br>talks about these three things a<br>holistic and integrated approach<br>visitor experience marketing and<br>promotion<br>and resource management um now uh<br>christian if you push the button some<br>numbers might come on<br>excuse me david i'm just signaling that<br>you are running out of time so maybe<br>another minute or two thank you<br>last couple of paragraphs then i think<br>this diagram is upside down<br>i would put resource management at the<br>top i would put<br>visitor experiences as the<br>as a sort of secondary one but marketing<br>and promotion is an implementation tool<br>the question is what sort of tourism do<br>we want<br>and therefore to implement that we<br>instruct our marketing agencies to find<br>those tourists<br>who take us closest to it so what is<br>needed to me<br>is new models of governance and new<br>models<br>new roles for governments including<br>particularly local authority and perhaps<br>the ministry of tourism<br>thank you sarah<br>thank you very much david greatly<br>appreciate it<br>um and i would now like to hand over to<br>susanna beckham susanna hi kia hi<br>everyone and um<br>yeah thanks for having me it's great uh<br>to keep this uh discussion alive uh<br>sarah<br>and uh victoria university um make sure<br>we<br>we we don't forget and um don't miss<br>this great opportunity that we have now<br>the chapter that sarah asked me to<br>contribute was on carbon<br>and i think sarah it was you who came up<br>maybe with this very clever title of um<br>being in there for the long haul<br>and there's two sides to this one is<br>obviously the long haul that we actually<br>want to have tourism for a very long<br>time to come<br>but the other one alludes to our<br>destination<br>as a as a long-haul um country and and<br>for that to continue to happen i think<br>it is absolutely critical that we<br>address<br>the aviation question and so without<br>that<br>um there simply won't be any<br>international long-haul travel in<br>in the long-term future and i explain<br>why but maybe i start first<br>by by picking up one of the<br>recommendations from the tourism future<br>task force um<br>and that was um and i just read it out<br>we will work to decarbonize tourism<br>hospitality and recreation and<br>demonstrate our contribution to the<br>improvement<br>of biodiversity within the next decade<br>and and that's going to be achieved<br>through these mechanisms like offsetting<br>for<br>native and permanent forest restoration<br>um<br>new aviation fuels um ideally uh those<br>that actually truly generate a carbon<br>benefits are not necessary biofuels but<br>maybe synthetic fuels<br>and of course our electrification of the<br>transport infrastructure so<br>these are imperatives and i think<br>regardless of what happens to the task<br>force report as a whole that<br>recommendation<br>stands as it is it has to be addressed<br>now last week there was a new report<br>that came out from the australian<br>climate council<br>and it is entitled aim high go fast<br>why emissions need to plummet this<br>decade<br>and it is really the first um to my<br>knowledge that<br>essentially provides the evidence that<br>we have locked ourselves in for the one<br>and a half degree warming<br>which is what we actually really wanted<br>to avoid um<br>the paris agreement talks about limiting<br>warming to two degrees but ideally one<br>and a half<br>there's quite a big difference even<br>between those now you might think it's<br>only half a degree but it makes a huge<br>difference<br>um and in fact um the report concludes<br>that every<br>every degree of avoided warming or every<br>er every fraction of a degree degree is<br>essentially measured<br>in in lives human lives species<br>and ecosystems and the authors expect<br>that we basically<br>have reached one and a half degrees by<br>2030<br>regardless what we do now we're locked<br>in and that has to do with some of the<br>heat that is stored in oceans<br>so even if we stop now it will be one<br>and a half and so we are on<br>on quite a path towards two degrees<br>three degrees and so the reason<br>i i label this a little bit is because<br>it is sometimes easy to just about give<br>up and say well it's too light<br>um but like these authors say every<br>warming that we avoid<br>increases our chances of of making a<br>difference in<br>in ensuring that some of those<br>irreversible changes are not happening<br>so personally i think two degrees is<br>still better than three degrees<br>and we definitely want to avoid anything<br>beyond that so<br>um action needs to to to happen<br>and accelerate and so on that note um<br>the authors also conclude that all this<br>talk about<br>net zero 2050 and you i mean even our<br>own targets but you would have seen<br>qantas for example announcing oh we will<br>be carbon<br>you know neutral by 2050 that's all not<br>relevant it's far too light<br>okay so so things need to happen in the<br>next decade<br>uh new zealand um is sort of<br>leading in the world in the sense that<br>we have a zero carbon<br>act um but we are lagging in the sense<br>that our actual targets are falling<br>short of what needs to be done and that<br>we don't have the<br>sort of underpinning a policy at this<br>point to actually deliver<br>so so that's a problem and that includes<br>aviation emissions um the climate<br>commission says that maybe in 24 2024 we<br>we consider what we do with<br>international aviation<br>um as we know it sits outside<br>existing policy frameworks scotland is<br>the only country in the moment<br>that actually includes international<br>aviation and germany and france are<br>talking about it<br>and it might be it might be a good idea<br>for new zealand to think<br>think the same and that's in our own<br>interest in in future proofing the<br>sector<br>enforcing the change that we need to<br>address um<br>a shift towards non-fossil fuel aviation<br>um quick comment on calvit<br>because some people say calvert is right<br>it stopped everything<br>um indeed it has reduced emissions for<br>the year 2020<br>and globally around seven percent drop<br>and in new zealand it was 12 or more<br>according to the carbon tracker so<br>that's so that's a very short um<br>stagnation if you want um or relief but<br>it's not a long-term effect effect<br>essentially when we think about the<br>government<br>stimulus that the resources that have<br>been invested and so the overall package<br>is 50 billion<br>which is about 15 of the value of the<br>economy<br>the key is really whether all that is<br>geared towards low carbon development<br>and so for the global government bailout<br>packages the the united nations did an<br>analysis and found<br>that only 18 percent of government<br>bailout was some form of green<br>bailout and with a rather generous um<br>assessment so um i think i think that<br>there's the biggest risk that we we put<br>everything into the current response and<br>forget the much crisi<br>much bigger crisis that might that might<br>come<br>so so what does it mean for tourism and<br>where is tourism made<br>um i think it's probably fair to say<br>that tourism has a mixed<br>track record that is in fact globally uh<br>no different from new zealand so there's<br>always some islands of excellence some<br>businesses that really go the extra mile<br>that innovate that come up with amazing<br>initiatives<br>um but by and large the sector is<br>probably lagging behind many other<br>sectors in terms<br>of a decarbonization framework<br>in terms of a reduction pathway with<br>targets<br>in terms of individual monitoring and<br>reporting<br>and investment in low carbon innovation<br>and that could be technology innovation<br>or it could also be service delivery<br>um i think i come to my first slide i'm<br>christian<br>um this has been a long introduction and<br>but i only have two slides so<br>so just just i do want to show this<br>because one of the biggest problems of<br>tourism<br>in addition to that we haven't actually<br>i mean collectively as a global industry<br>haven't<br>exactly prioritized um climate action<br>but one of the<br>the issues is of course the growth up<br>until carved<br>tourism has seen above average economic<br>growth<br>almost everywhere and certainly in new<br>zealand the circles you can see here<br>are the carbon emissions by country of<br>origin in 2009<br>compared with 2019 and that is just for<br>air travel<br>and so no matter what we do just because<br>of that golf and you can see in<br>particular asia<br>that the the burden or the liability of<br>um tourism um<br>for carbon is is tremendous and you can<br>also see why for example governments in<br>some ways are not so keen to include<br>this into our national carbon accounts<br>um but you can also see that if we did<br>um we would have some incentive to<br>address this so so<br>that's the graph on the next slide<br>christian<br>i i built on um some work from the<br>parliamentary commissioner for the<br>environment's first report um where he<br>presented some<br>carbon footprint slightly different<br>methodology to what statistics new<br>zealand are providing<br>but essentially the same story so here<br>you can see that<br>much of the carbon footprint comes from<br>air travel international<br>but also domestic and that is followed<br>by<br>other forms of transport and then<br>interestingly the whole<br>food beverage sector supply chains come<br>in for<br>for import and then things like<br>accommodation shopping so what i tried<br>to do here<br>in the book and again i give you another<br>plucky<br>sierra if someone wants to study this<br>day it's it's all in the book but<br>um there's obviously some<br>in some ways loud hanging food what we<br>can do for all of these segments of the<br>pie i guess to make them smaller<br>um and and i i won't go too much into<br>detail but the big one<br>is really uh to to address aviation<br>fuels<br>and that will only happen with<br>government support the countries where<br>some movement is happening for example<br>norway and the netherlands<br>involve a partnership between the the<br>airline<br>and the government and that's for core<br>for pilot plants for example for<br>synthetic fuel and that's<br>blend and mandates to to ramp up<br>non-fossil fuel<br>as part of of um of our oil fuel<br>um i think that's as far as i go on this<br>slide but i do want to and because i am<br>viewing a department of conservation<br>head as well so<br>allow me one minute uh to say what are<br>we doing um<br>because obviously a doc is a key<br>provider<br>or component of the new zealand tourism<br>system<br>um and as part of the government we also<br>have carbon reduction targets in place<br>and we now have not only a climate<br>change adaptation action plan but<br>a sustainability strategy which is about<br>to<br>be signed off and and that for example<br>stipulates that we have to reduce our<br>emissions by<br>3.3 percent every year um<br>and 37 percent by 2030<br>that's actually not an easy undertaking<br>um<br>some of the work that doc relies on is<br>quite carbon intensive um<br>for example four wheel drives and<br>helicopters but we certainly address our<br>air travel staff air travel<br>we have electric vehicle fleet rollout<br>and quite a few other initiatives the<br>principles<br>are measured to manage so we're going<br>for an intensive carbon audit<br>innovation so for example using drones<br>for monitoring instead of helicopters<br>working with others<br>and that's a wide range of partners for<br>example around<br>restoration and offsetting and<br>regulatory<br>processes are working with<br>concessionaires for example<br>so um certainly we recognize the need to<br>contribute<br>um and i hope that regardless so i've<br>come full circle now with the taskforce<br>report regardless of that<br>i do think we need a decarbonization<br>strategy for tourism in new zealand<br>that enables that transformation so<br>thank you very much susana um<br>and over to you now dave bamford<br>tenacio kennecotto tenacotto<br>what a privilege to be here today<br>amongst this<br>academic lineup and thank you kristen<br>and the team at victoria university for<br>having<br>me involved i reflect that 50 years ago<br>i was a struggling third year student<br>at university and here i am today with<br>an academic panel that some of my<br>friends are joking with me about<br>however i did get actively involved last<br>year in<br>really being enthusiastic about a reset<br>the opportunity to give our land a break<br>after all the pressures and and the<br>impacts<br>however a year ago when we were<br>discussing<br>the idea of a reset some of us<br>spent a lot of time during lockdown<br>discussing these issues<br>and my thoughts at that stage and i<br>cringe when i look back i thought three<br>things<br>one is we're going to have a bubble open<br>by<br>september october last year two we<br>wouldn't have a bounce back from the<br>domestic tourism and three we wouldn't<br>see a vaccination for another couple of<br>years so<br>how wrong were some of us however<br>our national parks or sorry next slide<br>please<br>christian our national parks<br>were still have been under a lot of<br>pressure<br>predominantly from environmental noise<br>social and cultural<br>and we were struggling with it and<br>the good example was the tongariro<br>alpine crossing it was supposed<br>to boy of what was wrong with our<br>i put the slide in for our international<br>visitors just to<br>show how important our national parks<br>and conservation areas<br>so our parks were busy a million people<br>to milford<br>a million to the glaciers and i looked<br>back<br>when i worked there 40 years ago we had<br>a hundred thousand visitors in a year<br>so considerable change from a time when<br>i was a<br>a serious advocate for visitors to our<br>national parks the balance of<br>use and protection so we now have<br>a millionaire sorry we had a million<br>visitors to<br>oraki mount cook and lots of pressures<br>boats planes buses we've knit our<br>country our national parks has the most<br>permissive<br>regulations about helicopters and<br>aircraft<br>in the national parks around the world<br>so we had got to a stage that we were<br>being a bit of a free-for-all is<br>probably too harsh<br>but we had a very permissive approach to<br>tourism in our protected areas<br>and here was i a person who really<br>believes<br>in loving our national parks and<br>enjoying them<br>feeling the pressure environmentally<br>socially culturally and<br>not so much economically but when you<br>look at<br>the new zealand's appetite for tourism<br>prior to covert we got to about 49<br>of the community saying we are unhappy<br>about<br>so let's be pragmatic and focus on<br>solutions<br>i'm very keen that the government<br>limit the numbers to specific sites<br>and there's probably half a dozen that<br>could be<br>easily limited and i use milford as<br>example<br>the tongariro crossing as example the<br>hook of valiant<br>oraki mount cook the glaciers possibly<br>cape rajanga<br>and let's be pragmatic about it only<br>choose<br>really busy places that are having lots<br>of<br>negative impacts and manage<br>those the argument that i've heard<br>so often in the last decade<br>is we have freedom of access<br>and federation mountain clubs have been<br>very strong on this we<br>want to keep that in place i think the<br>impacts on the land are more important<br>than the freedom<br>of us to wander at will so to speak so<br>let's<br>change the legislation take the national<br>park out<br>take the conservation act and allow<br>the legislation to allow proactive<br>management<br>i think i'm less concerned about the<br>numbers<br>i'm more concerned about the impact so<br>let's<br>manage our protected areas<br>third point don't be scared to charge<br>entrance<br>entry fees to manageable sites it just<br>doesn't make sense to me if we have<br>limited financial resources to doc<br>and the communities let's use<br>the visitors to help contribute now<br>there's all sorts of different ways to<br>do that you can have a domestic rate you<br>can have an international rate<br>and so forth but our international<br>visitors<br>are as a general rule very used to<br>paying an entry fee to our protected<br>areas<br>and so we come to the international<br>visitor levy that was introduced<br>ironically<br>just before covert last covert<br>arrived last year and 35<br>international visitor levy set up<br>specifically<br>to make contributions to conservation<br>and importantly to the small villages<br>supporting<br>national parks and conservation areas<br>my heart bleeds for little places like<br>haast<br>ragland<br>france joseph where i live for a long<br>time and seeing the struggle that the<br>ratepayers have<br>to support infrastructure next slide<br>please<br>so let's be proactive about our national<br>park management plans<br>19 sorry 9 out of 13 of the national<br>park<br>management plans are completely out of<br>date<br>they're at their 10-year<br>expiratory time and i think now is the<br>time to take<br>the parliamentary commission of the<br>environment's tourism report<br>and our tourism task force report and<br>embed some of those values into<br>management plans and also destination<br>management plans around the country<br>and the three four big values i think we<br>should be worrying about that come out<br>of<br>the task force report is<br>the economic values social values<br>cultural values and environmental ones<br>so we've got a long way to go and when i<br>look back on the<br>new zealand's regional tourism plans<br>now called destination management plans<br>we used to focus very much on economic<br>benefits<br>rather than community benefits what does<br>the community want<br>from and for tourism what are the<br>cultural<br>impacts and what are the environmental<br>impacts<br>and in the yes i i traverse a lot of<br>these issues over 6 000 words<br>i've long been strong on the idea that<br>concession<br>ears are potentially huge<br>conservation partners i don't believe<br>that being a concessionaire<br>is a privilege sorry i don't believe<br>it's a right it's<br>it's a privilege and we have 1400<br>concessionaires about<br>tourism ones and i see great<br>opportunities for those<br>operators to make contributions<br>and there are some great examples in new<br>zealand<br>real journeys in fiordland company<br>island nature lodge<br>curacao canopy tours in rotorua<br>the white heron colony tours and others<br>and they are<br>focusing on ensuring that there are<br>cultural values are respected<br>conservation gains come out of it<br>the community get jobs out of it and<br>obviously the developers make some money<br>but as a general comment and i'm i have<br>been a cons<br>i am a concessionaire and i have been<br>several times over<br>oh 30 years um<br>i'm involved with the timber trail lodge<br>and we have been told very<br>this is in periora forest very clearly<br>by our shareholders<br>we want you to place your environmental<br>footprint as more important as the<br>financial dividends and a good example<br>was earlier on we were queried why do we<br>have a diesel generator<br>why are we using two thousand dollars<br>worth of diesel a month<br>get solar panels and we did we saved a<br>couple of thousand dollars<br>a month but we certainly lessened our<br>carbon emissions in on the docker state<br>kia ora dave um could you just start<br>wrapping up please for me<br>i am thank you um<br>next slide please so align concession<br>with the tourism industry itro<br>sustainability commitments and<br>and i use the example of concessionaires<br>should be showing doc clearly<br>their efforts to reduce and minimize<br>waste<br>reduce carbon emissions etc be aligned<br>with respecting manufa particularly<br>specific cultural sites so that that is<br>really my plea from the heart<br>and it's really good to have doc sitting<br>on board today<br>but i make a plea for you all keep up<br>the pressure on your politicians<br>and your elected<br>representatives at local levels and<br>national levels so<br>thank you dave um and thank you to all<br>three speakers<br>um we've gone ever so slightly over time<br>but i reckon we can still squeeze in<br>about<br>six or seven minutes worth of questions<br>uh if there's anybody out there in the<br>ether who would like to post<br>a question now please do so<br>but i think what i would like to do is<br>start with the question from<br>lee slater name sounds very familiar<br>um let's see who wants to answer this<br>one<br>considering the cool reception of both<br>the parliamentary commissioner for the<br>environments report<br>and the tourism futures task force<br>report how do we affect<br>change as tourism professionals<br>and as concerned citizens how do we<br>politicize these issues<br>when it seems that the government isn't<br>listening um<br>or if they are listening they're not<br>listening to us<br>uh who would like to answer that i'm<br>yes look i'm happy to make an initial<br>comment um<br>thanks sarah one of the things<br>that was implicit in what i said but is<br>certainly<br>very very strong in the tourism futures<br>task force<br>is to see tourism as a community<br>industry<br>and so to do that you ask a basic<br>question<br>is tourism for us or are we for tourism<br>so embedded in all those reports is<br>much greater community consultation and<br>when you look at that destination<br>management<br>mandate that is really being driven<br>through territorial local authorities<br>so i think that is the first place where<br>you start you as<br>david said you you you participate in<br>long-term<br>um long-term planning strategies you<br>make your voice heard<br>uh it's always safer in numbers doing<br>sort of collective actions about those<br>sorts of things<br>and say well you know this is the sort<br>of tourism we want or<br>enough is enough but i think sitting<br>back and being silent<br>uh has got us nowhere to the present so<br>almost anywhere you can make a voice<br>thank you dave has anybody else got<br>anything they want to add to that or<br>you have to unuse if you could unmute<br>dave bamford thank you<br>i'm fortunate to be involved with the<br>rotorua destination management planning<br>process led by<br>um stevie chadwick as mayor<br>and i'm sensing that there is a ground<br>spoil around the regions of<br>new zealand about when people are<br>working at a destination planning level<br>you've got to go and listen to the<br>community<br>and we've been given clear stares from<br>the mayor<br>you go and give everybody a good<br>listening and<br>make sure that their voices are<br>reflected back<br>in the destination management plan and<br>so i'm in<br>i'm uh really pleased<br>that around the country they are leading<br>this movement is being led and supported<br>by people like mb the staff and<br>mb are helping regions<br>be more engaged in their planning<br>approach<br>with listening to their communities we<br>are in partnership with tiarawa<br>in rotorua we're told very clearly<br>walk and step with them with your plan<br>so<br>nami<br>thank you dave i'd like to move on to a<br>question<br>for you susanna and it's from ray salter<br>and ray's asking um why<br>in new zealand has not progressed its<br>work on<br>biofuels but i would like to just extend<br>that question out<br>um i meet a lot of people who tell me<br>that what's going to save us all is the<br>fact that we're going to be flying in<br>e-planes can you just summarize for us<br>why there's no silver bullet when it<br>comes particularly to long-haul aviation<br>fuel yeah and thank you ray for the<br>question so<br>so just quickly on the 2009 um i mean<br>back then there was actually a bit of a<br>burst in activity also with other<br>airlines but it's quite different than<br>it was really about piloting and it was<br>maybe a sexy thing to try<br>to travel and make sure it works but<br>where we have moved now is actually<br>large scale production<br>so this is way beyond trialing it's<br>about truly replacing so that<br>makes it much more complicated in terms<br>of feedstocks and volumes and like i<br>said it really then requires the<br>government<br>um to support that and investment and<br>and new zealand is working on that um<br>what has also transpired now is that<br>biofuel is actually<br>um not necessarily a sustainable<br>option um there's very few um feedstocks<br>that maybe at<br>um result in a net benefit um<br>it's moved a little bit to landfill<br>waste um<br>and that's tries in the uk again<br>landfill waste is something<br>that we actually want to run down to<br>zero zero waste so it's not a feedstock<br>forever<br>so the sierra the future i see is um<br>synthetic fuels for longhorn and<br>electric<br>or maybe hybrid hydrogen electric for<br>shortfall and the time spin<br>is probably within the next 15 to 20<br>years<br>for that to happen but it requires<br>investment and it will probably<br>especially for the long haul<br>at the current technology the price is<br>about three to four times as much<br>and you can all you know figure out what<br>that means for demand<br>thank you very much susanna i actually i<br>think we've got time to squeak one more<br>question and and it's a goodie and it's<br>from<br>ian yeoman uh let's talk about the<br>levies<br>um the parliamentary commissioner um<br>suggested a departure tax we've got an<br>iavl which of course is sort of not much<br>money in the pot without the visitors<br>coming<br>to what extent can we use levies to<br>manage our sustainability or to affect<br>our sustainability<br>if someone would like to speak to that<br>please<br>maybe i start since nobody else wants to<br>say something i do think that i mean the<br>ivl<br>is a good vehicle and it does exist and<br>and there are obviously<br>discussions on okay how do we use it and<br>what will it look like<br>so once jersey picks up again and from<br>what i understand<br>the minister said um he's looking into<br>local levies and again that's then up to<br>the council to use them for<br>whether it's infrastructure or<br>sustainability measure so i do think<br>there's actually a bit of movement in<br>that space<br>has anybody got anything else i'd like<br>okay thank you very much for that well<br>we're pretty much out of time<br>um i thank you all very much for uh<br>participating um in terms of the<br>questions we have several good questions<br>unanswered my understanding is that we<br>have a facility to<br>answer those after the webinar has come<br>to a close and i'm sure it will be<br>obvious where you can get those answers<br>christian you might want to clarify that<br>and i'd like to hand back over to you<br>thank you very much and thank you very<br>much to<br>to all the speakers firstly i need to<br>apologize<br>my computer often has jumping screen<br>syndrome where<br>things pop up on the screen that i'm<br>sharing that shouldn't be there<br>and vice versa but hopefully it came<br>across<br>um well in the end so thank you very<br>much these are very<br>important discussions and what i find<br>really encouraging is that these con<br>these conversations are happening in<br>every corner of new zealand at the<br>moment that's what it feels like whether<br>you're in the north island or south<br>island<br>whether you're in political circles<br>academic cycles or
