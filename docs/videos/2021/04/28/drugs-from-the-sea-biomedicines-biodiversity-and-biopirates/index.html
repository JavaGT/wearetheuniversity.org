The lead compound for clinical trials was produced from the ‘wild’, a deep reef offshore from Kaikoura, and through aquaculture. Marine derived drug leads work! So why are there not more? The issues are ownership of the genetic material, competition with synthetic drug leads, the complexity of the natural molecules, and their supply. Now there is a further and prevailing issue - that of the loss of the very species that produce these invaluable leads. All but the latter issue are quickly resolvable, but loss of biodiversity means loss of chemical and genetic leads that will be of inordinate value to us, and future generations.<br><br>Professor Chris Battershill holds the inaugural Bay of Plenty Regional Council Chair in Coastal Science, based in Tauranga. Amongst other national and international collaborations, the new Chair oversees the New Zealand operation of the INTERCOAST programme, established by the University of Waikato and Bremen University in Germany to create a major centre of marine research excellence in the Bay of Plenty. Professor Battershill also heads the Coastal Marine Group in the School of Science and is the inaugural Director of the Coastal Marine Field Station in Tauranga. Formerly Principal Scientist and Research Team Leader (Supporting Sustainable Use of Marine Biodiversity) at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and a Programme Leader at NIWA, his research spans the tropics to the Antarctic and focuses on marine ecology, environmental science, and biodiscovery for medicinal and agricultural sectors.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thank you all right right we're underway<br>and indeed this talk is pretty much like<br>uh the biodiscovery effort for drugs<br>from the sea it started off<br>pretty slowly uh but it gathered a lot<br>of pace in the 90s<br>and then it's dropped off again up until<br>about now so this is a very timely talk<br>because there's a resurgence of interest<br>in looking for new um medicinal leads<br>particularly for things like covert<br>from the sea uh before i start uh just i<br>just wanted to acknowledge a few really<br>very important people<br>important to me because these people<br>helped me along my<br>my pathway but they're also famous in<br>their own rights internationally<br>the late day in professor pat berquist<br>she she was my supervisor through<br>both or both of my degrees at auckland<br>university<br>she's internationally renowned for her<br>work on sponges and you'll<br>you'll soon come out of this talk uh<br>just loving sponges i can guarantee it<br>and you'll all want to sign up for our<br>courses and in sponge ecology and<br>chemical ecology but pat<br>really brought that to life at an<br>international level and she was probably<br>the<br>the leader in this country along with<br>the chemist's colleagues murray monroe<br>and john blunt from the university of<br>canterbury con cambia or<br>university of auckland who really put<br>airtel new zealand at the forefront<br>of drug discovery programs from uh in<br>around the world and you'll see why that<br>is<br>the late professor joe baker he was my<br>boss for a<br>while and certainly a mentor of mine<br>through my australian years<br>he was one of the first marine natural<br>products chemists<br>ever he made himself famous by<br>discovering tyrion blue<br>and that's the the pigment that dies<br>roman cloaks<br>it's been known for a very very long<br>period of time<br>but jo was the one who actually worked<br>out the structure of the molecule and<br>its<br>synthesis professor mary garson she was<br>my mentor she was my supervisor through<br>my post-doc years particularly in<br>australia<br>she's a chemist of international repute<br>as you can see<br>and is now still working in marine<br>natural products chemistry at the<br>university of queensland<br>and dr peter murphy he ran the<br>australian program while we were running<br>the new zealand program<br>um for the new zealand australian<br>national cancer institute drug discovery<br>effort in marine systems from 1986 to<br>1996.<br>also like to note um shirley pomponi she<br>was director of harbour branch<br>oceanographic we interacted with them in<br>the u.s<br>and in those days they were funded by<br>johnson johnson<br>so you see there was this link going<br>back many many years in the marine<br>space from drug companies into the<br>marine area marine research area<br>these are our partnerships these exist<br>still to this day<br>internationally we are very well linked<br>we have partners<br>in pharmacy this is a european<br>consortium<br>the national cancer institute we're very<br>closely aligned with them in the us and<br>the scripps institution<br>of oceanography and lawyer<br>and the three on the right there are<br>relationships we have<br>to china so the very top one is jian<br>thai which is the sister city<br>to the city and the institute of coastal<br>zone research has a very strong drug<br>discovery program<br>and sim stands for the shanghai<br>institute of materia medica so there are<br>quite strong links<br>through to china as well which we tend<br>to use soon<br>so as i launch into the talk proper<br>here's something for you to think about<br>as we go on and there are bits and<br>pieces of clues<br>to resolve this conundrum there's a<br>linkage<br>uh between a sponge a crab<br>and a cancer drug discovery particularly<br>that<br>compound down there called halitin so<br>i'll resolve this for you at the end but<br>just have a think about how<br>these things might be connected it's all<br>to do with chemical ecology<br>and what i'm particularly interested in<br>that is the role of these<br>these sort of interesting compounds from<br>the organisms that<br>deliver them in nature so i'm not sure<br>if um many of you<br>have seen this movie hands up who'd seen<br>this movie<br>medicine man we'll try and run a little<br>bit of it<br>it's it's um i'd show this now because<br>part of the story is about biopiracy<br>and there's some quite prophetic<br>elements<br>in this movie that was based on land of<br>course<br>that can be mapped into the sea and all<br>of the elements of research are in it<br>there's partnership problems of course<br>what they expect when<br>a chat goes out into the jungle all the<br>time there's been this uh<br>search for cancer and then of course uh<br>where does the research funding come<br>from<br>so it's all in there and we'll see if we<br>can play a little bit of it<br>i think for those who haven't seen it<br>oh there we go it's not going to play<br>and hopefully the sound will come<br>through i play this because it does tend<br>to<br>um give um a bit of a<br>perspective of what happened in the<br>biopiracy days<br>robert campbell has gone deep into the<br>amazon rainforest<br>into a world of astonishing beauty<br>a land of ancient mystery<br>where he's made an amazing discovery<br>what is it you think you've got i don't<br>think<br>i know you found the cure for cancer and<br>all you can say<br>is i know there's just one problem you<br>did what<br>i've lost haven't you ever lost anything<br>to pass your car keys<br>well it's rather like that now you have<br>it now you don't a miracle without proof<br>is only a miracle<br>now they must rediscover that miracle<br>well i'll leave it there but um there's<br>a few things from that uh that you might<br>note<br>they went into a rain forest<br>an area of very high biodiversity there<br>are issues of provenance of course um<br>they're because there's a question about<br>their interaction with the local<br>communities there<br>oh<br>let me talk to you about another matter<br>here we go<br>okay and um you might have noticed some<br>of the technology he had which was<br>enormously well advanced for 1992<br>because it's only just recently we've<br>got<br>desktop hplcs and mass specs and things<br>like that<br>with the dot matrix printouts but it was<br>it's an interesting story and you'll see<br>elements<br>um in the talk that will come from that<br>movie and that is going out into areas<br>of high biodiversity<br>having a look for leads for biomedicines<br>and then trying to do something with it<br>and there's all sorts of issues in<br>around that<br>in terms of who owns the ip what do you<br>do with that biodiversity as you collect<br>it<br>the story is about actually losing the<br>original source<br>and it's all around trying to come up<br>with novel medicines that are going to<br>be<br>needed in a planet that is now<br>overpopulated<br>and where we're seeing things like<br>covert 19 come up more prevalently<br>so in the past that search through<br>nature<br>through natural biodiversity was called<br>bioprospecting<br>but that of course invoked this idea<br>that you went out and then mined<br>the resource and indeed there are many<br>cases particularly in rainforests and<br>elsewhere where they did in fact<br>mine some quite rare resources plants<br>fungi<br>and the likes uh almost to the point<br>where they were lost<br>uh we have coined the this term by<br>discovery because<br>it suggests that we're not going to go<br>and mine the natural resource that's out<br>there<br>rather we're going to come up with other<br>ways of producing<br>either mimics of the molecules or coming<br>up with other ways of<br>producing them so the talk's all around<br>pharmaceuticals but there's all sorts of<br>other<br>bioactive leads of use to humankind that<br>we can develop from<br>from this discovery program and i'll<br>give you some examples of what they look<br>like<br>of relevance to this country at the end<br>so useful by medicinals if you like from<br>nature<br>you will know these already aspirin<br>from the bark of willow trees digitalis<br>you can kill people with it of course<br>but there is a<br>drug that's used for cardiac issues<br>and so there's this natural progression<br>of going to the land looking at plants<br>in particular<br>for medicinal outcomes um this isn't new<br>uh chimpanzees have been by discoverers<br>well well before<br>we have and uh it took um a little while<br>for people to realize<br>that uh where chimps were around if you<br>watch them often enough<br>particularly when they're sick they went<br>to certain plants and then ate those if<br>they had<br>a profusion of of parasites for instance<br>in the gut they'd go to a particular<br>plant and eat it<br>and so this idea of looking to nature<br>for some clues came out<br>and the researchers have since with the<br>indigenous folks of the areas which is a<br>good thing<br>uh have then sped up their discovery<br>programs<br>and looking for drug leads from nature<br>so that's what we were doing in the sea<br>so the program that we're involved in<br>from the the<br>like mid 80s right through to probably<br>the early 2000s<br>was taking this sort of this discovery<br>pattern on land back underwater so our<br>role in that<br>as part of a very large team uh was to<br>look at<br>by discovery in this country there was a<br>parallel program in australia that i<br>went and<br>was fortunate enough to be engaged with<br>to create marine biodiversity libraries<br>of course the minute we went into the<br>sea we found<br>lots and lots of new species indeed<br>that's happening today<br>just in diving out in the harbour here<br>just over the last<br>year a student of ours has discovered<br>two brand new species of sponge you<br>wouldn't you would be<br>surprised new to nature and here's just<br>uh recently published on those so when<br>you look you find new things<br>and they are full of interesting<br>compounds so as i said they have<br>medicinal outcomes but all sorts of<br>other outcomes as well<br>if we look to the current sources of<br>modern drugs<br>we can see that about half of them are<br>directly derived from<br>natural products so this this is from<br>nature<br>that yellow piece of the pie chart are<br>the synthetics so these are synthetics<br>but they're analogues<br>of discoveries made from nature so most<br>of the leads<br>that we have for our drug therapies have<br>come from nature in some form or other<br>that little core there the blue core<br>represents the leads that have been<br>successfully developed from just<br>pure chemistry they call that<br>combinatorial chemistry so that's where<br>the medicinal lead has been invented by<br>chemists<br>based on what they understand of other<br>chemistry that seems to work<br>it's very small and they haven't had any<br>major discoveries in that space for many<br>years despite<br>expending quite a bit of money so we<br>look to nature and we can find the leads<br>and the<br>and the reason for that is that with<br>diversity<br>in nature you have a lot of diversity in<br>the chemistry<br>and you have a systems that are going on<br>where there's a lot of chemical<br>interactions<br>uh particularly amongst the animals that<br>we all share<br>very similar metabolic pathways and so<br>the chemistry that works<br>in other animals will potentially work<br>on us<br>as well so you get a much higher chance<br>even from random<br>survey programs of finding something of<br>interest<br>if we look at this diagram don't worry<br>about the small print<br>the stuff along the bottom the print<br>along the bottom of that graph<br>are the various phyla animal phyla in<br>the animal kingdom<br>and the categories moving into the three<br>dimensions there<br>are the different uh i guess ecosystems<br>on the planet including tropical<br>rainforests<br>and you can see that the bars all those<br>red bars<br>that refers to the file on the planet<br>that come from the sea<br>okay on the sea bed so almost every<br>single phylogenetic area is populated by<br>organisms<br>from the marine sea floor much more so<br>than you can see from even<br>rainforests although the insects tend to<br>predominate there<br>so from the sea 90 of the known phyla<br>are represented<br>and therefore that equates to a really<br>high<br>um a diversity of chemist chemicals<br>bioactive chemicals as you'll see<br>so this is a representation of a<br>cell metabolic pathway and each one of<br>these<br>purple names refers to a lead<br>from a marine source that will interfere<br>with that cell<br>if it's uh not functioning properly now<br>the importance of this<br>is that there are leads for interfering<br>with cell metabolic process at every<br>single stage around that cell cycle<br>and usually these types of compounds<br>interact with<br>cells that are behaving badly and of<br>course what are tumor cells they are<br>those sorts of cells they behave<br>abnormally<br>and these compounds are special in the<br>fact that they can actually<br>interact specifically at those sites so<br>there's a lot of diversity of choice<br>when you're looking for a therapeutic to<br>decide on where you really want it to<br>upset cell cycle so that cell can be<br>identified<br>and will be killed by natural immune<br>systems<br>another way of looking at why marine<br>leads do exceptionally well<br>particularly in cancer therapies is by<br>having a look at<br>this representation of a screening<br>portfolio so<br>what we did with our relationship with<br>the national cancer institute<br>is submitted our samples our marine<br>samples to the national cancer<br>institute's 60 human<br>tumor cell line okay so it's a<br>pre-clinical test<br>they have cell lines of human tumor<br>cells<br>60 of them and they're categorized into<br>various groups<br>leukemia lung colonial cancer central<br>nervous system<br>male melanoma the two outside<br>bars there the bapholomycins and you can<br>see by melanoma they have<br>peaks on the right hand side of the line<br>there<br>that's showing that they're active in<br>that area if you had peaks on the<br>right-hand side of those lines<br>for everything you might think well<br>that's really active but it's probably<br>too active you've probably got a really<br>grossly<br>cytotoxic compound so in a drug<br>discovery program<br>what they are looking for what the<br>medicinal chemists are looking for<br>is activity in just one therapeutic area<br>of interest because that demonstrates a<br>particular<br>sensitivity if you like or specificity<br>of targeted action<br>and that's what a lot of these marine<br>compounds do so we have salicylimide a<br>and lobotomize a inside the red square<br>there<br>one's from a sponge one's from a soft<br>coral both from western australia in<br>this case<br>and you can see that they have these<br>sort of peaks in the melanoma area and<br>indeed that's what those two compounds<br>are being developed for<br>so not only do they interact with tumor<br>cells but they interact quite<br>specifically and they're quite selective<br>which is a good thing<br>that's what you want this is just a<br>slide that shows<br>how well these can work<br>this is john dallas it comes from<br>sea squirt which happens to be an<br>invasive species<br>we've got a closely related species here<br>in the harbour to this it looks very<br>similar<br>that's the molecule and that's<br>significant probably in this<br>presentation also which i'll touch on<br>towards the end<br>these are big molecules amazing things<br>how that c-square can synthesize make<br>that molecule is not well known but they<br>do<br>and we'll talk about that a little bit<br>but you can sort of see the problem of<br>course and being able to produce it<br>artificially<br>anyway the actin acid-in<br>or yondalis is used for soft tissue<br>carcinoma and ovarian cancer but it<br>started off its life<br>as a therapeutic and lung cancer and you<br>can see in this patient's the same<br>patient<br>you can see those white blemishes in the<br>lung area and how they've disappeared so<br>these things work<br>and they often work by targeting the the<br>tumors<br>stopping them growing and so your immune<br>system can come and mop them up<br>so the side effects a little lower you<br>get all sorts of other interesting<br>things<br>in the hunt for medicines<br>anti-inflammatories there's a lot of<br>anti-inflammatory compounds from marine<br>organisms<br>here's one that i know and love i've<br>actually tried this i went out on<br>purpose and bought my mother<br>a pot of this it's very expensive for<br>mother's day i<br>and the reason was that i wanted to try<br>it um myself which is probably<br>not a very nice thing to do to your<br>mother he said this has already been<br>opened<br>oh that's all right it's just making<br>sure it's okay anyway um<br>it works it works really well and um you<br>know you can see that the industry for<br>estee lauder's resilience is about 7<br>billion us dollars per year<br>once again that molecule even though<br>it's a lot more simpler<br>than the previous one you saw is still<br>quite hard to make to synthesize<br>it turns out that that little sea whip<br>can make it really easily<br>and that's now the subject of a and a<br>sustainable livelihood<br>for um for peoples up in pontipe and<br>some of the micronesian islands they<br>grow it they grow it like tea and then<br>snip them<br>things off and extract it so there's<br>just a little aside on other things<br>if we get back into the therapeutic area<br>particularly in the anti-tumor active<br>drug discovery programs um and we have a<br>look at what marine organisms<br>are producing are the best leads<br>uh we always come back to sponges this<br>is where i really hook you all now<br>into looking at sponges por the<br>periphera<br>and you see both for cytotoxic extracts<br>and for the anti-cancer leads so these<br>anti-cancer leaves that don't have<br>really concomitant<br>cytotoxicity the sponges do well<br>obsidians are probably the next best and<br>that's sea squirts<br>so this is what they sponges look like<br>um and one of the reasons that they<br>are so good at providing the least leads<br>is because they're so old<br>okay so sponges are the last metazone<br>that is the lowest animal<br>multicellular animal they've been around<br>for about 800 million years<br>so that's a long time uh to to be able<br>to evolve and of course they haven't<br>evolved<br>hugely they still sit on a rock and look<br>fairly boring<br>although they're usually beautifully<br>colored what they've evolved to do<br>though<br>to maintain themselves is they have<br>developed a very sophisticated chemistry<br>and that's what makes them of strong<br>interest to us<br>added to that they have managed to get<br>on<br>with uh microbes in the sea the sea is<br>full of these things bacteria and<br>viruses<br>and some of the sponges that tropical<br>one up there ropaloidis<br>all of those little round dark shapes<br>are bacteria<br>and it is full of them this one here<br>my caylee it produces a very active<br>anti-tumor lead that's currently in<br>development<br>and it has specialist cells that<br>actually garden<br>little populations of bugs of<br>microorganisms and that's you can see<br>that b<br>refers to a bacteriocyte and once again<br>all of those little dark<br>ringed features in there this is an<br>electromicrograph uh<br>bacteria so it's gardening these<br>bacteria<br>and cells around there these ones with<br>the dark<br>stained inclusions on them are called<br>spherular cells they are chemical<br>factories<br>and what we understand is happening is<br>that the sponge is gardening<br>selected microorganisms and then<br>transferring some of the compounds from<br>them<br>into its own metabolic systems in the<br>sphere of sterile cells<br>so really really tricky stuff they also<br>massive filtering machines like no other<br>so<br>if i had a scattering of sponges say on<br>the seat on the floor here<br>fill this room up with sea water they<br>would filter the entire content<br>content of the room probably in about<br>three or four hours it wouldn't take<br>long the exhale and plumes run at two<br>knots<br>their metabolism is enormous and they<br>would strip out<br>all of the ultraplankton out of the room<br>pretty much in the same time<br>so let's have a look at what they might<br>be engaging with<br>because that's part of the story as well<br>so we come down to<br>marine microbiology and and marine<br>microbiologists are interesting people<br>they like counting things i've i've<br>found out<br>the sogen's team uh worked out there are<br>38 000 microbes in one liter of seawater<br>and he wanted to find out how many<br>microbes these are bacteria primarily<br>were in the world's oceans any weekend<br>there's about 100 times<br>a billion times a billion times a<br>billion cells in the ocean<br>and the reason for the elephant there is<br>i wanted to get a feel for just how much<br>that was<br>and so we converted that into what<br>equivalent elephant weights were if you<br>filtered out all the bugs<br>out of the world's oceans an elephant<br>weighs about four tons<br>okay here we go 240 billion elephants in<br>weight<br>and i worked out for tauranga moana on a<br>full tide<br>we're probably dealing with about two to<br>four elephants and weight<br>of marine microorganisms but if there<br>was a plankton bloom uh it might be<br>double that<br>so there's there's a lot of<br>microorganisms in there in the ocean<br>not to be outdone a chap named curtis<br>suttle<br>decided he this this one works in<br>viruses<br>marine viruses and he found that one<br>mill of seawater has about 50 million<br>viruses in them<br>and so he decided to outdo shogun<br>and virtually put them end to end and<br>figured that they would go out to space<br>if you put every single virus in the<br>world's ocean to about 60 galaxies<br>okay so the sea is a biologically active<br>chemical soup and so that way we not<br>only have these lowest meta zones 800<br>million years or so<br>old interacting with their own bugs but<br>they're also constantly coming<br>into contact with things that they're<br>filtering both good and bad<br>and they need to react to that so they<br>live in this chemical soup<br>and it's from that they're able to do<br>some pretty amazing things we know<br>that already that there's lateral gene<br>transfer through a lot of these things<br>between<br>marine bacteria and other organisms so<br>they harness a lot of that chemistry<br>and they're very flexible in doing that<br>so they're not hardwired many of them<br>into just making one particular compound<br>they can actually do quite clever things<br>so these uh the drug leads from the sea<br>up until reasonably recently and i use<br>this table because it's<br>the result of the work that we did in<br>aotearoa and in australia<br>and i popped that up because i also<br>wanted to highlight the ones that we<br>have contributed to okay they're all the<br>ones in black there<br>those are the australasian leads and<br>most of them have come from<br>us from new zealand and also the<br>antarctic<br>so 30 are from australasia a really high<br>hit rate<br>given that our contribution was actually<br>relatively minor<br>in the global program okay so this is<br>the results from the globe<br>some of these things you may well know<br>um the cone shells um<br>which is called is a compound out there<br>now it's a drug prealt<br>uh it's for intractable pain and of<br>course it comes from<br>cone shell venom that was developed at<br>the university of queensland<br>so why why do we have such a high hit<br>rate<br>finding these anti-tumor active leads<br>well<br>fortunately we have a census and it's<br>ongoing<br>and i was very lucky during my time at<br>ames<br>to look after a group that was involved<br>with the coral reef<br>census of marine life so there's some<br>results from that<br>uh about 250 000 species these are<br>marine<br>animals okay marine macro organisms they<br>think there's about a million<br>but those are the ones that have been<br>formally identified so far<br>if we have a look at how we're doing<br>our eez is the fourth largest it's about<br>one percent of the earth's surface<br>if we have 250 000 more or less species<br>worldwide<br>we have about 17 000 in fact it's now 17<br>137 with the two new sponges that we<br>have just found off of toronto um<br>so 14 of the species so we've got a<br>pretty high<br>diversity and the other important thing<br>is the endemism the uniqueness<br>is very high as it is on land uh<br>our marine environment and the marine<br>plants and animals there<br>are unique to this country<br>so that means two things one is there's<br>a lot of diversity going sample<br>but what we find uh is likely not to<br>have been found elsewhere<br>and that's important when you're<br>considering the intellectual property<br>space<br>because you're coming up with new<br>compounds new species new compounds and<br>that can be very important<br>the other reason is that we were all<br>marine ecologists<br>uh in this hunt elsewhere around the<br>world and you'll see a little bit more<br>of this<br>uh the people who are looking at um drug<br>discovery programs were chemists<br>now are there any chemists in the<br>audience<br>hopefully not or what i'm about to say<br>chemists don't like variation in nature<br>i've found naughty physicists actually<br>but nature is enormously variable and so<br>the the drug<br>discovery companies weren't really<br>interested<br>in compounds that had a lot of variation<br>in them that weren't too stable<br>to us they were the really interesting<br>ones because it meant that there was a<br>lot of flexibility going on<br>and i'll get i'll give an explanation<br>that we probably<br>the the term chemical ecology has come<br>up because we<br>we want to understand why these<br>organisms produce these compounds the<br>way they do<br>and what their role in nature is and<br>most of it is when you're dealing with<br>things that need to sit on a rock to<br>live<br>is defending their real estate their<br>patch<br>occupy space and defend themselves from<br>things that want that space<br>and here's a classic example you've got<br>this little sea squirt in the middle of<br>there<br>a diadem it produces known highly<br>bioactive compounds which are<br>also initially in the cancer screening<br>program called digems<br>and you have the soft coral that really<br>wants that territory<br>but you can see that that little<br>sediment and there's another one beside<br>it too<br>and a palladium it's holding its own so<br>it's producing these compounds which<br>this was in a shallow water so there's a<br>lot of water going over that<br>so the dilution of anything it exudes is<br>huge<br>so these compounds are super potent they<br>clearly are having effect<br>because that soft coral just isn't<br>wanting to grow anymore the cells have<br>stopped growing in it<br>and if you have a look around the border<br>of the soft coral there there's no<br>death so the city is producing compound<br>that's not<br>toxic it's just not killing the cells<br>it's rather getting into those cells<br>and stopping from growing and that of<br>course is probably what you want<br>for an anti-tumor active lead you want<br>something hugely potent<br>something get ins inside a target cell<br>and then something that will just stop<br>it<br>because it's aberrant and then you can<br>have other mechanisms to clean it up<br>so that's one of the reasons why we were<br>successful because we went out to<br>places to look for these things the<br>other thing we found as i said<br>is a lot of variation one species has a<br>lots and lots of different uh<br>configurations on similar<br>molecular themes there will be a test on<br>this too by the way so<br>no note where all of those things are<br>um this one the disco abdomens<br>electroculia<br>it's found right throughout the southern<br>hemisphere<br>mainly in in colder places there's about<br>30 now<br>configurations of that particular<br>molecular<br>theme or moiety and not all of those<br>constructs are equally active so this is<br>the<br>family of helicondrens from the lead<br>that has done exceptionally well it's<br>now drug from new zealand<br>talk about that a little bit more um and<br>here are the different there are nine<br>different<br>types of helicopter and molecule and<br>most of them only vary with one atom<br>here and there so but it shifts the<br>whole sort of three-dimensional shape of<br>that atom<br>of the molecule and that then causes it<br>to interact<br>differently depending on what it's<br>applied to and you can see here<br>helicondrone b<br>which was the precursor of the drug<br>halibun<br>a late phase breast cancer active uh has<br>an enormously potent<br>um activity in the initial targets it<br>was put against which are melanoma cells<br>point zero nine nanograms per ml<br>enormously potent<br>and yet helichondron a one atom<br>difference has no activity whatsoever<br>so that's telling us that these sponges<br>or other marine organisms<br>are creating a bit of a family of<br>compounds or they have a sort of a base<br>molecule<br>that they can stick things onto by<br>harnessing some of the bacteria and<br>stuff<br>around them so they're quite clever and<br>so they can actually create molecules<br>on the seabed and all of those horrible<br>rough conditions<br>to fit to purpose and that to me is<br>really exciting<br>we wanted to check whether that was was<br>the case and we thought oh well the only<br>place to go and really have a look at<br>this theory is to go somewhere where<br>there is no change<br>at all on the seabed and where there is<br>a pristine environment<br>so we thought let's go down to the<br>antarctic we knew some of these things<br>were down there<br>flew down one of the first problems was<br>finding somewhere<br>shallow enough to dive so you start off<br>by digging a little hole<br>then you get a bigger digger and build a<br>bigger hole<br>pop down to the bottom this is a little<br>bit grainy because it was taken with one<br>of those really old nikons<br>ages ago but those white posts were<br>sediment traps because we at the same<br>time were worried about<br>some of the permafrost melt that's<br>another whole story<br>and we set up those sediment traps but<br>the reason i point that out is it's<br>crystal clear<br>really stable those sediment traps are<br>about 150 meters away<br>it's amazingly clear near the optical<br>clarity of seawater<br>but you can see that's a sponge garden<br>there's as much diversity there as in a<br>coral reef per unit area<br>it's absolutely packed and we figured<br>well it's so stable down there it's<br>always minus 1.98 or 999<br>degrees c you know there's no real<br>change we tried to dive as much as we<br>could under the permanent sea ice so<br>it's pitch black<br>but down there we also found that yes if<br>we ran experiments and triggered an<br>immune response or something in these<br>things<br>they could respond by reconfiguring<br>those molecules<br>into different configurations which were<br>active against the disturbance we're<br>putting on them<br>and the interesting thing is that they<br>are doing that at -2<br>at exactly the same rate as the same<br>experiment was done<br>up in plus 18 degrees up here<br>now the the biochemistry and the enzyme<br>activity<br>to allow that to happen is just<br>incredible because to do that<br>synthetically you need a hot acid bath<br>with all sorts of other reagents in it<br>so we have we haven't done this yet but<br>there is a lot to learn<br>on how these organisms are manipulating<br>really complex molecules into<br>a desired direction so that's uh<br>what this is all about uh some drug<br>design<br>opportunities we know we can coerce<br>these things<br>to manufacture or biosynthesize these<br>molecules<br>into a more desirable direction the next<br>thing is to see whether we can do it<br>into a direction that is more<br>appropriate for humans use<br>so it sort of begs the question though<br>why not just kill your neighbours<br>some some of us might like to do that<br>but you never know when they're going to<br>yep<br>the people who will be able to draw that<br>diagram are chemists themselves<br>yeah absolutely and that's a it's a<br>massively uh tricky job how they do it<br>is using a thing called a nuclear<br>magnetic resonance spectrophotometer<br>which holds uh a small sample<br>in an enormously powerful magnetic field<br>the one we've got 600 megahertz<br>there's one in brisbane which is 900<br>megahertz don't take your cell phone<br>or swipe card with you when you go near<br>it but they they then shake<br>the molecule and the magnetic field<br>around it<br>allows you to see i guess the stresses<br>between the various<br>uh atoms and molecules in the carbon<br>chain and from the<br>various stresses in between the<br>different molecules they can work out<br>the three-dimensional structure<br>of it so yeah no people<br>way way more clever than i do that but<br>yeah well the thing is the the ones that<br>actually design these things of course<br>are the organisms themselves<br>and for many of these molecules<br>helicopter and b the one that generated<br>the<br>uh halogen from new zealand the drug<br>halivin<br>that that has been synthesized only once<br>as a phd project and the yields were<br>infinitesimally small<br>so um and i'll get to that story in a<br>minute actually<br>on how you actually produce these these<br>complex molecules<br>but it was a good question because yeah<br>they really we have a lot to<br>to pay homage to for the um the marine<br>natural product<br>chemists who actually work out the<br>three-dimensional structure of these<br>massive molecules<br>and if you're dealing with things like<br>proteins and things as well then it's<br>even<br>even more so so yeah the reason why<br>they don't kill their neighbours is<br>because if you do that constantly you<br>might end up with a neighbor who's got<br>more weaponry than you do<br>okay so that's usually the case so<br>part of this um a term that sort of<br>springs uh from all of this in fact it<br>was a precursor<br>to it there's a lilopathy and this this<br>is um the interactions are well known um<br>in the terrestrial domain uh from<br>interactions between plants i mean<br>you often see it look into a canopy and<br>you can see the plants not sort of<br>touching one another they send their<br>chemical defenses as well exactly the<br>same<br>and in a complex marine environment<br>allelopathy is happening all the time<br>so you get different interactions from<br>the same organism depending which border<br>it's engaging<br>with in some places it's being<br>aggressive<br>things that can take over in other<br>places it's in a standoff situation so<br>the chemistry's<br>quite complex and we have a grant right<br>now from mb<br>looking at allelopathy and the chemical<br>weaponry used uh particularly when we're<br>dealing with marine invasives<br>so here's another element of chemical<br>ecology which<br>hastens our ability to really quickly<br>find neat leads<br>because of course if you're an invader a<br>marine invader be<br>a soft coral or a sea squirt or<br>something<br>and you're wanting to stick to a surface<br>which is already occupied by native<br>species<br>you need to be able to somehow switch<br>off the defensive<br>responses of that native community and<br>that's where this chemical warfare comes<br>into it<br>and that's what these marine invaders do<br>so we had a look at that list<br>that we had up there before of the leads<br>and i thought well let's interrogate<br>that list and see<br>how many of those leads are episodic<br>species so things that live on top of<br>other ones<br>species that need to switch off the<br>rebellious response<br>of the organisms that they're sitting on<br>and we found that half of them<br>are episodic species so half of them<br>need to we'll sit on<br>top of another species then we looked at<br>that half and found that 87.5<br>were invasive species so things that are<br>coming in on ship hulls<br>things that are in our harbor now these<br>are aggressive chemical warriors if you<br>like and they do well<br>i mean of all of those they all had some<br>form of immunosuppressive activity<br>so once again if you think of it from a<br>sea squirt's perspective<br>on on coming up to a wharf piling as a<br>lava or something it needs to switch off<br>the antagonistic response of things<br>that's happening<br>and that's what they do so this is<br>hopefully just giving a bit of insight<br>into<br>the cleverness of the chemistry and how<br>it's made<br>and really the sophistication of some of<br>the interactions<br>of the organisms that we have on the<br>seabed<br>i sort of hinted at this before i mean<br>the rain forests<br>of the sea um have been argued to be<br>like tropical coral reef systems<br>and this is where a lot of the world's<br>by discovery programs have gone<br>it's it's really nice and beautiful to<br>go there<br>we however found much better territory<br>to harvest<br>inside smell our ports and harbours and<br>systems<br>and dare i say near sewage outfalls<br>so we're going to the yucky places but<br>anyway we did really well in in these<br>places<br>and we found uh things like this now<br>this is this really<br>breaks my heart it's a very sick sad<br>sponge still alive hanging in there<br>um and it shouldn't look like that at<br>all but this was near a sewage out full<br>but the interesting thing is it produced<br>these very strongly the sick one is in<br>blue<br>really strongly herpes simplex and<br>poliovirus<br>antiviral compounds with no cytotoxicity<br>so it was producing compounds that were<br>getting into the cells<br>knocking out the virus but not actually<br>killing the cells now there's<br>antivirals are quite rare that's what it<br>should look like<br>that's a healthy one which was taken in<br>the same harbor this was from otago<br>harbour<br>about 500 metres away so once again it<br>just gives you an idea that um<br>when when these organisms are challenged<br>by even<br>abnormal events this in this case a<br>human-derived sewerage plan<br>they are responding to some irritation<br>some challenge<br>in in their water column very<br>specifically<br>and this once again gives us a hint as<br>to where we might be able to go into the<br>future by actually<br>using them to design and initially<br>biosynthesize the compounds<br>so there's a whole bunch of leads and<br>many of these have yet to be taken up<br>and as i said there's now a resurgent of<br>interest<br>in following up on some of these old<br>leads and one of the biggest problems<br>was how you produce them particularly at<br>the early stages now this is the<br>drug lead from from here from new<br>zealand halivin it's a late now<br>being used as a late phase breast cancer<br>therapeutic and is also now going to be<br>joined up with a number of other drugs<br>as a prophylactic for breast cancer<br>it's doing really well but um<br>how do you produce it when you really<br>have a lead<br>and it's known to be really hard to make<br>very expensive to make<br>so there's a bit of a chicken and egg<br>situation here the drug companies won't<br>want to take this forward<br>until it's proven it's worth you can't<br>prove it's worth until you have enough<br>of it to be actually take it into the<br>clinic<br>so that's why a lot of the natural<br>product leads particularly from the sea<br>don't go anywhere because they're<br>constantly competing<br>with synthetic analogues from elsewhere<br>but there's now as i say a resurgent of<br>interest because synthesis<br>the ability of chemists to actually make<br>analogues is now much much better than<br>ever it was<br>so the other part of this story is an<br>interesting one and that<br>this compound came from a very rare<br>sponge we estimated how much there was<br>on the planet<br>it's about 300 tons plus and mine's<br>about 50 tons<br>it's only ever been found where that<br>star is on the lip of the kokura canyon<br>that's kakura<br>and of course you know about the<br>earthquake um that<br>lip has broken away so that might have<br>been lost<br>and this is a story that um we're going<br>to head into now<br>and that is we're losing these leads in<br>this case it was through a natural<br>catastrophe<br>but what we're doing to the sea<br>from the land in particular is now<br>causing a loss of massive biodiversity<br>so we'll get to that just before i do um<br>this is the drug discovery process<br>um the discovery phase the preclinical<br>lead phase and then phases one two and<br>three in the clinic<br>there's a fourth phase which is the big<br>rollout it costs<br>for relevant it cost 800 million u.s to<br>get that drug on the market<br>took about 15 years and it was put on<br>the back burner for many many years<br>because they couldn't get enough<br>so to the discovery phase you only need<br>a few micrograms of<br>of the compound mix but to take it any<br>further<br>into the late phase for clinical trials<br>you need a gram<br>purified compound and for a sponge that<br>really means you need a ton<br>of sponge to generate their ground now<br>most of that's water<br>but it's a lot and you can imagine well<br>how do you produce that<br>we don't want to become buyer pirates we<br>don't want to go and we were very<br>tempted to i might add<br>because it had a huge potential but we<br>knew because of this particular lead it<br>was quite rare and you could do<br>significant damage to the onion<br>population of it if you went and tried<br>to trawl it up<br>it's quite deep that one so what are the<br>other ways of doing it<br>this is another example of the supply<br>side issues<br>um 847 kilos of more eel livers<br>will just give you 0.35 mix of<br>cyclotoxin for instance<br>so this is where the idea of biopiracy<br>came out because there were people going<br>and hunting out<br>nudibranchs you know these sea hares<br>eels to just get their livers<br>and creating molecules it was<br>unsustainable and it created quite a lot<br>of history<br>we got around it uh by going to<br>aquaculture<br>and this is where a lot of the sponges<br>were growing<br>just in aquaculture so that was the way<br>through so it was quite a significant<br>lead aquaculture has been a big<br>winner really for all of the down under<br>leeds<br>we've grown all of these for various<br>outcomes but it's dead easy it's a piece<br>of cake<br>and it demonstrated a way where you can<br>produce these things before they are<br>proven up<br>without harm to the environment because<br>we collected in a sustainable way<br>and it created that initial mass of of a<br>ton or so<br>to get one gram of extract worked really<br>well<br>there are companies now farmer ma for<br>the act in the city for the on dallas<br>that are now doing this as a regular<br>thing in the mediterranean on the<br>c-squared<br>it works really well um this is some of<br>the uh<br>colleagues at scripps and their work on<br>on bryce stanton a and dominic mendola a<br>colleague of ours he's now just retired<br>sadly<br>but he worked out that you could<br>actually supply<br>the global demand we did the same thing<br>for halibut simply from aquaculture<br>for that particular drug so just one of<br>these structures they're not very big<br>can<br>service 130 patients per year for that<br>particular<br>therapeutic it was our calculation for<br>helen b<br>for the globe's population who needed<br>that therapy was 80<br>long line farms would service the<br>globe's population<br>but that won't happen drug companies are<br>very nervous about any<br>form of natural production particularly<br>in the sea<br>they would rather go to an analog and<br>for those big molecules what they do is<br>they look for the<br>warhead of it the active bit and they<br>synthesize that because it's a bit<br>easier<br>but this led in the earlier days to<br>very bad collections 22 tonnes of briar<br>staten<br>or rather bugler the the briar zoen<br>it's a bit of fluffy stuff you see on<br>the walls were collected for briar<br>stanton a in the early days 22 tons they<br>scoured every last bit of it<br>out of a significant port of part of the<br>coastline<br>to find that none of it had any of the<br>activity at all but<br>it did cause this term to come up by<br>pirates<br>and it means where you go out and you<br>collect without permission<br>in other people's countries and other<br>people's backyards<br>and where you do damage to the<br>environment in the pursuit<br>of trying to find these drug leads so<br>there's a lot of<br>discussion and a lot of controversy<br>around biodiscovery by<br>prospecting projects uh and around the<br>world<br>uh so much indeed that the captain hook<br>awards<br>um a regular thing in the convention of<br>biological diversity<br>and you'll see the um we actually<br>feature in this particular one<br>2006 the access of evil award<br>canada australia and new zealand and<br>this uh that we got that<br>um not so much for anything to do with<br>biodiscovery but because<br>our countries were slow off the mark in<br>making<br>a fuss about terminator genes the<br>monsanto type things<br>but um because of this and the outrage<br>there are now quite significant<br>controls and directives from the<br>conventional biological diversity<br>and this a thing called the nagoya<br>protocol to<br>uh i guess provide guidelines on safe<br>and effective and sustainable<br>ways of discovering things so um as i<br>said aquaculture<br>fermentation gene expression and things<br>like that are all opportunities<br>to supply these sorts of organisms now<br>i'm just going to finish off um<br>unfortunately on a bit of a downer and<br>that is um we're losing the very<br>diversity that we<br>we're going to rely on um and we really<br>are some of you will have seen this in<br>the vira hub<br>talk um a week or so ago uh we really<br>are facing the perfect storm in the<br>marine domain<br>um from increased weather conditions<br>and that leads to catchment runoff<br>sediments in particular<br>pollutants come out ocean acidification<br>marine invasions<br>all of these things happening at the<br>same time and that's equating<br>to massive diversity loss so the waipu<br>river for instance<br>um it's losing every year um the<br>equivalent of 80 dairy farms<br>worth of topsoil that's how much is<br>going out so it's no good for the<br>farmers and certainly no<br>good for the for the marine areas around<br>it so we've already<br>lost we know large areas of marine<br>biodiversity<br>because of sediment inundation it takes<br>a millimeter or two<br>on the on the sea bed to knock out those<br>communities<br>and also we're losing their shallow<br>water communities as well so we're going<br>from situations like this with kelp<br>forests<br>uh to situations like this because it's<br>murky light doesn't get through<br>so the plants are doing so aren't doing<br>so well so we've got some programs<br>coming up to have a look at all of this<br>okay so that we we are in a race against<br>time<br>we absolutely are wanting to preserve<br>the diversity<br>that we can then sample into the future<br>for future narrations<br>look into the future there's all sorts<br>of other things we can do<br>and it's fantastic being involved in<br>drug discovery programs<br>but they will always be given the nature<br>of the cost<br>a consortium of approach involving big<br>pharma<br>but we can do things which are more<br>relevant to us<br>quite quickly and this is our concept<br>the blue degree it's invoking the smart<br>discovery<br>ability to look at other useful<br>bioactives<br>and how we can do that is because we<br>have these databases all the hard work<br>has been done we've made collections<br>around the world<br>and we can now move up and down the sort<br>of bioinformatics from<br>the organisms where they are what they<br>do<br>through to their chemistry through to<br>their modes of action<br>and then hunt out particular leads and<br>particular<br>sort of chemicals that we might be<br>interested in and here's an example<br>we we knew the that a number of marine<br>organisms<br>had uh pseudomonas activity from funnily<br>enough the human screens on the<br>pseudomonas<br>uh lung condition uh and we thought<br>when we learnt about the issue here<br>with psa and kiwifruit it's a<br>pseudomonas<br>target well yeah we know some things<br>that can<br>work there particularly for the motor<br>action that zespe were interested in<br>which was<br>this quorum sensing modifying type<br>activity where they are interested in<br>something or just<br>turn off the pathogen and so we went up<br>to them said look we think we have some<br>leads for you might be interested in the<br>novel<br>um shall we give it a go and it's just<br>based on the informatics<br>so we presented them with five targets<br>and all five came up active<br>and there's now one in particular that's<br>being pursued through two<br>on farm trials very shortly so<br>we can map over our medicinal uh work<br>into the agrochemical space and of<br>course veterinary space and things like<br>that<br>so we're in a pretty neat position i<br>think okay<br>covert does the deep holder remedy if<br>you google covert and new zealand you'll<br>come up with an increasing number of<br>links<br>um and this is a really important one<br>because uh there is<br>a compound out there called griffithson<br>that's um<br>this thing and it's already been<br>developed as a<br>hiv aids drug drug therapy but its mode<br>of action<br>is quite relevant to sars and and covert<br>19.<br>so we suspect there's going to be<br>probably a bit of interest in that so<br>there will be a kiwi connection<br>in the in our chase for effective<br>covert 19 antivirals<br>so coming back to this anyone thought<br>about how these connections<br>might hook up well there was an<br>interesting observation this is once<br>again<br>just a really simple example of if you<br>look to nature there are some answers<br>out there<br>and some of the first trawls that we<br>bought up of this sponge<br>uh we also brought up a number of these<br>camouflage crabs<br>and and they they came from different<br>trawls where the sponge wasn't but they<br>all ended up in the same<br>sorting tray and we noticed the<br>camouflage crab was very quickly getting<br>rid of bits of seaweed and other stuff<br>and it was going out to the sponge the<br>yellow slimy listed indorics<br>the source of hellevin and grabbing that<br>and chopping it up sticking it on its<br>carapace instead<br>so it could recognize some chemical cues<br>coming out of that sponge<br>that it suddenly it must have sensed ah<br>that it's got toxins and stuff in there<br>i'm going to stick that on my back<br>i'm not going to be lunch for anybody<br>and that's what it did<br>so we actually ran a whole bunch of<br>trials using camouflage crabs with<br>sponges and various things we knew were<br>active and 100 100<br>they went out and they got exactly the<br>right one so this actually short<br>circuits the drug discovery program<br>we just need the odd camouflage crap<br>anyway i'll wind up now<br>just for these last few images some of<br>you might have seen these before<br>um but to me it just epitomizes<br>everything that this talk was<br>it was about um i got sent these images<br>from shark bay<br>um many years ago of dolphins swimming<br>around with sponges<br>on their noses and you know being a true<br>um<br>scientist we came up with a bunch of<br>hypotheses because<br>the researchers over in wa uh want to<br>know what was going on<br>so here are the hypotheses it could be<br>using them as a game<br>it could be using the sponges for<br>protection because the dolphins are<br>known to go down on the bottom and<br>snuffle around and scare up little<br>fishes and things like that<br>could be getting high on them there's a<br>lot of alkaloids and interesting<br>compounds in there<br>or it could be using as as a medicine<br>and it soon transpired there's the<br>sponge a kind of diction<br>and it does have a lot of pretty<br>interesting terpenes and other molecules<br>in it<br>it turned out that the dolphins were<br>doing this were mainly pregnant females<br>and the suspicion is they're getting<br>something out of out of that particular<br>organism<br>the point i want to make here is that to<br>make these connections you need all of<br>those elements<br>in in the in the food web uh in<br>the environment together from the<br>lowliest of sponges<br>right all right the way through to the<br>top and apex predators all together<br>and so that's that's what conservation<br>biodiversity is all about<br>because our future really does rely on<br>it<br>and looking at these things it's like<br>the chimps when they get sick<br>going to a particular plant uh we can<br>start to pick up on some clues<br>and indeed look at some new therapies so<br>we're sitting in this country on an<br>amazing<br>biodiversity it's unique um this image<br>here<br>um many of you this is probably the<br>first time you'll have seen this<br>this was taken it's a bit grainy it was<br>just taken um<br>from a little gopro type camera it's at<br>50 meters<br>and it shows you a pretty amazing sponge<br>garden just off my tt island<br>okay but you'll notice that things down<br>the bottom there there's really nothing<br>so because it's covered in sediments<br>so these are the refugia now there's a<br>whole bunch of new species in here<br>and these organ pipes sponges and things<br>you don't normally see<br>south of the poor knights islands so<br>we're sitting on a pretty unique spot<br>right here<br>really interesting so we can harness<br>some of the existing bioinformatics we<br>have<br>to be smarter and more accurate and<br>faster in being able to find these leads<br>we can map them into spaces elsewhere<br>that we can benefit as a country<br>economically<br>really quickly in this agrochemical<br>space but we<br>really are uh in a significant race<br>against time we really do need to<br>try and halt this uh this attrition of<br>our<br>our seascapes particularly from land<br>inundation<br>so i'll leave it there and thank you<br>very much for your time<br>chris thank you um sponges fascinating<br>who would have thought um ladies and<br>gentlemen traditionally we do finish now<br>at 7 00 pm so if you need to leave<br>please<br>uh feel free to do so uh but we'll ask<br>chris for<br>to hang around for 10 minutes or so if<br>you have questions i think i'll leave<br>the mic with chris so if you could raise<br>your hand if you have a question and i<br>point to you if you could stand<br>and project your voice i'd appreciate<br>that so questions please if you need to<br>leave feel free to do that<br>questions for chris please<br>um<br>the question was has the arena affected<br>diversity<br>in our ecosystem um no it hasn't<br>uh which has been a good thing we've<br>been monitoring the effects of the arena<br>ever since it happened<br>and this october would be 10 years<br>that that reef has covered it had an<br>initial<br>impact in the immediate zone<br>particularly where the ship hull was<br>scraping<br>the legacy of it is is probably<br>associated with a tin coming off the<br>hull<br>but the organisms have accommodated that<br>i think one thing the arena showed us is<br>just how quickly the marine environment<br>can actually um<br>uh recover and how resilient is however<br>the arena plus all sorts of other things<br>probably wouldn't<br>be a good thing and we're very fortunate<br>that the oil that<br>was released from it was picked up very<br>carefully by human hands<br>on the beaches really really quickly<br>afterwards<br>if that hadn't happened then yes indeed<br>i think we would have seen<br>a bit more of a legacy also dispersants<br>we<br>weren't used in that case and we would<br>have also seen a legacy of that because<br>i mean the exxon valdez for instance<br>that's still<br>seen quite an impact in the short life<br>and around there but around uh otaiti<br>astrolab reef<br>you can die the arena is there still i<br>mean uh two-thirds of it<br>are pretty much down quite deep but uh<br>there's there's quite significant<br>recovery in there<br>um many of the organisms will have taken<br>up some of the metals um whether they're<br>edible or not another thing you might<br>wish to ask but<br>there appears to be no longer-term<br>damage to the biodiversity out there<br>the connections with china tell me the<br>three universities there<br>what is the relationship and do you grow<br>the question is our relationship what's<br>the nature of our relationship with the<br>agencies in china um the relationship's<br>actually<br>um initially one of remediating<br>uh damaged environments and because the<br>the agencies in yantai in particular uh<br>lead the world in<br>algal research and they are charged<br>primarily<br>for looking at seaweeds that can<br>actually enhance remediation of damaged<br>environments<br>so up there the bow high sea is<br>effectively dead and<br>we are learning from them techniques to<br>create cultivars of seaweeds that do<br>good things<br>that can scrub up nutrients out of both<br>fresh and marine waters<br>and generate products that we can<br>actually use either as agri-feeds<br>some of those species for instance you<br>might have heard if you feed them to<br>cattle<br>it reduces their methane productions and<br>emissions<br>others can be used as soil amenities so<br>that's the prime<br>use however the institute of materia<br>medica<br>has a repository like ours and so we're<br>in a situation where we can share<br>knowledge about where medicinal leads<br>are or agrochemical leads or veterinary<br>leads<br>and then look for the sources of those<br>in<br>in this country which are likely to be<br>subtly different but potentially better<br>and so that's what we are doing is<br>sharing international databases<br>they are interested i think in the<br>techniques that we're evolving<br>which is sort of looking at natural<br>biosynthetic pathways<br>to enhance the ability to actually<br>yes chris you mentioned the enormous<br>filtering capacity of sponsors early in<br>your talk<br>um<br>just wait for it to go by and the second<br>half of my question<br>is there any future for using sponges<br>for<br>cleaning up the waterways that we are<br>probably<br>um yeah good question so the the the<br>sponge pumping system is called an<br>aquiferous system<br>and it's generated by um a cell called a<br>coenocyte<br>which is just a cell it has a little<br>flagellar in it<br>and these coanocytes are grouped in<br>chambers spread right throughout the<br>sort of matrix of the sponge<br>there's a pretty neat youtube clip<br>actually you can watch probably don't<br>have time to do that<br>but it takes you down inside a sponge<br>you know in three dimensions<br>effectively and then you get gobbled up<br>by an archaeo site which comes and eats<br>you because you<br>but yeah these these choanocytes just<br>beat constantly<br>that and they create a massive suction<br>power<br>with an exhaling canal as i said that<br>runs at about two knots<br>so yeah they're big pumping machines we<br>found out how efficient they were the<br>hard way though<br>rather sadly we had a ton of water with<br>a few sponges<br>in the bottom and we were transporting<br>them into an aquarium system to grow<br>this was the<br>the yellow slimy sponge to produce that<br>drug<br>and and um they all died within an hour<br>and we suddenly we had the presence of<br>mind and the next time<br>to put an oxygen probe in there and so<br>they strip the oxygen out of the water<br>column within half an hour<br>out of a ton of water and there's only<br>on a sprinkling of them<br>so their metabolism is huge they just uh<br>yeah pump like<br>like crazy can you use them in a<br>remediation situation<br>um they're probably already doing that<br>the only issue with many of these<br>these lower invertebrates is that they<br>can get smothered really easily<br>so the ones in tauranga harbour here<br>they have a mechanism that they can back<br>flush every now and then<br>and effectively wash off all the dust<br>that settles on them<br>but many species can't and so if you had<br>them in muddy water<br>that would be a problem but yeah they<br>could actually remediate um<br>other water sources as long as it wasn't<br>too much sediment<br>um it's interesting note that both at<br>the<br>entrance of tauranga main channel and<br>also up near bowentown are massive<br>sponge communities that line<br>the the reef you know it's quite deep<br>out there<br>30 40 meters or so but yeah there's just<br>sponge gardens and things and<br>they're acting as a massive filter for<br>the harbour as well we listened to a<br>talk with<br>thoughts that maybe the next antibiotics<br>would come from the sea<br>and you haven't talked about that today<br>is there anything really developing in<br>that<br>um i don't i there will be for sure but<br>i'm<br>not up to speed with the antibiotic<br>program<br>um the the tumor active ones i am i know<br>that um<br>the of that group you might have seen<br>the um acronym<br>pharmacy we were the only australasian<br>partner on that<br>that's just coming to an end it was<br>funded i think by about<br>10 million euro and they were directly<br>looking for anti-infectives antibiotics<br>they've come up with one lead<br>in all that time so they i mean you've<br>actually<br>hit the tricky territory in all of this<br>but having said that i don't think<br>anyone's applied to some of the things<br>that we<br>perhaps have had into that therapeutic<br>area and maybe we should<br>it'll be relatively simple to do so um<br>it's<br>actually we did run some experiments<br>down the antarctic<br>where we we inoculated and with the<br>fungus that we saw growing down there<br>and there was an immediate response to<br>that<br>so um yeah you got me i think we need to<br>that<br>thank you for your address tonight this<br>question is more about protection<br>of the research team's findings<br>you're meeting discord so it comes to<br>mind<br>18 months ago so very<br>shall we stay open about initiating<br>boundaries with research involving<br>chinese is a blood question but it is<br>now part of how we have to<br>absolutely relevant question and the<br>question was around ip protection<br>so we've actually from this country led<br>the world<br>in recognition of indigenous rights and<br>we're fortunate in this country to have<br>a treaty<br>it might interest you to know that you<br>can't trade in<br>any of the leads from marine or any<br>other organism<br>unless you have subscribed to the<br>principles within the conventional<br>biological diversity<br>and there are two key things and and<br>that one is<br>mutually agreed terms with traditional<br>owners<br>where they might be known and also<br>prior informed consent so those two<br>things have to be in place first<br>and then the protection can follow so<br>there should be no trade unless those<br>sorts of things<br>are invoked in australia when i first<br>went over there<br>because of the power state of indigenous<br>communities<br>aboriginal and torres strait communities<br>many of them had<br>lost knowledge of really where their<br>rocky equivalent if you like was over<br>there<br>and we initiated<br>actually it caused a bit of concern for<br>the federal government there<br>a policy where as you would in this<br>country you ask permission first before<br>you go and sample in anything<br>and you actually identify who the<br>traditional owners are that's absolutely<br>essential at the bottom step because all<br>of these other things that<br>you're suggesting in terms of biopiracy<br>of intellectual property<br>and taking it away can then be<br>safeguarded because you have<br>these international conventions to rely<br>on and the biggest one of those is this<br>thing called the nagoya protocol<br>however i think this country's signed up<br>for that yet<br>and the reason it hasn't is because of<br>the treaty segment process hasn't been<br>completed yet but<br>we aspire to those sorts of principles<br>my question relates to something which<br>was not part of your address tonight<br>but i wonder if you could just give us<br>your personal view<br>on the future of the clay barrier reef<br>yeah sure um the it's dire uh<br>to put it mildly um the the great<br>barrier for suffering from<br>uh the same sorts of situations that<br>we're the perfect storm<br>uh increasing frequency and intensity of<br>cyclonic<br>conditions land runoff of enriched<br>waterways from development of cane<br>and sugarcane and banana and<br>pineapple plantations up up and down the<br>eastern seaboard of queensland in<br>particular<br>in addition to that there's warming<br>temperatures and a rising sea level<br>and ocean acidification all happening at<br>the same time<br>so when you have acid seeds even just<br>subtle shifts<br>in the acid content of seawater corals<br>can't create skeleton anymore<br>and so they're eroded much more quickly<br>they can't grow<br>to meet these rising sea level<br>conditions with muddy waters coming out<br>of many of the rivers through the<br>australian seaboard<br>as we have here you have that turbidity<br>where it's murky they can't see and what<br>a lot of the inshore area of the<br>great barrier reef is now showing is<br>what they call a phase shift<br>where it's moved from an acropora coral<br>characterized<br>ecosystem to one now characterized by<br>seaweeds<br>so gas and seaweed so that all of that<br>diversity is lost<br>so terry hughes who runs the<br>arc center of excellence in australia<br>for looking at uh the great barrier reef<br>says<br>uh it's almost the end because the<br>prognosis<br>in terms of carbon profiles<br>in co2 is now quite bad throughout<br>australia<br>um it's there's a bit of a tauranga<br>connection here um<br>not through me but the current or he was<br>one of my bosses for a while when i was<br>at ames um<br>name is david mead he's the general<br>manager of ames and he's been put in<br>charge of a program<br>designed to try and come up with some<br>ways of ameliorating<br>some of the demise and effects of<br>climate change<br>on the great barrier reef so there are<br>people for instance who are looking at<br>more resilient<br>coral species and corals like many of<br>these sponges that we're talking about<br>also have symbionts in them that's what<br>gives them their color they're called<br>zooxanthellae<br>unicellular algae and when it gets hot<br>the coral spits them out<br>if it doesn't cool down again soon<br>enough they'll die<br>but uh madeleine van open who's heading<br>that up now she's at ames and university<br>of melbourne<br>she's looking at creating clades of<br>symbionts that are more<br>robust and hearty that they can sort of<br>translocate into corals and use them<br>inoculate reefs and use them as refugia<br>but really it's a drop in the bucket<br>uh with the issues there if that wasn't<br>enough<br>i can give you a talk on this uh there's<br>also crown of thorns starfish<br>and and they you know like a lot of<br>things that respond to bad conditions<br>um uh they will come out and plague<br>proportions<br>and there appears to be a relationship<br>with their outbreaks<br>with um area or periods of very<br>intensive rainfall<br>because the larval life history phases<br>up in the estuaries which<br>benefits them so they just come down on<br>plagues and what corals are left they<br>just come up and scour<br>so um they're creating um pretty unique<br>ways of dealing with those now<br>um they've got these underwater robots<br>that can<br>look and smell out crown of thorns and<br>then inject them with formula<br>like crown of thorns the acronyms caught<br>cot crown films and<br>they call these things a bot just<br>goes around<br>they're murdering crown of phil and<br>starfish but uh<br>yeah that's you know they're that you<br>trying to do everything they possibly<br>can<br>to look at every um i guess<br>way they might be able to just chisel<br>back a little bit of the resilience in<br>the corries but we also in this country<br>will be<br>suffering from ocean acidification as<br>well we have a lot of<br>coral species more in the deeper water<br>but anything that needs a calcium<br>carbonate skeleton<br>in the sea is going to have issues so<br>thank you ladies and gentlemen<br>on your behalf i'd like to thank uh<br>chris<br>he uh thank you chris for sharing your<br>passion<br>for our oceans for marine science and<br>for sponges your knowledge is<br>extraordinary<br>your enthusiasm is infectious and your<br>work ethic<br>is second to none you are so well<br>respected and much loved across the<br>university<br>tauranga moana and beyond ladies and<br>gentlemen professor chris
