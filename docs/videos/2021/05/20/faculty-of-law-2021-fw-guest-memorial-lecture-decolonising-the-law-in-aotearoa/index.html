lecture<br>finally it is the faculty's absolute joy<br>to welcome sir joe williams<br>many an introduction of the speaker<br>begins<br>x needs no introduction and then follows<br>a long<br>and detailed introduction i simply say<br>this<br>the honourable justice joe williams<br>judge of the new zealand supreme court<br>is one of new zealand's leading jurists<br>and leading<br>jurisprudential thinkers he will i think<br>dare us to be wise he will i expect<br>dare us to imagine law and legal<br>education<br>in 21st century rtro new zealand<br>and to explore what partnership truly<br>means<br>somebody come on<br>is<br>oh<br>oh<br>friends and colleagues please welcome<br>it was composed in the 1870s by<br>a man named tutanihoniho<br>who was infuriated by the<br>effect of the law on his interests<br>he famously stood in front of the<br>magistrates court<br>in gisborne and delivered these lines<br>ex-tempor on the spot probably composing<br>them<br>as he went now i<br>made a few tweaks to it to make it a bit<br>more relevant<br>to us but this is a good start for two<br>reasons one because<br>he talks about the extent to which the<br>law<br>is stripping him of his mana of his<br>ability<br>to manage and control his own life<br>and secondly because full of disgust<br>at the loss of his lands in gisborne he<br>picked up stakes and headed south<br>to christchurch married a naitahu woman<br>and the nihon neofano<br>are still a big whanau as far as i<br>understand it<br>seemed like a great place to start<br>because of his naitahu connection and<br>because he was really talking about<br>and then there's this guy frank guest<br>who i must say um when i was asked to<br>give this lecture<br>about five years ago um<br>i had no idea who frank guest was so<br>as you do i got one of my clerks to<br>tell me who the hell what is the guest<br>lecture am i giving a guest lecture or<br>is this guest guy<br>a person and<br>i was quite impressed by what i saw so<br>here's a guy who is a trained lawyer and<br>lecturer in philosophy<br>joins the army 1941<br>as a buck private now that seems to me<br>to be unusual<br>that he wouldn't have been offered a<br>commission he wanted to go he must have<br>wanted to go in as a private<br>and then he's imprisoned i'm not sure<br>where but looking at the<br>dates could well have been crete<br>certainly italy and<br>ends up in a pow camp stalag 14b<br>in germany and opens pow<br>university delivering lectures<br>those philistines from australia<br>i read an article of his about freedom<br>that i think many of you will know about<br>and<br>having discovered what i did about his<br>background and read that article i<br>figured i'd quite like this guy<br>as he spoke about the increasing role of<br>the state<br>in the 1950s and the problem with the<br>idea<br>particularly american and to some extent<br>he said english<br>that freedom ought to be as absolute as<br>possible<br>and property ought to be the point<br>and he argued rather well i thought and<br>in a measured way<br>that these ideas were never intended to<br>be absolute<br>and that balance is everything<br>and uh that sounds like a good tikanga<br>argument to me<br>and i think if frank guests were alive<br>and<br>the dean here at<br>otago law school without taking anything<br>away from shelley<br>and her beautiful singing<br>i think he might well have been teaching<br>a section<br>of a tikanga law course<br>so anyway here i am<br>um having been stopped from getting here<br>two three times<br>i was getting worried that that<br>the otago law school might send the team<br>up to wellington<br>to rendition me so<br>i'm really so pleased to be here and so<br>pleased to be given an opportunity to<br>talk about the subject that<br>is certainly important to me and i think<br>the way both the law and the country<br>is going to develop over the next decade<br>or more so the name of this lecture is<br>you've probably seen is decolonizing the<br>law in aotearoa can we start with the<br>law schools<br>i chose a decolonizing theme for this<br>lecture<br>and i know that decolonization was<br>coined<br>in the great reckoning that followed the<br>post-war collapse<br>of the old western european empires and<br>their replacement with the bipolar world<br>the mid 20th century<br>and that it was embraced with enthusiasm<br>by the new<br>and then optimistic united nations<br>decolonization is such a powerful word<br>it's full of implied accusation<br>and the need to atone<br>it communicates without the need for<br>more who is the good guy<br>and who is the bad guy as i hope you'll<br>see during<br>the course of this lecture i'm not<br>deploying decolonize<br>as a weapon i want to use it as a tool<br>for thinking about law<br>here in the 21st century<br>in 21st century altaru<br>and while the decolonization i have in<br>mind<br>will i hope be transformative<br>i see it as a mutually beneficial<br>process<br>i see decolonizing the law as a<br>necessary step<br>for all of us so i started with the idea<br>of<br>decolonizing the law<br>but it was quickly plain that i'd<br>skipped a step<br>law sits as you all know<br>within a wider context that's not a<br>self-contained project in its own right<br>it exists only in relation to social<br>economic political and cultural<br>realities that it purports to regulate<br>so law is an aspect of who and what we<br>are as a society<br>so decolonizing the law in altera is<br>just a part of our deeper search<br>for reconciliation and balance as a<br>community<br>that is it's part of the larger project<br>of decolonizing ourselves<br>i know that the title is<br>uh provocative but it was intended to be<br>a good starting point is what do i mean<br>by decolonizing so let's start with what<br>it is<br>uh what it isn't uh wanna jackson says<br>colonization narratives tend these days<br>to be written<br>in a stubborn past tense<br>as if colonization was a thing that<br>happened not a thing that is happening<br>properly understood colonization is a<br>process that does not<br>end in my view it didn't stop when the<br>dominion of new zealand adopted the<br>statute of westminster<br>it does continue into the present<br>traditionally decolonization meant<br>taking back your country from<br>the colonial usurpers that's how it<br>applied in africa<br>in asia and parts of the pacific not<br>here<br>this idea didn't work particularly well<br>in the settled colonies<br>such as new zealand where the indigenous<br>people swiftly became a minority<br>alongside a permanently transposed<br>settler population available<br>of decolonization and self-determination<br>which was fashionable in the second half<br>of the 20th<br>century now despite that<br>indigenous philosophers indigenous<br>minority philosophers i guess is the<br>right way to say that<br>still push quite a firm<br>line on what decolonization should mean<br>wilson and yellow bird canadian<br>academics say<br>it ultimately requires the overturning<br>of the colonial structure it's not about<br>tweaking the existing colonial system<br>to make it more indigenous friendly or a<br>little less<br>oppressive the existing system is<br>fundamentally<br>they say and irreparably flawed<br>moana jackson with whom we're much more<br>familiar though suggest that restoration<br>might be a better word than<br>decolonization<br>a way he says of restoring a kawa that<br>allows for balanced relationships<br>based on the need for ewi and hapu<br>independence<br>upon which any meaningful<br>interdependence<br>must rest actually moana's approach may<br>well be more sensible<br>but i'm stuck with my lecture title now<br>so is decolonization even possible in<br>our context<br>for countries like new zealand and our<br>cognate jurisdictions australia canada<br>and the us<br>decolonization has got to have a<br>different meaning if it's to have<br>meaning<br>at all that is if it is to mean<br>something more then let's<br>not be quite so mean to the permanent<br>indigenous minority<br>so let's talk about<br>the possibilities and the<br>non-possibilities<br>the system that operates in this country<br>as you all know<br>we're all fish swimming in the same bowl<br>value is measured in property<br>labor and skill<br>capital is the most powerful economic<br>force or factor<br>in this economy these are all<br>basic ideas that were imported into new<br>zealand<br>circa 1840 they're still here<br>and there doesn't appear to be any mood<br>at least not in mainstream discourse<br>to dislodge them that makes<br>wilson and uh is it wilson wilson and<br>yellow birds<br>comments a little difficult to deliver<br>on<br>the role of the state is to protect<br>property<br>to regulate the transactions in capital<br>labor and skill<br>that make the market system will allow<br>the market system to work<br>to help prepare its citizens for a<br>productive role<br>within the market-based economy<br>and to ameliorate the effects of<br>inequality<br>that is an inevitable result of<br>market-based<br>value transaction or if they can't be<br>ameliorated<br>if decolonizing means unpicking those<br>basic tenets<br>of the colonial system then that's not<br>going to happen anytime<br>soon alternatively if decolonization has<br>a narrow focus if it's about<br>reclaiming the right of indigenous<br>peoples to once again govern themselves<br>in their own lands<br>the jacksonian al jackson not the<br>american jackson<br>the jet or michael orr um<br>was his name robert wasn't it um<br>jacksonian approach then achieving that<br>goal will be bumpy<br>contested complex<br>multi-generational and a long term<br>sorry multi-dimensional and a long term<br>project it's really a subset<br>if it is to be achieved at all of the<br>decolonization<br>i have in mind the decolonization i have<br>in mind<br>is more subtle less spectacular<br>but meaningful nonetheless<br>they say the past is a different country<br>i'm not sure i entirely agree but<br>there's something in that idea<br>when i was born in the early 1960s as<br>the last gasp<br>of the much maligned boomers<br>i could have been forgiven for believing<br>that new zealand was located somewhere<br>off the coast<br>of the united kingdom they played god<br>save the queen at the<br>pitchers in that new zealand<br>the news readers in that new zealand<br>only spoke<br>bbc english even marama martin<br>yeah i could tell those of you who<br>and those of you who didn't laugh are<br>boomers too but you are<br>and we were kicked out of the imperial<br>nest<br>a very reluctant fledgling<br>we were the last dominion to adopt the<br>statute of westminster<br>25 years after<br>and that was just 1947 as the neo-natal<br>boomer generation began to fill<br>our publicly funded maternity wards in<br>that new zealand<br>britain was still home to the proud<br>appearance<br>of those new boomers even if they hadn't<br>they the parents had never set foot<br>on british soil over time<br>our islands seem to drift further into<br>the atlantic<br>in response to the geopolitical gravity<br>of the us<br>we weren't the only islands located<br>floating<br>there australia was also adrift<br>in the vicinity in fact australia was<br>somewhere between us<br>and the united states so colonization<br>in contemporary new zealand is i suggest<br>as much a state of mind<br>as anything else and minds can be<br>changed<br>in the end decolonization involves all<br>of us<br>making a leap of imagination<br>imagining that we are in fact a pacific<br>country<br>located at the bottom of the polynesian<br>triangle<br>realizing for the first time<br>since 1840 that we are actually<br>the dean told me that the only reason<br>she had conquered the witty<br>at the margin the signs<br>suggest to me that decolonization in the<br>sense that i'm using that term<br>is not without hope what you just saw<br>is solid evidence of that i know it's<br>token i know it's symbolic<br>but if that had happened in the new<br>zealand i grew up in<br>actually i'm serious they probably would<br>have been arrested<br>aotearoa is being re-coated<br>and renamed with polynesian story<br>and polynesian names as we speak not<br>just the whenua<br>not just the moana but the buildings the<br>agencies<br>the councils the police cars the<br>ambulances<br>the fire engines and so on<br>there are a record number of telemaori<br>classes<br>on offer in this country and you can't<br>get into one<br>and the vast majority of attendees at<br>those corn<br>some time ago maybe twenty maybe thirty<br>the famously<br>male a few words laconic kiwi bloke<br>decided to adopt the most<br>over-the-top dance on the planet<br>i just gave you a version of it earlier<br>and i don't mean you know those 1960s<br>grainy<br>when we were playing the box and the<br>lions i mean<br>really do it like if you weren't looking<br>you'd have no idea that the people doing<br>it<br>somewhere along the road<br>new zealand decided to sing the national<br>no one told them to do it no edict<br>it just happened first and i have to<br>confess i'm a rugby league nut<br>first at a rugby league test at carlow<br>park that we lost of course because it<br>then the netball then the hockey then<br>the soccer<br>of course the rugby was last but now<br>it's unimaginable<br>that we would sing the national anthem<br>without singing it in maori<br>you see i know these are symbols<br>i know that they're not substance i know<br>aotearoa continues to be full of<br>problems<br>but they are the clearest evidence that<br>aotearoa<br>is engaged in a search for itself<br>even if it doesn't know it and i suspect<br>it doesn't then there's the numbers<br>in education kohanga<br>kuda both primary and secondary<br>foreign who could have predicted 30<br>years ago that the farewall<br>sector pulls<br>as many gifts as it does i'm not sure<br>how many but it's a lot<br>that we could not now imagine a tertiary<br>education sector<br>without tribal universities<br>who could have thought that was possible<br>in 1980 when professor fata winiata<br>demographer says that the new zealand<br>sorry the maori cohort under the age of<br>25<br>is large enough to be impactful on the<br>new zealand economy<br>the question is which way and what we<br>are engaged with here<br>as shown by this simple yet really<br>important<br>gesture by the law faculty of singing to<br>you<br>in tedel and performing the actions<br>what that suggests is that we all want<br>that contribution of that under 25 maori<br>cohort<br>to be a positive way<br>not a negative way and that's going to<br>take a lot of work<br>because we carry a lot of baggage<br>in the colonization story then there's<br>politics<br>20 of maori uh 20 of mps in the house<br>are maori<br>they're only 15 or 16 we're only 15 or<br>16 of the population<br>25 of the cabinet<br>is maori the apex of settler power<br>25 is maori you add the samoans<br>and the cook islander you've got 40<br>polynesian the justice sector is<br>striking<br>there are five justice sector ministers<br>i took a lawn a samoan<br>a cook island maori and angapuhi<br>in the justice sector only one of the<br>ministers<br>is pakeha and it goes largely<br>and when you think about it what that<br>means and this is i think quite<br>important<br>quite a mind shift what that means is<br>the crown<br>isn't a pakeha it's just not<br>physically biologically the crown is not<br>white<br>and what does that mean in terms of this<br>the law follows that track<br>over the same period<br>treaty of waitangi act 1975 the creation<br>of the<br>historical settlement process in 85<br>the enactment of the children young<br>persons and their families act in 1989<br>that introduces tikanga concepts such as<br>whanau hapu and iwi<br>the resource management act in 1991 that<br>introduces<br>concepts like manafenua kaitiakitanga<br>and although it says it in english<br>relationships between<br>iwi and hapu<br>and their lands waters<br>and other taonga<br>i can't remember what the word was a<br>long time since i've looked at that act<br>and in 1993 the turf maori act the maori<br>land act is enacted<br>which effectively repatriates<br>now the maori land court and its old<br>formed the native land court<br>into tao maori and requires it to apply<br>tikanga in the administration<br>of maori land even though titles to<br>maori land<br>have been individualized since 1865 in<br>the first<br>there's a push back in the 2000s as you<br>know the retrograde step<br>of the foreshore and seabed reforms<br>and then the first significant in modern<br>terms<br>expression of maori political muscle<br>which you saw in the creation<br>of the maori party and all the russians<br>around that<br>so new zealand had a bit of a breather<br>started to feel uncomfortable with the<br>whole thing<br>in the 2000s and then from 2010 on we<br>saw the big we're in the middle of the<br>um i thought i<br>there was a second tikanga based assault<br>on the child welfare sector the olanga<br>tamariki act which introduces the idea<br>of mana tamariki<br>and not just for maori children for all<br>children<br>why i think because we're all<br>polynesians<br>introduces the idea of fanongatanga this<br>utterly central principle<br>of maori law fanongatanga the big driver<br>of maori law no hapu aniwi<br>and so forth now oranguta has its issues<br>but this legislation represents<br>a significant inculcation<br>of chicago law into one of the most<br>important<br>areas of interface between maori<br>treaty settlement driven ewe counter<br>colonization can i call it that<br>of local government is introduced<br>through changes to the local government<br>act and the resource management act<br>including through treaty settlements<br>partnership-based regulation<br>of the waikato river for goodness sake<br>the most<br>abstracted and busy fresh waterway<br>in the country and of course the in<br>internationally acclaimed statutory<br>recognition of the legal personality<br>of the whanganui river and of the urueta<br>forest these ideas that a forest<br>has personality that a river has<br>personality<br>are ancient orthodox maori ideas<br>not only are they not radical they're<br>ho-hum<br>if you listen to anyone from wanganui<br>talk about the river you'd understand<br>that that's the way they've<br>seen it forever they give you the<br>whakapapa they give you the genealogy to<br>the river<br>that's why it has personality so but<br>what's happened<br>is the centers of power<br>have begun to catch up with these ideas<br>partly not just because<br>maori want it but because they resonate<br>now with us polynesians<br>and for the most part the changes that<br>i've talked about<br>have been reflective of a bipartisan<br>consensus now if you were around in the<br>early days of the treaty settlement<br>period<br>in the 80s and 90s this would have been<br>unthinkable unthinkable<br>yet actually within a generation we've<br>moved<br>quite significantly in important areas<br>in the judicial sphere of course there<br>was the takamura case in 2013<br>the ngati fatua case in 2018<br>cases which ditch if you mind don't mind<br>me using that technical term<br>of custom-based colonial jurisprudence<br>about the incorporation of custom into<br>the common law<br>case of tanistries 1608 i think<br>campbell and hall 17 i can't remember 17<br>something<br>and the supreme court in takamote simply<br>says without applying any of the tests<br>in those long applied cases<br>that tikanga is part of the values of<br>the common law<br>cultural background history of<br>deprivation<br>loss of mana in rangatiratanga walks<br>into the sentencing process<br>it's hard to imagine that an appellate<br>court<br>of a decade or two decades ago would<br>have been willing to even think about<br>that idea<br>let alone enact it judicially<br>in a guideline sentencing decision<br>and now the chief district court judge<br>who's a maori<br>mainstreaming the experience of the<br>rangatahi court and the matariki courts<br>the therapeutic approach to dealing with<br>offenders<br>for everybody everybody<br>of course there is a significant<br>asymmetry<br>on the maori side in terms of engagement<br>with the criminal justice system<br>so<br>with all that in mind with those signs<br>with bearing<br>those signs in mind i think we can see<br>of the country and the direction<br>of travel of the law we might want to<br>debate about pace<br>we might want to debate about whether<br>it's going to divert 10 degrees that way<br>or 10 degrees that way<br>but we are not debating direction<br>either in the law or in the way we see<br>ourselves<br>bright young lawyer who wrote a great<br>article in the i'm sorry it's in the<br>auckland university law review but<br>he probably went to otago name krishnan<br>suggests in a recent article that the<br>master's tools<br>will never dismantle the masters houses<br>he says law is never going to do this<br>and judges certainly not they've never<br>done it before even when they're<br>purporting to be just<br>and purporting to redress historic<br>wrongs they've never actually done more<br>than entrench the status quo<br>so he says if changes to happen at all<br>it's going to be parliamentary<br>or nothing i'm not sure i agree<br>decolonization is too big a job to be<br>left to one player<br>in our legal system even one as<br>important and powerful<br>the great rule of carter military and<br>religious leader of the 19th century<br>when i'm gone and he died about two<br>years later when i'm gone<br>you should peddle the law's canoe<br>only the law has the power<br>to defeat the law by which he meant<br>only laws of liberation can<br>undo laws of oppression i'm always<br>struck by that because<br>this was a man who should have owed<br>nothing at<br>all to the law given the way the law<br>treated him for much of his<br>leadership i don't have time to go into<br>it but<br>that is an extraordinary statement for<br>someone<br>with his history and his experience of<br>colonial law<br>you see he saw the law as a kind of<br>monolithic metaphor for colonial power<br>he drew no distinction between the<br>politicians the judges and the<br>bureaucrats<br>and he was in our context right<br>i think colonial law was imposed<br>cooperatively by the various<br>institutional expressions of colonial<br>power<br>each branch shared a common purpose<br>sometimes the common purpose was<br>explicit<br>that is it was driven by legislation<br>which said<br>the point is colonization or the point<br>is usurpation but more often<br>so i've come to the view that<br>decolonizing the law will always be<br>a joint venture this time<br>it'll be a common enterprise between the<br>legislature<br>the executive the judiciary<br>now it may not surprise you to know that<br>i'm not particularly learned in the<br>detail of the law<br>if i'm presented with a legal problem<br>the first thing i have to do is work out<br>what category of problem this is the<br>chief justice<br>which is in need of constant renovation<br>she says<br>so if we if you allow me to pick up that<br>metaphor<br>then the first thing i have to do is<br>work out what room<br>this problem belongs to and then<br>once i've figured that out i ask myself<br>what area<br>within the room is the area i need to<br>search<br>i keep having this image and my head is<br>ferreting through my drawers that sort<br>and then sometimes the sub area<br>it's only then that i can begin my<br>search for the detailed reasoning path<br>to the answer that i think i might need<br>but the point is as long as i'm in the<br>right room<br>and the right area of the room the<br>skills<br>i learnt at law school will find<br>me the answer even if i don't know<br>so decolonization begins<br>when we come to see two new things<br>about the law's house<br>first that it has a few rooms in it<br>we hadn't noticed until now<br>you see they've been locked for so long<br>and second is that if we take the time<br>to look again into<br>the rooms with which we are familiar<br>but we look from a new angle<br>those rooms can take on quite a<br>different<br>complexion so decolonizing the law is<br>not about upsetting the fundamentals of<br>the common law<br>as we know it it's about training<br>ourselves to see<br>it through a different lens<br>that is and this is the trick i think<br>the law can comprise a colonial villa<br>and a farenui at the same time<br>depending on your viewing angle<br>in some parts that house will be a<br>hybrid<br>and in others it'll be distinctively<br>but it is no longer only<br>a colonial villa now there are already<br>lots of examples of us<br>working with this need for<br>optical dexterity excuse my<br>mixed metaphors in the resource<br>management act<br>fanongatanga in family law mana<br>but for much of the last 40 years the<br>introduction of tikanga elements into<br>our law<br>was intentionally modest<br>ameliorative and non-disruptive<br>and often to be fair ham fisted<br>see the original definition of<br>kaityakitanga in the resource management<br>act<br>or the colonial way in which the courts<br>defined whose culture decided<br>tikanga is powerful because<br>it teaches us that the law is in fact<br>a shape shifter changing our frame of<br>reference<br>the law is a construct<br>so the process of decolonization can now<br>begin i suggest<br>where necessary that which was simply<br>assumed can be contested<br>or affirmed through an alternative<br>tikanga based lens<br>when law is pluralized in this way we<br>allow ourselves to ask<br>why why does the law<br>have to be this way and even where the<br>legal directive is clear<br>whether by reason of its legislative<br>form or because it's contained<br>in long-standing authority that people<br>have relied on for a long time<br>we can still ask how how might tikanga<br>affect<br>these questions will sometimes produce<br>subtle and nuanced answers<br>but they can liberate the common lawyer<br>from at least<br>some of the constraints we imposed upon<br>ourselves<br>while flight floating in the<br>mid-atlantic<br>so how do the law schools<br>i'm not being a salesman when i say i<br>think the law schools are actually<br>the most important institutions<br>in addressing that challenge you see the<br>judges<br>are retail operators<br>we deal with problems served up to us<br>we don't choose them except in the<br>we can't turn up to court one day and<br>say i think i'm going to talk about<br>tax law today and i'm going to issue<br>some declarations we're not allowed to<br>do that<br>we deal with the problem in front of us<br>some may think they do<br>the legislature is a wholesale<br>institution<br>but even it only very rarely deals with<br>the whole category of law<br>dealing with relatively small areas of<br>the law<br>and expounding on what that law<br>should be<br>it's not the job of the legislatures or<br>their habit<br>to tend the entire architecture of the<br>law's house<br>that job is for the law schools<br>it's the academy that provides the<br>metasynthesis<br>that pres that presented to each<br>generation<br>of aspiring lawyers a cohesive<br>model of the law at least you've got to<br>try to do that<br>even if some of the material we judges<br>law schools have been around for a long<br>time<br>though full-time professional law<br>schools develop rather late in that<br>in the in this country that fact doesn't<br>diminish their role in confining the<br>common law imagination within acceptable<br>colonial bounds for the 60 years since a<br>law degree was made a prerequisite for<br>admission to the profession<br>and in some universities like this one<br>law schools have replicated the ethnic<br>socio-economic and until relatively<br>recently gender demographics<br>of the wider profession generation<br>after generation law schools have been<br>institutions that map<br>and replicate the status quo<br>they help to ensure that the ranks of<br>the legal profession<br>the judiciary and the public service are<br>populated<br>by the ruling class and that the content<br>so that's got to change<br>and i think you are in the process<br>harold johnson a cree<br>ex prosecutor from northern saskatchewan<br>who's also<br>and a harvard graduate in law<br>harvard masters graduate in law wrote<br>quite a hard-hitting memoir called peace<br>in guru the case for indigenous justice<br>in canada and i think it's one of the<br>best reads i've had in a while<br>he says this you don't have to be smart<br>to get through law school<br>but law school is not about teaching law<br>law school is about making sure<br>undesirable people<br>do not enter the legal profession<br>law school is not the bridge into the<br>profession<br>it's the gate it's there<br>to keep people out<br>johnson says he couldn't change the law<br>school<br>but it sure changed him<br>and a recent article by supreme court<br>new zealand supreme court clerk<br>imogen little suggests i think rather<br>persuasively<br>that the scenario painted by harold<br>johnson<br>is also the scenario here in new zealand<br>the law schools by turning a blind eye<br>to the educational inequality<br>in new zealand's schooling system and by<br>privileging<br>affluent students who are not brighter<br>or endowed with greater innate ability<br>have affirmed that consistent status quo<br>so that the the group of decile<br>8910 students dominate the law school<br>student body because according to<br>imogen little members<br>of that group benefit from better<br>quality education<br>and a greater store of social<br>and cultural capital now i<br>fully acknowledge that we've made some<br>progress<br>over time but nowhere near enough<br>given the level of asymmetry between<br>wealthy law school students<br>and poor ones between parque law school<br>students<br>gary peller an american academic<br>rights i think<br>persuasively that consistent exclusion<br>from the from the<br>legal profession of key groups in the<br>community is generally accepted<br>because it's assumed law school<br>admission is based on a neutral<br>a political meritocracy<br>the thinking goes that for whatever<br>reason many poor people<br>and here in this country many maori and<br>pacific islanders are just not up to the<br>rigors<br>of legal education if they were let in<br>in greater numbers they could undermine<br>the standards<br>of the profession in fact palace<br>suggests that the exclusion<br>is no longer even necessarily conscious<br>it has been that way for so long<br>that no one knows no one has any idea<br>how to change it<br>even if there was an inclination to do<br>so<br>the problem is as little demonstrates<br>the evidence that the barriers to entry<br>into law school accurately predict<br>performance in the profession<br>the law in this country cannot be<br>decolonized<br>if law school students are not from<br>so<br>that's the diversity of the student body<br>um what about diversity of legal content<br>introduced over the last generation bits<br>and pieces of diverse<br>legal content into the curriculum in all<br>of our law schools<br>but it's now clear that that approach is<br>not<br>going to cut it you see in 2019 the<br>called on each law school to give an<br>account of itself in terms of the<br>treatment of te kanga<br>boron foundation funded<br>project called for a bi-dural bicultural<br>bilingual legal education system<br>and in the end the council for legal<br>education<br>directed that tikanga maori must be a<br>law a core<br>component of legal education<br>and charged everybody with the task<br>of working out how to do it thanks cle<br>we're not the only ones uh to have had<br>to do this<br>the canadians and the australians are<br>also<br>walking down this path uh because<br>i've overrun my time rather badly sorry<br>dean<br>i'm not going to walk you through that<br>but in many ways<br>the canadians are ahead of us and<br>they've learned some lessons<br>that we would do well to learn too<br>the australians are doing it they one<br>university of western australia has a<br>five-year indigenisation of their jd<br>degree project and they seem<br>serious about making changes<br>how then do we begin our version of this<br>same<br>journey well we can learn a lot from the<br>australians<br>and the canadians there's a lot that's<br>similar about our circumstances<br>but we need to be cautious because there<br>are some things<br>that are quite different and we have<br>some natural advantages that i think are<br>worth exploring<br>and exploiting now<br>i want to start with the content<br>of tikanga<br>one of the key problems in teaching<br>tikanga in our law schools<br>which as i've said are<br>key institutions in this project<br>is the relative superficiality of<br>tikanga material that's taught<br>and the capacity gap in most law<br>faculties<br>in terms of teaching it<br>it's not unrealistic to expect that a<br>tikanga course would contain the same<br>depth of material<br>as a commercial or property law course<br>but where's that material to be found<br>some of it's in written form<br>but unlike the commercial or property<br>law cases our courses<br>some will be in the form of oral<br>tradition and some will of necessity<br>be experiential most of it will not be<br>law in the way law schools are used to<br>teaching it<br>but that's the point as i've said at its<br>best<br>learning tikanga liberates the minds of<br>common lawyers<br>so that they can see the farenui where<br>they once<br>only saw a colonial villa<br>what i suspect the law schools don't<br>understand is there is a<br>vast treasure trove of tikanga based<br>material from which<br>to teach this subject the 19th and 20th<br>20th century european ethnographers<br>the reports of the waitangi tribunal<br>decisions of the maori land court<br>and occasionally of the environment<br>court and the evidence<br>given to the waitangi tribunal on<br>subjects of debate around tikanga<br>then there are the maori language<br>sources<br>which if you're going to be serious<br>about this have to be engaged with<br>the writings of 19th century uh scribes<br>like te rangi ka heke te tira morehu<br>tami hanatero parahati<br>and so on then there are the hundreds<br>literally hundreds of native land court<br>minute books<br>that record the debates between<br>hapu over who has rights where and why<br>in the larger more contested cases<br>individual<br>matanga or experts in rangatira gave<br>evidence for days on end<br>without notes they used whakapapa<br>they used fakataki proverbs they used<br>wayata they used taka<br>just as i did they used karakia to weave<br>complex social economic military and<br>political histories<br>to support their cases they record who<br>gathered food where and how often<br>who those resource complex complexes<br>were shared with<br>the whakapapa connection between those<br>right-holding kin groups<br>who won when they quarreled how the<br>quarrel affected the interests of the<br>victors<br>and the vanquished the underlying<br>philosophies and principles of te karere<br>have to be extracted from what is said<br>they are not<br>those minutes are tikanga law<br>as it is being done so<br>there's tiwayata atu teremoana very<br>famous waiata that<br>tells the story that is composed<br>at the birth describes the birth process<br>and teaches law<br>teaches law in the waiata you can find<br>it<br>in a book called na muta<br>there's the wonderful partere<br>of puhi wahine a woman from ngatiawa<br>ngatiapa who celebrates mana wahine<br>and it is one of the most beautiful<br>wayata<br>ever composed by these polynesians<br>and it explains why manawahine<br>is a thing you have to engage with that<br>material<br>there's the famous story of rata cuts<br>down the tree<br>doesn't do the right karakias the<br>insects and the birds<br>and they deliver and the cool thing is<br>the song that the insects and birds sung<br>we know the words and it's still still<br>you have transgressed our laws and you<br>will pay the price<br>and essentially what tanimoto the god of<br>the forest did was issue<br>an asset forfeiture order<br>against against rata and<br>reappropriated his property<br>this material is so rich and so powerful<br>but you have to have eyes to see it<br>then there are the oral and experiential<br>sources because<br>you can't teach in a classroom at least<br>not a classroom only<br>you have to go to the villages<br>you have to listen to the elders because<br>they will tell you<br>and they're right that the land is the<br>book<br>and they'll name off places and tell you<br>the human stories related to each place<br>the farenui is a book and they'll name<br>off the whakapapa<br>contained in the farenui that<br>demonstrates the right of those people<br>to that land but you've got to have eyes<br>to see it this is tikanga law<br>right in front of us completely<br>invisible<br>to law school graduates okay<br>in law schools can't do this alone<br>it's too hard the capacity isn't there<br>you will have to reach out across<br>disciplinary boundaries you're going to<br>have to break down walls<br>you're going to have to reach out to<br>maori studies departments<br>where the stories that i've told you<br>about the minutes<br>the ethnographer's writings and so on is<br>bread and butter<br>in those places they know this stuff<br>much better than i do<br>you have to break out of your<br>institutions<br>where the practitioners tend to collect<br>now practitioners<br>like hatha actual practitioners<br>for whom you can in a rich conversation<br>extract a law that you've never<br>conceived of before just by having the<br>two houses<br>in the one room that means for the most<br>part<br>except at the most superficial level<br>tikanga is going to have to be<br>team taught you're going to have to have<br>a<br>orthodox legally trained person and<br>someone<br>a tikanga practitioner working together<br>to teach this stuff it's too hard for<br>one alone<br>and then there's going into the<br>communities on the land in the water<br>diving for kinners even in dunedin<br>now there's a payoff in this by engaging<br>with this material<br>the law schools contribute to the<br>restoration of tikama<br>because tikanga has taken a whacking for<br>the last 100 years<br>by engaging with this material by<br>teaching it by working with communities<br>you help to shore it up you help<br>to strengthen it through debate<br>and discussion tikanga is not some<br>immutable thing<br>sacred set in stone to tapu<br>don't doubt it it's not like that it<br>never was<br>if you read the maori land court minutes<br>the native language minutes you'll see<br>our old people loved to debate about<br>tikanga and how it applied<br>that's why they raced to court i think<br>they just loved<br>so community-based learning means you're<br>not just teaching tikanga<br>you're teaching in tikanga you're<br>teaching in tikanga<br>with tikanga practitioners now that's a<br>new way of doing law<br>and i sure wish that when i went to law<br>school<br>we had that opportunity because i would<br>have been a much better lawyer<br>okay<br>the burden on maori staff i do want to<br>mention that<br>ruth bader ginsburg said of the first<br>few years that she was in the<br>supreme court that she had to spend a<br>lot of time educating her<br>brethren that's the correct term uh<br>about<br>sexism and the law and she said it was<br>like being a kindergarten teacher<br>and i suspect that for maori staff<br>members in<br>law faculties it'll feel a lot like that<br>a lot too often in addition to educating<br>encouraging and cajoling your colleagues<br>maori staff are also going to be the<br>heaviest burden in terms of teaching<br>techno material and they're going to in<br>my<br>vision of it they're going to team teach<br>it and that's resource intensive<br>and hard to control and sometimes<br>they're not going to be the teacher<br>they're going to be a facilitator of<br>teaching<br>community based learning diving for<br>kenner<br>is going to be burdensome probably<br>and at the same time maori academics<br>will be required to bring their most<br>thoughtful and creative minds<br>to the task of developing a new<br>curriculum<br>that they will have to deliver to a<br>student body that may not always be well<br>disposed to it<br>they'll need lots of support and<br>encouragement<br>the road is likely to be bumpy for them<br>particularly in the first few years<br>above all can i suggest to the<br>brass of the university they must be<br>valued<br>other disciplines have made the mistake<br>of expecting their maori staff<br>to be all things to all people at a<br>discount<br>the law schools must not make<br>the same mistake where the hell are we<br>going to get all the money for this<br>it's attempting to avoid this most<br>important of all questions<br>at least to law school deans anyway by<br>saying money isn't my area<br>i just do law but that would be a little<br>unfair it seems to me that<br>we must resource this adventure in the<br>same way that i suggest<br>we teach it through interdisciplinary<br>inter-institutional inter-community<br>cooperation this is going to be a<br>two-way street<br>at lots of levels with maori studies<br>departments<br>now i tried to write<br>a conclusion this afternoon<br>and i don't know how this is going to<br>end i really don't<br>i know we have to do this for the sake<br>of al te roi let alone for the sake of<br>law in al te roa<br>we could trip up<br>but i feel there's enough goodwill<br>that with patience on both sides<br>and an honest and courageous attempt to<br>make a difference<br>now i know we've kept you like 20<br>minutes too long already and you know<br>your lawyer's time is money<br>but my relations all came here<br>to um represent and<br>uh we have this ancient wayata of ours<br>about an ancestor that we all share<br>named kamoki terangi<br>and i was thinking it's not sung very<br>often at home<br>um because it's quite difficult it's a<br>it's a pre-cook<br>waiata uh and i we're gonna have a go at<br>singing it to you and i want to um<br>who composed this in the old way she<br>composes it<br>ex-tempo next to her brother's<br>body and she extols<br>his courage and power the opening line<br>is<br>kamoki tarangi has been lost to us and<br>he<br>was the greatest and that's in a<br>muhammad ali kind of way<br>he was the greatest and she talks about<br>the battles that he fought<br>and how he eventually succumbed not to a<br>weapon<br>but to makutu a mosquito bite a sandwich<br>sorry<br>but through that we don't have time to<br>talk to you about it<br>but through that is a whole pile of law<br>this is how it sounds in this kind of<br>textbook<br>i'm going to turn this over i'll<br>dominate<br>sorry are there people next door<br>tell them somebody pick up a handheld<br>handheld mic oh okay somebody grab it<br>and turn it on make sure it's on green<br>you see the thing about kamoki is that<br>foreign<br>my<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>hi<br>my<br>my<br>i<br>i<br>and i'm just going to take the<br>opportunity to say a few words on behalf<br>of the law faculty<br>um i'm a lecturer in the law faculty<br>here at the university of otago<br>and i'm actually the newest lecturer<br>here so it's quite a privilege to be<br>able to say a few words<br>to acknowledge and also professor frank<br>guest<br>in 1996 the ewgest memorial lecture was<br>delivered by the the injustice eddie<br>jury<br>his address was titled will the settlers<br>settle<br>cultural conciliation and law<br>in his lecture surgery called on us to<br>hone our jurisprudence<br>in recognition that our law comes from<br>two streams<br>each bringing its own intellectual and<br>cultural tradition<br>today tajo has challenged us among other<br>things<br>to reflect on how these two streams of<br>law are taught in our law<br>schools and on that we might ask a<br>series of questions<br>who is involved in the teaching what<br>knowledge do they require<br>do we need to reconceptualize<br>traditional teaching roles<br>in traditional teaching spaces<br>personally i'm quite excited that i'll<br>get to go out there with hannah with my<br>this is a conversation that concerns all<br>of us in the law but obviously it most<br>especially concerns our law faculty<br>staff<br>and those who will be guiding and<br>directing our staff<br>in this next phase it also concerns our<br>students both present and future and on<br>that note i want to acknowledge all of<br>our law student associations<br>who will be at the forefront of these<br>conversations and i particularly want to<br>acknowledge our<br>means those who search for reasons or<br>who seek origins<br>i know that the students in telugu are<br>curious committed<br>and creative they are already seeking to<br>understand why things are the way they<br>are<br>at law school and asking what might be<br>different in the future<br>and i want to meet some students in<br>particular who in the course of<br>preparing for tajo's visit<br>became our teachers they taught the law<br>faculty staff son wayata that we could<br>perform in this setting<br>and i had no doubt that this was a<br>i think that the best acknowledgement of<br>your support that we can each<br>make is if we as staff continue to do<br>the work<br>of learning how to move confidently in<br>bicultural and bilingual settings<br>and we need those skills if we are to<br>deliver a bi-dural<br>system of legal education<br>lastly to acknowledge tajo himself who<br>has asked us this evening<br>to change our minds<br>to unlock the locked room to be<br>cautious but to be courageous<br>the challenge has been laid down<br>so i've now invited karen goodman's<br>president of the otago branch of the law<br>society to say a few words<br>and following that tv eliot the current<br>president of kirobu fair kutake<br>will present tajir with a gift while we<br>all join in singing a waiata<br>thank you taijo for that challenging<br>speech<br>given the tumultuous events of the last<br>13 months<br>that it's taken us some time to be able<br>to get you into this room<br>but it has certainly been well worth the<br>wait<br>we are particularly over the last two<br>years or so seeing movement and<br>recognizing te kanga as part of the law<br>and incorporating it into everyone's<br>daily life<br>as you said some of the moves do<br>sometimes feel like mere tokens<br>but there is a feeling of a positive<br>mutually beneficial<br>and transformative process that your<br>honor spoke of<br>your reflections on the developments of<br>the last 50 years or so through<br>polynesian lens were particularly<br>fascinating<br>now the moves that we are seeing are<br>being led by the more experienced<br>members of the profession and society<br>and not parliament not just parliament<br>rather<br>but as you said true change restoration<br>perhaps<br>must surely be strongly seeded from the<br>law schools working in partnership<br>with those people and we see<br>plenty of young people here tonight who<br>are clearly interested<br>in being part of that transformative<br>change<br>otaga law school has a proud history of<br>intellectual debate as fostered by frank<br>guest and his successes<br>and is well placed to be part of that<br>partnership you envisage<br>what better place could there be to do<br>the mahi<br>and positively debate and challenge what<br>the law is<br>how law is taught what law is taught<br>who it is taught to who the law works<br>for<br>and who the law does not work for i'm<br>certain that otago will live up to the<br>challenge<br>and we can look forward to working<br>together to take that leap of<br>imagination<br>and see ourselves as a polynesian island<br>diversity and viewpoint is one way of<br>starting to take that leap and<br>decolonize the law<br>so the future shapers of the law do not<br>only look at it from one perspective<br>as you alluded to the faculty and the<br>profession are already working together<br>to consider what we can do to influence<br>the demographics of those<br>influencing i'm sorry of those entering<br>the law school<br>and you have challenged us to do so much<br>more<br>tener<br>uh<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>me<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
