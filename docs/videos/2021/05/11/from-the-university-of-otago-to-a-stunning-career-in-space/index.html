hello<br>hi bill hi bill nice to see you bill<br>yeah i am marie yeah and sheila<br>also lovely<br>nice to see you i'm not driving don't<br>worry<br>we did notice that you were in your car<br>phil welcome good to see you<br>when we get started we will ask everyone<br>to put their<br>uh selves back on mute so that we don't<br>i'm having a bear to fortify myself for<br>bit bit early in the morning here for<br>and marie i can still remember how what<br>must be<br>12 14 years ago when i met you for the<br>first time and i said hey i think you're<br>bored<br>board member material i managed to be<br>for a whole 10 years bill<br>ah good on you yeah no there<br>yeah i remember that university club san<br>francisco yeah one of the best decisions<br>and after you talk my dear i'm going to<br>mention<br>uh an old astrophysicist he's<br>dead now called fred singer who used to<br>do experiments<br>early on using v2 rockets that they<br>brought over<br>bill sounds like a bit of fireworks<br>there yeah they had<br>they had to jettison all the information<br>out the side to come down by parachute<br>because the rockets went up and then<br>let me see how are we doing on time uh<br>we're one minute past the hour so i'm<br>going to<br>ask everybody to please put yourself<br>on mute and we will get started and use<br>this precious time<br>so uh good morning good afternoon and<br>good evening all<br>i'm jacinta calvary i am the secretary<br>of auoa which is the<br>alumni of the university of otago in<br>america<br>i'm truly a southlander at heart always<br>have been<br>always will be and so it's a real<br>pleasure<br>today to be welcoming everybody to<br>our meeting here uh on behalf of the<br>board<br>of auoa and extending an apology from<br>our president<br>john o wong who is otherwise engaged at<br>the office i'm afraid<br>it's a real privilege to be able to<br>uh present to you this evening<br>anne-marie owen and also<br>professor craig roger who is going to<br>help us with this event<br>and i'm first going to turn this over to<br>sheila murray to talk to you a little<br>bit about the work from the university<br>and then we'll pick up and get the show<br>kiara thank you jacinta um hello<br>everybody<br>i'm sheila murray i'm the director of<br>development and alumni<br>at the university of otago in dunedin<br>it's another beautiful<br>autumn day here so thank you everyone<br>for coming along thank you emery<br>for um of what will be a very exciting<br>presentation<br>and thank you to the aua board for um<br>helping us put this on<br>we are very happy to be the behind the<br>scenes organization of this but<br>it's all up to the auoa board to um<br>have these suggestions and put these<br>ideas together so i hope all of you<br>alumni<br>thoroughly enjoy which i think will be a<br>very exciting presentation<br>and i look forward to getting some of<br>the feedback um so go well<br>thanks everyone thank you sheila<br>and as sheila said as the auoa board<br>we're delighted to be able to<br>present to you one of our previous board<br>members and current member of our<br>advisory group a very esteemed role<br>but i think anne-marie has a very<br>esteemed career that would also<br>love to acknowledge in this session<br>tonight in fact<br>when i was uh determining how to<br>introduce her i couldn't decide to start<br>at the beginning or the end<br>so i'm actually going to start in the<br>middle anne-marie<br>and say that one of the amazing things<br>that anne-marie has done<br>in her career is to achieve the first<br>atom trap and she will have to tell you<br>what that means when she presents this<br>evening<br>but anne-marie has a long and<br>illustrious career<br>in industry but starting out with her<br>phd<br>in physics from otago she was<br>a rhodes scholar finalist she has<br>worked for a number of very high profile<br>companies<br>in the us both as a project engineer<br>a chief systems engineer and a campaign<br>lead at l3 harris technologies<br>anne-marie previously worked at lockheed<br>martin space<br>and so this for me is like a trip down<br>some kind of movie theater as we look at<br>all of her accomplishments over the<br>years<br>emery received an association of women<br>in science scholarship<br>as an undergraduate as i mentioned she<br>went on to complete her phd at otago<br>and she contributed or gave back to the<br>university<br>uh by taking a role on our board for 10<br>years from 2009 to 2019<br>and i had the privilege of a slight<br>overlap<br>but now we have the increased privilege<br>of anne-marie and others on this call<br>being our advisory board to keep us on<br>the straight and narrow<br>this event is is the fourth that we've<br>presented<br>under covert conditions we're getting<br>pretty<br>accomplished at providing online<br>interactions we're delighted to see all<br>of you here this evening<br>but we also look forward to the day when<br>we'll be able to meet in person<br>and you'll be able to get your autograph<br>from anne-marie so on on that note and<br>marie i'm handing off<br>to you thank you jacinta what a lovely<br>introduction<br>uh let's take a moment i'm gonna share<br>my screen<br>because uh in the uh aerospace industry<br>who are we without our powerpoint<br>charts so uh<br>can jacinta do you see my my charts<br>there<br>wonderful well hi everybody um<br>22 years ago when i had<br>started off as a young research<br>scientist in<br>america uh i met the director of<br>research at wright pat<br>air force base and it was pointed out to<br>him<br>that my name's initials spell ammo<br>as in guns and ammo so that is my<br>nickname dr annemarie oyen<br>ammo that has proven useful<br>in the ensuing career that i have had<br>there we are who am i uh well yeah<br>jacinta you covered the early points it<br>wasn't the first adam trap<br>but it was the first in the southern<br>hemisphere<br>i tried to be accurate<br>and i did both my underground and my phd<br>in otago is just into noted and just a<br>little bit about me<br>um i was born in the united states<br>and moved to new zealand when i was a<br>wee young five-year-old<br>but we would go back periodically to the<br>united states<br>uh and one of the things i got the<br>privilege of doing was seeing star wars<br>about a year before<br>the movie star wars before people in new<br>zealand did because back in the day they<br>must put film reels on the ship<br>so uh that was very exciting and that i<br>guess that i<br>start my uh space career with that event<br>got my plastic lightsaber uh then i<br>became a research scientist for 10 years<br>work<br>on lasers i also did some managing of<br>projects<br>i picked up the software development<br>technique called agile<br>and then somehow along the way a year or<br>two ago i managed to become a fellow<br>in uh industry that's where they<br>recognize<br>where you you've done quite a bit of<br>work and are have achieved a mastery in<br>a technical field so i was<br>uh happy to to get to that point with<br>alfred harris technologies<br>um so i started in a small company when<br>i moved to america<br>uh i was employee number 76<br>we grew to about 300 people at coherent<br>technologies inc<br>and then we got acquired by a slightly<br>bigger company<br>lockheed martin had 120 000<br>employees at the time uh and then i saw<br>an opportunity to<br>to make the break and move into the<br>broader landscape which meant i got my<br>first introduction to<br>space satellite development of the<br>vehicles<br>of whole sets of vehicles called<br>constellations<br>massive programs of hundreds of people<br>building satellites and<br>and huge clean rooms um<br>so when you put that together with the<br>l3 harris technologies where i spent<br>three years i have a total of 12 years<br>in the us space industry<br>and during that time i<br>learned to lead teams that were on<br>programs building and sustaining<br>space flight safety systems kind of like<br>a<br>airport traffic control there's<br>a sets of people sitting at computers<br>looking at information about where space<br>satellites are<br>and making sure they're flying safe<br>and um as part of that i went to the<br>space symposium a few times<br>actually held right here in colorado and<br>that's where i got the opportunity to<br>meet<br>one person called peter back<br>we might know that name he's a ceo and<br>founder of rocket labs<br>and it was just nice to hear kiwi voice<br>and amongst the<br>exhibit hall and uh and in fact<br>uh my mum knows his mum in classic<br>southland fashion so<br>it was my opening line and we had a<br>little chat<br>and i'm very proud to touch on<br>some of peterbach's successes in this<br>talk because he's a real game changer in<br>the space industry<br>um let me see oh yes i wrote this talk<br>in october<br>but since then i have had the audacity<br>to retire<br>so i retired january and uh i'm a bit of<br>a ski bum and dilettante for now<br>but this is still relevant i went on and<br>i checked my numbers<br>and and this stuff is still very much<br>happening and continuing<br>so that's who i am and now<br>i'd like to go to who the company was<br>that i work for so you get a sense of<br>the kind of industry<br>uh that we work in so i'm going to do a<br>brief profile<br>of l3 harris technologies and i had this<br>all okay with their communications<br>uh people but it's it's headed up by<br>these<br>two gentlemen uh bill brown is the ceo<br>and chris kubasik as the<br>chief operating officer and harris<br>eltrie harris<br>is about the sixth biggest uh<br>in the aerospace industry uh lockheed<br>martin's a behemoth<br>united uh with raytheon and joining us<br>also a large company<br>we're kind of the scrappier smaller<br>company but still my own 18 billion<br>dollars revenue a year<br>it started as a small aircraft type<br>company but then it grew and grew and<br>grew in communications<br>and if there's one thing you need to<br>manage space satellites is<br>communications<br>so l3 harris has moved very well<br>into the space industry um here's the<br>the four divisions that it's made up<br>with and then<br>using um very uh you know<br>military type language of missions i<br>worked in the second<br>from the left space and airborne systems<br>for<br>ed zoice and um what we were working on<br>was all aspects of space it was it<br>wasn't just<br>making satellites which tended to be<br>more lockheed martin focused it was also<br>about the ground<br>stations it was about controlling the<br>satellites it was about<br>safety it was about what's up there and<br>are we aware<br>a situational awareness so to speak<br>so uh that was the space side of space<br>and airborne systems but their<br>communication systems ten<br>while it tended to be ground-based means<br>that<br>uh they're kind of everywhere l3 harris<br>they they got radios gps receivers<br>uh and you'll find l3 harris equipment<br>on every<br>satellite up there basically it's just<br>one of those essential bread and butters<br>of space<br>so it was really exciting to be in that<br>sudden entry point into the space<br>industry as it started<br>to really really grow<br>global footprint this typical big 18<br>billion dollar<br>company or so uh they're everywhere and<br>if you notice<br>you'll see a tiny little little country<br>down there<br>new zealand and i found out that what l3<br>harris does is they have<br>a pilot training set up near hamilton<br>and um they have very sophisticated<br>simulation systems where you sit in<br>there's a screen and you basically feel<br>like you're flying a plane<br>and this is how pilots get simulated<br>flight hours<br>in their journey to becoming a certified<br>commercial pilot<br>so although harris has presence in new<br>zealand<br>as well as the obvious other places that<br>we have on the world here<br>hundred countries customers in a hundred<br>countries<br>350 locations uh l3 harris is the small<br>one<br>with only 48 000 employees<br>um but uh yeah it's uh<br>it's a pretty big company with a decent<br>footprint in the space industry<br>so why why space why<br>it costs a lot to go up there why do it<br>well the view is great uh<br>it it creates that map of the world uh<br>you go to google earth you look up your<br>house you go on<br>zillow there's your house<br>and that is by satellites<br>groups of satellites flying around and<br>taking pictures<br>the weather data because you have global<br>access you get<br>um regular update pictures of earth<br>with um information about weather that<br>can be<br>temperature um you know and<br>um cloud cover and a variety of other<br>elements that<br>improve the accuracy of weather<br>predictions like hurricanes<br>elsie harris is in this game too<br>uh i think they've just won a contract<br>with noah which is our weather<br>uh company national<br>entity here in america uh in<br>we can find the the baddies we can find<br>the polluters<br>we can track our wildfires<br>uh forests ice shelves we know the ice<br>shelves have been shrinking<br>and we can track that and that in itself<br>provides us tremendous amounts of data<br>in terms of tracking what's happening to<br>our world<br>tourism i think there was a new york<br>times feature recently the first space<br>tourists that simply<br>shelled out 20 million dollars and and<br>had the russians take them up in a soyuz<br>rocket<br>uh now um we i know to date as of last<br>october there are 10<br>private tours who have flown um<br>so that that's uh coming in the future<br>more of that one of the key things that<br>space does is not just a great view<br>but it tells you where you are the<br>location system<br>uh the global positioning system first<br>uh built by u.s air force other<br>countries are building their own<br>it's become an essential part we have<br>this and<br>every one of our iphones we have a<br>receiver listening to the signals that<br>these<br>satellites are sending in radio waves<br>uh to help us with where we are and<br>navigate when we drive our cars<br>um the other one uh global<br>communications was actually dreamed up<br>originally in 1945 by arthur c<br>clarke the science fiction writer<br>and he uh surmised that if you could put<br>three satellites up way out there<br>36 000 kilometers away they would be<br>able to see the whole<br>earth and be able to transmit signals<br>around the earth<br>i'm old enough to remember that if we<br>made one of those<br>all-important toll calls from new<br>zealand to america to talk to the<br>grandparents<br>there are seconds and seconds of delay<br>of the signal going along the<br>underground<br>cabling system so imagine if you have<br>instant global access with<br>communications how important that<br>is to us and how dependent we are on it<br>there's low earth orbit satellites they<br>take better<br>pictures of earth because they're closer<br>they're at about 400 to 800 kilometers<br>away and um they<br>have i'll show you i have a model this<br>is my model of the earth my meraka<br>and what you do is geostationary is way<br>out here<br>moving along the same speed<br>as my maraca in one day goes around the<br>same time in one day as the earth<br>rotates<br>so all you need is one little ground<br>station here<br>under the palm tree and then um that's<br>all you need to stay in contact with the<br>satellite so it's cheapest chips<br>to uh to monitor that thing um<br>and so that was sort of the original<br>sort of satellite it was way out there<br>and it was just going around slowly but<br>with leo<br>you take better pictures now in order to<br>not get sucked into the gravity of earth<br>they have to spin around pasta<br>and essentially they're going around and<br>orbit and they paint a picture kind of a<br>squiggly line like this<br>and it shifts along every time so<br>eventually<br>every one half two hours they've<br>circumnavigated<br>done their orbit and you've got pictures<br>from uh where they can access<br>so um it's not just the practical stuff<br>there's science at the frontier going on<br>uh microgravity life sciences what<br>happens to organisms<br>in space with how does gravity matter i<br>mean we've only recently figured out<br>how it affects our vision when<br>astronauts stay for a long time<br>at the international space station um<br>and they grow two inches in height from<br>the microgravity<br>physical sciences um studying the<br>radiation<br>i'm hoping later that craig will tell us<br>a little bit more about some of the work<br>that uh his team are doing uh<br>and remote sensing so looking for<br>pollution and and landscape contours<br>with radio waves<br>and um the gases like monitoring carbon<br>dioxide emissions<br>with laser radar and it's not just<br>looking in<br>this looking out so l3 harris is<br>involved with<br>uh we know about the hubble telescope<br>looking at the universe there are post<br>hubble<br>telescopes also looking with high<br>resolution<br>uh out at the universe and<br>uh exploration get in the ship and go<br>where no one has gone before um<br>and uh exploring other planets<br>colonization<br>learn about our universe that fun stuff<br>and basic<br>research and i got this photo from<br>nasa just showing you two astronauts in<br>action uh with their uh experiments i<br>think it's in life sciences<br>um so yeah space is awfully<br>me see i'm going to go to our next chart<br>and now i want to cover<br>how space works what to do<br>to get things up to space so<br>i've got a simple six step process to<br>get things<br>up and running um gross simplification<br>um the basis we can do this might be one<br>and a half years<br>used to be it took ten years to get this<br>all going<br>uh to build the satellite and of course<br>rocket lab<br>and uh peter back there they're working<br>on weekly launches but<br>let's go through the process because<br>everyone has to do this to get there<br>first number one launch a rocket with a<br>space vehicle in it and then at the top<br>of the rocket there's these shells that<br>break off<br>called pharynx that uh on top of the<br>rocket sits the actual<br>space satellite that's going to<br>disconnect and float around<br>in orbit around the world so once it's<br>in orbit<br>you need to unfurl the solar arrays<br>and then you've got power when you light<br>it up because you need power to run your<br>you know sensors and they can be<br>concertina where they just un<br>unfold uh i've actually uh think<br>scene of one where mechanism is like a<br>part of streamer party streamers<br>you know and it just unfurls um<br>and once they're lit uh with power<br>electricity um then they're they're um<br>get into orbit and we check they're okay<br>and we regularly check they're okay so<br>from the ground we have a ground station<br>that ping<br>says hello how are you doing and the<br>satellite says well my solar arrays are<br>working i got power and this is this<br>part is this temperature and things are<br>are going well and that's called<br>telemetry<br>and we also do tracking check double<br>check the satellites where it's supposed<br>to be<br>uh and then we have on that<br>satellite we have the payload which is<br>basically the sensor that does<br>the stuff we paid for now you might not<br>see next to the number four<br>on the uh powerpoint there but i've made<br>a facsimile of a similar thing<br>this is the camera phone as aptly built<br>by brett mckenzie in flight of the<br>concourse<br>and essentially this is what every<br>payload is in a satellite so<br>you you take a picture with camera with<br>radio or<br>uh visible light rays and then your<br>phone at home<br>so that's that's pretty much what they<br>are and they just connect to the<br>to the power on the satellite and that<br>is uh what we're flying around up there<br>essentially so next<br>we need to check where we're at and we<br>need to uh<br>know uh where we're pointed so that when<br>we want the picture of our house so<br>important on google earth we need to<br>know exactly how the satellite is<br>pointing to take the photo<br>and for that we use a star tracker to<br>get the gross alignment<br>it's essentially a map of the stars<br>above<br>and we align to that and it says yep yep<br>we know where you are now<br>and then we also have a gps receiver<br>so up there in space it's also receiving<br>signal just like our iphone<br>and it tells us our exact location and<br>with those two bits we get our precision<br>navigation and timing and uh that keeps<br>this<br>aligned and going um and then there's<br>ongoing housekeeping we got to manage<br>the satellite<br>host or the bus we have to manage our<br>payload or sensor<br>we create our photos or images or<br>whatever the data<br>is is share it wind sensing is another<br>one that<br>my husband actually specializes in he's<br>on here today too<br>uh from space uh for for weather<br>prediction<br>um and we have um<br>yeah in my our case the camera phone<br>pretty much sums up what a sensor does<br>so of course we need an important number<br>seven<br>which is what happens when a satellite<br>has run its lifetime<br>and i'm going to talk about that in a<br>little bit because<br>i was looking at the news and we have<br>the chinese rocket stage<br>long mart 5 march 5b<br>a big thing and it's tumbling in a<br>complex way<br>and we pretty much figured out as i'm<br>going<br>enter re-enter earth's atmosphere may<br>eight<br>a couple of days here one or two days<br>depending on your perspective<br>um and uh because it's large enough<br>there may be little bits of debris<br>that make it through atmosphere and land<br>probably in the ocean<br>usually if things are small they just<br>burn up with the friction from air<br>so uh stay tuned we'll talk about that<br>um that final disposal phase<br>uh oh yeah why is space hard<br>so um no atmosphere<br>is basically a vacuum and there are<br>atoms kilometers<br>kilometers apart um so it's pretty empty<br>there's a bit of atmosphere um what's<br>happening too is solar weather heats it<br>up<br>uh heats up the air and the air rises<br>and it actually increases drag and all<br>of those satellites that low earth<br>orbit hundreds of kilometers above the<br>earth sink a little bit<br>they get a little tired so they have<br>engines or propulsion<br>means on the satellites to boost them<br>back up and keep them in the orbit<br>they're supposed to be in<br>uh 30 brightest sun it's bright up there<br>um very hot or cold the international<br>space station<br>goes from 121 degrees celsius down to<br>minus 157<br>so we got to protect ourselves from the<br>radiation and the hot and cold<br>with multi-layer insulation short is<br>called<br>mli often gold colored so you see in<br>that picture<br>lower right that the sort of gold lemay<br>is not just for for grizzlies that is<br>your thermal<br>and shielding for<br>also radiation that stops radiation<br>there's no scattering blue sky this is a<br>very bright or dark<br>there's no twinkle the stars just stay<br>constant all the time<br>and occasionally these really bright<br>glints from satellites so it's a kind of<br>it you know some of these images that<br>they're they're kind of a pastiche it's<br>hard to take a good photo<br>as such a contrast um i'd mention this<br>orbiting pass<br>eleven thousand to twenty eight thousand<br>kilometers an hour<br>in what's called keplerian orbit and<br>that's the basic just of<br>two bodies attracted to each other<br>through gravity<br>staying at a a constant motion<br>they orbit and i'm going to demonstrate<br>that now<br>with my maracas here is earth<br>here is satellite and what that does<br>kepler said as it gets closer to the<br>earth it goes faster<br>and it goes further away it goes slower<br>it's like kind of bouncing up and down<br>so that is the basic kepler orbit<br>they're a bit more circular than that<br>but for the purposes of my<br>my screen i i kept it a little more<br>squidgy<br>um and and they all have a little<br>squidge<br>and and they all have um some variation<br>due to drag or even<br>solar pressure radiation pressure from<br>the sun<br>there's a whole field of astrodynamics<br>that studies<br>orbit movements and the fine adjustments<br>and what's happening up there um so<br>and i i got the privilege to work with<br>with these orbit<br>analysts as they call them applying is<br>basically a<br>baseline delta seven part um<br>differential equation<br>craig uh so anyway uh space debris<br>now every time we send something up if<br>something breaks off<br>um that doesn't seem so bad like a nut<br>or a bolt<br>but what if it's going at thousands of<br>kilometers an hour<br>it can hit like a bomb so one of my<br>favorite experiments that i heard about<br>from nasa was that they built a<br>satellite<br>and then they shot basically a micro<br>meteorite at<br>it like a little tiny marble type thing<br>to blow it up and what they wanted to do<br>was to measure how much and what size<br>debris<br>came off because back in 1978<br>a gentleman called donald kessler uh<br>started thinking about this and said<br>what if<br>there's enough satellites in the sky<br>that<br>if one satellite was to blow up through<br>an oopsie<br>it creates enough debris to then collide<br>and blow up<br>another satellite and he uh<br>lent his name to this delightful thing<br>existential nightmare called the kessler<br>syndrome<br>um so that's that's definitely something<br>also on our landscape to think about us<br>we're thinking of<br>space becoming more popular um<br>because of all of what it can do how do<br>we manage that<br>and essentially it becomes this traffic<br>control<br>and um a space command is essentially<br>airport uh traffic command uh<br>i met i met the vice chief<br>of space command general thompson<br>uh not not through because i was well<br>connected but just because i took his<br>chair<br>at a breakfast luncheon at the space<br>symposium<br>i i i thought this is a great seat right<br>in front of the podium i'll be able to<br>see<br>everything and here's this nice guy in a<br>full dress uniform<br>says excuse me i think i'm sitting there<br>like<br>so that's how i met general thompson<br>yeah<br>anyway um they they have a really<br>important job<br>and as we know we formed the space force<br>separate from the air force<br>army and so on um and he has<br>been doing amazing things to set up this<br>to<br>to manage space and also space<br>operations and that covers<br>just space flight safety as well as any<br>satellites they may have up there<br>too so um there's no<br>atmosphere and what that also means is<br>that radiation from solar flares<br>and solar winds and craig is an expert<br>in this<br>and even from outside galactic cosmic<br>rays<br>high energy high speed particles<br>they're harmful to people and they're<br>harmful to electronics<br>so what they they do is they put<br>shielding and aluminium is fabulous at<br>stopping these high-speed<br>high-energy particles but i i<br>love the idea that we finally have a<br>reason to<br>protect ourselves if we don't have the<br>protective effect of<br>of atmosphere up there and it's a real<br>reason but<br>you know because the shielding you don't<br>see too many astronauts<br>you know wearing wearing their uh their<br>brain<br>buckets<br>now what are we ah trends is what's<br>happening<br>in space industry so what i thought i'd<br>do is a compare and contrast<br>so on the left i'm talking about the era<br>from 1957 here launches sputnik<br>it's basically a basketball with a radio<br>antenna attached<br>sending out blips um and<br>uh here we have today april 2021<br>exemplified by rocket lab and there's a<br>picture of<br>our fellow kiwi peter beck<br>standing next to his electron rocket<br>which is achieving<br>the weekly launches<br>and with a capacity of 200 kilograms i<br>mean he's just going from strength to<br>strength<br>so based on that we can infer some of<br>the trends that are<br>happening in the future so it used to be<br>this was a game<br>for a privileged few a few government<br>satellites launching by two three big<br>nations<br>now nine nations are in there um<br>three thousand three hundred and seventy<br>two that's an update from last october<br>when i first wrote this um<br>used to be space domain activities<br>largely unobserved you send something<br>out there no one was looking for it<br>now we're watching that thing and if<br>with a few credentials<br>you can find a whole space satellite<br>catalog<br>with its prediction of where its orbits<br>gonna be<br>on spacetrack.org used to be<br>there's just a few of them at this<br>geostationary slower further out orbit<br>now we've got twenty six 000<br>softball sized or larger debris bits<br>or satellites and we need to have the<br>oversight to launch in orbit in fact<br>um back increasingly has to ask that<br>permission for the special launch window<br>i hope the weather is good because<br>that's when if he launches and takes<br>particular path that rocket will be<br>safe through the the catalog<br>objects used to be these satellites were<br>literally the size of buses i i would<br>see them being constructed<br>um in lockheed martin a high base<br>um in new jersey and colorado<br>and it's like a bus turning on its end<br>it's it's six seven meters high<br>uh coupled in that uh gold lemay um<br>and now uh we've got toaster and<br>kegerator psi<br>satellites they're launching in raichu<br>multiple satellites each pushed to its<br>own orbit<br>um global launches are more than weekly<br>so i updated this a week ago 33 launches<br>so far in 2021 i looked again today it's<br>38<br>um so we've really are tracking in terms<br>of uh how many launches and in fact<br>having multiple satellites<br>able to ride share on one rocket and<br>then be<br>put carefully into each of their<br>specific orbits when they get there<br>used to be it was only trained<br>government astronauts flying and now<br>and now we're where it was buying<br>tickets at 250<br>000 of pop to uh get on that commercial<br>flight<br>sometime in the future it used to be<br>just a technical feat to get there<br>and now it's almost like a service<br>space as a service sas<br>but it's also an element of star wars<br>coming<br>to reality uh we have the u.s space<br>force<br>that i worked for we have the chinese<br>people liberations army strategic<br>support force<br>we have the russian space forces and now<br>we have the australians involved<br>there is a recent article about how an<br>australian company has a laser<br>integrated in with the observatory on<br>top of<br>stromlow in australia and<br>um in fact they're trying to tackle this<br>tough problem of space debris<br>what they want to do is use a high<br>energy laser<br>track onto a debris that we want to get<br>out it's dangerous<br>and they're gonna use the laser to push<br>it with radiation pressure and shunt it<br>out of orbit<br>and the idea if you can get it out of<br>orbit it will eventually drift away its<br>base<br>or it will gradually fall because of the<br>the remnants of atmosphere<br>and burn up safely in the upper<br>atmosphere<br>in fact there's a variety of things<br>people are looking at<br>silly string so that they can connect<br>like an anchor<br>to um a piece of debris sort of a<br>spidey net so they launch a net from a<br>satellite onto debris<br>and increase its drag so it falls out<br>of danger uh oh<br>yes harpoon uh with precision<br>um munitions they might be able to<br>harpoon that sucker and<br>uh get rid of it that way there's a<br>and simple collection they call it<br>on-orbit service satellites that could<br>simply collect it capture it and<br>has enough propulsion to move on to the<br>next piece of space junk<br>and collect it there's a lot of people<br>working this problem<br>and there's a lot of different ways of<br>tackling it<br>so i i feel positive that there will be<br>a manageable system common system<br>to manage debris so<br>um yeah that's that's kind of the trends<br>and<br>rocket lab last i checked 104 satellites<br>were launched to date<br>um so uh well last time in march with uh<br>six small satellites sort of the toaster<br>kegerator size<br>and coming up soon i believe uh<br>auckland university engineering and<br>getting it in the act and they built a<br>satellite that<br>peter back is sponsoring to rideshare on<br>one of his launches<br>which is pretty exciting so new zealand<br>is getting in<br>so yes space we used to think of it as<br>star trek<br>as a final frontier now<br>space is a reality for us to visit<br>observe and protect<br>uh and uh rocket labs here the photo on<br>the left you see at one<br>uh mr uh shetland uh trying to fit into<br>one of the<br>uh electron rockets there uh captain<br>kirk sized<br>from star trek uh he actually came down<br>to auckland for one of the<br>electron launch rocket development<br>events<br>and um uh just was a<br>lovely ad to rocket labs for that event<br>so um that's pretty much what i had to<br>say<br>um i'm hoping that i haven't done too<br>badly on time<br>and uh um i wonder if we're ready for a<br>yes ann marie we are and i just want to<br>take a minute to<br>introduce professor craig roger and<br>thank you craig<br>for facilitating this piece of our<br>session today<br>craig was the was previously the head of<br>the department and is a professor of<br>physics<br>at otago and i guess craig you are you<br>are doctor weather<br>so you may get some questions about that<br>but thank you for hosting this section<br>of the session and i'll come back at the<br>end to wrap it up thank you<br>thank you very much jacinda um it did<br>craig roger here hopefully everybody can<br>can he can hear me uh i just want to<br>thank you anne marie for that<br>presentation<br>um of course ann marie and i are<br>actually more or less contemporaries<br>in terms of the physics department she<br>finished her phd in 1996 and i finished<br>my phd in 1997.<br>one of the things i find really<br>fascinating is that um<br>anne-marie was working in her phd period<br>in the uh laser research group and<br>historically otago's had this very<br>strong<br>laser physics quantum optics research<br>group<br>and still does today but<br>and i was in the space physics research<br>group and what we've now got is a<br>situation where she's gone<br>from one of our otago strengths into the<br>other one of our otago strengths moving<br>into the space environment so i mean<br>that's<br>that's a beautiful thing and um because<br>of<br>uh you know because a lot of otago<br>people once they leave the university<br>they never really leave<br>um uh when i was on sabbatical in<br>boulder in 2015 anne marie and her<br>husband and i went out for a really nice<br>beer and had a really good chat<br>about what that what what was what was<br>up and i i really you know i<br>i very much enjoyed that and when i was<br>head of department we've exchanged some<br>emails and things because<br>because these links don't stop right um<br>which is lovely<br>so yes as has been suggested i am a<br>space physics researcher myself<br>um mostly on the what what's the<br>environment out there like in terms of<br>what anne marie was talking about<br>actually the radiation belts the hot<br>particles trapped in the magnetic field<br>and how they coupled to the earth's<br>atmosphere and then more recently<br>um i've been interested in what we call<br>space weather<br>like jacinda was talking about i'm dr<br>weather<br>but it's the weather in space and how<br>the processes that are in space can<br>impact our human technology and um<br>internationally that's been a big deal<br>but as new as new zealand is becoming a<br>space faring nation<br>like anne marie said but as all of us<br>rely on space so much<br>as anne-marie talked about a lot you<br>know these phone things of ours<br>are talking to space all the time<br>and sometimes processes in space can<br>negatively affect space operations<br>whether it's causing<br>satellites to get cancer or have<br>alzheimer's or just<br>impact their ability to talk to the<br>ground and<br>some of these things are they're not<br>super common but they're also not<br>completely uncommon<br>and just like earthquake or tsunami<br>research we know that one day<br>there'll be an extreme event and just<br>like earthquake and tsunami research we<br>need to get ready for the stuff<br>so that we have plans and mitigation and<br>and with anne marie on the space<br>engineering and operations side<br>i know that this has been a big uh<br>thinking area for a long time in the<br>united states<br>but anyway i'm going on about me i know<br>there's some questions from<br>our audience uh for anne-marie and marie<br>the first one<br>is can you let us know whether being a<br>woman<br>made a difference to your career when<br>compared to your male counterparts<br>great question i saw it i typed a little<br>bit but<br>um you know i heard a great quote from<br>joanne mcguire who headed<br>up lockheed martin's space for a while<br>and she said most of<br>the challenge was right in here<br>um it can get you can spook yourself<br>a bit uh it's true many as a time i was<br>the only woman in the room in a meeting<br>but when you looked at the people they<br>were so kind accommodating interested in<br>what i had to say<br>i really wasn't um experiencing barriers<br>that that i might have dreamed up in my<br>head um<br>sometimes i had to pull all my my big<br>girl pens<br>uh and and argue for my ideas or or<br>to get a challenging new assignment<br>um but uh that was really up to me and<br>everyone needs to be able to do that<br>sometimes<br>so um yeah yeah<br>it's<br>um so uh i'm going to ask one more<br>question and then i'm going to uh<br>move over to a speaker who would like to<br>ask it in person um what do you think of<br>the idea of a space<br>shield to cool areas of the earth do you<br>think that could work<br>it's tricky because once you get one<br>sort of space shield up there<br>um you have to manage it just like any<br>satellite<br>i actually got the pleasure of meeting<br>someone who is doing some research on<br>this and a think tank and the hike just<br>behind my house here in golden colorado<br>um interested in particles that could<br>reflect<br>uh the sunlight back out and and reduce<br>the<br>the the radiation getting to the earth<br>thus cooling it<br>but once it's up there uh you want to<br>manage where is it<br>and uh is it over the right areas<br>uh and and then how does it dispose that<br>that final<br>you know end of life how do we manage<br>that if things got too cold<br>so um that that was an interesting idea<br>and people continue to pursue it because<br>it could<br>have a lot of pay dirt so uh stay tuned<br>to that idea<br>but the big technical challenge is<br>managing just where do you want to call<br>and how much<br>and geo engineering is quite<br>controversial because of that<br>downstream management aspect now um i<br>think it's either william or bill i'm<br>sorry i'm not sure which you wanted to<br>ask your question personally<br>yeah anne-marie uh god it must be at<br>least three decades ago if not longer<br>i remember seeing a map that was<br>produced from i think<br>csat that didn't last very long<br>yeah really uh yep but it was a map of<br>the topography of the<br>sea and it showed there were permanent<br>bulges in the sea<br>as you well know over the oceanic<br>trenches because of gravity deficiencies<br>and little depressions on the ocean<br>ocean surface over the mid-atlantic<br>ridge and um<br>and marine undersea volcanoes<br>it was a fantastic map i'm a geologist<br>by the way craig<br>uh question for you<br>have the altimeters in satellites uh are<br>they sufficiently refined today to be<br>able to track<br>tsunamis going across the oceans<br>track certain armies did you say<br>oh tsunamis actually speak of the double<br>bill<br>there is a recent article that showed a<br>satellite image<br>of an underwater wave that went through<br>a narrow point in indonesia<br>and they surmised that is the reason why<br>that submarine<br>uh went down and crashed into the ground<br>uh the underwater sea floor<br>um and when you see the image i think it<br>was from the himarari<br>satellite um you can that that there is<br>a sort of a circular wavefront because<br>some of that<br>underwater wave um transmitted to the<br>surface<br>um there's all sorts of means in terms<br>of um<br>you know rf frequency as well as a<br>visible of the surface<br>uh that is watching uh these elements<br>and techniques have only gotten more and<br>more sophisticated<br>in terms of how fast are things moving<br>the doppler shift and so on<br>i see craig nodding craig would you like<br>to add<br>i've certainly seen examples in the open<br>literature<br>of um of disturbances in the water<br>where for example there's a there's a<br>bright spot in the radar data i think<br>this is active radar<br>where you can see a ship and then you<br>can see the wake behind it<br>absolutely beautiful and and for example<br>waves moving through the straits of<br>gibraltar<br>where you can see waves expanding out on<br>both sides<br>and i actually do remember one beautiful<br>image where they pointed out that there<br>was<br>no spot at the front of this big wake<br>and um<br>i got told by the pis of that particular<br>spacecraft that they got in trouble for<br>releasing that<br>particular example because it was<br>probably a submarine that was actually<br>surfaced<br>uh underwater and um you know showing<br>that you can see such things is<br>is was somewhat problematic<br>it's a good point though because i i<br>don't think i have<br>seen an example of a tsunami wave<br>an actual tsunami um picked up on those<br>data sets<br>even though that should be a really big<br>coherent signal<br>to go look for uh whether it's a<br>question that there's just not so many<br>of them and you've got to be at the<br>right place at the right time which is<br>always an issue<br>i agree craig i think it's a what they<br>call a revisit rate<br>um and however there are small private<br>companies uh i think from europe who<br>are building um a constellation of low<br>earth<br>orbit satellites offer as a service<br>a photo every half hour of any spot<br>you you want so there's an element of<br>it's a huge amount of data<br>out there and it's just a matter of<br>when you can capture it and then using<br>data analytics and even<br>artificial intelligence to um digest it<br>and interpret it i'm sure you're right<br>it must be the revisit rate because when<br>you've got<br>the world and as anne-marie was talking<br>about with those low-earth orbiting<br>spacecraft that is zipping around quite<br>fast<br>they're zipping around fast but if they<br>don't look down at the same piece of<br>land very often which is why<br>as anne maria said you need a<br>constellation of lots and lots of<br>satellites and then at least something<br>should show up more<br>more regularly um<br>we have another question emery do people<br>working in your field talk about ufos<br>and if so in what context<br>they do in the sense of<br>um sometimes people<br>launch a satellite without telling<br>anyone<br>and uh um what an orbit analyst does<br>is say hey what's that and then it goes<br>through a bucket uh called a analyst<br>analysis<br>satellite and they work to figure out<br>based on its flight path<br>and other characteristics about it what<br>is it and where is it going<br>and then eventually when they figure<br>stuff out they tag it with its special<br>catalog number<br>uh and put it in the space catalog so in<br>some senses<br>we had to make it our business they're<br>moving so fast at thousands of<br>kilometers an hour to know what's going<br>on up there<br>and where it's going yeah really good<br>point and of course<br>um in the new zealand context now that<br>we're a space faring nation and we're<br>launching things<br>i know that before we started launching<br>from new zealand<br>there was a big effort inside the new<br>zealand government to set up the space<br>agency<br>but also to play by the international<br>rules and some of those things involved<br>new zealand having to sign up with<br>united nations organizations and various<br>other parts of the<br>space system so that we weren't just<br>chucking stuff<br>up there without anybody knowing it was<br>coming in any way shape or form<br>and um it becomes a matter of safety<br>it's like managing a freeway traffic<br>system<br>yeah exactly yeah i like how the<br>european space agency now has a whole<br>section that they call space<br>safety which is about various forms of<br>orbital management space weather debris<br>um oh here's another question who is<br>responsible for the space catalogue<br>uh i i think it is the space force and<br>my buddies at space command uh out of<br>the pentagon<br>um however uh i<br>i hear i look like a fancy american<br>actually<br>it's um it's a multinational effort<br>in fact in california they have this uh<br>organization called the combined space<br>operations center<br>and when i visited there i saw<br>folks from canada germany australia<br>not any kiwis i was upset but um<br>i did see uh it's it's now become a<br>multinational<br>joint effort united kingdom to<br>um share what we've learned about<br>watching space and space safety<br>and orbits and work together so we can<br>globally<br>shoulder the responsibility of space<br>safety<br>and in that context back to new zealand<br>there is a us company called leo lab<br>which now has a radar<br>in um in near nasby<br>you know in the lower south island which<br>is doing exactly that it's doing orbital<br>tracking for our part of the world<br>because the more information<br>that is available for those orbital<br>specialists that emery was talking about<br>the better<br>so another question anne-marie what do<br>you think will be the next<br>evolution in space<br>well i touched on it a little bit<br>obviously debris management and traffic<br>management<br>is big but i think in terms of a total<br>revolution<br>you know space is becoming so accessible<br>almost as a<br>source of data and a service um amazon<br>web services is offering us sort of a<br>collective<br>you want a ground station we'll set one<br>up for you here have a computer you<br>control your satellite from it<br>um so it becomes you don't have to be<br>the bigwig<br>who has to do everything the the launch<br>the building of the vehicle<br>the management of the vehicle the ground<br>station in fact<br>look at what we have in new zealand i<br>believe that uh rocket lab<br>is launching and the university of<br>auckland engineering team for about uh<br>three years is going to be controlling<br>the satellite and monitoring with<br>telemetry and tracking its orbit and its<br>health as it does its thing<br>so um it is becoming increasingly a<br>shared<br>effort it's not going to be so military<br>focused<br>um it's going to be a sort of a<br>centralization of<br>ground station services space data<br>collection<br>services and people will be able to<br>subscribe<br>and say i want to look at my house and i<br>want to do it every month of the year<br>and you know yeah 59.95 for their annual<br>subscription<br>it's a good example because yes i i<br>visited the university of auckland<br>um center where they're setting up this<br>mission control<br>space or this mission operations center<br>so just looking after those those the<br>satellites as they operate<br>and like all universities we're we're<br>we're in it<br>to train the young people who will then<br>move on and do this stuff in a<br>in a wider environment as well as do the<br>research so that perhaps it's done<br>better in the future but yeah<br>auckland has definitely started<br>investing in that in part because<br>they've got<br>um young engineering most not just<br>engineering students<br>a variety of physical sciences students<br>who are in the process of<br>designing and building cubesats they've<br>had a launch<br>i think it was dead on arrival but um<br>you know that's that's that's the nature<br>of cubesats too<br>uh faster better cheaper sometimes dead<br>right<br>so emery you're obviously watching the<br>um the possible re-entry of the<br>of the ton um<br>uh upper stage of chinese booster<br>um here's the problem with it<br>it's a rocket shell so it falls like a<br>leaf off of a tree<br>with a very complex orbit and people try<br>to study and characterize these sort of<br>um you know uh high surface area the<br>weight<br>uh objects remember uh for what's going<br>to happen in another couple of days<br>it's going to uh we're gonna keep a bead<br>on it<br>and then within a few hours we're gonna<br>know precisely where it's headed<br>and if it breaks up the debris itself<br>will continue to head<br>in the same direction so like to have<br>more warning<br>and and we all would have liked um uh<br>finance who have managed the disposal of<br>the royal stage<br>so that we got a little bit of a warm<br>fuzzy it wasn't gonna fall on something<br>valuable<br>so yeah yeah so if anybody's interested<br>there are multiple websites which have<br>updates from the professionals who are<br>tracking this and trying to predict the<br>arrival um from a new zealand context i<br>believe it's<br>it's due on mother's day on this coming<br>sunday<br>although with quite a big plus or minus<br>window it's about 20 hours that they're<br>not sure<br>yet because of that leaf on a tree um<br>aspect<br>but um it's an interesting thing to<br>watch<br>and disposal is hard as anne-marie said<br>well we've got to hope that it's heading<br>for the sea<br>um thank you that's i think that's a<br>a lovely segue and of course it could be<br>mother's day new zealand or mother's day<br>in the us<br>when when it does land so i guess we've<br>got broader coverage but<br>speaking of mother's day it's uh it's an<br>absolute pleasure and privilege to have<br>anne-marie's mother joining us i believe<br>from<br>my hometown of invercargill and<br>delighted you could join us<br>nina we're also delighted<br>that anne-marie and her husband mark are<br>wonderful donors and funders of two<br>scholarships for students and i believe<br>some of those students are on this call<br>it's a wonderful tribute to<br>anne-marie's love of the university that<br>she continues to<br>sponsor and support in this way as do a<br>number of other<br>of our advisory board members who are<br>also on this call<br>so i i want to thank everyone for<br>joining us<br>and marie this was fascinating craig<br>thank you i think between the two of you<br>you've<br>livened up all of our interests and<br>things to do with space<br>certainly a most entertaining and<br>interesting presentation<br>thank you all for joining us we will be<br>sending out<br>a follow-up to this so any questions<br>that we<br>didn't get right now we will include in<br>our follow-up note back to you<br>thank you for joining us and we hope<br>that you will<br>follow us online aua we have our own<br>website so anyone on this call who is in<br>the us<br>and you're not yet connected with us<br>please do<br>the best way to get connected with us is<br>to go to the university's<br>alumni association website join up there<br>it's free<br>and we will then know where to find you<br>if you have a u.s domiciled<br>address on this on the side<br>the last the last thing i want to say<br>just in closing anne-marie is uh you<br>were talking about the space force and i<br>i had the pleasure of doing a little bit<br>of associated work with that at the end<br>of last year<br>and i was really intrigued that they<br>call it spock<br>i thought spock was just very cool to<br>call the space<br>operations control i can't remember the<br>last letter now but<br>thank you for bringing all of this to<br>life for us and thank you to your<br>to your mother and your husband whom i<br>believe is also listening up<br>so have a good evening or rest of your<br>day everyone and thank you for joining<br>us<br>thank you jacinda and thank everyone for<br>joining<br>bye</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
