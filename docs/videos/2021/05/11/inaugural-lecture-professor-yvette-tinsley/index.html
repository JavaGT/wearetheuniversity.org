Terms such as partnership, transformative change, defunding, and prison abolition have entered the mainstream lexicon.

welcoming<br>good evening and thank you so much for<br>that lovely<br>introduction grant um and i have bought<br>along my water bottle this grant was<br>laughing at me as i was walking through<br>because i've decided um this is my home<br>this lecture theatre and<br>um so i'm just doing things as i<br>normally do then<br>normally would have a cup of tea as well<br>but i thought that might be taking<br>things a little bit too far<br>thank you to everyone for coming along<br>this evening<br>i've had quite a bad throat and our<br>faculty manager carol sorensen suggested<br>that maybe i could do the lecture<br>by way of interpretive dance tonight<br>you'll all be very relieved to know that<br>my voice is back<br>we don't need to do that you don't need<br>to see my rather groovy moves that i'd<br>come up with so it's often said that an<br>inaugural lecture<br>is a difficult beast and well it really<br>is i've learned that through trying to<br>write this one<br>but it's also a wonderful opportunity<br>for me to force my children to actually<br>sit<br>and listen while i go on about the<br>things that i'm passionate about because<br>normally they roll their eyes and walk<br>away<br>it's also lovely to see family<br>friends colleagues all of the above<br>sitting here in this lovely full room<br>and i do hope that i do justice to you<br>spending<br>your hour with me today<br>there are some notable absences tonight<br>my parents and sister are stuck in the<br>uk because of coverage<br>but the title of my talk pays a little<br>homage to my parents<br>and their tolerance when i was a<br>teenager<br>of writing probably usually angst ridden<br>song lyrics all over every square inch<br>and people who know me will not be<br>surprised by that and i can see that<br>there are some ex-students in the room<br>who have been subjected<br>to my post-punk new wave song list that<br>fit with criminal law and criminal<br>justice i am very sorry<br>for doing that to you i'm not going to<br>stop doing it though<br>so it's perhaps fitting that the title<br>of my lecture<br>is an adaptation of a song lyric that<br>evokes for me<br>the current failings of the criminal<br>justice process<br>the song by a group called tears for<br>fears and only the older people<br>will know who they are<br>was named after this particular<br>drawing henry moore's pale shelter scene<br>from 1941.<br>it's quite a bleak depiction of people<br>coming together to avoid harm<br>from enemy bombing having a pretty<br>miserable time while they're doing it<br>and we know that in the shelters there<br>was often overcrowding<br>illness harms that were committed by<br>fellow occupants<br>and that sounds familiar to me as an<br>experience of the criminal law<br>the song goes on to lament that instead<br>of love<br>they are given not only pale shelter but<br>also<br>cold hands in its attempt to be<br>objective and stand back from the<br>emotion of criminal cases<br>i think the criminal law most definitely<br>has<br>icy cold hands so tonight<br>i'm going to start by unpacking this<br>idea<br>of the criminal law and justice as a<br>pale shelter<br>looking at how it creates harm and<br>dehumanizes<br>while it adjudicates and punishes on the<br>behalf of the community<br>the ill effects of the criminal justice<br>process for victims and defendants<br>particularly for maori and pacific<br>peoples is well established in new<br>zealand<br>and legal reform efforts of obviously<br>and rightly<br>focused on victims and defendants<br>so i will start there but tonight i<br>don't want to spend<br>all of our time talking specifically<br>about the harms calls to defendants and<br>complainants by the criminal process<br>they are well documented and understood<br>for the most part<br>instead i'm going to spend some time<br>illustrating that the harms of the<br>criminal process<br>reach everyone involved there's a<br>growing body of research<br>including a project i've just begun with<br>nicola tyler from the school of<br>psychology<br>that shows the harmful emotional impacts<br>on both lay people<br>and criminal justice professionals<br>then having highlighted some of the ways<br>in which the criminal process causes<br>more harm<br>by attempting to be unemotional i'll say<br>a little about why i think<br>we haven't properly addressed or even<br>recognized some of the problems<br>in the criminal justice process while we<br>have a number of<br>high-level recommendations from recent<br>reports<br>i'll talk about the fact that we're<br>stuck in this particular kind of<br>approach to criminal law reform<br>and that that reform is largely siloed<br>from other<br>matters of social justice it's therefore<br>unsurprising to me that we've made<br>little progress<br>in addressing the problems in the<br>criminal process<br>then finally i'll move to the hard part<br>i'll finish off by talking about what i<br>see as some<br>viable steps towards making a change<br>how can we build on some of these<br>initiatives that have already begun<br>how do we warm up those cold hands of<br>the criminal law<br>make the process a proper shelter where<br>people can trust that harms will be<br>responded to<br>safely<br>now criminal law is about people's<br>stories<br>it's about their histories so i'll start<br>by sharing<br>what motivates me and the kids have to<br>stay there while i do it and i'll also<br>share with you one of my own stories<br>now most of my formative years were in<br>the uk in the thatcher era<br>i lived in a mining village and during<br>the minor strike in the mid 80s<br>i saw the impact of police misuse of<br>power<br>on the picket lines later when i was a<br>student<br>i protested my right to party there was<br>an actual rally it's not just a beastie<br>boys song<br>i experienced some of the special police<br>treatment myself<br>when i think about my research life<br>seemingly disparate projects i've worked<br>on<br>from eyewitness identification sexual<br>violence reform evidence law reform<br>jurors sentencing<br>they can all be linked by a motivation<br>to improve the experience that people<br>have<br>that stems back to the unfairness that i<br>saw<br>when i was young those early experiences<br>sowed the seeds for the research i do<br>and the questions i want to ask and<br>ultimately<br>my ideas about reform of the criminal<br>justice process<br>i've been lucky enough to be involved in<br>some projects that have led to<br>legislative reform<br>but i've learned that policy and<br>practice change are just as<br>and sometimes more influential<br>i am a socio-legal researcher it's like<br>i'm a<br>socio-legal research anonymous here<br>it's a term that isn't very easy to<br>define because people view it in<br>different<br>but ways its most basic what it means is<br>i take a multi<br>or interdisciplinary approach to the<br>study of legal phenomena<br>using both theoretical and empirical<br>methods<br>for legal academics like me then<br>theoretical<br>perspectives and methodologies are<br>informed by research undertaken in<br>disciplines<br>outside law as well as by traditional<br>legal research<br>and theory of all branches of law<br>the criminal law is where the power of<br>the state<br>is the most visible ultimately<br>decision making in the criminal justice<br>process can deprive people of their<br>liberty<br>the criminal justice process causes harm<br>while it's responding to harm<br>i'm not referring here to harm in the<br>very strict<br>definition of violation of a person's<br>interest as is required for<br>criminalization<br>but more in a general sense of physical<br>or psychological harm<br>for me the idea of criminal justice is<br>something<br>harmful that was experienced<br>as something that happens to people<br>something that's intensely personal<br>and emotional started even before the<br>minor strike<br>and those rallies to preserve my ability<br>to attend raves<br>it started with family stories<br>about the 1930s kidnapping and murder of<br>my grandfather's cousin<br>mona there she is she was 10 years old<br>when she was kidnapped and killed<br>the stories that we heard in the family<br>focused on the family's frantic search<br>for mona<br>and subsequently for her body over<br>days and weeks and months<br>and here are some local women about<br>three weeks after she disappeared<br>searching<br>in the gully that sense of loss and<br>panic was what came through those<br>stories<br>the momentous impacts it had on extended<br>branches<br>and future generations of our family<br>later on i read mona's case<br>i read about about it through several<br>books<br>articles often it was that 1960s style<br>of reporting on true crime<br>the case was notorious<br>it was important because it was one of<br>the last nobody no murder cases<br>and it went to two trials one for<br>kidnapping<br>before they found her body and then<br>another for murder<br>after they had found it in this river<br>but because to me the case was personal<br>what affected me most was the suspicion<br>cast on mona's family the blame<br>pays placed on her parents for being<br>ineffectual<br>essentially because they were poor and<br>uneducated<br>that to me was a message about the<br>criminal law<br>that went beyond the intellectual and<br>legal aspects of the case<br>even though they fascinated me later it<br>was the human element<br>the emotion the ongoing<br>intergenerational pain<br>that resonated first public interest was<br>prurient<br>in the case nobody a psychic medium<br>employed in the search<br>tales of infidelity police and the<br>courts were distant and aloof<br>for mona's family official them that<br>unemotionally handled<br>a part of their profound grief the<br>criminal law in its agents<br>had cold hands indeed<br>it's too easy to forget that people<br>involved in a criminal case<br>are more than that moment of offending<br>my family were more than that moment<br>people come into the criminal process<br>with complete life histories<br>full stories and as i look at the<br>criminal justice process today<br>their treatment is not much better than<br>my family suffered<br>at the time of mona's disappearance<br>those living in poverty are still more<br>likely to be offenders<br>more likely to be victims more likely to<br>be blamed for what happens to them<br>in new zealand because of a colonial<br>taking of political power<br>they are also more likely to be maori<br>it's apparent then that the criminal<br>justice process<br>much criminal justice research<br>understandably focuses<br>on the inequities of the criminal<br>process as i've just described<br>for suspects defendants and offenders<br>new zealand has an adversarial criminal<br>justice process<br>whereby parties put forward competing<br>narratives<br>about what the truth is and the<br>prosecution<br>must prove the case against the<br>defendant beyond reasonable doubt<br>and that's a term that continues to<br>confuse law students and juries alike<br>unlike civil law jurisdictions such as<br>those in continental europe<br>the parties decide what witnesses to<br>call the judge<br>acts as an impartial referee<br>while the trial is touted as this<br>ultimate focal point in our system<br>in reality most criminal offences don't<br>go to a defender trial<br>much less a jury trial most defendants<br>are dealt with<br>in a way that's much more perfunctory<br>than popular culture would have us<br>believe<br>along the way there are incentives to<br>plead guilty<br>both explicit through things like a<br>guilty plea discount<br>and implicit so for minor offending it<br>can seem<br>easier to plead guilty to get it over<br>with<br>getting it over with is an<br>understandable aim<br>when to use malcolm feely's famous<br>phrase the process<br>is the punishment the phrase denotes the<br>problem<br>that from the very first connection<br>with the criminal process defendants<br>lives are impacted<br>employment can be affected relationships<br>reputation and so on often before<br>adjudication takes place<br>by way of a guilty plea or defender<br>trial<br>after that that we are punitive in new<br>zealand<br>our imprisonment rate is on the latest<br>figures<br>approximately 170 per 100 000<br>of the general population so that's<br>improved<br>from five years ago but it still puts us<br>in the top 10 in the oecd<br>and that is not a list we want to be<br>as a point of reference england and<br>wales sits around 135<br>per 100 000 most of the nordic countries<br>are around per 100 000<br>our remand population so that's the<br>prisoners who have not yet been tried<br>not yet been found guilty<br>is 62 per 100 000<br>population we imprison people who have<br>not yet<br>been convicted at a higher rate<br>than some countries in prison full stop<br>so feely's idea of the process being the<br>punishment still rings true in modern<br>day<br>new zealand it's now well known<br>and accepted that maori suffer these ill<br>effects<br>of the criminal justice process more<br>than any other group<br>in new zealand they are over-represented<br>in criminal statistics from arrest<br>through imprisonment and including<br>remand<br>in custody the harms are undeniable<br>just under 17 of the general population<br>omari<br>but approximately 52 of the prison<br>population<br>the impacts of colonization the loss of<br>maori political power<br>are very much present in our criminal<br>justice process today<br>harms to whanau continue despite<br>so the criminal process undeniably<br>harmful<br>to defendants and my own early<br>motivations<br>interests and reform plans resolved<br>revolt solely<br>about addressing those harms that i saw<br>to suspects<br>defendants and offenders suffering<br>because we're in this process that<br>doesn't work properly<br>but then i had an experience as a<br>survivor of crime<br>a violent crime when i was a<br>postgraduate student<br>and that made me broaden my scope a<br>little bit<br>nothing like a good bit of personal<br>experience to make you think hard<br>so it was a very good life and research<br>lesson for me<br>in the harms that the criminal process<br>inflicts on victims of crime<br>so at the time i was doing some<br>part-time work in defence<br>i knew the process i thought<br>i was pretty confident everything was<br>going to be<br>okay and i knew what was going to happen<br>i was not kept well informed by police<br>or the prosecution i was shocked on the<br>day of the trial<br>to find out that charges had been<br>amended in order to bargain a guilty<br>plea<br>and even though i expected it i did get<br>upset later<br>that i had to hear please in sentencing<br>submissions that were distortions of the<br>truth<br>with no way for me to respond<br>even knowing the system as i did working<br>for the defense knowing prosecutors<br>i wasn't expecting to feel quite so much<br>of an<br>outsider to proceedings about harm that<br>had happened<br>to me my experience was<br>over 25 years ago in the uk<br>but it doesn't take much to look around<br>in new zealand<br>to see that the experience of victims<br>today is still poor<br>victims put trust in the criminal<br>justice process<br>and the people working within it but<br>within an adversarial process<br>victims are not parties to the offence<br>while there's a common perception that<br>our criminal justice process is highly<br>individualized<br>and it's true that we have a focus on<br>protecting individual rights<br>a criminal prosecution is ultimately a<br>communal process<br>in the sense that the state represents<br>the community it doesn't represent<br>an individual so that's<br>intended to relieve victims of the<br>burden of bringing actions<br>for harms committed against them but its<br>result<br>is as the legal scholar andrew ashworth<br>famously said as far as the adversarial<br>system is concerned<br>the victim's interest is surely no<br>greater<br>than yours or mine and that's what i<br>felt<br>when i went through the system myself<br>meanwhile<br>communities that suffer other forms of<br>social injustice<br>are over-represented as victims and as<br>repeat victims<br>maori in particular are over-represented<br>as victims of violent offending<br>reporting rates for violent crime<br>particularly of sexual violence<br>are low fear of crime<br>is high reforms to victims rights<br>legislation has tended to merely pay lip<br>service<br>while making little appreciable<br>difference to the actual experience of<br>victims<br>in the process and that's because the<br>process<br>is not designed to give victims a<br>greater role<br>this has all been exacerbated by the<br>tendency to cast victims and offenders<br>as two disparate groups<br>yet not only do victims and offenders<br>both come from our community<br>they are often the same people if ever a<br>shelter was pale<br>it's the one provided to victims of<br>crime<br>now while the harms caused to defendants<br>and complainants by the process<br>are well researched and i've just given<br>you a<br>very quick snapshot my argument is that<br>the harms inflicted<br>by the way we do justice go well beyond<br>we know that the effects of the criminal<br>process itself<br>as well as offending behavior ripple out<br>to whanau and beyond<br>as it did for my family in mona's case<br>but what's less well documented is the<br>impact of the process on<br>other actors within the criminal process<br>while most research focuses on the<br>dehumanizing effects for victims and<br>defendants<br>there is nonetheless a growing<br>international body of research<br>that shows both positive and negative<br>emotional impacts for<br>others in the process including judges<br>lawyers police and other criminal<br>justice professionals<br>and i want to briefly illustrate that by<br>looking at two groups<br>and these are the groups where<br>coincidentally not<br>so i'm going to share with you this<br>evening some of the things that jurors<br>and prosecutors<br>have said to us when we've been<br>conducting the research<br>so in terms of jurors there's very<br>little research internationally<br>on the impacts of criminal justice on<br>jurors<br>we're one of the few countries in the<br>world that has had large-scale<br>qualitative studies with jurors in real<br>trials<br>and i've been privileged to be involved<br>in the two largest of those studies when<br>i first came to new zealand<br>i was warned by my phd supervisor<br>professor john baldwin<br>that i was coming to a wasteland i said<br>it quite like that<br>for criminal justice scholars because<br>i was very fortunate when i arrived that<br>warren young who's here tonight<br>and neil cameron who unfortunately can't<br>be um we're here at the law faculty<br>of victoria i feel lucky to have come to<br>a place where applied criminal justice<br>research was taking place in the law<br>school<br>where it was revealed to me there was<br>indeed crime<br>and of course there was lots being done<br>by colleagues such as professor jan<br>jordan<br>and others at the institute of<br>criminology too without warren<br>and neil it would have been really<br>difficult for me<br>to follow my passion of socio-legal<br>empirical research on any large scale<br>i learned so much working with them on<br>the first new zealand jury study<br>and i do confess this is<br>not very nice of me but i had a little<br>bit of glee<br>when professor baldwin who was a juris<br>researcher<br>ended up being very jealous that i was<br>able to conduct<br>research that was prohibited in england<br>and wales<br>not such a wasteland after all john<br>now many engineers enjoy the experience<br>of being on a jury<br>but a significant minority are<br>emotionally impacted<br>in ways that disturb their well-being<br>family life<br>and work what we've been told by jurors<br>illustrates that the harms caused by the<br>criminal justice process<br>are not confined to victims and<br>defendants some of the emotional harm<br>is unavoidable just by the nature of the<br>evidence<br>but how we respond to that and the<br>extent to which<br>it has to be disruptive of jurors lives<br>is<br>something the criminal justice process<br>can do something about<br>now i don't obviously don't have much<br>time this evening and you all want to<br>get to the drinks<br>so i'm just going to give a brief<br>snapshot of three aspects<br>so first of all many jurors even those<br>who are positive about the experience<br>talked about how draining and<br>emotionally tiring the process<br>is and reported times of emotional<br>release<br>so one said you almost feel like a<br>victim<br>it was really stressful intense and<br>scary<br>i couldn't stop thinking about it and<br>because you are instructed not to talk<br>to anyone about it<br>you can't deal with it it's<br>quite an emotional thing coming out on<br>the friday<br>when we had finished i met my wife at<br>the pub and when i was waiting for her<br>i was shaking and this next one<br>um<br>is about um people suffering pretty much<br>sleepless nights during and after the<br>trial<br>and those effects lasting well long<br>after the trial their inability to let<br>it go<br>causing lots of stress in their<br>relationships and this one said i had an<br>argument with my partner the first night<br>because he thought i was ridiculously<br>upset<br>he couldn't understand it at all and the<br>following day i found out most of the<br>women went home<br>and burst into tears<br>upset and distress is often more acutely<br>felt as you would expect<br>in violence and criminal and sexual<br>violence trials<br>but it can also manifest in other types<br>of case particularly longer trials and<br>we had a few fraud cases for example<br>where people said look i made<br>connections with these people over the<br>course of six weeks<br>and then you just say thanks very much<br>see you your as the juror said<br>just thrown out at the end<br>jurors not only find the evidence itself<br>upsetting<br>but also the stress of deliberations<br>dealing with their fellow jurors<br>12 people shove together in a pokey<br>little room<br>things are not always going to go well<br>some jurors<br>when talking to us cried during their<br>interview recalling exchanges with other<br>jurors<br>and the level of tension in the jury<br>room<br>that tension relates to a second aspect<br>of emotional harm and stress jurors can<br>become distressed by the pressure to<br>reach<br>a correct verdict and the impact of<br>their decision<br>on the lives of defendants complainants<br>so the first one there said all of a<br>sudden i thought when i was sitting in<br>the jury box<br>i had to decide someone's fate i didn't<br>know how overwhelming that would be<br>i never want to go through it again i<br>never want to have it on my shoulders<br>to put a guy away we were all in tears<br>i was physically ill and this last one<br>was from a murder case<br>we got back into the jury room after the<br>judge handed down the life sentence and<br>12 people<br>there was just not one word just dead<br>silence<br>a couple of women cried i cried when i<br>got home<br>i drove a meldura home and he had a cry<br>on the way home<br>pressures about the verdict are<br>exacerbated when members of the jury<br>are affected by evidence because of what<br>they or someone close<br>has experienced and our studies suggest<br>this is most likely to happen<br>in sexual violence trials as well as the<br>personal impact<br>on individual jurors which is profound<br>in a small minority cases it can be<br>disruptive of juror decision making as<br>in this case which has stuck with me<br>this is from my first study and it is<br>maureen's nodding his head<br>it sticks with you so much imagining<br>what that was like in that jury room for<br>most of the time she did not sit at the<br>table with other jurors<br>and at one stage she curled up in the<br>now so far i've looked at the harmful<br>impacts of the criminal process<br>on lay people there's a growing body of<br>research as i said at the start of this<br>talk about the impacts of emotional<br>labor<br>and vicarious trauma on the well-being<br>of those working<br>within the criminal justice process<br>there's very little new zealand<br>scholarship about it though<br>so we're quite excited about this study<br>aren't we nicola<br>which in the first phase examines<br>prosecutors and defense counsel's<br>experiences so thanks to nicola and also<br>to rachel<br>who conducted interviews with<br>prosecutors for her master's thesis<br>research<br>for agreeing to let me share some of<br>these quotes with you<br>the data is extremely rich so again i'm<br>just going to share a small taster with<br>you<br>so first almost all of the prosecutors<br>we spoke to<br>told us that they felt the need to<br>switch off their emotions<br>when asked the question do you feel that<br>there are certain emotions you're<br>expected to perform<br>as a crown prosecutor one prosecutor<br>said<br>hmm if detachment is an emotion<br>i feel more often my job calls on me to<br>hold something back<br>that i naturally feel<br>another said you can't be emotive as a<br>prosecutor you can't cry<br>you can't get angry you have to be<br>completely lacking an emotion<br>which i don't know i guess it's an<br>emotion but devoid of emotion<br>secondly this need to work without being<br>impacted emotionally<br>fed into a sense that to feel emotion<br>or to admit to needing support was weak<br>or it showed they were not up to the job<br>this understandably seemed to impact on<br>junior prosecutors<br>the most they were the ones most fearful<br>about what would happen<br>to their career so one of them said to<br>us some of the older partners can't see<br>why we're not tough enough<br>and there was talk of aspiring to be<br>like the senior partners who all seemed<br>to bounce off of and they didn't get<br>emotional at all about all of these<br>horrific things they were doing<br>see you and then another said i felt all<br>the weight of my bosses telling me and<br>my colleague<br>it shouldn't matter to you that much<br>don't let me get to you<br>just don't let it get to you so as you<br>can start to see from those quotes<br>it appears that the culture of firms and<br>the profession more generally<br>help to create the feeling that to have<br>career advancement<br>you should not show your weaknesses<br>so occupational culture is related to<br>these fears<br>about career advancement and one<br>prosecutor<br>and we also talked to the person<br>involved who confirmed this<br>it was suggested to one of my co-workers<br>the best way to get over her three rape<br>trials in a row<br>was to have a stiff glass of wine which<br>i think wasn't what she needed to hear<br>at that time<br>and that does feed into a coping<br>mechanism of excessive drinking<br>and then this next person there's very<br>much an expectation<br>you'll just get on with it you can't be<br>weak or fallible<br>i don't think you would have bounced<br>professionally in the firm if you were<br>to admit to being damaged<br>i mean it's okay to joke about it<br>but not to seriously admit to the effect<br>the material has on you<br>it's implicit in that no one's ever said<br>don't ever tell us if you have a problem<br>but<br>there's a lot of taking the piss out of<br>anyone that does admit to being<br>vulnerable<br>so it's very clear you wouldn't do that<br>and still be held in high regard and<br>when we probed a bit further<br>the people taking the piss were the<br>partners<br>okay so it wasn't just kind of fellow<br>on the same level as those juniors<br>there was very low enthusiasm amongst<br>the prosecutors we've spoken to so far<br>for eap processes or the law society<br>advice lines<br>they reported that they would rather see<br>someone else<br>some firms had put in place some<br>mechanisms<br>but prosecutors reported to us that<br>there were barriers to confidentially<br>accessing<br>sorry the constant having to push said<br>one<br>was wearing me down i'd rather go and<br>pay for it myself than have to keep<br>going and filling in all these forms and<br>begging if you made a decision if you<br>made a decision<br>and then another said there's a new<br>service but it's not encouraged it's<br>certainly not encouraged<br>they started offering clinical<br>psychologists that you can go to<br>but it's been described as the last<br>cabin the rank kind of service<br>we should be front footing these issues<br>because a lot of the things i've said to<br>you now<br>i know saying it out loud that's not<br>right and i shouldn't be thinking like<br>that<br>and i know a lot of people would be<br>horrified if they found out the<br>prosecutor<br>and then thirdly the role impacts on<br>prosecutors well-being<br>the process and how they work within it<br>impacts on their well-being it leads<br>those coping mechanisms like excessive<br>drinking lots of use of dark humor<br>and as i read through our data on this<br>when i was preparing<br>for this lecture it reminded me very<br>much of things i'd read many years ago<br>about<br>police in the uk and the things they<br>said about their role<br>i feel like i'll never be able to be<br>just a normal person<br>after reading all this stuff you just<br>can't you cannot<br>so much stress you can't eat properly<br>you can't sleep properly<br>it's a bit of a nightmare if i'm honest<br>and then another said you're exposed to<br>a lot of trauma<br>and you just kind of push it aside until<br>it becomes too much<br>and you can't cope<br>and for those who can't cope what we got<br>were reports that people were just<br>crying in the bathrooms being very upset<br>in a closed office those kinds of things<br>now this included impact on their<br>relationships and this is<br>so this is not just about their working<br>environment their working life<br>it's impacting on their relationships<br>with people outside of the office<br>prosecuting sexual violence affects my<br>life<br>if i'm in trial or the lead up to a<br>trial my job is to vividly paint a<br>picture of sexual violence<br>my head is busy trying to recreate a<br>picture of sexual violence<br>and it's stewing over that in my<br>subconscious and there is<br>no way i found to be physically intimate<br>with my partner<br>i just don't want my husband i don't<br>want to be halfway through having sex<br>and suddenly my mind<br>draw up the image from 2pm today of<br>now it goes further that it affects<br>every part<br>of these prosecutors lives in the way<br>that they<br>look to the rest of society and they<br>look<br>and think about human nature creating<br>this general<br>kind of sense of suspicion and almost<br>paranoia<br>so one prosecutor was talking about when<br>they were on holiday at a campsite<br>and this was the internal track going<br>through their mind<br>do you think those girls are safe with<br>their dad why are they just with their<br>dad<br>where's their mum what could be<br>happening in that tent right now<br>when i've woken up in the night i<br>thought is there someone in the house<br>could someone come in the house there<br>could be someone going to do a burglary<br>there could be someone coming in to look<br>for a woman to rape<br>it's a fear or an anxiety that i never<br>and that next one this sort of like<br>simple innocence is gone i think that's<br>a<br>wonderful way to put it that this<br>innocence has been taken away because of<br>their work in the criminal process<br>they said so like before you know i used<br>to drive past campgrounds at the beach<br>or people camping at the beach and think<br>oh great<br>these people are having a nice holiday<br>and now i drive past the campground and<br>i think<br>there's definitely going to be at least<br>10 kids getting molested in there<br>and the people who are committing the<br>offending there's no way to know what<br>they look like<br>and no way to know who you should be<br>suspicious of and not<br>so you just end up being suspicious of<br>everybody<br>unfortunately now i should make it clear<br>i'm not suggesting that we could or<br>should attempt to make<br>this vicarious trauma and emotional<br>labor<br>of working in the criminal justice<br>process magically go away<br>the point is that we're not addressing<br>it in healthy ways<br>and therefore the process is more<br>harmful than it needs to be<br>the problems that these prosecutors have<br>identified<br>are mainly ones of harms caused by the<br>suppression<br>of emotional response working in the<br>criminal process<br>will always expose people to vicarious<br>trauma<br>and require emotional labor but that<br>doesn't have to be<br>unrelentingly harmful and negative in<br>the way these prosecutors describe it<br>acknowledging emotional impacts<br>supporting people to get help for<br>example<br>through professional supervision as has<br>been suggested in the profession<br>can actually lead to positive impacts<br>psychological research shows<br>that there are possible positive outlets<br>for emotional labor<br>and that if harnessed it can sometimes<br>help people to do their jobs well<br>so what these examples of the harmful<br>impacts of the criminal justice process<br>illustrate<br>is a form of dehumanization a disconnect<br>between the law the human beings that<br>inhabit the criminal justice process<br>and wider society in turn<br>it suggests that while important changes<br>to the law alone will not fix the<br>failings of the system<br>in the early 1990s i was studying at<br>birmingham law school<br>and it was perhaps at the time the best<br>place to be for someone interested in<br>criminal justice<br>because the birmingham school was this<br>powerhouse of empirical<br>socio-legal and critical criminal<br>justice research<br>um the birmingham six famous famously<br>were<br>had their conviction quashed at the time<br>i was there it was the site of fruitful<br>police research and<br>that was something i benefited from when<br>i did my phd research across several<br>police stations in the west midlands<br>now while i was an undergraduate<br>birmingham and x birmingham scholars<br>mcconville<br>sanders and leng produced the landmark<br>book case for the prosecution<br>which illustrated that police<br>discretionary decision-making<br>had not been fettered by legislative<br>changes to police powers<br>roger lange one of the authors of the<br>book was my criminal law lecturer at the<br>time of its publication<br>and he later became a mentor and friend<br>and seeing his passion<br>close up was really inspiring now one of<br>the mainstays of the book<br>is the critique of what it turns the<br>legal reform model<br>while focused on police powers i'd argue<br>that the critique has more<br>general applicability mcconnell sanders<br>and leng<br>describe the seductive and<br>understandable response<br>of trying to amend legal rules to<br>protect individual defendants<br>and increase the role of victims and<br>they say to advocate reform of this kind<br>implies that social actors are<br>responsive to changes in legal rules<br>and that the response is that which is<br>contemplated by the advocate of reform<br>so in other words<br>successful legislative reform requires<br>that the new law<br>does what it was intended and that<br>people using it or governed<br>by it changed their behavior accordingly<br>now while mcconnell sanders and lang<br>found that changes in legal rules had<br>some<br>impact on the behaviour of actors within<br>the criminal justice process<br>the changes often instead produced<br>adaptive behavior<br>that undermine the intentions of the<br>reform<br>we can't rely on the law alone as a<br>protective device<br>otherwise we will slip say the authors<br>into a treadmill of permanent law reform<br>in which every failing of the law to<br>deal with certain social behaviors<br>is addressed by a reformulation of the<br>rules and that may sound familiar<br>to any of you who have been involved in<br>now time and criminal justice have moved<br>on<br>but case for the prosecution and<br>particularly that critique of the<br>effectiveness of reform of the law<br>itself<br>remains relevant i posit in two ways<br>first if legal scholarship and reform<br>only looks to legislative amendment or<br>legal reasoning about a set of<br>established legal norms<br>we may silo those reforms and the<br>process as a whole<br>resulting in what has been called law<br>without society<br>rule changes need to be mindful of<br>cultural work practices<br>we know that cultural norms in police<br>and the legal profession<br>are not altered easily<br>criminal justice can and should fix<br>things that are within its own house<br>but the problems of criminal justice are<br>related to the problems of society<br>as a whole that means that even reforms<br>that attend to criminal justice practice<br>rather than legal rules need a broader<br>frame in order to be able to have<br>optimum effect we cannot make criminal<br>justice<br>better without also attending to social<br>deprivation<br>which both drives and is fed by criminal<br>justice outcomes<br>the legal reform model does not<br>adequately address inequities and bias<br>as reform recommendations coming from<br>the safe and effective justice who is an<br>advisory suggests<br>we need to both think about what we mean<br>by law and also be prepared to look<br>beyond it<br>for ways to make the process better<br>secondly the case of the prosecution<br>remains valid<br>because just as in the 1990s in britain<br>new zealand's current criminal justice<br>process<br>is a place where policy and practice are<br>quasi-legal beasts<br>in our criminal process discretionary<br>decision making is common<br>and is necessary but even putting aside<br>the problems<br>with working out how much discretion is<br>required that's a lecture on its own<br>it can leave the criminal process quite<br>vulnerable<br>so for example police adult diversion is<br>a policy<br>that could be withdrawn by police if<br>they wanted to even though that would<br>have significant impact<br>for the running of the courts now one<br>might argue<br>that those policies should all be given<br>a legislative base<br>but the limitations of the legal reform<br>model would remain because discretion<br>will still be needed<br>and discretion is notoriously resistant<br>to changes in the law itself<br>so a good example in new zealand of this<br>is sexual violence reform<br>incremental reform of evidential rules<br>and to<br>a lesser degree the substantive law have<br>been a feature of the last<br>30 odd years we've instituted a lot of<br>worthwhile reforms<br>many of them have had impacts we've<br>allowed complainancy governance in<br>alternative ways provided for support<br>people<br>controls on questioning particularly<br>regarding a<br>complainant's previous sexual experience<br>with revised for gender neutrality<br>in the language of the statute and so on<br>but despite that multitude of reforms<br>and despite the positive effects of them<br>reporting rates remain low<br>prosecution rates remain low and<br>conviction rates<br>remain low complainants continue to find<br>the process punishing<br>and rate myths are still prevalent in<br>court<br>we're reaching the end of the road in<br>how much more we can tinker<br>with the evidential rules and without<br>major disruption to basic principles<br>how much we can alter the substantive<br>law the legal reform model has not<br>worked<br>because just as mcconnell sanders and<br>lang identified back in the 90s<br>reform to the law itself could only do<br>so much<br>without change to underlying culture and<br>society<br>so let's try to get warm<br>so i feel that i may have got you all<br>feeling quite depressed<br>quite despondent<br>it's not an unusual or uncommon response<br>i've argued the criminal justice process<br>is harmful to everyone within it<br>traditional legal reform is necessary<br>but not sufficient<br>so do we throw up our hands in despair<br>do i think<br>as i had a flash of it as i was writing<br>this have i wasted my time all these<br>years<br>we can't afford to do that and in fact<br>what we know about harm's caused by the<br>process and the limitations of the legal<br>reform model<br>can start to illuminate some avenues of<br>potential change and i'm going to<br>mention three<br>i've got to think about three in this<br>lecture i don't it wasn't intentional<br>the first one is one i've been an<br>advocate of using in sexual violence<br>cases for a decade now<br>but there's no reason why it should be<br>restricted to that type of case<br>many of the harms we see come from the<br>nature and operation<br>of the adversarial process our modern<br>criminal justice process is young<br>we need to have some of what lucia<br>zedner calls gentle<br>eye opening if we try to open our eyes<br>to other ways of doing things<br>we might see that there's no magic to<br>the adversarial trial<br>it's not a necessary given certainly not<br>for all cases<br>so my argument is we should look to<br>alternative processes<br>what we need is a suite of options the<br>defender trial is only one of those<br>options<br>now that would work especially well for<br>cases where we don't have enough<br>evidence to bring a prosecution<br>or where there's sufficient evidence to<br>prosecute but the prosecution is<br>unlikely to achieve an outcome that<br>addresses the needs of the victim<br>or be in the public interest in those<br>types of case right now<br>harm often goes unaccounted for because<br>the criminal process<br>fails to achieve any kind of redress for<br>that harm<br>so within this suite of options broadly<br>restorative therapeutic and educative<br>approaches could operate<br>that might be within the criminal<br>justice process and even within the<br>courts<br>such as the tia marimo initiative that<br>would see among other things<br>community services on hand for advice<br>and support<br>but the different approaches might also<br>operate outside of the formal criminal<br>justice process<br>or as diversion from it these could<br>include<br>a community problem solving approach<br>that would go<br>further than the current tiparanga ewe<br>community panels<br>i'm talking here about something that<br>would have support and programmes<br>on hand not only for defendants but for<br>victims and perhaps for families<br>the provision of educational programs<br>relevant to the offender a treatment<br>response<br>for the offender that sits outside of<br>the criminal process<br>so that we're not as as we tend to do in<br>problem-solving or solution-based courts<br>holding on until sentencing and forcing<br>treatment<br>during that phase a restorative justice<br>type response<br>that would involve a direct or indirect<br>mechanism for the victim<br>to present to the offender the<br>consequences of their conduct<br>and for the offender to acknowledge<br>their wrongdoing and offer redress<br>now these types of reform would help to<br>locate criminal justice<br>within the broader social justice needs<br>of offenders victims and communities<br>it would also allow for communities to<br>have ownership<br>of responses to harm that could go some<br>way to avoid the problem we often see<br>of co-option of maori knowledge<br>experience and political power<br>when we devise new programmes in the<br>criminal process<br>secondly real effort<br>anyone from the government here real<br>effort should be made to translate those<br>high level recommendations that we've<br>seen<br>for transformative change into<br>meaningful options<br>for the individual parts of the criminal<br>process<br>as well as looking at the whole now<br>that's a really hard job<br>but somebody needs to attempt to see<br>what would these reforms look like<br>for different stages of the process in<br>its niggly itty-bitty detail<br>otherwise we're going to continue for<br>another 30 years without any meaningful<br>change<br>that kind of effort should show respect<br>for indigenous knowledge<br>by empowering maori and other<br>communities rather than taking place<br>solely within<br>existing policy frameworks<br>and thirdly the cases where we must go<br>to trial<br>we need to more openly acknowledge the<br>positive role for emotion<br>law and language research has shown that<br>emotion is not the antithesis of reason<br>as lawyers would often have you believe<br>in fact rather than being the enemies of<br>reason<br>emotions have positively influenced the<br>development of legal reasoning<br>practice and scholarship neuroscience<br>suggests it's impossible to separate<br>emotion from reason<br>and we shouldn't try to emotional labor<br>does not have to be negative emotions<br>matter<br>for justice now recognizing that valid<br>role of emotions in decision making<br>could assist in the courtroom so<br>thinking back to those quotes<br>from jurors we could give jurors<br>better emotional as well as factual<br>preparation<br>we could have greater emphasis on the<br>benefits of counselling<br>not just an offer of counselling but a<br>positive encouragement or expectation<br>and we could give them preparation for<br>the difficulties encountered<br>when undertaking the responsibility of<br>being asked to judge other people's<br>lives<br>and we could also give them more<br>education about group decision making<br>some of the stress and pressure jurors<br>endure as well as inefficiency and<br>deliberations<br>could be ameliorated if jurors had help<br>with how to go about making a decision<br>now we've found in our recent study that<br>question trails help but jurors still<br>struggle<br>recognizing that validity of emotions<br>can also humanize the criminal justice<br>process<br>and thereby reduce harm i'm going to<br>give you a final quote an example of a<br>judge<br>humanizing their court that shows the<br>difference it can make<br>not just the defendants but to whanau<br>supporters lawyers<br>and it probably made a difference to the<br>judge as well the judge turned to the<br>gallery<br>and just said does anyone have anything<br>they want to say<br>and the defendant stood up and said i'd<br>like to say something<br>and he pretty much spoke to the family<br>of the victim who died in the gallery<br>and just to ask his friends and family<br>who were there to support him<br>and he was given the opportunity to<br>apologize<br>and to address everyone so that was such<br>a lovely thing to happen<br>this quote reminds us we can do better<br>an approach that recognizes everyone's<br>humanity<br>should not be unusual or comment worthy<br>in an inaugural lecture<br>more diversity in the profession in<br>criminal justice agencies in academia<br>would be a really good start<br>we've not even touched the tip of the<br>iceberg in finding out more about what<br>pacifica and asian communities need<br>in order to be able to adequately access<br>criminal justice<br>perhaps a good place to start is to<br>support people from those communities to<br>do that<br>work so i've thrown down a wee gauntlet<br>this evening<br>for the profession the academy<br>politicians and the wider community<br>for criminal justice reform to work we<br>need to change our mindsets<br>about the criminal justice process about<br>emotion and well-being<br>within it and what reforms should look<br>like we won't get anywhere near<br>aspirations like decarceration if we<br>don't<br>so much more can be done to heal and<br>improve criminal justice<br>to make it better and warm up those<br>hands and heart<br>thank you<br>my name is mark hickford i've been<br>privileged to serve as pro vice<br>chancellor and dean<br>of law here at te herangawaka victoria<br>university of wellington<br>since the 11th of may 2015.<br>in closing before we partake in<br>refreshments beyond<br>these lecture theater doors to my left i<br>propose a vote of thanks<br>for our colleague ahorangi yvette<br>tinsley professor yvette tinsley for her<br>inaugural lecture<br>this evening entitled pale shelter<br>cold hands making criminal justice<br>better one of the distinct pleasures<br>of serving in my role is to have<br>wonderful academic colleagues<br>such as professor yvette tinsley<br>her work is assuredly and proudly<br>sociolegal professor tinsley muses on<br>the possibilities of change<br>seeking to get underneath lived<br>behaviours and practices<br>she undertakes this effort while also<br>analyzing the limitations and<br>infirmities of legal reform<br>if that reform is understood as simply<br>requiring<br>one to merely adjust legislative or<br>other legal settings<br>or limiting one's thoughts concerning<br>criminal processes<br>to justice sector institutions and their<br>practices<br>hers then is an enlarged vista<br>one informed by diverse communities of<br>research endeavour<br>she joins with colleagues from<br>psychology and criminology<br>and exploring the emotions and emotional<br>labor<br>of criminal processes in this venture<br>as set out in her lecture this evening<br>professor tinsley exhibits the profound<br>patience<br>required in scholarship the willingness<br>and curiosity to examine different<br>angles of vision<br>ways of seeing speaking and doing<br>as well as being her lecturer recognizes<br>the seemingly incremental toil of<br>scholarship<br>day by day week by week month by month<br>cumulatively yielding greater insights<br>across time<br>yvette's familial and intellectual<br>whakapapa<br>does not merely reside in this<br>archipelago or in the islands and ocean<br>roads the waka moana of the pacific<br>it lies many miles distant in the<br>northern parts of england<br>in the united kingdom specifically<br>narrated through tales of whanau<br>in nottinghamshire as well as<br>her beloved university in birmingham i<br>she has recounted her memories to me of<br>the thatcher period<br>her fondness for aspects of early 1980s<br>music as well as the later decade<br>music so she has mentioned for instance<br>and mr curtis love will tear us apart<br>as we've witnessed this evening there<br>was a warm lifelong<br>i was thinking of seamus heaney the poet<br>who said so hope<br>for a great sea change on the far side<br>of revenge<br>believe that further shore is reachable<br>from here<br>believe in miracles and cures<br>and healing wells with our eyes cast<br>towards these horizons<br>our colleague challenges us to<br>acknowledge the emotions of justice<br>and the fact that emotions matter for<br>justice<br>yvette tinsley started her lecture with<br>an accepted image<br>from henry moore's famed piece entitled<br>pale shelter dating from 1941<br>during the grave perilous uncertainties<br>of war<br>when death visited from the skies<br>in her ancestral homeland it is an image<br>representing groupings of layered human<br>humans sheltering in the london<br>underground<br>that art was exhibited in the national<br>gallery in london in 1941.<br>the catalogue described it as a vista of<br>recumbent shapes<br>pale as all
