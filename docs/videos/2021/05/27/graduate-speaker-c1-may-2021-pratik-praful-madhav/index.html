and university<br>staff<br>good afternoon and welcome to the<br>ceremony<br>for all fellow graduates from the school<br>of government and business<br>it is an incredible honor and a<br>privilege to be standing here<br>and speaking on behalf of all the<br>graduating students<br>today we are here to celebrate the<br>success of all the graduates<br>i would like to say congratulations to<br>all the graduates from the school of<br>government and business<br>you have reached an important milestone<br>in your life<br>this is a this is an amazing achievement<br>and one you should all be a proud of<br>you have received your golden ticket to<br>the next chapter of your life<br>after many years of blood sweat and<br>tears<br>i'm glad to say we made it<br>every single one of you congratulations<br>we are all a diverse range of students<br>with different interests<br>backgrounds different majors and minors<br>genders<br>ethnicities and today we all get<br>together to celebrate the success<br>of each other's hard work commitment<br>throughout their time at victoria<br>university of wellington<br>and we have all worked extremely hard<br>over the past few years to be here today<br>the life of a university student is not<br>easy<br>we all would have experienced road<br>blumps along the way<br>i am sure everyone remembers 25th of<br>march<br>2020 the day our university experience<br>changed<br>not just for 2020 but for many years to<br>come<br>new zealand went into lockdown<br>universities when online<br>not just for 2020 but for many years to<br>come<br>but i have to say we all as students<br>combated the cover 19 situation<br>adapted our lifestyles and made<br>everything work<br>and we carried on with our studies and<br>today we are here graduating<br>this shows that we are a bunch of<br>resilient graduates<br>who are open to change and can adapt<br>quickly we are a group of leaders who<br>have proved that we can get through<br>any situation and still achieve<br>outstanding results<br>well done from personal experience<br>i'm sure many of you will have<br>experienced many late nights trying to<br>finish an assignment<br>only to start another one which is due<br>in the afternoon and sometimes<br>the assignment might even be worth zero<br>marks<br>or you'll study all day to balance<br>lectures and tutorials just to set a<br>test at 7 30 pm<br>or you'd be staying at the library until<br>it closes and by that time the vending<br>machines on the ground floor<br>become a good friend of yours because<br>vic box is closed for the day<br>and it's too cold to walk down to the<br>supermarket down the road<br>but these are all memories now and they<br>are your stories to tell for many years<br>to come<br>there are many challenges today's<br>graduates would have faced from academic<br>challenges<br>to personal challenges experiencing the<br>coronavirus pandemic would have added<br>challenges to our graduates lives<br>some of the graduates here today would<br>have traveled across the country<br>or even come from overseas to study at<br>victoria university of wellington<br>some of us would have worked part-time<br>jobs to support ourselves and families<br>too<br>some of us yeah some of us would have<br>thought to ourselves many times<br>is university life really for me<br>some of us would have sacrificed many<br>things we valued and<br>i've met some of us would have<br>sacrificed many things we value during<br>our time at university<br>but a similarity between all of us is<br>that we put in the hard work<br>the mahi the dedication and the<br>commitment<br>and that has all paid off and therefore<br>today we can proudly call ourselves the<br>graduates of victoria university of<br>wellington<br>since first year most of the graduates<br>would have noticed the signs on every<br>lamp post on lambton key<br>the signs which reads congratulations to<br>our graduates<br>and we would have thought to ourselves<br>many times when will we be the ones<br>walking down lambton key<br>well today was your day today<br>so many students will be looking at us<br>we will be inspired we will be the<br>inspiration<br>looking back on our journey we couldn't<br>have succeeded without the continuous<br>support of our lecturers<br>tutors and university staff your support<br>and continuous guidance has not gone<br>unnoticed<br>you have taught us many things in our<br>desired interests pushed us to our upper<br>limits<br>and reshaped who we are and ultimately<br>you prepared us for our professional<br>careers<br>to the support staff your work in the<br>background has impacted everyone<br>and kept everything flowing smoothly<br>thank you to all the university staff<br>for all the work you have done<br>at our time at victoria university of<br>wellington<br>to our parents guardians and siblings<br>including my own<br>jay shree and profile thank you for your<br>continuous

there helped each and every single<br>one of us<br>single one of us a lot thank you for<br>sharing your notes when we miss classes<br>or just catching up and moaning about<br>the assignment which is due the next day<br>and complaining that the lecturers ask<br>too much for what the weight of the<br>assignment is<br>without our friends today our journey<br>through university would have been much<br>harder<br>so when you depart here this afternoon<br>make sure you celebrate and recognize<br>the success<br>with success with your loved ones and<br>friends this is an amazing
