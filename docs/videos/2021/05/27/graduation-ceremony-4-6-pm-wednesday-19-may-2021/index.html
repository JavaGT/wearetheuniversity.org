incredible<br>bunch<br>of graduates here tonight but<br>given my huge lack of public speaking<br>experience<br>i'm also very very nervous so please go<br>i would like to start by congratulating<br>you all<br>what a huge accomplishment<br>from my perspective the last three years<br>have been filled with a lot of<br>challenges along the way<br>some of these we shared together like<br>enduring the heavy workload of a student<br>and then of course dealing with the<br>unexpected challenge<br>of covert 19. the zoom fatigue was real<br>not being able to see our peers was<br>isolating<br>and having to resist the temptation to<br>watch an entire netflix series<br>in one night the day before an<br>assignment is due<br>was tough however<br>i'm sure that we also faced our own<br>unique challenges along the way<br>i'm in all of those who managed to<br>juggle their studies with parenthood<br>those who worked part-time or full-time<br>to pay that expense of wellington rent<br>or of those living away from their<br>friends in whanau for the first time<br>whatever the challenges were that we<br>faced as<br>individuals or as a cohort we should be<br>so proud of ourselves<br>but let's not forget about the support<br>networks that we have<br>around us i'm sure that we can all agree<br>that these have played a big role<br>in getting us to where we are today<br>so i want to take a moment to
