style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>i would first like to begin<br>with a quick apology in an ideal world<br>i would have memorized this speech but<br>honestly up until this morning part of<br>me still believed covert would cancel<br>the ceremony<br>so apologies i will have to refer to my<br>notes<br>but nevertheless we are here in person<br>today<br>having graduated in the midst of a<br>global pandemic<br>congratulations everyone it is truly an<br>honour to stand with you all today<br>and reflect on our time at tehrengawaka<br>when i first moved to wellington in<br>february of 2017<br>trump had just been sworn in as<br>president jacinda ardern was an<br>anonymous member of parliament<br>international travel was still an option<br>and the average wellington rent was<br>about 180<br>i anticipated my final year of<br>university to be filled with parties and<br>protests and well<br>less time and lockdown holed up in my<br>parents spare room<br>thanks mum and dad at the risk of<br>sounding incredibly cliche<br>my god how the world has changed since<br>then<br>when i sat down to start writing the<br>speech i honestly had no clue where to<br>start<br>how could i even begin to sum up 2020<br>let alone the other three years of my<br>degree without it sounding like an<br>obituary<br>so i did what i always end up doing i<br>called my mom<br>and she reminded me of the things i<br>loved about my time at vic<br>because these were the things i had<br>shared with my family<br>i was reminded of the amazing fashion<br>and the unapologetic self-expression the<br>effervescence of cuba street with all<br>its bright and beautiful colours<br>the hum of lambton key on any given day<br>the ridiculous and frankly terrifying<br>hand sculpture thing that sits<br>and of course the famous wellington<br>weather<br>i told them of the lecturers who had<br>inspired me with their incredible<br>knowledge<br>and insight of all the powerful unique<br>individuals i had met who inspired me<br>with their candor<br>of the constant political discourse<br>shared and debated by everyone on campus<br>of all the protests i had joined from<br>reproductive rights to climate change to<br>campaign<br>i thought about the people who had held<br>my hand when things got toughest<br>those who listened and shared their<br>vulnerabilities<br>and reminded me that i was enough who<br>commiserated with me<br>over how overpriced and under-insulated<br>my student flat was<br>the people who ensured i ate a hot meal<br>because they knew i existed purely on<br>and those that have extended their<br>compassion lent me their bravery<br>and have turned up today to hear me<br>speak<br>i know that i am not alone and having<br>met people during my time at university<br>that have become family<br>the connections we have forged through<br>some of the best<br>and most difficult years of our lives<br>will stay with<br>us so to my friends who have become<br>my family i want to take this chance to<br>say thank you<br>your kindness honesty and vulnerability<br>inspires me every day<br>i am truly grateful to have you in my<br>life<br>and to my family nani papa<br>mum dad sophie and minnie<br>my love and appreciation for you grows<br>every day even though we may<br>occasionally disagree you are my<br>constants<br>and i would also like to take this<br>opportunity to thank my fellow graduates<br>some of you i know well many of you i<br>have had fleeting interactions over the<br>last four years<br>and well if i'm entirely honest a lot of<br>you i have never seen before in my life<br>and vice versa i'm sure<br>however i am infinitely grateful to each<br>and every one of you for fostering the<br>victoria university community<br>that i hold so dear a community that<br>valued acceptance and learning<br>in which views were shared and<br>challenged but compassion always<br>extended<br>from the commiserating smiles shared<br>during exam season<br>across the lecture theatres or in the<br>colburn library far too late at night<br>to those who were unapologetically and<br>inspiring<br>inspiringly yourselves and made everyone<br>else better for it<br>university has been a passionate and<br>empowering experience<br>passion is a uniting force one that i<br>truly believe<br>resonates strongly with ba students<br>we don't necessarily choose this course<br>of study to get a specific role or to<br>start on a very narrow pathway<br>we study the arts because we love it<br>and that is apparent to all when we<br>interact with them<br>if covert has taught us anything in the<br>past year beyond the importance of<br>frequently washing our hands<br>it's the value of human interactions and<br>empathy<br>which are the pillars of the arts and<br>humanities<br>as funding for the arts and humanities<br>is increasingly limited in favor of<br>technology and the sciences<br>it is passion that keeps the arts alive<br>and thriving<br>passion from the lecturers from the<br>tutors and most importantly<br>from us the students<br>passion and a stable wi-fi connection<br>got us through the distance<br>and disconnection and enabled us to end<br>university is hard but it was made that<br>much harder when we were suddenly cut<br>off<br>from our peers here i need to<br>acknowledge the incredible<br>lecturers and shooters who went above<br>and beyond to make this transition as<br>seamless as possible<br>to the staff who reached out<br>individually to students<br>they had known less than three weeks<br>just to check in with them<br>those who took a compassionate<br>compassionate approach to assignments<br>and deadlines and who went out of their<br>way to make us feel connected<br>in an increasingly unconnected<br>environment<br>by now i'm sure many of you are ready to<br>get out of this hot auditorium<br>and go celebrate with your loved ones so<br>to conclude<br>covert sucked but congratulations on<br>getting through it<br>thank you to everyone here today for all<br>your continued support passion<br>and empathy are so important please<br>continue to let them guide you<br>and if the last few years have taught us<br>anything take<br>each day as it comes there's no use<br>planning<br>we can't predict when the next global<br>disaster or pandemic will occur<br>but we can take the skills we have<br>amassed and continue<br>to listen and learn and apply them to<br>whatever will come our way<br>i'm confident that we can handle<br>whatever the world throws at us next<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
