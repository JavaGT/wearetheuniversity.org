their time at our university<br>has exemplified the qualities that we<br>seek to instill<br>in all our graduates<br>this evening's address will be given by<br>josh allen who has graduated with a<br>bachelor of education<br>in early childhood teaching<br>while he was studying josh co-founded<br>the only education<br>club the uw ece quality<br>this club advocated for diversity in<br>teacher education<br>shared knowledge and strategies to<br>support students both<br>mentally and academically within the<br>degree program<br>and promoted early childhood education<br>and the early childhood education degree<br>at victoria university of wellington<br>and within high schools around<br>tafanganui atara<br>josh is a volunteer mentor for kids camp<br>an organisation supporting<br>and mentoring tamariki in atera<br>during his studies josh was an active<br>member of the faculty of education's<br>advisory committee<br>it has just become a recipient of the<br>teacher education<br>excellence award which acknowledges<br>outstanding students<br>who've excelled in their academic<br>studies<br>this year josh is beginning his master's<br>degree<br>in education at taharangawaka<br>ladies and gentlemen please join with me<br>address<br>to my fellow graduates congratulations<br>we will never forget this moment in our<br>lives<br>through all the mahi sacrifices<br>caffeinated fueled nights<br>financial struggles and not to mention<br>uh global pandemic which resulted in<br>many a painful<br>zoom lecture<br>you know where someone would forget to<br>turn off their mic or the wi-fi would<br>just cut out right mid-sentence<br>we hung in there through it all and can<br>now take a moment to feel proud<br>that we have made it to this point we<br>are empowered<br>in this moment knowledge is power and a<br>degree comes with a power of its own<br>we are in the 35 of new zealanders with<br>a bachelor's degree or higher<br>and this is significantly less in many<br>other countries around the world<br>the next challenge for us now is to<br>decide how we use this newfound power<br>i believe we have options to either<br>accept the world and communities we live<br>in<br>or to change them to create more equal<br>sustainable<br>and just ones the term slash concept of<br>whakamana<br>has been a key reason for me being here<br>tonight<br>whakamane as a word has two parts<br>to cause something to happen and mana<br>which fire ranging<br>would suggest is beyond translation but<br>is based off a person's divine right<br>their influence and their prestige<br>so the concept is based off empowerment<br>and validation<br>is at the heart of tifariki the new<br>zealand early childhood curriculum<br>and is a pretty incredible mantra for<br>approaching this next step in our lives<br>if we can act in empowering ways in our<br>mahi we will probably care for it more<br>therefore have more success create equal<br>workplace environments<br>and enjoy what we're doing if we act in<br>empowering ways to ourselves<br>we will treat ourselves with the respect<br>we desire sustain holistically healthy<br>lifestyles<br>and show resilience in the face of<br>future adversity<br>because in quoting john green we are as<br>indestructible as we believe ourselves<br>to be<br>finally none of us would be here today<br>without the support networks<br>from our whanau friends work family and<br>incredible lecturers<br>and faculty we have had around us over<br>the course of our degrees<br>for many years i battled through an<br>education system as many of my peers may<br>relate to<br>with dyslexia my self-esteem was low<br>and i didn't even achieve ue but through<br>aroha<br>manaki and whakamana from my parents<br>who never let me believe i was not good<br>enough<br>my brothers for keeping me honest my<br>sister-in-law claire for empowering me<br>to feel worthy<br>my partner becky for being the rock to<br>my kite<br>and my mates for keeping me inspired<br>also my classmates specific directly<br>derek laliafano and georgia tortini for<br>saving me numerous times throughout the<br>course of the degree<br>it is now the time that we empower the<br>people in places that have been<br>supporting us<br>to getting here to this point as hiring<br>melbourne would say<br>afimai afiyatu tato tatawe<br>this is our time and let's take hold of<br>our futures<br>i wish to finish with an expert from the<br>peace be upon the world love be upon the<br>world<br>joy be upon the world
