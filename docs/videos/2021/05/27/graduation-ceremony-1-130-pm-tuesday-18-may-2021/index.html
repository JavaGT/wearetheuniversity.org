hard work commitment<br>throughout their time at victoria<br>university of wellington<br>and we have all worked extremely hard<br>over the past few years to be here today<br>the life of a university student is not<br>easy<br>we all would have experienced road<br>blumps along the way<br>i am sure everyone remembers 25th of<br>march<br>2020 the day our university experience<br>changed<br>not just for 2020 but for many years to<br>come<br>new zealand went into lockdown<br>universities when online<br>not just for 2020 but for many years to<br>come<br>but i have to say we all as students<br>combated the cover 19 situation<br>adapted our lifestyles and made<br>everything work<br>and we carried on with our studies and<br>today we are here graduating<br>this shows that we are a bunch of<br>resilient graduates<br>who are open to change and can adapt<br>quickly we are a group of leaders who<br>have proved that we can get through<br>any situation and still achieve<br>outstanding results<br>well done from personal experience<br>i'm sure many of you will have<br>experienced many late nights trying to<br>finish an assignment<br>only to start another one which is due<br>in the afternoon and sometimes<br>the assignment might even be worth zero<br>marks<br>or you'll study all day to balance<br>lectures and tutorials just to set a<br>test at 7 30 pm<br>or you'd be staying at the library until<br>it closes and by that time the vending<br>machines on the ground floor<br>become a good friend of yours because<br>vic box is closed for the day<br>and it's too cold to walk down to the<br>supermarket down the road<br>but these are all memories now and they<br>are your stories to tell for many years<br>to come<br>there are many challenges today's<br>graduates would have faced from academic<br>challenges<br>to personal challenges experiencing the<br>coronavirus pandemic would have added<br>challenges to our graduates lives<br>some of the graduates here today would<br>have traveled across the country<br>or even come from overseas to study at<br>victoria university of wellington<br>some of us would have worked part-time<br>jobs to support ourselves and families<br>too<br>some of us yeah some of us would have<br>thought to ourselves many times<br>is university life really for me<br>some of us would have sacrificed many<br>things we valued and<br>i've met some of us would have<br>sacrificed many things we value during<br>our time at university<br>but a similarity between all of us is<br>that we put in the hard work<br>the mahi the dedication and the<br>commitment<br>and that has all paid off and therefore<br>today we can proudly call ourselves the<br>graduates of victoria university of<br>wellington<br>since first year most of the graduates<br>would have noticed the signs on every<br>lamp post on lambton key<br>the signs which reads congratulations to<br>our graduates<br>and we would have thought to ourselves<br>many
