friends<br>university staff and of course<br>fellow graduates it's hard to know how<br>to summarize a victoria<br>university degree in just five minutes<br>because it is so much more than the<br>assessments<br>the lectures and the piece of paper with<br>hrsa<br>today while writing the speech<br>i've had the pleasure of reflecting on<br>what it means to study at victoria<br>and have done so with a certain talent<br>of nostalgia<br>studying at victoria is battling that<br>chaotic wind<br>which funnels down federerson street<br>that makes us even more disheveled<br>for the morning lectures it's attending<br>that midweek student society event<br>which makes you slightly under the<br>weather for your friday morning tutorial<br>and it is running into these celebrity<br>cat mittens<br>on your way to a lecture if you're<br>having a lucky day<br>studying at vic is also about being<br>surrounded by immense<br>civic engagement you can finish a<br>lecture at 12 30<br>and be in a protest by one whether that<br>be<br>for school strike for climate or march<br>on midland<br>so as i was taking this trip down memory<br>lane about my time at uni<br>i found three key things i'd like to<br>talk about today<br>these are the thing i valued most at<br>university<br>the community the thing i found most<br>challenging<br>studying during the pandemic and the<br>biggest lesson i've learned<br>the immense privilege i have as a degree<br>holder<br>friends classmates university staff<br>lecturers tutors the vic box cafe staff<br>i don't think it's an exaggeration to<br>say that community<br>is key to completing a degree<br>for many of us study formed just one<br>part of our busy lives<br>and although sometimes it could feel<br>overwhelming it was in those moments<br>that the people made the difference<br>the random people you kind of got to<br>know in the library late at night<br>the students who would make and send the<br>memes the friends from o-week<br>that you might still be sitting next to<br>today<br>of course the university community would<br>not be complete without its lecturers<br>we are truly lucky to have world-class<br>academics<br>teaching us at victoria who are<br>incredibly passionate about their field<br>of research<br>and so often go out of their way to<br>engage with students<br>and ultimately anyone who marks 300<br>handwritten exams within a few weeks<br>has my eternal gratitude<br>this community has supported each of us<br>through our studies<br>and is something i will be eternally<br>when i think of my greatest challenge at<br>university<br>it is the disruptions from the pandemic<br>i recognise that we're all extremely<br>lucky to be able to be here today<br>celebrating together when so many<br>communities around the world<br>are not able to do so but<br>in saying that the challenges posed by<br>covid<br>were second to none and i am so proud of<br>the resilience<br>shown over the last year by all<br>graduates in this room<br>just three weeks into semester one in<br>2020<br>the pandemic hit aotearoa in new zealand<br>the country went into lockdown a trip to<br>the supermarket became a luxury<br>i will be forever grateful for the<br>tireless efforts displayed by teaching<br>and professional staff<br>to run online courses or whilst<br>experiencing a pandemic themselves<br>but no one can deny studying by distance<br>was hard<br>the most challenging elements of<br>university the assessments<br>continued but the pandemic had taken<br>away the joys of<br>university the faces in the corridor the<br>coffee breaks<br>and the opportunity to engage with other<br>students<br>in short covert took away our community<br>i think i eventually got so desperate to<br>see classmates again<br>i probably would have turned up to an 8<br>despite these challenges every graduate<br>in the room<br>achieved something amazing you<br>participated in zoom tutorials<br>talking to students on the other side of<br>the screen<br>many of you would have been in cold and<br>damp flats with dodgy internet<br>but with no desk others did uni from<br>lounges<br>and crowded homes some of you<br>were both essential workers and students<br>after being postponed twice last year's<br>december graduation was built the covert<br>graduation<br>but i believe that this ceremony is<br>equally<br>if not more deserving of the name<br>every graduate in this room can say that<br>they studied through a pandemic<br>coming out the other side with a degree<br>in hand<br>each of you navigated your own unique<br>challenges posed by covert<br>with outstanding resilience and we all<br>faced dare i say it<br>an unprecedented situation and for that<br>you should be immensely proud<br>finally i'd like to reflect on what has<br>been for me<br>the key learning at university that is<br>understanding the immense privilege we<br>have as degree holders<br>our pipatia campus is between parliament<br>the wellington business district<br>and the courts truly an incredible<br>location<br>for anyone studying in the school of<br>business and government<br>or the faculty of law but<br>it is also where we have learned of<br>injustices committed in those very<br>buildings<br>a system of property law founded on<br>theft of land<br>a seemingly ever-increasing inequality<br>and a justice system that hyper<br>criminalizes maori<br>i learned from a recent graduate speaker<br>that worldwide<br>only seven percent of people have an<br>undergraduate degree<br>that means each graduate in this room is<br>in an incredibly<br>privileged position as the newest<br>graduates of taherengawaka<br>we must not forget or ignore the<br>learnings from our degrees<br>but aim to achieve a fairer society for<br>all<br>not just for the seven percent that this<br>ceremony represents<br>in the tradition of all graduation<br>speeches i'd like to end<br>by thanking everyone who has supported<br>us graduates through our degrees<br>we could not have made it here without<br>the support of whanau<br>university staff friends flatmates<br>and to the graduates i encourage each of<br>you to reflect<br>on your three four five or even six<br>years of uni<br>over the coming days be incredibly proud<br>of what you have achieved<br>be proud to be a victoria university<br>you</p></main><footer
