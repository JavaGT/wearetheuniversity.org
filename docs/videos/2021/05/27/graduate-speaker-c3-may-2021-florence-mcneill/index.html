stand<br>greetings to you my fellow graduates<br>to hearing iwaka staff and all of our<br>whanau and friends gathered here today<br>it is a privilege and an honour to be<br>your graduate speaker and i thank you<br>for the opportunity<br>now please indulge me for a moment<br>take a look up and around you soak in<br>this beautiful room<br>this is a really special space for a<br>gathering of landscape<br>architecture say hello interior<br>architecture<br>building science design innovation and<br>engineering graduates<br>to come together in celebration<br>and first of all i want to say we did it<br>we made it to this day and no matter<br>whether you came directly from college<br>and made it here in three years<br>or if like me you took the scenic route<br>i want to say congratulations it is a<br>wonderful<br>life-changing achievement and you<br>deserve to bask in this moment<br>i hope you feel proud of the commitment<br>perseverance<br>and determination you found within<br>yourselves to reach this point<br>and we are the lucky ones the privileged<br>ones that has never been so apparent<br>as now when many of our cohort are still<br>experiencing the burden of covert 19<br>lockdowns and loss<br>let us acknowledge and encourage those<br>who are striving to begin<br>to continue and to complete their<br>studies<br>i wonder if many of us really<br>comprehended<br>the personal growth journey that this<br>study thing would turn out to be<br>as students we each face very personal<br>set of challenges<br>and these could define our experience of<br>university if we allowed them to<br>for some it is the leap of becoming<br>independent and leaving home for the<br>first time<br>there may have been language barriers or<br>financial hardship<br>learning or physical difficulties<br>and feelings of isolation and it's<br>complicated we worry about climate<br>change<br>more recently covert 19 and indeed the<br>freedom to safely participate<br>in our cultural practices and beliefs<br>i want to acknowledge that we have all<br>in our own ways<br>faced personal fears and challenges and<br>yet we have persevered and we have<br>prevailed<br>i like to believe that what defines us<br>is not the nature or the magnitude<br>of these challenges but that we have<br>grown stronger<br>wiser and more courageous<br>and with this i'd like to now say a<br>whakatoki which for me expresses<br>my success should not be bestowed on to<br>me alone<br>it was not individual success but the<br>success of a collective<br>which brings me to the whanau family<br>members and friends who are supporting<br>us today<br>both in spirit and sitting among us now<br>with your love your belief in us<br>and all the many ways in which you've<br>given your encouragement<br>we've made it to this day<br>the successes of these graduates are<br>also very much<br>your successes so from the bottom of our<br>hearts<br>and to the knowledge guardians<br>the current caretakers of this great<br>intergenerational learning technology<br>that we call university<br>to all of you who have taught us who<br>have upholded<br>this institution for the love of<br>education in<br>furthering our collective complicated<br>human endeavor we say thank you<br>personally i would like to thank all of<br>the dedicated<br>and excellent school of landscape<br>architecture staff<br>who have made our experience here so<br>rich<br>and i know this can be said for each of<br>the schools represented here today<br>we can all think of staff who go above<br>and beyond for their students<br>those who inspired and pushed us to<br>achieve more than we knew we were<br>capable of<br>to all of our incredible lecturers and<br>my own experience here at victoria has<br>had its share of challenges<br>i started architecture in my late<br>twenties when my eldest daughter was two<br>with the encouragement of a wise friend<br>the two of us moved here from aotear to<br>back to aotearoa<br>from berlin so that i could study i was<br>on my own<br>i didn't have any of the basic<br>qualifications<br>but i was striving to make a future for<br>myself and my daughter<br>it was lonely but i was utterly<br>determined to succeed<br>i remember carrying my sleepy little<br>two-year-old home<br>from crate each day and her bag<br>and my bag and a pile of books<br>and a great brick of a laptop<br>i would literally grip my teeth into the<br>freezing wellington gale<br>it was a thoroughly exhausting time but<br>it was also exhilarating and expanding<br>after an extended break and two more<br>babies<br>i returned to finish my degree but just<br>in case that was too easy<br>i changed major to landscape and it took<br>me another three years part-time to get<br>here<br>phew so i can't tell you how utterly<br>stoked i am to be here right now<br>studying at vic has been the most<br>thrilling and rewarding experience<br>i'm inspired by my millennial classmates<br>i love this way<br>this generation thinks and i feel<br>privileged to learn alongside you<br>i really hope that my story might also<br>inspire some of you<br>to continue learning as you go through<br>life<br>to my wonderful family allegra nico<br>millie mike and noah<br>and the rest of my extended support crew<br>thank you<br>for your loving encouragement to pursue<br>this<br>this year my eldest daughter started a<br>hi milly<br>um thankfully these days she carries her<br>own bag<br>teherengawaka has taught us to think<br>critically<br>to embrace state-of-the-art technology<br>to research deeply<br>to collaborate respectfully and to<br>engage our minds<br>creatively we have knowledge and skills<br>that will serve us well on our paths<br>and i feel sure many of you will go on<br>to tackle some of the most complex<br>as we look forward to working in our<br>respective fields<br>we could also look to our histories our<br>whakapapa<br>where we come from and to those who've<br>gone before us opening up new spaces<br>for me this building represents just one<br>of the many strands<br>on our collective history it reminds me<br>that we're part of a much greater story<br>the connections that we make with our<br>past form a strong vessel that will<br>foreign<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
