A conservation scientist must wield a scientific Swiss army knife to successfully undertake research in these topics that informs policy. Drawing on my own contributions to conservation from a career spanning twenty years, I will provide examples of some of the tools from the natural and social sciences I have found in my scientific Swiss army knife. From islands of the tropics to the subantarctic, along the way will be entertaining stories where a real Swiss army knife has also helped save the day.<br><br>Professor James Russell is jointly appointed in the School of Biological Sciences and the Department of Statistics. He worked in the French territories of Reunion Island and French Polynesia before returning to the University as faculty in 2010. James is a strategic advisor to Predator Free New Zealand, scientific advisor to Zero Invasive Predators, National Geographic Explorer, member of the IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group and life member of the Ornithological Society of New Zealand.<br><br>For more videos from the University of Auckland, visit our YouTube brand channel:

and uh it's such a real<br>pleasure to welcome to the<br>a weird place to be so james has been<br>here uh<br>man and voice since 1997. uh<br>research and french drug firearms so<br>it's a sort of a research regret and you<br>choose your research areas we didn't<br>take you through the research and that<br>was obviously a good choice<br>james is a prolific and influential<br>researcher and invasive invasive species<br>management publications many of those<br>are very high connected ecology journals<br>and more than 5 000 citations it's got a<br>list of prizes that are trying to get<br>right<br>he's been awarded the prime minister's<br>emerging scientist prize the university<br>of oregon early career research<br>excellence award<br>university of auckland north early<br>career research excellence<br>um the society for conservation of<br>biology to civil service awards and<br>development discovery fellowship so it's<br>an amazing stream of honours<br>but james stillsby that i think is<br>probably most famous for us for losing a<br>rat<br>and being unable to catch it during his<br>phd<br>an incident that he was able to turn<br>into a nature paper<br>the front page of the new york times and<br>the children's book while woody<br>himara uh so he's now standing for his<br>age and the children who first read that<br>book and they are our first year<br>students<br>so just wait until the point where<br>you're now teaching the children of the<br>james's teaching has included our<br>teaching field<br>work methods to impose undergraduate<br>students because of the city of women<br>increasingly disconnected from nature as<br>it's driving great<br>um emphasizing how important it is that<br>graduate students<br>explore the um philosophy and ethics of<br>this<br>practice as well as the science itself<br>and combining his parallel expertise and<br>passion of both ecology and statistics<br>his graduate service both national<br>leaders and nationally and james's<br>record<br>he's worked closely with doc to provide<br>a scientific basis for policy<br>and management uh showcasing new<br>zealand's oil and conservation expertise<br>to the world<br>and of course there's a leading figure<br>in predator free resident<br>james and i do have two things in common<br>um i've been a<br>stake in volunteer for a lot of years<br>there's a lot of people here<br>and their 15 direct bait stations are in<br>my house just now<br>so that uh the contents of james is<br>lectured and there's a<br>particular interest not only to me but i<br>bet a lot of<br>it's really shared that this is<br>important to our lives<br>we also think that we're the only new<br>professors in the show pictures of<br>swaziland like knives and our inaugural<br>lecture slides<br>so please join me in welcoming to the<br>stage uh professor john drexel from<br>brisbane<br>thank you very much doug and it's um i<br>must say thank you all of you it's<br>wonderful to see so many friendly faces<br>um here this evening to be able to um<br>celebrate this occasion with me<br>and um hopefully tolerate listening to<br>me for about an hour as i go through<br>um really what's been a careers work so<br>far that's led me to get here<br>and what i want to emphasize today<br>tonight and communicate to you is how in<br>trying to be a conservation biologist<br>you really have to escape those<br>disciplinary boundaries<br>where you think this is the tool i want<br>to use and<br>apply to every problem and go what is<br>the problem and what tool do i need to<br>draw upon<br>to use it so like the the swiss army<br>knife that my mother and father gave me<br>when i was young and i took hiking<br>tramping<br>all the time and there was always a tool<br>for every occasion that's the approach<br>i've come to realize is necessary for<br>conservation biology<br>and and that swiss army pocket knife<br>ends up being quite a powerful tool but<br>one where you're always wondering<br>where's that tool that i need right now<br>or what's this tool actually supposed to<br>do but i think i'll try and use it<br>anyway even if this isn't<br>exactly the way i should be using it<br>so i'm going to start this is me when i<br>was young<br>and clearly a fan of sesame street but<br>also a fan of birds<br>my passion as a new zealander is for<br>birds<br>ironically these photos are from<br>wilson's promontory in the south of<br>australia<br>and these birds although used to be<br>found in new zealand as an introduced<br>species which i suppose is also ironic<br>given that's where my career is now<br>focused<br>we're a very friendly pet that you could<br>find at wilson's prometry and<br>they really helped me engage with nature<br>and as doug alluded to it's absolutely<br>critical i think that people engage with<br>nature in a very hands-on way and we<br>create every opportunity possible<br>for them to do it so um it's fair to say<br>i like our feathered friends quite a bit<br>and want to do everything i can<br>to protect them so<br>naturally and particularly as a<br>university of auckland undergraduate in<br>the 1990s all paths led to te<br>terimatangi island which john craig and<br>neil mitchell set up as a groundbreaking<br>pioneering project for not only new<br>zealand conservation but global<br>conservation this idea that you can take<br>a<br>relatively heavily impacted site in this<br>case a farmed<br>lighthouse island and restore it into<br>something today where if you go out to<br>territory it seems like it's the<br>original forest<br>and the original birds have all been<br>placed back there and i had the<br>opportunity to go out there in 1991<br>myself there and my clearly my favorite<br>skateboard<br>jumper with my little brother douglas<br>who's doing a phd in psychology<br>in melbourne at the moment and my father<br>there who was<br>forced as he said me and my i led my<br>brother off an adventure around<br>territory to look for some birds<br>and my father spent about an hour<br>wandering around the 200 hectare island<br>looking for us<br>this was for the takahe release on<br>territory matangi and it was absolutely<br>amazing to see a bird such as that<br>presumed extinct rediscovered in the<br>1930s in the murchison mountains brought<br>back<br>to territory ireland and um really<br>amazing to be there<br>for it and and i did love the takahe as<br>a child so when i came to the university<br>of auckland i wanted to be a bird<br>conservation biologist<br>due to some twists of fate that many of<br>you are probably aware of the only phd<br>that professor mccloud was offering at<br>the time<br>uh was on rats so put aside your love of<br>birds because for the rest of this hour<br>you're probably going to hear a lot more<br>about rats<br>which are the primary threat to our<br>native birds of new zealand<br>fast forward to 2010 when i start a<br>faculty position at the university of<br>auckland<br>this is greg the takahe on te te matangi<br>perhaps remembering me from years past<br>and<br>i'm not sure again it's hard to tell<br>whether he's liking me or hating me<br>there with what's going on but certainly<br>and we had a another personal engagement<br>that once again just emphasizes how much<br>i think having those<br>interactions with wildlife are so<br>critical for uh<br>people as they as we want to help them<br>so conservation biology this topic that<br>i've apparently dedicated my life to<br>it's the study of the conservation of<br>nature and biodiversity<br>with the intent of protecting species<br>their habitats and ecosystems<br>from excessive rates of extinction as<br>i've learned recently from working with<br>colleagues in philosophy there's quite a<br>lot to unpack and just simply saying we<br>want to conserve nature<br>and we want to conserve biodiversity so<br>at the end of this talk we're going to<br>come full circle from the biologist<br>engaging in the philosophy that was<br>ostensibly the subject of a doctorate in<br>philosophy<br>and wondering what is nature and what is<br>biodiversity and what do we really want<br>to achieve at the end of this with our<br>time<br>i'm entirely motivated by what you call<br>translational<br>in the life sciences or action based in<br>the social sciences research<br>if my research isn't changing what<br>managers do and what people do and what<br>we do as a society<br>then most of you are probably aware i<br>become demotivated pretty quickly<br>about the nature of the topic but what's<br>absolutely critical is that new zealand<br>is uniquely placed to lead in island<br>conservation<br>we are one of the few island nations in<br>the world that is an affluent society<br>inhabiting an independent island state<br>so that is a powerful combination of two<br>things coming together<br>which means socially politically and<br>culturally it's not a coincidence that<br>we lead the world<br>in island conservation it comes about<br>specifically because of those<br>circumstances<br>the other places in the world where i've<br>worked which come close to this<br>a reunion island a french island off the<br>coast of madagascar but it's as much<br>part of france<br>as hawaii is part of the united states<br>another place i've worked<br>where you have two affluent nations<br>living on an island but both of those<br>island states are burdened by the fact<br>that the predominant mindset<br>is from continental ecologists and what<br>you'll see is the recurring theme<br>tonight<br>is that in continental ecology it's all<br>about mammals and predators being a<br>natural part of ecosystems<br>but that's not the case on islands and<br>so very early on<br>in its history new zealand deshackled<br>itself from those continental mindsets<br>that<br>um that impinge on conservation and took<br>a purely island-based approach so i'm<br>very<br>proud to continue being the torchbearer<br>for the importance of that approach<br>yet as much as new zealand's unique in<br>that respect the biodiversity challenges<br>new zealand faces are common to every<br>island on the planet<br>we're not particularly special in any<br>regard we're just like the galapagos<br>or the high arctic islands or the<br>islands of the western indian ocean<br>or indeed any island where people<br>brought introduced mammals with them<br>and the impact of those introduced<br>mammals were devastating so what we do<br>in new zealand<br>can be translated entirely directly to<br>the rest of the world<br>and this is shown here by this analysis<br>we undertook a few years ago of threats<br>to iucn red listed species so the iuc in<br>the international union<br>for the conservation of nature maintains<br>a list of species that are critically<br>endangered with extinction<br>what you can see here is in the orange<br>are all of the red listed species<br>found around the world and this is the<br>ranking of the threats<br>to them as of today over exploitation<br>agricultural activity and urban<br>development<br>are leagues ahead as the major threats<br>to our biodiversity<br>today but what's interesting is when you<br>look in the blue bubbles you see how<br>many of those species<br>are species found wholly on islands and<br>the most shocking statistic there to be<br>honest is that just under half of the<br>iucn red listed threatened species<br>are found wholly on islands islands make<br>up only five percent of land area<br>but they make up fifty percent of<br>species threatened with extinction<br>and the other point i want to refer you<br>to is that if you look at those<br>statistics it's the blue invasion and<br>disease one<br>where 73 of species on islands<br>threatened are<br>threatened by invasion and disease are<br>species threatened on islands so by far<br>invasion and disease is the only threat<br>more likely to be impacting a species on<br>an island<br>so traditionally we think of invasive<br>species as things like stoats<br>and rats and possums but now we're all<br>learning that disease<br>in the forms of kaori dieback uh myrtle<br>rust or even the global pandemic<br>pandemic of covert 19 are the kinds of<br>threats of humans introducing things<br>well beyond<br>natural boundaries and the impacts that<br>follow from those so<br>it's no surprise then that as an island<br>nation focusing on conservation all<br>paths naturally lead<br>first to trying to solve the invasion<br>and disease threat<br>and after that we can try to remediate<br>some of these other equally important<br>threats<br>in that they pose a risk to species<br>extinction<br>so so far to date my swiss army pocket<br>knife of conservation biology tools<br>which i will go through one by one<br>tonight as i flick it out on my<br>metaphorical swiss army knife is field<br>work computer science<br>molecular ecology biogeography<br>population biology<br>mathematics community ecology stable<br>isotopes statistics<br>social science phylogeography<br>macroecology<br>and finally philosophy<br>so let's start with field ecology where<br>it all really began<br>the question here is how do we detect<br>single rats invading islands this was<br>the question doc posed<br>for my phd topic doc funded for my phd<br>topic and doc strongly suggested<br>i find islands without rats and<br>reintroduce rats to them<br>to find out how rats invade islands<br>i couldn't say no to a topic such as<br>that thinking of all of the media<br>headlines i was bound to end up in one<br>way or another<br>and indeed that bore out the result of<br>this study although quite painstakingly<br>for a four year phd<br>was i managed to release a total of five<br>norway rats individually<br>onto an island and radio track them for<br>four weeks<br>the outcome that changed conservation<br>practice was we had confidence in<br>intercepting rats re-invading islands<br>thus clearing islands with high<br>re-invasion rates we can now tackle<br>islands like rangitoto<br>and moto tapu the attitude now is not<br>what will it is not<br>but rats will get back there but of<br>course rats will get back there but the<br>question is what do we do<br>when they get back it's exactly the same<br>with our covert border biosecurity we<br>know covert will cross into the border<br>how we are judged is by our response to<br>it once it crosses over into the border<br>and so i'm very pleased that that body<br>of field ecology work from my phd<br>created that change in policy and<br>confidence for the department of<br>conservation<br>so this is what happened it meant<br>basically going out to an island and as<br>i said working my first<br>nine to five uh job it was nine at night<br>till five in the morning<br>and every hour on the hour i would<br>wander around this tin hectare island<br>and the hauraki golf with this radio<br>antenna<br>and try to locate a single rat upon it<br>and that was quite exhilarating at times<br>when there was lightning<br>but nonetheless data must be collected<br>so as a phd student one takes those<br>risks<br>we collected uh data points here of<br>where this rat was located on the island<br>every hour<br>over four weeks so the first rat the<br>second rat<br>um that third rat's only about a half<br>rep because he managed to wrestle his<br>radio collar off him<br>and there's a fourth rat there i'm not<br>even going to show you a fifth rat<br>because<br>the collar failed so actually i only<br>ended up with three and a half rats<br>worth of data<br>but those are just details really in the<br>history of time now<br>uh we did manage to get a paper out of<br>this i collaborated with a colleague who<br>was doing his<br>phd in neuroscience and he had a model<br>a simulation model for neurons firing<br>around in brains<br>cells and i said i think i can apply<br>that to my rats bouncing around the<br>island<br>so what we see here is on the the top<br>left there<br>is the area of the island that a rat<br>would cover in any single night and it<br>comes out just shy of two hectares so a<br>rat<br>at its peak activity covers about two<br>hectares but what we see<br>on the top right there is uh every day<br>the rat explores a new part of the<br>island increasing its range across the<br>whole island until after about three to<br>four weeks it's explored the whole 10<br>hectares on the island<br>but the question then is is the rat<br>being systematic and having some deeper<br>meaning to its exploration or is this<br>really just<br>come about by chance so that's where<br>that random simulation model came into<br>play<br>and what we found here was that the rats<br>were although there's some signal they<br>might have been being systematic<br>really they're just doing what their<br>computer scientists call a drunk man<br>walk<br>which is wandering around the island and<br>seeing where they end up because it's<br>all very new to them<br>like when we explore a new city and just<br>kind of find where we end up<br>without having a map to follow<br>but as some of you and stop me if you've<br>heard this one before<br>this rat the first rat raza started here<br>and did a little trixie thing on me when<br>his radio caller stopped working<br>and ended up here so obviously i think<br>most of you know what happened next<br>what happened next was a bit of this on<br>the island<br>which by the way is a genuine swiss army<br>knife moment because this was in the<br>days when wine bottles were corked and<br>if you didn't have a swiss army knife in<br>your field work trip kit<br>you'd be in a bit of trouble but then<br>after that this happened<br>and it was turned into a proof of<br>concept that<br>there is indeed at least one rat in the<br>world that is very very difficult to<br>catch when it gets back to an island<br>so then you may be able to guess what<br>happened next<br>there was a bit more of this but in a<br>good way uh but then<br>what happened next was even stranger was<br>um unbeknownst to me whittier hamada<br>decided to write<br>this and i do have a copy of it here<br>tonight if anyone wants to<br>read it but rest assured you don't have<br>to uh because as well as being on the<br>front page of the new york times you can<br>listen to it<br>as a download on radio new zealand as a<br>soothing bedtime story<br>sleep<br>so the next question was how do we<br>determine which species of rat<br>is invading an island and here some<br>tools from computer science proved<br>really powerful<br>the method we used was pattern<br>recognition and classification of wrap<br>footprint tracks<br>so we've got three different species of<br>rat in new zealand rattus rattus rattus<br>norvegicus and rattus exulins the<br>blackrat or shiprat<br>norwayrat or brown rat and the<br>polynesian rat or kyodi<br>and so when we find wrap footprints<br>going through a tracking tunnel<br>we don't know what species it is and we<br>need to tailor our biosecurity response<br>to those different species<br>and what we found using these computer<br>science algorithms is an 80<br>success rate assigning rat footprints to<br>the species<br>and the outcome of this is we can tailor<br>our biosecurity responses to the rat<br>species<br>and now with further advances develop<br>digital devices for rodent biosecurity<br>instead of using tracking cards we can<br>now use the<br>touch screens of cell phone devices and<br>the rat walks over those and in real<br>time you can<br>determine what the species is and<br>prepare your biosecurity response<br>so here we see it it seems quite uh the<br>eye is an absolutely powerful pattern<br>recognition algorithm we can see<br>or at least a number of you in this room<br>will be able to see the wrap footprints<br>in here i know many of you will have<br>stared at hundreds of these cards<br>if not thousands in your lifetime we see<br>those wrap footprints it's very hard<br>to convince a computer that the black<br>dots<br>make patterns of these wrap footprints<br>but nonetheless we created an algorithm<br>that could do that automatic patent<br>recognition<br>and then it could identify them and<br>confidently assign them to this is a<br>norway rat<br>and then we can launch a norway rat<br>tailored response<br>so that was really powerful for the<br>department of conservation as well<br>then more questions came along and<br>towards the end of my phd<br>the department of conservation wanted to<br>know how do we know if rats repopulating<br>an island are survivors or re-invaders<br>you complete your rat eradication<br>those re-invaders come because you're<br>doing riskier eradications but then<br>suddenly<br>you've got rats across your island and<br>you don't know these ones that survive<br>from the eradication a year ago<br>or swam over very recently and at this<br>time microsatellites were the cutting<br>edge of molecular biology<br>and we use genetic fingerprinting of<br>rats and you can match them with either<br>the pre-eradication<br>or the potential source population to<br>determine whether these are survivors<br>or re-invaders in this case thankfully<br>for doc we determined that their<br>eradication methodology was still<br>successful<br>they hadn't failed at the eradication<br>but the rats they had were very very<br>rapidly invaders this was for a small<br>island off southern stuart island<br>where they did not expect rats would be<br>willing to swim across the very cold<br>channel<br>but nonetheless they had a dozen rats<br>swim over within a year of that<br>eradication being completed the outcome<br>of that that changed management practice<br>was that genetics is now a standard<br>operating procedure for rodent<br>eradications and biosecurity<br>and so those genetic samples are<br>collected routinely and laboratories are<br>analyzing them<br>so to show you that in detail this is<br>pearl island off the the southeast coast<br>of stewart island<br>doc were only monitoring the rats around<br>the coast<br>and indeed they found all these rat<br>captures here so they weren't sure<br>whether these were<br>survivors around the coast or<br>re-invaders swimming over<br>so here we can see what a plot looks<br>like those blue<br>dots on the upper left are the stuart<br>island sample so if a rat comes from<br>that population that blue population we<br>know it's swum over from stuart island<br>on the the lower right-hand side we see<br>the pre-eradication the original<br>population on the island<br>so all we have to do is take new rats<br>that we capture on the island<br>and assign them to either the blue dots<br>which means they're a swimmer<br>or to the red dot which means they're a<br>survivor from the eradication<br>they had two species turn up not just<br>one but two species from this three<br>species rodent eradication<br>and they all assigned uh to the stewart<br>island population which meant doctor<br>with confidence using<br>microsatellite genotyping that rats were<br>swimming over very rapidly from stuart<br>island and biosecurity was the issue<br>on this island not eradication<br>implementation<br>so uh with my time done in new zealand<br>uh it was time to move to this<br>gentleman's uh<br>private atoll in french polynesia uh<br>this is marlon brando<br>and this is teteroa atoll he purchased<br>it in 1967<br>when filming mutiny on the bounty and<br>being marlow being a<br>a little eccentric he prevented any<br>development happening<br>on it what he did do is on that island<br>in the upper right he developed an eco<br>hotel and invited all his hollywood<br>colleagues to come there<br>they weren't quite prepared for marlon's<br>interpretation of an eco hotel which was<br>literally just a thatched room and a<br>serve yourself at the bar<br>and cook your own meals so he never<br>really got the big hotel going that he<br>thought it might be<br>but the island was relatively pristine<br>and protected as compared to most of the<br>other atolls in french polynesia during<br>the<br>80s and 90s hotel boom so i ended up<br>finding myself in the tropics<br>which was a bit of a change and i spent<br>the next two years working in french<br>tropical<br>islands trying to implement some of the<br>conservation tools we have from new<br>zealand<br>for their very similar problems and the<br>first question that came up is when is<br>the best time to target rat population<br>for eradication on tropical islands<br>and the method we used here was a<br>biogeographical one of a global analysis<br>of rat eradication success on islands<br>the result was we identified four<br>different island biome types<br>where eradications tend to happen around<br>the world and the outcome<br>was that now rat eradication is tailored<br>to the island biome<br>whether that be in the tropics or the<br>temperate regions<br>so let me go into a little bit more<br>detail on that what we actually did<br>was uh collected environmental data for<br>all of the islands around the world<br>where eradications have occurred<br>the red crosses are successful<br>eradications the black triangles are<br>unsuccessful eradications<br>and you can see here we collected data<br>on the variation in temperature<br>across a year so uh islands such as in<br>temperate new zealand can be quite warm<br>during summer but quite cool over winter<br>whereas in the tropics islands tend to<br>have reasonably constant variation<br>in temperature because they stay quite<br>hot we also have precipitation and<br>rainfall<br>so you can have wet and dry seasons or<br>you can have constantly wet islands<br>and also on the amounts of rainfall and<br>temperature themselves so we managed to<br>classify<br>through a clustering process these four<br>different island types so you can see on<br>the the left-hand side of the temperate<br>islands of new zealand<br>a very high success rate for<br>eradications ninety percent<br>uh but then we have three other biomes<br>so not all tropical islands islands are<br>created equal<br>we have savannah islands very dry<br>islands where the success rate is very<br>high for eradication<br>we have tropical seasonal uh wet dry<br>islands where there have been a lot of<br>eradications but also a good number of<br>failures<br>but the really concerning area were the<br>tropical wet islands they're constantly<br>warm<br>and they're constantly wet which creates<br>a dream habitat for rats<br>and a failure rate for rat eradications<br>around 50<br>so by interpreting these four biomes we<br>ended up trying to<br>work out when timing of eradications<br>could best be done so in temperate new<br>zealand<br>we see here that in winter things cool<br>off primary productivity dries up<br>and the rat population then lags so that<br>blue area is that lag when rats are<br>vulnerable it's happening right now<br>around us once again the rats are hungry<br>the rats are cold<br>most of you are probably experiencing<br>them coming into your houses in some<br>form<br>and we're trying to remove them so in<br>new zealand we know you target<br>eradications at winter<br>in contrast on the top right there is<br>tropical seasonal forest<br>it tends to be quite wet and has a very<br>short dry season<br>but that dry season is a great<br>opportunity to target the rats but that<br>dry season isn't necessarily<br>during summer or during winter it's just<br>when the dry season occurs<br>in that part of the world down the<br>bottom left we have the savannas which<br>are mostly dry but they have a rainfall<br>pulse that creates an explosion in the<br>rat population<br>but just after that explosion like a<br>mass seeding event in new zealand<br>the food dies off the rats become hungry<br>so you target the rats just after that<br>rainy season<br>on those savannah islands but once again<br>we end up at the very concerning<br>tropical rainforest islands where it's<br>wet all the time<br>and to be honest there's not really a<br>clear time to target them you just have<br>to target them with all guns blazing<br>recognizing that those rats are probably<br>not looking for food because there's<br>lots of alternative food and they're<br>probably breeding at the time<br>which are really challenging conditions<br>but and as i learned this was 10 years<br>ago when i was only applying<br>temperate experience so myself and<br>sandra anderson and mike lee tried to<br>undertake<br>one of the early rat eradications on<br>tropical islands and<br>it turns out a really good time not to<br>do a rat eradication is during a cyclone<br>that's a really bad time to do an<br>eradication so this is<br>also a swiss army knife moment because<br>you're told<br>you've got one hour to evacuate the<br>island and everything you take with you<br>is all you will be taking with you<br>so in my hands there i think i see my<br>field notebook<br>i think my laptop's there and my<br>passport and my swiss army knife because<br>we were promptly evacuated and dropped<br>off<br>in papiti and told we'd been saved even<br>though all of our bags<br>were left on the island and we had 24<br>so then moving to the western indian<br>ocean and applying some population<br>biology tools<br>do rat population dynamics change in<br>coexistence with introduced mammals rats<br>on an island by themselves are<br>reasonably straightforward to eradicate<br>it becomes more interesting when those<br>rats are competing with mice<br>or when those rats are coexisting with<br>cats preying upon them<br>so what we did here was a capture<br>restudy of rats on islands with<br>different suites of introduced mammals<br>the result was rat population dynamics<br>do differ substantially in the presence<br>of co-existing mammals<br>and the outcome which change management<br>is rat eradication method and timing is<br>tailored<br>depending on the co-existing mammals<br>so off to europa island the french<br>maintain a number of military base<br>islands around the coast of madagascar<br>they're called the scattered islands the<br>ilse pass<br>and this is the the largest of them<br>so comparing here in the north of the<br>mozambique channel juan de nova where<br>there were mice<br>with ship rats with cats and with europa<br>in the south<br>where ship rats exist alone the question<br>here becomes how do rat population<br>dynamics differ<br>in these two islands<br>and what we found where at the top you<br>have the population dynamics of the rats<br>on europa<br>and at the bottom you have the<br>population dynamics of rats onto under<br>nova<br>key things to see here is when the rat<br>exists alone it very much feels it's<br>living the island life it's uh not<br>competing with any other species<br>whereas onto and over it feels much like<br>they're just back in downtown new york<br>there's cats there's mice<br>it's a pretty busy time so what we see<br>here<br>is that there's post recruitment on<br>europa island so the rats are reasonably<br>lazy<br>and they don't necessarily breed um over<br>winter they just breed over summer so<br>you have a<br>you do see the population cycle but it's<br>because of pulse juvenile recruitment so<br>there's a big breeding event<br>in summer and not so much of a breeding<br>event<br>over winter you also see an elevated<br>density in the absence of cats and mice<br>preying upon them and competing with<br>them<br>the rats can maintain a higher density<br>on europa island<br>and finally you do see that stronger<br>population cycling because of that pulse<br>juvenile recruitment<br>whereas antoine de nova the population<br>cycling is dampened<br>and the rats on that island tend to<br>so moving on back to reunion island the<br>headquarters for this<br>research project the question was does<br>cat control release rat populations<br>increasing impact on seabirds it's a<br>common question around the world and one<br>we grapple with often in new zealand<br>the method here was coupled non-linear<br>differential equations of cat rat and<br>seabird population dynamics<br>the result was feral cats had the<br>greatest impact on seabird populations<br>and urgently required management<br>and the very clear outcome which i<br>cannot emphasize enough<br>is that rat presence should never be<br>used as an excuse not to manage cat<br>populations<br>cats do not control rat populations<br>ever so this is reunion island<br>and if you want to know the exact field<br>spot i was working on it's that<br>very high cliff on the top right hand<br>side<br>of the island although the seabirds did<br>gather at about 5pm around the coast<br>where all the bars were and we could<br>watch them while we sipped our french<br>cocktails<br>unfortunately at about 5 p.m they all<br>fly to the highest summits on the island<br>which are about a six hour hike<br>where you then access your field site to<br>study these birds<br>what we did was we created these partial<br>differential equation models<br>having a population of cats a population<br>of rats and<br>an age structured population of seabirds<br>they have a juvenile phase much like our<br>graphics petrol in new zealand<br>they go through five years being a<br>juvenile at sea and then they come back<br>as adults and breed<br>so there's a lot going on here the rats<br>predominantly prey upon the chicks<br>and that's where the strongest impact is<br>the cats don't really prey upon the<br>chicks because the chicks are safely<br>locked away<br>in burrows but the cats do prey upon the<br>adults<br>and the cats also prey upon the rats the<br>cats also prey upon<br>other foods such as native reptiles the<br>rats also feed on other vegetation<br>and the change we can make in the<br>population is removing rats<br>or removing cats from the population so<br>putting all this together<br>with a number of number of parameters we<br>could look at what the impact<br>of cats and rats relatively were and the<br>take home message really is that<br>one adult seabird is worth about five<br>seabird chicks<br>which is worth about 10 seabird eggs so<br>for every<br>adult seabird you lose you've lost the<br>equivalent of five chicks<br>or 10 eggs so the adults are really most<br>valuable in this population<br>as the breeding unit so there's<br>uh four graphics here and they all start<br>off from the same place<br>which is that there's sea birds and rats<br>on this island<br>the seabirds are slowly going extinct or<br>quite rapidly going extinct in fact<br>and cats have made their way up into the<br>mountain tops and are starting to impact<br>on the seabird population<br>at the top we have what's called<br>bottom-up regulation<br>the rat and cat population or the rat<br>population in particular is controlled<br>by the food resources<br>whereas down the bottom food resources<br>aren't so important and what's important<br>is how much predation on the rats there<br>are from cats<br>on the left hand side we'll only be<br>looking at cat control<br>whereas on the right hand side we'll be<br>looking at much more labor-intensive<br>cat eradication so on the left-hand side<br>it's bottom-up the rats are limited by<br>food and we're just going to control the<br>rat pop<br>the cat population so we do take about<br>half of the cats out of the system uh<br>the rat population<br>doesn't really change that much because<br>they're still limited by food<br>they're happy not to be being eaten but<br>there's no more food so they can't<br>increase their population size<br>the seabirds still go extinct<br>now let's try eradicating the cats from<br>this bottom-up system<br>we eradicate the cats the rats once<br>again<br>they're very happy not to be being eaten<br>but there's no more food so they can't<br>increase their population size<br>the seabird population makes a slow<br>painfully slow recovery<br>at least thankful that it's not being<br>eaten by cats anymore<br>so now let's go to the top down system<br>here the rats are being controlled by<br>the cat population<br>so we control 50 of the cats the rat<br>population does<br>increase in numbers because they are<br>being released from predation<br>but the seabird population still goes<br>extinct although the rats are impacting<br>more sea bird eggs and chicks<br>the cats are still there eating those<br>very valuable adults<br>so let's explore cat eradication in this<br>top-down system<br>we completely eradicate cats from the<br>system and our worst fears are realised<br>and the rat population explodes in<br>numbers<br>the cats were controlling the rats but<br>even then because the cats were having<br>that strongest impact by taking out<br>those valuable adult units<br>the seabird population now actually gets<br>saved because it's the cats that needed<br>to be removed from the system<br>and they're just as happy being<br>coexisting<br>with rats in that population so the<br>take-home message there<br>is that we should always really be<br>managing feral cats because there isn't<br>a situation where they're actually<br>managing<br>so it seems important that we actually<br>need to test that hypothesis now what<br>does regulate rodent populations on<br>ireland so the method here<br>was community interaction modelling the<br>result<br>indeed introduced mammals are bottom-up<br>limited on islands it's food pulses<br>it's a mass seeding event it's those<br>rainfall events on the dry islands<br>it's the seasonal summers coming along<br>in temperate islands that feeds the<br>ecosystem from the bottom up like a<br>trophy fountain<br>and so you get more plant growth you get<br>more invertebrates you get more mice you<br>get more rats you get more stoats<br>it's exactly what we see in new zealand<br>with mass seeding that's what controls<br>the population here<br>but those introduced mammals then exert<br>a strong top-down impact<br>by preying upon all the native birds in<br>the system so the outcome of this study<br>was that the removal order and the<br>indirect effects of introduced mammals<br>during eradication were determined so we<br>start to know<br>what if you only take out these species<br>from the system what are the indirect<br>effects<br>and what will be any negative<br>repercussions that we have to prepare<br>ourselves for<br>so to give you an idea these islands all<br>around the world start off<br>in this native state with bird colonies<br>herbivores and primary consumers<br>native vegetation below ground organisms<br>lots going on in the soil system<br>we come along as humans we introduce<br>miso predators such as rodents<br>super predators such as cats herbivores<br>such as rabbits<br>introduced vegetation these all get into<br>complex links with one another<br>which can make it very hard to unpack<br>these ecosystems so we do need to know<br>the order in which we remove them and<br>this then spurred on further research by<br>myself<br>to look at things such as well what are<br>humans views when you lay those on top<br>of this<br>what are humans attitudes to rats versus<br>humans attitudes to cats<br>versus humans attitudes to rabbits<br>versus what's your weed versus your<br>prized flower<br>in your garden and then furthermore<br>working on these coralatols around the<br>tropics i also realized there was<br>something else going to happen in the<br>next 50 years or so<br>which might render a lot of this work<br>irrelevant so i started to<br>take into account what role humans have<br>and climate change in the conservation<br>of islands<br>and when we put this together on europa<br>island we got to see a picture here<br>of cats exerting that predation pressure<br>uh<br>on the rats and then the rats<br>change the density that affects their<br>breeding their home range size<br>rat density is moderated by habitat<br>quality and food pulses<br>the climate's driving the rainfall for<br>those food pulses it all feeds back into<br>the system and we get a relative<br>understanding of top-down versus<br>bottom-up effects<br>and when each of those is dominant in<br>so to sum that up we know now that on<br>these islands<br>the only resource input they have is<br>from the marine interface it comes from<br>seabirds such as boobies and gannets<br>bringing food<br>and marine nutrients from the sea to<br>these islands<br>those islands would naturally exist in a<br>bottom-up limited state<br>but with animal and plant invasion we<br>have these animals such as cats and rats<br>exerting a strong top down limitation<br>and the invasive plants disrupt the<br>bottom-up flow and redirect nutrients<br>in the system in a way that completely<br>disrupts ecosystem processes so that's<br>how we take<br>a whole of ecosystem approach to<br>conservation and don't just focus on<br>particular species<br>coming back to new zealand now and uh<br>tired of the warm tropics off to<br>antipodes island<br>i go for a season<br>and here the impact the question became<br>what impacts do mice have on seabirds<br>we've worried a lot<br>about rodents and rats in particular but<br>what are mice doing and this was around<br>the time when we started to discover on<br>goff island that<br>mice were becoming gigantic and<br>attacking albatross that were 50 times<br>their body size very concerning<br>and there was a legitimate concern that<br>that might be happening on antipodes<br>island<br>the way to understand mouse diet without<br>catching a lot of mice and dissecting<br>them and hoping to get the one that had<br>happened to get lucky and eat an<br>albatross the night before<br>was to undertake stable isotope analysis<br>of mouse diet<br>the result was mouse diets seasonally<br>shifted from lambdas and invertebrates<br>in summer<br>to sea birds and plants in winter and<br>from this<br>we could report back to the department<br>of conservation robust predictions of<br>biodiversity outcomes from the mouse<br>eradication<br>if you do mouse eradication these are<br>the species you expect will come back<br>in the ecosystem so here you can see the<br>the stable isotopes ice escape<br>for summer and winter and those circles<br>there are the different individual mice<br>and their samples and we can see that in<br>summer those mice are tending to<br>dominate<br>on those land birds and the<br>invertebrates once again just that<br>resource pulse that comes on these<br>cooler islands over summer<br>the tussock seeds the invertebrates<br>increase in numbers the lamb birds start<br>breeding<br>the mice switch onto them and prey upon<br>them in contrast in winter<br>that resource pulse is finished the mice<br>are hungry they have to scavenge on the<br>remains of seabirds from the previous<br>summer and they switch on to plants as a<br>diet staple is the only thing that still<br>remains on the island over those cool<br>and that's reflected here in the<br>proportion that those different diet<br>components are<br>in summer versus winter so the good news<br>from this was in 2016 the department of<br>conservation had the million dollar<br>mouse program and eradicated two hundred<br>thousand<br>mice at a cost of about five dollars a<br>mouse and uh<br>antiquities island is now mouse free and<br>we've seen these uh results of this<br>ecosystem booming once again with the<br>invertebrates and the lamb birds<br>so the question became after antipodes<br>island<br>uh you've got a 2 000 hectare island<br>that had 200 000 mice you want to be<br>quite confident you've got all of them<br>because the difference between no mice<br>and one mouse<br>can be quite substantial going forward<br>so can we calculate the probability of<br>successful rodent eradication the method<br>here<br>is a simulation model of the probability<br>of successful eradication<br>given no detections it's the classic<br>false absence problem in statistics<br>if i don't catch anything is that<br>because i'm a really good at catching<br>things and it's not here<br>or i'm really bad at catching things and<br>there's a lot of them here<br>so we need to create a statistical model<br>to balance the two of those out so you<br>can say with confidence<br>when all of these repeated absences of<br>captures are probably because there's<br>nothing there<br>the result from this was we actually<br>found biosecurity dogs significantly<br>increased success confidence during a<br>rodent incursion<br>and the outcome of that is the<br>department of conservation now uses<br>rodent detection dogs<br>as a standard operating procedure for<br>incursion response<br>and we we had a real-time opportunity to<br>do this on great mercury island<br>in 2017<br>so great mercury island is 1800 hectares<br>it's one of the top 10<br>predator-free islands in new zealand and<br>this is the grid<br>of traps around the island to monitor<br>for rat<br>re-invasion you can see some patterns<br>here it's because there's coastal access<br>points<br>and roads on the island but on top of<br>this<br>we can have these traps we can also<br>overlay these tracking tunnels a<br>different type of device you might have<br>a rat<br>with a different personality that<br>prefers to go into a different type of<br>device so we don't just want to put all<br>our eggs in one<br>pest control basket so we also have<br>devices of a different type but once<br>again a lot of them are occurring in the<br>same place because of those<br>accessibility issues<br>of tracks in coastal areas but we had<br>some additional information<br>on great mercury they know when they<br>detected the rat down the southwestern<br>area<br>of the island so if we delimited a<br>radius of two kilometers around this<br>area<br>and we put out more devices to try and<br>catch any rats in that area so we<br>intensified our effort there<br>and then furthermore we took these<br>rodent biosecurity detection dogs<br>and we walked them around the island and<br>in particular we took them off track so<br>they could cover some of the areas<br>where we haven't necessarily got devices<br>placed<br>the outcome of this is we can see that<br>whether you're using a single device<br>type or a multiple<br>device type so one trap or a trap in a<br>tracking tunnel<br>with different statistical probabilities<br>doesn't actually matter too much for<br>your confidence of achieving rat<br>eradication<br>and that's because although the<br>difference in probability of capture<br>might be five percent versus ten percent<br>per night<br>if you're leaving these devices out for<br>30 nights at a time it comes out in the<br>wash and they asymptotically basically<br>have the same probability of detecting a<br>rat<br>what becomes limiting here is where<br>those devices are<br>and whether you have 10 percent 20 30 or<br>50<br>coverage of the island in contrast<br>if we can delimit the incursion area and<br>take a dog around it<br>that dog can go places where it can<br>detect sign that is outside the area<br>of our static devices that don't move<br>around a dog is essentially just a<br>mobile<br>trapping device a sniffer to trap that<br>you move around on a leash<br>and you can see that big spike there<br>from using the dog is because<br>a dog may not walk through where the rat<br>is but if a dog walks through that scent<br>area where a rat is<br>it has a guaranteed 100 detection of<br>sniffing that rat<br>so you know that rat's there and can<br>launch your incursion response there<br>so doc learnt from this that taking<br>these dogs out<br>and using them strategically in the<br>incursion response is a very very<br>powerful way to increase our ability to<br>so as we started to undertake these<br>eradications on these larger and larger<br>islands such as great mercury<br>the question then became do inhabited<br>island human communities<br>differ in their attitudes towards rat<br>eradication<br>so the method here which i worked on in<br>collaboration with the department of<br>conservation and my colleague joe ailey<br>who now works for the department of<br>conservation<br>with surveys of attitudes to pest<br>eradication<br>and the result was we found marked<br>differences in community attitudes to<br>pest management and a rat eradication<br>perhaps shouldn't have been as<br>surprising to a biologist as it is<br>but every island we know has a different<br>ecosystem we know they have different<br>mammals on them so we don't go with a<br>one-size-fits-all<br>uh eradication method to different<br>islands so equally when we want to<br>engage with these inhabited island<br>communities<br>we shouldn't take a one-size-fits-all<br>these islands have different values<br>different things that motivate them<br>so what works to convince one island to<br>do eradication<br>might not be what works on the human<br>community for another so the outcome now<br>today<br>is we can tailor our social science<br>tools to the target<br>island the study we undertook here<br>was on four inhabited islands in the<br>hauraki gulf<br>uh you can see the the noises there<br>where i started small on 10 hectares<br>in the middle but nearby raquino island<br>had norway rats<br>on it and a community of about 20 people<br>kawau island to the north there has a<br>community of about 200 people<br>and has a good menagerie there thanks to<br>governor gray of<br>possums cats rats stoats<br>and friendly wallabies great barrier<br>island has<br>rodents and cats and we have waiheke<br>island with rodents<br>cats and stoats as well very<br>interestingly<br>uh from a natural experiment perspective<br>was that the rats had actually been<br>eradicated<br>from raquino island so not only could we<br>look at the attitudes of these inhabited<br>island communities to pest control we<br>could see how they changed if they knew<br>the benefits of rat eradication<br>having lived through them themselves so<br>joe's masters work found we undertook<br>a pest management attitude scale where<br>we saw what the<br>the propensity of the people living on<br>these islands to support pest control<br>was<br>on raquino island we see independent of<br>whether they're engaged in pest control<br>themselves<br>there's a very high support for pest<br>control and biosecurity<br>similarly we saw that on cow wow island<br>but it dropped off very rapidly on great<br>barrier island<br>waiheke and our control comparison of<br>the auckland mainland<br>we can see that waiheke and great<br>barrier are really behaving more like<br>the mainland where if people don't<br>engage in pest control themselves<br>they're quite removed from it and don't<br>necessarily feel the motivation for<br>doing pest control<br>and so this translates through to<br>support for rat eradication<br>this is the proportion of respondents on<br>each island that support rat eradication<br>do not support it or are unsure and<br>although there's only actually a small<br>amount of<br>often very vocal but nonetheless small<br>number of detractors on each of these<br>islands<br>the the number that are unsure of<br>eradication where doubt has been<br>manufactured<br>is a lot larger on sites such as great<br>barrier island<br>and waiheke island where they're not<br>necessarily so engaged in pest control<br>they haven't seen the costs of pests on<br>their island or the benefits<br>so then i started to wonder do rat<br>populations in new zealand have<br>different<br>origins what if we did a genetic survey<br>a phylogeographic survey of rats<br>across all of new zealand and understood<br>the genetic tapestry of rats<br>and what that might unlock for future<br>potential control tools so<br>we undertook a mitochondrial dna survey<br>of introduced european rats the the<br>shipwreck and the norway rat<br>across all of new zealand hundreds of<br>samples collected variously from island<br>eradication campaigns museum specimens<br>it turns out roadkill is a very good way<br>to get rat samples from places you<br>haven't got them before<br>or just cold door knocking on dock<br>offices and saying i'm coming through if<br>you've got any dead rats in the freezer<br>what we found were there at least three<br>norway rat introductions to new zealand<br>and four<br>ship rat introductions so the outcome<br>from this<br>is we could identify a very high level<br>what some of the barriers to rat<br>invasion<br>were when rats first arrived in new<br>zealand<br>so looking at the norway rat here we can<br>see<br>two invasions there was the initial<br>invasion to the north island of that uh<br>purple<br>rat genotype and that was also the one<br>that ended up on our outlying islands<br>the kermadecks the chathams and campbell<br>island<br>but in the south of new zealand we<br>actually have a different type that<br>arrived later<br>from an independent invasion they didn't<br>cross over from the north island they<br>came on an independent vessel<br>and those are the ones that also ended<br>up on stewart island but also some of<br>the north island ones or from the<br>outlying islands<br>have ended up on stewart island as well<br>and most interestingly<br>there's a very recent new genetic type<br>of norway rat<br>found around bluff area and making<br>incursions inland from there which<br>suggests a more recent invasion<br>through the the shipping port of bluff<br>ship rats tell an even more complicated<br>story we have at least four types i<br>suspect with the recent<br>snip analysis we've done we'll find that<br>these are different independent<br>invasions but there's at least<br>an orange type a red type a green type<br>and a blue type<br>so the red type is found throughout uh<br>the southern north island and then hits<br>a reasonably hard barrier around<br>auckland and the auckland dismouth and<br>then the upper north island<br>has a different genotype and then in the<br>south island<br>we see that same upper north island type<br>except in the southwest of fjordland<br>and around bluff once again where we see<br>that that red genotype<br>when we go to our largest offshore<br>islands of great barrier and stewart<br>island<br>great barrier has its own unique green<br>haplotype but that's been<br>interbred with rat incursions repeating<br>over time from auckland<br>of both the red and the orange type and<br>then if we head down to stewart island<br>interestingly that that has its very own<br>unique genotype<br>but we also found that one of the<br>landmark events that spurred our<br>attitudes to rodent eradication in new<br>zealand was the invasion of big south<br>cape<br>in the early 1960s rats arrived on that<br>island for the first time<br>and within two years three species two<br>birds and one bat went globally extinct<br>never to be seen<br>again because of rats arriving on that<br>island those rats that arrived on big<br>south cape<br>were the orange phenotype that comes<br>from the south island<br>uh probably from the fjordland area as<br>hypothesized from where the fishing<br>boats were coming from<br>and had nothing to do with stewart<br>island so for the first time a few years<br>ago<br>we ascertained where that rat invasion<br>that was critical to new zealand<br>conservation came<br>from<br>so one of the questions that i often<br>have to grapple with is people say well<br>invasive species are increasing<br>biodiversity and indeed new zealand has<br>more species than ever before<br>so if we're simply counting species<br>alone then we're doing really well for<br>conservation in new zealand<br>the method here is quite simply a<br>thought experiment<br>and the result was we found alpha<br>diversity increases from invasive<br>species indeed if you find any one<br>island<br>and chuck 20 or 50 or 100 new species on<br>it<br>you've increased species richness but<br>it's the same species being introduced<br>everywhere around the world<br>and different ones going extinct we're<br>losing global<br>or gamma biodiversity and we're also<br>learning that<br>losing the difference between islands so<br>two islands that had different faunism<br>floras<br>become homogenized so it's that global<br>homogenization<br>and the outcome of this is a shift away<br>from treating biodiversity<br>as only being about species richness so<br>as a trivial example here we've got four<br>islands<br>they have a total down there at the<br>bottom of 26 species native to them<br>each only found on that island five<br>introduced species are introduced to<br>this archipelago<br>uh three on the second island and five<br>on the third<br>three on the the fourth island we lose<br>three species one<br>and one so we've had five extinctions so<br>in total we still have 26 species in<br>this archipelago so you might think<br>biodiversity has been<br>uh conserved but actually we've lost uh<br>five species uniquely from the world and<br>uh haven't gained any more because it's<br>species that already existed<br>somewhere else so some of the methods we<br>might use to restore these islands<br>on the first one and the fourth one we<br>might protect the first one<br>as a pristine island that has no<br>introduced species<br>that fourth one only has three<br>introduced species we might eradicate<br>them<br>and restore the island so undisturbed<br>natural habitat remains only in small<br>pockets<br>restoration efforts are successful on<br>those small uninhabited offshore islands<br>for eradications plantings<br>and reintroductions of lost species<br>the second island has three introduced<br>species<br>and it might have some novel ecosystems<br>so as a result of former land use<br>novel ecosystems develop you get mixed<br>species compositions of native and<br>non-native species<br>and decisions around management of these<br>novel ecosystems include a large values<br>component about who values the native<br>species<br>versus the role of those introduced or<br>exotic species whether they're seen as<br>positive or negative<br>to the ecosystem uh the final island is<br>the third one this might be more of a<br>cultural landscape<br>native biodiversity persists across the<br>cultural landscape<br>subtle changes in the management and<br>behavior promote it but we've got to<br>build this upon local knowledge<br>culture and sovereignty of that island<br>and here we see the full picture of<br>biodiversity it's not just about species<br>there's genetic biodiversity<br>species biodiversity functional<br>biodiversity<br>and habitat biodiversity and in the<br>bottom there you can see how species<br>biodiversity is structured into that<br>alpha biodiversity on the island<br>the beta biodiversity which is the<br>differences among islands and the gamma<br>biodiversity which is the total<br>biodiversity across all islands<br>so finally i come around to philosophy<br>and ask questions such as how do we<br>balance the welfare of individuals um<br>individuals rights uh not to suffer or<br>endure pain against higher levels of<br>ecological organizations such as the<br>populations and species that<br>conservation biology is trying to<br>conserve<br>the method here is a typical<br>philosophical one of thinking and<br>debating<br>and the result was an argument for<br>one-off lethal control of an introduced<br>population to save a population or<br>species would be a valid<br>approach in conservation and the outcome<br>is we have a moral position stated<br>for introduced predator eradication on<br>islands<br>so here this brings me to predator-free<br>new zealand where i've focused my<br>efforts for the last five years<br>in 1963 when big south cape island was<br>invaded<br>half a percent of our offshore island<br>area was predator free<br>if you fast forward 50 years we've<br>eradicated rats from a third of the<br>islands of new zealand<br>but only the small islands 10 percent of<br>island area is predator free in 2014<br>still something to be quite proud of but<br>there's still a lot more we could do on<br>our islands 50 percent of island area<br>could be predator free by 2030<br>if we eradicated predators from these<br>large inhabited islands<br>of ayatia great barrier island and<br>rakiora stuart island<br>and then if we look to the mainland we<br>see that 45<br>of new zealand is actually currently<br>under some form of predator management<br>not just for biodiversity but for<br>agricultural practice<br>a lot of areas where possums musculars<br>and rodents are being monitored and<br>controlled to some degree<br>but how many of those sites have<br>predator control to that gold standard<br>of island eradication<br>the answer is in our 50 eco sanctuaries<br>but they make up only a quarter of a<br>percent of the mainland area<br>of new zealand so there's a lot more we<br>could do to restore new zealand to its<br>former glory<br>as an island seabird bird capital<br>of the world so i think<br>uh on this journey i've still got many<br>more tools to find in my swiss army<br>knife<br>the full conservation swiss army knife i<br>think will be a very<br>big and cumbersome tool like this which<br>requires not just myself but the many<br>others that come<br>after me to find their swiss army knife<br>tools<br>and to use those i want to thank the<br>many many groups that have funded me to<br>enable me to achieve this<br>research i especially want to thank the<br>many many many people that i've had the<br>pleasure<br>of collaborating with and i am<br>absolutely blessed to be honest that<br>none of them<br>has ever been anything more than a joy<br>to work with and created amazing results<br>that have helped<br>continue to jettison new zealand to<br>greater conservation<br>achievements i want to thank my fan now<br>who are absolutely motivating and joyful<br>to<br>live with and be with and to share my<br>conservation with but to provide a break<br>from it<br>as well i'd like to dedicate this talk<br>to my father who sadly passed away six<br>months ago<br>tonight who was a great man and just did<br>his best<br>to support me and sharing me that<br>enthusiasm for working<br>uh with birds so thank you very much i'm<br>happy to take any questions<br>and this is a website where you can<br>learn more about the island conservation<br>work we do at the university of auckland<br>thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
