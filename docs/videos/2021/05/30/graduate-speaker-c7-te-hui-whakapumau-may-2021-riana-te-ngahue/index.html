found out that i was going after<br>the<br>sir doctor the honourable justice joe<br>williams so<br>i would like to acknowledge all the<br>whanau members and friends that have<br>traveled to be here today to celebrate<br>our graduates<br>your support has been a massive factor<br>in the success of the graduate in your<br>whanau<br>whether the support looked like<br>financial support care packages<br>having a quality cooked meal at home in<br>the breaks or just being on the other<br>end of the phone when things got a bit<br>overwhelming or stressful<br>thank you i would like to specifically<br>acknowledge my nan<br>she's the only of my four grandparents<br>still here with me today so it's really<br>special to me that she came all the way<br>from<br>hoya country in little old partier i<br>always promised her that when she made<br>it down here i'd take her to the club so<br>i would like to acknowledge all of the<br>important people to us who weren't able<br>to be here today<br>are tinana but without a doubt they're<br>here with us today our waidua<br>te fari wananga congratulations you<br>should be incredibly proud of yourself<br>all of your whanau and your ewe and your<br>tipuna proud of you<br>um<br>there's two key lessons that i've<br>learned here that i'd like to share<br>and they're linked to the two highlights<br>of my experience at university<br>the context of my first is that when i<br>started university i was incredibly shy<br>particularly in my tedious classes and i<br>sat silent in class for the majority of<br>my first two and a half years<br>i dreaded being asked a question or<br>having to do group work or anything like<br>that<br>just out of fear and shame of having to<br>speak my classmates were supportive and<br>help me understand instructions but i<br>felt like i wasn't really making any<br>progress<br>and constantly felt inadequate my<br>highlight is the first time that i<br>voluntarily answered a question in class<br>it was my third year and it was in dr<br>karina kelly's class<br>and i remember it being one of the first<br>times i felt like i was kind of<br>following what was going on in class<br>i can't remember the question but i<br>waited and waited for somebody to answer<br>and no one did<br>so i tentatively put my hand up ready to<br>snatch it back down<br>i answered the class in cardinal with a<br>little or possibly a lot of mask<br>disbelief<br>went quiet and<br>at that moment the whole class started<br>clapping for me probably out of shock<br>my language is my awakening my language<br>is the window to my soul<br>as i said at the beginning of my speech<br>interior i sat inside of our farenui on<br>the brink of tears<br>countless times during the start of my<br>deal journey and it was difficult and it<br>felt<br>endless and i was ashamed and just<br>wanted to stop turning up<br>but that's what unpacking<br>intergenerational whakama looks like<br>and it's never going to be easy but it's<br>always going to be worth it<br>so to my fellow graduates those who<br>haven't found the right way to delve<br>into te reo yet<br>um find it it is the wahara to tell<br>maori and if i could get past the deep<br>inherent shame<br>then you can as well my second highlight<br>is my moot interior<br>a moot is essentially a mock trial<br>competition and you have to defend or<br>prosecute a case in front of a panel of<br>judges<br>including justice joe in that year i<br>regretted signing up to the competition<br>in te reo<br>every moment up until it was over and<br>then justice joe started grilling me on<br>my legal arguments i was like<br>but it's now one of my proudest<br>it was also the first time that my dad<br>had seen me speak to um he's now deep<br>into his own tedious journey and i<br>couldn't be prouder<br>which essentially means feel the fear<br>and do it anyway<br>i think that this ties in well with<br>where we're all heading in our careers<br>we've been privileged enough to get a<br>tertiary education which opens a lot of<br>doorways into different spaces for us<br>lots of these spaces have had maori and<br>pakia academics<br>at pacifica sorry also fighting for<br>recognition for a long time<br>from what i've seen it feels like a lot<br>of these industries are now realizing<br>that we as maori<br>and pacifica have an entirely different<br>skill set and world view<br>on top of being successful in a<br>mainstream institution such as this one<br>and that this is extremely valuable we<br>have the maori health authority the<br>beginning of the fusing of tikanga maori<br>in the common law<br>maori values becoming a focal point in<br>resource management<br>maori mps backing the colonial status<br>quo and<br>winning and just across the board a real<br>recognition of the value of our systems<br>i'm not sure if it's just me but that<br>feels kind of scary to me that these<br>champions of tell maori have been<br>fighting<br>and creating these solutions for us for<br>so long and we're entering our careers<br>at a time<br>where great possibly flawless<br>implementation and execution is<br>necessary<br>but even though it may be daunting to<br>fits<br>because it's never going to be easy but<br>it's always going to be worth it and so<br>much of the hard part has already been<br>done<br>so to my fellow graduates be proud of<br>how hard you've worked to get to this<br>position<br>recognize and appreciate the multiple<br>skill sets that you have<br>celebrate your achievements and<br>celebrate those people who are your po<br>po dinaki or pillars of support<br>koto</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
