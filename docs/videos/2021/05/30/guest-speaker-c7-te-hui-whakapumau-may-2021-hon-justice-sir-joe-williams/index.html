whether<br>a couple of you rushed<br>some of you had so much whakapapa it<br>took the entire walk from there to here<br>some of you got big cheers and i thought<br>well they must be popular<br>then i thought probably not it's just<br>their parents whanau and mates are<br>relieved<br>this is an important time for you a<br>really important time<br>as we confront as a world and as a<br>country<br>some of the greatest challenges our<br>species<br>has ever confronted whether we'll<br>survive<br>whether we can finally shrug off<br>the hangover of colonization<br>and find a different way<br>that tracks a path that no one's ever<br>so many other things that i'm not going<br>to list them because i'll forget<br>something<br>you came to a university which i guess<br>was called victoria when you arrived<br>and that kind of underscores that<br>colonization story i mean it is victoria<br>she was the other side of the treaty in<br>1840<br>and of course we dress up like this<br>i got an honorary doctorate from tawa<br>nuyarangi<br>tewanangawa yarangi which is why<br>interestingly it's a tribal one but i<br>and all of those people look like my<br>courtiers<br>to remind us there are some valuable<br>some approaches to knowledge systems of<br>that are going to be quite useful to us<br>to you and<br>when i came through this place that was<br>all we got<br>not a korowai to be seen<br>i was thinking to myself as i was<br>watching this process go on what's<br>changed<br>in the yes 35 years since i came through<br>this place<br>35 years<br>and you know what i noticed the<br>way in the room the mataura<br>the number of kahu huruhuru<br>the number of korowai the number of<br>hieke<br>here<br>i expect they're right victoria's<br>probably no longer<br>a good name for this place it's missing<br>something important<br>i must say i do mourn for the numbers of<br>chickens and pheasants<br>that have given up their lives for this<br>but we are at the fulcrum point of<br>change and you represent it<br>not just in what you've studied and in<br>the fact that you've chosen the maori<br>graduation<br>but in what you wear in the way you<br>present yourselves<br>in the way your wha know your hapu and<br>your eewee get up<br>how can new zealanders of any stripe<br>not feel pride and belonging<br>in watching this process go on<br>because you know when i was your age<br>you could be forgiven for believing<br>that all terroir was floating somewhere<br>in the mid-atlantic<br>when i was a child we had to stand up at<br>the movies<br>because the first thing that happened<br>was they played god save the queen that<br>is a world<br>you people can't possibly imagine<br>yesterday<br>i think we are on<br>the most important journey we will ever<br>be on<br>as a country we are heading<br>south from the atlantic to the pacific<br>at last and we are coming to discover<br>that we are a polynesian country<br>and we are polynesians<br>and that will save us<br>from the hangover of the last 200 years<br>and it'll set us in a strong position<br>for these existential challenges that we<br>will face<br>i know this to be true because the rest<br>of the world is looking at us<br>little old altar for answers<br>with the ability as we keep challenging<br>ourselves to do<br>to synthesize and blend the west<br>and the pacific to find new ways of<br>thinking<br>new ways of doing new ways of being<br>if we can do that here<br>have no doubt the world will follow<br>you see the graduation that i went to<br>was siloed<br>you got your bas then your bscs<br>then your bcas and<br>your llbs often on different nights<br>because the genius of western knowledge<br>is to silo<br>to fragment to break down and to analyze<br>every tiny little part<br>so that universities became places where<br>you got to know<br>more and more about less and less until<br>the journey this university is on<br>is to reverse that<br>to break down walls and to talk about as<br>we heard from the<br>ecosystem science and ecosystem tikanga<br>the blending of those two things<br>produces answers<br>that are superior to the separating<br>and fragmenting of those two things in<br>accordance with<br>the approach of western science now what<br>i<br>i don't for a moment wish to set aside<br>western science<br>it can be incredibly helpful<br>but there has always been a layer<br>missing<br>and you all of you are<br>weaving that layer back in<br>that's your contribution<br>to altera and to the planet<br>and i'm sorry we lay this burden on you<br>i'm very sorry we've had to lay this<br>burden on you<br>but having watched you graduate and<br>having seen the support of your whanau<br>your hapu and your iwi<br>having seen how much your staff are<br>proud of what you've done<br>i couldn't possibly be more confident<br>that you are the ones for this job<br>i couldn't be more confident so<br>victoria university becomes the heading<br>awaka<br>who would have thought the um someone<br>said that they're heading<br>waka marai was uh opened in 1986<br>not true the herengoku model was opened<br>in 1980<br>it was the old chaplaincy building and<br>we chucked some carvings up on it<br>and called it a maori space that was the<br>beginning once<br>that was done the ambition grew and grew<br>and grew 1986 the new fire was built<br>2023 we have the living power<br>hopefully and the living power<br>is the very embodiment of this idea that<br>i was talking about<br>apar a maori space<br>not just for the maoris but for the<br>lawyers<br>the scientists the doctors the<br>architects the engineers<br>all to come and learn and draw from the<br>wisdom of tao maori<br>where silos are broken down because a<br>culture<br>that believes in fanongatanga to its<br>very core<br>hates division and loves only connection<br>the living power is kind of a<br>culmination of the ideas<br>you guys have been working on in your<br>studies<br>and it i believe maybe i'm not objective<br>because this is my university<br>because ironically interestingly<br>surprisingly the breaking down of silos<br>walls and barriers<br>is a revolutionary idea in western<br>knowledge<br>even if it's as old as kupe in chicago<br>so<br>the decolonization story starts<br>when we go like this<br>and make stronger<br>what was not as strong separately and<br>foreign<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
