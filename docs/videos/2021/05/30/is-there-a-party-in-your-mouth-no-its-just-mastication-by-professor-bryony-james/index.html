But Professor Bryony James’ work has traversed aluminium smelting to chocolate melting, with wine proteins and pizza cheese in between.<br><br>Now Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research at the University of Waikato, Professor James first pivoted from the science of hard materials by impulsively analysing the microstructure of an apple in a scanning electron microscope.<br><br>She went on to join the dots from the microstructure of food to its mechanical properties and how they interact with oral processes when we eat, using gel-based model foods to ascertain how we chew different kinds of textures and the results on our appetites.<br><br>In this lecture, Professor James will outline her journey from materials engineering to food oral processing, and explain how the textural complexity of food may have a relationship with our feelings of fullness after eating, and where this area of work is headed

a certain<br>form and transition and usually build to<br>a sentimental crescendo where you thank<br>your loved ones<br>for their support over the years i'm<br>going to have to flip that around<br>and thank my loved ones first because if<br>i do it the other way around i will<br>reduce myself to tears<br>lose all credibility and my make-up will<br>run<br>so i would like to first thank my<br>parents<br>they can't be here tonight because they<br>are off pursuing their mission to<br>single-handedly resurrect the new<br>zealand tourism<br>sector and and also i'd like to thank my<br>partner helen who also can't be here<br>tonight because she put it i can listen<br>to you talk anytime<br>but my my thanks for their support is no<br>less heartfelt<br>for that and without them i obviously<br>it was pretty well fated that i was<br>going to be an engineer<br>everybody here probably went through<br>that exercise at primary school where<br>you had to describe what you were going<br>to be when you grew up<br>some people might say i'm still waiting<br>to grow up but but back then<br>um i i did my duty now in in the class<br>everybody else wanted to be either a<br>farmer<br>or a farmer's wife this was a small<br>rural community in the 1970s<br>i on the other hand wanted to be a shop<br>steward<br>which horrified my parents but what i<br>actually meant was captain peacock in<br>are you being served<br>but i also wanted to in my spare time<br>make crazy contraptions<br>i wanted to invent a big wheel of sick<br>bag and an umbrella and the complete<br>lack of punctuation in that sentence<br>makes it unclear<br>whether this was a single invention or<br>three separate ones<br>suggesting also that i was destined to<br>end up in universities<br>which are great shelters<br>for those of us of a more innovative<br>bend<br>i started my journey in cornwall and of<br>course cornwall's great contribution to<br>the world is the cornish pasty<br>now that begs the question why did i<br>ever end up in food research because if<br>there's one item of food that can in no<br>way be improved upon it is the cordish<br>pasting<br>from cornwall i moved up to peterborough<br>to work for a company called apv baker<br>and then from there it went to the<br>university of bath to pursue a degree in<br>mechanical engineering<br>and much as i pursued it it got away<br>from me i only<br>lasted three weeks in mechanical<br>engineering uh realizing it wasn't for<br>me<br>after all but after a few drinks in the<br>bar i discovered a different discipline<br>materials science and engineering and<br>once i<br>changed my degree i absolutely fell in<br>love with the topic<br>and didn't want to stop at the end of my<br>undergraduate degree i wanted to<br>continue studying material science and<br>engineering<br>and so i wrote to every single<br>english-speaking university in the whole<br>world excluding america<br>and said i would like to come and do a<br>phd and every last one of them wrote<br>back<br>and said certainly come our overseas<br>fees are<br>insert eye watering figure here apart<br>from this chap<br>barry welch from the university of<br>auckland who wrote back and said<br>oh yes there's this problem with<br>overseas fees but we'll find a way<br>around that<br>i'm going to be in london next week you<br>want to meet for coffee<br>and as it turns out barry's entire<br>recruiting strategy for his research<br>group<br>was anybody who was deaf enough to ride<br>a motorbike from birth to london in the<br>middle of winter<br>for a half hour coffee in mcdonald's<br>so a few months later i started my phd<br>at the university of auckland and as<br>with any phd it was completely<br>straightforward no ups and downs<br>whatsoever<br>and after the requisite amount of time i<br>got the most important part of a phd<br>which is the floppy hat<br>now the thing about phds is that they<br>fit you with a world of skills not just<br>in what you researched<br>and so you're faced at graduation with a<br>whole bunch of different options<br>where you could go next now of course my<br>options have finally led me here to the<br>university of waikato<br>and the deputy vice chancellor research<br>role which as a job is more fun than a<br>barrel of monkeys<br>there's no two ways about it but the<br>thing about a dvcr's role<br>is that it is all about other people's<br>research<br>and for tonight and tonight only i'm<br>going to be utterly self-indulgent<br>and just talk about my research<br>my phd was in aluminium smelting<br>and at the conclusion of that phd i was<br>offered a job at the bell bay smelter in<br>tasmania<br>luckily i was also offered a job running<br>the research center for surface and<br>materials science at the university of<br>auckland which seemed at the time like a<br>lot more fun<br>not least because it came with a role as<br>lecturer in the department of chemical<br>and materials engineering<br>and much as i won't speak about it<br>tonight teaching<br>what i worked out over the years is<br>about 15 000 engineers<br>has possibly been the highlight of my<br>career<br>it also meant i had to develop my own<br>research career and i went from<br>aluminium smelting into surface<br>engineering<br>thermal spray coatings the the role of<br>of<br>research symptoms surface and material<br>science meant i got to collaborate with<br>a really wide number of people<br>this is a picture of a hard to remove<br>catheter which is probably as<br>uncomfortable<br>as it sounds collaborating with people<br>from the med school i collaborated with<br>geologists and did a bit of mineralogy<br>a lot of natural fiber research this is<br>possum fur<br>i worked on wood fibre composites with<br>the forest research institute now known<br>as scion<br>and flakes of paint so many flakes of<br>paint<br>paint from old mazdas paint from old<br>masters i looked at every<br>sort of paint what this really<br>illustrates<br>is admittedly i was casting around<br>somewhat<br>i was trying to find my research niche<br>and i was having a bit of difficulty so<br>one evening<br>late i was eating my apples sitting at<br>my desk working away<br>and somebody that day had left the<br>scanning electron microscopes set<br>up for what's called cryo sem or low<br>temperature sem<br>which is what you use for looking at<br>hydrated specimens in the microscope<br>so what do you do you've got an apple<br>you've got a million dollar microscope<br>it's obvious so i pop some of my apple<br>into the microscope to have a look at<br>look at what it was and this is this is<br>what an apple looks like a massive<br>magnification<br>which i thought was kind of cool um but<br>didn't really think anything more of it<br>until a few days later this wonderful<br>and bronwyn smith who's sadly no longer<br>with us but she was a senior lecturer in<br>food science at the university of<br>auckland<br>and she started to describe to me what<br>all the bits of this apple were<br>and she talked about the cell walls and<br>the polysaccharides gluing the cells<br>together<br>and as she spoke the structure and how<br>the material behaved<br>began to come clear in my mind so so<br>um as a little experiment imagine if you<br>would<br>taking a a ripe apple very pinnacle of<br>ripeness<br>and as you bite into it your teeth<br>deform<br>the apple cells the parenchyma cells<br>they're basically just little<br>juice-filled balloons that are all glued<br>together<br>and the glue is quite strong in a ripe<br>apple so what happens is this<br>your teeth deform the cells until<br>finally they rupture<br>so what you experience is the noise of<br>the rupture and that explosion of juice<br>you're going to interpret this apple as<br>crisp and juicy<br>now if you left that apple alone for<br>three or four weeks or started with<br>another apple<br>and bit into that one well as apples go<br>past the point of perfect ripeness that<br>glue between the cells starts to break<br>down<br>so what happens is this the cells when<br>you bite down on them instead come apart<br>in your mouth<br>so instead of experiencing this apple as<br>crisp and juicy it tastes<br>dry and flowery even though it might<br>have exactly the same amount of juice in<br>it<br>now once bronwyn was done explaining all<br>of this to me the dye was cast<br>i was no longer a materials engineer<br>i was a food materials engineer<br>now any engineering colleagues in the<br>room know fine well that the holy<br>trinity<br>of materials engineering is the<br>relationship between processing<br>which changes structure which changes<br>properties<br>now in the traditional materials science<br>that structure might be something like<br>the grain size of a metal in food<br>material science and engineering that<br>might be something like air cells in an<br>apple<br>or ice crystals in ice cream the<br>processing roots in food engineering<br>might be natural roots like ripening or<br>they might be cooking or freezing<br>and the properties instead of the<br>strength and toughness of traditional<br>materials engineering well we still care<br>about strength and toughness actually<br>but we interpret them differently<br>as things like food texture and taste<br>and aroma and functionality<br>and i think it's fair to say over the<br>years i've messed around on every point<br>of that triangle<br>but for this evening i'm just going to<br>speak about this one<br>uh texture or mouth feel how the food<br>feels in your mouth now the challenge of<br>studying texture<br>is incredibly important as a food<br>property but it's one we generally don't<br>think about very much<br>so again i'm going to ask you to indulge<br>in a little experiment and ask<br>yourselves i won't ask for a show of<br>hands that's just embarrassing<br>ask yourselves which of these two corn<br>chips is going to taste better<br>or this one okay<br>like i say i'm not going to ask for a<br>show of hands inevitably everyone's<br>going to say the corn chip on the left<br>will taste better<br>but actually both those corn chips are<br>going to taste exactly the same<br>the question that you've actually<br>answered to yourself is a question<br>relating to how they're going to feel to<br>food texture<br>and as the mother of food texture maria<br>sezniac<br>said back in the early 70s textures<br>taken for granted we generally only<br>notice it when it's wrong<br>now this illustrates an interesting<br>point about research we're never<br>completely alone<br>we always build our research on the<br>research that has come<br>before us and for me looking at food<br>oral processing or chewing<br>as we normally know it one of the most<br>important founders of this science was<br>this chap<br>oh here we go again this chat horace<br>fletcher<br>now horace fletcher was an american and<br>and in the late<br>1800s i i stretched to call him a<br>nutritionist<br>but but only because i'm calling him an<br>eccentric quack would be slightly rude<br>he had a theory that you should chew<br>every mouthful of food<br>100 times for a long and healthful life<br>chew every mouthful of food including<br>liquids 100 times he in fact coined the<br>term<br>nature will castigate those who don't<br>masticate<br>and he ended up with the nickname the<br>great masticator<br>which i am deeply jealous of uh<br>he also died a millionaire which just<br>goes to show really doesn't it<br>um but the funny thing is old horus old<br>horus was onto something<br>it sounds a bit silly now but we'll come<br>back to that<br>in just a moment now i could not have<br>picked a better time to stumble into<br>food materials engineering<br>because at that time this chat marco<br>morgenstern of planting food research<br>which was then crop and food research<br>was getting together a crew to chase<br>some money<br>to look at how food structure influenced<br>food texture<br>and we were fortunate enough to land a<br>fairly large program that supported<br>a multi-disciplinary cross university<br>team for five years<br>as we created what was called the food<br>structure platform<br>and we looked at all sorts of foods and<br>had a lot of people chew them up this is<br>a set of biscuits<br>my phd students in this period spent a<br>lot of time asking people to chew food<br>and spit it out<br>and i told them i didn't want to see the<br>results but they shared them with me so<br>i'm sharing them with you<br>and of course the challenging thing<br>about studying how you chew food is that<br>ideally it happens in a closed mouth we<br>don't really want to see it<br>so you have to use a bunch of techniques<br>to figure out what's going on and one of<br>the technique<br>techniques we used was a technique<br>called temporal dominance of sensation<br>or tds now i'm not going to go into<br>detail about tds but in a nutshell<br>you've got a panel of people and you<br>give them some food and they<br>take a bite of the food and as they chew<br>it they select from a list of textures<br>in this case<br>which texture is dominating their<br>attention at any given time<br>so with those biscuits they might select<br>crunchy and then as they carry on it<br>might become<br>bitty or crumbly and finely soft and<br>sticky<br>and so it gives you the the the temporal<br>change in how texture<br>evolves now the reason i didn't label<br>any of these lines is because what you<br>do is you take all of the<br>the data and you lump them together you<br>get this consensus and<br>every tds plot you ever see looks just<br>like this<br>what it tells you is at the start of<br>chewing at the start of oral processing<br>everybody's agreeing in this case if<br>this was the biscuits that blue line<br>might be a texture like crunchy<br>everybody's agreeing the biscuits are<br>crunchy at the end of oral processing<br>again<br>everybody's agreeing they're saying<br>maybe that green line is soft or sticky<br>everybody's agreeing saying it's soft<br>and sticky but in between<br>times you've got all this sort of<br>chaotic stuff happening<br>and this got me thinking about the<br>complexity of texture<br>and and how we perceive that issue of<br>texture and that was useful because what<br>i really wanted to answer one question<br>was how does<br>texture influence satiation and satiety<br>now just to get our terminology quite<br>clear here satiation is that whole<br>um selection of signals that tells you<br>that you're full so it brings a meal to<br>a close<br>satiety is the period that you go before<br>you're hungry again<br>so satiation your full satiety is how<br>long you're full<br>for now a lot of people have looked at<br>the impact of texture on satiation<br>and without fail they've found that<br>there is some impact but this is how it<br>often works<br>excuse me say they're looking at yogurt<br>they take a thin yogurt and a thick<br>creamy yogurt<br>the thick creamy yogurt makes people<br>feel fuller sooner<br>but the thick creamy yogurt also takes<br>longer<br>to travel through the oral cavity your<br>oral processing time is longer<br>and without fail when you look at all<br>the studies on association<br>they've found that the longer you take<br>to chew something the sooner you'll feel<br>full<br>so this brings us back to old horus he<br>was on to something because the longer<br>you choose something for<br>the sooner you'll feel full turns out my<br>great auntie weedo was also under the<br>same thing she always ticked me off<br>reading too fast<br>so what i wanted to answer though<br>instead of chewing time is there just an<br>impact of texture<br>does it have an impact on satiation<br>irrespective of how long you're going to<br>choose something for<br>now when we were exploring this question<br>i was very lucky at the time to have an<br>excellent postdoc called danny larson<br>and a very good phd student called jin<br>yang tang<br>and they developed these model foods<br>based on a gel a gelatin a agar gel<br>they're little bite-sized pieces<br>and they put all these inclusions into<br>them like ground up poppy seeds for a<br>gritty sensation or sunflower seeds for<br>a hard sensation<br>and we created these models that were<br>low complexity or high complexity and<br>the important thing because these were<br>little bite-sized pieces<br>they all took about the same length of<br>time to chew there was no significant<br>difference in the chewing behavior<br>between the low<br>complexity and the high complexity so<br>then we ran some satiation trials now<br>these little things<br>they weren't terrible but they weren't<br>nice enough to eat a whole meal of even<br>for undergraduates<br>so what we did was something called a<br>preload trial<br>and we recruited a lot of people and we<br>gave them a little starter of three of<br>these little pieces<br>and then we fed them a meal an ad<br>libertarian meal eat as much as you like<br>meal first course was pasta and tomato<br>sauce and the instruction was to eat as<br>much as you possibly can<br>infinite refills keep eating and signal<br>when you cannot eat another bite<br>then we offered them chocolate cake and<br>without fail everybody ate another bite<br>several bites in some cases and then we<br>weighed how much people had eaten<br>and what we saw was that anybody who had<br>had the high complexity starter<br>went on to eat less of the meal than<br>anyone with the low complexity starter<br>that happened across two different<br>panels with two different sets of model<br>food<br>we were pretty excited about this not<br>least because when we questioned people<br>throughout the whole process<br>they never felt any different so this<br>was totally unconscious<br>that begs the question why and everybody<br>any any researchers here know that when<br>you've got a question why where'd you go<br>you go to the master and fund<br>so we went to the marston fund and i was<br>lucky to grab a couple of chums to take<br>along with me michael houtis who's a<br>psychologist<br>he specializes in something called<br>psychophysics and nicholas gant who's a<br>sports scientist but he<br>focuses on something on neuroimaging<br>and the question we wanted to answer was<br>which bit of this whole<br>complex of hormones and neurological<br>signals in your mind<br>which part of that we're influencing<br>were we just you know confusing your<br>brain<br>were we just doing a horus and saying<br>this is so horrible to chew i'm going to<br>stop<br>now we didn't know we still don't know<br>we haven't finished sorry about that<br>i'll leave you hanging on that one<br>you'll have to come back for<br>my next inaugural lecture um<br>part of the problem is we're still<br>trying to answer the question what do we<br>mean by<br>food texture what do we mean by food<br>textural complexity<br>now michael's doing a great job and<br>beginning to tease this apart from a<br>psychological perspective but part of<br>the problem<br>is i'm sure you already have an idea in<br>your head what i mean when i say that<br>because it's a little bit like<br>justice potter stewart said he coined<br>the immortal phrase i can't<br>define it but i know it when i see it<br>now of course he was talking about<br>pornography<br>but the same thing applies to food<br>textual complexity<br>so i thought well let's start with the<br>simpler food and and go from there<br>so i decided to look at chocolate<br>because why not<br>and i was foolish enough to say to some<br>of my friends at the nestle<br>research center in switzerland that i<br>was going to quantify<br>the oral processing of chocolate and<br>they giggled in a<br>slightly embarrassed fashion and changed<br>the<br>um subject began to realize why after a<br>while but still i thought it was a bit<br>pessimistic of them<br>and as an engineer i wouldn't wouldn't<br>be allowed to give a presentation<br>without having an equation in here<br>and so i have described the oral<br>processing of chocolate in a single<br>mathematical model and for the first<br>time in public<br>so as as it turns out you know chocolate<br>isn't particularly simple at all<br>um here's what it looks like this is a<br>confocal laser scanning microscope image<br>of dark chocolate<br>so so for my materials engineering<br>colleagues in the audience chocolate is<br>a<br>multi-scale meta-stable polymorphic<br>semi-solid<br>you know it's it's not simple um anybody<br>else just just look at the picture it's<br>cool<br>but the yellow stuff here is the fat<br>phase that's the cocoa butter<br>but the black is the particulate face<br>that's the sugar<br>and the blue that's the other<br>particulate face that's the cocoa nibs<br>and this is just dark chocolate this is<br>whitaker's ghana if you're interested<br>so imagine taking this and putting it in<br>your mouth and beginning to oral process<br>it<br>what happens well for a start you start<br>adding body heat<br>so the fat phase begins to melt then you<br>start to add some saliva so you create<br>what's called an emulsion<br>and the first emulsion that you create<br>is a continuous fat phase with droplets<br>of saliva in it<br>but then as your tongue continues to mix<br>it and you continue to add saliva<br>you end up going through what's called<br>phase inversion and the whole thing<br>flips around<br>and you end up with a continuous phase<br>of saliva with droplets of fat in it<br>now that influences all of those<br>structural changes<br>influence how you perceive the texture<br>of the chocolate and how you perceive<br>the flavor of the chocolate<br>but things get more complicated because<br>whenever you're thinking about texture<br>perception or flavor perception<br>it occurs at the intersection of the<br>product and the person<br>we're pretty good at making food<br>products we've been doing it for a very<br>long time<br>we're getting pretty good now at<br>understanding the microstructure of<br>those food products this again is a<br>spat out full of chocolate and then we<br>take these<br>incredibly carefully manufactured<br>structures and we give them to people<br>and the way you perceive texture<br>will change as your age changes the way<br>you perceive texture will change<br>depending on where you come from and<br>there's an emerging body of<br>theory that suggests uh that we each<br>have our own<br>innate oral processing strategy we each<br>tend to chew things or tend to suck<br>things and people refer to this as mouth<br>behavior<br>so this sounded like a fun area to<br>explore<br>so uh one of my phd students who's just<br>finished and gone back to china actually<br>then they he recruited 300 people<br>fairly easy to do when you're going to<br>feed them chocolate and he gave him<br>chocolate<br>and he watched how they ate it and what<br>he found was you could mostly group<br>people into people who sucked their<br>chocolate<br>people who chewed their chocolate and<br>the slightly awkward ones in between<br>which we won't talk about tonight<br>and the suckers and the chewers got to<br>about the same sort of structure of that<br>chewed up mouthful of chocolate<br>which we talked about before they all<br>got to the same end point a continuous<br>saliva phase with droplets of fat in it<br>but the route they took to get there<br>changed on whether they were sucking or<br>chewing they went through a whole bunch<br>of different<br>intermediate structures we threw a bit<br>of flavoring into the chocolate we<br>chucked in a taste stunt we added some<br>menthol<br>we invented mint chocolate yeah you go<br>us<br>um and and we looked at the impact of<br>the chewing behavior<br>on on how our participants<br>experienced the flavor and the chewers<br>get this really fast and really high hit<br>of menthol that goes away just as<br>quickly and it's all over<br>the suckers take a lot longer to get to<br>where they're going<br>they don't reach the highest of highs<br>but they perceive that menthol<br>for a lot longer this could easily be a<br>comment on people's personality<br>but it is a comment on their chewing<br>behavior<br>now whenever as i put my dvcr hat back<br>on briefly<br>as dvcr when i get out and speak to our<br>researchers here at waikato which is one<br>of the great perks of my job to be<br>honest<br>i love hearing from people how they want<br>their research to change the world<br>and everybody does it's why you go into<br>research but some people know<br>that that change is going to happen<br>immediately and some people know that<br>change is going to happen in the far<br>distant future<br>but that's what research is about it's<br>about changing the world<br>so what does this research do to change<br>the world or the near future things<br>is fairly apparent from this if you want<br>to deliver say a functional ingredient<br>say omega-3 fish oil and you wanted to<br>use chocolate to deliver it<br>well would people taste the fishiness we<br>can begin to answer that question<br>by understanding how people chew their<br>chocolate<br>but what's the what's the longer goal<br>for this sort of research<br>well i'll finish up with this idea<br>can we design different foods for<br>different consumers<br>yes why would we want to well if we come<br>back to<br>some of our older consumers as you age<br>there's good things about aging but some<br>of the less good things is things like<br>your bite force<br>decreases your salivary flow rate<br>changes<br>sometimes it's difficult to swallow and<br>one of the things that many<br>of our most elderly consumers experience<br>is a lack of pleasure<br>in their food if you go to any rest home<br>meal time is almost definitely<br>silent because people are concentrating<br>really hard<br>on safe swallowing and chewing things<br>there's no fun<br>in that my dad who can't be here tonight<br>he loves a crisp crunchy apple he can no<br>more bite into a crisp crunchy apple<br>then you can be here tonight<br>so so what can we do to understand that<br>and give people<br>back that pleasure in eating<br>so one of my phd students who's just<br>finishing up at the moment<br>she recruited a whole ton of people and<br>she divided them by age and she gave<br>them these model foods<br>their gelatin gels soft medium hard<br>measured their bite force<br>and asked them what's too hard for you<br>and again we're still<br>teasing apart what this means but<br>imagine where this might lead<br>could we design foods that for most of<br>us would be<br>a bit ho-hum but for some of our older<br>consumers would give them back<br>crunchy chewy textures that they've had<br>to step away from<br>so i'm going to stop there with two more<br>things that are absolutely vital to you<br>as a researcher now i'm blessed that my<br>research discipline<br>engineering research is a team sport and<br>i wouldn't have been able to achieve<br>any of this without my phd students so<br>this is some of them here<br>this is some of the people who produced<br>the work you saw tonight and i'm<br>endlessly grateful<br>and it is a huge privilege to supervise<br>them equally it would be most remiss of<br>me not to acknowledge the people who<br>funded this research<br>over the years both external funders and<br>the universities that have supported me<br>so with that it just remains to say<br>uh<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
