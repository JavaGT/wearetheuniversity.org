of you joining<br>us on zoom we hope the connection<br>is stable and good it is<br>my pleasure to welcome everybody to this<br>first of our<br>new seminar series sessions where<br>prime which is something that sits<br>within the faculty<br>hosts a range of different speakers<br>through the sorry i'll just turn down<br>the<br>speakers a little bit um through the<br>year<br>and we turn this the<br>and i need to turn down that speed a<br>little bit<br>oh geez what's that<br>good right no michael right apologies<br>for that which we<br>call the funded chair series on<br>sustainable development<br>and it's our pleasure to have our first<br>speaker today<br>professor sia hua ang who will be<br>speaking<br>to building sustainable ecosystems<br>through the nexus of quality education<br>and decent work and economic growth and<br>those of you familiar with the sdgs will<br>already pick out that there are<br>two prominent sdgs in there i<br>before i hand over to professor<br>um i would like to just give a little<br>bit of context<br>to this seminar series<br>because prime is hosting it so i think<br>there's some value in explaining briefly<br>what<br>prime is it's a it's an initiative that<br>exists within business schools<br>it is powered so to speak by the united<br>nations<br>and prime is the principle of<br>responsible management education<br>and as you can see here in its in its<br>mission<br>it's about transforming management<br>education so business schools<br>particularly research and thought<br>leadership globally<br>through the principles that exist<br>through developing learning communities<br>such as this<br>and through promoting awareness of the<br>united nations sustainable development<br>goals<br>so that is the context and that's why<br>prime is<br>very excited to be able to host the<br>seminar series<br>and just to give you an overview because<br>this is<br>the first in the in our series<br>and we're going to kick off today with<br>uh<br>professor ang and he will talk to sdg<br>four and eight he is the professorial<br>chair for business in<br>asia and if you are interested in the<br>seminar series please take<br>the time now or at the end to sign up to<br>our mailing list so it's easier for us<br>to reach you when we circulate<br>information about these these seminars<br>oh sorry i didn't oh god nope<br>sorry i didn't mean to hit the link that<br>went awol<br>right so to kick this off sdg4<br>sdg8 and i hand over to<br>professor c f way thank you very much<br>i'm just trying to work out whether this<br>thing actually have batteries or not<br>all right so it works uh thanks<br>christian<br>for getting me involved um so i mean i<br>know<br>quite a lot of you in the room but also<br>you know as you know i<br>try not to be a bit too serious in all<br>my talks so if i make funny jokes that<br>you don't like<br>apologies for that but to start with<br>when i was approached<br>by christian the phone call comes and<br>you say okay<br>the chairs are doing the you know united<br>nations<br>sdg so are you going to do something<br>about it<br>i say well we are all here to make the<br>world a better place<br>right and so i went to the website<br>immediately and i say huh<br>it looks like i'm doing quite a few of<br>those out of the 17 and i can speak to<br>at least four and eight right and hence<br>my promise accidentally to christian and<br>all of a sudden i get the first lord<br>out of the blue but it's actually great<br>to be here to talk about um<br>a particular topic that i like which<br>transcends<br>a bit into the education into the<br>business sector which<br>uh i will tell a sort of a short story<br>about my<br>sort of engagement throughout for the<br>whole<br>not not just in terms of my time in<br>victoria but also<br>you know why actually we see some of the<br>things that i do<br>in that particular space as well so i've<br>titled the<br>building sustainable ecosystem through<br>the nexus of<br>quality education and decent work and<br>economic growth all right as you can see<br>here these are actually<br>two of the sdgs right sdg4<br>and sdg8 now before i go in and tell<br>us all about what i actually do um on a<br>daily basis as the chair business in<br>asia as well as the director of the<br>southeast asia cape right center of asia<br>plastic excellence<br>i thought i better defend myself for<br>being here christian<br>right by highlighting some of the areas<br>that i believe i think the box<br>when it comes to the things i do as a<br>chair and as well as a director of<br>asia pacific center around asia now um<br>so substantially<br>increase the number of youth and adults<br>who have relevant skills<br>including technical and vocational<br>skills for employment<br>decent jobs and entrepreneurship right<br>so that is<br>based on these headings in mind because<br>as i go through some of the things that<br>i do they will be there<br>now and of course you have global<br>citizenship and appreciation of<br>cultural diversity and of cultures<br>contribution to sustainable development<br>now third item under this heading with<br>quality education<br>is around substantially increased the<br>core supply of qualified teachers<br>including true international cooperation<br>for teacher training<br>in developing countries especially least<br>developed countries<br>in small island developing states<br>so those are the three items that i<br>think it fits the bill with<br>what i do as the chair in business in<br>asia now in terms of decent work and<br>economic growth right the two items that<br>i can single out is 8.2<br>achieve higher levels of economic<br>productivity through diversification<br>technological<br>upgrading and innovation including focus<br>including through a focus on high value<br>ad and labor intensive sectors<br>as well as encourage the formalization<br>and growth of<br>micro small and medium-sized<br>enterprises okay so when i actually go<br>through some of these<br>sustained breathing things it reminds me<br>of the some conversations that we have<br>about sustainability so<br>i remember last year for example in the<br>last two years when<br>uh the the southeast asia cape or is the<br>director of the southeast asia cape is<br>part of the working group<br>that try to craft business<br>sustainability in other words we try to<br>create<br>a kind of sustainable businesses in<br>other words to make sure that business<br>can sustain<br>it's almost like dealing with a pandemic<br>how to how do businesses survive right<br>it turns out that between the 10 of us<br>not not<br>just people from new zealand but also<br>people from southeast asia as well as<br>well as<br>a few others from other regions as well<br>we have actually a lot of risk<br>conceptualization what does the word<br>sustainability means<br>right for many people the sustainability<br>means that as long as you paint your<br>truck green<br>you look like you are sustainable right<br>and for others<br>it means different things right if you<br>talk about business sustainability then<br>it's a totally different kind of world<br>so how to make them<br>constantly being able to survive on the<br>regime<br>right whether it's survival or actually<br>growth it doesn't matter<br>now the same with education we talk<br>about not just one-off education like<br>individual course or program but also<br>you know in the university here for<br>example we talk about things like<br>you know life-long learning right and<br>all aspects of it so<br>we we put education as part of<br>everyone's<br>sort of life rather than to say that<br>they should only do it when they are<br>dealing with primary school secondary<br>school and then college and then after<br>that tertiary education you are done<br>right it's never done and bear in mind<br>that that is not just to<br>sustain the university finances right<br>it's not about selling them more<br>programs just we can run it through but<br>i think there's a lot of education<br>that needs to be required across a<br>person's lifetime<br>over there now um<br>the next five minutes i will talk about<br>a little bit of my background before i<br>jump into why we see what what what we<br>are doing<br>in the sea cape in particular right so<br>my background<br>goes like this accidentally i was in new<br>zealand<br>you know one of my first jobs after my<br>phd from national university of<br>singapore is to<br>send out 100 applications to find a job<br>but<br>you'll be surprised about 20 years ago<br>the national university of singapore is<br>not even accredited<br>right sounds amazing that 20 years ago<br>they were not accredited but they are<br>number one in<br>asia now so when i was searching for<br>jobs 100 applications no responses for a<br>while<br>and finally two institutions responded<br>one is uh<br>university of waikato welcome university<br>in hamilton that was the first time<br>i actually traveled down to new zealand<br>and then of course within a week i get<br>an offer from london to which then i<br>flew to london and decided to hang<br>around there<br>right instead the waikato folks some<br>folks are still around there not very<br>pleased<br>with the fact that they offered me<br>before i left<br>waikato but i didn't show up again so<br>subsequently when i left<br>london i searched for some jobs and<br>university of auckland show up so i<br>stayed there<br>at the university of auckland for 10<br>years right so and<br>you know you teach you do research but<br>in my last years<br>at the university of auckland i became<br>the associate dean right<br>of post grads and you know which covers<br>of course phd at the university of<br>auckland business school and was a<br>professor at that time as well<br>so so in my last days over there i did<br>create a lot of different programs<br>like you know the new top masters back<br>in 2012 the first of its kind<br>in new zealand restructure of the phd<br>program recreate of the business<br>uh sort of the the b com right bachelor<br>of commerce at that time<br>right uh first year studies business<br>10102 course that<br>puts the first year programs into<br>smaller classrooms<br>and then subsequently of course you know<br>move on right and i move on because<br>at victoria university they were<br>sounding me out for three years in a row<br>saying that i'm an asian expert right<br>but for those of those of you who have<br>been the academia for a long time<br>there's no such thing as an asia expert<br>because there's no such thing as a<br>discipline of asia<br>right so we don't call ourselves<br>discipline we talk we talk about<br>strategy we talk about international<br>business but we don't talk about asia<br>as an expert but nonetheless a lot of<br>the things that i do<br>in my past life around programs and<br>design does actually help what we do<br>uh in the second moving forward um and<br>you can see<br>as you can see from the first slide here<br>right these are actually just<br>business programs alone so we have um<br>sort of two areas of focus right<br>actually three areas of focus one is<br>around business engagement<br>is to engage with businesses of course<br>the other one is education engagement<br>right of course this language with<br>tertiary education for the most part<br>and the value chain that leads to the<br>business and of course the third part is<br>public engagement which is<br>almost sessions like this as well at the<br>same time about<br>trying to inform new zealanders or new<br>zealand organizations when it comes to<br>engagement with southeast asia that's my<br>remit<br>i see the seek i see the cakes right so<br>we have three capes<br>in the university system and there are<br>three so one north asia that is residing<br>in university of auckland<br>the second one latin america kept<br>residing here as well at victoria<br>university and the third one<br>southeast asia is the one that i run but<br>even though the seacape resides here but<br>is reporting to university of waikato<br>auckland university of auckland otago<br>and victoria victoria of course right so<br>the four universities<br>but given that i've been the chair for<br>the last seven years<br>and you know it's no surprises that you<br>know i'm i'm actually<br>sort of capable to deal with many bosses<br>right so i'm a man with many bosses<br>right throughout my time<br>that you run not just reporting to a lot<br>of advisory board for the chair but also<br>at the same time reporting to multiple<br>universities multiple stakeholders<br>in my role as the ck director<br>so in general the now what does the<br>cape does right in terms of the programs<br>that i fit into the system<br>is around the fact that one thing that<br>the cape has been asked to do is to try<br>to transfer knowledge<br>or sort of transit the type of knowledge<br>that we have in the university system to<br>try to help with the businesses out<br>there<br>right it was set up in that way if you<br>know if we have q a i'm happy to explain<br>a bit further<br>now the second thing is to try to make<br>sure that we actually produce<br>enough good students of the future so<br>that they can help to enable the<br>businesses out there<br>right and to that right i see a lot of<br>sustainability<br>of the businesses right there in that<br>program<br>now just very briefly right so some of<br>these things that we do including<br>workshops<br>for businesses for new zealand<br>businesses and we do that across<br>different regions we do about 20 to 25<br>of those<br>in a year we also run internships across<br>the nation<br>internships around programs that sort of<br>enable them to help<br>small medium enterprises right and and<br>that's why<br>one of the sustainability things that i<br>highlight is about micro small medium<br>enterprises and there's a catch there<br>that<br>yes these are the organizations that<br>doesn't have resources so we are trying<br>to<br>help them along in those dimensions now<br>we also develop<br>business projects and create resources<br>right so the title here is more like<br>resources to which<br>is a feeder right to um<br>sort of agencies or sort of a feeder to<br>agencies who actually help businesses or<br>actually direct feeder into businesses<br>about the knowledge in that region or<br>how new zealand can deal with that<br>region<br>as well now we are also part of a wider<br>network<br>around with the asean forum as well as<br>the new zealand asean business alliance<br>right this is to try to create a hub in<br>the southeast asia region to which<br>you know sea cape is part of the conduit<br>but also links<br>all the new zealand businesses into<br>southeast asia using our regional hubs<br>right we don't have to pay for it but at<br>the same time you know those are<br>actually kiwi presence<br>in those countries so we actually<br>managed to organize that<br>all the conduits together and then we<br>cut through the new zealand system which<br>has got<br>new zealand asean business council our<br>close partner<br>as well as southeast asia k plus of<br>course mfat and nzte<br>are also part of the regime as well<br>now in order to try to sort of be a bit<br>more productive right we also realized<br>that there's probably<br>a catch here to try to focus some of<br>these sort of<br>programs right some of these programs<br>into these industries<br>and we know tourism is you know fighting<br>very hard right to try to sustain<br>okay so we do still have some tourism<br>training programs but more<br>more likely it's not face to face<br>anymore people get tired about<br>that especially the tourism industry<br>christian will know that so<br>so it's more about resources creation<br>right to help people to push through and<br>to try to promote a lot more about the<br>new zealand right as a very good tourist<br>place and<br>and still keep people warm about coming<br>back at some point when the<br>borders are open but we also earned an<br>education is our business as usual to<br>which we are all doing it<br>but nonetheless we also look into future<br>industries such as those two that have<br>listed here<br>food and nutrition and this is one of<br>the industries that<br>a sort of a white sector right to which<br>new zealand has a lot of future inside<br>there right of course we are not talking<br>about<br>you know supply of raw materials or<br>supply of raw food or<br>or just fruits right we are talking<br>about the ability to create<br>say for example nutraceuticals and you<br>know further food processing and all<br>sorts of<br>health care related kind of food into<br>the regimes right in this case of course<br>my coverage is only southeast asia but<br>nonetheless<br>it's about trying to use that as a way<br>to try to sustain our own businesses<br>engagement there<br>as well as sort of in some ways also<br>teach others how to use<br>right some of this kind of technology<br>that we have in new zealand right and<br>sort of license<br>and and all sorts of training that new<br>zealand organizations can do<br>for southeast asia as well and to<br>actually sort of being able to<br>exchange a lot of things so so building<br>quite a lot of presence<br>in that space of trying to make sure<br>that<br>you know new zealand organizations in<br>that space and not just in that food and<br>nutrition space but also the digital and<br>creative export space<br>to which they can actually continue to<br>grow right the small medium enterprises<br>can<br>continue to grow with the help of some<br>of our sort of<br>resources that we build around uh these<br>things as well right<br>so these are quite industry specifics<br>but a lot of these<br>other than their individual programs we<br>do have all these other programs that<br>bolt onto it<br>and mip is one that you know it's called<br>market insights program is one that<br>links it to<br>uh interns right and therefore<br>i will come back to i will come to the<br>second sort of uh<br>remit about you know the kind of things<br>that i'm trying to weave together in the<br>ecosystem<br>right whereby you talk about you know<br>trying to feed<br>the the next generation in right not not<br>fit in terms of food but<br>feed them into the system to help the<br>businesses going along and train them<br>to how to try to help those businesses<br>when they engage<br>in those markets as well so the mip that<br>i've listed there which is the inter<br>local internship program is one of them<br>but crosslink we do have a lot of other<br>programs that is running true<br>right so we do have tertiary students<br>you know that move into three travel in<br>three<br>normally southeast asia major cities<br>over the period of three weeks to try to<br>interact with new zealand and local<br>representation both governments and both<br>businesses as well<br>of course as we know that you know the<br>sustainability of travel<br>means that we struggle in that sense but<br>don't worry we have responded<br>so in july this year we will have<br>another what 16 students from across the<br>country<br>probably up to 20 we can fund that<br>travels to nelson and christchurch to<br>visit some of these food and nutrition<br>and this focus is food and nutrition in<br>singapore in this particular trip so<br>so they'll be going around visiting some<br>of these companies like lincoln plant<br>and food<br>the pigs peanut butters lab and and so<br>on and so forth to<br>to actually do projects with them in<br>groups as well as then<br>of course hopefully right at some stage<br>they will create this<br>again resources for others to be able to<br>use and hopefully some of these two<br>students will also become interns as a<br>result in the coming summer as well for<br>these<br>folks as well right so as you can see<br>right if i were to talk about the team<br>students doing interns subsequently and<br>creating resource subsequently<br>i'm trying to build a journey right for<br>a lot of these students<br>to which that means they don't just<br>engage in one of activities that we<br>organize but multiple<br>and multiple activities that we organize<br>as well<br>now also we do have a maori focus in<br>southeast asia<br>right so we do quite a bit of work with<br>maori businesses but also we also do<br>quite a bit of<br>sort of maori specific trips right<br>meeting up with<br>not other indigenous business but<br>depending on the nature of the kind of<br>business that they interact with so a<br>lot of these things are actually done in<br>conjunction not just for student trips<br>so it's not a student tour so it's<br>basically business oriented<br>trips whereby they visit these companies<br>and so on and so forth<br>now so extend to the right hand side<br>here we do have a little bit of a work<br>that we do quite a lot with waikato<br>around<br>trying to make sure that there is enough<br>exposure in the secondary school<br>about you know the asia pacific region<br>right so southeast asia in my particular<br>case that i take care of<br>so we try to sort of put them into a<br>value chain right<br>in some ways getting good exposure for<br>them<br>and not just for them in this case<br>that's why we have a very special one<br>that talks about teachers as well right<br>so so talk about teachers as well so<br>as you know the system says that if we<br>expose enough to the teachers we have a<br>better chance of exposing<br>them to the secondary school students so<br>so we are doing a bit of that kind of<br>enabling process as well trying trying<br>to enable that capacity<br>so that they can help us to make sure<br>that the younger generations not all of<br>them<br>have to say yeah let's do asia or asia<br>pacific or whatever<br>right it means that we at least can get<br>enough exposure out there for those who<br>have that kind of mindset right to come<br>forward and start to engage<br>and get us to be able to track them down<br>so that we can actually move them along<br>uh into the regime as well right so for<br>that matter<br>so so we do that kind of um moving<br>backwards a bit to the value chain but<br>we don't do a lot but we do about a lot<br>of resources<br>resourcing and making sure that they are<br>linked to the tertiary because some of<br>them actually do<br>become tertiary students and and i've<br>seen i've<br>remember quite a few actually ends up in<br>victoria university as well and then of<br>course<br>linking education to the next expects<br>which is the business side of things as<br>well from where we sit<br>as part of our business engagement<br>now so for what for what i've actually<br>mentioned in the previous two slides<br>this is basically a nutshell right and<br>this is uh to be honest a bit<br>not fully updated because this picture<br>goes back a while ago but<br>some of these most of these programs<br>still exist right<br>i'm just trying to show you this<br>activity map sorry the fonts is a bit<br>too small so<br>but i'm just trying to show demonstrate<br>for example right just to give you an<br>example<br>right here say the internship program<br>okay so the internship program is<br>somehow linked<br>to the training right utilizing interns<br>and helping out with the cultural acumen<br>tourism training<br>right that we have a sort of a<br>partnership with otago university team<br>right around those training so it's<br>linked to internships as well<br>and this in turn some of them are<br>actually sharing knowledge<br>okay because they are also sort of in<br>some ways<br>part of the knowledge sharing regime to<br>which they are actually sort of<br>international savvy so they share with<br>other<br>secondary schools right about what kind<br>of knowledge that they have<br>and of course they also feed us into the<br>mrp so the<br>businesses who actually have interns are<br>also<br>showing up as part of our workshops and<br>being part of the workshops they are<br>also part of our business seminar series<br>guests sometimes and sometimes they do<br>show up in big events<br>by invitation because we so happen to<br>have some tickets around them<br>they are also part of part related to<br>our sort of business collaterals to we<br>create to fit into the<br>market readiness workshop to which we<br>train them right so so long story short<br>the ultimate aim of the whole thing and<br>this is not the complete picture that i<br>have now but<br>say for example the food and nutrition<br>sector<br>and the sort of the digital export<br>sector is on the<br>side here so i'm weaving all these<br>programs into<br>different sectors right to which then we<br>can create<br>almost a system of complexity of<br>multiple<br>engagement with individual businesses<br>multiple engagement with students<br>and then basically having them go<br>through a journey<br>right in our interweave way and because<br>of who we are right it's interesting um<br>that the capes does have a remit that<br>says that we are<br>we cannot allow students to take on<br>our activity for credit so in other<br>words you know we cannot<br>recap sort of like substitute what the<br>university is doing on on course credit<br>so<br>so in some ways you know we our programs<br>also need that flexibility to make sure<br>that the students can<br>almost hop in and hop out<br>right so our programs are sort of spread<br>across the year without say<br>a trimester decision like we do t1 or we<br>do t3 or that kind of thing so<br>so we do have to structure them around<br>the students period when they are<br>actually free right which puts us into a<br>lot of<br>sort of ability to scale up it's very<br>hard to scale up when you crash with<br>courses<br>i mean the last thing we want is to<br>steal all the students to leave the<br>classroom and<br>join us on a trip right but of course<br>this is they are not showing up either<br>so<br>that's a different matter right so so<br>basically this is the<br>the masterpiece of trying to to make<br>them the ecosystem and i must say that<br>the ecosystem is still evolving so i<br>can't say that we are celebrating yet<br>it will take a while for us to actually<br>sort of create something that is massive<br>enough that they keep coming back for<br>for things in and and the ones who will<br>fit into the system like m-fat or<br>anxiety<br>sooner or later will stand up right in<br>some of the kind of things that we work<br>with them on as well<br>so um i think this is the last slide as<br>well if you are just bear with me on<br>this one so<br>basically this is the the cape metrics<br>that i have for<br>until 2019 right so 2017-19 these are<br>the kind of metrics that we get measured<br>against roughly right at least for the<br>southeast asia kit<br>now you must be say that in this<br>particular<br>in this particular cape that i run<br>because um<br>in order to engage with southeast asia<br>this english is the business language so<br>i don't have to train them<br>uh in terms of the language because<br>there are just too many of them anyway<br>right so bahasa mandarin and this and<br>that so<br>so we don't have a lot of language<br>training but this is what happens that<br>we have clocked in 2017 to 19<br>and these are the statistics that we<br>have actually measured in 2020<br>and just to alert you to the kind of<br>things that we do for example<br>you know so for example by about 2090 we<br>would have about 451 ck followers on<br>linkedin<br>uh the last time i checked uh we do have<br>about 895<br>by yesterday right so in this one year<br>we have actually grown twice<br>on linkedin you know followers now it's<br>the same for twitter right we have<br>actually grown as well from 599 to about<br>800<br>something right smaller growth but<br>nonetheless there<br>in terms of our newsletter subscribers<br>from one seven one seven to one zero<br>nine one as well<br>right so in terms of the businesses and<br>the participants we are also growing<br>right from 476 right<br>all the way to about 420 and so on and<br>so forth<br>right so this is a system that i'm<br>trying to create so that there are more<br>and more<br>people coming through but i'm also<br>trying to make sure that the businesses<br>and the individuals who are already in<br>the system can find different things to<br>do<br>so they are they are journey fights<br>right maybe there's no such word but i'd<br>like to use this word right<br>they are justified through some training<br>so that they actually the two systems of<br>education and businesses becomes closely<br>needed<br>so then we can create a proper ecosystem<br>to which<br>well by the way the word says it's more<br>sustainable<br>with that i say thank you<br>thank you very much yeah so there is a<br>very<br>very busy person as we learned from that<br>overview<br>and we um i also see that the capes are<br>more and more<br>crazy about metrics so it was<br>interesting to see those<br>impressive metrics and now you have<br>another metric to add<br>like well of course 17 of them right<br>that's right<br>and an audience so i would just<br>like to try and for the zoom<br>participants i'll try and change the<br>camera setting um so that they can get<br>the<br>whole room and i would now like to to<br>open this up for the discussion so the<br>the format is designed to be<br>informative to really get some<br>interesting information out there<br>from the funded chairs so that they have<br>the opportunity to talk about their work<br>and then to engage in in discussion<br>dialogue<br>and i would like to invite<br>the audience in the room to start and<br>i'll check on<br>zoom whether there are questions from<br>there<br>would anyone like to yes alan<br>thank you so much i should declare<br>eventually<br>cheers<br>wasn't that unclear what sustainable<br>goals<br>actually are in terms of whether they're<br>things that one would hope would apply<br>to individuals<br>or to countries and in fact from my time<br>and<br>i did try and map sustainable<br>development goals off their programs and<br>gave up<br>in the sphere because they easily met<br>that would say how much<br>we doing ck work<br>for the benefit but basically there's a<br>private level<br>and if it's the social benefit we're<br>after<br>are we focused on how it's propagated<br>how it leads to broader social benefits<br>and how it avoids the new zealand<br>leakage problem<br>new zealand is getting introduced to<br>southeast asia and going off to<br>work okay thanks ellen i'm trying to<br>digest your long question but uh<br>sorry for the benefit of the zoom<br>attendees could we<br>give me the question yes<br>now i will interpret the question like<br>okay there is<br>is that you you know is the un sdgs<br>you know sort of supposed to see the<br>impact<br>at the national level or at the<br>individual level or the business level<br>that would be a quick first question and<br>the second question is about whether<br>you know if the businesses are actually<br>the ones that are sort of<br>making sort of good things out of the<br>whole regime right<br>now what does it say about whether you<br>know the sea cape or<br>the activities that we are trying to do<br>necessary can be<br>mapped onto social goals is that fair<br>ellen<br>right so sort of the first question<br>right i think<br>it relates my view right i mean my view<br>could be wrong but my view is that<br>basically if you just look at those<br>items at least under 17<br>and and those sub headings there it<br>looks like they have convoluted<br>everything<br>right so so some of the items they would<br>have talked about<br>nations some of the items they would<br>talk about the individuals upscaling<br>some of the items they will be talking<br>about the engagement level so so i<br>interpret it as<br>it can be sort of done at different<br>levels activities wise but<br>when they sum up together right<br>technically the world is a better place<br>right or at least new zealand is a<br>better place right as a result of that<br>so so that would be my take on it and<br>and relating to the respond to the<br>second question then yes there's a<br>danger that when we do these things we<br>do it you know just to help one or two<br>individual business becoming bigger and<br>more profiteering<br>that doesn't really come back to us<br>right so so that's why for<br>for that matter we don't normally sort<br>of provide each business too many<br>activities we normally give them two or<br>three help<br>different types of health but at the<br>same time<br>you know because somehow you know we are<br>linked to mfat<br>and anxiety as well we do pass it on to<br>others to actually use them<br>right but i push them in terms of the<br>businesses wise i push them to use the<br>students<br>right and that's one thing that you know<br>i would say take a little bit<br>a box about you know making sure that<br>the businesses are actually<br>moving on and dragging the next<br>generation along and i see that as one<br>of the first<br>social sort of aspects of it that can<br>happen<br>and of course there's a risk that we<br>will lose some personnel in the process<br>as well but um you know i haven't got<br>got around to how to keep their profits<br>in the country though<br>thank you i probably should have tried<br>to summarize that question apologies<br>but it was also quite a substantial one<br>you did very well sia<br>thank you are there any other questions<br>from the<br>i'm really interested in the whole work<br>obviously<br>and i am just wondering in terms<br>of what involvement with businesses with<br>the internships<br>how much evaluation do you do of<br>whether the businesses are providing<br>decent food<br>may i just summarize that for the zoom<br>attendees again so the question is<br>do in terms of the internships um to<br>what extent there is some<br>level of oversight understanding whether<br>decent work takes place<br>yeah for any internships we do have<br>certain projects that sticks to it so in<br>other words there is a remit around<br>certain projects in other words it can<br>be just photocopying<br>you know well they make they may have to<br>make some cover copying in the meantime<br>or some coffee but for them for the bulk<br>of it<br>we will stick on we have a supervisor<br>that sticks on to the student<br>that make sure and then of course the<br>first negotiation process<br>is normally between the directors or<br>senior level at the<br>capes to be able to negotiate with the<br>company as to what projects we are<br>talking about<br>right before they actually go into an<br>internship and we expect an output<br>rather than just internship for the sake<br>of internship<br>right so there's no chance that the<br>internship that we will do<br>is something there's a chance the<br>student just get a very<br>very weak experience rather than a very<br>substantial one<br>around any feasibility study or market<br>assessment study of<br>opportunities in southeast asia and we<br>partner this with<br>a lot of different agencies that have<br>connectivity with<br>businesses who are interested in<br>southeast asia or who are already there<br>trying to do more and understanding<br>as i said to alan as well we don't<br>normally do it many times for one single<br>business<br>because otherwise it becomes almost like<br>a cheap consulting<br>right as well as probably we also don't<br>do anything for consulting companies<br>because then we'll be doing free<br>consulting for consulting companies<br>which is bad<br>we're better off doing this for the<br>business school right that's right<br>i hope that addressed a bit of your<br>as well um you know i think i think in<br>that<br>in in those in in that way right we can<br>only access them<br>in terms of whether they have interest<br>in those markets<br>right rather than whether they are<br>aligning with the 17 of them<br>but i presume that they are probably<br>going after<br>growth right which of course will be<br>extremely useful<br>and if we are trying to protect some of<br>these small medium enterprises<br>or micro enterprises it makes sense to<br>help them along on those things as to<br>whether they comply with some of these<br>or not<br>we don't normally go too much in detail<br>as long as they<br>make sure that decent work is done right<br>using the student and<br>decent outputs actually happens<br>but i think it's a very valuable<br>question to ask in uh<br>in this climate where attitudes are<br>changing<br>um yes just behind it<br>very good question like everybody else<br>we we provide some reporting ours isn't<br>quite as fancy as<br>cs so we we<br>write a report every two years and it's<br>called a<br>sharing information on progress report<br>so i do this for the whole<br>business school and we write a report<br>where we document against the six<br>principles of prime<br>that we have made progress that we're<br>not standing still<br>we're moving with the times and we are<br>in a cycle of continuous improvement<br>where we<br>we look assess and we try to improve for<br>the subsequent years<br>and those six principles are<br>quite structured they're about values<br>they're about<br>research then about they're about<br>teaching and learning how we<br>how we cultivate those those values but<br>increasingly the focus has come on to<br>how do these 17 sdgs feature and how do<br>we address them<br>so this is what our last report did<br>quite explicitly and our next report<br>which is due in august<br>will take this further and hopefully we<br>will have<br>achieved some progress so our sharing<br>progress report highlights some<br>improvement but it's<br>it's a very important question and it's<br>we we take it seriously and prime<br>will de-list members who don't report<br>and that's i think something that's very<br>important to give it that<br>sense that this is an important movement<br>going towards<br>2030. i'm happy to share my template<br>with you<br>it helps two three five i have no idea<br>how my team worked out these numbers but<br>it works very impressive yes hi i'm<br>barbara allen from the school of<br>government<br>um just wondering where your students<br>are coming from are you looking for them<br>are they coming to you or you connect<br>with particular courses<br>and i say that because school of<br>government might not be your obvious<br>yeah yeah yeah they could they could be<br>targets right because it's you see the<br>the kind of regimes that i normally set<br>up right because i emphasize two things<br>right<br>one is you know understanding the new<br>zealand's perspective<br>right both government and and the<br>business end of things of course<br>but i'm also very keen to make sure that<br>we know the perspective of what asean<br>wants from us<br>right whether they are governments or<br>businesses as well and i think<br>you know talking about supply and demand<br>sometimes you don't even know who is the<br>supplier who is the demand<br>right and so so i think most of our<br>activities we go<br>social media so so we always call for<br>interest<br>in our activities it's very i don't<br>think i've come across<br>any instances where i have to keep<br>shoulder tapping people like hey come<br>drag somebody across them turn key or<br>whatever<br>right or from the lt2 just to<br>participate for example the teammate<br>process that i mentioned<br>nelson and christchurch in july we<br>haven't called for it but i think it<br>should be out in about two weeks<br>nationwide and we normally promote it<br>across the eight universities<br>right so as long as the eight<br>universities marketing incomes doesn't<br>malfunction<br>right they should be able to spread the<br>love around right<br>so i mean in victoria we do spread<br>around as well through our own comps<br>but we can always make sure that you<br>know if you you know if you say that the<br>school government needs to be<br>on the sort of the list of people to to<br>email just let me know<br>there's no problem at all i'm sure it<br>cross lag because we work quite closely<br>with nfed and anzac tea as well and<br>a lot of other agencies because somehow<br>or rather it's not just new zealand out<br>there i mean the government runs<br>blood businesses right or the government<br>runs around the businesses or run down<br>the businesses right so they<br>necessarily own a lot of businesses or<br>have so much to say<br>in the business environment out there<br>which is slightly different from<br>from how we operate here but you know<br>feel free and our activities we<br>encourage<br>spread across the country though so so<br>as much as i<br>love all the victoria university<br>students i can only give them the<br>appropriate proportion right so that we<br>are nationwide as well for that matter<br>can i still jump back to ellen's<br>question because i'm still lingering<br>about that you have asked me many times<br>that<br>same question so obviously i haven't<br>provided any answers like that is<br>substantial enough but<br>but i must say that you know i see us<br>interacting and training with businesses<br>but<br>but actually in the grand scheme of<br>things we are actually not<br>the direct customer facing people right<br>so<br>so when i say we are not the direct<br>customer facing people we are<br>say for example the businesses right so<br>so we are training them but we are<br>training them so that<br>you know anzac tea can take over at some<br>stage to help them along<br>pushing a bit further into those markets<br>now we are also training them because<br>say for example our partnership<br>uh you know between anxiety because<br>anxiety can only help so many<br>uh enterprises so so the rest they just<br>you know don't know what to do<br>so they will pass it on to say for<br>example the asean new zealand business<br>council<br>and asean new zealand business council<br>doesn't really earn money so they really<br>only do membership<br>and they don't train businesses properly<br>right so they will pass it back to us<br>and we will train for all the two<br>institutions and secti<br>as well as asean new zealand business<br>council before they actually go to the<br>next step so so we are part of that<br>larger<br>ecosystem as well without being sort of<br>like<br>like first and equal in the customer<br>facing side for<br>businesses but we are definitely the<br>number one facing one among the<br>ecosystem we are the number one facing<br>one for the students because we are part<br>of the university system<br>so thank you for<br>addressing that yes arthur yeah that's<br>it thanks very much<br>as well um when you're thinking about<br>the economic growth angle here is the g8<br>are you thinking about that<br>southeast asia what are you thinking<br>about from<br>um the perspective of the southeast<br>asian<br>countries uh and what's what's going to<br>be useful for them<br>in terms of the hard drive and<br>presumably<br>well i might be in the wrong job if i<br>actually do the second second one<br>because the first because the remit of<br>the sea cave is actually to look after<br>new zealanders<br>only right so new zealanders and new<br>zealand organizations only so<br>when i talk about economic growth right<br>it necessarily goes down two steps right<br>presumably at some stage when exports<br>work or you know when we have actually<br>more<br>of the kind of productivity as a result<br>of that connectivity<br>right it should come in the form of<br>economic growth for the country<br>productivity or export wise and but then<br>if you go<br>down one step then we actually have to<br>enable businesses<br>who can actually provide that sort of<br>like the next<br>layer of firms right so we are not just<br>of course not<br>losing out individual firms but you know<br>we are not just going to just rely on<br>food like fonterra or zespri we are just<br>going to think about digital<br>which we are very strong in that space<br>we are just going to think about<br>nutraceuticals or or healthcare think<br>healthcare stuff<br>to which we can actually grow the<br>economy right as well as well<br>you grow these firms but you also grow<br>the economy as a result of growing these<br>firms because they also have to hire<br>people<br>and some of these people are actually<br>our students and so on and so forth so<br>part of my<br>sort of training process also try to<br>make sure that we match up students with<br>the<br>uh you know sort of the jobs as well<br>right so so interestingly i don't<br>i think some of the schools own the mit<br>not the manuka institute of technology<br>but the master of international trade<br>right so<br>so one of my previous summer scholar<br>right works with me and<br>nfed project on on summer scholarship<br>right<br>which we do it almost every year and<br>subsequently she get hired into the<br>sort of the apec team as well and fed as<br>well so this kind of<br>sort of setup is actually quite nice and<br>in one of the cases one of our undergrad<br>students actually get a job in<br>wellington chamber of commerce<br>because they are actually close<br>collaborators to us and you know they<br>want to<br>be part of the process of the kind of<br>students that engage with<br>us deeply and to go through interview<br>will i see some benefits from what<br>you're doing<br>they will benefit from what new zealand<br>can offer<br>when it comes to the ability around our<br>creative industries<br>or our sort of high value at<br>nutraceuticals products or health care<br>systems<br>and the ability say for example to you<br>know to have high quality<br>uh process in terms of producing food<br>and all sorts of things as well because<br>there's not a<br>you know arable land is limited so they<br>need a lot of technologies<br>uh when it comes to all those process as<br>well so so that's where they<br>gain right and their gains is actually<br>our gain as well right as a result of<br>you know training them<br>in in some ways right so for example i<br>know that new zealand is working with<br>singapore very closely with uh with the<br>agency called a star<br>which is the national sort of science<br>you know<br>sort of arena to which they house all<br>the scientific innovation<br>i thought you would know that one thank<br>you very much i think this is a perfect<br>point to draw the seminar to a class<br>so thank you very much see ya thank you<br>very much to the<br>audience in the room thank you very much<br>to everybody on<br>zoom and just before you leave us i<br>would like to show our<br>schedule again so if you would like to<br>ask alan questions<br>that will be in two weeks time if you<br>would like to<br>ask other questions that will be in<br>about three months<br>time so get your questions ready and uh<br>please<br>join us for this um seminar series this<br>is the link again<br>how you sign up and then i would ask you<br>to<br>thank sia and also his team who have<br>been supporting and getting this set up</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
