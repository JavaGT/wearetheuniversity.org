He was Clinical Leader of Orthopaedic Surgery between 2009 and 2019.<br><br><br>He is head of the section of Orthopaedic Surgery and a founding member of the Centre for Musculo-skeletal outcomes research (CMOR). His research interests include the long-term results of hip replacement and the provision of elective orthopaedic surgery including the use of scoring tools and equity of access across New Zealand.<br><br><br>Much of his research comes from a large service improvement programme for orthopaedics in Dunedin that he led. This included enhanced recovery after joint replacement surgery and a physiotherapy–led clinic designed to improve non-operative management of patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis. He is currently collaborating on research aimed at improving patients’ fitness for surgery.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated

to professor at the<br>university of otago is not<br>easily achieved and david has gone<br>through quite a rigorous process<br>to demonstrate that he has achieved<br>sustained<br>outstanding leadership and sustained<br>outstanding competence<br>in research teaching and service<br>this involves seeking feedback from<br>external referees<br>across the world and while in a moment<br>professor subramanian<br>is going to give a biography and summary<br>of david's achievements<br>i thought i'd like to share with you<br>some of the comments we've received<br>that highlight david's skills and<br>abilities<br>so as well as being an orthopedic<br>surgeon<br>david has demonstrated remarkable depth<br>and breadth in his research<br>his referees comment on his most<br>distinctive achievement as being the<br>translational nature of his health<br>service research<br>his research looking at prioritization<br>tools<br>alternative methods to manage patient<br>demand and<br>implementing structural change have had<br>significant impacts<br>nationally in the teaching sphere<br>david has been a leader in terms of<br>driving education change<br>and curriculum review he's demonstrated<br>dedication to the education of both<br>undergraduates and postgraduates as well<br>as his supervision for many years of the<br>fellowship program<br>and throughout that he has demonstrated<br>a distinctive brand of leadership<br>his colleagues talk about david leading<br>from the front<br>he nurtures his team members to get the<br>best out of them<br>but is not shy to take on all aspects of<br>a project<br>when that's what's required and if<br>that's not<br>enough as well as all this david's also<br>an accomplished athlete<br>and

robin<br>subramaniam the dean of the otago<br>medical school<br>it gives me distinct honor to introduce<br>david today<br>for his ipl david has an illustrious<br>medical career he graduated<br>from his undergraduate studies at<br>cambridge<br>finished his medical studies at oxford<br>and completed his fellowship of the<br>college of surgeons as well as royal<br>australasian college of<br>surgeons david's<br>law of affair with new zealand started<br>at palmerston<br>north hospital where he did as a senior<br>house officer in 1988<br>and then he came to dunedin<br>in 1991 and did the orthopedic registrar<br>eventually david became a orthopedic<br>consultant<br>in 2001 at the dunedin hospital<br>so he has served in that capacity over<br>the last<br>two decades of those two decades<br>for 10 years he served as the<br>clinical leader of orthopedic services<br>at the canadian hospital and a<br>remarkable<br>career<br>for the university he was appointed as a<br>senior lecturer in 2001<br>and an associate professor in 2011<br>and this year as a professorial<br>appointment and i want to talk about his<br>research impact as well as<br>its interest it<br>spans two areas hip<br>and knee joint replacement and<br>arthroplasty<br>as well as the health services research<br>implementation and improvement<br>because of this interest david<br>became one of the founding members of<br>the<br>center for musculoskeletal outcome<br>research<br>at the dunedin school of medicine of<br>in 2012 to 2014<br>david did a pivotal study funded by the<br>ministry of health at the time<br>to close to a million dollar looking at<br>the<br>productivity of the elective services<br>and workforce as you can see<br>this passion is about improving<br>the orthopedic services in dunedin<br>as well as in new zealand<br>with this illustrious carrier david is<br>pursuing an<br>md at university of otago<br>and his title of his talk is increasing<br>demand for<br>hip and knee replacement<br>can we stem the time this talk will<br>articulate the reasons for increasing<br>demand<br>the strategies to address this<br>demand as well as the patient outcomes<br>with that introduction i congratulate<br>david on this inaugural professorial<br>relationship and invite him to deliver<br>well thank you acting vice chancellor<br>and dean for those kind<br>didn't sound much like me it's an honour<br>to be here in front of<br>family colleagues i think a few patients<br>and friends academic orthopedic surgeons<br>are an endangered species in fact i<br>think some people think they're a<br>mythical species<br>and never for a moment that i thought<br>when i first arrived in dunedin that i'd<br>become only the fourth<br>professor of orthopedic surgery in<br>dunedin after alan aldrid<br>keith jeffrey and jean-claude who's with<br>us<br>tonight<br>let me see so i'm going to make some<br>disclosures slightly tongue-in-cheek i'm<br>first and foremost a surgeon<br>i'm really an accidental academic i<br>never intended to be one<br>and it just kind of happened these are<br>my personal views they're based on my md<br>thesis and published research<br>they may not be those of sdhb sorry<br>janine<br>and i also funding for the opp<br>was provided by the ministry of health<br>which was the big project that ruthen<br>alluded to so i come from bedford<br>which is about 50 miles north of london<br>it's that little red dot<br>cambridge is just to the side and<br>it's rather flat boring countryside with<br>brussels sprout fields and on the edge<br>of the fins<br>it's quite multicultural with a large<br>west indian population a lot of italians<br>that came to work in the brickworks<br>poles and large indian population as<br>well<br>it was an awful long way to the sea in<br>the mountains so<br>that's probably one reason why i ended<br>up a long way away from it so i went to<br>bedford modern school which<br>was a direct grant school i passed the<br>11 plus<br>my father taught their um chemistry it's<br>quite an<br>academic school probably closest to<br>otago boys<br>um and it was probably inevitable that<br>i'd end up in medicine<br>and i'm fourth generation my<br>great-grandfather was a medical<br>missionary in china my grandfather<br>also a gold medalist at the london<br>hospital was a missionary<br>in nigeria and my mother and uncle were<br>both<br>doctors we were rugby rugby in qriket<br>school and my career was<br>not illustrious i played two games for<br>the under-12s at cricket<br>um i was in rugby i was saw myself as<br>barry john<br>but i was too slow um too small<br>too weak and totally untalented<br>which was similar to my music career<br>where i played the cello and i played<br>for a couple of years in the second<br>orchestra but i wasn't really very good<br>i did manage to get into the school's b<br>bridge<br>team and we somehow managed to win the<br>county championship which was a bit of a<br>fluke<br>i really just wanted to be a climber but<br>that was difficult in bedford<br>um so i played a lot of water polo and<br>uh with a certain amount of success our<br>school were national champions<br>and um we were nice up in the national<br>club championship<br>and i played a little bit of national<br>league water polo when they were short<br>so at our school basically if you were<br>smart the expectation was that you tried<br>for oxbridge<br>um and so i was successful<br>in being accepted to queen's college<br>cambridge which was founded in 1448<br>this is the old the old court<br>and the president's lodge newton's<br>mathematical bridge which was designed<br>to be<br>put together without any nails and<br>just based on physics principles when<br>they took it apart to renovate it they<br>didn't manage to put it back together<br>again<br>and there are actually a number of bolts<br>and i guess osh would probably<br>expect that these days so my brother<br>followed me up there he had one of the<br>great rooms in old court whereas i was<br>in<br>friars up around here i continued<br>playing water polo and<br>captained the university in my final<br>year and got three half blues<br>whilst playing and had quite a lot of<br>fun along the way<br>great thing about cambridge was you<br>could sink into mediocrity having been<br>expected to do very well at school<br>and you could walk to the uh past the<br>cavendish labs where rutherford got his<br>nobel prize<br>uh and things like that and so it's a<br>very um inspirational environment to be<br>in<br>and a lot of my friends and colleagues<br>have gone on to great things<br>i didn't want to go to london so i went<br>to oxford for my clinical years<br>and this is woolston college which was a<br>graduate college the john radcliffe<br>hospital had just opened<br>and that was where we were doing most of<br>our clinical work<br>and i continued playing water polo and<br>got another three half blues for oxford<br>jim mann who you may recognize i don't<br>know if he's actually here<br>today um was actually my clinical<br>advisor at oxford<br>um and uh i didn't have an awful lot to<br>do with him<br>um but he did advise me<br>to get do a good medical job a medical<br>house job<br>um and recommended i go to hereford uh<br>where a friend of his was working<br>um which was pivotal for me because i<br>have started to make the links that<br>ended up getting me to new zealand<br>and also some of my climbing links my<br>first job was in surgery and stoke on<br>trent in the potteries<br>um i didn't manage to get a university<br>house job<br>um obviously didn't talk to the right<br>people um<br>so this was the sort of day where we did<br>one in three with cross cover on call<br>24 hour cover and your overtime was paid<br>but we had a good time it was like being<br>a student but getting paid and only<br>nights off he tended to go to the pub<br>and have a few beers<br>i remember taking some x-rays along or<br>not perhaps x-rays but<br>going to the jolly potters which sat<br>behind the heart between the hartsville<br>orthopaedic hospital and the other<br>hospital<br>to find my registrar to tell him that i<br>thought a patient might have dislocated<br>and this was me in my surgical job greg<br>falk was an australian registrar<br>who i worked with and helped me a lot<br>and we co-wrote my first paper as a<br>first year house surgeon<br>i decided to go to palmerston north uh<br>for a house job<br>for emergency department rather than go<br>to birmingham or somewhere boring<br>um and that proved quite important<br>because i met this young lady who'd<br>just started doing anaesthetics at that<br>stage<br>and who became my wife fuller and i<br>spent six months there<br>working in a time when there were five<br>shows running the whole of the emergency<br>department<br>which is a little bit different from<br>these days<br>and we had a lot of fun and uh became<br>much more confident at managing<br>uh things um compared with everything<br>having to go through your boss<br>i was only there for six months um i<br>went back to cambridge to demonstrate<br>anatomy<br>and so harold sorry harold ellis former<br>professor at the westminster<br>had just retired and he was the clinical<br>anatomist in the united<br>department he died recently at 95 and i<br>think<br>was a founding member of the nhs reading<br>his obituary<br>and he was a passionate anatomist he<br>wrote the book clinical anatomy and he<br>just made it all make sense<br>so basically he and a lot of hard work<br>got me through my part one exams which i<br>took and then did a trauma job for a<br>year<br>in cambridge at aden brooks and went on<br>to do urology and general surgery<br>in leicester before taking my part two<br>i took a little bit of a gap because my<br>friends from hereford were going on the<br>first british<br>expedition to try and climb chamlang<br>which is the 7 300 meter peak in nepal<br>and so i went to the professor and said<br>um what do you think about me going to<br>go on a<br>climbing trip and he said don't say why<br>not<br>um so i took six months off and i didn't<br>summit but i did climb a couple of six<br>thousand<br>meter trekking peaks on that trip about<br>uh two months later when i got back i<br>was successful in passing my part two<br>exam examine general<br>surgery in general at the college and<br>this is<br>taken in front of sir john hunter's<br>statue at the college of surgeons in the<br>uk<br>it wasn't going to be particularly easy<br>to get a registrar job in orthopedics<br>which is what i wanted to do<br>and so i wrote around the world<br>and um discovered that<br>they were getting a bit short in dunedin<br>and keith jeffrey rang up and offered me<br>a job<br>as a junior registrar<br>ola's residency was expiring and so we<br>needed to come back so we thought it was<br>good timing<br>so i arrived in dunedin keith was<br>professor<br>jean-claude dice was the senior lecturer<br>john matheson was really important<br>because he was on the education<br>committee and i had to convince him i<br>was worth getting on the training<br>program<br>which took three years and um michael<br>chin was my<br>co-registrar and taught me most of what<br>i know and still does<br>um and andrew swan bruce mcmillan<br>and bruce hodgson and john dunbar were<br>the other consultants in the department<br>at the time<br>and nice to see you here tonight andrew<br>um<br>jim clayton was another pivotal figure<br>for us because<br>um while he was trying to get her<br>registration and<br>he was one the medical council and he<br>managed to get her specialist<br>qualification<br>sorted so a few hurdles along the way<br>but after three years<br>i started training and allah was able to<br>start as a consultant<br>so i was lagging about five years behind<br>her<br>we loved otago we basically i fell in<br>love with it pretty much on our first<br>weekend away when we went up to central<br>um and so most of our weekends were<br>spent<br>climbing trekking and tramping<br>and eventually after a couple of<br>attempts i managed to summit iraqi mount<br>cook<br>after a 47-hour epic cut to hut<br>including vivienne<br>on the top of the linda shelf so<br>almost as slow as mark ingles attempt i<br>think but um<br>unfortunately we had no downsides<br>um a year later i made the front page of<br>the odt for the first time for the wrong<br>reasons when my climbing partner was<br>avalanched off the<br>ramp coming down from aspiring<br>fortunately surviving<br>and we were very fortunate in the days<br>before plrb's of uh<br>managing to get rescued that night and<br>around about the same time<br>we discovered uh that hawaiia is our<br>special place and border section<br>and have basically used that as our<br>escape for the last<br>so i got onto the orthopedic training<br>program and<br>um john matheson said to me now the hard<br>work starts<br>and i thought i thought i had been<br>working quite hard but<br>um he was right um<br>i hated my year in auckland i think it<br>was very valuable i worked over 70 hours<br>a week excluding call<br>robbie was born was was one julia was<br>born when we were in christchurch<br>and basically we were in the tunnel of<br>work<br>family and exams i wrote a seminal paper<br>on foot rock vaccine injuries<br>which has been cited 25 times published<br>in new zealand medical<br>journal and<br>i did some slightly better papers with<br>sue stott from starship on mrsa<br>in pediatrics and i<br>actually what's become a classic paper<br>on radiation use and spine surgery with<br>peter robertson<br>and i've learned i think the advantage<br>of collaborating with senior authors who<br>can turn your work into something much<br>better<br>and richard nicol gary hooper and paul<br>armor were very influential<br>teachers in my orthopedic training<br>so i finished and qualified passed my<br>exam<br>and went to edinburgh following the<br>footsteps of quite a few people<br>including michael chin<br>and worked for the godfather of scottish<br>orthopedics colin howie<br>who's become a good friend and has<br>visited us a few times<br>he advises the scottish government on<br>everything he's a<br>incredibly high volume surgeon<br>semi-retired now<br>and it was a great experience working at<br>the princess margaret rose orthopedic<br>hospital<br>which was an old tb hospital that was so<br>condemned that the roof actually fell<br>down on the way into the waiting bay<br>during the time that i was<br>there and we had to take the patients in<br>and out through the recovery area<br>um that the new royal was being built at<br>the time i<br>think i did over 250 joint replacements<br>that year<br>both as primary operator and assistant<br>and that<br>was a fantastic experience<br>so i'd expressed an interest in<br>returning to dunedin at that stage<br>i had a chat with jean-claude on the<br>sidelines of the soccer game at prospect<br>park<br>and followed it up with an email and<br>that turned out to be my job interview<br>because i got an email some way through<br>the course of the year saying ps<br>i can confirm your appointment as a<br>senior lecturer an orthopedic surgeon<br>we want you back for the start of the<br>academic year so i cut my fellowship<br>plans a little bit short and found<br>myself<br>as a academic orthopedic surgeon on the<br>basis of<br>seven papers done mainly without<br>statistics<br>funding and wherever possible no ethics<br>committee<br>because they were case series or<br>something like that anyway<br>i had no postgraduate degree and<br>i came back mainly to do hip and knee<br>replacements and richard whitney who's<br>here tonight was my cpg manager at the<br>time<br>and i was very helpful and continued to<br>have a strong relationship through mercy<br>hospital<br>so this is the bulk of my work this was<br>a patient who also ended up on the front<br>page of the paper<br>because he was declined surgery he had<br>varus knees that you could drive a pig<br>through<br>and 20 degree flexion deformity on each<br>side<br>and we were able to actually replace<br>both his knees and get him back<br>working and walking as a forklift truck<br>driver and this is a typical<br>collapsed horrible hip which we can<br>convert into<br>a hip replacement and give somebody a<br>near normal quality of life<br>so it was a busy period two kids just<br>starting school we bought a big old<br>place that had needed an awful lot of<br>work<br>and we thoroughly embraced the south<br>island and the otago lifestyle<br>started fishing and golf got my handicap<br>down to about<br>20 mainly cheating not counting<br>the odd mulligans and that sort of type<br>thing and i did manage to achieve my<br>confirmation pathway within four years<br>and we had a fantastic time uh escaping<br>up to<br>hawaii in 2007 i had my first mid-life<br>crisis<br>and i retired from fishing and golf and<br>decided to take up multi-sport<br>and so started off doing the gold rush<br>with my colleagues<br>mike chin and john dunbar as you can see<br>the kids were quite small at that stage<br>and we we did the gold rush about nine<br>times slowly my<br>partners broke down and stopped<br>competing<br>um and in the end i had to do it on my<br>own and i moved on to the coast to coast<br>um and i've completed eight of those as<br>now<br>last year i was roundly beaten by my<br>daughter<br>and i can't possibly compete with my son<br>on the river<br>he beat me by a long way when he and his<br>another really important thing<br>opportunity arose in 2009 when a chance<br>conversation with robin walker and then<br>john hayden<br>led to the chance to be able to go to<br>kundy hospital<br>to the ed hillary hospital and do some<br>teaching so this is<br>me and dr kami timber having a<br>discussion about how to immobilize<br>cervical spine injuries over a cup of<br>tea<br>and we spent a couple of weeks there<br>teaching wasn't really set up for<br>surgery we did one operation<br>uh during the time i was there to wash<br>out a septic knee which took about a day<br>of preparation<br>here you can see julia helping ella draw<br>up the drugs for an awake<br>ketamine um anaesthetic and i assume<br>robbie has had more surgical bent was<br>waiting in the tea room for the patient<br>to be put to sleep<br>but it was an opportunity for the<br>children to travel<br>around and trek with us over the next<br>couple of weeks or so<br>and really see how the other half live<br>and<br>we had a wonderful time of course<br>with mountains there it was just too<br>good opportunity to miss<br>and so a friend of mine lydia brady<br>who's a very accomplished<br>mountaineer um came out and<br>we climbed ahmad iblam which is sits and<br>dominates the<br>lower uh kumbu and um<br>had two of the most exciting uh<br>campsites in the world uh<br>camp two here on a little rocky pinnacle<br>and camp three sitting right under the<br>ice fall of the dablam of amadoblam<br>at 6 000 meters and so we were<br>successful with that<br>and had a little bit of excitement on<br>the way down when we had to help rescue<br>a<br>um frostbitten austrian who had cerebral<br>edema<br>on the summit anyway unfortunate to come<br>back to the real world<br>and i became clinical leader in 2009 and<br>started making the front page of the<br>paper<br>a little too regularly for my managers<br>and generally under the guise of<br>academic articles on the problems facing<br>us regarding<br>and the problem is osteoarthritis it's<br>affects up to 15 percent of new<br>zealanders<br>it's said that the lifetime risk of<br>developing symptomatic osteoarthritis<br>for me is up to<br>47 and it's old people these are age<br>curves for the incidence of hip and knee<br>replacement<br>and it's a problem people generally<br>around the age of 65 or 70.<br>the population is projected to double to<br>a million of over 65s by the end of this<br>decade<br>this was from gary hooper's work um<br>the problem is the management of<br>osteoarthritis<br>there is very much management there is<br>no treatment there is no cure<br>so you can modify activities you can<br>lose weight hopefully<br>you can exercise you can use walking<br>aids<br>pain relief anti-inflammatories health<br>food supplements joint injections<br>magnetic underlays copper bracelets<br>aromatherapy crystals<br>whatever you like a lot of them work no<br>better than placebo but placebo works<br>better than nothing and i'm happy to<br>take that<br>if somebody gets better once you've got<br>a knee looking like this with a totally<br>destroyed medial compartment<br>incipient collapse of the bone or huge<br>osteophytes and a stiff knee in a 43<br>year old<br>or a femoral head which is no longer<br>round and has collapsed due to<br>a vascular necrosis then most of those<br>treatment options on the left aren't<br>going to cut it<br>and that's where joint replacement comes<br>in<br>and it's possible to take a patient like<br>this<br>who was a co-worker who's got<br>a slightly square head loss of joint<br>space<br>and various bone spurs large osteophytes<br>down around here<br>his femoral head looks like this with<br>ivory-shaped bone<br>and osteophytes around there and put in<br>a hip replacement<br>and this was a picture he sent me um<br>he's in the back row uh walking around<br>why carry moana<br>um with um a hip replacement in place<br>and his partner there or research<br>partner is also sitting in the audience<br>has got a hip of her own so three<br>between them<br>though i don't think you'd had yours by<br>that stage okay<br>so it's a fantastic intervention and the<br>patients tell us it's life transforming<br>and i have heard the words you have<br>given me my life back<br>so many times i think i actually believe<br>it<br>there's an orthopedic saying which<br>orthopedic adds life<br>to years we're not aiming to add years<br>to life<br>so you you may<br>not live any longer but you'll have a<br>lot more fun in the process<br>and you get excellent excellent<br>functional results most of the time and<br>usually we've got a very low<br>um infection sorry a complication rate<br>and a good implant survivor rate<br>there's a lot of drivers for this<br>increased demand out there age is the<br>big one<br>obesity increased patient expectations<br>and i like to say i blame the<br>cardiologists because almost all my<br>patients these days have had some stents<br>in<br>and probably 25 years ago these patients<br>would be dying<br>before they actually degenerated enough<br>to need a hip or knee replacement<br>so we're keeping people live longer and<br>this is driving the demand<br>the background is we've also got a<br>decrease in capacity the patients are<br>older and sicker and it takes longer to<br>anesthetize them<br>and the operation can take longer we've<br>got fewer staff<br>bids we've got lots of competing demands<br>and the<br>acutes we're dealing with are much more<br>complicated<br>and there's now an expectation that<br>trauma should be done within hours<br>rather than in the middle of the night<br>so what i would have happily done<br>at midnight or been expected to do by my<br>bosses<br>now everything waits until the following<br>day and this then leads to blowouts<br>which leads to electives being cancelled<br>and<br>i i don't think we should be doing<br>difficult surgery in the middle of the<br>night but we do need<br>extra capacity so gary hooper's paper<br>suggested that we were going to need to<br>do an extra 6 000 joint replacements a<br>year<br>by 2026 and as the average new zealand<br>surgeon does about 73<br>potentially we needed 80 new surgeons<br>just to do this workload<br>and the curve for knees is increasing<br>more rapidly<br>than for hip um hexby<br>abbott and ross wilson um<br>did some work looking expanding on this<br>and<br>modeling the demand and this is<br>basically what we're doing<br>hooper study and their model but this is<br>what the effect of obesity is having<br>assuming that the rates continue at the<br>current rate<br>so the demand is high and it's getting<br>higher<br>what's happening to the numbers we're<br>doing well the numbers are going up<br>but the rates are actually barely<br>keeping up with population<br>growth so a study i did again with<br>hacksby's group and helen<br>harkham was looking across new zealand<br>from uh publicly funded joint<br>replacement hip and near equal<br>in new zealand and it's pretty much flat<br>over that eight year period<br>the numbers were up but the rates<br>weren't in adults<br>when we look at otago you can see our<br>knees are lagging way behind our hips<br>which is partly to do with the increased<br>demand we've got here and the need to<br>prioritize<br>the conclusions from that study were<br>interesting<br>we found that the highest rates were<br>done<br>in maori in pa in patients from smaller<br>dhbs<br>and in the most devry deprived patient<br>uh<br>um in nz debt criteria<br>and the conclusion there was<br>geographical inequity across the country<br>but no systematic evidence of inequities<br>disadvantaging vulnerable<br>higher needs or isolated groups i think<br>the thing to take away from this<br>is this is only publicly funded and we<br>don't have good data on the private<br>sector so in large<br>cities there's probably a much higher uh<br>private sector<br>and so patients will be getting surgery<br>and the maori and disadvantage are<br>relying on the public system<br>uh southern is sitting down here over<br>that period<br>well below the national average for<br>intervention<br>so my first paper which caused a few<br>stairs was<br>trying to quantify the demand in otago<br>for hip and knee replacement<br>um in 2010 to 2012<br>and at this stage<br>the supply was based on a national<br>average<br>you should do this number based on<br>what the standardized intervention rate<br>is and i showed that because we had more<br>patients over the age of 55<br>and an unmet demand for previous years<br>when we didn't do our share<br>the backlog of patients led to this<br>problem where we had this<br>lack of we had this backlog<br>so what can we do to try and improve<br>this well<br>basically we can try and prevent it we<br>can improve non-operative management<br>we can prioritize or ration and we can<br>come more efficient with what we do<br>which unfortunately tends to mean try<br>and do more with less<br>i think we need to invest to try and do<br>a lot more with a little more<br>prevention there's not a lot we can do<br>about it so the sort of population<br>that we might see at the rugby players<br>who injure their knees<br>and have sporting injuries and<br>obesity and i think it's<br>imperative that we do address the<br>obesity epidemic<br>for a whole load of reasons and not just<br>orthopedics<br>so the joint clinic was part of the opp<br>and it was set up in conjunction with<br>hacksby as a senior but kathy chapel did<br>a lot of work in developing<br>a nurse and physioled clinic to improve<br>access to patients<br>to at least get into the system to be<br>assessed<br>hopefully we could improve the<br>non-management and non-operative<br>management of those patients<br>and maybe reduce the demand for surgery<br>it was based on evidence around at the<br>time and best practice and practice<br>guidelines<br>and we looked at the first two years of<br>patients<br>358 patients went through 40 percent<br>were referred<br>on for surgery so they were quite a<br>severe group of patients<br>and of those um 93<br>were recommended surgery so we felt that<br>the physios were doing a really good job<br>at prioritizing and triaging patients<br>and making the right decisions the<br>question was was<br>this helping the patients so we then<br>looked at the outcomes<br>and factors that influenced improvement<br>in non-operative management<br>so using various different scores hip<br>and knee<br>the dark blue is are the patients that<br>improved to a clinically relevant amount<br>the light blue the ones that<br>deteriorated by a clinically relevant<br>amount<br>more patients with knee osteoarthritis<br>improved<br>on each of the score that we used than<br>hip<br>and fewer patients with knee<br>osteoarthritis went on for surgery<br>so we concluded that we should direct<br>our efforts to patients with knee<br>osteoarthritis<br>rather than hippo a as they were going<br>to get a better outcome<br>and i was really glad with that founding<br>finding because i've been teaching that<br>to my<br>students for the previous 10 years and i<br>knew of no evidence that necessarily<br>said that<br>i don't think there's a great role uh<br>for physio for hip osteoarthritis<br>apart from in fairly early disease<br>so we followed this up with a five-year<br>study and<br>julia my daughter was a summer student<br>with us<br>and we reviewed those same patients at<br>five years<br>and we found that 75 percent of patients<br>with hip arthritis<br>had actually gone on to get surgery<br>during that time but over 50 percent<br>of patients with neoa were still being<br>managed non-operatively<br>which was a bit of a surprise<br>when we looked at the grade of<br>osteoarthritis grade 1 is the most mild<br>grade 4<br>is the most severe it didn't really<br>matter with hip they all deteriorated<br>patients with the most severe grade of<br>neo-a<br>ended up with surgery at about the same<br>rate as hip but in milder stages of neoa<br>they hadn't had surgery and hopefully<br>had improved<br>the question then really was is this<br>reflecting rationing and access problems<br>or have they truly improved<br>so um the before i was accused of<br>becoming non-surgical i thought we'd do<br>this study<br>um these are the baseline scores here<br>and here<br>in the non-operative group at five years<br>or seven years<br>the average score was no different the<br>patients had not deteriorated<br>but there'd be no significant<br>improvement in the operative group<br>they'd started a little bit worse<br>they'd got a lot worse and they were an<br>awful lot better at five years<br>than the patients that are continuing to<br>be managed non-operatively<br>so avoiding surgery i do not feel is a<br>good<br>endpoint for success of non-operative<br>treatment<br>if we've got an option that could make<br>so we work an environment of resource<br>constraint<br>the ministry guidelines say no patient<br>should wait more than four months for<br>surgery or for an appointment<br>but there's an out if you don't have<br>capacity they can be<br>returned to their gp and in turn they<br>get<br>sent back round and the idea is that the<br>patients have certainty<br>and tremaine hit the nail on the head<br>with this cartoon from the paper<br>where basically yes we can give you<br>certainty we're definitely not going to<br>be able to do your operation<br>even though we have advised it and this<br>creates<br>a huge amount of stress and waste<br>so scoring tools were developed i've<br>used them throughout my consultant<br>career<br>john claude was involved in the<br>development of a lot of them<br>and also paul hansen with his thousand<br>minds technology<br>and they all work to a degree until the<br>workload becomes too great for the<br>demand<br>and then we run into problems and<br>they're all relatively subjective<br>we've now moved on to one which is<br>supposed to prioritize every condition<br>in orthopedics<br>and using a similar impact of life score<br>from the patient to try and prioritize<br>referral letters now<br>to to have a try and work out who we<br>should even be seeing<br>so i looked at the nzoa score which was<br>introduced in 2008<br>which can give you a number of different<br>scores we had a<br>there were concerns that orthopedic<br>surgeons were scoring up their patients<br>unfairly<br>so we had a prioritization nurse kirsten<br>stout who did all of these scoring<br>and and basically this is the score if<br>you've got a score of over 71<br>you've got certainty if you've got 70<br>which was a common score<br>you were below the threshold because<br>there were too many people and you could<br>either be<br>overridden and given surgery or returned<br>to gp<br>and this group were all returned to gp<br>so these are the scores and we compared<br>those<br>in 608 patients with validated<br>uh condition specific scores such as the<br>oxford score and womec<br>and the concerning thing here was<br>although the school works<br>there's actually no difference between<br>the patients around the threshold<br>of the score of 70 or 71 so we're<br>actually it's a bit arbitrary as to<br>whether<br>somebody's going to get their operation<br>or not and of course in the community<br>you know if your neighbors got it and<br>she's not as bad as me<br>and so we've got to be very careful with<br>the scoring<br>what was the effect of the scoring well<br>we looked at all of these patients<br>uh that's in 1314 29 of hips 40<br>of these that were listed for surgery<br>were being<br>declined surgery and returned to their<br>gp<br>those patients getting it were<br>significantly worse than<br>our previous cohort of patients who were<br>getting surgery for the previous five<br>years<br>and those being returned would have got<br>surgery five years earlier<br>so it was getting harder to get an<br>operation we also showed that the demand<br>for joint replacement over this period<br>had increased by nearly 20 percent<br>since 2012.<br>so what happens to these patients i had<br>another summer student tony anna<br>tilia she looked at this with one of my<br>registrars 374 patients returned to gp<br>and at mean follow-up of uh<br>two years we found 52 percent had come<br>back round in a circle and had<br>public surgery um<br>some people had given up and decided to<br>self-fund and go privately<br>and a few more had been gone around the<br>circle and once again declined<br>only a third of patients were still<br>being treated by their gp<br>possibly semi-successfully and again<br>hips<br>were doing worse than these i hesitate<br>to say that people are dying waiting for<br>their operation<br>but two patients did die in the return<br>to gp group<br>without and without an operation<br>so is this prioritization or is it<br>rationing prioritization<br>a definition is that you order a cue by<br>using multiple criteria<br>and that's what our scoring system does<br>rationing occurs<br>when you've got a queue and there are<br>capacity constraints and you can't do<br>everybody<br>so i think we're rationing um<br>we know we can't do everybody but if<br>you're talking to a patient<br>they've got every reason in the world<br>why they are more deserving than the<br>next person<br>we're expecting the surgeons to do this<br>rationing at the point of care<br>and we've got a conflict between our<br>duty to the patient and our duty to the<br>dhb<br>of the government of the day which leads<br>to conflicts<br>there's no real public dialogue as to<br>who should be getting an operation or<br>not<br>we can look at more general outcome<br>measures like quality of life<br>and we can then start looking at cost<br>effectiveness of some of these<br>procedures that we do so joint<br>replacement is very expensive up front<br>but it's long lasting<br>physiotherapy is cheap<br>relatively and it's been shown to be<br>cost effective in the local moa study<br>it cost around twenty six thousand<br>dollars a year or one times gdp<br>per quali um at one or two years<br>we don't know the answer for other<br>orthopedic procedures and i've got<br>no idea of the cost per quali or cost<br>benefit and many other<br>interventions done in other specialties<br>so we looked at a prospective cohort<br>with data we'd had about 1200 patients<br>who underwent hip and knee replacement<br>we looked at their outcomes from the<br>joint registry<br>whether they died whether they'd revised<br>again ross did<br>most of this work and<br>not surprisingly if you have a poor<br>pre-op score<br>you end up with a poorer post-op<br>health-related quality of outcome score<br>but you get a bigger gain in score than<br>if you start off with less severe<br>disease<br>if you wait until you have a if you<br>referred with the score an oxford score<br>let's say of 25<br>and you wait until you get to 10 there's<br>an implication you're actually going to<br>get a worse<br>outcome in general health related<br>outcome score by being forced to wait<br>so you're losing quality of life while<br>you're waiting and you're losing quality<br>of life<br>afterwards if we look at cost<br>effectiveness<br>i can tell you that hip and knee<br>replacement in new zealand are not<br>cost effective at one year<br>seventy four thousand dollars for hip<br>replacement ninety three thousand<br>dollars for<br>knee replacement per quali at one year<br>however you might not be able to see the<br>dotted lines terribly well<br>they are cost effective by two years<br>and highly cost effective less than half<br>of gtp<br>per quali by three years onwards and at<br>every year<br>hip replacement is more cost effective<br>than knee replacement<br>and by the time you go out to 15 years<br>they're only costing about six thousand<br>dollars<br>what about pre-op status it's most<br>cost-effective in patients who are bad<br>beforehand but it's still highly<br>cost-effective in patients<br>who've got mild disease after four or<br>five years so the mild disease the<br>yellow<br>stars the red are the patients with the<br>worst<br>pre-operative scores and it's the same<br>for age surprising enough is actually<br>the young patients that have the<br>greatest improvement health health<br>related quality of life<br>and the most cost effective but older<br>patients<br>over 80 it's still cost effective by<br>so we've got a very effective and<br>cost-effective intervention so if we're<br>going to do it then we try<br>we need to try and reduce the impact on<br>the patient of this surgery<br>so this was the main project looking at<br>enhanced recovery which was all the buzz<br>about 2012. and ginny martin<br>and chris crane who i think are both<br>here um<br>did an awful lot of work they were the<br>program coordinator and facilitator and<br>i led it<br>to try and improve the patient journey<br>through surgery<br>anaesthetists were involved in trying to<br>improve how we do the anaesthetic and<br>how we<br>do the post-op analgesia we looked at<br>pre<br>pre-op education classes which we still<br>do and we<br>critically looked at our surgical<br>technique and also things like<br>rehabilitation and criteria based<br>discharge<br>our ward physiotherapist and our ward<br>staff really got on board with this<br>project<br>and it's a triumph of what you can do<br>if everybody gets on board so we looked<br>at a thousand patients<br>with hip and knee replacements 500<br>pre-eras 500<br>posters mainly looking at length of stay<br>these patients average age of 69 the<br>average bmi is 32. this is the reality<br>of what we're up who we're operating on<br>these days<br>31 were asa 3 and 4 which are<br>significantly unwell patients<br>our pre-op score was average score was<br>11 which is almost<br>um you know unheard of in places like<br>the uk for an<br>average pre-op score a length of stay<br>median<br>dropped to four days our discharge<br>rates were very similar to projects from<br>the uk<br>96 percent of our patients went home and<br>didn't go to step down facilities unlike<br>the us<br>where 30 to 40 percent of people will go<br>to a fancy hospital<br>rather than staying sorry fancy hotel<br>rather than stay in hospital and we<br>developed these programs over about a<br>year<br>and then went live and this is what's<br>been found all around the world the<br>effect was dramatic and almost<br>instantaneous as everybody bought in<br>to these changes we found a 20<br>reduction in bed nights which<br>unfortunately was offset<br>by the increase in elective admissions<br>and the increase in acute admissions<br>that happened so we could get more work<br>done<br>most importantly the patients were<br>really highly satisfied<br>nowadays if you have a hip or knee<br>replacement you are up walking that<br>night<br>and that is how it should be it's<br>wellness behavior we've given you a<br>little operation<br>you're going to get back straight on<br>your feet to do that they have to have<br>good<br>a good operation and good pain relief<br>we need to improve the results of our<br>surgery we can<br>we have to reduce complications in the<br>revision burden<br>we need better implant systems we need<br>to look at<br>fixation and bearing surface are two of<br>the things which the companies are<br>trying to<br>get us to change all the time and we<br>need to do our surgery better<br>if possible all of the joints in new<br>zealand go into the<br>national joint registry these are the<br>survivorship curves<br>of the joint hips on the right knees on<br>the left<br>145 000 knees hips registered in new<br>zealand<br>120 000 knees and you can't see the<br>small print but<br>84 percent of all knees hips done since<br>1999 in new zealand are unrevised<br>92 of all knees are unrevised<br>at 20 years now patients are censored at<br>the time of death<br>and a concept which people find amusing<br>is that in orthopedics a dead patient<br>with an intact hip replacement is a<br>success<br>basically as long as they've got out of<br>hospital<br>basically the operation has lasted them<br>for the rest of their days<br>and hopefully without problems so<br>there are complications unfortunately so<br>the commonest<br>reasons for early revision of failure is<br>dislocation of a hip replacement<br>and that is a real problem for the<br>patient a patient of mine dislocated in<br>his attic<br>uh down in milton and they had to call<br>the fire brigade to take the roof off<br>the house to get him out<br>which was quite a pallava and a bit<br>unfortunate<br>we all have dislocations some more than<br>others and it's a nuisance but we can do<br>something about it<br>periprosthetic fractures as in the<br>middle there are becoming epidemic<br>it's now commoner to have a<br>periprosthetic femoral fracture than a<br>femoral shaft fracture because there's<br>so many people out there<br>the new hip fracture is actually around<br>an implant<br>an infection as you can see here is an<br>absolute<br>disaster when you've got pus coming out<br>of a knee or a hip like this we've got a<br>huge problem<br>both surgically but particularly for the<br>patient<br>we're going to have to debride that<br>wound take all the implants out put<br>spaces in<br>weeks or months of antibiotic treatment<br>and so prevention<br>is much more important than cure some of<br>these are unavoidable<br>some are technical some are implant<br>related some are system related<br>some things we can have some choice in<br>so<br>if we look at contemporary hip<br>replacements we can use<br>my favorite here the cemented exodus<br>stem which is fantastic<br>we can use a cemented cup we can use<br>uncemented cups<br>you can use uncemented stems and we can<br>use ceramic on ceramic bearings<br>or metal or ceramic on plastic bearings<br>metal on metal was really popular 10<br>years ago and everybody would come in<br>saying i want a birmingham hip<br>replacement so i can run marathons<br>fortunately we didn't do i did nine and<br>found it a bit too hard<br>and i haven't revised any of mine<br>people found it a bit hard and started<br>using large diameter<br>metal heads which turned out to be an<br>absolute disaster<br>and this is where our joint registry was<br>really handy we hear these problems<br>but this is the survivorship for<br>different bearings this is metal on<br>metal<br>and it doesn't take long when you see a<br>curve like this<br>for the behavior to change instantly<br>and you will struggle to find a surgeon<br>putting in a metal or metal hip<br>in the country now we're still following<br>them out to 20 years<br>but this is the rate this is<br>highly cross-linked plastic these two<br>curves up here<br>and this is what we're almost always<br>doing this was conventional plastic so<br>our new plastics<br>are much better than those which we had<br>when i came back in<br>the early 2000s ceramic on ceramic was<br>interesting it was doing really well<br>but does appear to have dropped off<br>after about 15 or 16 years<br>and we're not quite sure why that is but<br>there are some idiosyncratic things<br>which can happen with<br>ceramic on ceramic bearings this is what<br>happens with a bad metal on metal hip i<br>visited a<br>friend in southampton this patient had<br>no symptoms at all<br>but he had an x-ray showing a hip with<br>full of liquid metal<br>this was the black gunge which was<br>aspirated from the hip at the time of<br>his operation<br>and this was the femoral component<br>surgeons in the room can see the<br>trunnion has basically been<br>worn away by the torque of this big<br>metal head<br>until it's just a little pointy beak<br>instead of a nice big trunnion like this<br>other people present with<br>sterile pus under pressure<br>in the hip or awful bone destruction and<br>soft tissue destruction around<br>so these are some of the things that can<br>go wrong<br>if we don't introduce things responsibly<br>the big debate which has been going on<br>for as long as i've been in orthopedics<br>is do we use cement or do we use<br>unsemented components the literature<br>still suggests we should use cemented<br>components we had a policy in this<br>hospital<br>for a number of years saying we should<br>use cement only based on best<br>practice at the time um surgeons don't<br>use cementite cups very much any longer<br>we noticed that our hips were beginning<br>to fail and it was mainly<br>aseptic loosening so maybe the evidence<br>is wrong these are the joint registry<br>curves showing that cement<br>or cementite is still doing as well or<br>better than uncemented<br>so a big study we looked at of 2000 hips<br>looking at the public and private showed<br>pretty convincingly<br>that this is the survival so sorry<br>revision rate<br>this is good this is bad these are<br>cemented cups these are uncemented cups<br>so we showed a clear difference with<br>uncemented<br>and we followed that up with a study<br>looking at the exeter which is a<br>really good stem and the survivorship of<br>uncemented cups much better than<br>cemented<br>and it was the same at different ages we<br>also need to improve the quality of<br>surgery so<br>every year we get a report from the<br>joint registry<br>which can be a worrying time on these<br>funnel plots<br>every dot is a surgeon in the country<br>the black line<br>is the national average if you're above<br>the red line you are significantly<br>worse and got a higher revision rate if<br>you're below the blue line<br>you're significantly better than the<br>national average<br>i can skype because i'm down here the<br>green dot<br>for both hips and both knees but i'm not<br>even the best surgeon in dunedin with<br>several of my colleagues<br>having better results than me so we're<br>very fortunate we're doing good surgery<br>and we've got tools like this to tell us<br>so how are we doing well this is the<br>graph of what we're managing in dunedin<br>we improved from 2014 up until 2019<br>and all of these things we've done made<br>a difference but it was also things like<br>the fact that we<br>commissioned an extra theater we<br>employed at least one extra surgeon and<br>we started outsourcing<br>you can see that our knee replacement<br>rate is still significantly below our<br>hip rate and it should be equal<br>and that's because we're prioritizing<br>hips over knees because they're more<br>severely<br>disabled and they do better<br>it's more cost effective we're doing a<br>shortfall of about a hundred knee<br>replacements a year across southern<br>as a rough estimate so what's the future<br>i'm afraid there is no magic bullet to<br>cure osteoarthritis<br>on the horizon stem cell research if<br>that's what you thought i was going to<br>talk about today<br>isn't going to work in end stage disease<br>age and obesity is rising the trauma<br>loads increasing<br>we're under increasing public pressure<br>and i think at some stage in the future<br>maybe we will be moving to acute only<br>hospitals<br>can i stem the tide in my chair of<br>orthopedic surgery<br>no i'm sorry<br>it's everybody's problem i think the<br>population have to take personal<br>responsibility they need to make some<br>lifestyle choices<br>they need to keep fit they need to avoid<br>obesity maybe you need to think that you<br>need to take out insurance or<br>self-funding because a<br>public sector may not be there for you<br>primary care have got a responsibility<br>to improve non-operative management<br>prevention of fractures will reduce our<br>workload<br>and we need appropriate referrals<br>secondary care we can prioritize and<br>ration<br>to a degree but maybe we need cost<br>effectiveness data and other things<br>to decide how we're going to allocate<br>that resource we'll continue to improve<br>our surgery and our complications and<br>our eras work<br>bottom line we've got to do more stuff<br>and that means more work more resource<br>more theaters it needs to be sustainable<br>planned<br>and budgeted we're trying to provide a<br>first class service on economic cost<br>funding and something's going to give if<br>i'd like to acknowledge my colleagues<br>i work in a fantastic department and it<br>has been an absolute<br>pleasure to work with all of these<br>people you may not recognize all of them<br>um snow white swan um<br>uh doc tice uh and a few others<br>um our current leader gangnam style of<br>michael chin<br>um and we have a lot of fun and this has<br>been really good in keeping the<br>department going i think sean claude has<br>an awful lot<br>to thank for getting the department in<br>the places it was and i've really<br>just taken over i'd like to acknowledge<br>all my co-workers<br>my academic colleagues and heads of<br>department and the ortho girls and one<br>in particular<br>who's been there on the first day that i<br>arrived as a registrar<br>and the last day as i made a cup of tea<br>before coming out of the office and<br>arahan mikel has been there the whole<br>time<br>she runs all of the teaching and takes<br>all the workload for me<br>and as allah said to me everybody needs<br>an araha<br>so thank you but also jenny chris<br>kirsten and the rest of the ortho girls<br>and all the nursing and theatre staff<br>and i see a few people are here<br>and i'd like to thank my patients<br>because this is what makes my job so<br>worthwhile<br>and finally my biggest supporters of my<br>family<br>and i'm glad that they're here today<br>they're both following in our footsteps<br>both medically and in an outdoor active<br>lifestyle<br>and they've been there the whole time<br>during this journey even if i've been<br>so thank you very much this is what life<br>might have been a year ago with kovid<br>fortunately we're in a much better<br>position<br>up uh mihi nui david for your<br>ipo and also happy birthday um it's his<br>birthday today<br>so that's fantastic sort of coincidence<br>um but um<br>david's taken us through a journey of<br>orthopedic surgery in relation to joint<br>replacements and<br>i have to acknowledge his determination<br>and perseverance and resource<br>constrained environment to do this<br>research and to do the clinical work and<br>i guess there's perhaps some parallels<br>with his um<br>his private life and his coast to coast<br>running in his climbing mountains that<br>that sort of grit and determination<br>um is what it takes to accomplish his<br>academic work as well<br>and sometimes on the surface of it with<br>him as you saw when he made some<br>slightly sort of<br>throwaway comments about ethics<br>committees that sometimes he's a bit<br>rogue<br>but underneath that he's very clever<br>and he's very wise and that always comes<br>out when you sort of<br>might be wide-eyed at his first comment<br>um but he<br>he is a pragmatic pragmatic sort of guy<br>and he's a realist<br>and you get that up front you don't get<br>the uh over positive<br>flowery sort of stuff from david so<br>that's good<br>so um thank you very much david<br>and now i have a gift to present you<br>which is uh not a birthday present<br>so uh i would uh now like to invite you<br>all to come over to the staff club for<br>refreshments and drinks<br>and thank you very much for attending</p></main><footer
