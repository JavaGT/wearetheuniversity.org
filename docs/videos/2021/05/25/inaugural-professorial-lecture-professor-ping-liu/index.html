Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid with several bioactive metabolites. Ping’s group has been working in the areas of arginine metabolism and aging, neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders, using post-mortem human brain tissue, human biofluids and various animal models via a multidisciplinary approach. Her research to date has implicated the alterations of brain arginine metabolism in the process of normal aging and in the pathogeneses of Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia. Ping and her collaborators are currently exploring the potential use of blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers centered on arginine metabolism for clinical diagnosis and prognosis of both diseases. Moreover, her team has been investigating the role of decarboxylated arginine in maintaining healthy aging and its therapeutic potential for Alzheimer’s disease.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

the university otago it's my great<br>pleasure to welcome you all to this<br>special occasion to celebrate ping lu's<br>promotion to professor<br>and it's good to see so many of ping's<br>colleagues students and friends<br>but i'd like to give a special welcome<br>to ping's family<br>her parents and brothers in china nihao<br>and to her family here with us so her<br>husband<br>who her sons wei and xing<br>her daughter-in-law jessalyn and her<br>parents eka amimi<br>hani's tong and her brother and<br>sister-in-law<br>ming and ewen it's lovely that you can<br>join us all<br>so some of you will have heard me say<br>before that promotion to professor<br>at the university is not easily achieved<br>and ping<br>has gone through a rigorous process to<br>demonstrate that she is worthy of this<br>promotion<br>a process that involves seeking feedback<br>from external referees across the world<br>and inaugural professorial lectures are<br>always<br>um wonderful opportunities for us all to<br>take time<br>to learn about the research our amazing<br>colleagues do<br>this ipl is particularly special to me<br>because i was head of a department of<br>anatomy<br>and on the panel that appointed ping as<br>a lecturer in 2005.<br>and as a consequence i've followed her<br>career and development with interest<br>so while prof um professor hyland's<br>going to provide a formal introduction<br>i'd like to add a few personal comments<br>about ping first<br>so professor liu is a gifted<br>neuroscientist<br>and she and i used to have labs very<br>close to each other<br>and i quickly saw her strong work ethic<br>and the care that she gave to her<br>students<br>and these qualities have resulted in<br>many publications<br>in terms of her teaching when ping first<br>came to anatomy<br>she already had a strong research track<br>record<br>but had very limited teaching experience<br>and i'm sure she won't mind me telling<br>you that her early teaching evaluations<br>were not stellar<br>however it's her response that impressed<br>me<br>she sought advice and help put in an<br>amazing amount of work<br>and now her teaching evaluations are<br>some of the best<br>and as one of her referees comments<br>as well as being a busy academic and a<br>mum<br>ping has also made significant<br>contributions to the community in<br>dunedin particularly the chinese<br>community<br>so when her children were younger she<br>was involved and at one stage the<br>president of the chinese language school<br>she's a member of the chinese cultural<br>and arts association<br>and you can often see her performing at<br>various<br>chinese festivals but she's also<br>contributed to the life of the<br>university<br>so she's part of the dunedin chinese<br>student<br>and scholar association and she and who<br>have quietly supported many<br>international chinese students as well<br>as assisting the university<br>with hosting our visiting delegations<br>so thank you ping for your support so<br>it's a pleasure<br>it's been a pleasure for me working with<br>you i'd like to add my congratulations<br>to your promotion<br>and i'd also like to ask brian to come<br>greetings greetings to you all it is<br>indeed<br>my great privilege and pleasure to have<br>the role to introduce<br>professor pinglu's inaugural<br>professorial lecture<br>ping graduated with bachelor of medicine<br>in china<br>in 1985 and worked as a physician<br>for eight years in clinical geriatric<br>practice<br>before completely removing herself from<br>china migrating<br>to new zealand and embarking on a<br>complete<br>transmographation change it's too<br>complicated to work<br>in career so she embarked on a<br>completely new direction<br>in neurobiology research embarking on a<br>phd<br>with professor dave bilke here in the<br>department of psychology<br>she completed that in a good time in<br>1997<br>and in fact it was an outstanding phd<br>and on the back of this outstanding phd<br>in which she published seven<br>full papers she received a two-year<br>health research council career<br>development post-doctoral fellowship<br>in 1999 which she used to support<br>further work<br>in professor bilkey's laboratory for the<br>post-doctoral<br>study that was followed by five years<br>post-doctoral research<br>in the department of pharmacology and<br>toxicology over with us<br>in the school of biomedical sciences in<br>the laboratories<br>of professors paul smith and cynthia<br>darlington<br>as already noted following that she was<br>sort of snapped up<br>by the department of anatomy and<br>appointed to a lectureship in 2005<br>promoted to senior lecturer in 2010 and<br>associate professor<br>in 2015.<br>as we've noted already tonight and on<br>multiple other occasions<br>promotion to professor requires<br>sustained outstanding<br>leadership and performance as assessed<br>not only by our local<br>committee promotions committee but by<br>international<br>independent uh reviewers<br>so just quickly summarizing some of the<br>highlights of<br>ping's achievements and teaching<br>leadership<br>which has been mentioned already at<br>divisional level<br>ping has served a long-standing role as<br>convener<br>for the nervous system block module in<br>the<br>mbchb the medical program<br>which is not part of the school but is a<br>contribution that she makes<br>into the medical program as part of the<br>division of health sciences<br>and that's a major challenge not only<br>because<br>it's considered by the students the most<br>challenging<br>content-wise but also<br>it involves a whole lot of clinicians<br>and<br>academics who have to be marshaled<br>into into the appropriate place at the<br>appropriate time<br>year on year out so it's<br>is a major contribution to medical<br>training here in new zealand that ping<br>has provided over those years within the<br>department she served as chair of the<br>departmental teaching committee and<br>convene multiple papers over the course<br>of her career<br>in the department and as we<br>often say we combine into teaching<br>that is nurturing our postgraduate<br>students through into their careers and<br>ping has an<br>excellent record there as well having<br>mentored<br>multiple phds to completion i think<br>she's got five<br>on the go at the moment three masters<br>students<br>multiple honours students in their<br>laboratory and they've they've<br>displayed very high levels of<br>achievement<br>reflecting the level of support that<br>ping provides to them<br>now in research outputs and recognition<br>ping has funded her work with a<br>succession of external grants<br>including being co-principal<br>investigator on an hrc<br>program grant and project funding from<br>the neurological foundation<br>of new zealand and mbie and she's<br>engaged as<br>all of our professors do but it's uh<br>it's always worth commenting on<br>local and international collaborations<br>which<br>mean that she's feeding into others<br>research and taking<br>from others in terms of building a<br>so all this input money collaborations<br>and so on<br>has led to a string of high-impact<br>publications over 70 peer-reviewed<br>journal articles with a very high<br>proportion of them as first or senior<br>author<br>reflecting leadership of the research<br>highly cited papers so h<br>index are for those of you who are<br>interested in those sorts of new<br>numerics of 29 at the time of applying<br>for promotion<br>and these are occurring in journals such<br>as neuropharmacology<br>translational psychiatry neurobiology of<br>aging<br>oxidative medicine schizophrenia<br>research<br>and scientific reports and so on and<br>those titles reflect not only the<br>quality of the journals but also the<br>subject matter of her research<br>and its link through to clinical<br>application<br>so ping's research has focused on the<br>role of arginine metabolism<br>in the aging of the brain normal aging<br>but how altered metabolism of arginine<br>may contribute to degenerative disorders<br>such as alzheimer's and other chronic<br>problems including neuropsychiatric<br>disorders<br>and as penguin will no doubt explain<br>arginine is an amino acid<br>structural component of proteins in the<br>body<br>and it's associated through its<br>metabolic pathways with the generation<br>of many other bioactive molecules such<br>as nitric oxide<br>agmatine and polyamines<br>and a particular emphasis in ping's work<br>is exploring<br>on the one hand how the levels of those<br>substances in the body and how changes<br>in their level<br>could be used as biomarkers in other<br>words<br>ways of tracking the progression or the<br>prognosis of a disease<br>that could be accessed easily from the<br>body fluids<br>but also on the other hand how some<br>aspects might be protective<br>of disease and therefore could offer<br>potential therapeutic approaches<br>for these studies she brings to bear a<br>wide range<br>of methods extending from animal models<br>to work in human samples and postmortem<br>tissue<br>so in her lecture this evening ping i'm<br>sure will give us an overview of her<br>research<br>but she wishes to focus in particular on<br>her work<br>on arginine and its metabolic pathways<br>in processes of normal aging and in<br>neurodegeneration<br>and the potential clinical applications<br>once again it's my pleasure and<br>privilege to introduce to you<br>professor ping liu to deliver her<br>thank you very much helen and fly for<br>your very kind and introduction and also<br>all of your support<br>so life's a journey my journey has<br>not been simple and easy i have to say<br>i would like to use this opportunity to<br>thank you all for coming<br>and i really want to thank everyone you<br>know who has supported me<br>on this journey so um<br>thank you very much for coming and for<br>this very<br>special occasion of my academic life<br>so today is a very special day the 20th<br>of<br>may in chinese we call it<br>so i just want to say i love you<br>all today okay<br>and especially i want to thank you know<br>my families i love you all my three boys<br>my husband who and my two boys<br>way and shane and my lovely<br>daughter-in-law jessalyn so i used this<br>photo you know as her and wedding photos<br>and also her parents mimi and erica they<br>are here today thank you very much<br>some of you probably don't know i have<br>quite big<br>family in new zealand my brother-in-law<br>associate professor ming jam<br>and my sister-in-law even and their<br>family<br>to ali and max<br>and heim my sister-in-law mae<br>and her daughter e and this is my<br>younger brother and his<br>daughter tong to has been here with me<br>for five years<br>so i think tong you are my daughter now<br>okay i want to<br>thank to my family in china<br>so this is my father uh and my<br>um young brother liu jian and his wife<br>young may and another younger brother<br>liu young and<br>his um wife jialam that<br>they are going to watch my ipl<br>live stream i don't think they<br>understand chinese but<br>i do believe they must be very very<br>happy to see me<br>okay so i want to thank my mother<br>jolene who passed away many many years<br>ago<br>and i want to thank my parents-in-law<br>darley and zomi they have supported me<br>enormously during my journey<br>so you haven't left us but i don't think<br>you know you really have<br>so just in case if i run out of time i<br>would like to thank<br>my team my<br>current and past student you know<br>everyone on the um<br>on the screen and also staff members<br>highlight in the red box<br>thank you very much for all of your hard<br>work okay<br>i am here today it's really because of<br>you<br>thank you very much i also want to thank<br>the department's anatomy<br>psychology pharmacology and toxicology<br>at the school of pharmacy<br>and i thank founding bodies and a couple<br>of research centers<br>health research council neurologic<br>foundation lottery health brain health<br>um research in new zealand and brain<br>health research center<br>and ncdcrcc's long term it's a new<br>new zealand china non-communal disease<br>called operation center<br>so my early life i was born in ang hui<br>so this is a photo i think 100 days<br>when i was at 100 a day as you can see<br>from this map of china<br>my parents were separated 4 000<br>kilometers away<br>okay so when i was young uh my mother<br>basically looked after me and also my<br>two<br>younger brothers so this is a photo<br>uh when i was uh three years old with my<br>parents i couldn't find<br>many family photos with my parents just<br>because my father<br>could only visit us once<br>a year about one month but he had to<br>spend about eight days<br>so my two younger brothers they were<br>three years and five years<br>old younger than me when<br>the most time my mother had to look<br>after us which is very very difficult<br>and sometimes my grandmother came to<br>help<br>and sometimes my mother sent us to my<br>grandmother's<br>place so it's kind of mixture travel<br>around<br>so when i was uh 10 years old<br>finally my parents got together so my<br>whole family moved to<br>the south part of ang hui and called<br>huangshan easten and huangjang called<br>the yellow mountain<br>is the most beautiful mountain in china<br>it's very famous because it has<br>beautiful the sea of clouds<br>and very beautiful rocks and also pine<br>trees<br>so my hometown is also pretty and has<br>been regarded as a paradise in the world<br>and painting in the countryside it was a<br>very beautiful place<br>and another thing is you know my<br>hometown has so<br>many probably over 100 several hundred<br>well-preserved qing and main dynasty<br>houses<br>okay it's a very very special place i<br>was in eastern for<br>six years i finished my high school<br>so this is my high school my class so<br>this is the top class<br>okay and not many girls in that class<br>i did really well for the national<br>college entry examination<br>so finally i went to<br>herve which is the capital city of hui<br>for my university<br>life so those photos<br>are me and the this this side i was 16<br>years old when i started the medical<br>school and i have to say medicine wasn't<br>my choice at that time was<br>absolutely my mother's choice because<br>soon after my family moved to eastern<br>and my mother's health condition just<br>declined<br>dramatically so he basically struggled a<br>lot with her own health<br>so she would like me to do medicine and<br>to be a doctor so which can help the<br>family and<br>in the future can help my own family so<br>although at start<br>medicine wasn't my choice and later on i<br>thoroughly enjoyed all of the medical<br>curriculum<br>i think in my year we had 300<br>medical students so this is my small<br>class<br>30 students okay in my small class<br>and you could only see six girls in the<br>class not many girls<br>so this is me in the front gate of angry<br>medical<br>college so now angry medical college has<br>been renamed<br>as angry medical university so this is<br>how the university looks like<br>so algae medical university has always<br>been the top<br>university top medical university in my<br>province<br>so audrey provincial hospital i had my<br>final internship year in<br>provincial hospital then i worked there<br>for eight years as a<br>as a physician so this is a photo<br>so now the hospital looks like and this<br>is the old one<br>so we call the department of geriatrics<br>at their time<br>called the gargantuan bean farm which<br>what this means means the<br>department served for senior officer<br>i was lucky enough to be to be selected<br>to work in this department because we<br>want good people<br>responsible people to work for the<br>senior<br>offices so this entire building actually<br>was for<br>the department of geriatrics so most of<br>the rooms in a single room or<br>two bedrooms very very good high<br>standard at that time<br>so during this time my life changed a<br>lot<br>i found my husband<br>and one year later i had my first child<br>shane and was lovely but<br>sadly is my mother passed away<br>in 1991 after seven years in<br>out of the hospital because of a liver<br>problem<br>so i would like to thank all of my<br>colleagues in<br>antwerp provincial hospital and that was<br>a very difficult time i had lots of<br>support<br>from my friends and colleagues in this<br>hospital<br>and i also want to thank who for going<br>through this very very difficult time<br>with me<br>so in 1993 october<br>i had to follow my husband so i<br>way and i would basically travel from<br>china you know<br>about 10 000 kilometers away and finally<br>to<br>duni and two months later<br>my parents-in-law lee and me were here<br>okay so at that time you know my<br>brother-in-law maine and even were<br>already here and the water house<br>so for quite some time i think several<br>months you know everyone should be<br>it means house for several months<br>so at that time you know i really<br>struggled you know i was<br>pretty uh worried about what what could<br>i do<br>you know because my english was really<br>really poor<br>and uh and maine said well you probably<br>need to think about<br>and to find talk to people and find<br>a suitable project for you so you could<br>do like research<br>redevelop your career then i did<br>i sent a couple of letters around and<br>david bierke<br>at that time he was a lecturer in the<br>department and department of psychology<br>and i think we met two days ago after<br>doris's ipl<br>i asked david well you were so brave to<br>offer me a full-time job you know why<br>what made you do to offer me a full-time<br>job because i had no<br>experience at all for research<br>that was really an interesting<br>experience<br>and david said well i still remember<br>your first you know first meeting<br>and you were very very quiet to probably<br>struggle with your english<br>and your must your husband did most of<br>right so i think worked i worked it with<br>david for a couple of months it's kind<br>of a volunteer work<br>and then david offered me a part-time<br>job<br>then david got three years i think it<br>was hrc<br>uh grant and he was really really<br>interested in paranormal context and<br>spatial<br>learning and memory so i took the<br>full-time job and at the same time i did<br>full-time phd with david<br>good thing is i did not let david down<br>i had seven publications from my phd<br>okay and uh so i think i submitted<br>my phd thesis in january 1988 and david<br>asked me to submit a hardband one<br>and luckily my thesis<br>was accepted no revision so i was very<br>pleased<br>for that so at that time<br>my big family had three people<br>during phd me my husband and also my<br>sister-in-law even<br>as you can see my parents-in-law<br>so they were here to help us to look<br>after children<br>okay i really want to thank them once<br>more<br>so so why parabonal cortex and<br>spatial memory so this is the human<br>brain<br>okay and this is the lateral view of the<br>human brain so the temporal lobe is here<br>and you can see this part and called a<br>hippocampus<br>so if we make a cut and you can see this<br>is the medial<br>part of the temporal lobe and there are<br>a number of important structures<br>for learning and memory so the<br>hippocampus<br>internal cortex parallel cortex and also<br>parahippocampal cortex<br>at that time we know the hippocampus is<br>really critical for spatial learning and<br>memory<br>however the role of pararinal cortex in<br>spatial learning and memory wasn't very<br>very clear<br>so my phd used red as a model the red<br>brain is quite small however the general<br>neural<br>connectivity was very very similar to<br>human brain<br>so i carried out an electrical<br>physiological study<br>so basically i showed<br>there is a direct projection from the<br>paragon cortex<br>to the hippocampus and this pathway<br>contributes to the lateral protein path<br>which is a major pathway from the cortex<br>to the hippocampus<br>this pathway and also supports long-term<br>potentiation which is a mechanism<br>underlying learning and memory<br>then i did another set of study<br>so i basically used electronic<br>otherwise it's a drug lesion okay<br>arbitantic escalation<br>and make lesions specific to this area<br>called the peril cortex<br>then test animals in the different kinds<br>of learning and memory<br>tasks so my work showed the parallel<br>relation produced<br>spatial learning and memory deficits so<br>collectively<br>my work supports the parallel cortex<br>contributions to spatial memory<br>i think this period was really really um<br>helpful for me to<br>have a really good understanding about<br>the brain anatomy and of the function<br>okay and i learned a lot about the<br>behavioral neuroscience<br>so after phd as brian introduced<br>i had two year postdoc with david<br>i think i worked on the post rhino<br>cortex and pre and paracetamol<br>so those structures are the other<br>structures that also belongs to the<br>medial temporal lobe memory system<br>then i applied for a two-year<br>fellowship which is a health risk<br>council career development<br>and from now on i worked with paul and<br>david the project was about the carolina<br>cortex and<br>alzheimer's disease so this is my first<br>project on alzheimer's disease<br>so after that the funding ran out<br>and one day cynthia came to me<br>and said we just received three um<br>hrc grant would you like to join us to<br>do something different<br>i said yes it was quite exciting<br>so i joined paul and cynthia's group<br>and worked on the vestibular hippocampal<br>interaction<br>so in our inner ear there has a<br>structure called you know<br>vegetable apparatus so if<br>any relation to the vestibular neuron<br>apparatus can cause balance problem and<br>can also affect the hippocampal function<br>as well<br>so my work along with my sister-in-law<br>even so she worked in for instance lab<br>as well<br>and we basically showed you know some<br>neurochemical changes in the hippocampus<br>following this uh<br>vestibular lesions<br>so at that time dr ian appleton<br>was in the department of pharmacology<br>and toxicology<br>he was the expert in the area of<br>arginine<br>metabolism i think my work on arginine<br>metabolism and brain aging was basically<br>developed<br>so i had my second<br>sound sheen um<br>at the end of 2003 so this is a shane<br>had your first birthday in the child<br>care so for my second child<br>the pregnancy was really really<br>difficult okay i almost died on the<br>surgery table<br>i had a five liter blood transfusion<br>okay when i had a shame that was<br>was very very difficult but we are here<br>actually<br>right so after phd i had 20 publications<br>and most of the papers you know was<br>myself as<br>first author although i worked very hard<br>i had a great time in david vikki's lab<br>and also paul<br>and cynthia's lab i don't know whether<br>you can see this is a david<br>and you must be drunk can you realize<br>here<br>so lots of parties okay and this is the<br>even so if you don't know<br>what um vestibular<br>a process looks like this is the<br>vestibular<br>okay the pink one so that was a great<br>time<br>so after that i said well i probably<br>need to move on<br>i would like to make a change i want to<br>have my own lab so i applied for the<br>lectureship<br>so as helen mentioned my research record<br>was great<br>but i didn't really have any teaching<br>experience okay<br>basically zero so when she was<br>14 months old i joined anatomy<br>so thank you very much helen for hiring<br>me<br>and also being a mentor for many many<br>years after that so i'm going to make my<br>boy a little bit<br>embarrassed because shane just got sick<br>all the time<br>you probably don't believe we had to<br>visit the doctor<br>every month until he was three years old<br>so many at that time i basically<br>prepared a very large yellow bag<br>with everything inside are really scared<br>to receive phone calls from a child care<br>because if i receive phone calls must be<br>something wrong machine<br>so that was very very difficult because<br>teaching was new i had to set up<br>a research lab and also look after this<br>young<br>child right but you know be strong<br>i am here now okay pass through that<br>very difficult<br>period so during my life in the<br>department of anatomy<br>i have had a number of hods<br>professor david green orshort she's here<br>in the<br>audience we also have peter hurst i<br>think<br>as acting hod for short period<br>and dave greten neogamo and current<br>hld lisa right i really want to thank<br>you<br>all for your support over the years<br>and finally i have a lap<br>i also want to thank the linda<br>ferguson fourth floor girls dorothy<br>marilyn and author snapper so during my<br>early years in the department<br>i had lots of help and support<br>from dorothy maryland and ruth nepper<br>i want to thank marilyn in particular<br>because in maryland at that time<br>really was my shoulder her door was<br>always open to me<br>when i had questions i could just get in<br>and marilyn<br>help you know she always helped<br>so during my time in the anatomy i<br>further developed my research in the<br>area of argentine metabolism<br>in the brain aging and neurodegenerative<br>and psychiatric disorders<br>so this is my research group and we had<br>some lovely photos over the years<br>okay and some students came go and<br>others still stay here and thank you<br>very much i said before<br>and really your work you know you have<br>made me here today<br>so now i'll talk about science a little<br>bit what is aging<br>aging is an inevitable network process<br>okay so everyone has this<br>process born<br>and grow up and being adult<br>at some point our you know the functions<br>of<br>our body system basically declines so my<br>work is really just interested in<br>this part of our life and i am more<br>interested in brain aging<br>so as you know when we get old we tend<br>to learn slowly<br>and probably forget quickly this is the<br>so red or mice we also showed similar<br>symptoms so therefore we can use red as<br>a model<br>to study brain aging<br>so this is my diagram just to show you<br>the cognitive<br>containment you know for some people<br>when we are getting old we don't really<br>notice any cognitive changes over time<br>okay<br>however most people probably do<br>experience<br>certain kind of age associated concrete<br>decline<br>however for some people they probably<br>show you know<br>more severe cognitive impairment or<br>called mild counter impairment which is<br>really relative<br>to the people you know in your age<br>right they show probably more severe<br>cognitive impairment so most people can<br>stay quite stable<br>for a long time and some people even<br>have<br>improved cognitive function over time<br>however small pro for small proportion<br>basically<br>their cognitive function just declined<br>further and<br>we think this is alzheimer's disease so<br>basically mci<br>and also ad we describe those conditions<br>so dementia is really like a big<br>umbrella name<br>okay to describe a group of cognitive<br>impairment<br>symptoms so at the moment in new zealand<br>for probably there are 70 000 people<br>suffering from<br>dementia it has been projected by<br>2050 there would be 1070 000 people<br>living with dementia so alzheimer's<br>disease is the most<br>common form okay under the umbrella of<br>dementia<br>it is a neurodegenerative disorder<br>that's character characterized by<br>increasing memory loss and<br>aging is a major risk factor as you can<br>see from this diagram here<br>at age 65 probably one percent<br>okay or population 80.<br>however you can see the numbers just<br>increases<br>when the ages goes up<br>so said so if you look at compare the<br>normal brain<br>and also enzymes brain and you can see<br>there's a significant<br>atrophy okay relative to the normal<br>but if we slice the brain and use a<br>certain<br>method to look at some pathological<br>profiles and you can see<br>amyloid plaques and also neurofibrillary<br>tangles<br>present in the brain as well<br>so sadly enzyme disease at this stage is<br>no<br>cure and it of course is also<br>not very clear at the stage it has been<br>proposed<br>you know amyloid beta probably placed a<br>central and costable role in ad<br>development however this hypothesis has<br>been challenged<br>increasingly over the years<br>so there are a number of challenges in<br>a.d field<br>for example the exact cause of ada and<br>early diagnosis we don't really have a<br>very good tool<br>for early diagnosis and prevention and<br>so i would like to give you a little bit<br>background so you understand my<br>following talk<br>i would like to introduce the first<br>protein called<br>amyloid precursor protein so everyone<br>in our brain we have app okay the short<br>term is app<br>and app can be cut off by<br>a couple of enzymes just like physics<br>you can cut here or cut here<br>so normally app can you know will be<br>cleaved by alpha and gamma securities<br>to produce this very very small peptide<br>which can be cleaved<br>so in the alzheimer's conditions however<br>this protein<br>enzyme okay and also followed by the<br>gamma securities<br>to produce this relatively larger amino<br>acid<br>peptide we call the amyloid beta so<br>amyloid bed is quite sticky<br>and under some conditions they can form<br>large aggregates<br>okay present in the brain therefore can<br>affect<br>so the other protein i would like to<br>talk about the called tau protein<br>and this side shows you know a neuron we<br>have dendrites we can receive the<br>information from<br>other neurons and this is in the body<br>and the neuron has a very long axon and<br>there's an end part<br>called axonal terminal can contact with<br>other neurons<br>so the microtubule and shown here<br>a very very important structure in the<br>axons<br>basically allows you know some nutrient<br>or neurotransmitters produced here<br>and transmit down to the end part of<br>that neuron<br>so tower protein is really important to<br>so in the ad condition all those<br>proteins<br>becomes problematic okay<br>so lots of function therefore cannot<br>stabilize this<br>microtubule as you can see in the ad<br>conditions all of the microtubules<br>just broken and the tail protein<br>forms aggregates so if you you<br>use some very specific method<br>you can see all those ghost tangles in<br>the brain<br>and eventually that neuron just died<br>so another important point i would want<br>to say<br>is the amount of tangles parallels the<br>duration and also severity<br>of alzheimer's disease is not the plugs<br>so what is what is the cause of ada so<br>in the past amyloid cascade hypothesis<br>has been the leading one<br>however this hypothesis has been<br>challenged<br>dramatically so this publication in 2014<br>basic says you know the amyloid<br>hypothesis<br>time to move on amyloid is the<br>downstream result<br>not cause of alzheimer's disease so the<br>basic thing is you know<br>many many industries they want to<br>develop some drug to treat alzheimer's<br>they only focus on the amyloid cascade<br>side<br>and no single clinical trial was<br>successful<br>so this paper says you know probably we<br>need to think about a microvascular part<br>because the brain lots of neurons we<br>need<br>to have very good blood supply to<br>maintain the normal<br>cellular function so later on there was<br>another hypothesis come out<br>and the two head vascular<br>model of alzheimer's disease dementia<br>so this idea was<br>probably for alzheimer's disease<br>remember for<br>ad 95 percent of alzheimer's disease<br>patients<br>they are old okay and we cause sporadic<br>and late onset alzheimer's disease<br>so aging should be the major risk factor<br>so they think vascular cerebral vascular<br>damage is the initial trigger<br>which is a third one then can affect<br>the a better process and leads to<br>the more production of amyloid and<br>remember the thrombovascular damage<br>itself can affect neuronal function<br>okay and also leads to the neural<br>degeneration<br>so why argenic metabolism<br>so arginine is a semi-essential<br>amino acid present probably in every<br>cell in our body<br>and this amino acid can be metabolized<br>by the enzyme<br>called the nitric oxide sensates in the<br>short terms in north<br>and with the production of citrulline<br>and no<br>no is a gas okay it's a gaseous molecule<br>so in 1998 no was a star<br>because three researchers around the<br>world<br>independently discovered nitric oxide<br>you know is the signaling molecule in<br>the cardiovascular system<br>and all those three received nobel prize<br>in physiology or medicine in 1998.<br>that was really really exciting<br>so now we know nitric oxide is not just<br>present in the cardiovascular system<br>it's also present in the brain<br>and the nitric oxide is very important<br>for<br>the nervous system development so if we<br>talk about<br>the the iso form of a noise there are<br>three isoforms<br>three types and n means you know<br>neuronal noise and e<br>means in the cellular cells in the blood<br>vessel okay<br>the e-loss and the enos derived<br>nitric oxide plays a very very important<br>role<br>in terms of maintaining cerebral blood<br>flow<br>we need to have normal blood flow in<br>order to<br>maintain our normal brain function so no<br>is also involved<br>in the neurotransmitter release learning<br>and memory<br>however this gas gaseous molecule is<br>kind of a double-edged sword it's<br>too high particularly in the no produced<br>by this ionos<br>can be neurotoxic and leads to<br>neurodegeneration<br>on the other side if no derived from the<br>enough from the blood vessels too low<br>can<br>affect cerebral blood flow therefore<br>we cannot function normally<br>so after i finish my phd there were a<br>couple of<br>papers published and one is about<br>nitric oxide hypothesis of aging so wow<br>this is very very interesting<br>and the other paper published in 2001<br>the cno<br>say nitric oxide to alzheimer's disease<br>the putative links between no and<br>dimension of enzymes type<br>so the other day when i prepare my ipl<br>well how do i know how did i know<br>no and southern i remembered when even<br>and i worked in the lab and she<br>mentioned nitric oxide<br>i thought really really interesting i<br>searched for more<br>so i worked on this<br>so again um that was my plan initially<br>after a while i probably could look at<br>you know young compare the noise changes<br>in uh between young<br>and aged rats try to look at how<br>argentine metabolism changed in age the<br>brain<br>and yin told me pain do you know<br>argentine can be metabolized by<br>another enzyme called arginase to<br>form anything and urea if you are going<br>to do<br>nausea probably it's better to look at<br>artinis as well because<br>north and argenis they compete in the<br>same substrate<br>i thought this is a good idea okay yes i<br>did<br>so at that time we are so good in terms<br>of<br>creating small you know bits of tissue<br>from different parts of the brain<br>i was really interested in the<br>hippocampus so we can collect the dorsal<br>part of this<br>ventral part of the hippocampus just<br>because it also versus the ventricle<br>camps<br>they have a very different function in<br>terms of spatial<br>learning and memory and we could also<br>dissect different parts of the<br>hippocampus okay ce1<br>ca3 and ca4 and frontal cortex and also<br>the lateral side in interliner pairing<br>or whatever<br>so my i published several papers<br>basically shows<br>there are eight related changes in loss<br>and arginase<br>in multiple brain regions and some<br>changes actually correlate with<br>behavioral<br>performance<br>later on i discovered it's not that<br>simple arginine metabolism<br>because on a thing can be further<br>metabolized to glutamate gaba and<br>glutamine<br>and those two are the main neuron<br>transmitter in the brain<br>one is to stimulate neurons and other<br>one child<br>and on the thing can also be metabolized<br>to form a group<br>of polyamines putrescing sperm ending<br>and sperming<br>polyamines the physiological level of<br>polyamides are extremely important<br>for health so in cancer patient<br>okay polyamine levels extremely high<br>therefore they could you know the cells<br>to grow<br>abnormally becomes a tumor if it's too<br>low can affect the cell growth<br>so how this relates to ad<br>and we know polyamines play a very very<br>important role<br>in terms of you know make all those<br>microtubules<br>assembled and also involved in the<br>amyloid beta aggregation<br>and recently there's research uh<br>suggesting<br>sperm ending is a new longevity drug if<br>you treat aged rest with sperming<br>they you know they are very healthy and<br>they can perform much much better<br>than the control ones and furthermore<br>swimming can block<br>tail aggregation looks like polyamines<br>somehow have a link with ad pathology<br>then i discovered more okay<br>so argentine can be metabolized by<br>another enzyme called arginine<br>decarboxylation from augmentation<br>agreement was really really interesting<br>itself can be can used to be as a<br>precursor to form polyamines<br>and egg venting basically stands at a<br>crossroad of arginine metabolism<br>try to regulate the north pathway and<br>also<br>the polyamine biosynthesis also it's<br>really really interesting<br>and agreement itself and has been<br>considered<br>the putative neurotransmitter and also<br>involved in the knee and memory<br>so from this diagram you can see agamemn<br>basically plays a very very important<br>role<br>in terms of controlling nitric oxide<br>production and also polyamides<br>and interestingly uh adamantine has so<br>many pharmacological effects<br>okay for example eggman takes a<br>neuroprotective<br>anti-inflammation and can enhance<br>learning and memory<br>for a while and edmonton researchers<br>thought<br>agreementing is basically a magic<br>shotgun<br>because it has multiple molecular<br>targets<br>so this diagram just illustrates<br>augmenting biomedical research<br>so edgar maintain was discovered in 1910<br>by the famous professor kusel and who<br>was the nobel prize winner<br>in that year so he found eggman chain<br>in herring sperm this is for the first<br>time okay<br>and we know egmenting so during world<br>war<br>ii um researchers found egmenting can be<br>used to treat<br>diabetes okay that's something<br>interesting<br>it wasn't until 1994 there was a paper<br>published in science<br>by reece and also sander recognizing<br>they demonstrated the presence of<br>agmenting<br>and also it's a biosynthesis enzyme adc<br>in the mammalian brain however the<br>function of the endogenous<br>okay endogenous agmenting in the brain<br>is not clear and later on<br>jade glad published a number of papers<br>showing eggman chain is neuroprotective<br>and he even tried a small clinical trial<br>to show agamentine can be used to treat<br>neuropathic pain<br>i was really really interested in<br>augmenting however<br>i didn't really have a way to measure<br>one day i talked to my husband who<br>i said well i really everything sounds<br>fantastic<br>i want to measure augmenting<br>i have no way how you know because i<br>don't really know any you know analytic<br>method<br>and he thought okay okay i probably can<br>help you okay<br>so he worked in pharmacy and he knows<br>how to do hplc and lcms<br>and he developed hplc and lcms method<br>so now we can measure arginine and its<br>downstream metabolites<br>and which allow me to make look at<br>argentinian metabolic profile<br>changes in milligram tissue and also in<br>biofluid for example blood and cerebral<br>spinal fluid as well<br>so this really opens a big door for me<br>and i know the egmenting is present<br>in the hippocampus and hippocampus is so<br>important for learning and<br>memory so this diagram really shows this<br>is a synapse it<br>really means you know the communication<br>point between the neurons<br>and edmund is present in the president<br>terminal so i thought what's the role of<br>endogenous argument<br>in learning and memory how is there<br>any way i could figure this out<br>so if advantage is involved in learning<br>and memory<br>if you train animals to learn something<br>you would expect admitting levels<br>increased<br>in the brain region involved in learning<br>and memory<br>okay then i designed a study using the<br>water maze<br>so this is a kind of swimming pool with<br>a hidden platform located here<br>then you can put a rest to learn the<br>place of this platform<br>by using the external cues so this is a<br>spatial learning and memory<br>they have to use the cues to figure out<br>where<br>the platform is so i have three<br>groups and the first one what training<br>group you have to learn<br>okay where the platform is and the<br>second one the swimming only<br>just a swing and the third one<br>do nothing sitting in the box right<br>then as usual we collect some samples<br>from different parts of the brain<br>then we quantify the admitting levels<br>so this leads to a rapid publication<br>we found some brain regions show the<br>increased<br>level of segmenting so this is probably<br>easier to view<br>okay the numbers are too hard to see so<br>as you can see there's no difference<br>between the swimmy only group and<br>holding box group<br>which really indicates swimming did<br>nothing for egmenting<br>and it was watermelon's learning spatial<br>learning leads to the increased<br>level of agmenting in the hippocampus<br>ce1<br>dented gyrus and vegetable neurite a<br>so associate professor bill leach<br>in the electron microscopy and we talked<br>about and we collaborated<br>so we could use an antibody to bind to<br>the eggman team<br>and to look at all those black dots<br>really means augmenting okay<br>in the synaptic terminals then quantify<br>those dots<br>and the builder and also the students we<br>co-supervised<br>steve seale and found water mesh<br>training induced increased agreement<br>level<br>in the hippocampus cei synapses which is<br>very interesting further supported role<br>of excellent change in learning and<br>memory<br>so madiha was was the first phd student<br>i supervised with her<br>and she's a very talented student and<br>working hard<br>so we decided to do this in vivo micro<br>diabetes study this is<br>even more challenging and we need to<br>insert a prop and<br>we can collect fluid between the cells<br>in the brain<br>then quantify the levels of eggman team<br>before during and after what makes<br>the spatial learning in this water-based<br>setting<br>okay so basically we can look at the<br>dynamic change of elementary<br>in the brain so what she found<br>so this box really represents the basal<br>level and<br>looks like swimming only didn't do<br>anything however when the rest<br>learning the platform and you can see<br>about six-fold increase in the agmenting<br>in the hippocampus and every time when<br>you train<br>and you can see the augmenting levels<br>going high so really means edmonton does<br>something<br>so we continue to train animals for a<br>couple of days<br>then you can test animals memory to the<br>place<br>to the platform locations so this is a<br>recall trial<br>and you can see the egmenting level<br>increase again<br>so this study really provides the first<br>evidence<br>of endogenous admin team directly<br>participates in the process<br>of learning and memory which is even<br>tested<br>so my group you know we had published a<br>number of papers<br>on the effects of aging on the brain<br>arginine metabolism in red i won't have<br>time to talk about everything just pick<br>up a couple to show you<br>so this study because edmund chain<br>was really really interesting to me at<br>that time i said wow how aging affects<br>eggman chain in the brain<br>so again this is a rapid publication<br>it's really simple<br>we have you know some animals pretty old<br>24 months<br>and some breaths middle age 12 months<br>and the other group<br>the young rats only four months old we<br>clear the brain tissue then we<br>look at compared admitting levels in a<br>different<br>region across all three groups so it<br>looks like<br>aging affects augmenting level<br>dramatically okay<br>and if you look at the pattern some<br>brain regions<br>shows you know age related reduction<br>in admitting other brain regions shows<br>age-related increase<br>so later on another phd student niraj<br>systematically investigated<br>and how the arginine metabolism changes<br>in multiple brain regions<br>and across the three age groups<br>and he found aged reds you know<br>performed poorly<br>in the water maze task this is the path<br>length<br>means age rates generate a longer<br>distance to find a platform<br>poor performance so those aged rats<br>also couldn't remember exactly the<br>platform<br>was therefore had reduced the number of<br>platform clothing<br>during the memory test and interestingly<br>niraj found some changes of course is<br>region specific<br>you know not every region shows changes<br>the increased noise activity i just want<br>to highlight<br>prefrontal cortex which is a pfc here<br>and also por here<br>then lots of numbers because we looked<br>at<br>arginine and the downstream metabolites<br>and across all those eight<br>regions lots of numbers so those areas<br>basically increase you know indicates a<br>high level in the aged rest<br>otherwise reduce the blue one the green<br>one<br>so the only thing quite interesting you<br>can see all the change is consistent<br>okay across all the brain regions and<br>egg maintain<br>and some regions shows reduced agmenting<br>for example in the prefrontal cortex the<br>other one shows redu<br>and maintain the por so it took me a<br>while to figure out what all those<br>things<br>and the simple way i want to look at how<br>agmenting<br>relates to the north because egmentine<br>can regulate<br>north so from this diagram looks like in<br>a lower<br>because it's a negative correlation<br>looks like a lower level of augmentation<br>okay and have higher level of noise<br>and for por raging this is the<br>positive correlation looks like high<br>agmenting level and high noise activity<br>so the explanation uh was the high level<br>of elementaing<br>and maybe a campaign mechanism<br>to control age-related elevation in<br>north activity<br>if their region augmenting levels pretty<br>low<br>probably cannot do this task<br>so then my research<br>moved to the alzheimer's disease and<br>which was supported by<br>two hrc programs so the first<br>one is a cognitive decline during aging<br>and enzymes<br>and we are focused on biomarkers and<br>therapeutic targets<br>and the second one we're just about to<br>finish by the end of the year<br>so as you can see there are a number of<br>researchers involved<br>in this program and the first one<br>we have professor robert knight from<br>psychology<br>and nick carfield and professor cliff<br>abraham<br>and the second one involves cliff<br>warren tate from biochemistry and also<br>associate professor joanna williams<br>and stephanie hugh we have been<br>working together for 10 years<br>so my work in a.d field and basically we<br>try to do multiple things um<br>post-mortem human brain tissue will tell<br>us what's going on you know what kind of<br>changes of argentine metabolism<br>in the human brains because of the real<br>diseased conditions<br>okay and we also have<br>blood and also csf samples from the<br>human patient<br>and we can work on the biomarker side<br>so animal model is really good because<br>those models allows you to<br>look at each individual aspect okay try<br>to understand<br>the mechanism side as you can see from<br>this slide we have all kinds of models<br>we can<br>do the brain injection of those<br>toxic peptides and we also have a<br>transgenic<br>mouse model to target amyloid beta<br>tau protein or enos<br>so another branch of my work<br>is to explore the therapeutic potential<br>of egmenting<br>so all those students um contribute to<br>the publications uh we basically<br>looked at all those aspects okay<br>so i am going to show you<br>the human tissue work which is the<br>collaboration<br>with a professor richard force group in<br>auckland<br>and along with maurice henry and<br>jocelyn so this is the team from otago<br>university so this is the first study<br>to look at all three metabolic pathways<br>okay<br>and to look at how arginine metabolism<br>changes in alzheimer's disease<br>so the samples the regions we selected<br>was a superior frontal gyrus and<br>hippocampus and<br>cerebellum so at that time we use the<br>cerebellum as a control region because<br>cerebellum is very special<br>for whatever reason cerebellum doesn't<br>have<br>tangles you can see the plaques but no<br>tangles at<br>all and superior frontal gelatin and<br>hippocampus of course are affected<br>severely in alzheimer's disease<br>and we have three groups we have a<br>normal case<br>at age 860 and a normal case<br>at mean age 80. so there's a 20 years<br>difference<br>so we can see age-related changes in<br>arginine metabolism<br>and we also have a third group which is<br>alzheimer's disease group<br>the mean age 80. then we can compare<br>those two<br>to find out if there's any alzheimer's<br>disease related<br>changes<br>so mike fleet was the fourth year<br>honor student at that time so all the<br>north and ardenna's enzyme<br>essay and western blotting work was done<br>by<br>a mic fleet so in general we found<br>reduced loss okay and increase the<br>arginase<br>but if you look at all those the bar<br>graph<br>closely you can see aed and age-related<br>disease<br>so just to remind you that the black bar<br>means a d group<br>and the h bar in the middle nc80<br>and the open bar nc60<br>for example here you know the<br>hippocampus and the north activity is<br>extremely low<br>and nc80 is low and nc860 groups here<br>so age and also ad-related<br>decrease i am very very interested in<br>this result because it really shows<br>eonos deficiency in the alzheimer's<br>disease patient as you can see the enos<br>in the superior frontal gyrus and<br>hippocampus the protein level is<br>extremely low<br>and the e-loss-derived nitric oxide is<br>so<br>important in maintaining normal cell<br>blood flow<br>okay this is very interesting<br>so in terms of arginase and we found a<br>d-related<br>increase because there's no difference<br>between<br>nc 60 and nc 80<br>with only increase in the ad group<br>relative to<br>so we found reduced noise but<br>l-citrulline is the product of this<br>enzyme<br>showing no change we found increased<br>arteries activity<br>or protein however the product l<br>on a thing was reduced very specifically<br>in ad<br>cases okay and regarding eggman team we<br>found<br>age-related decrease<br>in and for putressing<br>ad or age related<br>so i try to put something together and<br>find meaning of this<br>and when i put something like this the<br>noise is down<br>and no change in l-citrulline alternates<br>up and reduced on the thing okay<br>took me a while to figure out what that<br>all those numbers means<br>and eventually i discovered another<br>pathway<br>which involves ornithine<br>trans-carbomonase<br>this is the key enzyme involved in<br>the urea cycle so the urea cycle<br>is the important very important cycle<br>present<br>in the liver a mean to remove this<br>toxic ammonia through this pathway<br>to produce a non-toxic urea this is a<br>very important pathway<br>however in the ad brain ammonia level is<br>very very high<br>therefore it is possible under the<br>condition of ad<br>because ammonia level is quite high<br>so this pathway is somehow induced as a<br>protective mechanism<br>okay so my phd student jody<br>has been working on the urea cycle and<br>he has some<br>evidence suggesting otcs indeed induced<br>okay in the alzheimer's disease brain<br>so there are a number of questions for<br>me to answer<br>and first one whether all those arginine<br>metabolic profile changes<br>and urea cycle induction are very<br>specific to ad<br>if not whether all those changes could<br>be a marker of neurodegeneration<br>so as i mentioned earlier the animal<br>model<br>provides a very good tool for us to<br>tease out<br>each part okay of the pathological<br>changes in the ad brain so the phd<br>student pronoun<br>and worked on the ps19 tail mice<br>and which is mainly focused on the tau<br>protein okay<br>and he found altered arginine metabolism<br>and this is a collaboration with<br>professor daniel lee in states and he<br>also worked on<br>apps one mice and this mines to model<br>amyloid<br>better side okay<br>and phd student actually and worked on<br>enos deficient mice because we could see<br>dramatic reduction enos protein ad brain<br>so they found out brain adenine<br>metabolism<br>however in a different way so today i<br>want to have time to explain the data<br>but<br>anyways lots of changes okay in all<br>i'm really really interested in enos<br>side because enos derived<br>no is so important for cerebral blood<br>flow<br>so i thought we probably could make a<br>new model all right<br>so epps one present amyloid beta<br>pathology<br>so how about if we add a cerebral<br>vascular component to this model<br>by crossing app ps1 mice with enos<br>knockout mice so this is work<br>um phd student sarah made and hannah<br>also contributed<br>during her honors year so this is the<br>example of<br>amyloid plaques in the brain okay as you<br>can see this is app ps1<br>mice looks like this and this is a<br>triple one ap<br>ps1 enos partial more calciumized<br>definitely<br>and more plaques in the brain which is<br>quite interesting<br>and interestingly this new model<br>had more severe memory deficit when we<br>tested<br>okay animals in the morris water maze so<br>this<br>makes this is a very interesting model<br>because<br>now funding is really tight you don't<br>really want to keep<br>those animals until 12 months of age<br>then use it so those animals show quite<br>severe<br>a better load increase and also<br>so we are also interested in the<br>biomarker side this is a phd student<br>david bergen's work and he reported<br>after the plasma arginine metabolism<br>precedes the behavioral and brain<br>arginine<br>metabolic profile change in the apps one<br>mice<br>so he used this app as one mice<br>and tested two age groups one the<br>younger group<br>at seven months the other one at seven<br>and thirteen months<br>so for the younger group you could only<br>see very scattered amyloid plaques in<br>the brain<br>okay and for those animals at 13 months<br>old you could see lots of flux in the<br>brain<br>and the older one also shows the<br>behavioral impairment as well<br>so they found a lot of some you know<br>neurochemical changes<br>in the brain in the 13 months old but<br>only very very mild change in the seven<br>but interestingly she he also looked at<br>plasma profile and he found a lot of<br>changes<br>in plasma in the younger group<br>for example the pure testing and the<br>sperming and those ones are the<br>polyamines<br>when we did this very special analysis<br>rock analysis<br>and plasma putrescing and swimming<br>basically were able to separate apps one<br>mice from the control<br>okay which is something quite<br>interesting<br>i would like to further explore the<br>potential<br>um you know the biomarker side using<br>um the arginine metabolism so<br>at alzheimer's conference i met<br>dr albert and also um gerard<br>at a conference so they were from spain<br>we basically looked at the same poster<br>and talked to each other and said oh you<br>are interested in biomarkers<br>yes yes what did you do okay it turns<br>out they<br>they are very very interested in my<br>argentine metabolism work and provide<br>the samples<br>both plasma and csf samples from the<br>same subject<br>and this time we looked at alzheimer's<br>so we found a number of arginine<br>metabolized<br>level changes in the plasma and csf<br>just give you in one example we haven't<br>published the results yet<br>so you can see this arginine metabolic<br>metabolite one the levels reduced in the<br>plasma and also csf<br>basically shows a parallel reduction<br>which is quite interesting<br>then we found that the lower level of<br>this<br>arginine metabolize and correlate with<br>high level of<br>tail either total tail or phosphorylated<br>cell<br>tells not good okay and more<br>interestingly<br>when we they provide cognitive function<br>test<br>results which is mmse many mental state<br>examination results<br>the lower level of this particular<br>arginine metabolize correlates with the<br>poor performance<br>okay poor function of cognitive<br>so i would like to further explore<br>the potential of argentine metabolism as<br>a market for a.d<br>and looking for more funding to support<br>this line of work<br>egg maintain is my favorite<br>and um but sadly this<br>field is quite small not many people<br>working in the in this field and many<br>years ago i remember when i presented my<br>work at a conference<br>many people look at me edmonton what is<br>the admin thing i've<br>never heard of augmentee no idea what<br>you are talking about<br>okay so collectively i think this is a<br>group of 16<br>researchers around the world and we<br>decided to write a review article<br>the title's augmenting clinical<br>applications after 100 years in<br>translation<br>my phd student made her she's really<br>interested in<br>eggman team and she carried out a study<br>to look at anti-aging effects<br>of egg maintain she had three groups<br>the young group young animals treated<br>with saline<br>aged rats treated with saline and also<br>aged the rats treated with<br>eggman chain she tasted animals<br>in the object recognition task okay so<br>first of all<br>she just put animal in the box and get<br>animals too familiar with<br>all those objects and one day<br>she put a normal object to replace<br>one of those familiar ones and you could<br>see<br>aged red with saline treatment performed<br>poorly relative to control<br>however aged breath with augmenting<br>treatment perform<br>then she did another test simply all<br>those familiar objects and she<br>simply swapped the position and<br>displaced object<br>so again you could see eight direct<br>treatment saline performed poorly<br>relative to the<br>young one but augmenting treated ones<br>performed<br>much much better as good as the young<br>one<br>she also looked at some neurochemical<br>changes in the brain<br>and this time and you could see the age<br>of the rats<br>with saline treatment had higher level<br>of<br>norse activity and agavementine<br>treatment basically can<br>normalize this kind of age-related<br>changes<br>in north activity and interestingly<br>the enos protein is reduced in age to<br>brain<br>however augmenting treatment can restore<br>the enos protein back to the normal<br>level<br>so this is very interesting<br>so david bergen looked at another model<br>and this time he used this<br>toxic amyloid beta peptide 25 to 35<br>and this 11 peptide and basically is the<br>core part of the<br>the following of amyloid beta so<br>he infused both into the brain<br>and also test it in the behavioral test<br>so this is a radioamaze<br>task so a better the toxic peptide group<br>with saline treatment<br>made more errors in this task however<br>argumenting treated one can reduce<br>the errors and perform as good as the<br>control<br>so this is the same task novel and<br>displaced object<br>and you can see the agmenting treatment<br>can<br>protect against amyloid-induced memory<br>impairment in the red<br>so sarah ahmed still working on her phd<br>tried to look at therapeutic potential<br>of elementing for aed<br>the project is still ongoing<br>so eggman chain i think this edmonton<br>research<br>has gained you know great interest um<br>over the last couple of years so this is<br>a very important paper published in the<br>very high impact factor journal cell<br>indicates augmenting has a role in<br>longevity<br>so you know metaforming is a drug to<br>treat<br>diabetes and metformin has a longevity<br>effect<br>so this study basically shows uh<br>augmenting<br>mediates the longevity effect of<br>metaforming because when you take<br>metformin<br>metaforming can stimulate the gut<br>bacteria<br>to produce augmenting their agmenting<br>can<br>increase lipid metabolism therefore<br>to increase the lifespan this is a very<br>interesting study<br>so we have a project ongoing to look at<br>the role of agmenting in maintaining<br>healthy<br>brain aging with the support of brain<br>health research center because<br>the rats are very very expensive and<br>jet glad kindly gifted 2kg<br>eggman team to support our work<br>so we basically treat animals from<br>middle age for nine or ten months<br>then tested you know how those aged<br>animals behave in the tasks and also<br>threadable blood flow<br>and and other factors as well so i have<br>two honest students working on a project<br>to<br>okay i have talked about alzheimer's<br>disease<br>um so ad is basically the<br>the main form and the big umbrella of<br>dementia<br>at this stage we have no cure for our<br>type of disease<br>what could we do stop alzheimer's<br>probably before it starts<br>so now um aed researchers<br>have waved a big flag okay encourage<br>people to<br>do whatever you can to promote<br>successful aging<br>have healthy you know lifestyle and<br>exercise<br>regularly all right do whatever you can<br>okay we have a very nice group you know<br>dancing<br>um friends and we meet every week and<br>sometimes<br>we perform okay and my favorite<br>vegetable garden i worked a lot in my<br>vegetable garden i<br>worked a lot try to exercise i set up a<br>limit<br>for myself i need to work 10 000 steps<br>every day so this is a my goal<br>uh successful aging i hope this is also<br>your goal<br>okay we do need to age successfully<br>that's the end of my talk thank you very<br>much<br>my name is lisa madison-smith and i am<br>the head of department<br>of anatomy and it is my pleasure<br>to be able to speak<br>at these ipls and to celebrate<br>the truly impressive<br>career and research career of<br>of our colleagues so as a head of<br>department you you talk with people when<br>they're applying<br>for their promotion so you get to see<br>the amazing<br>cvs because you we know our colleagues<br>but we don't know our colleagues that<br>well<br>uh in a large department but when you<br>sit down with somebody who's applying<br>for promotion<br>you really get a chance to look at look<br>at their cv and<br>it is it is truly an honor uh and<br>as always but certainly in the case of<br>ping as well<br>but at the ipl at the lectures you get<br>to see another side<br>um to our colleagues and you you can see<br>how they<br>got to where they are and you start to<br>see um<br>patterns i guess in uh in their<br>behaviors in the way that they do things<br>and again i think we we've seen this uh<br>with ping and we<br>see certain patterns like her dedication<br>to family her commitment and the support<br>that she has and that she gives to her<br>family and similarly<br>to her students we see these patterns<br>have extended collaborations<br>extended over time and extended across<br>the globe<br>and and certainly that's been<br>been demonstrated in in ping's ipl<br>tonight i also often say watching these<br>these these ipls you there's something<br>in it for everybody and you always kind<br>of see something that really<br>connects to you and sadly in ping's case<br>so the thing that really got me was yep<br>learn slowly<br>forget easily that's me i get up here<br>and i completely forget everything that<br>i was going to say<br>but i do remember um talking with<br>ping i think it must have been just<br>after lockdown perhaps<br>just before but she was so so excited to<br>she said to me lisa i've got this<br>i've got this huge amount two kilos of<br>agmatine i'm so excited<br>and i kind of smiled and went nodded<br>and uh and said you know it was clear<br>that this was<br>this was quite uh quite a a score<br>um so after tonight's uh<br>lecture i have to say that now it's my<br>favorite too and i got to get some of<br>that that magic<br>of agmatine and try to deal with my<br>hippocampal<br>issues so um i thank you<br>certainly for for uh educating me<br>on this this important research uh and<br>and all seriousness uh thank you for the<br>work that you've done<br>um addressing these very serious<br>issues that so many new zealanders are<br>facing so please<br>um join me in thanking<br>ping for this wonderful ipl and<br>i also get to present you with a a small<br>memento and<br>and congratulations in recognition of<br>this wonderful<br>you're a my name is paul brunson and i'm<br>the pvc for health sciences<br>and i have two duties tonight the first<br>duties to thank you our audience<br>for coming to this uh very enjoyable i'm<br>sure you'll all agree<br>in oral professorial lecture so firstly<br>thank you for coming<br>and secondly my final duty is to invite<br>you to come and join us for refreshments<br>to continue to celebrate uh ping lou's<br>success<br>and join us in fellowship over some<br>refreshments before we do that i think<br>we should thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
