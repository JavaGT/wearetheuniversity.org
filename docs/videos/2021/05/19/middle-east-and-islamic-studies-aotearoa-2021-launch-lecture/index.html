and otago who are<br>all studying middle east politics<br>now so this is the new the next<br>generation of scholars and<br>observers and uh interlocutors without<br>the<br>middle east and the islamic world so<br>we're very grateful to have them joining<br>us and all the other guests who are<br>joining us online as well<br>thank you and welcome so without any<br>further ado i want to pass over to dr<br>nadine krautmayer who's going to tell<br>you what is<br>um now okay so<br>the the seats for this network uh date<br>back quite some time but<br>uh the current form now um<br>started just before the the lockdown<br>last year<br>that we got together and thought it's<br>time to to start and make an effort to<br>establish such a network<br>and i think international events be it<br>uh refugees coming to new zealand be it<br>the<br>the christchurch attacks that happen all<br>demonstrated it's very important to<br>to look at what's going on not only in<br>the middle east and north africa<br>but also in other countries where you<br>have muslim minorities or majorities<br>as well as here in new zealand and<br>i think new zealand has a very unique<br>position here that we have<br>communities from so many different<br>cultural backgrounds from so many<br>different countries<br>social political economic context and we<br>try to<br>somehow make that visible also in the<br>name of this network and<br>i think the first meetings we had were<br>all about<br>how do we call us how do we make it<br>possible to include<br>all those diverse perspectives<br>regions and communities<br>so that's how we came up with this name<br>to make sure we cover the core middle<br>eastern countries<br>look at authoritarianism in those<br>countries as economic development<br>at religious minorities thereby it<br>christian<br>or uh other sects<br>and um to link those two to our<br>perspective here<br>um so in the past year we<br>we have organized a couple of um of<br>events<br>to first of all see how many<br>who is out there in new zealand and we<br>were very positively surprised that<br>we thought we are a small community of a<br>few people but actually<br>we very quickly for our first big<br>meeting<br>already had 30 members who were very<br>interested in joining both<br>senior scholars but also ma students phd<br>students who felt that<br>they have now a platform that they can<br>con<br>on which they can connect to other<br>students but also that can reach out to<br>to civil society to think tanks and<br>provide maybe<br>an entry point at some point for for<br>their careers and<br>different jobs so some examples of the<br>meetings we had last year were<br>a talk on the constitutional<br>transformation of turkey which is<br>a very important development i think<br>everyone has heard of<br>what's going on in turkey in the past<br>years but we also had<br>other topics be it the tribal state<br>relations in yemen and the current<br>situation in yemen<br>or civil military relations in pakistan<br>but also the<br>development of a muslim identity here in<br>new zealand so we always try to<br>to build up this this bridge to<br>to topics that are relevant in this<br>context and the perspective of<br>new zealand scholars if we look now at<br>our<br>members then we can see that all<br>universities in new zealand are somehow<br>represented in this network so otago was<br>kind enough to host us but all our<br>members represent different universities<br>in terms of future plans we want to<br>engage obviously and more academic<br>events<br>but this launch um also functions<br>as an occasion to to reach out to<br>um to other actors and organizations out<br>there be it civil society<br>be it government representatives policy<br>circles etc so i hope we can<br>have a fruitful discussion and<br>presentations tonight<br>and and take further steps from here<br>thank you very much<br>right so i welcome to the lector<br>ibrahim welcome thank you so much for<br>being with us tonight<br>and that is forgetting is the plague of<br>knowledge in the contemporary times we<br>live in<br>where the synonym of islam in the middle<br>islam in the middle east is a terrorism<br>we have allowed ourselves to forget<br>the history of the large and the most<br>important region<br>we have forgotten them as islam and the<br>middle east<br>dates back to the downs of civilization<br>and has produced the scholars<br>scientists storytellers activists<br>historians<br>the list goes on who shifted the nature<br>of our world<br>today we know where the gap of the node<br>we know where this gap of<br>knowledge in this region had directed us<br>the plague of islamophobia as a result<br>of<br>course through the veins of academic<br>institutions<br>the foreign policy of international<br>i stand here today as a member of<br>parliament to share my reflections on<br>the importance of this launch tonight<br>the inauguration of the middle east and<br>islamic studies at eroa<br>known as mesa network marks a commitment<br>to understanding<br>engaging and producing critical thoughts<br>into this region<br>which is long overdue to aterwa or for<br>iteroa<br>due to the small size and geographical<br>in<br>isolation of new zealand we have held an<br>incredibly fortunate position<br>in the international realm we know this<br>because international dilemmas often<br>fall at four at doorsteps of our<br>neighbors<br>or our friends while we benefited with<br>the time to observe<br>the plan and the option the option to<br>act<br>when required however as the world is<br>growing and<br>becoming increasingly interconnected<br>the physical distance we hold is no<br>longer advantage<br>we perceive it to be we perceive it to<br>be<br>with the globalization driving the<br>connecting<br>force of transport movement of people<br>um internet and the influx of<br>information and ideologies<br>we are closing the distance when we are<br>not<br>exempt from the global issues and traits<br>that we have been watching<br>or happening overseas which we<br>unfortunately have highlighted through<br>which have been highlighted through the<br>pandemic and<br>the christchurch massacre<br>i remember moving to new zealand as a<br>muslim and refugee my main priority and<br>ambition was to study<br>education was a golden ticket for me and<br>the way out of my 80 hours a week work<br>when i started my first paper of<br>international relations<br>and the political science particularly<br>and i was interested in studying about<br>the middle east and islamic world<br>as someone who migrated from north east<br>africa<br>i was very close which is very close to<br>middle east not just geographically but<br>also culturally and linguistically<br>i wanted to learn more about the region<br>that heavily impacted my country<br>and also myself why who made me who i am<br>today<br>the fact that i am a muslim and that i<br>speak arabic are not mere coincidence<br>if we take back if we look back to the<br>expansion of the ottoman empire in 1557<br>to the now known eritrea and ethiopia or<br>the habesha<br>which encompassed eritrea at the time as<br>well<br>we begin to we begin to try the<br>transfusion of culture<br>religion and the language the historical<br>buzz based historical pathway of linking<br>these two regions<br>unraveled the fabric of the culture that<br>i<br>participate in today to give you an idea<br>the 50 percent of the european<br>population<br>adheres to islam and and about the same<br>percentage also speaks<br>um arabic while arabic is one of the<br>eritrea<br>so when i started my first lecture and<br>the topic of islam was<br>discussed at some point and i was<br>surprised to about how little my fellow<br>students knew about the islamic middle<br>east<br>they were quick to link it with the flow<br>of refugees at the time<br>there was a biggest refugee crisis and<br>also terrorism<br>somehow also misurging<br>that's also because of the<br>misrepresentation of the region in the<br>media<br>the misrepresentation of the regime and<br>islam in the media<br>and also the mainstream politics we have<br>seen in the last four or five years how<br>the the ban from muslim countries and<br>calling<br>um the countries and regionist names had<br>basically fueled the hatred and<br>and also the preacher does against<br>muslims and also<br>um it was always a surprise<br>when i um introjected about how much<br>islam<br>had the mid how might islam and the<br>middle east contributed to the human<br>civilization<br>and and a lot of people seem to be<br>surprised always because<br>islam is always that primitive religion<br>a place where people basically known as<br>savages come from and as a politician<br>now i'm still<br>also surprised at how my my fellow<br>politicians and other<br>decision makers know about islam and the<br>middle east<br>that means we have a long way to go<br>islam in the middle east have been a<br>global focus in the last few years<br>because of massive oil reserve that's<br>been booming for the last five decades<br>successful uh gulf wars started in 1990<br>um the invasion of the iraqi invasion of<br>kuwait<br>extremism and terrorism specifically<br>since september 11.<br>the arab spring somehow also gave the<br>region a focus<br>the ongoing syrian and yemeni conflicts<br>of course the longest conflict in the<br>region which is israeli and the policy<br>and<br>palestinian conflict means the focal<br>will remain<br>more or less what happens on both<br>islamic world and the middle east<br>in 1973 um the oil crisis<br>could be a good example how new zealand<br>new zealand has sent its trophies<br>serving afghanistan iraq and the sinai<br>the parts of<br>the part of peacekeeping missions<br>between israel and egypt at the time<br>in early 80s the muslim community here<br>in new zealand is also<br>vibrant and it's growing the muslim<br>community<br>members also have maintained a strong<br>relationship with the country of origins<br>we can talk about fred the halal trade<br>itself<br>was about 3.5 billion and it's growing<br>every day<br>the trade exchange is is also on the<br>rise<br>and expo 2020 is an opportunity for new<br>zealand to showcase its values<br>innovation and and the creativity but<br>most<br>importantly to connect itself to the<br>islamic and the mission middle eastern<br>wallet<br>this is the world's largest gathering of<br>commerce culture and<br>industry will also be an opportunity for<br>audience<br>it is important that our future<br>generation have access to an institution<br>and network<br>such as this middle east and islamic<br>studies<br>at irwin network it<br>is because it's a region it's<br>strategically located it's also<br>natural land bridge connecting the<br>continents of<br>east asia africa and europe<br>and recent times its innermost deposits<br>of oil have made the middle east more<br>important than ever<br>it brought was negative and positive<br>attention to the region<br>it was also the site of some of the some<br>of the world's<br>earliest civilizations and the various<br>place of three<br>largest um religions of judaism<br>christianity and islam<br>it's the fact that that cannot be<br>ignored<br>as long as it is a long overdue there<br>and<br>it's a long overdue and incredibly<br>irrelevant<br>for our academic institution is to<br>invest in islam in the middle east<br>especially after what happened in march<br>15.<br>through the great leadership of our<br>prime minister and our nation's response<br>to the tragedies we have earned<br>a strong spotlight in international<br>arena today<br>i cannot think of a better time to<br>launch<br>mesa<br>and finally i just wanted to<br>congratulate the organizers and the<br>hard work that you have put into this um<br>i know that it might be the smallest it<br>might seem a small step today but<br>this will have a positive impact<br>in the future when i was a student i was<br>i<br>actively looked around for to find<br>anything<br>that um that linked me back to the<br>region<br>um anything to study but there was<br>always nothing at all<br>so i just want to congratulate you for<br>taking this step because i know<br>uh this is this is a very important to<br>all of us to new zealand<br>which is actively opening up to the<br>islamic world and also<br>the middle east at the moment we've got<br>about nine<br>ambassadors from muslim in the middle<br>eastern countries<br>uh serving in wellington and who are<br>actively looking for opportunities to<br>lincoln israel into their countries of<br>respect i wish some of them would have<br>been invited tonight it would have been<br>good because they are<br>just looking for any opportunity to<br>really um<br>to link their countries to new zealand<br>so<br>lastly and i just wanted to reiterate my<br>congratulations to you and and<br>i'm more than happy to be involved um<br>um as we go forward in this very very<br>for those very insightful and salient<br>points thank you very much<br>so it's my great pleasure to next i just<br>want to note also that<br>the hour of iftar has passed so um<br>anyone wants to<br>so let's move on to our next speaker<br>professor emeritus william harris<br>welcome<br>thanks<br>what i want to i want to start off by<br>following on from ibrahim and<br>congratulating and thanking leon<br>uh and all the rest of you have been<br>involved<br>uh in this this initiative initiative<br>uh leon in particular has been really<br>busy with house renovation and the<br>creation of new courses<br>uh and that he's been able to<br>create such such an enthusiastic<br>uh core for this new venture<br>uh is really fantastic thank you leon<br>uh and again thank you to everybody else<br>uh who's been involved in this and<br>especially<br>uh our academic colleagues from up and<br>down the country we hope we can add<br>civil society people to them<br>uh and the and those from the official<br>and parliamentary arena who<br>join with us in holding<br>these interactions of us all uh<br>can be extremely fruitful in this mixing<br>of perspectives from<br>different origin points uh so this is a<br>great initiative<br>uh i was asked to say something in this<br>talk this little talk<br>uh about the intersection of of new<br>zealand with middle east studies which<br>gave me all sorts of possibilities to<br>head off on<br>uh what i'm going to do is to touch on<br>some aspects of the importance<br>of the middle east to this country<br>and i think there are several aspects<br>involved here there are tangibles such<br>as the commercial<br>and security dimensions there are<br>intangibles<br>uh the fact that our sense of<br>being as a national entity to some<br>extent<br>derives from what happened in gallipoli<br>uh<br>and our other involvements in the in the<br>world wars<br>uh in in the middle east uh that's an<br>intangible<br>uh and then another aspect of the<br>importance of the region to us<br>uh is the flow over<br>from what we do in the region<br>how we approach the region to our other<br>global partnerships and relationships<br>obviously here one's thinking to some<br>degree of the united states uh<br>and then i just wanted to go on and make<br>a few comments about<br>uh difficult increasing tightening and<br>difficulties in terms of doing research<br>significance of the region there is a<br>mild tendency from time to time<br>to downplay the economic and strategic<br>significance of the middle east<br>as a great and vulnerable hub of world<br>commerce<br>and this i think to some extent reflects<br>the united states<br>idea of pivoting away from the middle<br>but along came for example the<br>big ship ever given the big container<br>which demonstrated to us what<br>how easily there can be a global supply<br>chain<br>interruption in the middle east<br>which cause quickly causes billions of<br>dollars in costs<br>and this is just one ship stuck in the<br>this highlights our own commune our own<br>commercial interests in the persian gulf<br>the persian gulf states have become<br>vigorous consumers of food<br>technology services armaments<br>and we are deeply concerned with the<br>security of<br>the security of connection of the<br>persian gulf with the wider worlds<br>because of our own<br>uh interests our own commercial<br>uh we are concerned of the with the<br>security of local wealth the security of<br>thousands of new zealand expatriates and<br>several of these countries<br>the geopolitical stability of the<br>regimes that we<br>ourselves have become to a degree and<br>the human rights behavior of those<br>regimes<br>and most recently of course the<br>differential impact across the region of<br>the pandemic<br>so that's one collection of commercial<br>and<br>security affairs that<br>uh sit heavily with our uh<br>then one of the new relatively new<br>things i mean the involvement of<br>the the clashing of regional powers in<br>the middle east and the involvement of<br>great powers is nothing new of course<br>but we've reached<br>uh in our own days these days a<br>particular level of intensity<br>uh with affairs like the syrian war the<br>yemeni<br>war the libyan the libyan war<br>the involvement of a whole range of<br>external actors<br>in those affairs<br>both the regional and great powers<br>involved in the middle east manipulate<br>arrays of local clients and proxies<br>and they also threaten from time to time<br>to collide directly<br>we've even had almost a collision<br>between<br>turkey and russia uh over the state of<br>affairs in north<br>west uh syria about a year or so ago if<br>you remember the turks were heavily<br>pressed by<br>russian encouragement of the syrian<br>regime to push further into that<br>area and turkey responded very<br>vigorously to that so that's one example<br>then we have israel<br>and iran the conflict between israel and<br>iran on the syrian<br>in the syrian arena<br>we have to be interested in these things<br>because these things can flow on<br>if there are confrontations between and<br>among regional powers and great powers<br>terrorist affairs i suppose you might<br>say<br>islamic state and that sort of thing<br>i think the point needs to be made that<br>a collision of regional powers if it<br>does take place<br>on a higher level than what we've seen<br>in syria recently<br>and it could uh would make would make us<br>the affairs of islamic state and so<br>forth rather small firecrackers by<br>so expertise on and studies of all these<br>fissures are plainly within new<br>zealand's national interests because<br>they<br>affect our affairs across that region<br>and our affairs are<br>not small new zealand also in the<br>intangible area<br>has had an intermittent impetus to do<br>mediation<br>on scandinavian style and this is very a<br>very good thing<br>uh it arises out of our view of the<br>united nations<br>as a platform and last resort for<br>smaller members of the<br>international community<br>and we feel it's worthwhile to offer<br>ourselves from time to time<br>in the possible seat of mediator<br>we're not the only ones of course and<br>the norwegians and swedes have<br>a much bigger institutional apparatus to<br>support it<br>so that's just a few comments on the<br>significance of the region for us i<br>haven't gone into<br>our own formation of national identity<br>and that sort of thing that also arises<br>out of<br>our involvement to some degree out of<br>our involvement in that part of the<br>world<br>particularly i just leave that as a note<br>hanging in mid-air just at the moment<br>now what i wanted to do in the second<br>half and i<br>hope i'm not over overplaying my<br>time here is just to make a few comments<br>about the increasing<br>tightening of possibilities for doing<br>work in the middle east these days<br>there's always been distance and cost<br>for new zealand academics and other new<br>zealanders<br>who want to get involved in the affairs<br>of the region and comment on them<br>there are there are those big factors<br>and those factors of distance and cost<br>means and i know from myself<br>this the effect of this um<br>that one one goes to the middle east<br>one has a list of things to do one<br>really wants to rush into them as fast<br>as possible<br>because you know your costs are good<br>costs are such that things are going to<br>run out for you not too far down the<br>track<br>uh i lived in lebanon for a large part<br>of the 1980s<br>and and felt this there<br>there are some other things i just want<br>to mention though that<br>make things perhaps more difficult as<br>time goes by<br>for doing middle east studies and that<br>makes our association<br>across the country across different<br>spheres in the<br>country academics civil society official<br>parliamentary<br>uh makes our cooperation very very<br>important the limited resources<br>and the costs of involvement in that<br>part of the world and the academic<br>academic and and and writing areas<br>uh firstly there's been a contraction<br>of the traditional media of record<br>in the arab world and in turkey<br>particularly<br>newspapers of considerable repute like<br>in the arab world safir<br>a leftist newspaper in lebanon radical<br>a leftist newspaper in turkey these are<br>all<br>publications that are no longer with us<br>because of the pressures they've been<br>under in the political arena<br>with journalists being carted off to<br>jails and<br>publications wrecked by sudden finding<br>of tax revenues that they ought to<br>produce by<br>the the journalists have migrated in<br>different directions<br>and they've migrated into worthwhile new<br>but these new publications are more<br>and they're more distant from the<br>sources of information<br>then there's more effect of surveillance<br>and restriction by the regional and<br>great powers that have such a stake in<br>syria for example<br>these days regional powers have a<br>command of the arena now that they<br>didn't have in 19<br>in 2015 2016. this is from about 2017<br>onwards as turkey for example<br>has reinforced its role as the<br>gatekeeper of access<br>and that's a risk that's to some degree<br>a restrictive<br>the regional powers for don't<br>particularly want western academics<br>wandering around and<br>and then of course on top of anything<br>else there's the pandemic the pandemic<br>has come along to freeze us<br>all together on top of the difficulties<br>of<br>access the new difficulties with<br>contracting media outlets<br>as documentary sources<br>just to finish these comments i'd like<br>to<br>make a plug in favor of the teaching of<br>arabic in new zealand<br>arabic is the only one of<br>the six official languages of the united<br>nations that is not taught<br>in any tertiary education as far as i<br>know<br>uh institution in this in this country<br>it is a language spoken by<br>in terms of justification<br>if you did a calculation where you<br>weighed up what the money that people<br>make out of the middle east the private<br>and state<br>sources make out of the house of the<br>middle east<br>in this country and the cost of having<br>one small<br>centre or something with a couple with<br>two or three staff members<br>to provide a seat for arabic as one of<br>the six official languages of the united<br>nations<br>uh the car the cost differential<br>is huge i mean the the<br>revenues that people derive from the<br>middle east<br>uh in one way or another<br>and the and the cost of setting up<br>something for the study of arabic<br>and it's not just arabic the three<br>mai the three languages of the non-arab<br>states<br>uh obviously farsi turkish and hebrew<br>uh are spoken all together by something<br>not far short of 200 million people<br>to add to the 450 odd million people who<br>speak arabic<br>so i just take take my chance here to<br>so to sum up we have security interests<br>in the middle east we have economic<br>interests that are affected by<br>security problems uh<br>we have human rights in in interests and<br>we have the interests that arise from<br>our own history of interaction<br>uh from gallipoli onwards<br>in the middle east each of these arenas<br>and good knowledge and a decent<br>expertise base<br>which this initiative is designed<br>to further help us to secure<br>a whole array of interests that we have<br>in that part of the world<br>so thank you thank you very much for<br>meanderings<br>thank you bill um not meanderings at all<br>i mean is incredibly concise and very uh<br>to the point thank you very much<br>and one of the shortest talks we've<br>heard so thank you<br>mr tony lynch um welcome thank you very<br>much<br>my thanks to leon goldsmith for this<br>opportunity to speak to you today<br>and as an otago alumnus i'm of course<br>shamelessly biased to anything that<br>involves the university but i i'd like<br>to join<br>others in expressing my congratulations<br>for the launch<br>of the mesa network today<br>and to all those involved across new<br>zealand universities it's a wonderful<br>initiative<br>and very much of its time<br>i'd like to acknowledge my two previous<br>speakers tonight professor william<br>harris just before<br>me and of course ibrahim omar mp<br>a very local mp who's been a very<br>significant part<br>of the government's response to the<br>report of the royal commission of<br>inquiry<br>into the terrorist attack on the<br>christchurch mosques and that is the<br>subject of my<br>keynote this evening so i'll spend a<br>little<br>bit of time outlining the findings and<br>recommendations of the<br>royal commission the government's<br>response<br>to the report and the work now underway<br>but i'd also like to talk a little about<br>the<br>outreach and engagement the government<br>has conducted over the last few months<br>with the muslim community with other pan<br>faith<br>and pan ethnic communities and the<br>feedback and insights from<br>that engagement ibrahim<br>participated in all the hui across the<br>the country as did local mps from both<br>sides<br>of the house so great to have you with<br>us tonight<br>and i given this audience too i would<br>also like to touch on the role of<br>academia<br>and the institutions in this work<br>first i would like to acknowledge the 51<br>shuhada<br>those who were lost on that terrible day<br>on march 15<br>2019 and the affected whanau<br>witnesses and survivors as well as the<br>muslim community and all<br>impacted by that terrorist<br>attack these attacks were unprecedented<br>for new zealand and remain very<br>significant<br>on a global scale it had a horrific<br>traumatic impact<br>on the community in christchurch and a<br>wider new zealand<br>though more recently i've also had the<br>honor of engaging with that christchurch<br>community<br>and what an extraordinary community they<br>are with some remarkable courage<br>and strength the government responded<br>quickly<br>after the attacks in a number of ways<br>arms measures<br>the christchurch call and to ensure a<br>comprehensive<br>informed response the government set up<br>a royal commission<br>of inquiry which is the most significant<br>form of inquiry available<br>to any government its primary task was<br>to inquire<br>into whether public agencies could or<br>should have prevented the attacks<br>and what could or should have been done<br>for the future to prevent<br>a repeat the report was<br>presented to the governor general on 26<br>november<br>last year and shortly thereafter on<br>eight december<br>the government released the report in<br>full to the public so it was tabled in<br>the house<br>and with some initial responses<br>the government accepted the findings in<br>full and agreed to all 44<br>recommendations in principle<br>in terms of the findings the royal<br>commission found that there was no<br>failure of public agencies in respect of<br>preventing the attack<br>but also that there was an inappropriate<br>concentration of resources<br>on islamic terrorism though this did not<br>result in the terrorists<br>not being detected and failings in the<br>firearms licensing<br>system more broadly the royal commission<br>found failures in our national security<br>system<br>and significant deficiencies in our<br>social cohesion<br>and on social cohesion that we pride<br>ourselves<br>as new zealanders as in being a<br>welcoming people<br>in fact what came through was this was<br>not the experience for many<br>the 44 recommendations covered four<br>broad<br>areas to improve new zealand's<br>counterterrorism<br>effort to improve the firearms licensing<br>system<br>to support the ongoing recovery needs of<br>affected whanau<br>survivors and witnesses primarily the<br>christchurch muslim community<br>and to improve social cohesion and new<br>zealand's response to our increasingly<br>diverse population<br>in accepting all 44 recommendations in<br>principle<br>the government was also clear that its<br>response would not be bound simply by<br>the parameters set<br>by those 44 recommendations that it<br>would take a holistic approach<br>rather than considering each<br>recommendation in isolation<br>the government also determined a vision<br>and a set of principles to guide its<br>response<br>in terms of the vision it is for a<br>diverse<br>inclusive and safe new zealand<br>and in terms of the principles that the<br>treaty<br>and its principles would guide our<br>response that victims and whanau<br>are at the center of the response so a<br>community-centric<br>focus that we will strive for safer<br>communities in new zea and new zealand<br>that is more inclusive<br>with equal protections for all we will<br>be accountable and forward-looking<br>will be proactive in reaching out to<br>communities<br>and we will take practical actions that<br>on eight december the government<br>announced a number of<br>initial measures in its response<br>these included a range of social<br>cohesion initiatives<br>such as the safer communities fund the<br>announcement of a number of legislative<br>changes such as to the<br>terrorist suppression act on<br>counter-terrorism the creation of an<br>early intervention program<br>to help prevent radicalization<br>some machinery of government changes<br>including the lifting of the office of<br>ethnic communities<br>to a ministry of ethnic communities<br>the navigators and a collective impact<br>board which were to<br>uh are to support the affected community<br>and naming andrew little as lead<br>coordination minister<br>and with the prime minister remaining<br>very closely engaged across all this<br>work<br>supported by minister priyanka<br>radhakrishnan<br>after the public release the two<br>ministers embarked on a program of<br>nationwide hui<br>right across the country more than 33<br>engagements<br>from invercargill through to auckland<br>i'm starting initially and appropriately<br>in christchurch from december and then<br>across the country<br>over january and february and it was<br>very much a learning process<br>as we went and as uh ibrahim will be<br>able to attest<br>this was the first time that government<br>so ministers and a wide range of<br>agencies<br>mps from across across the country had<br>engaged in this way<br>with the muslim community and with other<br>faith-based<br>and ethnic communities each hui<br>had its own dynamics energy individual<br>stories<br>sometimes quite remarkable stories and<br>quite often quite<br>heart-wrenching stories always very<br>moving<br>but across the hui so each had its<br>individual character but across the hui<br>some very clear themes emerged these<br>being summarized and they've been placed<br>on the website<br>in a very deliberate wish to ensure<br>transparency<br>some of these themes include an ongoing<br>concern about government<br>accountability a focus on hate speech<br>and hate crimes<br>the need for cultural competency across<br>the public service<br>and notably in the education sector<br>which proved a consistent and very<br>strong theme<br>a focus on social cohesion and the need<br>to redress<br>for example discrimination in employment<br>concern at the portrayal of islam the<br>muslim community and ethnic communities<br>in the media<br>including in social media the need to<br>support<br>ongoing community engagement with<br>government<br>and the ongoing needs on the part of the<br>affected community in christchurch<br>and also throughout these engagements a<br>very strong<br>message from our muslim community itself<br>that they did not want to<br>the the government's response and this<br>process to be just about them<br>not to continue any sense of other<br>that this must be about communities<br>right across the country<br>and about our society were at large<br>and most other communities echoed the<br>concerns raised by the muslim community<br>and as further attestation the royal<br>commission itself produced a paper on<br>what we heard from affected whanau<br>survivors and witnesses and the things<br>that we heard over the course of the hui<br>some of these themes are not in fact<br>picked up by the royal commission and<br>not least<br>reflecting that they had to operate<br>under quite specific terms of reference<br>but you'll recall my comments earlier<br>that the government's response<br>is not found just by the 44<br>recommendations<br>so two areas that were picked up<br>were not picked up by the royal<br>commission recommendations<br>but which are very much a subject of<br>focus at present<br>are those around the education sector<br>and cultural competency<br>and also questions around the portrayal<br>of islam<br>and the muslim community by media<br>so we have work underway or in train uh<br>in all these areas<br>across all 44 recommendations<br>and for example the ministry of justice<br>is just about to conduct<br>public consultations around hate speech<br>and hate crime<br>and if the office of ethnic communities<br>is similarly<br>consulting on the new ministry we're<br>also continuing<br>our outreach and engagement more broadly<br>with a focus on maori pacifica<br>and rainbow and disability communities<br>some areas have or will see early<br>results<br>but for many what we're talking about is<br>generational change<br>societal change so some very large<br>projects that will take time<br>i mentioned an opening that i would also<br>touch on some issues of relevance to<br>academia<br>and one area highlighted by the royal<br>commission was the need<br>to lift the national discourse on<br>national security<br>to engage the public on issues such as<br>counter-terrorism<br>encountering violent extremism<br>a reflection taken from new zealand's<br>own counter-terrorism strategy<br>that the best defense against terrorism<br>is to have a resilient<br>inclusive society and one of the<br>initiatives announced on 8 december<br>is for a national center of excellence<br>on counter-terrorism<br>countering violent extremism and<br>promoting social cohesion<br>to lift the academic focus in these<br>areas this<br>is set in recommendation 14 with a<br>concentration on<br>independent new zealand-specific<br>research<br>to help inform public discussion and<br>guide the work of policy<br>agencies across government<br>we've been engaging very closely with<br>academic colleagues across the country<br>on the national center<br>with real support for this initiative<br>and we will be holding a ct<br>hui in christchurch on 1516 june<br>and that reflects a specific<br>recommendation number 16<br>with the intent that this will be the<br>launching pad for the national center of<br>excellence<br>so i'll just close with a couple of<br>quick reflections<br>we have an incredible opportunity<br>through the royal commission's report to<br>impact new zealand<br>and our society we have this<br>extraordinary diversity in new zealand<br>our muslim community other communities<br>people of different faiths and<br>ethnicities all contributing to the<br>richness of our society<br>but we're not doing nearly as well in<br>welcoming<br>and embracing this diversity as we might<br>think<br>and that is very clear ignorance<br>not necessarily hate or prejudice was<br>often cited<br>at the huis as the cause<br>and so this is where our academic<br>community<br>and initiatives like mesa come in<br>to redress ignorance to build knowledge<br>and understanding<br>to lift the public discourse and so to<br>help build the inclusive resilient<br>thank you very much okay so um<br>thank you very much to all three of our<br>speakers um<br>i want to hold you up at all just made<br>me think about just a quick story when<br>that terrible day um or the days after<br>that terrible day i was<br>i sat with my students in oman the<br>sultanate of oman<br>a group of young arab muslims and we<br>watched together live<br>the speech the prime minister made in<br>parliament in the days after that<br>and to a person and omani is not given<br>to spontaneity really<br>they got up on their feet and they<br>applauded a prime minister<br>so the government got off to a very good<br>start in the way that it<br>recovered and responded from that<br>terrorist attack<br>but as all of our speakers have shown<br>it's what happens<br>after that it's how we actually do<br>things tangibly<br>um after the event in terms of as<br>ibrahimov told us understanding the<br>contribution the immense contributions<br>of islamic civilization<br>understanding the complex politics of<br>the region having the linguistic skills<br>to be able to engage properly<br>in the region and also establishing the<br>policy frameworks<br>can actually make it happen in education<br>and all of those things<br>so thank you so much to everyone so<br>tomorrow mesa is having its first<br>workshop we've had a lot of meetings on<br>zoom so we're going to enjoy getting<br>together<br>and having some real good discussions<br>amongst the middle east scholars here in<br>new zealand<br>here on the campus tomorrow so we're<br>really looking forward to that but in<br>the meantime we really hope that you'll<br>join us for something to eat<br>and drink outside in the lobby here just<br>to the left<br>we have some prayer rooms available<br>there as well and<br>we really thank everyone for joining us<br>tonight and thank you so much<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
