nicholson<br>and i'm the acting vice chancellor of<br>the university of otago<br>and it's my pleasure to welcome you all<br>to this very special occasion<br>to celebrate the promotion of tim to<br>professor<br>and i'd like to welcome you all<br>colleagues students<br>tim's friends but i'd like to give a<br>special welcome<br>to tim's family his wife annabelle<br>and their two children vespa and tasman<br>tim's<br>parents alan and lorraine and sister<br>sarah<br>and his mother-in-law robin it's really<br>lovely that you can all join us today<br>now promotion to professor at otago is<br>not something that comes easily<br>and tim has gone through a rigorous<br>process to demonstrate<br>that he has achieved outstanding<br>sustained<br>sustained outstanding leadership and<br>sustained outstanding<br>competence in both research and service<br>and this involves us seeking feedback<br>from external<br>referees and experts across the world<br>and while in the moment professor<br>murdoch's going to<br>provide a biography in summary of tim's<br>achievements<br>i thought i'd like to share some of this<br>comments from the referees<br>which highlight tim's abilities and<br>explain how<br>fortunate we are to have tim as a member<br>of the university of otago christchurch<br>so these experts from across the world<br>described<br>tim as internationally recognized as a<br>leader in 3d printing<br>within the broader disciplines of<br>biomaterials and regen<br>regenerative medicine they talk of his<br>funding<br>record as being outstanding and they<br>highlight the success<br>and leadership tim has achieved in his<br>ability to address commercial<br>and pre-clinical translation within<br>within vivo studies<br>they comment on how he has patented and<br>licensed biomaterials<br>technology developed from his research<br>and captured venture capital<br>capital interest tim has done what many<br>of us<br>only aspire to do to translate research<br>from bench to bedside<br>they also talk of tim's commitment to<br>the wider scientific community<br>by his ability to attract and mentor top<br>phd students<br>and post-docs and thus build the future<br>leaders<br>of research as well as this<br>they comment on his willingness to<br>engage with disseminating his research<br>to the wider community and industry<br>as one person summed up tim is a leader<br>in his field<br>and a researcher on whom to model best<br>research practice<br>congratulations tim i'm really looking<br>forward to your lecture<br>good evening everyone and for those who<br>don't know me my name is david murdock<br>i'm the dean and head of campus here at<br>the university of otago christchurch and<br>and i want to extend my my welcome to<br>you all as well<br>um i know there's been a bit of a hiccup<br>i think the first<br>time we tried to have this event and<br>it's wonderful that we're able to<br>hold this event under level one we had<br>to hold one under level two a few weeks<br>ago and<br>it's wonderful that we're able to<br>congregate as as normal here today<br>inaugural professorial lectures are a<br>real source of pride<br>uh for us and i mean this uh and a very<br>special event and this is<br>this is certainly no exception<br>my role here is to introduce tim<br>to keep it brief and not to steal his<br>thunder<br>so i really just want to go briefly give<br>a brief<br>biography hitting on some high notes and<br>in tim's stellar career<br>tim was born in dunedin and and spent<br>most of his<br>schooling and universal schooling years<br>in christchurch and<br>apart from some time in adelaide and i<br>think tim's probably going to<br>expand on on some of that part of his<br>life<br>as we know he's an engineer and we don't<br>see too many engineers in<br>a healthcare environment but i certainly<br>have<br>as i've said many times appreciated<br>interacting with engineers<br>and their ability to solve problems in<br>their way of thinking<br>um tim studied at the university of<br>canterbury<br>he's a bachelor of engineering with<br>honours degree in mechanical engineering<br>graduating in 1997.<br>he was awarded a templin scholarship<br>to travel to canada to the university of<br>toronto<br>where he completed a two-year masters<br>and applied sciences<br>at the institute of biomaterials and and<br>biomedical engineering at that<br>institution and i had to<br>look up what the templin scholarship was<br>and<br>this is uh the templin travelling<br>scholarship is one of the most lucrative<br>and well supported<br>postgraduate scholarships in engineering<br>and horticulture in new zealand and<br>reflects<br>the two interests of of the donor so<br>both<br>engineering and horticulture and my<br>understanding is<br>is to support travel mainly to north<br>america<br>tim then traveled to across to the<br>netherlands<br>and to the<br>institute of biomedical technology at<br>the university of tuente<br>and we're there studied for his phd<br>completing that in 2004 followed by a<br>postdoctoral fellowship at the same<br>institution<br>returned to new zealand about 2006 and<br>had<br>roles both at i noted both at the<br>university of canterbury and here at the<br>university of otago christchurch<br>and really started the<br>um the group we now know as the<br>christchurch regenerative medicine<br>tissue engineering the create group<br>around 2009 when he was a research<br>fellow that's part of our department of<br>orthopedics in<br>musculoskeletal medicine tim was<br>promoted to<br>senior research fellow in 2011<br>i was a rutherford discovery fellow<br>between 2012 and 2017<br>was promoted research associate<br>professor in 2015 and<br>as we know last year was promoted to<br>research professor<br>along with our colleagues in the in the<br>mars imaging<br>tim and his group have really been<br>critical in establishing<br>the university of otago's biomedical<br>engineering footprint here in<br>in christchurch and really that is major<br>footprint for the whole of the<br>university of otago and biomedical<br>engineering<br>it's really been critical and with his<br>interests<br>particularly researching strategies for<br>musculoskeletal tissue regeneration<br>specifically<br>with carthage and bone and the<br>replication of orthopedic devices and<br>cell-based therapies<br>has really been a world leader and<br>pioneered<br>the development of several technology<br>platforms which i think we<br>will be hearing about and i'm imagining<br>there'll be some images in your<br>presentation which i look forward to<br>tim's won many honours and awards and<br>note he's got<br>adjunct or honorary faculty positions at<br>three other<br>three other institutions at least that<br>i'm aware of the queensland institute of<br>tech<br>queensland university of technology and<br>the universities of auckland and<br>canterbury as well as<br>obviously here at university of otago he<br>was<br>last year was awarded the research<br>excellence award from the<br>australian society for biomaterials and<br>tissue engineering<br>and is the first new zealander to be<br>elected fellow biomaterials<br>science and engineering by the<br>international union of societies and<br>biomaterials science and engineering<br>real mouthful but wonderful honor<br>turmoil i am going to stop here and and<br>really look forward to<br>to hearing your lecture today so welcome<br>and first of all thank you very much<br>helen for the very kind words<br>and also to david and<br>i would just like to spend i guess the<br>next this evening giving you<br>my thoughts my own words on my research<br>journey<br>to to professor and how i came to end up<br>in this position<br>so the talk was let's get personal so<br>i'm going to get personal a lot of<br>different events so don't<br>don't worry i'm not going to reveal all<br>of my life's secrets<br>this evening but i'll give you a few<br>tidbits<br>and a few i guess experiences in terms<br>of my journey along the way<br>so i would start with my journey into<br>research uh i'll talk a little bit about<br>cartilage<br>you're not going to be able to leave the<br>room until you hear a little bit about<br>cartilage this evening<br>there's some different technology<br>developments we've achieved obviously<br>primarily<br>a lot to do with printing and<br>bioprinting and<br>i'll discuss a few challenges and future<br>directions<br>before we go too far in terms of how i<br>got into research well i come from a<br>very sort of education based<br>background um i'm not the first dr<br>woodfield in the family so um<br>my sister sarah studied uh dentistry at<br>the university of otago so there's some<br>those links actually go a lot further<br>back so<br>my father actually lectured at the<br>university of otago from 1967 to 1975.<br>there's no pictures of him but actually<br>there's a there's a photo of the uh the<br>atari university cricket club<br>um and i can maybe try and point out<br>very young<br>uh ellen woodfield up there<br>but digging up this i found there's an<br>older older family uh story all about um<br>his appointment actually to um to<br>university of otago so<br>um he uh he actually accepted the<br>position<br>um uh having previously been the<br>uh the barman at the invercargill grand<br>hotel<br>and arriving at the university of otago<br>in his lecturing position<br>promptly received a<br>20 pay cut to take up that lucrative<br>position<br>at the university of otago and he<br>lectured economics there<br>as david mentioned our family moved to<br>australia when i was about<br>six months old and he had a position at<br>flinders university teaching<br>economics theater and then the family<br>came back when i was about five years<br>old<br>i had been in new zealand ever since and<br>dad remained lecturing in economics at<br>the university of<br>canterbury as professor there for until<br>he retired<br>my mom was very much in education she's<br>she's a teacher spent a lot of time<br>in special needs teaching so i spent a<br>lot of time<br>teaching hearing impaired children at<br>vanesh college some of you may remember<br>vanash<br>and also a number of different primary<br>schools around so<br>some of you may get to talk to her later<br>and see her expression and other things<br>in terms of her<br>her sign language which has never<br>managed to disappear but um<br>so i was always interested in how i can<br>design and build things but i thought<br>well if we're getting personal then we<br>might as well jump straight to the<br>problem what are we trying to fix what<br>are we trying to repair<br>what do we mean when we're talking about<br>personalised regenerative medicine<br>well there's a number of different<br>things of course you know our bodies are<br>designed<br>to be extremely forgiving but obviously<br>we end up with broken bones so again<br>there's a couple of examples here of a<br>intra-articular fracture in the wrist<br>which requires them plating to try and<br>fix<br>there's some other examples here of then<br>fractures within<br>metatarsals again common uh<br>injuries around collar bone fractures um<br>some of the other<br>little bit more serious ones are then a<br>disc evolution so this is mri of a<br>c5 c6 spine or you might see<br>a disc avulsion or prolapsed disc<br>and then getting a little bit more into<br>sort of the knee and hip again you can<br>then also have damage for disease to<br>meniscal so this is a medial meniscal<br>tear um<br>under um minimally invasive surgery<br>and the reason i can give a personalized<br>spin to this as well<br>so you might um have a couple of<br>hypotheses out of this and think well<br>one one hypothesis could be um i'm<br>extremely<br>um<br>prone to injury that's one hypothesis um<br>but it's a<br>it's an incorrect hypothesis um the the<br>actual correct hypothesis is just<br>just that i'm um extremely collegial<br>what it's meant is that i've been able<br>to get to meet a large number of my<br>orthopedic colleagues<br>so a number of them in the audience<br>today so thank you<br>alan cockfield for fixing my wrist thank<br>you tom sharp for my finger thank you<br>alex malone for helping treat my collar<br>bone fracture<br>also alex and graham ingles for<br>my spine injuries and also then steve<br>parkerson and also<br>gary hooper for helping with with some<br>but as you see a lot of those ones you<br>know some sometimes our bones have the<br>capability to regenerate but<br>um in a lot of those other cases you<br>know we had we we required implants<br>um so again we were trying to replace or<br>we're trying to use permanent<br>non-degradable implants to try and<br>repair damaged tissues so what if<br>what if we could regenerate rather than<br>replace and that's really the promise of<br>regenerative medicine<br>so it's extremely multi-disciplinary<br>field and essentially<br>what it tries to combine is concepts or<br>theories from cell biology to tissue<br>engineering<br>biomaterial science and then surgical<br>transplantation<br>science and it really involves three<br>major components so cells are the<br>building blocks in our body so we<br>require cells to make different types of<br>tissues<br>if you give those cells the right<br>potential signals<br>then they can actually start making the<br>target tissue that you would like<br>if you then wrap up those cells in some<br>sort of package some sort of<br>three-dimensional environment then you<br>give<br>the cells all the right micro<br>environment to to make<br>new tissues and this picture of this um<br>this mouse with an ear on it on its back<br>isn't actually a functional ear<br>but it was something that really<br>kick-started the field of regenerative<br>medicine<br>um it was um widely publicized in the<br>media at the time<br>um and essentially what it is is a<br>scaffold which it was<br>was a subcutaneous implantation<br>implanted on the back of this mouse<br>now cells were able to invade into this<br>into this porous scaffold<br>and just to form a shape in an ear<br>so there was a lot of promise the idea<br>was well this could start<br>the beginning of of a field of<br>regenerative medicine there was already<br>a lot<br>understood around by materials science<br>there was already a lot understood<br>around<br>but as i was also going and preparing<br>for this and looking back through some<br>of my notes within my phd thesis i came<br>across this um this saying from blaise<br>pascal and i think it's one of those<br>ones and it's very<br>poignant i guess point within our field<br>is that um because it's very<br>multi-disciplinary you know pascal was<br>saying that since we cannot know all<br>there is to be known about anything<br>we ought to know a little about<br>everything and i think that's really<br>important<br>because a lot of the different<br>innovation breakthroughs around trying<br>to connect the dots across multiple<br>different<br>multidisciplinary fields and this field<br>certainly<br>so the title of this talk was around<br>orchestrating tissue development<br>in personalized and regenerative<br>medicine so what do i mean by<br>orchestrating<br>well some of you might see this little<br>cartoon on the left<br>and be aware of stem cells so i wanted<br>to try and provide a brief introduction<br>while i was while i was moving forward<br>to introduce you to stem cells so what<br>this cartoon says<br>again this is a stem cell parental<br>advice there's a little stem cell that's<br>sitting in the bottom of this petri dish<br>and the the bubble is saying you can be<br>anything you want to be when you grow up<br>and that's essentially a little bit what<br>a stem cell is<br>it has the potential to be a number of<br>any particular type of<br>a cell within the body but to an a<br>certain extent<br>so stem cells are progenitor cells which<br>are circulating in the body<br>one of the more popular ones a bone<br>marrow derived stem cells that are<br>circulating within or reside within your<br>bone marrow<br>there are hema poetic stem cells which<br>are responsible for then<br>generating some of the blood components<br>so red blood cells<br>but primarily um adult stem cells<br>are required for tissue regeneration<br>they're circulating cells that then home<br>to a point of injury and have the<br>capability as a progenitor cell to then<br>start to differentiate<br>along a number of different lineages<br>these particular stem cells are called<br>stem cells<br>if you can define them there's a lot of<br>controversy exactly how you define a<br>stem cell<br>but they have the capability of<br>self-renewing so they can self-renew<br>multiple times and then when they get to<br>a particular region or they receive a<br>particular type of cue they can<br>differentiate down a pathway so they<br>might become a bone cell<br>which would then be a cell that starts<br>making bone it could become a cartilage<br>cell for example that might be a cell<br>that starts making cartilage for example<br>now there's a broad range of different<br>types of stem cells but the idea is that<br>they require a micro environment they<br>require some information<br>to try and um to perform their role<br>so they need cues they need micro<br>environments or a niche<br>and you can consider this environment or<br>our<br>ability as regenerative engineers as<br>being a little bit like a<br>like a conductor so you've got a number<br>of different factors you can try trying<br>to control a number of different types<br>of cells<br>and actually if you can coordinate all<br>of these cells and cues and the micro<br>environment into the right niche<br>then you'll be able to perform a one<br>wonderful symphony and that symphony<br>then is then<br>um a particular type of tissue or you<br>get your functional tissue regeneration<br>so that's essentially our job as we're<br>trying to understand biology we're<br>trying to understand what individual<br>cells are doing and how we can recreate<br>that<br>to to allow us to to regenerate damaged<br>tissues<br>so um in evolutionary and developmental<br>biology of living tissues<br>uh form always follows functions so<br>in that particular case the form of our<br>particular types of tissues<br>are derived very much from their<br>function they're an evolutionary<br>development of<br>of of the of their of their tissue so<br>for example bone it has uh it's able to<br>respond to load<br>uh it's able to resorb it's able to lay<br>down new bone based on<br>environmental cues provided by the body<br>and i guess the promise of regenerative<br>medicine is that<br>if we can try and then engineer tissues<br>that mimic<br>the native tissues does that mean that<br>they will then have their particular<br>type of function and this is really<br>important for<br>orthopedic tissues is because our<br>orthopedic tissues are the ones that<br>carry all the loads through our body so<br>they're the ones that have to be able to<br>perform function properly if we engineer<br>tissues that don't have the right<br>properties then of course they're not<br>going to function properly<br>and one way you can kind of consider how<br>that micro environment might be arranged<br>within the body is actually to consider<br>a layout of a city<br>so again what you have is you might<br>consider all the different cells of the<br>different people they're all moving in<br>around they've got neighborhoods<br>they've got lots of different arterioles<br>or<br>passageways which they can move in and<br>out they have<br>a micro environment which is essentially<br>your neighborhoods and there's all the<br>right support structures that you need<br>to try and make the city nice and<br>healthy<br>but as you can see is that this<br>particular of the city is planar it's a<br>two-dimensional plane so what you have<br>to try and think of is that all of those<br>things are happening in with the body<br>in terms of creating a niche but it<br>so that's a little primer just around<br>regenerative medicine and a brief<br>background<br>so how did i end up then in this<br>particular um in this particular field<br>and as david mentioned i did start out<br>in mechanical engineering<br>so there's a scruffy picture of me in in<br>1996 with<br>some long hair studying mechanical<br>engineering at canterbury university<br>and what i loved about engineering is<br>that i really was fascinated about<br>designing things<br>i was really fascinated about how<br>how things worked and throughout<br>engineering um i became<br>very interested in engineering materials<br>so materials science is a very important<br>part of engineering<br>and uh from that point i thought right<br>well my sister had just started in<br>dentistry and i did a project<br>also that was trying to look at how we<br>can incorporate our engineering<br>principles into biology<br>and that's how i got introduced to the<br>department of orthopedic surgery<br>actually<br>so i was doing some projects i actually<br>did some summer studentships as an<br>engineering student here within the<br>university<br>that time with professor alastair<br>rothwell hrd of orthopedics at the time<br>and the project was actually involving<br>tetraplegic patients so my theory for<br>his project<br>and also my final year project in<br>engineering was trying to develop a<br>device that would measure<br>muscle strength in tetraplegic patients<br>and it was pretty much<br>it was essentially involved measuring<br>arm strength<br>now as a tetraplegia and paralysis<br>then you've got extremely limited body<br>function<br>below the shoulder line and there's<br>certain muscles that do work and don't<br>and one big problem for tetraplegic<br>patients<br>is around arm function and it really<br>significantly limits the quality of life<br>and their<br>ability to form functional tasks now<br>aleister had helped pioneer<br>a surgery which was called um uh<br>tendon transfer surgery and he he coined<br>this phrase<br>the triodometer which essentially<br>explained explained a<br>tendon transfer surgery that he<br>performed so what he would do is<br>actually take one muscle that was<br>actually functional so that was the<br>posterior deltoid muscle in the shoulder<br>and he'd try transfer that to<br>essentially unpin it and transfer it to<br>where the<br>triceps muscle would work and this<br>essentially would give<br>an arm extension uh strength capability<br>to these<br>um to these tetraplegia patients<br>likewise<br>it also transfer one of the muscles in<br>the arm brachioradialis<br>to then try and give essentially a<br>tenodesis type grip<br>so this is a really great example of a<br>really personalized medicine so where<br>you're taking muscles that do function<br>transferring them to an area where they<br>don't function<br>and what it was able to do was to give<br>patients tetraplegia patients the<br>ability to raise their arm above their<br>head<br>wheel their wheelchairs but also give<br>them the ability<br>in terms of lifting their wrist the<br>ability to then actually grasp<br>and pinch things where they didn't<br>normally have hand function<br>so i built this troidometer and it was<br>really great it was used for a number of<br>years in terms of collecting patient<br>data<br>so that was one of my very first<br>experiences in um<br>as as david mentioned i then went<br>overseas to the university of toronto<br>and<br>i was peaked to go there primarily<br>because of my interest in biomaterials<br>so this is really my journey into<br>biomaterial science<br>i was extremely lucky i didn't know it<br>at the time how prestigious biomaterials<br>was<br>when i first arrived it was really<br>called the the institute for biomedical<br>engineering but it actually changed its<br>name to the institute of biomaterials<br>and biomedical engineering because of<br>the strength of its biomaterials program<br>i worked with professor bob pilliar<br>he worked in the faculty of dentistry<br>and that's actually the origins of<br>biomaterial science studies<br>has has drawn out of dental medicine and<br>and the development of materials<br>required for oral health<br>and i was based with him just opposite<br>the road was also there mount sinai<br>hospital<br>where i worked with professor rita<br>candel she was in pathology and very<br>much<br>focused on cartilage and cartilage<br>repair<br>and also with mark grimpus who was a<br>bone biologist<br>um developing um technologies including<br>bisphosphonates for um for treatment of<br>osteoporosis i had some fantastic<br>lectures with it with another professor<br>um davies who was a bone biologist and<br>also dentist<br>and he taught us all about um how bone<br>formed and<br>i remember these hilarious lectures<br>where he'd all have a standing up<br>pretending to be osteoblasts<br>reaching out our hands and so i can and<br>clearly we're all contacting each other<br>um but he was a great proponent and a<br>really strong believer in<br>in in proper definitions in the field<br>and really critically assessing<br>um manuscripts so he was<br>doing a lot of fundamental research and<br>i really learned a lot also from jed<br>in terms of um<br>understanding the correct definitions<br>and proper usage um<br>and and undertaking methodical research<br>to actually<br>um undertake<br>or prove different mechanistic aspects<br>one project there first introduced me to<br>carthage and so this is one of the<br>images from my from my<br>master thesis which i really like um it<br>beautifully shows the really complex<br>architecture of articular cartilage so<br>the red the red section um is this<br>underlying subchondral bone<br>the sort of orangey colour is this<br>calcified cartilage and then the the<br>purpley blue stuff is this cartilage<br>layer on the top of all of our joints so<br>it's<br>it has this fantastic job of shock<br>absorbing and<br>transferring load to all of our joints<br>and i was working with them to try and<br>understand the<br>biomechanics of the interface between<br>this cartilage in this bone<br>so i developed a device to help shear<br>these<br>different types of tissue from the bone<br>and the main reason was that the group<br>was developing different types of<br>biomaterials at the time some calcium<br>polyphosphates to try and mimic<br>uh the calcium phosphate based materials<br>that we have in native bone<br>and also then tissue engineering<br>cartilage structures on top<br>and i was able to do some measurements<br>to then try and understand<br>first of all what the requirements were<br>in native tissue but then what would we<br>need to do if we were going to try and<br>engineer these types of tissues<br>what types of mechanical properties but<br>that introduced me to biomaterials<br>as well as some tissue engineering<br>principles in<br>cartilage i then moved um<br>to the netherlands and i worked with the<br>university of twente but i was actually<br>based within a<br>biotech company called isotope ortho<br>biologics<br>it was pioneered by two dutch professors<br>so professor clemens van blitzweik<br>and uh classic growth and they were both<br>biomaterial scientists but very<br>entrepreneurial and had actually<br>established this company<br>it was one of the first tissue<br>engineering companies in europe at the<br>time<br>and essentially it was trying to develop<br>products for tissue and genetic<br>cartilage for bone<br>as well as skin before i go too far<br>though i'd really like to<br>mention a little bit about cartilage and<br>this is a 250 year old statement<br>it's from a paper written by hunter and<br>it's from 1743 so that the language is a<br>little bit odd<br>but hunter stated that already 250 years<br>ago<br>if we consult the standard surgical<br>writers from hypocrisy<br>down to the present age we shall find<br>that an<br>ulcerated cartilage so diseased<br>cartilage is universally allowed<br>to be very troublesome disease and<br>essentially the highlight of bit is that<br>once cattle is destroyed<br>it's um it's never recovered and that's<br>a major problem that we have is that we<br>um osteoarthritis and damage to<br>cartilage<br>um due to mechanical imbalances and also<br>disease state within within our joints<br>now you might sort of think well why is<br>it that cartilage<br>doesn't have a regenerative capacity so<br>once you've damaged your cartilage<br>there's very inherent<br>capacity for it to self-repair and while<br>if you actually look back through<br>life expectancies um for<br>it may well be all the way back to um to<br>neanderthals and<br>when we were hung together as our life<br>expectancy we were designed for was<br>around 30 to 40 years and so it didn't<br>really matter if we got osteoarthritis<br>because our life expectancy wasn't<br>providing us long enough<br>to to experience any osteoarthritis<br>so as you see from from the around the<br>1900s onwards<br>there was a huge explosion in life<br>expectancy due to breakthroughs in<br>medicine<br>um but part of the reason uh that we may<br>not necessarily be designed<br>uh we never had a regenerative capacity<br>with our cartilage could have been<br>um uh evolutionary again that's just a<br>hypothesis<br>but what are we going to do to try and<br>fix this<br>is osteoarthritis a serious disease yes<br>and so a little bit more history and i<br>guess if we were looking at<br>michelangelo's david in the 21st century<br>might look something rather like this so<br>again the micro environment we're<br>putting our knees under<br>is very different so oa is very serious<br>um affects large number of the the<br>population one in eight new zealanders<br>suffer osteoarthritis<br>limits life no way has no cure so<br>there's no disease modifying<br>osteoarthritis drugs currently available<br>surgery is able to replace but not<br>restore so surgery is often total joint<br>replacement and that's obviously what<br>our<br>orthopedic surgeons are involved in<br>so one takeaway of course and that you<br>can try and get from this<br>is obviously that if we remain active is<br>a very very good way of trying to<br>prevent osteoarthritis<br>but clearly we need other solutions<br>other than potentially total joint<br>replacements to repair<br>arthritis if we look at some of our own<br>data and some of the data that gary has<br>published recently<br>due to demographic aging obesity<br>and people living more active lives the<br>um the numbers of<br>joint replacement patients is going to<br>increase rapidly<br>so in new zealand out to 2030 a bit<br>under 300 increase<br>and the numbers out of the u.s are even<br>even worse a little bit under 700<br>increase in the total<br>numbers of total knee replacements<br>required<br>uh moving forward so more and more<br>patients are having implants and<br>and then we have more and more patients<br>having problems so wouldn't it be great<br>if we could<br>regenerate rather than restore and so<br>this is a looming<br>problem in our healthcare system within<br>so i wanted to give you that background<br>about cartilage because that was the<br>primary focus of my my<br>phd work and so i just want to try and<br>introduce a couple of my initial<br>publications or my very first<br>publications<br>and actually my first publication was a<br>review and i found it rather daunting as<br>a phd student to write a large review<br>but the reason i wanted to mention it<br>tonight is it really<br>nicely highlights um what the capability<br>of a scaffold is<br>to try and help orchestrate how we can<br>form different types of tissues<br>so since the early 20th century we've<br>been able to culture<br>cells in 2d so we can put cells on a<br>flat surface and study what they do but<br>our tissues are three-dimensional so<br>studying cells in 2d is a little bit of<br>a waste of time<br>and if we'd like to make tissues then we<br>need a 3d micro environment and so<br>these 3d scaffolds are essentially the<br>central way of being able to deliver<br>or helping orchestrate a number of<br>different types of things so<br>first of all the scaffold provides a<br>micro environment for cells to be placed<br>on<br>it provides an environment where we can<br>provide bioactive factors<br>different mechanical stimuli gene<br>therapies<br>a range of different aspects we'd like<br>to try and build if we can try and<br>create a niche and while these scaffolds<br>can then of course be implanted in vivo<br>and again the idea is that these<br>scaffolds are degradable so over a<br>period of time<br>they would degrade within the body<br>whilst new tissue is able to mature and<br>form<br>i guess one of my um most favorable<br>sort of publications the one i think of<br>most fondly of was was this one<br>it was the first paper where i described<br>3d printing so this was in about 2002<br>when i started doing some 3d printing<br>and i developed a device<br>which was able to essentially take a<br>polymer material<br>this is a polymer that was helped and<br>developed by by isaatus<br>um of also ether polymer block copolymer<br>and it's a really interesting material<br>because you could vary the different<br>blocks<br>so you could have hydrophobic blocks<br>hydrophilic blocks<br>some that were soft some that were hard<br>and you could arrange this block<br>copolymer to then have a range of<br>different properties<br>and control its degradation the nice<br>thing was that you could thermally<br>process it and so by that means i mean<br>you could heat it up<br>and you could try and extrude it out of<br>a nozzle and<br>um i was fascinated by this idea around<br>having some control so all engineers are<br>a little<br>a little bit of a control and control<br>enthusiasts i would say rather than<br>control freaks<br>um but the idea is that i really like<br>this idea because again if we could<br>control as much as we could about the<br>scaffold then we could open it up to<br>some of the biology which you have a lot<br>less control around<br>nevertheless we were able to create<br>these really intricate organized<br>structures where everything was exactly<br>layered you could modify the fibre<br>spacing and that allowed you to tailor<br>the mechanical properties and a range of<br>different things<br>but um yeah this went into biomaterials<br>which is kind of the the premier<br>biomaterials journal at the time<br>and the funny thing was is that was sort<br>of one of my major first papers<br>and um it got accepted without revisions<br>um<br>and um and i thought oh this is great<br>this publishing thing<br>is um is a piece of cake um<br>publishing is never is never a piece of<br>cake but um it just shows it was a<br>really nice paper it was um<br>it was timed really well and<br>it's been yeah one of my highly most<br>highly sighted papers around<br>so um the rest of my thesis was all<br>around um<br>showing that the you know scaffolds have<br>the right to make the right difference<br>so again if we have these ordered<br>structures we can get the<br>properties right we can then control<br>the interaction cells have with those<br>materials<br>and so not just the architecture<br>but then also the composition of the<br>biomaterial are really critical<br>so in this slide basically if we can<br>take a 3d printed<br>organized structure which is completely<br>interconnecting so the poor network is<br>100 and connecting<br>we can control a number of different<br>things in terms of then how<br>the number of cells that are able to<br>remain in it the quality of the tissue<br>the cells make<br>we can modify whether we would like cell<br>adhesion<br>and the organization of the tissue and<br>also things like nutrient gradients<br>so again if you get that right then you<br>can actually form functional tissues<br>whereas if you then use other different<br>types of more random manufacturing<br>process for the scaffold<br>another study you did at the time was<br>was also one of these first sort of<br>translational studies<br>and we were trying to look at recreating<br>or joint resurfacing and this was done<br>with<br>university hospital in zurich and we<br>were trying to look at<br>rapid prototyping both the female and<br>tibial component<br>of a of a rabbit knee which approximated<br>then also the dimensions of<br>of a finger joint and so we're able to<br>use all of the technology we developed<br>in terms of rapid prototyping<br>um these scaffolds and it really<br>highlights the capability of<br>3d printing where we can take a ct scan<br>of the geometry we would like<br>and then be able to try and 3d print a<br>shape that<br>exactly matches that anatomy but with a<br>porous structure that we can then<br>incorporate cells into<br>one of the major components was of<br>course that we can have the right<br>mechanical properties and amongst that<br>we were able to show that in a vivo<br>environment with the right tissue we can<br>have two tissue engineered joints<br>articulating over one another<br>and we could get excellent bone<br>integration and was one of the first<br>studies where you're taking an anatomic<br>3d printed scaffold<br>with um with cells to be able to try and<br>recreate the joint<br>unfortunately we weren't able to get all<br>of the tissue exactly<br>uh how it is in native structures so<br>there was an awful lot we still needed<br>to try and do beyond that<br>but i was able to successfully defend<br>defend my thesis and it was fantastic to<br>um one of my thesis examiners um<br>sprung a bit of surprise on me and<br>mentioned a few things in dutch which i<br>wasn't really expecting because the<br>whole<br>exam was in um was in english um<br>maybe one of my dutch students could<br>could translate this very briefly<br>shouted out you can't teach an old dog<br>new tricks yeah and so<br>during my thesis defense i was wondering<br>why my examiner was talking about old<br>dogs because i could follow most of it<br>um but his point was that while cells<br>cells have<br>a lot of history and while all of this<br>great material science<br>can you still can you still really<br>change these cells and so it was a<br>really interesting question and it's<br>something that's continued on with me<br>but some of this work around 3d printing<br>that i did and then<br>a large number of others i really tried<br>to turn the tides on<br>on how we were considering what tissues<br>were able to do and tissues that were<br>able to form<br>so we really were able to try and change<br>some dogma again one example is in the<br>bone literature at the time<br>people were saying that while a scaffold<br>that has certain structure and pores<br>greater than only 300 micron will form<br>bone and other structures won't<br>and it really dictated what all of the<br>different implants were made from<br>but a lot of these different structures<br>had these kind of random architectures<br>and so<br>um when a lot of the 3d printing work<br>and 3d printing of these degraded wood<br>materials came along it really changed<br>what we could do we were able to get<br>bone formed<br>in scaffolds that had architectures that<br>were totally different<br>huge pores you know two or three<br>millimeters large<br>and it really opened up and changed how<br>then implants could be designed and<br>offered a whole new<br>capability<br>i was a bit sick of living in some of<br>the flattest places in the world<br>um netherlands being almost<br>underwater and um i then of course came<br>back to new zealand<br>and i wanted to try and start up a group<br>here i did some lecturing<br>as as david mentioned at university of<br>canterbury um<br>but also was um uh heavily involved with<br>both alistar rothwell and also gary<br>hooper<br>at the time in terms of setting up a<br>regenerative medicine group<br>i got some of my first um large envy<br>grants whilst here we did some work on<br>on magnesium to try and look at ways of<br>where we could<br>manufacture degradable metals so of<br>course if we could<br>uh germinate metals that could be<br>degradable then uh that we could provide<br>stiffness<br>and mechanical function at the same time<br>a capability of being able to then look<br>at regenerative processes<br>so there was a lot of different work<br>along with some calibrate collaborators<br>at canterbury<br>and we we also were able to in this case<br>look at ways of additive manufacturing<br>molten magnesium one of the problems<br>with magnesium is that as it degrades<br>it gives off hydrogen gas<br>and magnesium hydroxide so again often<br>some of these materials used almost a<br>century ago would cause these large<br>bubbles under the skin due to the gas<br>accumulation and so<br>um we did quite a lot of work to try and<br>slow down this degradation process<br>using different types of coatings and<br>other things and developed some quite<br>um then this happened um<br>i won't focus on it but it it was a sort<br>of significant<br>event for obviously everyone in the room<br>and for canterbury<br>um it changed a lot of plans in terms of<br>how we were able to undertake any<br>research at the time and if you look at<br>parallels to covert<br>um our building was was out of<br>commission some of you might recognize<br>these<br>nice pictures of the of our stairwell<br>which was had to be completely<br>reconstructed and<br>it's quite difficult to do cell cultures<br>when the ground is moving and you lose<br>a lot of experiments due to due to<br>spills in that case but<br>we were able to soldier on and obviously<br>i'm hugely thankful to um the group<br>ender lab over the road where i was able<br>to carry on doing a lot of our<br>experimental work through these very<br>challenging times<br>i did want to try and acknowledge just<br>here some other work and being in a<br>department in multi-disciplinary<br>research um i was<br>very excited to be part of joanne<br>natalie's<br>phd thesis and also worked with kath<br>mcpherson from aut and other colleagues<br>in the department<br>and it was really looking at um our<br>return to work and and<br>qualitative methods which i hadn't<br>necessarily been that involved with<br>and it was just really nice um i was<br>um hugely thankful or wanted to say a<br>huge thanks<br>uh on behalf of also joe for all of the<br>volunteers that contributed<br>uh into her interview process and some<br>of the data that we were able to get out<br>of that work<br>um which hopefully has also changed<br>processes not here in new zealand but<br>also<br>internationally for how we look at<br>treating patients post<br>post-earthquake or severely injured<br>patients post earthquake and how they<br>can<br>transition back into the workplace both<br>for patients and also for<br>employers<br>so um in the next while uh what i would<br>just like to try and<br>shift gears a little bit um is to some<br>of the things we've really done in other<br>bigger grants that we've also managed to<br>it<br>to achieve so um one thing that<br>that 3d printing offers is it allows you<br>to really embrace<br>complexity now as engineers often we<br>quite like things that are complex<br>because we can try and nut out ways to<br>try and<br>simplify each of those different steps<br>down<br>so if we're trying to think about<br>medical device manufacturing and if<br>we're starting to move towards also now<br>looking at 3d printing titanium and<br>metals<br>one massive advantage that you get with<br>additive manufacturing is that it<br>doesn't matter if you try to print<br>something that's really simple additive<br>manufacturing is really good at also<br>printing things that are really really<br>complex it takes about the same amount<br>of<br>time and also cost so again 3d printing<br>being a layer by layer process where you<br>can make something very simple<br>or you can make very very complex<br>structures lends itself to<br>to medical device manufacturing<br>um i've been lucky enough to then get<br>some other envy funding working with<br>local medical device company<br>that had been pioneering the development<br>of 3d printed titanium<br>implants again this is very much<br>personalized medicine where<br>again there was almost<br>these near-impossible cases where<br>surgeons had very<br>limited options in terms of what they<br>could do to try and treat for example<br>this case here where you've got<br>essentially<br>a dislocation of an entire hip implant<br>into the pelvis region<br>which had also no bone stock remaining<br>so the idea with 3d printing of course<br>is you can use the patient's data<br>you can to to generate a medical scan<br>you can then recreate the particular<br>anatomy that's required<br>because you can then 3d print exactly<br>the shape that you want and then also<br>porous structures to try and get<br>all important integration and also screw<br>fixation<br>you can generate a patient-matched<br>device so this is essentially a patient<br>a device that's matched directly to the<br>patient's anatomy<br>and there's been amazing results from<br>this again um<br>in a number of different studies and<br>it's been um fascinating to see where<br>the technology has gone<br>so the msc we can try and look at ways<br>of of repairing<br>these damaged hip implants<br>and have outcomes similar to a standard<br>hip replacement<br>because of the fact that we can have it<br>specifically tuned directly to the<br>patient's anatomy and the fit<br>so we were able to work further as part<br>of this grant to try and<br>help further optimize what that what the<br>micro environment was for these<br>particular types of cells or how we can<br>improve integration<br>and there's a number of different<br>examples we were working on in this case<br>it also focused on spine but what we're<br>able to do is to work<br>work through different finite element<br>methods to understand what the<br>mechanical environment<br>was a lot of the different types of<br>3d printed implants are designed to<br>personally match the anatomy but what we<br>really want to do in some of these<br>studies is work at mechanical matching<br>so<br>how can we not only design the anatomy<br>of the implant but then also<br>the porous structure to try and interact<br>with the surrounding bone so that we get<br>the best possible fixation<br>and potentially even improve on some<br>existing existing approaches<br>so what we were able to do in the study<br>was to try and<br>totally sort of revamp or revisit how<br>3d printing implants were working the<br>types of structures we were able to try<br>and create<br>and what we were investigating this case<br>was looking at spine fusion which is a<br>requirement where you would like to<br>fix problems in the spine by by<br>essentially fusing<br>segments to allow or to prevent the<br>spine from<br>in this particular example we took<br>essentially the gold standard which is<br>essentially a plastic cage which you<br>fill<br>full of bone graft and we were able to<br>show that we could take<br>an optimized or mechanically matched<br>implant<br>and obtain the same amount of<br>the same level of bone fixation the same<br>spine biomechanics<br>as peak plus bone graft but in this case<br>we were only had our<br>patient matched or mechanically matched<br>implant there was no bone graft<br>so again taking bone graft from a<br>patient requires a significant donor<br>morbidity<br>and further problems for the patient so<br>that was a great outcome<br>one of the other outcomes of course is<br>that<br>implants don't always fail they also<br>can become infected so another project<br>we were able to try and work on<br>was around ways of trying to then also<br>prevent infection on titanium implants<br>this is some data also um from um from<br>the national joint registry and also<br>from from professor hooper<br>and i think what i'd just like you to<br>try and focus on is these red bars<br>is that um the reasons for revisions of<br>knee<br>has been increasing particularly if<br>we're looking at deep infections so the<br>red bars<br>reflect deep infection so you think that<br>we would be in control of infection and<br>there's a number of different reasons<br>around it<br>um but again some of the projections or<br>numbers you're trying to look at you<br>know patients with with knee replacement<br>is that um some of the percentages<br>starting to get up again for<br>particularly longer patients in terms of<br>um lifetime risks for for needing a<br>repair to their knee replacement due to<br>infection it's a large problem<br>and it's a significantly costly problem<br>one of the reasons why we might seeing<br>elevated numbers is potentially due to<br>antibiotic resistance again that's one<br>theory and well this is a really nice<br>project we're able to do<br>with colleagues at victoria university<br>at the ferry institute<br>who'd been developing a number of<br>different biofilm inhibitors<br>with the albert einstein college of<br>medicine in the u.s<br>and these referring to these imtans and<br>i won't go into a lot of detail<br>but essentially um these imtan<br>inhibitors are able to interfere<br>with how biofilms form now a biofilm is<br>essentially bacteria that essentially<br>turns into concrete and<br>a key pathway or this quorum sensing<br>within bacteria<br>is that these bacteria can rapidly<br>populate and and form a biofilm which is<br>almost impossible to remove<br>and this is um this is a major cause<br>also for infection<br>so if we're able to apply some<br>technologies where we could interfere<br>with this whole<br>biofilm formation process by using these<br>m-tan inhibitors then that might provide<br>us an alternative pathway<br>to preventing biofilm formation in the<br>very very first place<br>and reducing risks of infection on<br>different types of implants<br>the problem with this or like with a<br>number of different things is how do you<br>get them onto the surface<br>so we've been developing a number of<br>different hydrogels which could<br>incorporate<br>this m10 into this<br>into this material and then release the<br>payload over a period of time<br>we also did some other studies trying to<br>modifying the titanium surface so using<br>a<br>electrochemical process to etch the<br>surface<br>and allow us essentially to provide lots<br>of little nano sized<br>tubes on the surface of the titanium<br>which we could also place our m10 as a<br>way of releasing it so that we had two<br>different types of options<br>and so this was a really nice study we<br>were able to try and show that we could<br>have<br>some ways of getting these m10<br>inhibitors and<br>the work that we're able to try and do<br>was really nice in the fact that we<br>could show that these imtan inhibitors<br>were released they were able to reduce<br>biofilm formation but at the same time<br>they didn't inhibit bone formation which<br>of course what we want<br>so if you'd like if we put bone cells on<br>these same materials and the presence of<br>these<br>biofilm inhibitors we're still able to<br>try and get<br>bone formation so that was a really nice<br>product<br>project we're able to do with with<br>callaghan innovation<br>so a number of different people involved<br>from both otago<br>callahan innovation gary evans<br>and also locally here um steve chambers<br>in terms of being involved in that study<br>so that was really nice<br>multi-disciplinary approach<br>what i'd like to try and finish up uh is<br>really to try and talk about uh some of<br>the latest work that we've tried<br>we've done so as you remember um david<br>mentioned<br>along with my rutherford discovery<br>fellowship it was really influential in<br>terms of me being able to do some really<br>basic science research<br>really start to think well how could we<br>how could we use bioprinting<br>as a way to try and repair different<br>types of tissues and help us undertake<br>some of the fundamental research<br>required<br>as well as then also recruit top<br>students<br>such as kun lim and gabriella lindberg<br>and others<br>onto this work so what i've showed you<br>mostly so far is 3d printing has<br>normally been a hot process where we've<br>had to melt something or other to try<br>and extrude it and you can't put cells<br>in that process<br>cells just don't survive but they do<br>provide you with a nice framework<br>and allow you to work with a degradable<br>say a degradable material<br>a bio ink on the other hand is almost<br>it's a bit like an ink that you would<br>use in your normal printer except it's<br>loaded with cells<br>so this is extrusion bioprinting it's<br>the most popular form of bioprinting<br>involved<br>essentially it works with a hydrogel<br>material and you're able to incorporate<br>cells into the process it's not one of<br>the only<br>materials but one of the biggest<br>challenges that we have in bioprinting<br>is how do you try to do it<br>at a temperature and in a micro<br>environment that's that's friendly to<br>sell so at 37 degrees<br>and also with materials that are<br>non-cytotoxic<br>or what we would call cytocompatible and<br>it's a really complex process and it's<br>really<br>really difficult to achieve one of the<br>really great things about being in this<br>field<br>and also working with um with some of<br>the very first societies that were set<br>up<br>in this case the international society<br>for biofabrication was that because it<br>was a very much an emerging field<br>this field of biofabrication and<br>bioprinting is that we saw an<br>opportunity where<br>we we needed to<br>help help set definitions uh<br>for all the different terminology<br>required because we were rapidly seeing<br>that people were looking at a range of<br>different types of terms<br>and a large number of publications had<br>completely different terms for the same<br>thing<br>so it was really great to be involved in<br>a couple of leading position papers with<br>colleagues<br>within the international society for<br>biofabrication to get consensus<br>opinions on what exactly a bio ink is in<br>terms of<br>um material and also bio fabrication<br>being an automated process which we can<br>combine<br>cells or biological materials<br>as being distinctly different from other<br>different types of<br>biomaterials so for example a<br>so what are some of the different types<br>of materials we try and use again<br>what we're able to do in the group was<br>look at how we would develop different<br>light<br>curing hydrogel buying so it's something<br>i'd like to focus on briefly<br>for a large period of time light had<br>been used to try and polymerize<br>different types of hydrogels so hydrogel<br>is essentially a loose<br>hydrated network and cells are able to<br>migrate within that space and it mimics<br>the normal<br>over a long period of time ultraviolet<br>light had been used as a way<br>to polymerize these different hydrogels<br>so essentially the light would be used<br>to generate radicals and help crosslink<br>um and the reason that we'd like to<br>cross-link these gels as<br>you can see is that gel gelatin<br>essentially we know also from food grade<br>gel<br>um jelly is that actually if you heat it<br>up it becomes liquid and then as you<br>cool it down it sits into a gel so<br>that's a really nice example of what<br>essentially a hydrogel is but as you can<br>see in the video here if our liquid is<br>also 37 degrees the the non-cross-linked<br>hydrogel will just dissolve away and<br>that's not what we really want if we<br>want to print<br>something we want it to remain printed<br>afterwards we don't want it to disappear<br>particularly if it's got all our<br>precious cells in it so you work with<br>different ways of functioning the<br>gelatin so that way you have a cell<br>friendly<br>cytocompatible essentially collagen<br>based<br>network that allows you to<br>print structures and you can have it at<br>37 degrees<br>and it remains or maintains its shape as<br>so we were able to then develop a number<br>visible light photo initiators and then<br>try and demonstrate their capability<br>visible light works at a different<br>wavelength<br>more fate cell friendly wavelength<br>and the particular type of photo<br>initiated i developed was a was a<br>ruthenium metal complex essentially the<br>way it works is that<br>the photo initiator gives off free<br>radicals under stimulation of light<br>and again the really exciting thing<br>using these visible light photo<br>initiators is that it takes this very<br>very small amount of light<br>to generate these radicals which makes<br>it extremely self-friendly and also very<br>friendly if you'd like to use it in<br>surgery<br>compared to other uv and what you really<br>notice here is that<br>um it really makes a difference around<br>cell viability so<br>the green dots are happy alive cells<br>and so we found that we had a really<br>nice alternative to<br>to ways making different hydrogels using<br>gelatin based bindings so as part of all<br>of that work<br>we were able to review that quite<br>recently in terms of<br>all of the different chemistries<br>required and the fundamentals around<br>photo cross linking in in bioprinting<br>using a whole broad range of different<br>types of biofabrication techniques and<br>i'll focus on those a little bit more<br>the main thing was with a big problem in<br>our field is that what you had to do is<br>that for all the different types of<br>bioprinting technologies you had to<br>optimize bio inks for every single<br>technique so each different type of<br>printer and each different type of<br>technique needed different types of<br>properties<br>and it was really hard to control all of<br>the cross-linking kinetics<br>so what did we do well we thought well<br>if we've got this great visible light<br>bio ink well yes we've shown that we can<br>use it for extrusion bioprinting so this<br>is<br>extruding gelatin based bioink<br>containing cells and we can get<br>excellent maintenance of shape fidelity<br>so<br>the shape that we want to design is then<br>the exact shape that we print afterwards<br>but there's other different types of bio<br>printing technologies called lithography<br>and they also use light<br>not uv but with you with light and so<br>we're actually able to use the visible<br>light photo initiator systems to develop<br>these<br>solid compatible resins so this is<br>another way of using light to project<br>the same type of projector that's<br>actually projecting on the screen here<br>is the same type of principle where you<br>can get layer by layer projections onto<br>a onto a liquid resin<br>and so able to cross-link these<br>hydrogels just where the light shows<br>and you can get really high resolutions<br>with these particular types of<br>lithography based<br>technologies so around about 25 microns<br>whereas it's much much<br>higher with other extrusion bioprinting<br>so the types of features and structures<br>you can try and make are really exciting<br>at the best bit is of course so you can<br>try and incorporate cells into that<br>process<br>but one of the next challenges was is<br>even though we had this visible like<br>photo initiator<br>um it didn't necessarily we we needed<br>different types of hydrogels you would<br>have seen on the previous slide we<br>worked with gelatin<br>the lithography was done with a<br>synthetic polymer um pva<br>no one at that time had actually<br>developed a bio ink that could be used<br>across multiple different platforms it<br>was really slowing everyone's research<br>down<br>this is a really great collaboration we<br>had with the university of wurzburg<br>and jurgen gross group and we did a huge<br>amount of characterization on these<br>um on these different types of of<br>hydrogels that were formed using<br>clip chemistry and so it's a different<br>type of chemistry<br>which is much more homogeneous and<br>allows you much more control and<br>tunability over the types of properties<br>that you get<br>so this was based on elevated gelatin<br>in the presence of then different<br>unstylated photocross linkers<br>we made what we call this gel age<br>hydrogel<br>and when we're looking at all the<br>different properties if you took this<br>gel age hydrogel<br>and it was at four degrees um what it<br>was was quite thick and gooey and made<br>it really<br>really great um exactly the right<br>rheological properties for extrusion by<br>printing so you can see we could<br>successfully extrude this gel age bio<br>ink there<br>but what you can also see from this<br>profile is that if it more to room<br>temperature which is what all the<br>different lithography<br>machines run at it actually has all the<br>right properties as a bioresin<br>and so we were able to use um one<br>particular type of bio ink but then<br>across multiple different types of<br>bio fabrication technologies and that<br>that made it essentially a platform bio<br>ink<br>so this was again a really nice paper<br>and one of the first examples where we<br>could try and show<br>that we had really clever chemistry and<br>the properties of the different types of<br>materials were able to<br>fabricate were cytocompatible but gave<br>us an<br>option to try and use one particular<br>type of material across a range of<br>different types of fabrication<br>techniques<br>but those materials weren't necessarily<br>able to form all the different types of<br>tissues that we<br>really like so we are obviously really<br>fascinated in reconstructing<br>the osteochondral zone or the<br>osteochondral tissue so this is<br>cartilage in bone and vascular tissues<br>so how can we orchestrate that cell<br>function i was talking about at the<br>beginning of my lecture<br>one of the questions we had was can we<br>make bioinks that are cell instructive<br>for cartilage so we've shown that we can<br>extrude them we can show that we can use<br>lithography but can<br>can we make them now to make a specific<br>tissue so this was work done where we<br>tried to<br>further functionalize this gelatin with<br>um with heparin<br>now you just need to know that<br>essentially heparin we were using as a<br>surrogate essentially as a<br>as a way to bind some certain different<br>types of growth factors so<br>heparin is known to try and help um bind<br>growth factors and stimulate cartilage<br>formation so this is one of our gels<br>that's made with<br>in this case a phthalated heparin if<br>there's no heparin<br>then i hope you can see the difference<br>of this beautiful red tissue is all<br>cartilage type tissue<br>and so we're able to try and show that<br>we could have this cell instructive<br>capability to<br>these different types of hydrogels we're<br>able to make next question was can we<br>make bio inks that are selling structure<br>for bone<br>in this case we're trying to work with<br>different types of nanoparticles<br>so these were nanoparticles which we had<br>synthesized in the lab<br>these were strontium so strontium some<br>of you may be familiar<br>strontium renault it's also been used in<br>modifying or enhancing bone density<br>but strontium is able to substitute into<br>the mineral component of bone and we<br>made<br>strontium-laden hydrogel bite ink<br>not only did it help us with the<br>rheology to allow us to get<br>much more intricate prints and shape<br>fidelity but if you place then<br>human mesenchymal stromal cells from<br>bone marrow<br>into these hydrogels with strontium then<br>the cells get all the right signals to<br>start forming<br>and we're able to do that with other<br>different types of<br>nanoparticles um in this case also with<br>lap night<br>next question was can we make bio inks<br>that are selling structure for vascular<br>tissues<br>this is one really important one because<br>we'd actually like to be able to create<br>hydrogels that are able to form all<br>these different types of tissues and so<br>far<br>when we all the different types of bio<br>inks i've been able to show you<br>were relatively stiff in terms of what a<br>cell would feel<br>because we'd like these particular<br>structures to have<br>um to have an inherent properties once<br>they're finally printed<br>so the real problem with vascular tissue<br>engineering is how can you print<br>something or other that's really really<br>soft<br>that vascular cells would really like to<br>start growing in formula<br>form vascular networks in but they're<br>still able to be printable<br>and while um the answer turned out to be<br>some of those different types of gel age<br>materials and then also with<br>collaborators we're able to make a range<br>of other different types of<br>pig-based materials and when you<br>incorporate<br>endothelial cells so in this case<br>endothelial progenitor cells and also<br>mesenchymal stromal cells to help mature<br>that vascular network we can start to<br>get really nice vessel-like structures<br>forming<br>in these soft hydrogels that can still<br>so what we're able to do is while we<br>were able to package some of that up<br>and through otago innovation we've been<br>able to commercialize some of those<br>technologies this is an example of the<br>different photo initiator unit<br>um that has been picked up by a us<br>company advanced biomatrix and they make<br>a range of different types of products<br>for for bioprinting so it's quite cool<br>that some of the different technology<br>being developed you know through in the<br>crack group<br>is now being sold and other other labs<br>and other scientists around the world<br>can also try and use the cool materials<br>that we've been working on might<br>remember before i said um with 3d<br>printing uh<br>it's really fantastic technology to<br>allow you to<br>embrace a complexity and so<br>what are the a lot of what i've shown<br>you so far<br>is what we recall in terms of the the<br>process of manufacturing has been kind<br>of top down and the fact that you start<br>out<br>with cells and then you try to put them<br>into a scaffold<br>but in engineering there's lots of other<br>different ways of actually making really<br>complex structures and you talk and<br>you work from a more bottom-up or<br>modular assembly and<br>i guess one example in terms of<br>engineering processes in terms of<br>complex systems and taking a bottom-up<br>or modular approach<br>for example might be around the<br>manufacture of a of an aircraft<br>you don't have one person that would<br>manufacture every single part of the<br>aircraft you would have<br>lots of different work groups working on<br>different modules from the fuselage to<br>the undercarriage<br>to then wing components and all of those<br>things and so<br>we got fascinated in ways where we could<br>actually look at seeing if we couldn't<br>make lots of different types of modules<br>so this was another part of our research<br>where<br>we thought right was there some way that<br>we can make an automated process for<br>generating hundreds and hundreds or<br>thousands and thousands of little tissue<br>modules little like almost like little<br>lego building blocks and then have an<br>automated bio fabrication or 3d<br>bioprinting process<br>which assembled those all together so<br>looking at a much bigger scale um<br>in terms of making vascular tissues bone<br>tissues and cartilage tissues<br>can we take lots of different modules of<br>all of those since we've shown that we<br>can actually make bio inks for each of<br>those tissues<br>can we now start to put them together<br>and can we put them together in a way<br>that we might be able to then integrate<br>them into you know surgeries of the<br>future<br>so um the initial work here again if you<br>can imagine in surgery if you've got a<br>large defect to the knee<br>you're able to try and image that using<br>techniques i mentioned previously<br>then you could try and send that<br>information to your 3d bio printer in<br>in surgery or adjacent to surgery at the<br>same time what we did<br>in this work is that we we developed<br>different ways of generating hundreds of<br>tissue modules so we used a 96 well<br>plate format<br>to generate for example lots of little<br>tissue modules that could be cartilage<br>tissue or bone for example<br>and then we also had a microfluidic<br>system which you'll see a little bit<br>later which was also just to take<br>the same hydrogels and encapsulate cells<br>into the little beads and form hundreds<br>of little<br>cell encapsulated beads but if you had<br>ways of making these modules<br>and then we had different ways of<br>arranging each of the different modules<br>we might be able to print a construct<br>that was stable that would allow us to<br>start to assemble each of these<br>different types of modules so this is<br>our vascular bio ink going in<br>the flash of blue is essentially the<br>light that we would use to cross link<br>all of this together to keep it all in<br>place<br>and then these could potentially be<br>osteogenic modules that are placed<br>into the structure once they were placed<br>then you could try and take<br>cartilage modules that are then placed<br>within this<br>structure and it would be designed to<br>have the same mechanical properties<br>as either then cartilage or bone<br>so that was essentially a bioassembly<br>approach that we that we tried to<br>develop and this is essentially<br>the the work that i just showed you so<br>we're able to create<br>a stable degradable polymer scaffold so<br>this has the same<br>compressive properties as native<br>cartilage<br>and we're able to then incorporate<br>different modules in it to then try and<br>see if we can create<br>different cartilage as well as the<br>vascularized bone regions<br>so this was quite exciting and that was<br>a really nice part of work<br>one of the really exciting things or<br>fascinating things i i find about this<br>work is that we can also work across<br>across disciplines so we've done a lot<br>of work also<br>in um in the veterinary space<br>obviously um preclinical models is clear<br>but obviously we have a large number of<br>veterinary patients not just human<br>patients we're trying to develop<br>technologies for<br>um so in this case um we've been working<br>with wayne mcelroth who's actually an<br>ex-kiwi based in the u.s<br>keyhole surgery in horses<br>and allison aldrich who's actually also<br>a veterinary surgeon and<br>a phd within our group and we're trying<br>to look at ways that we can now take<br>this modular assembly approach and apply<br>it in these preclinical models as a way<br>to test<br>so what else can we do with these little<br>modules of tissue so the more we do with<br>it the more excited we get because we go<br>what if we could do this and what if we<br>could do that so i've mentioned before<br>that we can make these little modules of<br>cells<br>and they can form cartilage we can<br>encapsulate those cells in these<br>hydrogels<br>like i mentioned before and also form<br>cartilage and then there's other types<br>of<br>strategies where we can form cell<br>instructive<br>hydrogels using decelerized matrix so we<br>can take different types of<br>existing tissues decelerate them<br>essentially they've got all the nice<br>goodies in them<br>that will still allow us to form<br>different types of tissues<br>we can work with different types of<br>cells i talked to you a little bit about<br>stem cells but another thing that we're<br>really<br>excited about is to try and look at ways<br>of using not just<br>stromal cells from bone marrow but<br>stromal cells derived from<br>umbilical cord blood and these might<br>provide an analog genetic<br>source so these are essentially a donor<br>type source that we can use more off the<br>shelf<br>this is one of the big problems in<br>cartilage engineering is that where do<br>we get ourselves from and wouldn't it be<br>really great if we had a way of<br>being able to take cells from a donor<br>and have them pre-prepared at the time<br>of surgery<br>rather than having to culture the<br>in terms of other different types of<br>materials we're interested in so we've<br>developed some different types of<br>hydrogels based on vitreous humor<br>which actually has a lot of similar<br>extracellular matrix components to<br>articular cartilage and is really<br>interesting<br>material that we can try and encapsulate<br>to try and develop these different types<br>of modules<br>but what does this all mean for<br>translational medicine or potentially<br>personalized medicine<br>um well in in normal medicine<br>we have a concept we can apply it<br>in a pre-clinical study but it's often<br>based on a<br>blanket population of patients<br>the promise of personalized medicine<br>means that we can try and look at other<br>ways<br>of of looking at high throughput<br>screening or screening in vitro models<br>um without the need necessarily for<br>pre-clinical studies but then are<br>tailored specifically to the patient so<br>it could be tailored<br>um around gender can be based around age<br>can be based around<br>ethnicity and a broad range of other<br>different types of things and that's<br>really the medicine we really want to be<br>doing because<br>if we're going to design a drug to work<br>then we want to know it's going to work<br>on this particular patient of that<br>particular age<br>and i think some of the different tools<br>and<br>strategies that are being developed um<br>really lend to this and it's something<br>rather we've tried to focus on a little<br>bit more<br>so again if we can form hundreds of<br>these little tissue modules<br>can we do that from selected patients<br>again can we make that patient specific<br>we can then study lots of different<br>types of cues about how those patients<br>cells perform in a three-dimensional<br>micro-environment so you've got to<br>remember<br>cancer is three-dimensional tumors are<br>three-dimensional<br>all our tissues are three-dimensional<br>and so we need to be able to study them<br>and that goes also then for for scanning<br>how we do these drugs and also looking<br>at maybe potentially drugs for modifying<br>osteoarthritis or treating<br>osteoarthritis<br>so i guess in terms of summarizing those<br>last few slides we can make personalized<br>implants for patients we can also look<br>at<br>mechanistic capabilities around organ<br>growth and development<br>and also try to look at high throughput<br>ways of of studying or looking at<br>disease modelling and drug development<br>and all of these can then be either<br>clinically relevant or can be<br>used in a lab-based setting<br>i won't go into any more detail um but<br>what we've been able to do is develop a<br>number of different uh well-placed<br>role plate based technologies for for<br>screening or trying to move this along<br>um it was some work that we're able to<br>do in terms of trying to generate sort<br>of a lab on a chip or essentially a lab<br>on a plate<br>so these 96 well plates we can then look<br>at 3d printing into<br>these well plates we've designed<br>essentially a 3d printer themselves and<br>allow us to be able to provide perfusion<br>and a number of different types of cues<br>so the idea is you can<br>start to take a hundred patient hundreds<br>of patient samples<br>place them and then hundreds of<br>individual micro wells and expose them<br>to a range of different types of drugs<br>and multiplex the whole system and<br>that's really where we saw the future<br>going with some of the research that we<br>were doing<br>in terms of being able to create or look<br>at using bioprinting to make really<br>complex in vitro models but not just<br>making one of them but making hundreds<br>and hundreds and thousands and thousands<br>of them<br>are combined with these different<br>so this all sounds fantastic and i just<br>want to<br>mention a couple of final things uh<br>around um<br>you know a bit of a sanity check for<br>everyone here in the room<br>um and those watching in terms of what's<br>realistically possible<br>you know with the 3d of future 3d<br>bioprinting it sounds like almost<br>anything is possible but<br>you know are we promising more than we<br>exposed to a number of different<br>questions for a number of times in terms<br>of<br>um is the hype really warranted so<br>there's obviously a number of<br>misconceptions about what 3d<br>printing can really do we won't be 3d<br>printing<br>heart replacements next week yes there's<br>a number of different<br>3d printing technologies around organ<br>development but there are<br>a number of decades off nonetheless<br>there's some very<br>exciting developments that are being<br>made and i guess what i want to try and<br>explain it's just like um<br>i guess galileo with you know with his<br>microscope was able to make amazing<br>discoveries<br>you know we look at crispr cast<br>technology now just a new tool that<br>allows you to make the most amazing<br>discoveries around gene editing<br>and i think bioprinting is in that space<br>as well as it's really a tool it's not<br>really a solution it's not that if we<br>can buy print something we'll magically<br>fix everyone's lives<br>but it's amazing tool to do some really<br>cool research but also really<br>translational research<br>i think that's really important to try<br>and get across to the next generation so<br>we've been really lucky to develop a<br>number<br>or run a number of different courses<br>here in bioprinting and also within the<br>masters and bioengineering program<br>to try and genera um train not just<br>you know young bioengineers um and also<br>on biochemists<br>but also also clinicians in the art<br>um 3d printing doesn't have to be just<br>research and<br>i i really wanted to put this in because<br>um it's something rather we've been<br>developing or discussing just within me<br>the<br>our indigenous health institute here at<br>university of otago christchurch<br>and um we've got a number of different<br>which is around respect it's one of five<br>different values that we have<br>within and that we try to behold within<br>within our group<br>within our um within our campus and<br>if we can also look at 3d printing these<br>then we can use this as a way around<br>health literacy and trying to use 3d<br>printing as a way of communicating<br>ideas and in one way by by being able to<br>3d print so this is actually using the<br>hydrogels i've been explaining<br>is that we can literally transpose some<br>of the beliefs and values of our<br>of our other of our campus<br>you know into the research that we do<br>and this is this is essentially<br>literal evidence of us of us attempting<br>to do that<br>and we can also you know bring those<br>different values to life by<br>incorporating cells into part of that<br>and i think<br>you know there's a lot of different<br>things that we can do with with 3d<br>printing other than just<br>a couple of very final points um i um<br>i have this i'm into the outdoors quite<br>a lot and i really<br>love this um quote from gary ball and i<br>think it's really poignant at this<br>particular time<br>um i really associated with this quote<br>because he talks about his heroes<br>and i never really think of academics<br>and scientists as heroes but i think<br>you look at what's happened recently<br>with covert and the response within new<br>zealand<br>around yeah i guess people being excited<br>about science and also communicating<br>science<br>but i really like this quote because um<br>you know these these<br>were things um that uh<br>that was exciting and again some of the<br>skills you know<br>weren't necessarily understand um but<br>they hadn't really forgotten about that<br>you know that joy of discovery<br>um so i think it was a really a really<br>interesting quote that i liked to come<br>which means with your food basket in my<br>food basket will prosper and i also am a<br>strong believer in sort of<br>erasing all of these different dividing<br>lines and and really making connections<br>within research<br>um if we all collectively bring our<br>bastards together<br>then i think you know we can um<br>you know we can share our experiences<br>across multiple fields and multiple<br>perspectives<br>and and you know by working together i<br>think we can all prosper<br>um and you know that whole network can<br>grow so i really like our research<br>and the fact that it's trying to connect<br>all of these really complex dots across<br>a really broad range of different<br>areas and i think science is really<br>going in that direction and i think<br>again covert<br>response in terms of all the different<br>experts that are providing<br>feedback into that and having a robust<br>discussion and<br>i um i have a huge number of<br>acknowledgements and i i really just<br>want to have them here<br>to to acknowledge all of our<br>international partners there's a large<br>number in new zealand but i really would<br>like to acknowledge<br>all of the fantastic international<br>collaborators we've had<br>part of the funding has also been from<br>from the eu so we had a really<br>exciting skelegen program which was an<br>eu funded program between new zealand<br>and europe<br>so i'd like to thank all of our<br>different skelgen partners<br>we had a nz korea targeted funding<br>through mb<br>which was really exciting and i've<br>mentioned also again a lot of the really<br>great work that we've<br>also done around pre-clinical models<br>with the fantastic group at colorado<br>state university<br>it's a huge thanks to all of the the<br>funders are specifically the royal<br>society of new zealand and my rather for<br>discovery fellowship which really<br>kick-started a lot of this work<br>um and huge thanks also then to mb and<br>hrc<br>and a large number of other funders<br>which have really helped make this<br>research happen<br>also within the different centres of<br>research excellence around new zealand<br>and i'd like to also personally<br>acknowledge the australasian society for<br>biomaterials and tissue engineering<br>fabulous mentorship and a really<br>excellent bunch of<br>researchers and it's i've really valued<br>all of the input that i've had<br>um obviously none of this work you know<br>i haven't done hardly any of this work<br>actually the thing is around<br>i know it sounds funny but i mean it<br>really takes a team to do all of this<br>work<br>and i'd like to thank all of our current<br>uh current creat members<br>um and all of our alumni it's a really<br>fantastic bunch<br>i'd really also like to acknowledge um<br>both alistair rothwell and gary for um<br>having faith in me when i when i first<br>arrived back from overseas<br>and also our collaborators on the<br>dunedin campus and both<br>in dentistry and also locally here in<br>the mackenzie cancer group<br>as well as numerous others um you know<br>showing up at work and working with all<br>these fabulous<br>creators as we're called you know<br>really makes my day and<br>and yeah i think it's really exciting uh<br>to see all the different developments um<br>and have such a really strong team um<br>normally at that point we would well<br>it's customary that everyone<br>claps and has has an applause but i<br>would like to do things a little bit<br>differently i would like to<br>not receive applause just yet what i'd<br>like to do because well the whole point<br>of this evening is all about me<br>anyway was to ask one request that you<br>thank you so there's two reasons this<br>first one well you've been sitting down<br>for about an hour and it's for really<br>good joint health that you actually<br>stand up and i don't want my my ipl to<br>be a cause of any any knee<br>uh knee damage or um<br>or pain so thank you very much<br>but um i would i would really like to<br>thank some some keep some key people and<br>again these are people that don't get<br>applause when we go to conferences or<br>before concord when we used to go to<br>conferences<br>but there's people in my department um<br>admin staff and everyone<br>um you know all of the creators and<br>other things that don't get any applause<br>and i think today is just a really a<br>fantastic opportunity to<br>to get a big standing ovation for those<br>people who mean<br>a huge amount to me and that that's<br>amanda vesper and tasman<br>and also my family and all my friends<br>good evening for those who don't know me<br>my name is gary hooper and i'm<br>the head of department orthopedic<br>surgery in musculus musculoskeletal<br>medicine<br>i'm not tim's boss i'm his colleague and<br>wow tim that ladies and gentlemen<br>is why he's now a research professor<br>congratulations<br>in honor of the occasion i decide to<br>wear the regalia<br>of the australasian college of surgeons<br>just it's fitting because of your<br>association<br>with the new zealand orthopedic<br>association obviously from his research<br>a lot of is directed towards orthopedic<br>implants and orthopedic procedures the<br>orthopedic association<br>is a fairly tight community and it'd be<br>fair to say<br>it's a closed community you don't get<br>access to their meetings you don't get<br>access<br>to their membership unless you are a<br>member of the orthopedic association<br>generally that means you have to be an<br>orthopedic surgeon<br>tim was a member of our orthopedic<br>association<br>and has been for some several years and<br>that's a recognition<br>of the amount of work he has done for<br>so i believe in tim i believe in what<br>he's doing<br>in 10 15 20 years<br>maybe we'll get new articular cartilage<br>that will have two serious sequelae<br>one we won't need any orthopedic<br>surgeons<br>and number two he'll be just dismissed<br>tim what a fantastic lecture but a<br>fantastic<br>early start to your research career<br>because you're still young you've got a<br>long way to go<br>and we really do look forward to the<br>development<br>in the future<br>lecture is his ackermann ipl<br>the inaugural professorial lecture<br>tim came along and thought ipl that<br>means i'm a professor now that means i<br>get some more money<br>true you get a little bit increase in<br>wage but not nearly as much if you went<br>to that other ipl<br>auction and got five million rupees or<br>whatever<br>anyway thank you tim thanks very much<br>for your contribution it was an<br>kia ora tenetato tour my name is
