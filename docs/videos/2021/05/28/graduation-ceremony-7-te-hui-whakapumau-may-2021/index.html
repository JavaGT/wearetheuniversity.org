by the governor general<br>at his marae<br>utah welcome<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>uh<br>i watched carefully as the student<br>graduates graduates<br>were called to come up<br>because you weren't quite sure whether<br>some of you had so much whakapapa it<br>took the entire walk from there to here<br>some of you got big cheers and i thought<br>well they must be popular<br>then i thought uh probably not it's just<br>their parents whanau and mates are<br>relieved<br>a really important time<br>as we confront as a world and as a<br>country<br>some of the greatest challenges our<br>species<br>has ever confronted whether we'll<br>survive<br>whether we can finally shrug off<br>the hangover of colonization<br>and find a different way<br>a way that marries west and pacific<br>that tracks a path that no one's ever<br>so many other things that i'm not going<br>to list them because i'll forget<br>something<br>you came to a university which i guess<br>was called victoria when you arrived<br>and that kind of underscores that<br>colonization story i mean it is victoria<br>she was the other side of the treaty in<br>1840<br>and of course we dress up like this<br>i got an honorary doctorate from tawa<br>which is why interestingly it's a tribal<br>one<br>and all of those people look like my<br>courtiers<br>to remind us there are some valuable<br>things we inherited from that place<br>some approaches to knowledge systems of<br>that are going to be quite useful to us<br>to you and<br>your grandchildren in the future<br>when i came through this place that was<br>all we got<br>we sang guardia almost something or<br>other<br>nothing<br>i was thinking to myself as i was<br>watching this process go on what's<br>changed<br>in the yes 35 years since i came through<br>this place<br>you know what i noticed the<br>way in the room the mataura<br>the number of kahu huruhuru<br>hieke<br>i expect they're right victoria's<br>probably no longer<br>a good name for this place it's missing<br>something important<br>i must say i do mourn for the numbers of<br>chickens and pheasants<br>that have given up their lives for this<br>graduation ceremony<br>but we are at the fulcrum point of<br>change and you represent it<br>not just in what you've studied and in<br>the fact that you've chosen the maori<br>graduation<br>in what you wear in the way you present<br>yourselves<br>in the way your wha know your hapu and<br>your eewee get up<br>and do pike here once too often<br>how can new zealanders of any stripe<br>not feel pride and belonging<br>in watching this process go on<br>because you know when i was your age<br>you could be forgiven for believing<br>that all terroir was floating somewhere<br>in the mid-atlantic<br>when i was a child we had to stand up at<br>the movies<br>because the first thing that happened<br>that is a world you people can't<br>possibly imagine<br>but it was just yesterday it was just<br>yesterday<br>i think we are on<br>the most important journey we will ever<br>be on<br>as a country we are heading south<br>from the atlantic to the pacific at last<br>and we are coming to discover that we<br>are a polynesian country<br>and we are polynesians<br>and that will save us<br>from the hangover of the last 200 years<br>and it'll set us in a strong position<br>for these existential challenges that we<br>will face<br>i know this to be true because the rest<br>of the world is looking at us<br>little old al te arua for answers<br>with the ability as we keep challenging<br>ourselves to do<br>to synthesize and blend the west<br>and the pacific to find new ways of<br>thinking<br>new ways of doing new ways of being<br>if we can do that here<br>have no doubt the world will follow<br>you see the graduation that i went to<br>was siloed<br>you got your ba's then your bscs<br>then your bcas and<br>your llbs often on different nights<br>because the genius of western knowledge<br>is to silo<br>to fragment to break down and to analyze<br>every tiny little part<br>so that universities became places where<br>you<br>got to know more and more about less and<br>less<br>the journey this university is on<br>is to reverse that<br>to break down walls and to talk about as<br>we heard from the<br>ecosystem science and ecosystem tikanga<br>the blending of those two things<br>produces answers<br>that are superior to the separating<br>and fragmenting of those two things in<br>accordance with<br>the approach of western science now what<br>i<br>i don't for a moment wish to set aside<br>western science<br>it can be incredibly helpful<br>but there has always been a layer<br>missing<br>and you all of you are<br>weaving that layer back in<br>that's your contribution<br>to al te roa and to the planet<br>and i'm sorry we lay this burden on you<br>i'm very sorry we've had to lay this<br>burden on you<br>but having watched you graduate and<br>having seen the support of your whanau<br>yohapu and your<br>having seen how much your staff are<br>proud of what you've done<br>i couldn't possibly be more confident<br>i couldn't be more confident so<br>who would have thought the um someone<br>said that the heading<br>marae was opened in 1986<br>not true the here was opened in 1980<br>it was the old chaplaincy building and<br>we chucked some carvings up on it<br>and called it a maori space that was the<br>beginning once<br>that was done the ambition grew and grew<br>and grew<br>1986 the new foreign was built<br>2023 we have the living power<br>hopefully and the living power is the<br>very embodiment of this idea that i was<br>talking about<br>a par a maori space<br>not just for the maoris but for the<br>lawyers<br>the scientists the doctors the<br>architects the engineers<br>all to come and learn and draw from the<br>wisdom of tao maori<br>where silos are broken down because a<br>culture<br>that believes in phenomena to its very<br>core<br>hates division and loves<br>only connection the living power<br>is kind of a culmination of the ideas<br>you guys have been working on<br>and it i believe maybe i'm not objective<br>because this is my university<br>because ironically interestingly<br>surprisingly the breaking down of silos<br>walls and barriers is a revolutionary<br>idea in western knowledge<br>even if it's as old as kupe in tigana<br>maori<br>so the decolonization story starts<br>when we go like this<br>and make stronger<br>what was not as strong separately<br>oh<br>foreign<br>now it's the tradition at this<br>university that the last of the formal<br>speeches<br>the address given on behalf of all the<br>graduates<br>is delivered by a student who has stood<br>out<br>in their time at the heritage<br>university of wellington by exemplifying<br>the qualities we<br>seek to instill in our graduates<br>and so today's address will be given by<br>riana tengahui<br>rihanna has graduated today with a<br>bachelor of arts majoring in maori<br>studies<br>and a bachelor of laws lyanna is<br>currently working at a commercial law<br>firm<br>and continuing her tereo maori study at<br>tewananga or aotearoa<br>i wrote my speech a couple weeks ago and<br>then i found out that i was going after<br>the<br>sir doctor the honourable justice joe<br>williams so<br>i would like to acknowledge all the<br>whanau members and friends that have<br>traveled to be here today to celebrate<br>our graduates<br>your support has been a massive factor<br>in the success of the graduate in your<br>whanau<br>whether the support looked like<br>financial support care packages<br>having a quality cooked meal at home in<br>the breaks or just being on the other<br>end of the phone when things got a bit<br>overwhelming or stressful<br>thank you i would like to specifically<br>acknowledge my nan<br>she's the only of my four grandparents<br>still here with me today so it's really<br>special to me that she came all the way<br>from<br>foyer country in little old partier i<br>always promised her that when she made<br>it down here i'd take her to the club so<br>that's what we're up to tonight<br>i would like to acknowledge all of the<br>important people to us who weren't able<br>to be here today<br>but without a doubt they're here with us<br>today<br>congratulations you should be incredibly<br>proud of yourself all of your whanau and<br>your ewe and your tipuna proud of you<br>um<br>there's two key lessons that i've<br>learned here that i'd like to share<br>and they're linked to the two highlights<br>of my experience at university<br>the context of my first is that when i<br>started university i was incredibly shy<br>particularly in my tedious classes and i<br>sat silent in class for the majority of<br>my first two and a half years<br>i dreaded being asked a question or<br>having to do group work or anything like<br>that<br>just out of fear and shame of having to<br>speak my classmates were supportive and<br>help me understand instructions but i<br>felt like i wasn't really making any<br>progress<br>and constantly felt inadequate my<br>highlight is the first time that i<br>voluntarily answered a question in class<br>it was my third year and it was in dr<br>cardina kelly's class<br>and i remember it being one of the first<br>times i felt like i was kind of<br>following what was going on in class<br>i can't remember the question but i<br>waited and waited for somebody to answer<br>and no one did<br>so i tentatively put my hand up ready to<br>snatch it back down<br>i answered the class in cardinal with a<br>little or possibly a lot of mask<br>disbelief<br>went up and<br>at that moment the whole class started<br>clapping for me probably out of shock<br>my language is my awakening my language<br>is the window to my soul<br>as i said at the beginning of my speech<br>interior i sat inside of our farinui on<br>the brink of tears<br>countless times during the start of my<br>deal journey and it was difficult and it<br>felt endless<br>and i was ashamed and just wanted to<br>stop turning up<br>but that's what unpacking<br>intergenerational whakama looks like<br>and it's never going to be easy but it's<br>always going to be worth it<br>so to my fellow graduates those who<br>haven't found the right way to delve<br>into te reo yet<br>um find it it is the wahara to tell<br>maori and if i could get past the deep<br>inherent shame<br>then you can as well my second highlight<br>is my moot interior<br>a moot is essentially a mock trial<br>competition and you have to defend or<br>prosecute a case in front of a panel of<br>judges including justice joan that year<br>i regretted signing up to the<br>competition in te reo every moment up<br>until it was over<br>and then justice joe started grilling me<br>on my legal arguments i was like<br>um but it's now one of my proudest<br>it was also the first time that my dad<br>had seen me speak to<br>he's now deep into his own tedious<br>journey and i couldn't be prouder<br>so my second takeaway is tu fatia te<br>which essentially means feel the fear<br>and do it anyway<br>i think that this ties in well with<br>where we're all heading in our careers<br>we've been privileged enough to get a<br>tertiary education which opens a lot of<br>doorways into different spaces for us<br>lots of these spaces have had maori and<br>pakia academics<br>at pacifica sorry also fighting for<br>recognition for a long time<br>from what i've seen it feels like a lot<br>of these industries are now realizing<br>that we as maori<br>and pacifica have an entirely different<br>skill set and world view<br>on top of being successful in a<br>mainstream institution such as this one<br>and that this is extremely valuable we<br>have the maori health authority the<br>beginning of the fusing of tikanga maori<br>and the common law<br>maori values becoming a focal point in<br>resource management<br>maori mps backing the colonial status<br>quo and<br>winning and just across the board a real<br>recognition of the value of our systems<br>i'm not sure if it's just me but that<br>feels kind of scary to me that these<br>champions of te al maori have been<br>fighting<br>and creating these solutions for us for<br>so long and we're entering our careers<br>at a time<br>where great possibly flawless<br>implementation and execution is<br>necessary<br>but even though it may be daunting to<br>fits<br>because it's never going to be easy but<br>it's always going to be worth it and so<br>much of the hard part has already been<br>done<br>so to my fellow graduates be proud of<br>how hard you've worked to get to this<br>position<br>recognize and appreciate the multiple<br>skill sets that you have<br>celebrate your achievements and<br>celebrate those people who are your po<br>po furinaki or pillars of support<br>throughout these years<br>hmm<br>bye<br>oh<br>oh<br>hey<br>oh<br>oh<br>my<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>oh<br>thank you for sharing your personal<br>journey from that<br>shy student that didn't want to speak to<br>standing
