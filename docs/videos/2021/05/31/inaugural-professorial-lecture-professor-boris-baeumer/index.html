Collaborating with a research group at the Desert Research Institute in Nevada, he is exploring better ways to forecast how particles move in groundwater; collaborating with researchers in Germany and Hungary he is developing the theory that allows for a deeper understanding of non-local differential equations and their connection to stochastic processes.<br><br><br>This Marsden funded research is aiming to ultimately provide better models for scientists to make more accurate forecasts in systems where rare extreme events are driving the system; whether they are fast underground pathways in groundwater, weather events driving erosion or seed dispersal, or distant travel spreading a virus. Boris’ research also includes finding efficient numerical algorithms to approximate the solutions of the derived systems of non-local or fractional differential equations.<br><br><br><br>This lecture

cragg<br>and i'm the acting deputy vice<br>chancellor academic<br>here at the university of otago it gives<br>me great pleasure to open this<br>inaugural professorial lecture for<br>professor boris<br>boymer on behalf of the university i<br>would like to begin<br>by extending a particularly warm welcome<br>to the members of boris's family<br>and they're here with us this evening<br>his wife francis<br>son albert studying maths and physics at<br>otago<br>and daughters leilana and sylvia<br>and just as importantly his father and<br>mother<br>are live streaming from germany assuming<br>the connections have worked<br>and we've also got boris's phd advisor<br>professor frank nubranda from louisiana<br>and what he calls his phd grandfather<br>professor nagal from sorry pronunciation<br>awful<br>and we believe that there are a number<br>of friends and family members<br>in the usa germany and australia<br>who may or may not be watching so if<br>you're watching<br>very welcome to you too it's really<br>wonderful that<br>all these people can be here physically<br>or by live streaming because the<br>presence of family and friends<br>is a clear signal of the importance of<br>such an occasion<br>and i'd also like to acknowledge and<br>welcome<br>staff and students from the host<br>department the department of mathematics<br>and statistics<br>and from across the university as well<br>as members of the wider<br>dunedin community and i'd like to give a<br>special<br>welcome to our chancellor dr royden<br>somerville who attends many many<br>of these inaugural professorial these<br>ipls<br>are always a time of celebration and<br>pride<br>for the university of otago and so i'm<br>delighted to see<br>i really feel full auditorium<br>because this means so many people are<br>here to mark this important milestone<br>in boris's career<br>to be promoted to professor at the<br>university<br>of otago is not an automatic journey<br>through the academic ranks it requires<br>the candidate<br>to show sustained outstanding leadership<br>in at least two of teaching research and<br>service<br>and then at least sustained outstanding<br>competence in the third applications for<br>professorship<br>go through three committees a divisional<br>committee<br>a staffing advisory committee and then<br>the vice chancellor's advisory committee<br>and the opinions are also sought of<br>external and international referees in<br>terms of<br>research as i hope you're going to learn<br>this evening<br>professor bauma is a passionate and<br>caring<br>teacher across all levels of teaching<br>from 100 through to 400 level<br>and for his postgraduate research<br>students<br>his mantra and i'm now quoting from his<br>application for professorship<br>is mathematics is full of threshold<br>concepts<br>ideas that you will never forget once<br>you understand them<br>and he also believes that once a student<br>can explain<br>a concept to a fellow student they<br>achieve<br>deep understanding and the phrase i<br>really liked<br>was leading students in this individual<br>journal of<br>journey of discovery is at the heart of<br>his teaching<br>in recent times with the support of two<br>calt grants<br>he has led and is leading a pan<br>university team<br>to develop a robust tool for assessing<br>competency in numeracy in<br>all of our first year students no matter<br>what qualification<br>they are enrolled in and he's also<br>working on how to support<br>those students with low numeracy ability<br>he's also a successful and given the<br>discipline<br>a well-funded researcher and a leading<br>figure<br>in his field of expertise his research<br>career has been marked by many successes<br>which i'm sure you'll learn about during<br>his lecture<br>entitled the power of the limit of a<br>power<br>and throughout his career he's also<br>provided<br>outstanding service to his discipline<br>his academic department<br>and within new zealand more broadly last<br>but certainly not least boris is an<br>extremely collegial member of<br>his academic department and the entire<br>academic community<br>so boris on behalf of the university of<br>otago<br>it gives me great pleasure to<br>congratulate you<br>on your very well earned promotion to<br>professor<br>i'm very much looking forward to your<br>lecture and i'm<br>sort of hoping i'll understand it<br>and i'm now going to call on professor<br>richard barker<br>as the pro vice chancellor of sciences<br>to tell you a lot more<br>about boris's academic journey to<br>professor<br>nareya tanakoto tenekoto tanakota<br>professor craig tanakwe deputy vice<br>chancellors<br>tena korowa professor boima tanakwe<br>associate professor wakes tena and<br>chancellor<br>it really is a great pleasure tonight to<br>introduce our speaker professor boris<br>boymer to give us an inaugural professor<br>a lecture<br>at the university of otago as indicated<br>by professor craig<br>boris is one of our newer professors at<br>the university having received a<br>well-deserved promotion to the position<br>of professor in february of this year<br>boris was born in the town of schrumberg<br>in the district of wat<br>rottweil in baden-wurttemberg germany i<br>guess that makes boris a rottweiler<br>and i should also say good morgan to uh<br>boris's parents in the town of<br>schrumberg um<br>my father also lives in germany so um<br>until recently he was only about 30<br>kilometers<br>schoenville and schwarzwald so it's it's<br>a it's a beautiful region<br>and this is where boris grew up it's in<br>southern germany and it's a region known<br>for its beautiful forests and vistas its<br>wonderful preserved meats<br>and for its jovial inhabitants of which<br>of which boris is a prime example and<br>and i should say the<br>boris's interest in mathematics<br>developed at an early age<br>he was gifted by having a father who was<br>a math teacher and i'm sure his father<br>would be very proud to know that this is<br>passed down through the generations not<br>just to the son but the grandson<br>and i'm sure more to come and boris<br>discovered that he had<br>a talent for the subject and and a deep<br>interest in it<br>his undergraduate education or his vou<br>de plum was carried out<br>at our matariki partner institution the<br>university of tubingen<br>and he reports that he was sent from<br>tubingen to the united states to write<br>his master's thesis<br>because his advisor had noticed that he<br>was spending more time playing cards<br>than on his studies he thus completed<br>his phd at louisiana state university in<br>1997 before embarking on a series<br>of visiting professorships and post-docs<br>at the university of nevada in reno<br>where he studied the movement of<br>particles through groundwater and<br>interest<br>that he maintains to this day he also<br>at this time began a lifelong<br>collaboration with mark mierschart<br>who many of you in the department of<br>mathematics and statistics will remember<br>as a former<br>professor of applied mathematics<br>boris's research spans some 47<br>refereed research papers and describes a<br>rich collaboration<br>with people who will be remembered<br>throughout the department i certainly<br>enjoyed reading through the list to<br>brought back many memories<br>it diffusion models feature heavily as<br>do topics such as fractional derivatives<br>and i'm sure boris is going to tell us<br>more about<br>these mysterious subjects shortly he<br>joined the department of mathematics<br>and statistics in 2001 as a lecturer<br>and this is an event that i remember<br>well when boris<br>francis joined us in that in that<br>lovely family and he has since<br>progressed through the academic ranks<br>and reached his present position<br>a professor which we celebrate tonight<br>from the very beginning he established a<br>strong research program<br>and this included a sequence of marsdens<br>that began with a fast start in 2004<br>but it wasn't easy there's a an<br>important tale of persistence here<br>because this fast start was followed by<br>i think two near misses<br>and then boris was rewarded for his<br>persistence with a full master in 2014<br>which he backed up again in 2018.<br>so you've got to keep trying<br>his research has been recognised by his<br>peers he was the recipient of an early<br>career award for distinction and<br>research by the university<br>of otago in 2005 and he was also an<br>invited speaker at the royal society of<br>new zealand in 2013.<br>as professor craig has told us promotion<br>at otago<br>is never just for the excellence in your<br>research our professors have to<br>demonstrate all around<br>excellence and boris has certainly<br>developed into<br>an excellent teacher in his promotion<br>assessment last year the divisional<br>committee which i chaired<br>we're particularly impressed with the<br>work that he has undertaken looking at<br>numeracy of students entering<br>universities<br>and ways in which to address what has<br>been a<br>long-standing and perhaps difficult<br>problem<br>boris has also developed a strong record<br>and professional service he served on<br>the marsden panel<br>also internally on the university of<br>otago research grant panel<br>he's also served on the senate and in my<br>notes i record that he even spoke at<br>senate once<br>which can be a rare event at these<br>meetings<br>it is now time that we heard from boris<br>in his own words and so<br>we'll conclude by noting that<br>mathematicians are notorious for their<br>precise brevity<br>and boris is no exception he summarized<br>the work we're going to hear about<br>tonight<br>in four short sentences and i will<br>summarize this as tonight we're going to<br>hear something about<br>randomness and power laws please join me<br>welcome everyone thanks for coming and<br>uh<br>it certainly is a great pleasure to be<br>standing here and<br>it still brings big smiles to me to my<br>uh well<br>to myself to me every time i think about<br>what just happened how it happened and<br>i'm certainly happy to be here and so<br>tonight i'm going to talk i guess about<br>the power of the limit of a power<br>but before we get into it the first<br>things i have to do is<br>say thank you to a whole bunch of people<br>and uh first person i need to thank it's<br>francis my lovely wife<br>thank you very very much thank you for<br>coming out with me to new zealand<br>there's no hesitation<br>building a life here with me and<br>thank you for um<br>suffering through me sitting at the<br>dinner table rolling my eyes into the<br>back of my head and me wandering off<br>through some banana space or horrible<br>and uh you're having some understanding<br>that yes this might be a time where i<br>should probably shouldn't be disturbed<br>so but also thank you<br>to my parents<br>without their emotional and<br>financial support and backing<br>my journey probably wouldn't have been<br>possible would have been a lot harder<br>you have this banking certainly allows<br>you to take risks with your career<br>wouldn't have been a lot harder to do it<br>without<br>thanks for my lovely children you're<br>great<br>you're giving me a lot less pain than i<br>my former colleagues that started out<br>yeah i see some of you sitting right<br>there um<br>but i started out at university for one<br>for hiring me<br>but also for making me welcome<br>the way that i have but uh<br>i guess one person i need to definitely<br>say thank you to<br>what is my phd supervisor<br>professor neubrinder okay here<br>working with me at the shores of grand<br>isle<br>doing a sabbatical in 2008 and<br>yes the story was certainly that i was<br>sent for a one year<br>visit to louisiana and uh<br>which then turned into two into five and<br>we just worked very well together and so<br>thanks to him thank you for where's the<br>thanks for all you taught me and thanks<br>for a wonderful<br>five six years in louisiana and uh<br>some of you might still remember him the<br>university brought him out as a william<br>evans fellow<br>in 2003 i think but uh<br>the person who influenced my career the<br>most<br>was uh mark milshard<br>who unfortunately is no longer with us<br>he passed away last year but<br>he's certainly the one that<br>took my mathematical career and where i<br>was mathematically<br>as a more pure mathematician into<br>on a more applied course so walking down<br>the halls<br>from university of nevada in reno at one<br>point he asked me will i know anything<br>about<br>fractional derivatives and uh coming<br>from a<br>transform theory background i knew it<br>was just multiplying by<br>by some ik to the alpha how hard can it<br>be so that was my<br>what was my response and from there<br>as certainly a great friendship and<br>great collaboration ensued<br>and uh we met really well together<br>he knew all the apply problems he knew<br>the the modeling he knew<br>the probability of things that i never<br>want to know anything about because that<br>was just<br>horrid and horrific at least what i<br>thought back then<br>yeah where i knew then more the pde<br>theory and the transform theory and we<br>just really messed really really well<br>so we'll hear a lot more about mark<br>tonight but mark<br>this one's for you wherever you are<br>all right but then you know<br>a bit like the oscars thanks to all my<br>collaborators<br>this would have happened to you without<br>you so<br>thanks to reena thanks to dave thanks to<br>michi pedro and all the hours you know<br>you are<br>thank you very much for letting me work<br>with you guys and uh<br>keep going there then of course thanks<br>also the marston fund for supporting me<br>and uh also thanks to the university of<br>otago<br>who i guess really nourished me<br>early on um get me reduced teaching<br>about starting out<br>after my first milestone they promoted<br>me<br>um probably early<br>i you know they even let me have all the<br>overheads<br>from from my first mars in a nice ass<br>account<br>and that money certainly came in handy<br>then doing the sabbatical and so on<br>i managed to organize conferences from<br>there and<br>really helped me keep my collaborations<br>and establish collaborations overseas<br>which are certainly starting out is very<br>very important<br>all right so tonight<br>as to me is really a bit trying to<br>answer the big question<br>so there are i guess a couple answers<br>okay one would be um<br>irritate the future all right so uh<br>that uh certainly if you are either at a<br>bar or<br>at a party somewhere that might be an<br>answer that uh<br>might make me seem a bit more<br>interesting than i really am<br>um if i want to be a bit more honest<br>then uh the answer will probably be<br>something along the lines that we built<br>the tools<br>that allow scientists to predict the<br>future and understand<br>the path certainly how i see the role of<br>mathematicians<br>and there we go there so that includes<br>we create the language to even ask the<br>right questions<br>and like as any language there's poetry<br>there's art there's beauty in the<br>language<br>there are ways where we can actually<br>phrase problems or solve problems<br>that are just absolutely elegant and<br>fantastic<br>and nice to see and there are plenty of<br>mathematicians<br>who focus on that and could care less<br>about<br>the rest of the applications however me<br>another answer to the big question would<br>be i vote these models<br>they'll probably also be a good answer<br>to what do you do<br>yeah so models well we built them<br>conceptual models of reality and then<br>use mathematics to explore<br>what the model does and then infer<br>hopefully back to reality<br>we develop proof solutions we improve on<br>the solution approximation techniques<br>to me that mostly encompasses most of<br>what math is about<br>obviously<br>could also be one of those<br>okay or it could be something along<br>those lines<br>but now the real question is what do<br>there's something very fundamental in<br>common namely they all really just<br>depictions of reality okay<br>so even though the first one walks<br>but she lets me see how i would look<br>at least some models are probably better<br>than others<br>and you know describing what you want<br>them to describe but you know the toy<br>thing i can pick it up and see in how<br>things move and what<br>what the wheels do i probably don't get<br>the aw standing in front of a real sized<br>engine but i can understand a little bit<br>what's going on there<br>and similar on the right hand side<br>that's on purpose so small that you<br>can't really read it but<br>it's an act with aquaphor and equitables<br>and their relationship and<br>i can now build numerical simulations of<br>things like this and see kind of how<br>it would respond to certain different<br>pressures and uh<br>rainfalls or so on and uh depending on<br>the question asked<br>i can have a more accurate or less<br>accurate um answer<br>all right so overview of tonight's talk<br>so first i'm going to talk about the<br>limit<br>then i'm going to talk about the power<br>once we're there then i'm going to talk<br>about the power<br>the title the power of the limit of the<br>tower and<br>if time permits at the end i'm going to<br>talk about the limit of the power of the<br>and then according to the program we're<br>going to have some<br>light refreshments at the staff club<br>and after that i hope you can all join<br>me for some<br>heavier refreshments at eurekas<br>all right so the limit so<br>the limit what is the limit it allows us<br>to talk about approximations without<br>having to talk<br>about the algorithms or<br>specific approximating procedures every<br>time okay<br>the square root of two is a limit<br>of a procedure that would allow me to<br>estimate the square root of two i take a<br>number and squared<br>if i'm less than two i make a little bit<br>bigger if i'm bigger than two i make it<br>a little bit smaller<br>until i get to the square root of two<br>but i'm not going to talk about this<br>every time i'm gonna talk about the<br>square root of two<br>i can just talk about the limit okay the<br>same<br>you know if the limit is some sort of<br>function some form of curve<br>some whatever type of object so limit is<br>an emerging picture object<br>such as a number they often have special<br>properties<br>that the things that approximate the<br>limits don't have<br>i've got my lsu dice um<br>we'll talk about limits of random<br>variables so let's roll some nice<br>okay so if i take a dice and roll it you<br>know we know<br>we're going to have a probability of<br>more or less 1<br>6 for each for each number<br>there you go two once<br>that probability is rather small<br>now that's only has a one and a one so<br>it would be one six times one six<br>gives you one in 36 to hit a three yeah<br>you can get a one or two or two and a<br>one it's twice as many<br>hit a four a one or three three or one<br>or a two and a two<br>three and so thereby it goes up like a<br>level and it comes down<br>like that what about if you have three<br>dice<br>oh looks like that what about four dice<br>five<br>ten twenty fifty and then the whole<br>thing kind of disappears<br>okay so we don't really see too much<br>disappears that's a little bit silly<br>you know 500 how about we do this over<br>again and uh<br>don't leave the top at one but actually<br>just<br>not show what's going on okay so let's<br>do the same thing over again<br>all right so so just the scale here on<br>the left<br>as such that we keep the peak up<br>yeah so 10 50<br>100 500 1000<br>and what you see is that we're going to<br>get narrower and narrower that we're<br>going to have a little needle<br>right there where the mean 3.5 is going<br>to be and we discovered<br>the law of large numbers it's called<br>okay so well we might want to zoom in<br>into that needle a little bit more to<br>see what's happening there<br>oh it's 5 000. okay so let's do the same<br>thing again but now i'm not going to<br>show<br>every plus our possible output i'm only<br>going to show<br>the bit that is within<br>the probabilities within 10 to the minus<br>nine<br>okay of the maximum probability<br>and so if you do that what's happening<br>there<br>is okay that at some point<br>the numbers down here just change but<br>the picture itself<br>doesn't anymore and this is<br>what's called the central limit theory<br>so that's below<br>the limit of<br>oops and so<br>if you now to change the scale to a<br>logarithmic scale so i don't have<br>for men but i now have 10 to the minus 2<br>10 to the minus fourth into minus theta<br>minus eight what we're gonna see<br>is a nice parabola right here<br>i'm gonna take my beautiful dice<br>die<br>so i'll make a<br>here and the five here so now i'm gonna<br>have three fives<br>and roll it again okay so now my<br>probabilities have changed<br>okay how did they change that way<br>i don't have a three anymore i don't<br>have a four anymore<br>okay but i have three fives and so on<br>if i do this to the other guy as well<br>what's going to happen<br>i don't never get any fives together i'm<br>not gonna get any nines<br>because the only way i could get a five<br>is by a one and a four<br>the four doesn't exist anymore or two<br>and a three in the three doesn't exist<br>anymore<br>and i get a distribution that has like<br>three bumps<br>okay if i have three of those dice okay<br>i'm going to get four bumps yeah<br>and what happens as the central limit<br>theorem again kicks in<br>and you're going to end up with the same<br>distribution as you had before<br>the peak a bit more um well it still<br>will be central but of course<br>the number that sits underneath the peak<br>is still going to be on the mean and<br>that's now four times<br>the number of dies rather than 3.5 times<br>number because the average is now<br>and it's still going to be a nice<br>parabola<br>okay so that's the limit<br>the power of this limit as<br>well that's we have our discipline named<br>after it basically it's statistics<br>really is based on that it's the better<br>it's almost universal the limit<br>describes by two parameters but<br>it really the most important thing is<br>that it has a scaling property<br>that x plus x is not 2x<br>but one plus one is not necessarily two<br>but what it does is also it links time<br>and space okay so if you think that you<br>can roll a dice every minute<br>then on the left hand side it will take<br>you<br>two minutes or a thousand minutes if you<br>have a thousand dice<br>you know where on the right hand side<br>you just take your original distribution<br>and you can<br>blow it up and so you're just making it<br>larger<br>and you're getting a much uh get a<br>spatial<br>feature that you didn't have in your<br>temple so it links time and space<br>so this limit distribution has much much<br>stronger properties than<br>the distributions that approximate it<br>that come together<br>and give you this limit okay and so this<br>then also allows you you know to do<br>things like stochastic integration<br>it's basically the basis of all kinds of<br>diffusion models<br>diffusion uncertainty component of more<br>complex systems<br>and so on the list goes on and on and on<br>this is the model<br>that most of our work is actually based<br>on<br>okay so the power<br>i want to talk about the power and<br>one prime example that things are<br>slightly different when you talk about<br>so let's do a little thought experiment<br>okay so um<br>let's assume we take two people in this<br>room at random<br>and the combined height is four meters<br>okay what is the individual height<br>no i thought york would be here but<br>close to two meters each okay<br>what about if their combined income<br>would you assume that each of them is<br>making three hundred thousand dollars<br>or would you say it's much more likely<br>one of them makes five hundred thousand<br>and the other one makes one hundred<br>thousand<br>i mean how many people do you know that<br>make four hundred thousand dollars a<br>year<br>not too many i mean you know when we<br>but actually that is an interesting<br>thought too<br>how many people do you know that make<br>twice as much money as you do<br>and of those how many do they know that<br>make twice as much money<br>twice as much money as them<br>and among those do you think they know<br>someone who makes twice as much money as<br>them<br>does anybody know that having enough<br>money a lot of money doesn't make you<br>happy<br>because there's always somebody else who<br>is a lot richer than you are<br>and you get new circles and again<br>there's going to be somebody who's a lot<br>richer than you are keeping up with the<br>challenges jones isn't getting you<br>anywhere<br>this is actually a pretty burrito<br>discover this<br>in i think 1905 but uh here's a<br>more recent publication here that uh<br>japanese personal income french total<br>assets<br>and they follow this straight line in<br>log log plot<br>which means it is a power<br>law relationship between the two and<br>hence also the work of power<br>to those distributions<br>now we also see that<br>in self-organizing things like youtube<br>hits<br>i mean you can get a much straighter<br>or dispersal<br>okay see disposal so but i did say they<br>took i forgot which tree that took a<br>tree and<br>put up traps and then said okay let's<br>see where we can find<br>the seeds okay and so the classical<br>model<br>based on our central limit theorem i<br>would say that should look something<br>like that or maybe like that<br>but they found<br>they're basically everywhere where they<br>put up traps which can be very<br>frustrating and say okay i guess we have<br>to do that again and put them even<br>so we have a nice correlation of<br>the area and the frequency how often<br>those length lines have so big ones<br>happen not as often as<br>smaller ones but they actually follow a<br>but you have to wonder well it's<br>so what you see here is over<br>oops sorry over<br>12 orders of magnitude<br>okay the range of sizes of particles<br>hitting<br>i mean can't get much straighter than<br>that<br>so it seems to be<br>well why nobody knows why as far as i<br>know<br>okay but it would be quite interesting<br>to know i think why those power laws are<br>there<br>and why they persist so what i can tell<br>you later on<br>is that once you have them why you can't<br>get rid of them<br>okay but how you get them in the first<br>place i think is still<br>we can also have those power laws in<br>time<br>called intermittency or a hidden markov<br>process sitting behind something<br>continuous hammer and walk all kinds of<br>names for that that are based on that so<br>these are now<br>tiny quantum dots now they blink<br>and so they just looked at how often do<br>they blink or when<br>what is the time between the blinking<br>and the time between the blinking<br>s again sits on a straight<br>line in log blood<br>so if something happens<br>every time you have a blinking going on<br>then you have a process again where you<br>might have<br>want to have some understanding of those<br>powers<br>okay last one about the earth i like<br>those slides<br>so whenever you need a reference<br>to do a scale okay you're probably<br>well you know more or less scale free<br>regime and you're going to probably have<br>to five going to find some<br>sort of power law okay so here we have a<br>dirt<br>there's a little i hope it's visible a<br>little lens cap right there<br>okay here's another one the lens cap is<br>over here<br>and they look reasonably similar okay<br>but we have it for scale<br>but the real revealing picture is the<br>following<br>uh here's scott tyler next to his huge<br>lens cap<br>okay trying to make a point that scale<br>all right so the limit of a power so<br>what happens if<br>instead of starting with a dice if you<br>start out with something that has<br>a power law like that okay so<br>well the easiest power we say that the<br>probability of<br>my random variable exceeding a number<br>decays like n to the minus 1.5<br>that's where the power comes from this<br>would be a nice straight line with slope<br>minus 1.5<br>okay so the beginning the probability<br>it seems to stabilize so in this case it<br>actually does not<br>converge towards the gaussian<br>it will converge towards something that<br>has looks like that<br>in semi-log plot it's not this parabola<br>it's something that still has this<br>power law on the right hand side<br>so it's like well it is a limit<br>it is the limit and it's called the<br>stable limit or<br>a stable density in in this case<br>that those power laws will converge so<br>the limit of power loss is actually<br>not the gaussian and the gaussian is<br>more or less universal<br>except in this case and uh<br>so the power of the limit of the power<br>is now where my research is<br>and this is about now exploiting those<br>limit functions those densities<br>to see whether we can do something<br>similar as we did with the gaussian<br>of particles of whatever it is<br>of of seeds that have those<br>dispersal probabilities that have those<br>intermittencies<br>or whatever it is and exploit the<br>scaling<br>property of those limits so that because<br>we do have the scaling product so again<br>we have this linkage<br>between time and space now it's not<br>two to the one over to the one half<br>which would be the square root of two<br>now it is two to the one over alpha that<br>is alpha<br>is the parameter at that decay parameter<br>decay parameter of my original density<br>okay so i have again one more parameter<br>so instead of two parameters mean and<br>variance<br>now i have three parameters which kind<br>of is location<br>and the<br>the shape and then the scaling<br>this is the basis then of my fractional<br>diffusion models can also be used<br>to model intermittency<br>okay the governing equations they do<br>have fractional derivatives instead of<br>second order derivatives<br>so the laplace operator will turn into<br>some mixture of fractional<br>operators to evernote but one of the<br>problems is<br>is that there's no nice formulas<br>for the density of the limit so the<br>gaussian has this additional nice thing<br>that is just e to the minus x squared<br>times some constant this one here<br>we only know as a nice formula in<br>transform space<br>in real space we can make a special<br>function<br>and now computers can handle those<br>rather easily but it us to me also<br>explains<br>a bit why they haven't been<br>so first back<br>in 2001 uh still in in reno<br>the first i worked with with mark<br>was to say okay we can extend this<br>basic limit theorem which was already<br>discovered by levy in the 1930s<br>and two more than one dimension<br>okay so this is an article about<br>operator levy motion so those are levy<br>densities<br>and how to extend this in two dimensions<br>and uh<br>and then apply those not just in physics<br>but then also in<br>in hydrology so that is in water<br>resources research<br>their solutions and hopefully they can<br>estimate parameters<br>from a given um<br>data set of some plume<br>that sits underground and want to<br>describe of how this might evolve<br>over time in the active okay<br>so operator scaling solute mixing and<br>dispersion and so you work your way up<br>exploiting the fact that we have this<br>relationship with space and time<br>to move away from a strict spatial<br>component<br>and say we go we use the temporal load<br>road first<br>and then follow the flow lines to<br>a special geometry whatever german<br>whatever flow fields we have<br>in order to do that though we first had<br>to actually prove mathematically<br>that we are allowed to do that we can do<br>that so this is a paper<br>journal of evolution equations together<br>with with michi and marcus<br>that uh<br>so i thought we had a reasonably nice<br>engineering approach to whatever goes on<br>then the referee got their hands on it<br>and made it more modern<br>mathematically and it turned out to be<br>completely unreadable<br>but still nice and true but it took us a<br>few more years to translate then<br>whatever we did to be able to say okay<br>you can take your<br>your big groundwater dispersion model<br>and then use this fractional bit to say<br>the sun<br>on the subgrids we can accelerate in<br>each subgrid our particles<br>the way they need to be accelerated to<br>give you<br>all right now<br>once you have your basic diffusion model<br>going<br>you can extend on those by now adding<br>things like reaction reaction means<br>quite often in the fifth and in the in<br>the biological rules birth and death<br>okay you die yeah or you regenerate<br>and multiply and uh so<br>here we now we have a fractional<br>movement so a<br>movement where we have a power law<br>dispersal<br>and then we have some growth and some<br>decay<br>wherever we are and managed to<br>describe this reasonably well<br>the one thing that we cannot really<br>describe and i'll get to that a little<br>bit later<br>is that all those models will be<br>mean field models meaning it's but we<br>really<br>the only thing that we can get out of it<br>is what will happen<br>on average or yeah so we will not be<br>able to describe<br>the dandelion we blow it where is the<br>seed going to go and where's the next<br>colony going to be established<br>but we can potentially get a risk<br>surface of<br>uh where um but the probability is that<br>we're going to see something 20<br>kilometers down the road 50 kilometers<br>down the rate<br>where do you need to put on your<br>eradication effort<br>that you how far do you have to go to be<br>95<br>we also provide numerical tools to<br>actually be able to<br>i guess the one anecdote that i was<br>trying to get rid of at some point<br>that's still on my tongue<br>it's one of my favorite ones from of<br>mark<br>is where i was really really excited to<br>figure out something<br>and and he basically said them it's nice<br>as they understand something boris<br>okay it's not worth a thing<br>until you explain it to somebody else<br>and they understand it<br>because otherwise only you know it and<br>what's the use of that<br>okay and that not only<br>for him not only meant that he should be<br>able to understand what i'm thinking<br>but then also the scientists should be<br>able to understand what we are thinking<br>and that might then involve not just<br>putting<br>it to somewhere into a science journal<br>but you might have to explain it to<br>the biologists to the ecologists to the<br>hydrologists<br>to the physicists in their own in their<br>own language<br>so it can actually be used<br>and i think that was very sage advice<br>okay so here<br>talking about intermittency so that's<br>the first time where we<br>um<br>there we basically inverted the spatial<br>process into a time process<br>and uh showed that if you have<br>a nice and a nice process doesn't have<br>intermittency if you throw intermittency<br>on top of it<br>so things only happen when um your<br>quantum dot is blinking or whatever it<br>is<br>that then you're going to have a nice<br>solution that you can get from the old<br>solution by<br>just randomizing time okay<br>i wrote up the main my proof of that<br>one afternoon in a little world document<br>that big and said look what<br>that seems to be that i don't know<br>whether it's worth anything and i didn't<br>really think it was worth much and<br>i said oh no that's kind of neat let's<br>let's write this up and send it in<br>like okay but i have a feeling that's<br>been done somewhere else i can't quite<br>see it i can't quite<br>but no no no he he insisted that we send<br>it in and put in so we put it in this<br>little rinky-dink journal that's just<br>but i don't get any credit for it<br>because it was in a journal before that<br>journal was really indexed within<br>any of those citation matrix things so<br>uh<br>if you look at my h value it's one more<br>okay and that then ballooned into again<br>showing how this would apply or how this<br>would affect<br>solute transport in groundwater so we<br>now we have<br>an immobile zone basically where the<br>particles sit while they are<br>intermittent while they're not blinking<br>okay and uh how they move when they're<br>in a mobile zone and there's a nice<br>decomposition<br>and a nice math behind that okay then we<br>can link<br>time and space as well and this one here<br>would be something where we have a<br>finite<br>mean waiting time but infinite variance<br>waiting time<br>and<br>a big part of the research is also what<br>to do with uh<br>numerical approximations and so here's<br>one way to<br>approximate our solutions doing it<br>better than<br>most of them did we have your higher<br>order conversions<br>and uh there was a it's a well-received<br>paper<br>and then uh my reason my most recent<br>milestone<br>is now what do you do if you have those<br>uh<br>scaling limits which are things that are<br>by everyday very nature are supported on<br>all of<br>space even even the normal distribution<br>e to the minus x squared is positive<br>you know from minus infinity to infinity<br>what do you do how do you restrict this<br>to a bounded domain and uh so we are<br>exploring that<br>in uh our current marston<br>all right and uh this was more the right<br>up for the<br>so the last five minutes or last three<br>minutes we'll talk a little bit about<br>the limit of the power of the limit<br>of the power so<br>yeah told you all kinds of things and<br>showed you all kinds of fancy journal<br>titles<br>so one problem<br>is well it's only three parameters still<br>very parsimonious but they're still very<br>parsimonious models<br>but they are still very hard to estimate<br>by their very nature<br>okay they are low probability of making<br>very very large jumps<br>so if you find one or two and well they<br>flew 10 kilometers further than what<br>they had before<br>your tail estimate or whatever you have<br>will vary greatly with that<br>so unless we find a way to be able to<br>predict our tail parameters from<br>other mechanisms okay why is this<br>self-organizing thing happening<br>okay why is this giving us those power<br>laws why are there<br>chunks of stuff flying through space<br>that are power law<br>why is youtube working the way it is<br>not many people know about it they<br>certainly haven't told me about it and i<br>haven't found about it<br>french mathematician sabatier<br>i think he's in bardo he lists about 14<br>different<br>methods that will generate power laws<br>coming out<br>but how each one of them would really<br>apply<br>to a given situation as again<br>still a total mystery i already talked<br>about models our kind of mean fields<br>we can only give a risk sources we<br>cannot really predict<br>where the next colony is going to be but<br>show by a simulation<br>is that if you were to<br>build a model where you take seeds and<br>you throw<br>them randomly out and then build new<br>colonies<br>that the only way that you can get um<br>patterns that you might see in nature<br>that you have a main colony another<br>little colony another<br>called different little colonies rather<br>than one big blob moving out<br>is that you're going to need power loss<br>in order<br>to get you out there okay<br>and then even though i had a marshal on<br>that the quantification of uncertainty<br>is still a mystery we made some progress<br>but uh to really know how far what what<br>those<br>um aerobats should be is uh<br>very helpful all right miss that<br>it is my great pleasure to be here at<br>professor bauman boris's ipl and giving<br>the thanks as hedge department of the<br>maths and stats department<br>um i'd like to thank boris for the<br>really interesting and informative<br>lecture on the power of the limit of a<br>power<br>have to get that right as well as your<br>heartfelt tribute to your longtime<br>collaborator<br>mark mir stat that was lovely so you've<br>taken us on a journey<br>of discovery to the limit of a power<br>through the exploration of that limit<br>distribution you've shown us the very<br>useful properties it has<br>and how these can be exploited to give<br>valuable insights<br>into what happens in the limit you've<br>then connected this fundamental<br>understanding of the limits of power to<br>the use of power laws<br>in such diverse disciplines such as<br>ecology<br>physics statistics mathematics<br>finance possibly gambling<br>i actually think you've uh you've that<br>the answer to life the universe and<br>everything is not 42.<br>i think it's a power law and i think<br>boris has discovered it<br>i would also like to acknowledge the<br>important work<br>boris has done supporting students with<br>low numeracy<br>as well the peer assisted numeracy pan<br>program<br>he was instrumental in developing has<br>the key message he told me yesterday<br>confidence comes from competence um<br>boris has connected us to this idea<br>tonight i think<br>he's demonstrated that by having<br>confidence in the limit of a power<br>we can be empowered to build<br>expert models which will ultimately help<br>us understand the world better<br>so thank you for that boris that was<br>really informative<br>um i've also discovered a few things<br>about boris i think he's a secret abba<br>fan<br>i noticed the money money money quote at<br>the top<br>so that's an interesting thing i'll take<br>away with me<br>um so i would<br>uh boris please we have an item of<br>appreciation here<br>um your lecture today so please accept<br>this<br>um i'd just like to thank again<br>everybody for attending this really<br>special occasion for boris<br>in particular boris's family both here<br>um and<br>in germany australia and and everywhere<br>his friends his colleagues and<br>all the students that have turned up as<br>well so thank you very much<br>um and i'd like to invite you to join<br>the academic party<br>for refreshments in the staff club now</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
