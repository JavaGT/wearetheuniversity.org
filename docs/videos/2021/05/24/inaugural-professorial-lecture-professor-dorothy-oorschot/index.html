Her 3D anatomical data of the healthy brain is foundational to computer models that increase knowledge on behaviour and motor control. She was instrumental in creating a new animal model of hypoxic brain injury due to extreme prematurity to investigate treatments. This is relevant to decreasing ADHD and memory deficits. She also researches changes in brain circuits in schizophrenia and hypoxic-induced cerebral palsy, including the investigation of treatments.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

tena koto tenakota katta<br>kia ora my name's helen nicholson and<br>i'm the acting vice chancellor of the<br>university of otago<br>and it's my pleasure to welcome you all<br>to this occasion to celebrate dorothy<br>orshot's promotion to professor<br>it's good to see many colleagues from<br>anatomy in the wider university<br>as well as students and friends and<br>thank<br>the university chancellor as well<br>but i'd like to give a very special<br>welcome to dorothy's family<br>who are joining us from perth by live<br>stream<br>so to dorothy's parents theo and eve<br>her sister sue and her nephew john paul<br>her brother andy<br>and her friend barbara and from the<br>north island<br>close friends graeme and ruth and here<br>in person<br>close friends gareth and beryl betty<br>so promotion to professor at otago is<br>not something<br>that comes easily dorothy has gone<br>through a rigorous process where she's<br>demonstrated that she's achieved<br>sustained outstanding leadership and<br>sustained<br>outstanding competence in two of the<br>three areas of research<br>teaching and service now professor<br>hyland is shortly going to<br>give a formal introduction to dorothy<br>but i just want to say a few words as a<br>fellow anatomist<br>so dorothy has made a significant<br>contribution to the department<br>and the wider division over the years<br>these include being head of department<br>and more recently the associate dean<br>medical education for the school<br>dorothy's attention to detail is<br>legendary<br>and this school has this skill has<br>played an important role<br>in guiding the medical school through<br>its most recent successful<br>accreditation as well as this<br>dorothy is a very dedicated organized<br>and successful<br>teacher she was also among the first<br>neuroscientists in the<br>world to adapt modern design-based<br>stereological sampling<br>and counting techniques for light and<br>electron microscopy<br>and due to her meticulous descriptions<br>of her methodology<br>and active participation in conferences<br>and workshops<br>she's been instrumental in advancing<br>unbiased quantitative methods for<br>microscopy in neuro<br>biology internationally i think i speak<br>for many in saying that dorothy has a<br>real heart for the department<br>and really cares for each of us so<br>dorothy we're very proud of you<br>and we want to congratulate on you on<br>greetings greetings to you all uh as<br>introduced by the<br>vice chancellor okay<br>vice chancellor i'm brian hyland i'm the<br>current dean of the school of biomedical<br>sciences<br>it's my great pleasure and a privilege<br>to introduce<br>professor dorothy orshot's inaugural<br>professorial lecture<br>i have to say of course much my thunder<br>has been stolen<br>by the vice chancellor so i'm<br>nevertheless going to repeat<br>some of the things that she said because<br>i think they're worth repeating<br>dorothy graduated with a bsc honours in<br>1983<br>majoring in anatomy human biology and<br>neuroscience in western australia<br>but she chose to come to here to otago<br>to do her phd<br>which he completed in good time in 1987<br>he was immediately recruited and i think<br>this is a sign of quality<br>immediately recruited post phd<br>into the department as assistant<br>lecturer and<br>progressed through the ranks to senior<br>lecturer in 1999<br>associate professor in 2008<br>now with promotion to professor as<br>a vice chancellor has indicated this<br>indicates<br>a evidence of sustained outstanding<br>leadership and performance<br>pretty much actually across the board of<br>the roles of an academic at this<br>university and that's<br>assessed not only by our local<br>promotions committee<br>but by international referees<br>so just quickly in the few minutes that<br>i have to summarize<br>dorothy's achievements as mentioned<br>sustained outstanding service leadership<br>we can highlight in particular<br>picking up the deputy head of department<br>role in anatomy<br>2007 segwaying directly from that into<br>the headship<br>of the department of anatomy 2009 and at<br>that time as now<br>one of the largest departments at the<br>university then with<br>around 100 staff and double a number of<br>postgraduate students and<br>countless undergraduate students as we<br>know<br>so a major responsibility more laterally<br>as also indicated dorothy served the<br>school of biomedical sciences as<br>associate dean<br>for medical education for five years<br>2014<br>and that's a vital role that interfaces<br>our biomedical<br>teaching through to the medical program<br>as well as<br>having direct input into the development<br>of the<br>medical program itself<br>in addition to this associate dean role<br>and and<br>headship of department roles her<br>teaching leadership has included<br>extensive<br>leadership roles in the department<br>teaching across all the programs in both<br>sciences<br>and health sciences she's played a<br>significant role in the department<br>in teaching staff development through<br>appointment as a nominated teaching<br>mentor for multiple staff in the<br>department over the years<br>and at the interface of teaching and<br>research dorothy has mentored more than<br>36 postgraduate students across the<br>range phd<br>masters honours and postgraduate diploma<br>many of these students achieving<br>high outcomes and awards and so on<br>during the course of their studies<br>in terms of research outputs and<br>recognition dorothy has funded her work<br>continuously since 1998 with<br>a succession of external grants and<br>she's engaged in highly fruitful<br>international and national<br>collaborations as a result<br>of these inputs we have therefore<br>obviously a string of<br>outputs high impact publications senior<br>or first author on 54<br>full-length outputs 83 percent is first<br>or senior author which is a very high<br>proportion reflecting leadership in the<br>research<br>and they span across book chapters books<br>invited reviews and articles and<br>journals of course<br>and those journals that she publishes in<br>top of the range journals in their<br>fields such as brain<br>progress in neurobiology animals of<br>neurology journal of neuroscience and so<br>forth<br>it's also i think it's important to note<br>here that in addition to the work that<br>dorothy publishes herself<br>the careful and precise data that she<br>obtains in her work<br>and publishes is widely used by others<br>in fields of theoretical neuroscience<br>and computer modelling of brain function<br>critical information that is highly<br>valued by workers<br>in those areas and those people then<br>publish<br>their work also in high impact journals<br>such as neuron and plos biology<br>their international standing in the<br>field is recognized through her being<br>elected<br>to the position of australasian vice<br>president<br>uh for the international society for<br>stereology<br>effectively continuously since 2004<br>and serves as the australia australasian<br>member of the governing council of the<br>international basal ganglia society<br>and of course journal editorial board<br>memberships and so<br>the on directions have focused<br>on the anatomy of the nervous system in<br>fine detail<br>in health and disease she's a particular<br>interest<br>and is a leading international authority<br>in the brain region known as the<br>basal ganglia which is critical for<br>normal movement and multiple<br>other functions also spinal cord<br>hypothalamus<br>and the connection pathways between<br>different brain regions<br>for these studies she brings to be a<br>range of methods and again<br>has particular international standing as<br>mentioned<br>in the field of three-dimensional<br>quantitative assessment<br>of the cellular makeup of the brain<br>using systematic approach which is known<br>as<br>stereology and in the visualization of<br>the brain at resolutions ranging from<br>light to<br>electron microscopy over recent years<br>her work has extended<br>into the effect of brain injury and<br>investigations of potential protectors<br>of the brain<br>to mitigate against injury effects on<br>this fine structure<br>of the nervous system in particular<br>these studies are focused on animal<br>models of developmental injury<br>affecting the unborn infant including<br>third trimester cerebral palsy<br>and extreme prematurity these studies<br>have potential impact beyond the unborn<br>infant<br>to our understanding of later onset<br>developmental disorders<br>such as schizophrenia and attention<br>deficit hyperactivity disorder<br>so in her talk dorothy i understand will<br>give us an overview of her research and<br>focus in particular on her work<br>on potential treatments to rescue the<br>injured developing brain<br>once again it's my pleasure and<br>privilege to introduce dorothy<br>professor orshot to deliver her<br>inaugural professorial lecture<br>i greet you both helen and brian<br>tinikoto tinikoto tinikoto katuwa<br>i greet you once twice<br>three times uh core dorothy or shot toku<br>i know my name is dorothy orshot<br>called darling range to mona the<br>mountain that i affiliate too is the<br>darling range<br>sorry course one river taiwa river that<br>i affiliate to is the swan river<br>nor perth western australia and the<br>netherlands aho i am from perth western<br>australia<br>therefore greetings three times over for<br>the<br>so it's a privilege today to give you<br>this inaugural professorial lecture<br>and i thank you all for coming<br>especially since it seems to be the most<br>wintry day<br>um as you can see uh the title is brain<br>circuitry<br>matters and this is a side view of the<br>human brain<br>and what i hope to show you during this<br>talk is that what's inside that brain in<br>terms of nerve cells<br>and supporting cells matters<br>it matters in terms of normal function<br>as well as injury<br>and also in disease<br>now as i've said in my introduction on<br>mihi<br>i come from outside<br>new zealand so i come from perth western<br>australia<br>so to start my talk i need to take you<br>there<br>so here is perth on this map this map is<br>taken<br>from the atlas that i use during my<br>and hopefully you can see next to perth<br>that there's also fremantle<br>shown and also the darling range and<br>both of those are<br>important parts of my heritage so if we<br>magnify<br>this a bit more and just look at western<br>australia you can see that the<br>perth is in in the biggest letters<br>because that's indicating that it's the<br>capital<br>uh city of perth so if we increase<br>so we look in closer detail at perth<br>this map here<br>it actually shows some of the key<br>features of my heritage<br>so firstly the green area on the right<br>is the darling range<br>so that's the mountain that i affiliate<br>too i'm in the middle<br>there's the swan river which is the<br>river that i affiliate to<br>and then fremantle is where i was born<br>so that's the port suburb of perth<br>where i was born now fremantle's also<br>important for my parents because they<br>came into perth via the port of mantle<br>on ships<br>and they came on their ships from the<br>netherlands or holland<br>so where is the netherlands or holland<br>in case you don't know so here's a<br>world map and the netherlands is a<br>pretty small country sitting next to<br>england<br>and they migrated from the netherlands<br>or holland<br>uh to perth australia now they migrated<br>in the 1950s<br>they migrated with their parents and<br>their siblings<br>to perth they didn't know each other in<br>holland<br>they came with their families and they<br>met in perth and married in purse<br>so where did they come from in the<br>netherlands my mum comes from the centre<br>of the netherlands called utrecht<br>and my dad comes from more south in the<br>town of<br>eindhoven now eindhoven is also markets<br>itself<br>as a city of innovation and while we<br>were growing up my dad would tell me<br>about the philips factory<br>that was there and later on i realized<br>that<br>possibly from that factory or at least<br>from that company<br>they produced the transmission electric<br>microscopes that i used in my research<br>so there are two reasons why eindhoven<br>so you can see now why i have a dutch<br>surname because my parents are dutch<br>but you might think but you you have<br>dark hair<br>and most people from holland are<br>actually fair or they are actually<br>blonde well you'll see in a moment that<br>i get my dark hair from my dad<br>and he gets his attack here from his dad<br>and<br>we don't know what happened before that<br>because we haven't done<br>we haven't done the family history but<br>we do know<br>in the past that uh people from the<br>south like from france and spain<br>migrated into i came to holland and took<br>over took it over basically and possibly<br>that's how the dark hair<br>came into our family so here's a picture<br>of my<br>dad my parents to show you that i look<br>like my dad<br>and i don't look like my mum who looks<br>very dutch with the blonde hair or fair<br>hair<br>and at this point i would like to honor<br>my parents and say how much<br>i appreciate all their support over many<br>many years<br>now as you'll see my fam my parents had<br>four children<br>um in a minute you will see that uh and<br>they raised a family in perth<br>and here's a picture of perth showing<br>you the skyline<br>um in the background you can also see<br>this<br>the river the swan river here and also<br>the black swans<br>now i said i was born in perth western<br>australia<br>but actually it's more correct to say we<br>were born<br>in perth western australia because i'm<br>actually an identical twin<br>so therefore i have a obviously have a<br>twin sister<br>so here's a picture of us of the family<br>of four<br>in our younger days and you know<br>hopefully you can see that the twins<br>now three things to say about this<br>particular image<br>the first thing is that when we were<br>younger mum took the twins out in the<br>pram<br>people would look at the twins and<br>they'd look at my mum and they'd go<br>so she had a constant question<br>also i'd like to say at this point it's<br>been an honor to be a twin it's really<br>nice to have someone else on the planet<br>who actually sees the world like you do<br>mostly and then also it's been an<br>honor to have brother brothers as well<br>so we were raised in perth and we all<br>went to<br>uh this is our school and we all went to<br>state primary schools and a state high<br>school so we didn't go to private<br>schools we went to the state schools<br>and i did all my classes with my twin<br>sister and in year 11 and 12 we studied<br>human biology<br>now year 11 and 12 in the west<br>australian system was the entry<br>years into university so this was like<br>university entrance<br>but it was actually called the tertiary<br>admittance exam<br>now in these years human biology was my<br>favorite subject<br>easily and i actually thought the human<br>body was absolutely amazing<br>and i actually wanted to keep studying<br>the human body so i looked at whether<br>there was a course available<br>at university of west australia on human<br>biology and there was<br>so i went on and did my bsc in anatomy<br>and human biology at the university of<br>western australia<br>this was a rare course at the time in<br>the sense that<br>as a science student not many students<br>could study anatomy<br>you had to be like a dentist or a<br>medical student<br>it was only actually available in uwa<br>and in queensland at the time<br>and i was pleased that this course was<br>available at the uwa<br>because it was in my home city so it's<br>in my home university<br>so here's a picture of uwa the campus<br>and this arrow points to where the<br>department of anatomy and human biology<br>was actually located<br>now you can see it's close to the<br>foreshore it's actually close to the<br>swan river<br>but we didn't spend a lot of time<br>sitting on the foreshore appreciating<br>its ambience because we're getting<br>appreciating the<br>so bc at uwa what were some of the<br>challenges<br>well one of the challenges was that my<br>grandfather said to my parents<br>um why are you sending your daughter to<br>university<br>that's a complete waste of time she's<br>just going to go and get married and<br>have children<br>so why don't you why are you sending her<br>there<br>now if uh that was that generational<br>view and he didn't know anything else<br>that's what happened in this generation<br>thankfully my parents were supportive of<br>sending their daughter to university<br>the other challenge was that towards the<br>end of semester one<br>i thought this is actually quite a<br>lonely place<br>obviously i've been at school with my<br>sister all the time now i come to this<br>place my sister didn't come to<br>university she went in<br>another course a dental therapy course<br>and um so i talked over with my mum and<br>we decided that<br>even though i i thought about getting a<br>job instead leaving university<br>discuss it with my mum and we just we<br>decided that i should keep going<br>so i did keep going and i must have<br>focused enough because i got the first<br>year prize in botany<br>and that was a surprise<br>um especially because i was in a traffic<br>jam before the exam<br>and i just got to the exam on time but<br>anyway i was pleased i got the first<br>surprise in botany but it gave me a<br>dilemma<br>should i keep going in botany or should<br>i keep going in biology<br>and at the time i thought well i think<br>perhaps humans are more important than<br>plants so i'll keep going with humans<br>so i kept going with humans also in my<br>third year i stayed at st catherine's<br>college<br>which is a residential college next to<br>the campus<br>and i did that to decrease the travel<br>time because i was traveling<br>one hour each way in my first two years<br>commuting into<br>my university lectures and i just want<br>to comment that<br>how important residential colleges are<br>for connectedness and for a sense of<br>so in my second and third year<br>neuroscience courses they were taught by<br>associate professor garris jones<br>who is here in the audience and at the<br>time he was also<br>the head of the department of anatomy<br>and human biology<br>so at this point i need to just tell you<br>a little bit about the about the nervous<br>system so that you can follow the rest<br>of the lecture so this is what i learned<br>in these courses<br>at the beginning so here's a typical<br>structure of a nerve cell<br>so they've got five key elements here so<br>this is the<br>center of the nerve cell it's called the<br>cell body or the stoma<br>and then there are processes radiating<br>out from it<br>called dendrites and then there's one<br>act one process going this way<br>which is called an axon and it's covered<br>in myelin<br>which enables it to convey the<br>electrical activity<br>efficiently and then this nerve cell<br>connects to another nerve cell via<br>synapses<br>so anatomically these are the key<br>elements of<br>a nerve cell and i've looked at all<br>these components<br>as in my career as you'll see<br>so i did my bse then i went on did on<br>and did a bsc honours<br>at uwa and at this point i need to<br>highlight<br>the similarities between the rat the cat<br>and the human brain<br>now you may not think they look that<br>similar there in terms of size<br>but actually there are similar<br>the same they have the same main brain<br>region<br>so for example this region here is also<br>here and here<br>and this region is here here and here<br>and then this part is here and here and<br>here<br>now there's a difference in size but<br>those main brain regions are there<br>across the different species<br>and that means that what you could do in<br>studying the rat does have some<br>relevance<br>to the human and they largely have a<br>similar internal structure<br>in terms of the nerve cell types and in<br>terms of human ethics in terms of the<br>things that i study<br>i have studied like synapses and axons<br>um basically to study that you need dead<br>tissue<br>so that would mean if you're going to do<br>it in a human you need a<br>dead human obviously which is not ideal<br>so for imaging we actually do a lot of<br>the work in<br>animals like rats and we also<br>for clinical work you don't want to try<br>something first off in clinic in humans<br>you want to first do a pre-clinical<br>trial in animals<br>and see if it works there and if it<br>works there take it through to a<br>clinical translation<br>so that's why a lot of my work is<br>actually on using the rat<br>now just to point out in case you're<br>interested why is it so big for the<br>human<br>it's probably related to our ability to<br>speak<br>so for my honest research what did i do<br>well gareth jones was my supervisor and<br>here we are<br>and this is actually a group photo at<br>the time from my honours here<br>so for my honours research i looked at a<br>new animal model<br>which is actually a rat model related to<br>phenol ketonuria or pku<br>and it's known that if you have<br>untreated pku that you have a severe<br>intellectual impairment<br>which is why when you're born they do a<br>heel prick to test whether you've<br>actually got<br>the metabolic change which leads to bku<br>and then put you on a special diet to<br>stop you from developing pku<br>so we asked the question is this severe<br>intellectual payment due to fewer<br>synapses<br>and here's a picture from or an image<br>from my honest thesis<br>and here is a synapse you can see<br>this is the pre-synaptic part it's got a<br>very distinctive structure made of<br>synaptic vesicles<br>and this is the post-synaptic part and<br>this is a magnification that<br>almost fifty thousand so it shows you<br>how tiny these actually are<br>and why we need to see them in a<br>transmission electron microscope<br>so my honors year was a thesis only year<br>so there were no papers just<br>during the thesis and this is my first<br>experience of being at the frontiers<br>at the frontier of research which is<br>what research is<br>going on you at the frontiers no one<br>else has done this type of research<br>before<br>we investigated the developing brain<br>which is the recurring theme in my<br>career<br>and what we found the key result was<br>that we did find fewer synapses<br>in the animals that were were the pku<br>animals compared to the<br>control animals and this is a paper that<br>we published at that time<br>now at the end of my honours year i need<br>to decide what to do next<br>should i keep on studying or not and it<br>took me all<br>the summer to decide what to do so i<br>applied for various jobs<br>and they all said to me you should do a<br>phd<br>um gary said to me um offered me a<br>position to do a phd in his<br>laboratory um that was one opportunity<br>now his laboratory was actually moving<br>from perth to dunedin because he'd been<br>offered the professor of anatomy in the<br>department of inanim in the department<br>of anatomy here<br>and that was two contexts and the other<br>one was that um garrus was the only<br>only neuroscientist at uwa while at<br>otago there was already a neuroscience<br>research center and a brain health<br>research center<br>which actually meant that there was<br>potential for collaboration and you can<br>see that during my career i've actually<br>used that so for those reasons people<br>suggesting i do a phd<br>i went and did a phd and moved from<br>perth to dunedin<br>and i spent my first year at uwa<br>and then the rest of my time at<br>university of otago and this is a<br>picture of me at the time<br>from the departmental archives<br>so my supervisor was professor gareth<br>jones for this research<br>and during the time i had two<br>commonwealth phd scholarships<br>one for my time at uwa and one<br>also for my time at otago and for this<br>research i cultured rat brain tissue<br>at both universities and what that means<br>is you took tissue from a<br>young animal and then you kept it alive<br>in an incubator<br>and changed the various conditions the<br>the nutrients it was growing in<br>i first when i first arrived i stayed at<br>knox college and this was another<br>example<br>of the benefits of when you knew coming<br>to a residential<br>college and having all the connectedness<br>and some of my friends that i met there<br>are watching this live stream also at<br>this time i'd like to thank the jones<br>family for all their support during the<br>time<br>they welcomed me into their family when<br>i first<br>arrived and okay so what did we do for<br>my phd research well the theme was to<br>improve regeneration by axons<br>and this is relevant to spinal cord<br>injury and the hypothesis that we<br>examined was that<br>proliferating non-neuronal cells or<br>proliferating<br>non-nerve cells may constitute a<br>physical and or chemical barrier two<br>regenerating axons in the brain and<br>spinal cord<br>so at this point i need to introduce you<br>to non-nerve cells<br>so besides the nerves which are shown<br>here we also have<br>other cells supporting cells like shown<br>here in the old dangerous site<br>and an astrocyte and in this case we<br>were mainly focusing on the<br>and the key result we found was that if<br>you decrease the non-neuronal cell<br>proliferation<br>so the astrocyte proliferation using<br>specific drugs<br>you actually see more regenerating axons<br>and neurites<br>and here's a there's an eem an electron<br>micrograph using a transmission electron<br>microscope<br>from that time from my thesis my phd<br>thesis<br>showing some of the axons now we had to<br>call them neurites because we weren't<br>sure whether they were axons or<br>dendrites<br>based on the anatomy only<br>and here are some examples of astrocytes<br>and this is also quite a high<br>modification just to show you how small<br>so the essential take-home message was<br>that if you decrease the amount of<br>astrocytes you actually get<br>more axons which suggests that the<br>astrocytes are<br>working as a barrier so we published<br>this research<br>in this journal and this is one of the<br>publications that we had<br>so beyond my phd and in my early post<br>i published seven papers from my phd and<br>early postdoc research which was related<br>to my phd research<br>and i published one small book and that<br>was actually the lip review from my phd<br>thesis<br>so that's a perhaps a prompt to you if<br>you're in that situation<br>so phd as you know it's a doctor of<br>philosophy<br>um i also would summarize it as p for<br>perseverance<br>h by arch and h for heart and d<br>for diligence or attention to detail<br>also p for passport um a phd is a<br>passport to academic life and also you<br>need the publications<br>from your phd in order to succeed in<br>the next part of your career but also<br>just in general in academia<br>now at this time i realized that you<br>always should<br>consider the 3d entity that the sections<br>come from<br>so i've shown you sections through the<br>brain but you always need to think about<br>not just the section but the whole<br>structure that it comes from<br>and based on that we uh principle we<br>published this review<br>in progress in neurobiology in 91 and<br>also another one<br>in 1994.<br>so the question arises why is this<br>important to consider this 3d entity<br>so that's shown here in this diagram<br>which actually comes from the second<br>review that i just<br>highlighted so if you look at this<br>diagram if you look at the<br>top here we've got two sections through<br>the brain<br>we're counting the number of cells in<br>the section to get an idea of whether<br>nerve cells are dying<br>in response to injury or not so this is<br>the control condition this is the injury<br>condition<br>and you can see that if you just look at<br>the section you'd say there's less<br>nerve cells here and so it looks like<br>the injury is causing nerve cell death<br>but if you look at this not only the<br>section which is shown here but actually<br>the whole structure that the brain came<br>that the section came from so the whole<br>it looks bigger it could be bigger<br>because there are astrocytes dividing<br>for example<br>and cell proliferation and if you do<br>this calculation here which is the nv<br>times the volume you actually find that<br>the numbers are the same<br>if you do the total amount and so what<br>you learn from this is that actually the<br>way to know whether you've got nerve<br>cell loss or not is actually to do the<br>calculate the absolute number<br>or the total number not just look at the<br>one<br>at this one section and this 3d approach<br>is called stereology<br>and i've used this approach in my<br>research<br>so as it's indicated after my phd i was<br>appointed as an assistant lecturer<br>and then a lecturer in the department of<br>anatomy and at that time you could be<br>appointed as assistant lecturers<br>for my ongoing research i was keen to<br>use real animals<br>now one thing i could have done post phd<br>was continue on things about spinal cord<br>injury<br>but i actually thought that doing a<br>spinal cord injury model would be quite<br>confronting<br>you'd have to actually do a lesion and<br>see animals with<br>paralysis and so on so i decided<br>not to do that and preferred a more<br>covert injury<br>and so i used an established animal<br>model to investigate potential<br>treatments<br>and one particular cause of cerebral<br>palsy is actually low oxygen levels<br>during the equivalent of the third<br>trimester of pregnancy or a term<br>it was known that this can lead to<br>cerebral palsy<br>so in order to investigate this field<br>we know that cerebral palsy involves<br>problems with movement i mean<br>palsy means paralysis cerebrum is<br>the brain so as paralysis due to an<br>injury in the brain<br>but the question is where in the brain<br>is the main injury that leads to<br>cerebral palsy<br>and the answer is this region here the<br>quad butamine or the striatum<br>of the basal ganglia so<br>this is the area that i studied and i'll<br>show you where it is in a moment in this<br>in a image and also the other point to<br>note is that<br>more than 97 of the nerve cells in this<br>structure the chordaptamin<br>are known as medium spiny projection<br>neurons or nerve cells<br>so i studied the codectamine and these<br>nerve cells to see whether they could be<br>rescued<br>after various treatments and so as i've<br>got here we needed to investigate<br>treatments in this brain region<br>the the containment also known as the<br>cpu<br>so where is the cpu as part of the basal<br>ganglia well this there's a diagram here<br>of the rat brain i'm showing you where<br>the cpu is located<br>now it's called the part of the basal<br>ganglia because they're sitting<br>these collections of neurons or nerve<br>cells are sitting at the base of the<br>brain<br>so here's the cpu and our aims<br>my aims for this project first of all<br>were to<br>work out what is the extent of nerve<br>cell loss in the cpu<br>after 1.5 hours of low oxygen levels and<br>once i knew that i could then<br>investigate treatments and also to<br>minimize this loss and see whether we<br>could rescue it to normal levels<br>now to do that i needed to know what is<br>the normal number of cpu nerve cells<br>by that i mean what is the normal number<br>so i looked up the literature and<br>couldn't find it looked up the lipsticks<br>the next day<br>and still couldn't find it something<br>much something with my search engine<br>and after a while i realized you can't<br>find it because it's actually not there<br>so if you want to know what the total<br>number of cells are you're going to have<br>to do it yourself<br>so that's what i did so<br>but in the process i also my reading<br>realized that the basal ganglia has six<br>parts<br>so i thought well if i'm going to<br>do the cpu i might as well do the other<br>parts as well<br>so here are the other parts which i've<br>highlighted here there are six other<br>parts of the basal ganglia<br>and so i had to cut sections through the<br>cpu in the rat to<br>count the nerve cells in them so if i'm<br>going to cut sections through here<br>now i used some methods which are shown<br>here<br>and they were new at the time so i<br>needed to measure the total volume<br>of the structure of the stratum and so i<br>could cut<br>a systematic series of sections through<br>the stratum and then i could use a<br>method known as<br>method or the cavalry method to work out<br>the volume<br>which is what i used and also there was<br>a new method called the optimal sector<br>method where you cut<br>thick sections like 40 to 60 minus 40 to<br>60 micron sections and focused<br>through those sections and counted the<br>cells as you saw them<br>and this is summarized in a review i<br>wrote in 2011 but the methods were<br>available<br>sooner than that so i use these methods<br>so here's an image from a light<br>microscope image showing these<br>nerve cells so this one here and this<br>one here these are the spiny projection<br>nerve cells so we counted them just to<br>highlight<br>that this skull bar here is 10 microns<br>so that's one hundredth of a millimeter<br>which shows you how<br>small these cells are<br>so this is the data they got these are<br>the numbers in<br>these different structures on one side<br>of the brain<br>and this was published in this paper<br>here so as you can see it's called the<br>total number of neurons in those various<br>structures<br>and it's a stereological study using the<br>cavalieri and<br>optical sector methods now<br>this paper had made<br>a big splash i wasn't expecting<br>but it did i got emails from the usa in<br>the uk saying<br>we're really pleased you got that data<br>we wanted that data<br>we need it for our injury models we<br>needed to understand the basal ganglia<br>and how it works in computer models<br>personally i thought wow can you believe<br>it it's 1996 it's almost the year 2000<br>and we don't know the total number of<br>new cells until i've published them<br>in the structures that seems amazing<br>but then when you thought about it it's<br>the year 2000 but actually we only knew<br>about<br>only known about nerve cells for the<br>last 100 years so we only discovered<br>nerve cells as individual entities<br>100 years ago in the 1900s<br>so we've made in terms of the history of<br>the planet<br>that's not a very long time so we've<br>made quite a lot of advances<br>in 100 years but there's still a long<br>way to go<br>in terms of understanding the nervous<br>system as you'll see and based on this<br>publication i was promoted to and others<br>promoted to senior lecturer<br>well what about then this the aim was to<br>investigate treatments<br>to rescue the stratum or the cordoba<br>chamber from low oxygen levels<br>in order to develop treatments<br>potentially for cerebral palsy<br>so i did this work with supervising<br>three phd students<br>listed here so kerry galvin matt kobe<br>and kath hobbs<br>and here they are shown in order so<br>kerry<br>with graduating um<br>graduating and cath graduating with<br>their phds based on<br>looking at this overall theme<br>and what we found overall was that there<br>was nerve cell loss<br>after 1.5 hours of oxygen low oxygen<br>levels<br>so there was nerve cell loss and some of<br>the treatments were effective<br>and some of them were not but because we<br>were using<br>the stereological method or the 3d<br>method we could still get them published<br>because often negative findings<br>are difficult to publish but we're still<br>able to get them published<br>so what do we find well here's an<br>example of one of the treatments that we<br>actually<br>looked at and this particularly it was<br>called an antioxidant<br>hypothermia treatment now at the time<br>hypothermia or cooling was the treatment<br>that was recommended in the clinic based<br>on animal animal work as well<br>but it wasn't completely effective so we<br>added in something else like hypothermia<br>plus<br>and in this case we looked at this<br>antioxidant<br>which actually is like a hype cooling<br>targets a general scheme of the cell<br>death process<br>while the antioxidant targets one<br>particular part of it<br>so it was like a booster in terms of<br>getting a booster amount of antioxidants<br>and i've put this photo in to show you<br>that we not only measured nerve cells<br>but we also<br>measured um motor skills and did<br>behavior in our<br>rats which is one shown here we used<br>white rats for this<br>research and here's a rat which has<br>learnt how to collect sugar pellets<br>which are white here<br>shown from this staircase and what it<br>does<br>is it likes eating the sugar like most<br>of us do<br>so it picks it up and then eats it and<br>we record how many sugar pills it's<br>eaten<br>if it has it's been exposed to low<br>oxygen levels with no treatment<br>it doesn't do so well and that's what's<br>shown down here in this line<br>where we're looking at the mean number<br>of sugar pellets retrieved and eaten<br>and they're not eating as many compared<br>to an energy control<br>which is actually the dotted line here<br>and then when we get the treatment<br>that's the grey line they were<br>performing just as well as to control<br>animals<br>so this showed that this treatment was<br>effective in the in doing the motor<br>skills it also actually was effective<br>in rescuing the stratal neurons which<br>were the spiny projection neurons<br>so that's one example that treatment was<br>given immediately after the low oxygen<br>levels<br>but in the clinic it's often saying we<br>can't actually give the treatment<br>immediately<br>after for logistical reasons so is it<br>possible to look at a delayed onset<br>of treatment instead and so we've looked<br>at this as well<br>looking at delay treatment with adult<br>sourced stem cells<br>like giving these cells one week later<br>so how does this work and what problem<br>are we trying to solve<br>well this also involves not surprisingly<br>the cpu<br>and in response to the injury<br>from low oxygen levels the brain does<br>try to regenerate<br>so the background to this is that the<br>injured brain does try to regenerate in<br>response to the low oxygen levels<br>and to do this it uses its own stem<br>cells<br>which are in this zone here the<br>subventricular zone<br>so within the brain there are stem cells<br>and they're in various regions but this<br>is one of them<br>and what these stem cells do in response<br>to injury is divide<br>and then they migrate into the<br>quadctamen here<br>and differentiate but unfortunately they<br>don't survive<br>so as they've got here the response<br>isn't inadequate<br>so the question arises is it possible to<br>improve this intrinsic response<br>and we investigated this looking at bone<br>marrow derived<br>mesenchymal stem cells and we did this<br>and published this paper and we showed<br>that delayed post treatment with bone<br>marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells<br>is neurorestorative of the striatal<br>spinal protection neurons<br>now you might say how does this work so<br>what we did was<br>the rats were injured they started<br>having the cells proliferating in the<br>svz<br>then we injected into the rats some stem<br>cells from bone marrow to<br>obtain from another rat we injected<br>actually into the abdomen<br>those stem cells go through the<br>bloodstream um to the sites of injury<br>wherever there might be injury so they<br>go into the corticamine<br>they sit here in there and they actually<br>produce lots of nutrients<br>and that's those nutrients keep the<br>cells alive<br>and so the cells now don't die<br>as they did they do normally but they<br>actually stay alive<br>so this is an extrinsic stem cell<br>treatment<br>which is acting on the intrinsic stem<br>now this is the team at the time 2010<br>that actually<br>worked on this particular paper<br>and this is the funding that we received<br>for it<br>so now a summary of potential treatments<br>for cerebral palsy<br>so all the positive findings from my<br>research team are and then consider the<br>most promising promising therapeutic<br>options<br>for trials and human and this was in<br>humans this is from a review<br>in pediatric medicine in 2020.<br>for example the use of stem cells from<br>adult tissue so<br>from not from aborted fetuses for<br>example but from adult source stem cells<br>like bone marrow derived stem cells<br>um the cameron adult paper which i just<br>described has been cited as a basis<br>for a clinical trial that's currently<br>underway<br>and based on this research and other<br>research i was promoted to<br>now at the same time that we're working<br>on this animal model we also were<br>working on another animal model<br>a new animal model which is relevant to<br>extreme prematurity<br>and adhd and memory deficits<br>and this is an image here of a baby born<br>extremely prematurely<br>and that means that we're born in the<br>second trimester of<br>pregnancy and between usually in the<br>humans<br>scale between 22 to 28 weeks of<br>gestation<br>so how do we get to develop this new<br>animal one animal model<br>well i gave a seminar to the<br>pediatricians in the dunedin hospital<br>and that was about the research i just<br>described<br>in the acute basically<br>one an acute hypoxic insult or low<br>oxygen level insult<br>and in response to that seminar one of<br>the pediatricians<br>said to me that was that's really good<br>but you know what<br>most of those children or babies in our<br>newborn intensive care units<br>are actually born extremely prematurely<br>now and they don't actually have the<br>same that brain injury which is relevant<br>to cerebral palsy<br>they have another sort of brain injury<br>and that generates adhd memory deficits<br>so it'd be really good if we could<br>develop an animal model of that brain<br>injury<br>so that we could then develop treatments<br>you could test them and then if they're<br>effective we could take them to the<br>clinic<br>so that person was professor barry<br>taylor and so we worked with barry<br>taylor<br>to create the new animal model and it<br>was funded by the otago medical research<br>foundation<br>at the start which pat is very much<br>involved with and<br>she would have been one of the people on<br>the team deciding to fund this<br>now for this animal model we needed to<br>expose the animals to<br>repeated low oxygen levels<br>and the reason why is because if you're<br>born extremely prematurely that's what<br>happens in newborn intensive care units<br>you actually go into repeated episodes<br>of low oxygen levels<br>even though you're on oxygen monitors<br>and it's thought to be because your<br>brain stem is immature and can't<br>regulate<br>so when we develop after developing<br>uh the the the repeated box here<br>or the repeated low oxygen levels we had<br>to tweak it a bit and try this and try<br>that<br>and then once we had that established we<br>then first of all had to have<br>established that<br>um this animal model uh the the animals<br>that do have adhd like hyperactivity<br>and we tested the rats using the same<br>test that's used in<br>in children to test for adhd like<br>hyperactivity you can use the same<br>paradigm<br>it's children use computers rats use<br>pressing levers<br>but it's the same sort of paradigm and<br>we found that these rats were adhd like<br>hyperactive we then had to characterize<br>the brain injury<br>in these rats and for this i remember<br>this diagram here we<br>had to look at myelin and we had to look<br>at olygeniocytes which produce myelin<br>and the reason why is because that's the<br>main injury that's seen<br>in these babies it's a myelin deficit<br>which is a<br>hallmark of the disease or of the injury<br>and also loss of ologendra sites<br>so was that happening in our animal<br>model<br>so here's a graph which shows the total<br>number of o4 positive preorgan indra<br>sites<br>at personal day four these are the ones<br>which particularly die<br>and we've shown that there were less of<br>them in our animal model<br>which reflected what was seen in the<br>human situation<br>and also we measured myelin and we<br>measured it at post-sale day 14.<br>you can see there's decreased myelin in<br>the repeated<br>hypoxic animals and also decreased<br>myelin in the long term<br>at personnel day 545.<br>so this is two experiments we actually<br>did a total of 11 experiments<br>characterizing various things and we<br>published this<br>paper in the journal of neuroscience<br>which as you can see<br>we found a spectrum of deficits<br>and those deficits actually closely<br>resembled what was seen<br>in human extreme prematurity and because<br>it resembled it so closely that's why we<br>could publish it in this high<br>impact journal and my view about the<br>reason why we could<br>mimic it so closely was because we<br>worked with clinicians<br>to develop the animal model and they<br>knew what parameters we needed to have<br>in our model um to what we needed to<br>mimic<br>now this work was done some of it was<br>done by sarah cohey<br>i mean shown here when she graduated so<br>you can see she's the last author on<br>this paper<br>and for her phd she obtained a<br>distinction<br>so what's happened next with this animal<br>model<br>well this animal this uh these data in<br>this paper<br>from 2013 has leveraged uh<br>three research grants by the new funded<br>by the neurologic foundation of new<br>zealand<br>and what are the topics of those grants<br>well one of them is<br>are there changes in synaptic circuitry<br>which are relevant to adhd<br>so as you can see we've looked at myelin<br>we've also looked at<br>ologendrosites we've actually also<br>looked at nerve cells but i haven't<br>told you about that but the question is<br>are there also synaptic changes<br>we've also got funding to look at<br>deficits for the circuitry for hearing<br>that's because babies born extremely<br>prematurely also have an increased risk<br>of having hearing deficits<br>and we're doing this work in<br>collaboration with megan barclay from<br>university of auckland<br>and then we also got another grant<br>investigating potential treatments which<br>is what we're doing now which is<br>currently underway in my lab<br>we don't have all the data yet so i<br>can't tell you about that<br>but what i can tell you about is the<br>this particular study<br>are there changes in synaptic circuitry<br>so we're looking at brain circuitry here<br>in 88 in an 88 model of adhd<br>but also we're comparing it to a<br>schizophrenia-like<br>now it's hypothesized that adhd could be<br>due to<br>low levels of dopamine in the cpu or in<br>the caudate retainment<br>and that makes sense that's why children<br>are given ritalin which is a stimulant<br>to try and boost the effect of dopamine<br>in the<br>cpu so remember this is the<br>cpu here and how does where does the<br>dopamine come from<br>that's in the cpu well it actually comes<br>from<br>some nerve cell bodies which are sitting<br>over here this is called the forebrain<br>this is in the midbrain<br>and the nerve cell bodies the dopamine<br>nursing is sitting there<br>they send their axons forward<br>and then release dopamine into the cpu<br>so by conversely schizophrenia has<br>decades of evidence of too much dopamine<br>in the cpu<br>and current treatments the<br>antipsychotics actually target specific<br>but there's a caveat with these<br>treatments and that is that they their<br>their main aim is to affect the<br>receptors in this region<br>but those receptors are elsewhere in the<br>brain as well<br>and so they also affect receptors<br>elsewhere in the brain<br>or bind to them and that means we have a<br>main effect<br>in the cpu for these antipsychotics but<br>we also have<br>other effects elsewhere in the brain<br>which are called side effects<br>so we have a main effect plus side<br>effects and because of the side effects<br>they say a lot of people who diagnose<br>schizophrenia<br>don't like taking the antipsychotics and<br>so we have a dilemma that we've got a<br>treatment but actually the people don't<br>like taking it<br>because of the side effects so is there<br>a way forward to minimize<br>the the side effects so in this study<br>we hypothesized that the low levels of<br>dopamine and adhd is that because<br>there's strong<br>synaptic inhibition onto these dopamine<br>nerve cells sitting here so um<br>is there uh this inhibition occurring<br>and we looked i've looked at this<br>anatomically and i'll show you it in a<br>moment<br>and for schizophrenia is it the converse<br>do we have too much dopamine in the cpu<br>because we have weak synaptic inhibition<br>or synaptic imports coming onto these<br>midbrain<br>dopamine nerve cells now if we could<br>show that what that would mean is that<br>rather than giving a drug an<br>anti-psychotic that actually<br>affects all of the brain we could<br>actually just<br>now we've got special ways of actually<br>just targeting<br>these synapses in this part of the brain<br>only<br>and that if we could do that then we<br>would actually more likely to<br>maximize our effect of that treatment<br>and minimize the side effects<br>so to do this work we needed a<br>schizophrenia<br>like animal model so i need to provide<br>the context for this<br>so the context is that a mum has a has<br>the flu during pregnancy which means<br>that she's infected<br>with the influenza virus now her<br>response to that influenza virus<br>can affect the fetus so the immune<br>reaction to that virus<br>can affect the fetus so what we mean is<br>that the chemicals we've produced by the<br>mum in response to the virus can also<br>affect the fetus<br>it doesn't necessarily mean that the<br>virus crosses the placenta to affect the<br>fetus but the chemical reaction<br>can affect the fetus and after birth the<br>fetus has an increased risk of<br>developing<br>schizophrenia now i need to add<br>that there is also a genetic<br>contribution to this risk so it's<br>not necessarily just all infection and<br>exposure to a second stressor also<br>increases risk of developing<br>schizophrenia<br>now scientists have developed an animal<br>model of this situation and it's called<br>the maternal immune activation model<br>where basically they're activating the<br>maternal immune system<br>and they do that by putting in what's<br>called a viral mimic<br>now they're doing this in rats and so<br>what they do is inject a viral<br>mimic into pregnant rats<br>and what they've found for the offspring<br>of those rats is that they have<br>increased dopamine in the cpu which is<br>what's seen in humans as well<br>so you can see that this model um seems<br>relevant to this situation<br>so to do this work this was quite a<br>technically challenging experiment so we<br>needed a team<br>and this is where the team of<br>neuroscientists we have here is really<br>useful<br>so in this team firstly was david bilke<br>who's<br>from department psychology who's um in<br>the background there<br>and also steph hughes from the<br>department of biochemistry<br>and then from the department of anatomy<br>we have louise parr brownlee<br>rachel seismore karen reeder and steve<br>ceo<br>and they all needed to do very technical<br>aspects of this experiment so they<br>all had expertise in different things<br>and put it all together to do this<br>experiment<br>and the person who did the most of the<br>work which was most of the transmission<br>of jean microscopy<br>to analyze the synapses with steve and<br>steve's in the audience as well i just<br>want to acknowledge steve's contribution<br>to this project so<br>this is the what the synapses look like<br>in the electron microscope<br>so with techniques have improved and<br>we're now able to label<br>the inhibitory synaptic input you can<br>see it's dark here<br>and we're also able to label the<br>dopaminergic nerve cell which is this is<br>the label here<br>so what do we find in the adhd versus<br>the schizophrenic like<br>situations well this is the adhd<br>situation<br>and you can see that in terms of the<br>synapse it's bigger here<br>which actually means that it's got more<br>effective<br>inhibition which could explain why<br>there's<br>less dopamine in the adhd like condition<br>by contrast when you looked at the<br>schizophrenia-like situation shown here<br>you can see that the the gabaergic input<br>or the inhibitory input<br>is actually small the synapse is small<br>here as well<br>and these structures correlate and in<br>the literature with function like<br>how big or small the sciences are<br>correlates with how much inhibition<br>there is so these findings actually<br>match exactly what we would predict<br>in this situation you would expect less<br>less inhibition and therefore you'd<br>expect more dopamine<br>in the cpu so we've submitted this paper<br>for publication<br>the schizophrenia like<br>work at this point providing it as<br>evidence for a new way to do targeted<br>therapies<br>for schizophrenia<br>now i also need to add that besides<br>these work i've also worked on the<br>normal<br>circuitry of the cpu so i'll briefly<br>describe that<br>in the other work i've done and then<br>we'll wrap this up<br>so from using marsden funding i've<br>worked with jeff<br>wickens here who looks rather young this<br>is when he was doing his phd<br>and also mark tunstall<br>and in this experiment we actually<br>looked at spine infection neurons to see<br>whether they actually inhibit their<br>neighbours<br>and we actually found that they do and<br>that's important information for<br>models of the basal ganglia also with<br>funding from these<br>agencies we mapped<br>one neuron in one spine infection neuron<br>in the cpu of iraq<br>and asked the question who does it<br>synapse with<br>this is the team that did that so naily<br>lynn<br>myself ben cooper and jeff as well as<br>john reynolds who's in the audience as<br>well<br>and also hawaii sun shown here<br>and we published this paper here about<br>the the connectivity between that filled<br>neuron<br>and who it silences with here's the<br>picture from that<br>paper here's the field neuron shown here<br>you can see it silences with the neurons<br>shown in yellow but it doesn't sign it<br>through the other neurons<br>so you can see the situation is complex<br>this was actually technically<br>challenging research this sort of<br>research like who<br>this is one neuron who does it synapse<br>with we had to cut<br>490 cereal ultra thin sections<br>which those ultra thin sections are one<br>ten thousandths of a millimeter<br>thick so they're challenging to cut and<br>pick up<br>and in my view we need to do this type<br>of research for the next century<br>we need to map who talks to who because<br>we actually<br>lastly just two areas other areas i've<br>worked in on the human brain<br>so i've worked on the alzheimer's brain<br>i did this during a sabbatical at the at<br>nih which is the netherlands institute<br>for his non-desert<br>which means the netherlands institute<br>for brain research and this is in<br>amsterdam<br>and for this i didn't investigate the<br>cpu investigated<br>the another brain region i did this work<br>with dick schwab who was the director of<br>that<br>institute and these are some of the<br>sections we analyzed<br>and essentially for this study we were<br>looking at<br>are particularly stressed neurons do<br>they increase with age<br>and do they increase even more in a with<br>alzheimer's disease<br>and what we found was that they do<br>increase with age but they don't<br>increase<br>any more in alzheimer's disease so if<br>you're feeling more stressed it's<br>because<br>these neurons as you're getting older is<br>because of these neurons<br>but it's not any worse than alzheimer's<br>disease and this is the paper<br>that was published and related to<br>that work and then uh finally in terms<br>of human brain circuits i've worked with<br>hunting and hunting this disease as well<br>with professor richard four and henry<br>warbow will shown here<br>and his uh some of the brain regions<br>that we've investigated in the study<br>and we've in particular investigated the<br>area shown in black<br>and what we've basically shown is that<br>if you have a major injury here in the<br>motor cortex then you have not<br>surprisingly<br>a motor type symptoms and if you have a<br>major injury here in the<br>what's known as a singular cortex which<br>is a mood area then you mainly have a<br>mood symptoms<br>and that paper was published in brain<br>showing as you can see that the<br>cell loss in the motor and the mood<br>areas correlates with the symptomatology<br>but we also found that not only do you<br>have<br>major pockets or focal areas where you<br>get neurocell death<br>but we also have a generalized cell<br>death in these huntington's disease<br>which is similar to alzheimer's disease<br>and that was published in this paper<br>here<br>showing widespread loss across the<br>cerebral cortex in huntington's disease<br>so finally i just want to mention<br>teaching and service so<br>besides doing the research to become a<br>professor you also need to<br>teach well and do service as well so<br>this summarizes what others have already<br>summarized<br>so i won't go through it again but these<br>are the things that i've done<br>in terms of teaching and service<br>then lastly i said thanks so firstly i'd<br>like to thank my family<br>so you can see on the left there's my<br>team of six<br>that's mum dad and the four children in<br>a more recent photo<br>and then on the right is the wider<br>family<br>in terms of spouses and so on and<br>children<br>and most of these people in this photo<br>are actually watching the live stream<br>from perth and i'd like to thank my<br>family for all this support<br>over uh very many years and then lastly<br>i'd like to thank all those who've<br>contributed academically<br>to my journey and these people are shown<br>so my name is lisa madison-smith i am<br>the head of department<br>of anatomy the current head of<br>department of anatomy and it's my job to<br>thank dorothy and to say a few words uh<br>about her amazing ipl tonight<br>but first of all i'd just like to thank<br>you all for coming<br>braving the weather and being here but<br>it's<br>lovely to see so many friends and<br>colleagues<br>um of dorothy's here and i note<br>um made me a little bit nervous when i<br>realized uh<br>we have i think six hods former hods<br>in in the department in the audience<br>tonight so<br>gareth and helen and dorothy<br>and dave and neal<br>we we almost have this this succession<br>we're missing<br>missing a few who aren't in the country<br>but i think that um<br>is is really an indicator of the<br>esteem um that uh<br>and respect that we have for dorothy and<br>everything<br>that she has brought to the department<br>and to the university so um<br>yeah i love i love ipls this is<br>this is one of the the really positive<br>jobs that we get to do nerve wracking<br>but positive jobs that we get to do<br>as a head of department because you you<br>actually um<br>learn so much about your colleagues<br>things that<br>you you know you get to know them and<br>you get to know their research and their<br>contributions and so forth but to<br>to get some of that personal um history<br>i think is such a lovely thing about so<br>many of of the ipls and<br>and being able to to<br>see that of of our colleagues um so<br>again i want to um<br>to thank uh dorothy's mum<br>thank you for encouraging her to stay on<br>in university and not go off and do<br>something else<br>and thank gareth for for bringing<br>dorothy to<br>otago so that we could actually be here<br>tonight<br>uh celebrating um i didn't know that you<br>were an identical twin<br>i think that's amazing and again i think<br>uh ipls are great because there's<br>something in it for everyone<br>uh so i think those first few slides of<br>of dorothy's in this lecture were<br>were for my benefit i'm a biological<br>anthropologist i like understanding<br>migration and history and the basic<br>genetics of<br>yeah you have dark hair but your mom has<br>blonde hair so<br>thank you for those but they're also a<br>wonderful opportunity to<br>demonstrate the amazing research um that<br>our staff do but also<br>to teach it's a you know while it's<br>colleagues and there are a lot of<br>neurologists or neurobiologists and<br>anatomists in<br>in the uh in the audience um<br>they're you know they're pitched at a<br>level that<br>those of us who aren't brain scientists<br>can<br>can also understand so i think we can<br>see you know the amazing teaching skills<br>um that that dorothy has i didn't know<br>what the basal ganglia was before i came<br>to<br>the department of anatomy and to have<br>the explanations and everything<br>um presented tonight always really<br>helped me along the way so thank you for<br>that<br>i think you know certainly when we when<br>we see the impact of dorothy's research<br>it brings out a number of key points to<br>me<br>which are how her meticulous basic<br>science has really contributed<br>so greatly to better outcomes<br>for people so it's this wonderful<br>demonstration<br>of um the value of that that<br>starting with the basic science and<br>moving through to the treatment<br>of of you know serious<br>uh conditions brain injury diseases like<br>schizophrenia<br>like huntington's disease and and<br>personally<br>um i i've been really excited to learn<br>more<br>uh both from the lecture tonight and<br>from the last few months of<br>of talking with with dorothy about her<br>research<br>on adhd and hypoxia because that has a<br>personal<br>uh connection for me with a brother who<br>was born<br>with severe hypoxia and suffered from<br>adhd<br>who i've never been able to really<br>figure out but<br>certainly i mean he's great he's he's<br>healthy now he's<br>graduated from mit he's a he's done very<br>very well<br>but i know the frustration that my<br>family<br>suffered when he was a child<br>and my mother was desperately trying to<br>to find out more<br>about the condition and the treatment<br>this was 60 years ago<br>and so as a family who's been through<br>that i i<br>thank you dorothy for the amazing<br>research that you're doing and<br>the impact that i know that that will<br>have um<br>on on so many um so many families<br>so you know her research is we've seen<br>uh fantastic i've also<br>um being being the current hod<br>have really gotten to know uh dorothy as<br>as a colleague and again in a very large<br>department like anatomy<br>you don't really get those opportunities<br>unless you're in a role<br>like like hid and i've really come to<br>value<br>thoroughness and attention to detail<br>we've certainly heard this<br>but you know you see the the again the<br>the impact of this as a head of<br>department when<br>um it comes to providing me background<br>and notes for<br>for meetings that i need to head into<br>and so forth um but also i've seen<br>the care that dorothy shows in terms of<br>ev everything that she does you know i<br>know that that there<br>that that if i ask dorothy for something<br>the information that i get is gonna be<br>be absolutely spot on but watching the<br>has just you know really<br>because she just demonstrates that she<br>goes above and beyond<br>constantly uh when it comes to to<br>supporting her students and dealing<br>dealing with with her students so i<br>found it i loved her<br>her description of the phd<br>being perseverance heart and<br>attention to detail because that really<br>does<br>completely and thoroughly describe<br>dorothy and i have to say when i when i<br>arrived in 2009<br>uh dorothy was the head of department of<br>anatomy and she<br>she i was i was quite scared of her<br>really<br>she was she was always working she was<br>in the office down the hall from mine<br>and was working till late at night and<br>now that<br>that i'm hod i realize you know what it<br>what a chore<br>uh she she had taken on<br>at that point and what a wonderful job<br>she did um<br>so again thank you for that and<br>the final thing that i get to do is to<br>give you our official thanks and and a<br>celebration and recognition<br>of everything that you've done and<br>congratulate you on<br>this wonderful ipl and thank you<br>akiora<br>my name is paul brunson and i'm the pvc<br>for health sciences<br>i have two duties tonight firstly to<br>thank you for coming<br>the audience for attending this<br>excellent i think you'll all agree<br>lecture that we've heard tonight from<br>dorothy and be you in the audience<br>virtually or physically you're<br>very welcome and thank you for attending<br>my final duty is to invite you all to<br>join us<br>for refreshments in the staff club and<br>we can continue some fellowship<br>and uh congratulate dorothy on a<br>excellent inaugural prophecy lecture so<br>before we depart for refreshments<br>can i ask you to thank dorothy once<br>again in the usual way thank you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
