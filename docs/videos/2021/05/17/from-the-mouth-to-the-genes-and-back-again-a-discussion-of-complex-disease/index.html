What does it mean now, and what can it mean for the future?</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>i would like to invite those of you who<br>would like to do so<br>to join with me in opening this evening<br>and with this kadakia<br>tukuna tawarua<br>the karakia we opened with was gifted to<br>the likings institute<br>by michael stedman ngati fatou orake<br>waipapa tomatoro at the instigation of<br>professor o'sullivan<br>who was responsible for taking that<br>initiative forward<br>my name is frank bluefield i'm director<br>of the lincoln institute and it gives me<br>enormous pleasure to welcome you all<br>here this afternoon<br>to a very special occasion and for<br>professor o'sullivan's<br>inaugural professorial lecture before we<br>start<br>just a few housekeeping please<br>turn your phones off or at least to<br>silent<br>toilets are outside across the atrium<br>and also down the<br>corridor to the right as you go out of<br>the doors at the back there<br>and if there should be an emergency the<br>red lights will flash and water will<br>come out of the ceilings<br>and please leave by the exits at the<br>back there<br>or there are also some emergency exits<br>at the front<br>now the format for an inaugural lecture<br>doesn't include<br>questions and answers at the end but as<br>you all have come in you'll have noticed<br>that people are setting up outside<br>so i'd like to invite you all to join us<br>afterwards<br>and for drinking some nibbles to<br>celebrate um justin's<br>inaugural lecture in addition um the<br>lecture will be recorded and will be<br>so i'd particularly like to welcome you<br>all here again tonight<br>and welcome to the deputy vice<br>chancellor research professor jim metzen<br>to colleagues of justin collaborators<br>not only from the sciences but also from<br>the arts i see that billy apple is here<br>tonight<br>to one of justin's supervisors from his<br>doctoral degree<br>howard jenkinson welcome to justin's<br>students<br>and of course particularly to justin's<br>family<br>to eugene and brenda simon<br>alice james and of course gina a very<br>warm<br>so an inaugural lecture provides a way<br>to celebrate the<br>recognition by the university of the<br>mark of distinction<br>conferred by promotion to professor<br>which is the highest academic rank<br>and tonight of course we're here to<br>celebrate that for professor justin<br>o'sullivan<br>with his lecture from the mouth to the<br>genes and back again<br>a discussion of complex diseases and if<br>you're wondering<br>what that means so am i<br>but i'm sure justin will enlighten us<br>over the course of the next hour<br>now professor o'sullivan has chosen to<br>deliver his lecture in academic<br>regalia and this mode of apparel dates<br>back to the 12th century<br>when all academics were in religious<br>orders and of course<br>the gown comes from the original kappa<br>klauser<br>which was a development of the priestly<br>pluvial<br>the hoods covered the tortured heads of<br>the clergy and for a while in some<br>institutions<br>the way that professors were promoted<br>was the applicant would stand at the<br>front<br>with his back to the rest of the staff<br>and the staff would drop little pieces<br>of paper with an eye or a nay<br>into the hood and then they'd be counted<br>after the person turned round<br>unfortunately i don't think that form of<br>torture has been used at the university<br>of auckland before<br>in the 14th century um the statutes of<br>some of the english colleges for bad<br>excess apparel and prescribed the<br>wearing of long gowns which were closed<br>and they still are in some american<br>university and that was to prevent the<br>display of excessive finery<br>the gown that justin's wearing this<br>evening is the doctoral degree<br>from the university of otago and i think<br>it's a great shame that it's not<br>a closed gown because then it would hide<br>the fact that justin is not wearing a<br>tie<br>the specific details for academic<br>regalia were really introduced at the<br>time of henry viii by the university of<br>cambridge and oxford<br>and most regalia in new zealand are<br>based upon these and but the current<br>convention of<br>specific colors representing areas of<br>study is a much more recent<br>introduction but now of course to turn<br>to<br>professor o'sullivan who joined the<br>institute in 2012<br>from massey university where he was a<br>senior lecturer<br>in the institute of molecular<br>biosciences and prior to that he took a<br>first-class<br>degree bachelor of science in cellular<br>and molecular biology from the<br>university of canterbury canterbury<br>and then a phd from otago university<br>the university of auckland assesses<br>promotion to professor on criteria<br>covering research<br>teaching and service with a key<br>requirement being<br>international reputation and eminence<br>in the field and in my view justin sails<br>over the bar<br>on all of these counts his research is<br>world leading<br>and his original and innovative thinking<br>is reflected in the work he's done on<br>spatial organization<br>regulation of the genome the mapping of<br>regulated genes in polygenic disorders<br>and its investigations into the<br>microbiome is transmission between<br>people whether mother to baby or<br>peer-to-peer<br>and the interaction between the<br>microbiome and the host<br>he has over 90 peer-reviewed<br>publications and a particular notice<br>that these are all<br>in quality journals including nature<br>communications<br>cell nucleic acids research and<br>microbiome<br>and several of his papers have made the<br>front cover<br>he's been highly successful in obtaining<br>research funding from a wide range of<br>organizations including the health<br>research council in new zealand<br>the royal society ministry of business<br>innovation enterprise<br>and international funding such as the<br>michael j fox foundation<br>and he's also received substantial<br>support<br>from philanthropists which reflects his<br>gift for community communicating science<br>with passion<br>but clarity and his ability to enthuse<br>others with his ideas<br>as well as reflecting his world leading<br>research and i'm delighted particularly<br>to welcome<br>some of the philanthropists who<br>supported justin throughout his career<br>here tonight their contribution<br>not only supports the research advances<br>that justin makes<br>but of course their generosity also has<br>played a key role<br>in fostering the success of justin's<br>career<br>justin also is an outstanding academic<br>citizen<br>contributing widely both nationally and<br>internationally in his field<br>and also to the university of auckland<br>his international reputation is<br>reflected in honorary professorships at<br>the university of southampton and the<br>garvin institute<br>in addition to the numerous invitations<br>to speak at international conferences<br>around the world<br>in 2016 justin was appointed associate<br>director<br>research and in 2020 deputy director of<br>the liggins institute<br>these are both large roles requiring<br>substantial commitment<br>and yet justin has maintained his<br>research output<br>and his student supervision he is known<br>around the university for his positive<br>insightful and constructive<br>contributions and his ability to cut to<br>the chase<br>and this is reflected in the fact that<br>it's extremely difficult to persuade<br>committee chairs to let him step down<br>for me personally working with justin in<br>the leadership team of the institute has<br>been<br>hugely enjoyable and a real privilege<br>he has enormous energy and enthusiasm<br>sometimes he laugh enough to leave me<br>feeling utterly exhausted<br>and is a real cauldron of ideas and<br>initiatives<br>i sometimes wonder how he ever gets to<br>sleep at night<br>so i'd like to thank justin for support<br>for me in my role as director as well as<br>a collaborator<br>and for his tremendous contributions to<br>the ligands institute<br>finally of course justin is a<br>superlative supervisor<br>of postgraduate students and i think<br>that he would agree that for him this is<br>the most important contribution he makes<br>to supervising his students and he cares<br>deeply for them<br>and i thought that rather than me<br>telling you about<br>his relationship with his students i<br>would let the students do that<br>for me<br>a versatile leader kind curious<br>intelligent ambitious dynamic<br>ready open-minded quirky<br>busy enthusiastic ambitious<br>protein<br>innovative<br>passionate<br>driven decisive always supportive<br>supportive support supportive supportive<br>energetic you are an inspirational<br>innovative and passionate<br>individuals<br>infectiously enthusiastic and very<br>friendly and inspiring<br>um i want to sit down now and listen to<br>that guy<br>instead you got me uh so i'll do my best<br>um thanks very much for coming um yeah<br>it's a real pleasure to be here talking<br>to you today<br>um it's been a long time coming um but<br>uh they kind of stole my thunder because<br>there's more to me than you see um<br>and so this is me with my daughter who<br>doesn't look like us anymore she's grown<br>up<br>and this is my family and uh so without<br>them<br>you know i wouldn't be me and<br>they support me uh through my trip<br>and it's been really cool so thank you<br>but i am really a face for many<br>and the many people that i'm faces for<br>are these people<br>i'm just the front these are the people<br>who do<br>everything that i'm going to show you<br>and that we've published<br>so these are all the people that have<br>worked with me<br>over the years this is me<br>wearing a hat that billy gave me one<br>christmas<br>which is quite cool i mean these are the<br>other people that support me as well<br>and other people in the institute<br>through the institute<br>and often we forget to recognise the<br>great deal of help that they give us<br>these are all my co-authors and<br>collaborators<br>and i know that i haven't missed anybody<br>out on this list because what i did was<br>i took<br>all hundred papers i got a few more<br>since frank counted<br>um but all hundred papers<br>and i grabbed all of the authors off the<br>list and now i put them in a wordle<br>and so this is everybody and you can see<br>by the sizes<br>uh here these are the size basically<br>says the number of papers that reflects<br>the number of papers i've published with<br>people so<br>people like william have been really<br>essential in my career<br>and william has been working with me now<br>for nearly half of my career<br>it's been amazing thank you but others<br>as well<br>so there's a few other people here who<br>get number of mentions through this talk<br>but also my funders because without<br>funders<br>you know we can't do any of the work<br>that we do<br>and uh it's been amazing uh to get the<br>support that i've got<br>from the funding community um even<br>though i know sometimes my<br>my father says to me he doesn't really<br>understand why we would bother sending<br>grants to our competitors<br>and having them say whether or not we<br>should get funded and it seems kind of a<br>weird thing<br>and in some respects it is but you know<br>that's the way the system works since<br>that's what we do<br>but i would like to thank all of these<br>people and the funding bodies here<br>so my journey started in canterbury<br>because i'm cantabrian many of you will<br>know that because i<br>i support the crusaders very strongly<br>and of course um<br>down to the point that the ribbons i'm<br>going to use later red and black<br>um you know so you have to do it really<br>can't support the other teams<br>but my journey started in canterbury uh<br>with these people so this is barry<br>palmer and this jackie aisle b<br>and they took me on as an honors student<br>way back then<br>um to actually study uh how bacteria<br>degrade<br>diab dibenzothiaphine i actually looked<br>for some images from my<br>from my honest thesis but i i seem to<br>have lost it<br>um i don't think it was that good<br>actually um<br>so i i studied this with them and i got<br>honours<br>and i always remember and barry spoke to<br>me after he said you know<br>he said a few decisions went your way um<br>and that was good because they thought i<br>might be able to do some science<br>that contributed so that was cool and i<br>want to thank them for that<br>and so i got my honours first class in<br>1994<br>and i moved from studying bacteria and<br>how bacteria<br>degrade these chemicals that basically<br>contaminate sites of gas<br>works and petroleum um a work<br>uh and moved on and i moved to the mouth<br>and so this is the beginning<br>of the mouth and so what i did was um<br>i actually got offered a position in<br>medical school and i thought about it<br>but i also got offered a position<br>um in otago at the dental school with<br>these people<br>and so howard jenkinson is here and he<br>was one of my supervisors and richard<br>cannon was my other<br>and brian here he used to advise me<br>about things and it was quite good<br>and i studied in a dental school which<br>is kind of an unusual place<br>to do a phd as some people might think<br>but what i studied there was<br>i actually studied this organism here<br>and this is a yeast and it's some<br>candida albicans<br>and so canda alba cans causes thrush<br>which used to be a real killer at<br>parties<br>but<br>but it was all right you know because i<br>didn't study i studied this form with<br>rush which was<br>the one that divine's in your mouth<br>right and it's a real problem<br>and what i studied with thrush here was<br>about how it actually sticks in your<br>mouth<br>and how it binds to your mouth and so we<br>develop some essays and<br>the essays were kind of cool but<br>basically what we did is we fed<br>the yeast radioactive methionine<br>and it ate it up and it put it into<br>proteins and then we used the yeast<br>basically to bind to salivary proteins<br>and we could see which library proteins<br>are bound to<br>and it was a pretty cool trick really<br>and it gave us some real neat<br>papers and i wanted to show this one<br>mostly for chris because<br>i actually did mass spec work during my<br>phd which is<br>kind of something that slips through um<br>but then when i'd done my phd<br>which was it was amazing journey but<br>when i'd done that i moved back to<br>canterbury<br>um but i didn't move to canterbury and<br>christchurch in canterbury<br>i moved to um canterbury uh in the uk<br>um so i just went all the way around the<br>world just to go back to canterbury<br>unusual but that's what i did and i went<br>there and i worked with uh with mick<br>um and so i applied for this job i<br>remember applying for this job it was<br>it was advertised in nature and so i<br>sent my application in<br>and um i had an interview with him on<br>the phone<br>and i didn't get the job and i said oh<br>well<br>i said that's all right that's it i'm<br>going to come anyway<br>and have a look and just have a look in<br>the uk so i come over and do you mind if<br>i stop off at your lab and have a look<br>and he turned around and he rang me back<br>a few days later he said<br>yeah you've got the job so having never<br>met mick<br>um i remember getting into canterbury i<br>had i had my backpack<br>and and and this and like a little bag<br>um just a duffel bag<br>and i walked in and he was on the stairs<br>and that was the first time i'd ever met<br>him<br>and so it was kind of cool and so with<br>mick i did something different<br>and mick was was really into candid or<br>albicans<br>very very important organism of course<br>but he's also into this the genetic code<br>so the genetic code is the way<br>we read or the way organisms read dna<br>and all of the information we have is<br>stored in our dna well not all of it<br>right but<br>but most of it and the genetic code is<br>this<br>code which is made up of three letters<br>and it's a redundant code and there are<br>no commas there's no things<br>it's just a three-letter code and it's<br>universal<br>well we think it's universal but the<br>reality of it is<br>is that it's not universal in fact even<br>in your own cells<br>mitochondria don't use this code<br>so mitochondria use a different code to<br>what your nuclear<br>cells do or your nuclear not your<br>cellular nucleus does<br>and so in fact there are a number of<br>reassignments<br>in the genetic code whereby the<br>organisms or the particular organs<br>you're looking at<br>uses a different code to what we would<br>consider the universal<br>and most of those reassignments this has<br>the universal code<br>so for example this codon goes for a<br>stop<br>but in this particular organism like a<br>plasma right it encodes a tryptophan<br>and here most of them are either stops<br>to tryptophans or stops to<br>another amino acid or the other way<br>around a few of them are<br>arginine or this is isoleucine sodium<br>methionine or something else<br>arginine to tryptophan but they occur<br>mostly in mitochondria<br>and the reason is mitochondria have very<br>small genomes they don't code for very<br>many proteins right they used to be<br>bacteria<br>but if you change one of these things<br>you've got to think about it<br>it's like going through a book and<br>taking every a<br>in the book or every word the and just<br>replacing it with another word<br>so we went through the book and just<br>took out the and replaced it with sit<br>for example<br>and it would mess up your reading of<br>that book phenomenally<br>so when you change something like this<br>you have a huge impact on the organism<br>it's a real big deal<br>well these ones mostly change stops to<br>something else<br>so that's like replacing your full stop<br>with a word you figure that out pretty<br>quick<br>but candida doesn't candida<br>is a little beasty and what it did was<br>it changed this codon<br>from a leucine to a serine<br>that's a whole reassignment right and<br>you're changing from one type of amino<br>acid to a different type of amino acid<br>completely different properties in every<br>protein<br>in that organism when it made that<br>change<br>it was a huge impact on the organism in<br>fact<br>candid is really weird so it actually<br>did it twice it reassigned it and then<br>it went back<br>and then reassigned it again really<br>weird right massive impact on the<br>organism so this was really important<br>thing to study<br>and so we did this and we studied it and<br>we did some things and we showed that<br>the enzyme the cereal trna synthetase<br>which is the enzyme that actually<br>puts the amino acid on this molecule<br>trna what reads<br>reads as part of the reading mechanism<br>that that wasn't responsible<br>then in fact what was responsible was<br>actually a change in the structure<br>of the trna molecule itself which is<br>really<br>really cool so we did that there<br>but then after about three years uh make<br>it had enough of me<br>and so i left and i left there<br>and i was quite interested in dna and i<br>was looking for a job<br>and so i went around a couple places i<br>went up to manchester<br>um but i'd always wanted to go to oxford<br>and i got<br>offered an interview with a guy in<br>oxford nick proudfoot<br>and nick worked in the sir william dunn<br>school of pathology<br>a really really really great man um and<br>he taught me a lot<br>now and nick was quite famous and he<br>always gave me a hard time<br>because he sequenced a piece of dna just<br>a little piece of dna so during his phd<br>he sequenced a piece of dna and he<br>always used to hassle me<br>because i just seen my dna for<br>sequencing and he used to hassle me that<br>you're not a real scientist<br>until you've sequenced it yourself and<br>done it on a gel and run it out and<br>counted the bands and stuff<br>so when i finally sequenced an entire<br>organism<br>i wrote back to him and said i haven't<br>done it<br>by doing it in a gel but i have<br>sequenced this organism 20 times he<br>never said anything<br>yeah but uh but nick so he's really good<br>so nick was really interested in<br>transcription and then controlling<br>transcription<br>and so while i was there this is a<br>photograph from my lab book<br>um we were working<br>on just just to show that the people in<br>my lab that i actually did do work in<br>the lab once<br>we were working on trying to understand<br>how transcription occurs that's the<br>process of reading a gene right<br>actually going along and the enzyme goes<br>along and reads the gene<br>and produces a molecule that goes out of<br>the nucleus and it gets translated<br>so we were designing this assay which<br>was a really long gene and yeast this<br>big gene here and it's<br>like 8 000 base pieces long it's huge um<br>in yeast<br>and i was running these assays again<br>focused on<br>radioactive stuff right and we were<br>looking at this and i was looking at<br>these things and<br>when you get used to reading these which<br>you won't in the two seconds you're<br>going to see it<br>you realize that the enzyme peaks in the<br>middle and towards the end of the gene<br>and that was cool but one day nick and i<br>were sitting there<br>i was sitting here he was standing<br>behind me and we were looking at this<br>one<br>and this one here is really interesting<br>you have to believe me<br>this one's interesting because the<br>situation here on the left<br>is doing something completely wrong the<br>one on the left shouldn't have signal<br>across it at all<br>and it shouldn't have signal at the end<br>and the end and that's what it does<br>so we were sitting there and i was<br>thinking well this is wrong<br>and nick said well he likes to say he<br>said<br>but he said what if the two ends have<br>come together and it's looped<br>and that was that and so in fact we went<br>on and we showed<br>that in fact in this particular<br>situation<br>the gene forms a loop and that was<br>really the beginning<br>of the journey that i've been on ever<br>since because<br>after that point we got interested in<br>how dna forms the structures inside<br>cells when it loops what it interacts<br>with<br>and what that actually means in terms of<br>how it works because the information in<br>dna<br>is not just held in the sequence of<br>adenines and thymines and cytosines and<br>guanines<br>the atcg that we all know it's held also<br>in the structure of it the<br>three-dimensional structure the way it<br>folds the way it changes<br>and this is where that came from and so<br>this is um i think still my<br>most cited paper um<br>and it's really cool although one<br>brook's done recently<br>but then i got the chance to come home<br>back to new zealand and i had a young<br>family<br>at this point gina had finally said that<br>she'd marry me<br>um so you know we did and we came home<br>with our daughter<br>and we came back and i got a job here at<br>massey university<br>in albany which is you know it's just<br>over the road here right well not over<br>the road but<br>over the bridge and a little way up the<br>worry and so i got a job there<br>uh and dave lambert and pat sullivan um<br>hired me to go in there pat's just<br>coming here actually yeah thank you<br>and um pack home and and they hired me<br>and they took me into<br>this job at massey not not in this nice<br>building mind<br>um and this one yeah yeah it wasn't it<br>wasn't<br>that good so i went in here and so i got<br>taken into this building<br>and which is a really cool lab actually<br>at the time and we set up a lab<br>and we started working there and so<br>while i was there i was influenced a lot<br>by<br>a number of other people i don't know if<br>they're here but<br>barry scott grant guilford and gavin<br>martin<br>one day um gavin set me down and he said<br>to me justin you said it's not just<br>about big papers he said<br>you have to publish other papers as well<br>don't just go for the really big ones<br>publish consistently and that was the<br>lesson<br>that he gave me i do thank him for that<br>um<br>but while i was there i started working<br>on looping<br>and i'll show you that in a second and<br>as i did<br>i met a couple of very long term<br>collaborators i'm julie horsfield who's<br>from otago and austin gamla who's<br>sitting up the back here as well who's<br>now at<br>sbs so while i was there<br>i'd just come back from oxford<br>i thought everything was great i started<br>doing some work and i went into a period<br>where i<br>had a few years where i didn't publish<br>anything and and that was pretty hard<br>but during that time what i did do was i<br>set up a project<br>i'm with austin's help which we called<br>the cartoon metagenomics project<br>which was for schools and so we went out<br>to schools<br>and we had them basically sample soil<br>across new zealand and in their<br>backyards and all over the place<br>and actually extract dna from it and do<br>metagenomics or<br>actually it was 16 years amphicon<br>sequencing but look at the bacteria that<br>were present<br>in the soil across new zealand and we<br>got the kids to do it<br>and this is one of the first real sort<br>of dna sequencing projects that kids did<br>and it was really cool it was a really<br>great project and it ran for for several<br>years and<br>about a thousand kids went through that<br>program and it was supported by<br>various charities it was awesome um<br>but i also i got my first marsden grant<br>and um i got that the year i came<br>actually which was pretty cool<br>and it was a fast start grunt and so<br>i'll show you<br>some of it um the grant i think<br>was pretty well written uh i like to<br>think that you know<br>but it had this cool figure in it it was<br>about dna<br>looping and the really bright idea we<br>had was um<br>to study the looping of the ribosomal<br>dna and ribosomes really important right<br>it<br>reads things that's how proteins are<br>made but the dna for it's kind of<br>complicated because it<br>exists in these big arrays of jeans<br>about 200 in a row<br>well i ignored that and i thought well<br>i'll draw this cool picture<br>and it will show the repeats and then<br>i'll draw this one about how it might<br>loop up<br>inside the cell and that's nice and then<br>this one here about how i'm going to<br>study it which is a method that we<br>actually use which is<br>kind of cool so that worked and this one<br>about what we think is going on<br>i got given the money and then whoops<br>it didn't work um yeah<br>because i forgot the fact that the dna<br>is arranged in this massive array<br>and that makes it really hard to study<br>by this method because all of the<br>different ones are very very similar<br>and so you couldn't really do it but<br>what it did do was it led me to this<br>and so this little kid if you were to<br>take this kid<br>not that you can and blend them up and<br>take all of their dna out<br>and extract it all right then the dna<br>from this child would go from the earth<br>to the sun and back<br>if you lined it all up end to end 133<br>times<br>that's how much dna there isn't right<br>it'd be pretty small you still wouldn't<br>be able to see the thickness of it but<br>it would get there and back 133 times<br>and that's a lot of dna<br>there's two meters of dna inside every<br>one of your cells except for the<br>sort of 70 percent of your cells are red<br>blood cells because they don't have any<br>but the other cells they do two meters<br>of dna<br>and that dna is squished and folded and<br>packed into those nuclei and when it<br>does that<br>it still has to be readable and<br>accessible the information in it has got<br>to come out<br>and so this led us to this<br>it's a pretty simple concept right he's<br>two meters tall<br>and if you watch and don't cringe too<br>much<br>and that's what your dna does but even<br>more than that right because the cell<br>that the dna packs into he's about two<br>meters tall<br>the cell the dna packs into us you can't<br>even see it right<br>so imagine that you know and doing this<br>it's it's just phenomenal and so<br>you know it takes a lot of bending and<br>twisting<br>a lot of folding to get inside this<br>cell right and eventually he'll get<br>there<br>yeah i've seen it before yeah so<br>here we go he's got to do something<br>and there you go and so you squash it in<br>so you're squashing your dna into a cell<br>just like that right imagine that<br>the impact is amazing so we worked out a<br>method to do this<br>and the method that we worked out to do<br>it is really very simple and i'll<br>illustrate it to you now<br>very quickly so if you have two<br>chromosomes<br>and you're from canterbury and one's red<br>and one's black and those two<br>chromosomes they contact themselves at<br>some point here like this so that<br>there's actually a complex holding them<br>together okay well<br>there's a way that you can take<br>chemicals in this case the ball clip<br>and put it and it will join them<br>together so they can't be separated<br>okay physically they are covalently<br>linked right can't separate them<br>then what you can do is you can rip all<br>the dna out of the cell<br>and you can take scissors molecular<br>scissors right<br>you can take them and you cut the dna up<br>and when you cut the dna up apparently i<br>have to clean up after myself so i'm<br>only going to cut it twice<br>when you cut the dna up right these bits<br>stay stuck together okay they can't move<br>away from each other<br>because they are physically bound but<br>the cool trick is that there's another<br>enzyme which is called<br>a ligase and its job is to actually<br>stick dna back together<br>so you put the dna ligase in and it<br>joins the ends<br>uh i should join these sometimes it does<br>oh that's not good it's a it's a cheap<br>uh the staples are bending yeah<br>okay let me do it another way<br>okay so the stapler has done this okay<br>um<br>and what you do then is you remove the<br>complex that's holding it together<br>and so when the complex that's holding<br>it together goes away the ligase has<br>joined it<br>so that the red chromosome now is joined<br>directly to the black one<br>all right and what we can do is we can<br>then do sequencing<br>and we just sequence from here across<br>here and when we do that of course the<br>sequence changes from being on the black<br>chromosome<br>to all of a sudden being on the red<br>chromosome at a junction a restriction<br>enzyme site<br>that we know we cut at and that means<br>that the red chromosome and the black<br>chromosome at those points or those two<br>restriction fragments<br>must have been physically together in<br>space<br>right and that's it it's really simple<br>because<br>you can do it with ribbons and it does<br>and it works a treat<br>now if you do that in yeast you get this<br>complex mix like this right<br>and this shows all of the interactions<br>that are occurring between the different<br>chromosomes<br>for the yeast all right and it's really<br>cool and this was a great paper that was<br>done by chris<br>and geared here and they did this paper<br>with me way back then<br>it was nice but the point of this is<br>this<br>if you get away from that sort of spider<br>web drawing that i showed you<br>and you think about it like this and<br>you've got two chromosomes and you have<br>some sites on those two chromosomes<br>and you squash those chromosomes up so<br>they fit inside the cell<br>and then you take that and cut that open<br>what actually happens is<br>that those sites that you had that you<br>thought were separate<br>can come together in three dimensions<br>and so<br>the spider web that i showed you is kind<br>of useful in some ways<br>but you really need to think about it<br>like this because now<br>you see these chromosomes here or these<br>regions of these chromosomes<br>are all contacting this particular<br>element<br>despite the fact that their element<br>wasn't on each part of those chromosomes<br>you see what i mean and that's the key<br>because if you understand that you can<br>start to understand how things are<br>working<br>inside the nucleus so<br>we did another paper room this is<br>tatiana and she said some nice things<br>about me<br>on the video was just very very nice of<br>her<br>but um here she is and what she did was<br>she made these models<br>and she actually showed that where<br>things are matters and so these are<br>where the origins of replication are<br>inside a different yeast this is a<br>fission yeast and so it shows that these<br>ones that shoot<br>or these are origins of replication so<br>it's a point where the dna starts to<br>replicate<br>and the ones that work all the time are<br>in the center the ones that don't work<br>are out towards the edges<br>and in fact there's other things about<br>the efficiency but i won't go into that<br>and she showed that where things were<br>actually does matter<br>and this is really important as a the<br>first one to show that<br>and there's a really nice paper and we<br>even it's i'm very proud of this one too<br>because<br>it's the only paper i have where i<br>published with a nobel laureate<br>as one of the minor authors which was<br>really cool<br>and so we figured that out and that was<br>cool<br>but we also realized that what we were<br>capturing was actually a composite of<br>structure<br>and the easy way to show that is this<br>right each cell that we were capturing<br>something from<br>was in a bulk culture and it's like<br>watching a game of rugby<br>so ma'am here he was in this stance at<br>the beginning of the co<br>of the game he was in this stance during<br>the game<br>uh just passing the ball here uh he is<br>trying to fend off an englishman which<br>is good<br>and here is scoring a try right in each<br>of those points he's in a different<br>stance<br>a different phase of the game and the<br>models that we were doing and the things<br>that we were capturing captured all of<br>those things<br>and all of those structures so in fact<br>what they were capturing was the essence<br>of ma<br>but is this which meant that the<br>structure we were getting<br>is this now i'm pretty sure in all the<br>games i saw<br>never existed in that one particular<br>confirmation<br>and so we had to realize that and move<br>on and so we did<br>and so one day i was sitting in my<br>office at massey<br>um i had a little office there you know<br>it was cool um<br>i was sitting there and i got this phone<br>call and uh<br>the phone call was wayne and wayne said<br>um<br>do you want to come and have a cup of<br>coffee and have a chat about a job<br>and i said yeah sure um so i borrowed<br>the messy car<br>and i drove and i drove to the coffee<br>shop and<br>i had a chat with wayne uh and that was<br>cool it could you know it was nice to<br>talk to wayne<br>and then i had an interview with the<br>rest of the institute at a point which<br>was<br>but it was great right and so i i got<br>the job which is really cool<br>and so i came here and all of these<br>people um i've<br>had a lot of work that i've done with<br>these people at the institute<br>and they've all been really great help<br>to me um over the time i've been here so<br>thank you<br>but since i came to the institute i<br>focused on two things<br>uh one thing was a spatial dna structure<br>that i've been talking about<br>and the second thing is the microbiome<br>and so it's kind of going back<br>but one thing and i'll just show you<br>very quickly because this is kind of a<br>bit of a sideline but<br>is interesting was that a few years back<br>i don't know how long it was now but um<br>we were interested in mitochondria<br>and uh jack black uh he<br>is actually the the the face of the<br>mitochondrial<br>uh charity so he supports mitochondrial<br>charity and he was coming to new zealand<br>um to do a concert and so we thought<br>that'd be cool let's see if we can meet<br>jack black<br>and so we made a little story about<br>mitochondria<br>and what it was is basically<br>mitochondria are their own little<br>organelles are the powerhouses of your<br>cell right<br>and they sit in the cell they make all<br>this energy and they do all these other<br>things too<br>but we showed that they communicate with<br>the nucleus<br>by dna and you can think about it like<br>this it's like having<br>a band split between two places and of<br>course it was<br>tenacious d were coming and so we<br>thought oh yeah we'll split it up so<br>we set it up like this so part of the<br>band isn't here<br>even though tenacious d didn't have a<br>guitar a a pianist<br>and a drummer and we put jack black in<br>the mitochondria and so we said well<br>look you know if they're here and<br>they'll plan their own tune<br>it doesn't work very well right you<br>really need a conductor<br>and so it goes back to that movie the<br>school of rock which jack black was in<br>so he said well he's he's like the<br>conductor so the mitochondria is the<br>conductor which was what we were<br>thinking<br>so if it's all working then the cell's<br>happy and the music's good<br>and that's cool if it's not<br>and everyone's playing their own tune<br>it's a bit of a raucous mess right<br>and it is and the cell dies<br>but if one of them goes off on their own<br>then you end up with something like this<br>right<br>where basically you've got someone doing<br>their own thing and again the sale<br>proliferates<br>but it doesn't work so we made that<br>little powerpoint and we sent it to jack<br>black<br>and he sent us back tickets so we went<br>and had to deal with them after the<br>match<br>which was really cool so that was<br>actually yeah one of the most memorable<br>things<br>um so our goal of course<br>wasn't just to meet jack black but it<br>was to use dna sequencing and it is to<br>use dna sequencing<br>to move from a genetic association<br>to pathway-based understanding of<br>complex disease we want to understand<br>why the variants that we all have<br>and how the variants that we all have<br>put us at risk<br>of developing complex diseases now<br>it sounds like a simple question and for<br>years<br>people have been studying this question<br>and the way they've studied it is by<br>doing genome-wide association studies<br>and it sounds complicated but i'll<br>explain it very simply<br>if you take a population in this case<br>there's a population of ladies<br>and some of them are wearing brown capes<br>and others aren't<br>okay and the brown cape is the phenotype<br>but if we take this population of people<br>and we split them into the group that<br>don't have the capes<br>and the group that do have the capes<br>then<br>we've separated them according to the<br>phenotype what we can do then is we can<br>sequence their dna<br>or parts of their dna and if we sequence<br>their dna what we find<br>that this group have a particular base<br>at this position<br>so here they generally have an a at this<br>position in their dna<br>whereas this group down here with the<br>brown capes they have a t<br>in their dna at this position exactly<br>the same position but the a is changed<br>to a t<br>so that means that the t is associated<br>with wearing the brown cape<br>if you think about it really simply okay<br>and that's called a genome-wide<br>association study<br>now these sorts of studies have been<br>done for a huge number of complex<br>diseases<br>all right and that's real cool because<br>over time<br>we've come to understand the positions<br>in the genome<br>where changes are actually associated<br>with disease in fact this is it<br>all right and if you watch the graph<br>you'll see the huge number of positions<br>that are associated with these disorders<br>different disorders right now when you<br>look at it like this it doesn't mean<br>anything<br>all right it's just impressive that<br>but what we're trying to do is<br>understand what each one of those spots<br>does and how it actually links to a<br>disease<br>the easiest thing would be if it was<br>each one of those mutations or changes<br>was present in a gene<br>that would be simple right because then<br>it's inactivating the gene<br>when you inactivate the gene you cause<br>the disease right it's a very<br>deterministic way of thinking about it<br>but that would be it very very simple<br>unfortunately<br>93 of them don't fall inside genes in<br>fact they fall inside<br>what used to be called junk dna right<br>people don't like that term<br>neither die much but it's a term that a<br>lot of people understand<br>not inside the genes but in the in the<br>rest of the dna<br>and if it's not in a gene what's it<br>doing<br>and so what we've done and william and<br>others have been very critical in this<br>is we've studied a toy<br>and so this toy here is a pitch switch<br>ball right<br>and so what it does is well it's a ball<br>um unless oh i didn't do it<br>i throw it and then it opens and<br>re-folds<br>exactly the same material just a<br>different conformation and now it's a<br>different colored ball right<br>and your dna can do that but when it<br>does that in different cells<br>you go from a green cell to an orange<br>cell just for simple like a liver cell<br>to a brain cell or something else<br>when it does that it brings particular<br>points into contact with genes<br>as i showed you with the plasticine<br>bringing those points into contact means<br>that they can act to regulate the genes<br>that they are<br>physically associated with in space so<br>in this confirmation<br>this controls these three genes but when<br>i flip it<br>it doesn't now this one's controlling<br>these three genes okay<br>real simple so<br>we figured out that this might be the<br>case<br>that in fact well other people did too<br>but but we did<br>um but we showed that some of the<br>mutations these disease associated<br>mutations<br>actually fall in regions that act as<br>switches for genes<br>and the way those switches work is you<br>bring them in contact with the gene<br>they're going to turn on<br>okay and that's really cool because it<br>works like this<br>and so this is how it works very simply<br>right<br>when you bring something into contact it<br>either turns the gene on<br>in this case it's turning it off right<br>and stopping its function<br>very nice very simple so we moved to<br>understand that and the example i'll<br>show you is this so this is<br>a gene called glucocerebrosidase it's a<br>gene sorry it encodes the glucose<br>reprosidase<br>and this is a very important enzyme in<br>your brain<br>and it's linked to idiopathic<br>parkinson's disease<br>all right and gaucher's disease very<br>horrible disorders<br>that that yeah we just hope we don't get<br>this gene uh here is the one that's<br>thought to be the culprit and what we<br>did is<br>what sophie sorry and william did all<br>right william lead this one but<br>what william and sophie did is they ran<br>across this gene<br>here and they took every common genetic<br>variant in this region and they asked<br>what do those common genetic variants<br>contact in three dimensions okay so what<br>do they contact<br>is it a gene and do they actually change<br>the expression<br>of that gene turn it on or do they turn<br>it off<br>and they did that for these and they<br>found that hey look there's a whole lot<br>of regions across here that do<br>that control different genes not just<br>the gene that they're sitting in gba and<br>not just the genes next to it<br>but genes that are on other chromosomes<br>in your dna<br>a lot of interesting things about these<br>genes a lot of pathways that they're<br>involved in that actually link to<br>parkinson's disease<br>so we think that gba is acting like a<br>central regulator<br>for parkinson's that has a whole lot of<br>things it's doing that can modify<br>the onset of parkinson's disease and in<br>fact what we showed and what<br>william and sophie showed very nicely uh<br>with martin kennedy and this is anthony<br>cooper who's at the garden<br>our collaborators what they showed<br>beautifully is this<br>that if you separate according to the<br>number of types of switch you have<br>okay this switch here works all right<br>and we have two copies of this switch in<br>this particular thing<br>this one here we have two copies of the<br>broken switch i should have put that<br>there<br>here this is your age at diagnosis all<br>right so 67 years of diagnosis<br>if you have the broken switch 61 years<br>of diagnosis<br>if you have the active switch all right<br>that's a big deal<br>age of onset for the parkinson's again<br>shows the same pattern<br>and this is really important okay this<br>is called a dosage thing because this<br>one's a heterozygote okay so it's a<br>dosage relationship<br>and so basically what this is showing is<br>this that when we have this one<br>we're flicking the switch and we're<br>controlling these other genes even<br>though<br>these particular mutations are not<br>inside<br>the gene itself they're in the junk dna<br>if you want to call it that<br>not that i would but it's easy which is<br>a problem with it<br>but if you've broken the switch or a<br>component of the switch which is what<br>we're talking about<br>then when you bring that into 3d with<br>the gene you're trying to control<br>doesn't work right because imagine<br>turning a switch on with that finger<br>and so sophie has gone further than this<br>and she's actually taken a piece of the<br>dna<br>and she's put it in an artificial<br>construct to show that in fact<br>when we have the proper switch we get a<br>lot of<br>this is just basically light so this<br>assay<br>measures and generates a whole lot of<br>light you get a whole lot of light when<br>you've got this switch<br>when you've got that switch you don't<br>get so much light because it's pretty<br>painful to turn it on<br>and so it's really important because it<br>means that there's something going on<br>here<br>and we don't really understand this yet<br>because we<br>yeah we don't but we know that it's to<br>do with a switch we're just trying to<br>figure out what's going on<br>what it's controlling where it's<br>important and that works on going<br>but what we do know is that this<br>replicates across cohorts<br>and one of the important things about<br>that is this is a dutch cohort<br>and here we have the broken switch again<br>and you see it's exactly the same<br>pattern<br>and here we have the good switch so good<br>switch means you get parkinson's early<br>bats which means you don't<br>and if you conglomerate the data okay so<br>that means if we mix data sources<br>from people who are diagnosed in by<br>normal clinicians or people who are<br>diagnosed by movement specialist<br>disorder clinicians if we take those<br>different cohorts and we mix it all<br>together<br>then you end up with a relationship on<br>the right okay and here you'll see<br>that's not the same okay and that's<br>because people are diagnosing things<br>that they think of parkinson's<br>or a version of parkinson's is a<br>different version of parkinson's and<br>it's mixing it up<br>and we don't see this relationship so<br>it's very important how you do that<br>okay but we think that basically<br>everybody we all have millions of<br>mutations in our dna okay those millions<br>of mutations there's millions of<br>differences between you<br>and me and everybody in this room put us<br>all at risk of developing a genetic<br>disorder<br>and just how much just depends on how<br>many of those changes you've got and<br>what they're affecting<br>but there's going to be an environmental<br>figure and a trigger sorry and it's<br>going to affect the development<br>of the disease okay<br>so daniel has been working on this for<br>parkinson's and this is<br>another really interesting thing and<br>he's been able to use some machine<br>learning<br>to actually talk about and look at which<br>tissues might be important for the<br>development of parkinson's<br>so you would think that tissues are<br>important for parkinson's development<br>would be the brain<br>pretty straightforward right in fact<br>it's not it's the heart<br>here this is the top ranking ones a<br>piece of the heart<br>that people actually often cut out um<br>during some surgeries because if you cut<br>it out it stops you having<br>atrial fibrillation it stops your blood<br>pressure going up and down<br>well actually that piece of your heart<br>is really important we think<br>for parkinson's but we don't know how<br>so these contacts that we have<br>some of these contacts that we have can<br>have very delayed effects<br>all right i'm sure that ruben wiki<br>wishes that this picture never existed<br>and that's what's happening so we we<br>know that the effects are very much<br>dependent on the time<br>when they occur and these switches are<br>working okay and so eugenia has been<br>doing this for autism<br>and she's shown that there's a whole lot<br>of genes that change and that are<br>related to autism in the fetus<br>very very few or many fewer uh in the<br>brain and<br>adults and that there are some here that<br>are actually the same in the fetus and<br>the adult<br>and these ones here and these ones in<br>black they actually do something weird<br>because<br>the switch works to turn the gene on and<br>the fetus<br>and turn the gene off in the adult and<br>that's pretty cool<br>but we don't understand that much either<br>but we do know<br>is that genes and the proteins they<br>encode work in<br>pathways and that if you mess up a<br>pathway just like the lights and that<br>you can't see down the tunnel right if<br>you break a light in the middle of the<br>tunnel you can't see to the end<br>and so we know that now what we've been<br>doing and trying to do<br>is understand how variants work together<br>because if the variants have these<br>impacts on genes<br>and they put them in pathways then<br>basically what will happen<br>is we go through either a pathway which<br>is specific to anxiety and gives you<br>anxiety specific effects<br>or one which is specific to<br>schizophrenia and gives you<br>schizophrenia effects<br>but there will be some changes that<br>actually cause shared pathways<br>and are affecting the same pathways and<br>these are working together<br>and these ones we think give the shared<br>characteristics of these disorders which<br>occur<br>together and so this is to show<br>that and this is beautiful work by<br>shrimal and basically what this shows<br>this is actually about<br>aging and grip strength and so all of<br>these ones that are colored here<br>are affected by one of these different<br>disorders it's either grip strength with<br>aging<br>because when you get past 40 basically<br>you start losing muscle mass<br>and you start losing grip strength about<br>10 per decade<br>unless you keep using it and even then<br>you keep losing it<br>um and that's there but there are<br>genetic variants that are associated<br>with the rate at which you lose your<br>strength<br>myasthenia gravis multiple sclerosis and<br>myotrophic lateral sclerosis all right<br>these are the colors<br>and they affect genes across us but the<br>unfortunate thing is that if you have<br>all of these ones in purple that are<br>linked to grip strength<br>and then you happen to have the multiple<br>sclerosis ones that target here<br>then effectively you really mess up this<br>part of your pathway<br>this part down here you don't affect so<br>badly but this part you really mess up<br>and so understanding this and the<br>relationship between these we think is<br>very very important<br>so what we don't want to do is treat<br>people as if one person<br>is the same as everybody else we don't<br>squish everyone into a box so we really<br>want to move to understanding things<br>from a personal perspective because we<br>can sequence everybody's genomes<br>now we can do it reasonably cheaply so<br>tayasa<br>nick and rowan here are all starting to<br>do this on different disorders<br>parkinson's rhone's sorry<br>nick is doing several and rowan is doing<br>asthma<br>but just in the last few minutes<br>apparently i'm allowed to speak for as<br>long as i want<br>but um but i won't<br>in the last few minutes i've got to talk<br>about the microbiome because it's been<br>an amazing trip<br>so we have many genomes we're not just<br>the genomes i've talked about<br>you know we have about 23 000 genes<br>ourselves<br>but microbial genes we have about 2<br>million<br>that's 43 human okay most of you is not<br>human<br>most of you lives in here and this is<br>someone's actual gut<br>and so most of you lives in here and in<br>fact in this part here<br>through here about one to two kilograms<br>approximately the same size as your<br>liver of that is microbial<br>mass bacteria protozoa various other<br>organisms<br>and they live there and it's not a case<br>of us and them<br>okay for a long time we thought it was<br>us and them and there's a competition<br>between us and them<br>but in fact if you don't have these<br>bacteria in your gut<br>your gut doesn't develop properly if you<br>don't have it in your gut and you<br>for example you have a mouse that<br>doesn't have any bacteria in it and you<br>can create those you<br>stick them in a bubble and then you<br>breed them and you treat them very<br>specially<br>but if you do that they have very very<br>weird gut structures<br>all right and they have a lot of immune<br>inflammation and things that are<br>happening<br>because they're used to interacting with<br>the bacteria<br>that they have in their stomachs we are<br>used to it we have evolved with these<br>bacteria<br>and it's important for us for our health<br>well-being longevity all these things<br>so it's not us and them but it should be<br>more this sort of interaction<br>and so there's a lot of different ones<br>and we're interested in various aspects<br>of these and<br>you know tommy's is really focusing on<br>these fargs here<br>and bits and pieces but wayne and i<br>started working on this<br>some time ago and so we started out<br>thinking about how early life events<br>affect the development of the microbiome<br>and<br>it was really simple because we think<br>that changes that occur when you're born<br>in the microbiome when you're born maybe<br>they affect you when you're a bit older<br>in childhood<br>so we got a cohort together of children<br>who had been born at less than 32 weeks<br>gestation<br>um so very early pre-team children and<br>compared those to children who'd been<br>born a term<br>that we didn't do it when they were born<br>we did it when about eight years of age<br>okay and walking around in the community<br>and these kids we showed<br>and tommy and fellini showed really<br>beautifully<br>are actually different not the bacteria<br>but the little viruses that live on the<br>bacteria the kids who were born preterm<br>and who went through<br>the whole neonatal intensive care unit<br>had way fewer bacteriophage in their<br>system<br>way fewer bacterial viruses in their<br>system than the kids who didn't<br>this is eight years after they were born<br>this is pretty important we don't really<br>understand it yet but what we think<br>might be happening<br>now this figure was drawn by my daughter<br>actually which is really cool<br>but what we think is happening is that<br>when they're born<br>because they're kept in this kind of<br>environment a special environment right<br>to keep them alive which is<br>amazing but because they're in that<br>environment they're not getting enough<br>microbes and so the fars that they're<br>exposed to just go through because<br>there's nothing for them to live in<br>and so the farge when the virus is<br>basically their population level crashes<br>because they don't have the prey to prey<br>on it's like if you had a<br>a a park full of lions and there were no<br>gazelles in there<br>right well the lion population is going<br>to crash because it can't eat the<br>gazelles<br>right same deal the viruses are going<br>into the system<br>there's no bacteria nothing for them to<br>eat their population crashes<br>and then that's what we think but we'll<br>probably be wrong<br>maybe one day we'll find out um and this<br>is<br>what we did at the same time so fellaini<br>did this and this is with billy uh this<br>is great<br>and so with billy billy kept an artwork<br>um<br>and in this artwork billy had a sample<br>uh stored from 40 years ago of his<br>morning stall and you know nobody else<br>has done that and kept that it's it's<br>quite remarkable<br>um all this time that billy's done that<br>and so billy was kind enough<br>to let us sample that and compare it to<br>what we find<br>from current day samples and so what we<br>did is we did that and we extracted that<br>and uh this is it compared here and so<br>these three samples here are billy<br>samples<br>these samples are all from people pretty<br>much in the u.s<br>um and so at the time when billy made<br>these samples he was living in the us<br>and this matches really nicely<br>with the population from the us and what<br>we did then was that<br>we took samples from billy much much<br>later on 40 years later<br>and we looked at those samples in fact<br>those samples now sit way down here<br>okay way away from this population here<br>and that's a really interesting thing<br>because we know that the microbiome<br>changes over your lifetime<br>it drifts it changes as a result of all<br>but there was a graph that some guys had<br>done faith<br>and colleagues i haven't got their name<br>up here sorry but they'd generated this<br>on the basis of<br>an early set of samples out to five<br>years<br>and that extrapolated it out to 50. and<br>we thought that's cool<br>because billy actually gave us the<br>samples that were 46 years apart<br>we thought oh well do they fit on this<br>graph and in fact<br>this graph is amazing right because um<br>out here<br>this is the amount of similarity between<br>billy's samples and if it's right inside<br>the confidence interval on this graph i<br>said<br>this is pretty much a good prediction so<br>if you want to see what your microbiome<br>is going to look like now<br>sequence it drift it about 45 years and<br>you'll know<br>bowen and i were thinking about this and<br>you know we thought what if we can do<br>this the microbiome changes over your<br>lifetime<br>it changes all time right we can<br>manipulate it<br>and so we thought well let's see what we<br>can do<br>so we came up with this idea that turned<br>into the gut bugs project<br>uh which was you might know is the good<br> um<br>which is on tv and these are the people<br>that really did all the work<br>um here karen and fellini but this is<br>the study<br>and what we did was we thought right<br>let's take obesity<br>adolescence and transfer<br>microbiomes from healthy people into<br>them and of course you can't do that<br>using this<br>right and no one's going to eat that um<br>and you can't do it using this right<br>because no one's going to drink that<br>all right it's simple so what we did is<br>we put it inside some capsules<br>right and these capsules they don't<br>taste they don't smell you can't see any<br>color or anything and they're pretty<br>cool<br>and we fed these to a large number of<br>people and that was amazing<br>so we fed them to these people and we<br>looked at the changes<br>over six months and in fact what we<br>found was that<br>at six weeks the people who had<br>metabolic syndrome<br>which is a series of about five<br>different measures which are showing<br>changes in the system that are<br>predisposing towards<br>diabetes we showed that those people<br>that had that when they went into the<br>study and had the fmt<br>that they actually reverted from this<br>and i'll call it pre-diabetic sort of<br>condition although that's not strictly<br>true<br>but pre-diabetic condition um as a<br>result of that fmt<br>and there's been a lot of work done on<br>this and carrying on with this because<br>the cool thing was<br>that our fmt was actually a competition<br>experiment<br>because we gave these people the<br>microbes from<br>four different people and effectively<br>let them compete in the individuals as<br>if the individuals are incubators<br>and it's really neat because what brooke<br>has shown in tommy<br>are that in fact there's a whole range<br>of ways that their microbiomes changed<br>that some people gained new organisms<br>from the donors and we can finger that<br>exactly we can fingerprint the bacteria<br>we know it's exactly the one that came<br>from the donor<br>it went into the recipient it took in<br>the recipient and it stayed in the<br>recipient<br>for up to six months right it changed<br>their microbiome<br>so the microbiomes that we were feeding<br>are actually able to manipulate<br>and change the microbiomes in these<br>people for a long period of time<br>and this is really cool because this<br>opens up whole new avenues<br>for therapies and things when we<br>understand which organisms are critical<br>for making those changes and this has of<br>course led to the new study that we're<br>doing<br>a series of studies we're going to do<br>now again<br>supported by the rockfield trust but<br>it's going in as<br>gut box 2 and we're going to look at<br>various other conditions and run those<br>through<br>shortly but just to finish<br>the futures is a weird thing you know<br>and what we want to do<br>in the future is to use your dna and<br>that of your microbiome<br>to increase well-being and health<br>we don't want to use your dna just for<br>your ancestry or your 23 and me<br>we don't want to use your dna to<br>reconstruct<br>the image of your face even though<br>well we can this is a computer<br>generation from a dna sequence<br>and this is the actual lady that dna<br>sequence came from<br>and this is the same for a bloke so<br>you can do it we don't want to do that<br>the information is there but that's not<br>what we want what we want to understand<br>is how we can apply this<br>to diagnose people who are critically<br>ill<br>and treat people that are critically ill<br>so frank and i<br>and stephen robertson and people from<br>the hospital and hospitals across the<br>country<br>are trying to set up a study now<br>basically<br>to do rapid sequencing of critically<br>ill children and their parents to<br>identify the changes<br>that are specific to the child<br>link that information back to the<br>clinicians along with any potential<br>information that allows them to treat<br>the children so that the clinicians can<br>make a decision<br>as to how they treat the children going<br>forward<br>there are a large number of conditions<br>where if you supplement something very<br>quickly<br>particularly a lot of um epilepsy<br>conditions<br>there's about 130 different<br>presentations of epilepsy in children<br>if you do that in those children you can<br>stop neurodegeneration<br>and long-term developmental effects and<br>it's really important<br>and so we're trying to do this now we<br>know it works in other places around the<br>world<br>we want to do it and so this is franklin<br>and steven here<br>and we believe also that including<br>mutations that are outside of the genes<br>which we've been talking about tonight<br>um how we can interpret those<br>and also your microbiome may be very<br>important for this<br>so to finish i just want to say thank<br>you very much to these people this is my<br>current lab group<br>minus a couple of people unfortunately<br>who weren't at the picture<br>but i want to thank them all very much<br>uh it's it's it's<br>truly a pleasure and honor to work with<br>you all<br>and i want to leave it with my son some<br>time ago<br>which is uh yeah from the mouth to the<br>end again<br>thank you very very much for listening<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
