Biologically-relevant and disordered interfaces just add to the challenge of understanding what is happening in these few nanometers. Ironically, some of the best tools for these tiny lengthscales, neutrons and X-rays, are produced at some of the largest research facilities scattered around the world. This talk will discuss my serendipitous wanderings among these facilities to understand the common features of explosives, functional foods, red wine and cell membranes, and also contemplate some of the other boundaries that academics can wander along.<br><br>Duncan McGillivray is a physical chemist who focuses on characterisation of complex interfaces. He began as an undergraduate at the University of Auckland, studying a BA/BSc in Latin and Chemistry, before heading overseas for a BSc(Hons) at the Australian National University and a DPhil at the University of Oxford. He then worked at the NIST Center for Neutron Research in the US, before returning south when the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering and Australian Synchrotron were opened. He finally returned home to the University of Auckland in 2008 when he was awarded an AINSE Research Fellowship. Duncan has also been the Associate Dean (Academic) for the Faculty of Science since 2016 with responsibility for approximately 10,000 students spread across ten widely diverse schools and departments.<br><br>For more videos from the University of Auckland, visit our YouTube brand channel: https://www.youtube.com/UNIofAUCKLAND</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

welcome you to<br>the inaugural lecture by professor<br>duncan mcgillivran<br>uh the recommendation for duncan's<br>promotion to professor described them as<br>the complete academic and i think that<br>would be a difficult idea to argue with<br>um as a researcher he's a mcdermott pi<br>and he's been part of a prime minister<br>silence advisors report on microplastics<br>he's attracted 10 major grants duncan<br>has<br>about 80 publications with 2700<br>citations including a highly cited<br>nature paper that has the intriguing<br>title of<br>boundary lubrication underwater okay<br>um as we'll hear uh this evening uh<br>duncan's interest<br>in his his research interests indeed<br>personal interests are in inter uh<br>interfaces and connections and boundary<br>conditions<br>and i think that that makes sense given<br>that his undergraduate education was it<br>was a double ba bsc in both chemistry<br>and latin<br>um this also makes duncan one of the few<br>people in the faculty who can argue with<br>me about drama and be probably right and<br>probably where we are<br>as the teacher uh um<br>duncan has won both dean's award for for<br>sustained excellence in teaching in the<br>university of auckland teaching<br>excellence award<br>he's an unusually reflective and<br>innovative educator and eager to embrace<br>new educational thinking and new<br>pedagogies<br>so i hope it's okay with duncan but<br>actually what he's doing tonight is<br>giving a lecture<br>this sort of old-fashioned teaching for<br>that that he won't be able to flip the<br>classroom and that just wants he does<br>have to be the same<br>the sage on the stage um duncan's uh<br>service and leadership record is<br>outstanding<br>um he's carried on the faculty's<br>tradition of having associate dean's<br>academic who come from chemistry i<br>wonder if this joke is going to work<br>whether people are old enough to<br>remember<br>um associate dean's academic who come<br>from chemistry and call duncan<br>something scottish do you remember<br>duncan mclellan who<br>preceded uh jacob mcgillivray in this<br>role<br>um i think he's um even remembering<br>duncan mclean<br>the most effective associated academic<br>that we've ever had and it's<br>simply outstanding for the faculty uh<br>his role<br>in the redesign of the bsc and the<br>introduction of the be advanced science<br>has been<br>enormous and everything that danke does<br>in this space is both thoughtful<br>and insightful and influential his<br>participation in all aspects of uh<br>factory leadership goes well beyond the<br>crawl of duty<br>and he'd be a lot harder to replace them<br>pretty well any of us i think<br>uh certainly having replaced then i<br>would think we would be lost without<br>don't<br>but he does have a weakness i'm not<br>going to blow<br>smoke the whole time he has a particular<br>weakness as a colleague which is his<br>he's a kind of minor's canary<br>in that every time he plans to fly<br>somewhere the country goes back into<br>lockdown<br>so in the hope that he can get through<br>this lecture without that leading to<br>some other<br>externally imposed disaster please join<br>duncan<br>good evening so i am duncan mcgillivray<br>that was the demonstration that i would<br>like to have started<br>this lecture with but when i suggested<br>it to brie who's done all the<br>organization i watched her go to shades<br>paler and<br>brie is very pregnant at the moment so i<br>as i said i'm a born and bred aucklander<br>of scottish and irish ancestry<br>and i'm very very grateful that you've<br>all taken a cold wet<br>rainy evening to come and be here<br>so i'll start with the thanks<br>this is advice i got from justin<br>o'sullivan get it out of the way at the<br>beginning<br>and what i've got to do is i've got to<br>thank lucy my wife and my two children<br>this is us at the van gogh exhibition<br>and i learned at the van gogh<br>exhibition that yellow is the colour of<br>happiness and so we're all going to be<br>very happy<br>so hi iris<br>they've made it here tonight this is not<br>the first lecture that oscar has been to<br>he's been here before those who did chem<br>310 with me will remember him turning up<br>to a poster session some time ago<br>there's a lot more people to thank and<br>i'm not going to do a very good job of<br>it<br>so along the sides all the people have<br>given me money over the years<br>in the middle uh the names of all the<br>co-authors of all my papers there's over<br>200<br>i worked out actually it's more than 200<br>because williams is very big in there<br>only because there's more than one<br>so and it all sort of sits that's a nice<br>sort of chemistry analogy on<br>the soft matter research group which is<br>my research group of phd<br>and postdocs who have actually done most<br>of the work that i'm going to talk about<br>so i'm claiming all the credit for all<br>the work that they've done<br>i hope you don't mind thanks very much<br>this is the about me slide that i give<br>to<br>stage one chemist so this is actually a<br>lecture that i gave earlier today<br>so a few hundred people this is what i<br>said and about me<br>and what it is it seems like a very<br>linear path<br>it seems like start at the beginning<br>next step next step next step<br>this is what working at home was like<br>we're all used to this after 2020. and<br>my life wasn't really like that and i<br>was talking with veleska so i've taken<br>lots of advice about how to give an<br>inaugural<br>lots of people have given me all this<br>wisdom<br>and i've been to quite a few inaugurals<br>myself so um<br>and velasquez said to me oh what you<br>should do is turn it into like one of<br>those superhero origin stories<br>um so particle man<br>there are some obvious flaws in the idea<br>that this is a superhero origin story<br>but i will go back to the beginning so i<br>am the youngest of my family<br>and i'm exceptionally lucky that most<br>in fact all of my siblings are here<br>tonight um and i know how lucky i am to<br>be able to say that including my parents<br>so<br>thank you mom and dad um<br>you can i hope work out which one i am<br>i'm the little one<br>on the way to my 21st my father said you<br>know you're an accident and i was like<br>i had worked that out um so my family<br>have been very supportive and they have<br>shaped me i hadn't really thought that<br>they had shaped me into science and<br>not naming names or pointing fingers<br>these two books are both gifts that were<br>given to me at significant points in my<br>academic career<br>one when i went on to do honours i was<br>given as a gift the book<br>titled the end of science all important<br>scientific questions have already been<br>answered and now we're just messing<br>around the edges<br>and when i went off to oxfords i got the<br>book it doesn't take<br>a rocket scientist great amateurs of<br>science as obviously i was progressing<br>to become a professional scientist<br>so nevertheless lucy my wife who is also<br>an artist<br>discovered an old photo of me at my 10th<br>birthday with a chemistry set so this is<br>her drawing of that photo<br>she adopted it to say 40 because she<br>gave it to me as a 40th birthday present<br>so clearly they were actually you know<br>somehow thinking that i might do<br>science that carried on through so i<br>went to sacramento college i am<br>i wasn't born in auckland but i<br>certainly grew up in auckland i've been<br>here most of my life and there's some of<br>my<br>old classmates from sacramento college<br>up the top there thank you very much and<br>indeed some of my old teachers from<br>sacred heart have come<br>i've come a long way and i apologize now<br>i was talking with my nephew and he said<br>you know it's not about the view again<br>is it so sacred art college actually is<br>in a lovely spot with a fantastic view<br>that was completely wasted on me as a<br>teenager<br>what i did get to do there was a whole<br>bunch of stuff<br>so when i was there i studied french i<br>studied lesson i studied classical<br>studies i studied chemistry physics<br>biology<br>and it was very confusing for me because<br>i kind of enjoyed them all and i wasn't<br>quite sure what i wanted to do<br>and this is my story is kind of a story<br>of a whole<br>bunch of serendipity and accidental<br>happenings and the first of those<br>is probably this i don't<br>to this day remember how i got involved<br>in the chemistry olympiad<br>but it certainly has shaped my life so<br>sheila woodgate<br>was one of the people who was running it<br>she's here today she's been<br>probably known me one of the longest in<br>somehow and i have no idea how i got<br>slept to go to the camp without doing<br>any of the homework<br>somehow and i really don't know how i<br>got selected to represent new zealand i<br>headed off to norway<br>and that was very useful because you<br>know chemistry was kind of<br>exciting for me i did all this stuff<br>because when i applied to the university<br>of auckland to do my<br>undergraduate degree i asked for<br>prospectuses for a whole bunch of<br>faculties<br>because i had no idea what i wanted to<br>do medicine law<br>teaching you know engineering they were<br>all options for me i<br>just didn't know none of them sent me a<br>prospectus<br>even though i asked for all of them and<br>so i more or less<br>ended up just doing what i'd enjoyed at<br>school<br>latin on the one hand chemistry on the<br>other<br>so chemistry while i was here i was<br>taught by such luminaries as<br>sheila penny brothers paul woodgate and<br>stuart rutledge who almost turned me<br>into an organic chemist<br>james wright who's still here brent<br>copp who thought i was okay i don't know<br>if you can read it down the bottom there<br>but good work<br>he said uh gordon misskelley who is now<br>our head of school<br>who was not quite so impressed<br>and funnily enough while i was an<br>undergraduate<br>i met my future father-in-law<br>digging through the old photos so syrian<br>barker who was at the time chance at the<br>university at that point<br>i did not realize he would be my<br>father-in-law clearly not<br>but you know look digging through my old<br>photos over the weekends<br>i found that so that's um quite a nice<br>connection<br>and we've known each other for a while<br>apparently before i really knew lucy<br>actually so coming to the end of my<br>undergraduate degree<br>again i done latin all the way through<br>hi um wasn't sure where to go<br>i realized actually that if you wanted<br>to carry on a career<br>in the classics you essentially had to<br>wait for somebody to die before you<br>could get a job<br>so that was very challenging but there<br>was another piece of serendipity in<br>there i<br>still wasn't really sure what i wanted<br>to do and somebody who was the year<br>ahead of me had done a summer research<br>scholarship at the australian national<br>university<br>in canberra now i barely knew that<br>canberra existed<br>and nobody who ever describes canberra<br>says it's a good place to go<br>but this guy had been there he said it<br>was great fun i wrote a letter<br>thinking that i was an organic chemist<br>now for those of you who aren't chemists<br>there are tribes<br>in chemistry there's the organic chemist<br>the physical chemist the analytical<br>chemists<br>and the inorganic chemists and up until<br>this point<br>i had thought i was an organic chemist<br>it was a narrow escape and so i wrote an<br>application<br>for this research scholarship saying i'd<br>really love to do organic chemistry i<br>really really want to do natural product<br>synthesis<br>and john white completely ignored that<br>so john white is a very influential<br>figure in my story and<br>looking back i kind of realized how much<br>of what i<br>am now is very similar to the kind of<br>mold that john white had<br>so he's an australian who went to the uk<br>fitted<br>right in came back more english in the<br>english<br>collected letters after his name he was<br>at the time the dean of the research<br>school of chemistry and what i didn't<br>realize is what that meant was that he<br>got first pick on the application so he<br>sort of scrolled through obviously had<br>chosen me out<br>completely ignored the fact i wanted to<br>be an organic chemist and said oh you<br>should come across and<br>i was just thrilled to get the<br>scholarship so i was like oh sure great<br>but he talked about the color of<br>neutrons had all these neutrons to<br>measure things they're all different<br>colors and i just had this vision in my<br>head<br>of rainbows and neutrons it was this<br>beautiful thing it was a lie<br>um it was a metaphor he was trying to<br>explain a very technical scientific term<br>by using this but it just fooled me<br>completely<br>he's a very interesting character he<br>taught me a bunch of things that are<br>sort of the<br>bedrock of my toolkit of things that i<br>do<br>um but he was also<br>kind of just a guy who went in and did<br>stuff and sort of thought about it<br>afterwards this is<br>he was the director of one of the major<br>nuclear reactors for research purposes<br>um and you know he was the director he's<br>very big name this is the history of<br>that reactor and in it i've just<br>glancing through discovered this<br>and this is exactly john white you know<br>oh i just did it<br>did you do any missions oh no don't need<br>to just<br>try it he had lots of crazy ideas<br>some of them worked some of them worked<br>very well most of them not so much<br>um so he gave me<br>the basics of what i do now um he taught<br>me<br>about using x-rays so you're going to<br>hear x-rays neutrons<br>these are the things i measure with<br>x-rays everybody knows<br>x-rays you know you go to the dentist to<br>get x-ray see your teeth that's fine<br>um x-rays are very familiar they've been<br>around a long time<br>this image here is from runkin it's one<br>of his first<br>x-ray one of the first x-ray images ever<br>and what it is is it's his wife so he<br>didn't put his own hand down on top of<br>the brand new x-ray thing he sort of<br>shoved his wife's hand down<br>for hand with ring now the x-rays that<br>you're used to at the dentist they're<br>all very well and good they're bright<br>enough you can get them in boxes like<br>this if you want them in your lab<br>but they're not good enough for me i<br>need really really<br>big x-ray sources and so what i have to<br>do to do my measurements is go to a<br>synchrotron now this<br>building here is about a kilometer in<br>circumference<br>the tiny little white dots are sort of<br>cars parked around the outside this is<br>the other thing that he got me hooked on<br>was neutrons<br>now neutrons everybody's familiar with<br>neutrons you've got the center of an<br>atom<br>this is a terrible terrible picture of<br>an atom it's basically<br>wrong in every respect but it's the one<br>we're all familiar with so i threw it up<br>there<br>so in the middle you've got protons and<br>neutrons and it's whizzing around the<br>outside you've got electrons neutrons<br>are the ones that are kind of<br>what's the point they're just neutral<br>they just sit there<br>right uh they're hard to detect<br>it was wasn't even sure they were there<br>there's a new zealand connection<br>anybody want to pull out 100 notes uh<br>ernest rutherford who's on the hundred<br>dollar note<br>was the one who predicted that there was<br>such a thing as a neutron<br>after his prediction it took more than a<br>decade he knew what it was he described<br>but it took more than a decade to find<br>it<br>they're hard to find they're hard to<br>make if you want<br>a beam of neutrons so not in the middle<br>of an atom but just the neutrons by<br>themselves so you can do measurements<br>with it<br>you're going to need a nuclear reactor<br>or a particle accelerator<br>okay nuclear reactor up the top now the<br>kind of nuclear reactors we're<br>interested in aren't your fukushima type<br>nuclear reactors they're much smaller<br>much more useful spellation sources<br>their particle accelerators<br>whack things up really hard smash them<br>into<br>atoms and just see what falls off the<br>key thing about both of these<br>nuclear reactors spallation sources and<br>also the synchrotrons is they're<br>expensive and they're big<br>and they're also in nice places around<br>the world<br>south of france in the middle of an old<br>grenoble there's the esrf one of the<br>brightest x-ray sources that's the big<br>circle there<br>and this little grey blob that's the ill<br>that's where john white was the director<br>one of the brightest neutron sources in<br>the world<br>on the track and the isaiah two lovely<br>little rivers<br>uh the mountains are close if you want<br>to go skiing great place to go to do<br>science<br>there is the oops i went the wrong way<br>the rutherford lab in oxfordshire the<br>rolling plains of oxfordshire little pub<br>villages<br>again you can see in the background<br>there's the ring of the diamond light<br>source<br>this building over here is another<br>particle accelerator for making neutrons<br>oxfordshire lovely part of the world<br>this is the us they don't have<br>everything in one place which is very<br>inconvenient<br>they've got a nuclear reactor near<br>washington they've got<br>a x-ray source that's very good gone lab<br>near chicago<br>they've got a nature on so that's a<br>reactor this is a spallation source down<br>in tennessee<br>tennessee is a very interesting place if<br>you end up going to tennessee there's<br>a lot of pickup trucks<br>and country and western so the thing<br>that<br>is common about all these is that far<br>away<br>so up until quite recently a lot of my<br>science has involved packing samples up<br>carrying chemicals on a plane is very<br>interesting<br>you very carefully learn how to answer<br>the questions so that you don't get the<br>extra search<br>and flying somewhere else right i was a<br>suitcase scientist i did<br>very few of my experiments in the lab<br>normally what i do is i jump on a plane<br>and go somewhere else and do the<br>experiments<br>uh and inevitably that probably would<br>have meant that i wouldn't be<br>here today if it had stayed like that<br>because it's just too hard from new<br>zealand to do that<br>was this a brand new<br>nuclear reactor in sydney the opal<br>that's the open pool australian light<br>water<br>reactor nice little funny acronyms and<br>the australian synchrotron in melbourne<br>so now i don't have to go across the<br>world all i have to do to go<br>is to go to australia which is very<br>convenient<br>except and covered but you know that's a<br>different story<br>the last piece that john white got me<br>hooked on i thought i was going to be an<br>organic chemist he turned me into a<br>surface scientist<br>fascinated in surfaces fascinated in the<br>bit where<br>two places meet this is kind of a<br>textbook definition it's an ill-defined<br>region and when i say surfaces i don't<br>just mean<br>surfaces i mean the molecules right at<br>the very surface when your finger<br>touches that table<br>what is the molecule at the tip of your<br>finger that's actually touching the<br>molecular tip of the table<br>it's where all the interesting things<br>happen when two things interact<br>it happens at the surface it's where<br>they meet that they interact<br>now i'm not really interested in boring<br>surfaces like that i've got a whole<br>range of different surfaces and the ones<br>that i find most fascinating<br>are those that are connected to biology<br>biology from a chemist perspective<br>incredibly complicated we try and<br>simplify it down as much as possible to<br>get just down to the molecules but you<br>know<br>you're just an assembly of atoms really<br>so<br>creating mineral films studying cell<br>membranes looking antimicrobial i'll<br>talk about some of these as we go on<br>um this picture here is probably the<br>most low-res but it's very close to my<br>heart<br>because that is a picture taken from my<br>honors thesis which now seems like a<br>million years ago it was in fact last<br>millennium so<br>and just one last thing<br>a lot of what i do is about interfaces<br>and one of the really key<br>features to bear in mind is this totally<br>simple<br>totally everybody knows this already oil<br>and water don't mix<br>now it started with john white the first<br>example of this that i was interested in<br>are these explosives now i don't know<br>what you think of as explosives i<br>thought before i did this it was kind of<br>the<br>gray stuff that looks like play-doh that<br>you stick on a wall<br>and you you know beep beep beep and it<br>actually most of the mining explosives<br>look more like this<br>this picture here which causes my wife<br>discomfort<br>because it's the little hole thing the<br>black bits are water droplets<br>full of ammonium nitrate the glowing<br>green<br>is diesel so it's just diesel mixed with<br>the water<br>solution of ammonium nitrate just mix<br>them together<br>uh dirt cheap make it by the ton<br>this is not high explosive this is low<br>explosive that just really does the job<br>okay when you mix them together it's a<br>bit like mayonnaise that's an oil water<br>mixture as well it looks a bit like hand<br>cream this white stuff here<br>it won't happen if you just mix diesel<br>and water together it won't actually<br>mix like this it'll just separate back<br>out again what you need is something in<br>between and that's where the science is<br>that's the little<br>interesting little layer around the<br>outside now this is for oraca<br>we did this work and as a good lecturer<br>i know i've talked too long so i've got<br>a little movie for you to show you how<br>so that last explosion is a truck<br>getting exploded they were worried about<br>their explosives falling in the wrong<br>hands they wanted to see if they could<br>put little traces in there<br>explode the truck and still recognize<br>where the explosives came from<br>amazing how you say anything to a little<br>bit of music it sounds very peaceful<br>um so the trick is to do those<br>explosions what they do is they drill<br>holes in the ground they pour this stuff<br>in it's got to sit there for months<br>because it takes months them to drill<br>all the holes and fill them all with<br>that stuff<br>and then they set it off and so i said<br>i'm a suitcase scientist and i travel<br>the world with my samples<br>very interesting to do when the samples<br>you're traveling with are explosives<br>now the way we were doing it they<br>weren't going to explode but i do<br>remember being at canberra<br>airport um and sort of in the security<br>line getting close and sort of noticing<br>that there was a<br>white stain just a you know smear on me<br>i was like what is that what is that<br>and as i was getting closer i realized<br>what it was was ammonium nitrate<br>and you know i just spilt some on me and<br>it's there<br>and of course they pulled me and of<br>course they swiped me and<br>nothing happened which was a bit of a<br>miracle apparently they're only looking<br>for the volatile nitrates so your tnt<br>would have got you<br>but the ammonium nitrate no problem uh<br>it does make me think that if a guy<br>trying to set his shoes on fire<br>in the us made everybody take their<br>shoes off at security ever after<br>what would have happened if they had<br>actually found the explosives on my<br>pants<br>so another bit of serendipity i applied<br>for a scholarship and they sent me a<br>rhodes form<br>i didn't ask for it but they gave it to<br>me and i don't know why i didn't think i<br>was going to get it but i filled it out<br>and next thing i know and actually james<br>was on the selection committee on so<br>she knows better than i do why i'm off<br>to oxford<br>now my oxford experience was completely<br>normal<br>just like everybody's opposite<br>experience i started<br>as a lovely fresh-faced young man their<br>matriculation you know full of ideas and<br>dreams i actually went to my supervisor<br>on the first day and he wasn't there<br>they said come back next week he'll<br>you know he'll be back by then uh it<br>didn't take me long before i sort of<br>sunk down into the depths<br>i rep this is my college st john's<br>college there was always a rainbow<br>always i represented the university<br>uh for a 120th blue probably<br>uh that's the aussie rules team um<br>what do i know about aussie rules not<br>much<br>they needed australians and new<br>zealanders they knew people who they<br>needed people who knew what the game was<br>at all to fill the team out so that was<br>good<br>we did go to buckingham palace i did<br>meet the queen and prince philip and<br>nelson mandela all at the same time sort<br>of packing in your celebrities at one go<br>uh prince philip thought that i was<br>australian so i felt that was a pretty<br>good<br>thing i also met good friends uh one of<br>them<br>uh rob up there is currently in<br>wisconsin he's come from wisconsin<br>to the lecture today he came here<br>deliberately for this so i think that<br>was pretty good effort thank you rob<br>he was always very careful he wanted<br>only good photos of him<br>and i looked through my photos of oxford<br>and they were all bad photos of him<br>and so i went to his web page and found<br>a good photo of him and i've<br>superimposed it<br>so that funnily enough actually rob<br>basically has not changed in 20 years so<br>he kind of did look like that back then<br>as well<br>but i did do some science the whole<br>point of going there was to do my<br>doctorate so i spent three years doing a<br>doctor and what i did my doctorate in<br>was soap so simple<br>surfactant molecule these molecules<br>these ones here<br>um i think my life in terms of red and<br>blue<br>oil and water oil and water don't mix<br>these soap molecules all soak molecules<br>have a red bit and the blue bit and so<br>they're not happy in water and they're<br>not happy in oil and they sit on the<br>boundaries<br>right so this is a class of molecules<br>and you could play with them<br>you could have these uh this one<br>imaginatively named c11 c11 because<br>there are 11 carbons in this tail and 11<br>karma's in that tail but<br>i had c12 c12 and i had c12 c14 i had<br>all these different combinations<br>which doesn't sound very exciting and it<br>probably isn't um<br>but what it did was it made these really<br>interesting structures so these<br>are molecularly thick these are just two<br>molecules thick these black lines in<br>here<br>and without me doing anything they line<br>themselves up into these really<br>interesting shapes all perfectly sized<br>and perfectly spaced i didn't have any<br>control over that it just happened<br>and it only happened next to a surface<br>gave me some really beautiful data i did<br>all this with bob thomas who is another<br>person that i have<br>picked up unwittingly quite a few habits<br>from<br>including the habit of if you look in<br>the background he has<br>filing cabinets full of old data that<br>are really interesting and probably<br>should be published<br>and he's going to get round to it and he<br>but not just getting beautiful data one<br>example is that paper that<br>doug mentioned boundary lubrication<br>underwater<br>it's not what you might think<br>what it was is kind of addressing this<br>challenge you have joints knee joints<br>hip joints that your full weight of your<br>body is on actually quite a small<br>surface area<br>and they're still really slippy it's<br>still very slippery<br>um now normally when you press two<br>things together they don't slip so well<br>so somehow your body does it we're not<br>really sure how<br>but what we discovered or what um a<br>colleague of mine at oxford ruger<br>briscoe discovered<br>i gave him the samples because i had the<br>idea i thought these might be<br>interesting because of their<br>structure and he actually did the<br>back-breaking<br>work of measuring it what he did was he<br>put them in he put them under pressure<br>and he saw that actually these<br>particular molecules<br>were very slippery uh<br>underwater and under high pressure and<br>we had all sorts of ideas about why<br>and got into nature which is a miracle<br>and<br>that was great so i enjoyed it i had a<br>great time i got to travel to grenoble a<br>lot i got to travel to the rutherford<br>lab in oxfordshire a lot<br>i met a lot of good people did a lot of<br>good fun things<br>but i also gave myself a bit of a<br>mid-life crisis<br>because i was also a tutorial fellow at<br>some of the colleges<br>um so oxford tradition<br>you're doing the lecturing one-on-one<br>tutoring it was really good fun i really<br>enjoyed doing it<br>and it came with high table dining<br>rights which you know some of my family<br>came to visit me and i took them<br>i have multiple stories of that<br>including the time when<br>my sister and her husband came to visit<br>us and we went to high table and it's<br>all pomp and circumstance everybody<br>dressed in robes<br>and they served a blood sausage a fry up<br>basically<br>because they'd had all the rich meals<br>they wanted a variety so we had sausages<br>and eggs essentially<br>um all the time i went and they said oh<br>there's been a mistake in your sign up<br>i'm not sure if we can get another<br>pigeon at this short notice<br>and i was very happy that they couldn't<br>so at the end of my doctorate<br>i actually came very very close to<br>returning to new zealand i<br>applied for and actually was given a job<br>at otago university<br>as a lab teaching manager<br>so i was going to be running the lab<br>teaching stuff i came really close to<br>doing that and<br>it'd be interesting to see where i'd be<br>now if i had done that<br>but i also got and this kind of saved me<br>i submitted my thesis by working through<br>the night and printing it at 4am with no<br>sleep<br>by taking it to the binders dropping at<br>their doorstep because they weren't open<br>yet heading to the airport to go for an<br>interview in america<br>uh with matthias lercher and so i<br>arrived sleep deprived<br>probably unshaven probably with wild<br>hair<br>and some reason he gave me a job and he<br>changed my way of thinking because i've<br>been looking at surfaces and things that<br>are interesting at surfaces<br>and he put me onto the biology pathway<br>he made me look at the<br>interesting surfaces of biological ones<br>in particular i spent a lot of time<br>making this both the system that this<br>represents a model<br>cellular membrane so this is the two<br>molecules<br>thick layer that sits on the end of<br>every cell an actual cell membrane and<br>this is the picture stolen from<br>wikipedia is incredibly complicated all<br>sorts of stuff<br>big mixture dynamic fluid changing all<br>the time<br>we worked with a simplified model that<br>captured as much of that as we could<br>right spent a lot of time doing it was<br>very fascinating i also spent a lot of<br>time<br>drawing this particular picture this<br>particular<br>picture took me forever every single one<br>of those little red dots was placed<br>there by hand by me<br>personally they do not tell you<br>that you know if you're going to be a<br>professional scientist<br>you have to be good at doing<br>measurements and analyzing data and<br>figuring out uncertainties and all the<br>rest of that stuff and you also have to<br>be something like a graphic artist<br>a communicator speech writer all this<br>sort of thing<br>but this was a really interesting time<br>so i built these model membranes<br>that are just like cell membranes and<br>the most important parts and then we<br>could start looking at<br>what can you do with that we can look at<br>diseases that affect your cells by<br>damaging the cell membranes because<br>remember that cell membrane<br>that's that layer at the edge of the<br>cell anything that wants to interact<br>with your cells got to come through that<br>cell membrane<br>so it's a very effective gatekeeper but<br>there are no brains in there there's<br>just<br>molecules that just self-assemble by<br>themselves<br>so that was very fascinating the other<br>thing i'd learnt there<br>was that i really like the hands-on<br>building instruments<br>jerrying things together you know things<br>that look like<br>this or like this in reality they look<br>more like that<br>they're things that i've screwed<br>together in america so everything was in<br>inches<br>you had to adapt things you know<br>sellotape here<br>you've got to get it working but also<br>you know micron accurate you've got to<br>program things i really enjoyed doing<br>that i really actually<br>to this day i really hate people who<br>take measurements and get a number and<br>don't figure out<br>how they got that number just what we<br>call black box measurements<br>do a measurement and i've just got the<br>answer how did you get that out so i<br>don't know i got the answer that's<br>enough<br>um i do remember being very offended<br>when i got some ikea kit set stuff<br>and uh andrew christie who's sitting up<br>there said oh you know if<br>you're a scientist you wouldn't know how<br>to put something together<br>but another little fork in the road<br>i came very close to staying in<br>washington dc<br>to keep building this instrument<br>again i was offered the job uh<br>and i decided i didn't i liked the job i<br>liked the people but<br>sort of i wasn't comfortable staying in<br>america this was under george bush<br>many years later i have had no regrets<br>about leaving america<br>but also this was serendipity nuclear<br>reactor opened in<br>um australia john white was at a<br>conference in america and he said oh if<br>you want to come back<br>yeah i've got a job for you<br>so i returned i came back to john white<br>and<br>now as a professor myself as somebody<br>with a research group and research<br>grants<br>i am absolutely amazed that john white<br>could just hire somebody<br>he just had some money he just you know<br>oh yeah yeah sure i can make a job<br>appear for you but he was good at that<br>you know that's one of the things he was<br>good at there is a decade between those<br>two photos of john white<br>uh he did not change and i think to this<br>day he has still not changed<br>he still looks exactly like that he's<br>just preserved i think possibly when he<br>i learned lots of new skills<br>this is a posed photograph uh we took a<br>computer apart but never got it back<br>together again<br>um but you know it was fun uh and i met<br>adam and veleska velasquez<br>has flown from bristol so rob coming<br>from wisconsin for this lecture is not<br>as extreme as veleska coming from<br>bristol in the uk for this lecture<br>solely for this lecture of course and<br>they taught me new skills as well<br>so that's the other demo i wasn't<br>allowed to do in here<br>i got to use the neutrons in sydney i<br>got to get myself established back down<br>this end of the world<br>again i helped to build some instruments<br>there because it was a brand new reactor<br>and they were building new instruments<br>but i also got one more string to my bow<br>thanks to john white<br>milk no new zealand chemist can<br>ever completely get away from milk<br>if you're ever thinking about coming<br>back to new zealand to do some research<br>you know it's probably worthwhile<br>finding out<br>now from my perspective milk is a really<br>interesting system<br>it's a complex suspension of inorganic<br>particles that's calcium phosphate<br>very insoluble in water these are micron<br>size<br>or smaller so they're nanoparticles they<br>are small look that's 14 nanometers<br>that's even smaller than a micron<br>they're not soluble but they're<br>decorated with protein<br>they make these big fuzzy there's<br>protein all there lots of water lots of<br>calcium in there<br>think about it these are things oil<br>there's fatty globules and milk there's<br>this calcium that's insoluble<br>it's incredibly stable you can<br>completely dry it out<br>and then make it come back together<br>again it's just fine you can boil it<br>you can freeze it you know there's all<br>these things you can do and actually<br>milk is robust to all of that it's a<br>fascinating system from a biophysical<br>perspective<br>john white being john white he wasn't<br>satisfied with that what he did was say<br>well here's milk and it's very<br>interesting nobody actually by the way<br>really knows how it fits together either<br>that was part of the question<br>you know we know the pieces that are<br>there but we don't actually really know<br>how they stick together<br>this is some of our work showing that<br>how we think it sticks together but it's<br>very hard to prove<br>because it's so accurate and nebulous<br>john said well milk's milk but what i<br>really want to do is squash milk<br>so two gigapascals of pressure um i'm<br>trying to find an analogy it's kind of<br>like you got your bottle of milk and you<br>drove a truck over it<br>but more so even worse than that<br>uh when you squash it really really hard<br>like that was a huge<br>piston thing big thing squashing<br>what happens is this falls apart and<br>then as it falls apart and then you take<br>the pressure off you can watch it<br>reassemble you can find out a bit more<br>about how it works and that was that was<br>the idea<br>um but actually that opened up a whole<br>new avenue of interesting stuff of what<br>i've done<br>since which is there's a lot of diseases<br>that are involved<br>proteins which are the machinery in your<br>body not working the way they're<br>designed<br>they're very beautiful machines they do<br>things but if they<br>misfold they're in the wrong shape they<br>can do all sorts of strange things<br>and there are a number of diseases about<br>that but what it's hard to do<br>is on purpose misfold a protein and<br>stop it partially misfolded so you can<br>look at what's happening on the way<br>because what happens when they<br>fall apart is that they kind of just<br>clump together and do all sorts of<br>interesting things really quickly<br>and they don't come back so you can't do<br>it come back<br>with pressure you can actually slow that<br>down<br>and look at them fall apart come back<br>together again and so i did a bunch of<br>work<br>uh involving how things fall apart<br>which started by what happens if you<br>take some milk from the dairy this is<br>not<br>you know special milk milk from the<br>dairy<br>whack it in this really big machine and<br>squash it really hard and see what<br>happens<br>but by then i was really close to home<br>where i really wanted to be was back in<br>new zealand<br>i had family close to family again<br>i had a future wife who's run off on me<br>but you know i dared to meet her at that<br>point but i needed to get back to new<br>zealand so that i could<br>and i was very very fortunate that the<br>australian institute of nuclear science<br>and engineering of which the university<br>of auckland<br>is one of the members had a fellowship<br>scheme<br>and thanks to again a bit of serendipity<br>i won one of those fellowships so i've<br>got to thank jim matson who was head of<br>chemistry at the time and thought it<br>would worthwhile<br>taking part in this and i've got to<br>thank david williams because<br>i'd left new zealand when i was an<br>undergraduate i had no idea other than<br>brent and gordon and the people who had<br>taught me anything about the<br>research environment in new zealand i<br>had no collaborators here<br>so i just went on to google and googled<br>neutron and david williams name popped<br>up<br>now it turns out david williams doesn't<br>actually do a lot of neutron stuff but<br>he had done one<br>and he said oh yeah come across i'll<br>host you for a talk i came to auckland<br>it was a rainy wet miserable day i gave<br>a talk and i thought i actually really<br>like it in auckland<br>even on a rainy wet miserable day um i<br>was staying at my brother's house<br>out and beach center's taking the ferry<br>in<br>and you know going across the harbour to<br>work it was just really nice<br>so i came back and one of the things<br>that i studied was i looked at these<br>cell membranes that i'd spent all this<br>time in america developing a great model<br>and thought what can i do with it one of<br>the things i can do with<br>it is<br>look at how they behave when they're<br>damaged<br>and the damage i was looking at was<br>oxidation<br>so this is the sort of thing that uv<br>light does this is the sort of thing<br>that smoking does it's one of the ideas<br>that this<br>buildup of damage over a long period of<br>time<br>leads to cumulative aging<br>effects and potentially you know<br>diseases like a whole range of diseases<br>actually you know depending on the<br>flavor of the day you can blame this<br>blame everything on this so we wanted to<br>take it right back to the basics<br>humans over 50 years it's really hard to<br>figure out what's really going on and<br>why they're getting old<br>uh let's just go back at the cell<br>membranes and see what happens when we<br>damage those<br>uh long story short we stuck a whole<br>bunch of defense mechanisms your body's<br>defense mechanisms we stuck a whole<br>bunch of<br>things on there and what we found was<br>actually it does make a difference and<br>we could sort of pinpoint<br>how your body's defense mechanisms<br>slowly broke down they still worked<br>their whole job is to clean up things<br>like<br>damaged lipids but they don't work so<br>well the more damage it is so this is<br>something that actually does have kind<br>what can you do about it antioxidants<br>big name<br>everybody wants to have antioxidants<br>massive industry i mean this is 20 years<br>out of date but<br>20 billion dollars for supplements in<br>the u.s alone<br>people taking antioxidant pills these<br>sorts of things<br>almost universally without any real<br>evidence that they do anything<br>right so that's kind of like 20 billion<br>dollars down the drain<br>and what we're interested in doing is<br>actually what appears to be much more<br>effective<br>is eating fruit and vegetables because<br>it's not just<br>the antioxidant by itself it's the<br>antioxidant in a complex environment<br>and how that all works together to make<br>a difference<br>so we're trying to take those things and<br>make them better because that's how you<br>make money so<br>not yet but a really antioxidant rich<br>food that i'd like to get into the<br>research of and so we do have a wine<br>science research<br>here i'm going to be working with them<br>red wine unfortunately smoothies work<br>just as well actually<br>so we'll go with that<br>okay so that that's what got me here<br>that was my first major research grant<br>by the way i got a marsden fund to<br>do that research when i got to new<br>zealand<br>the question is what am i doing now<br>and what i did was i actually asked my<br>phd students<br>to send me a slide of the most<br>interesting stuff so everything you see<br>here now is what my phd students<br>thought was their most interesting stuff<br>so<br>you can judge for yourself whether you<br>think it's interesting or not i could<br>have talked about<br>antimicrobial proteins so my is working<br>on antimicrobial<br>proteins uh with vg theragenia and<br>chemistry dane ellison is helping with<br>some of the computational modelling<br>trying to figure out you know we're all<br>heading towards a state where<br>antibiotics don't work anymore<br>because the antibiotic those sort of<br>bacteria are getting better at defeating<br>them and we're not really spending that<br>much effort trying to upgrade our<br>ammunition<br>what that could mean is we're in a place<br>where you know a serious break of your<br>leg you're going to amputate<br>it's kind of scary so we've got to try<br>and think of better ways of doing it and<br>some of what we're doing is actually<br>looking at how you kill bacteria<br>well we look at other bacteria they're<br>fighting bacteria all the time they're<br>in a big tussle for resources so we take<br>some of their tools and try and figure<br>out how they work<br>how they do that so that's one thing i'm<br>not going to talk about that beyond what<br>i've just said<br>functional foods this is turmeric<br>great antioxidant very uh healthy thing<br>you can get your<br>turmeric lattes you can get all sorts of<br>things turns out<br>very very hard to get it actually into<br>your body<br>right so you get into your stomach and<br>it just<br>carries on through because it's really<br>hard to get it into your bloodstream<br>so we've got to figure out clever ways<br>of getting it into your body i'm not<br>going to talk about that beyond that one<br>either<br>surface structures zainab sent me this<br>picture um<br>we have these really interesting<br>molecules and we're really curious about<br>lining them up in nice ordered<br>structures but they're<br>molecules right how do you line up<br>something that small<br>so she's been working really hard on<br>ways of getting those surfaces well i'm<br>not going to talk about that beyond that<br>either<br>i am going to talk a little bit about<br>plasma coating<br>so this is a video that shows a plasma<br>atmospheric plasma jet in operation<br>what we see is an aerosol going through<br>and a plasma plasmas are the fourth<br>state of matter<br>uh but for our purposes they're just a<br>big glowing glass<br>gas big glowing gas<br>right and what this gives us the<br>opportunity to do is put tiny droplets<br>and get them onto a surface and then we<br>can print onto a surface<br>a bit like a inkjet printer but with<br>molecules<br>and we have the opportunity to get all<br>sorts of interesting things onto a<br>surface that are hard to do<br>normally if i've spent my entire career<br>doing surface coatings<br>of molecules on surfaces and it usually<br>involves dipping something in a beaker<br>of something and stirring and hoping and<br>then rinsing and<br>it's very messy what this does uses tiny<br>amounts of liquid it's much more<br>sustainable and lets you put interesting<br>things on surfaces and nice little<br>patterns as well<br>what can you do with that well that's<br>what daniella who's my postdoc<br>is in here somewhere and robert are<br>working on<br>one of the things you can do is you can<br>put down<br>titania on and away makes a nice little<br>orange thing<br>to make really low-cost but highly<br>reproducible air sensors so that we can<br>put air sensors all over the place<br>this is working with a company called<br>aerocoil<br>it's another david williams connection<br>uh<br>with iodinka who works with conducting<br>polymers we're thinking about ways we<br>can print a conducting polymer instead<br>of having to do it through a solution<br>have it connected on the surface and<br>have it work and then what could you do<br>with that um<br>with jeff wilmot we're hoping that we<br>can do interesting things to make<br>droplets of water behave the way we want<br>them on surfaces splash in the direction<br>you want them to splash<br>or flow in the direction you want them<br>to flow<br>so there's lots of interesting things we<br>can do with that the other one i wanted<br>to spend a little bit of time on was<br>nanoplastics so doug mentioned that i'd<br>spent some time<br>in the prime minister's chief science<br>advisor's office which<br>sounds more glamorous than it is the<br>actual office is not that flash<br>uh but the work they do is it's really<br>interesting<br>what they do um and one of the things<br>they just did<br>they released this in late 2019<br>was thinking about plastics in our<br>waterways eight<br>million tons of plastic go into the<br>ocean each year<br>right and that's just the bits that's<br>not on purpose that's sort of the<br>accidental leakage<br>the new zealand numbers you know it's<br>350 000 tons but it's really hard to<br>tell how much there is<br>when it's a plastic bag a turtle chews<br>it chokes dies that we know that's bad<br>that's easy to understand<br>but what we're looking at are these<br>broken down bits of plastic a plastic<br>bag breaks down into<br>shards of plastic which breaks down into<br>beads of plastic which breaks down into<br>nanoparticles of plastic and when<br>they're really really small they're far<br>too small for us to see<br>but they are able to get through your<br>body's defenses they're so small they<br>can get through your body's defenses<br>and do all sorts of interesting things<br>including potentially<br>damaging muscles um from a new zealand<br>perspective so shinji<br>who was a phd student and is now a<br>postdoc who was also an intern<br>in juliet gerard's office<br>has spent his time looking at<br>nanoplastics<br>and it's not just the plastic it's the<br>shape of the plastic it's not just the<br>shape of the plastic it's what the<br>plastic's made of<br>it's not just what plastics made of it's<br>what goes on the outside of the plastic<br>and then how that interacts with<br>your body it's a really complicated<br>system that he's been trying to<br>untangle one of the things that i found<br>really kind of disturbing he has flowed<br>these plastics past<br>human cells the blue blurriness<br>in there is dna and the green<br>is the nanoplastics right in the nucleus<br>or next to the nucleus of the cell<br>i actually had to go into mike hosking<br>to talk about this sort of thing<br>the message there was don't panic we've<br>been eating plastic for 50 years we're<br>not dead yet but actually<br>maybe we're not as good as we could be<br>so<br>and then the last thing i wanted to talk<br>about as i getting right to the end of<br>my time<br>was uh changes about<br>five years ago my life got quite a bit<br>more interesting<br>uh it took up quite a lot of my time<br>some really late nights quite a lot of<br>patience<br>quite a lot of frustration last couple<br>of years<br>got even harder and of course i mean<br>i got the associate dean job because my<br>children<br>i've chosen this picture to represent my<br>associate dean because this is the part<br>that they did not put in the job<br>description<br>and i did not realize until i'd had the<br>job for a couple of months that one of<br>the things you have to do is you have to<br>go up on stage at vector arena<br>if you think this is a crowd that's you<br>know packed out 5 000<br>that is terrifying um<br>fun but terrifying so jr<br>so what does it mean to be associate<br>team academic it has actually taken<br>of my official time a minimum of half of<br>my time for the last five years or so<br>in practice it's the kind of funny<br>mathematics that our mathematics<br>department does half of your time being<br>associate team half of your time doing<br>everything else<br>plus having a family adds up to about<br>300 of your time<br>uh some facts about our faculty we're<br>huge<br>we've got something like 8 200<br>equivalent full-time students that<br>really means<br>more than 10 000 bodies come and study<br>some part of science here<br>okay 10 000 people roughly 3 000 new<br>students every year<br>somewhere of the order of 16 of those<br>are international which obviously in<br>2020<br>is a big thing because we've got to deal<br>with that as well it's a big chunk of<br>our money<br>we've got 10 different schools of<br>departments one of the first jobs you<br>have to do when you're in my job is<br>figure out what they are<br>so their stats mathematics chemistry<br>physics biology<br>psychology marine science exercise<br>sciences<br>environment oh crap<br>computer science how could i forget<br>computer science<br>um as our you know dearly departed dean<br>was a computer scientist we've got 25<br>different degrees only two of them are<br>undergraduate one of them i had to<br>introduce<br>but the rest are all master's degrees<br>postgraduate diplomas i'm the one who's<br>supposed to understand the rules behind<br>all of these<br>we introduced six brand new masters this<br>year so i had to help do that<br>it's worth keeping perspective that the<br>faculty of science is about a 300<br>million dollar<br>revenue business every year just the<br>faculty<br>uh roughly two-thirds of that is<br>teaching related<br>um so it's a very significant thing but<br>i think and it covers all sorts of<br>interesting stuff i mean it's a really<br>this is what i think is really<br>interesting i like being at edges<br>we've got psychology geography we've got<br>exercise sciences marine we've got all<br>these different things they all cross<br>over and they all talk to each other<br>which is really<br>great but i think the thing that's most<br>interesting to me<br>is you know let's take sustainability<br>university particularly faculty of<br>science has challenges with<br>sustainability because we fly all over<br>the place<br>right so we can think about ways to do<br>things and that will reduce our<br>footprint and that's great<br>but our much much much greater impact<br>is if we can educate a generation of<br>students who understand what<br>sustainability is and why it's important<br>and what we can do about it so you know<br>we can do things but actually our<br>influence is massively multiplied by<br>what we do with our students<br>so that's you know for me that's that's<br>why i'm doing what i'm doing<br>there's all sorts of interesting<br>problems um i just chose this we've done<br>school leavers coming in 60<br>of them those so it's only school<br>leaders who think they might want to do<br>60<br>of them think they're going to go on to<br>postgraduate<br>um in fact about sort of 10 percentage<br>do<br>so i've got to understand why is it they<br>think they want to do postgraduate and<br>then most of them<br>don't but equally when we ask our<br>postgraduates<br>people who are doing doctorates or<br>masters and say when did you decide<br>they only decided one-third of them only<br>decided in their very last year of<br>undergraduate<br>not until that moment it ever occurred<br>to them they might go on and do more<br>right so we've got these really<br>interesting challenges you know we want<br>graduates we want people to be able<br>because when you get to be a graduate<br>you start<br>inventing new stuff how do we encourage<br>that how do we make that happen<br>the world has changed um<br>education is changing too we're not<br>doing the same things that we were doing<br>20 30 years ago so yeah uh<br>mostly we don't just stand and lecture<br>anymore mostly we try and do something<br>more interesting doug is right this is<br>one of the few occasions where somebody<br>just stands here<br>um danny was asking me are you going to<br>ask questions of the audience<br>you know because in lectures you ask<br>questions the audience have this big<br>long awkward silence and<br>it's a battle of wills it's like who's<br>going to break first<br>are they going to answer i said to them<br>i'm not asking it here because if i ask<br>a question here<br>somebody will answer and that's<br>terrifying<br>but you know<br>things are very different it doesn't<br>it's not about knowledge anymore<br>you want to know something you google it<br>and then you have the data at your<br>fingertips<br>it's understanding discernment it's<br>understanding what's<br>good data and what's bad data and how<br>can you can tell it's understanding<br>skills<br>what you can do with things there's a<br>whole bunch of stuff in there<br>i think one of the the key things is<br>that science is really central to our<br>society now<br>everything we do is in some way related<br>to<br>science just the underpinning technology<br>but not by itself right there's no point<br>having a really amazing covert vaccine<br>for example<br>if people are unwilling to have it<br>injected into their bodies<br>right so science doesn't exist in<br>isolation we need people who aren't<br>scientists to understand science and we<br>need scientists to understand people who<br>aren't scientists<br>we need these divisions and labors and<br>no<br>none of these big problems we've got can<br>be solved by any one of these<br>disciplines alone<br>so you know i think we've got a real<br>challenge of how to<br>integrate ourselves better with<br>everybody else<br>uh which i think you know sort of sum up<br>in the last sort of flash of photos<br>it's about generations for me so this is<br>me talking to early childhood education<br>teachers<br>with my own children of about that age i<br>understand just how much<br>you know preschoolers are actually<br>natural scientists they're just<br>exploring all the time<br>you know we're trying to break down this<br>idea that science is about knowing stuff<br>it's about<br>discovering stuff i've got high school<br>in there that's the chemistry olympiad<br>so i've been lucky enough to be involved<br>with some really good high school<br>undergraduate that's chem 310 we get<br>them into labs and get them<br>doing experiments phd students that's my<br>first phd student and of course<br>my own children um<br>this is them eating the pasta that<br>they actually made themselves uh while i<br>was teaching the chemistry olympiad one<br>of the other teachers took them<br>to make pasta and they made it<br>themselves<br>i'm not actually sure i want them to be<br>scientists though so<br>so yeah am i i think it's a pipe i'm<br>gonna get people all the way through<br>um that's it i'm really really glad<br>that's over<br>unfortunately it's right at the end of<br>the time<br>no time for questions so sorry but thank</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
