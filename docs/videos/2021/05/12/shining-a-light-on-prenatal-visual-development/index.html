Professor Vincent Reid, head of the School of Psychology at the University of Waikato, is an expert in prenatal visual development – an entirely new field of research. His work with Waikato District Health Board’s ultrasound clinic could open doors into understanding human development and fetal health. He spoke about his research for National Psychology Week 2021.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>what are the origins of<br>psychological development what we're<br>looking to do is actually create a new<br>research field<br>in psychology which is to do with fetal<br>perception<br>how we see things how we feel things<br>that's what perception is all about<br>we know quite a lot about how adults see<br>the world about how adults<br>understand the way in which we interact<br>with the world that we're in<br>but we don't know that much about<br>entrance and we don't know that much<br>about fetuses<br>so we're looking at how the fetus can<br>see and we need to understand how<br>fetuses see because that's<br>where we understand development in all<br>humans fetal vision is one of the most<br>important things for us to investigate<br>because understanding infants and<br>understanding later development<br>comes from fetal processing so our way<br>of understanding the development of<br>vision is based on<br>early development the earliest forms of<br>development we can look at<br>are through fetuses so we're working<br>with the waikato dhb<br>through shining lights through mum's<br>bellies<br>to the fetus to see what the fetus is<br>going to do when they respond to this<br>information<br>we're asking questions like how does the<br>visual field<br>change in early development when you<br>start off with babies they have a very<br>narrow focus<br>they can only look at certain parts of<br>the visual world they<br>don't have that much of an understanding<br>of the periphery<br>of our visual sense fetuses probably<br>have the same sort of problems and same<br>sort of issues related to how they see<br>the world<br>we don't even know so what we're looking<br>to do<br>is to try and understand how a fetus<br>sees and why it sees the way that it<br>does<br>our marsden funded research with the<br>waikato dhb<br>lets us see how the fetus understands</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
